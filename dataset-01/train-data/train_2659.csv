2,Not so great,"Like her other book, Least Wanted, this one has too many characters and it is too hard to keep track of them. Plus some of the story lines do not seem plausible. I would not read any more of her books, if she writes them."
2,Boring,"I'm sorry, I don't understand how this book got such good reviews. I kept trying to get interested, but it actually put me to sleep. I gave up about 3/4 of the way through. I just didn't care how it ended."
3,Holes in story..,"It was a fun read but there were a couple of holes in the story. The biggest one being when Sam gets beat to a pulp and spends a week in the hospital. There is no mention of the police being involved or of the medical people questioning just how she got her injuries...would just not happen that way. By the apparent fact that there were no police investigating, it impacts how the rest of the story unfolds. Hopefully in future novels she will pay more attention to details of this sort."
3,Quite liked it!,"Great 1st novel, Debbie!While I was reading it, I enjoyed the characters. I agree with one comment, that the identity thief could have been explained a bit better. However, overall it was a good read. I'm already reading Least Wanted and enjoying it a lot. I'm wondering how well the embellishment plot will be worked out after the comments about the identity thief. Still, a great read so far and I think this author will do well."
4,Buy it.,"Debbi Mack has written a satisfying suspense novel that introduces Sam McRae as a hero worth following. I haven't yet read her next adventure,Least Wanted, but I will, and I encourage all who read this to do the same. Sam is a workhorse, a former lawyer and now PI who is simultaneously working on her own identity theft issues as she helps her client with a murder investigation. This is a book with many plot twists, including a big one at the ending. I never felt it took advantage of me with convenient solutions or contrived problems, like many of this genre do. Tightly written and good fun."
5,Comedy Classics,"A must have for Carry On fans, and a great introduction for those that have had the misfortune of not being exposed to the comedic talents of Hattie Jacques, Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, and of course Barbara Windsor, amongst many others. I grew up watching these movies back in Britain, and I now have the pleasure of handing down that tradition to my own kids. Even with their innuendos, the Carry On team provide a more family friendly movie experience than some of today's so-called comedies. The box set contains 1170 minutes of genuine British comedy at its finest."
5,The Funniest!,"If you like to laugh, get this set. We discovered the Carry-On series years ago on TV, and having all of them on DVD is perfect. Here you have an hilarious ensemble cast of very funny English actors performing some really funny scenes."
2,This author can do better then this...,"I'm guessing this is one of Ms Ranneys earlier work, because her later books are nothing like this. As many stated here, the heroine and the hero are both unlikeable, her love scenes are lack luster ( 3 scenes in the whole book, rest are just vaguely hinted at ).Disliking the hero/heroine aside, the main reason why I found this book to be a bore is because there was just way too much internalization. The internal monologue just went on and on without any action.In a word, this book was just tedious."
2,Information Help,Can you please email me and give me a summary of what the book-Deadline- by Hilda Stahl is about. My email address is bubbles_sw50@hotmail.com. Please email me before the7th. Allyson
2,Over rated ...,"This book contains 90 pages of (mostly) multiple choice questions with the answers at the back of the book. It is the type of material that routinely follows a chapter in any textbook. Though the questions are to the point, my objection is that it is published as a separate book at the price of many complete works. Properly published, these questions would not add 90 pages to the original text which was itself under 300 pages. The questions did not help me understand the material, only tested my recollection. I feel that publishing this material as a workbook is only a marketing ploy and cheapens the product."
5,Excellent Book to Accompany the Options Course Book,I used this book in tandem with the OCB to pull the points that I wanted to understand. The author has used the additional book to ensure that each chapter of the OCB is pointed and hits the mark.This book is a must to purchase at the same time as his first book Options Course Book. Great idea to reinforce for the reader the salient points that you want to get overThank you Mr. FontanillsDana
1,CD,Enjoyed the movie & I love James Horner's movie scores.I plan to use it for a slide show I am making.
5,The New World Soundtrack,"I have followed the career compositions of James Horner for so many years now and delight as I listen to each new rendering of soundtracks, picking out bits and pieces of his other works which he cleverly interweaves into each movie soundtrack. The Man is pure genius, likened to Bernard Herrmann and of course, Horner has evolved into MUCH, MUCH MORE. I go to the movies and before the credits, I am usually able to tell if Horner wrote the music. This lovely cd is resplendent in peace, pristine beauty, haunting as are most of his scores. I wish many more of his earlier works had been burned on cds. Definitely a keeper!!! Everytime you listen, you will ""become"" the music"
1,Thanks for the Money Save,"Thanks to all the posters who saved me some cash! I just saw the movie about an hour ago, and was exceedingly moved by the score. I thought the soundtrack would have almost certainly contained the haunting, stirring piece from the score of the movie that was played during certain key scenes at the beginning and end. I was even about to buy the first track of this CD online (after previewing the 30 second clips you can play online) on the off chance that it may have contained that piece. How wrong I would have been.Because of your reviews, especially 'o dubhthaigh's' I saved my $.99 and downloaded the right song!It is most certainly Wagner's Das Rheingold - Vorspiel.James Horner is good, but not that damned good.I'm giving it a single star because of the deception, but those of you who posted the great tip get 5 stars!Oh, and if you haven't seen the film, you simply must see it soon before it leaves the theater. It's a breathtaking work of stunning beauty not to be missed!"
1,Not the music from this movie,"This is not the music from the movie. This purchase was a Major dissapointment. You would do beter searching for the music credits for titles, then download the tracks form your music subscriber."
2,"Songs Missing, Please, Anybody??","I'm interested in the name of the song sung to Pocahontas as the Playwright reads her the Welcoming Ode.The only actual piece in the movie that came from the portrayed timeperiod. I'm an Early Music fanatic, and I'd appreciate it very much if anybody could answer that question for me.V."
2,Braveheart meets classical music,"As soon as I watched this movie and heard the music, I immediately knew James Horner had composed the soundtrack. It sounds far too much like Braveheart, mixed in with some classical music. It doesn't really strengthen the film and in fact sometimes sounds out of place. Just buy Braveheart instead."
3,Songs not on the soundtrack,"Hi,i was just wondering if anyone had those songs that were not on James Horner's soundtrack. I was just looking for those 2 songs: the one that starts the movie (Wagner: Das Rheingold - Vorspiel, and the other is piano (Mozart: Piano Concerto 23 - Adagio)... if u do have them can u send it over thru email (Jeffrey.Wang@student.ucr.edu)much appreciated - jeff"
1,Music not from the movie!,"So disappointing to get this soundtrack, fast forward through the entire CD looking for anything that sounded familiar from the movie, only to find track after track of poorly recorded movie background sounds. The movie itself has powerful, emotion gripping scenes with little dialog, but lots of music that gets right at your heart. None of this is on the CD."
5,You will not regret getting this!,"I knew a little about Jane Goodall's life before I bought this dvd, but was simply astonished after watching it to realise the great depth of her life's commitment to serving this planet earth so lovingly, unconditionally and utterly self-givingly. Her work is extraordinary, but what I found most inspiring and what has left a deep impression on my heart, is the remarkable peace and poise that radiates from her. An incredible life and knowing more about it, I feel, has made me a better person. Gratitude!"
4,Janes Journey,"The movie is 5 star for me. However the producer, Mongrel,has no language, subtitle or bonus features. Other versions have these interactive menus."
5,Theory helps make good practice,"Unlike many other texts and authors on this subject, Trompenaars has undertaken extensive background and rigorous research. The authors interpret the research in a very practical way making the conclusions generalisable to any manager.A must for today's manager, whether global or dealing with diversity."
5,A Great Introduction to Intercultural Understanding,"At last from Europe, a clear, concise, readable explanation of the critical dimensions of international management. It places culture in a perspective that allows for applications internationally and within the diversity of single nations.David C. Wigglesworth, Ph.D. is an international/intercultural human resource, management, and organization consultant and president of D.C.W Research Associates International in Kingwood, Texas, USA.

1,Horrible,"I threw away my money on an Equity Insta-Set alarm clock. ""You never have to set it"" - this is only true if you would like your alarm clock to tell you the wrong time. I live in Florida. Right now, it is 4:43 PM and we are on Daylight Savings Time. According to my new Equity Insta-Set clock, it is 6:39 AM, for an error of 10 hours and 4 minutes. If you want your clock to show you a time that is 10 hours and 4 minutes off from the real time, you'll love the Equity Insta-Set.Maybe there is a way to remedy the situation... I can't tell because there is no SET button and the clock didn't come with any instructions.Worthless."
1,Inaccurate time!,"I agree with the other reviewers - this clock is a waste, as it doesn't keep the correct time and there is no way to manually adjust it. Ours has creeped away from the correct time until it's now 10 minutes off. Don't waste your money on this one!!"
1,Very disappointed,"The time is manually set at the factory and all you have to do is adjust for your time zone. When I did this, the clock was two minutes slow. No big deal I thought, tonight it will sync with the atomic clock like my two atomic watches always do. Next morning it was still two minutes slow. The following night I tested it by placing it in a window next to one of my atomic watches. In the morning it was still two minutes slow. The atomic watch grabbed the correct time as soon as it turned on to search at 12:00 A.M.I returned the clock."
1,Not worth it.,"The product is a waste of good money, it does not automatically set time and when needed most at night, it powers down and is almost impossible to read time without standing one foot away. It was also extremely difficult to set correct time. save your money...."
1,Useless as a clock...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Has not had the correct time since I bought it...always fast. First just a minute or two, now about 10 minutes. Since I can't find the original box or my receipt, it's headed for the trash. The people who sell it have a lot of nerve saying you never have to set it, which is almost impossible anyway and it doesn't work for very long when you do try to reset it, just resets itself to the wrong time. PIECE OF JUNK."
3,NOT an atomic clock ... but OK,"This clock will keep time if unpluged (or during a breif power outage) without the 9V battery installed which is a nice feature. The alarm is loud enough to wake me up but no so loud that it's overly obnoxious. I also like the blue, self dimming LED display.However, it is not a self-setting atomic clock even though it is advertised as such. I find that I sometimes accidentally activite the time zone switch when trying to turn the alarm on or off. I've also had the DST function automatically adjust in the middle of the night (not realizing the date was set incorrectly) and ended up being late for work.When the clock was a few years old I discovered one day that the time had advanced 20 minutes on its own. After searching for a few minutes on-line I discovered that the time and date can be set manually by pressing and holding the ""alarm"" button.This is n OK alarm clock. But it is not self-setting, nor are the DST and Time Zone settings necessary in my opinion."
2,Not a good product,"1. Instaset did not work, was 30 minutes off2. LED numbers are too dim to read clearly3. Overall it gives off a lot of light at night, like having a small lamp in the room"
2,Short lived,"This clock worked fine for a while then the light went out !!! It is still working, but you can't see the numbers. I would not buy this item again."
1,Works until just after the warranty expires,"Not long after the warranty expired, the clock stopped keeping accurate time. I was able to set the time, per the instructions, but the time doesn't progress like it should. The hour and minute separator (the colon) blinks slower than once per second, and the minutes advance about one for every three minutes that my other clocks show.This is basically pitiful performance. Most digital clocks that I've had keep on working forever - even if you have it 10 years or more. This one just doesn't cut it."
1,Hunk of junk,"Should have listened. Time is off by 11 minutes and after a half hour working on it by following all directions, it is still slow. Also, hard to see across the room. Looks nice, just doesn't work."
1,Readout Cannot be Seen,The clock cannot be seen in the dark. The blue color is not brigth enough and you have to be right next to it to make out the time.
2,Intense Oracle,This book is not for the squeamish. I didn't like it since its just as hard to read as the on-line documentation. But it covers how to optimizing the database in depth (if thats what you need).
3,A little Irritatating,"# 1 is feel- which has a good beat but the Japanese vocals are so irritating. 3/5# 2 Go dream- AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! oh no it sounds so horrible!! 1/5# 3 Endles Love, endless Road- this is a pretty much okay track, where Tidus and Yuna sing together. 3/5# 4 Feel instrumental- the greatest one- good beat, like i said in the first one- but no annoying vocals 10/5 (My fav)# 5 Go Dream Instrumental- Its a horrible rock song.... 1/5(sorry)# 6 Same as first"
4,good series,A good easy read series. Like reading the series. Had read some of the newer books so wanted to go back to the beginning to follow the entire series
3,What???,"This ended up on my Kindle. I swear I didn't order it. So I give it three stars for magically appearing. I must have pushed the wrong buttons, huh?"
4,Worthwhile for fans; included with the 10th Anniversary Collector's Edtiion,"I first saw this documentary on PBS when it was first produced (1988?) I hadn't seen the musical yet, but I fell in love with the music and the concept. In particular, I loved Linzi Hateley as Eponine singing ""On My Own"" as well as excerpts from foreign non-English productions.I probably wouldn't buy this by itself, but when I found out that it is now packaged as Disc 2 of ""Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Concert Two Disc Collector's Edition,"" I jumped at the chance to get it."
4,Interesting,"This video came out when Les Miserables was beginning its phenomenon. Now it's bigger that what was expected. I thought it very interesting to see all the backstage stuff and comments from Cameron Mackintosh and Claude Michel Shonberg and Alain Boublil. The musical has made itself into a life of its own and seeing everything going on afterwards is interesting. The magic is still there though and from the comments of the producers and creators, it's obvious that their whole hearts and souls were put into making this musical. This is great for anybody that enjoys the musical."
2,Eh...,"A so-so book. Good for a light read on the beach, but if you're looking for something to actually stimulate your brain, you'd be better off with a different book. I personally didn't like it much."
2,Lame story with a recycled plot,"Having loved Roz Bailey?s first novel, Party Girls, I picked up Girls? Night Out with utmost anticipation. However, to say that this novel is a poor imitation of every chick lit released since Bridget Jones?s Diary is putting it mildly. I like it when authors of the aforementioned genre add pizzazz and originality to an otherwise run-of-the-mill genre ? and Bailey fails to deliver just that. The novel reads like a women?s interest magazine, the dialogue is boring, the situations have a ?been there, done that? feel to them, and Maggie?s sexual exploits are unrealistic and just plain silly. And the Reality TV bit is thrown in to add something different to the rather recycled plot ? however, it fails to illustrate said originality. It?s a shame, for Bailey is a talented writer, as proven in Party Girls; she just has to find a more creative angle with her stories."
5,I love it. The best stuff out there,"I've been using this for over 5 yrs and wont try anything else. Ever since I tried other stuff, I keep coming back to this one. I also get the HOT and use it in conjunction with this one. Or the hot one in Chili is great. Im a guy so not sure of women will like it this way but i use it on my steamed veggies, meats and even sometimes eggs when I want a kick. For Split Chicken Breast with skin, I powder the top with this and a little of the Hot Version and make big slices in the meat so it can seep in. Then back for 45-50 min at 375. Good stuff!!"
4,Excellent Product,Pros: Delicious on just about everything. Seller shipped quickly.Con: Outrageous shipping costs. In order to justify it I ordered several shakers.
5,Slap Ya Mama!,I love this season! I from Texas so I prefer for my foods to be well seasoned. This season does the trick and is not too salty! Works well with just about everything. I also ordered the Hot version of this one and it works :)
5,Hot n Spicey,"I love this stuff. We use it on just about everything eggs, chicken, pork even popcorn.It even adds sizzle to vegetables. Shipped fast and on time. Product was as described."
5,Kitchen Essential,"I bought this seasoning at a New Orleans cooking school and splashed and dashed it on everything until my container went dry. I am so glad to find a source for this as I have not seen it in any of our local stores. This has just the right amount of spice to add a dash of heat and flavor, with the hot version I had to be very careful to not sprinkle too much but this version is more forgiving. It does have salt, I just add a few shakes for flavor and adjust my salt seasoning accordingly. The flavors are well balanced and give more interest than just adding red pepper or cayenne."
2,"Good flavor, but way too much salt.","I really like the flavor this gives to foods. I really like it on broiled salmon or other meaty fish. But, its just so freakin' salty. This would be great, 5 stars, if it had half as much salt. I've found its best use is on popcorn."
2,Far too salty,"By the time my salt limit has been hit, there is still barely any seasoning on my food. Also, while I understand that you're only supposed to use a little bit, it pours too quickly, and I find myself with a thick layer of salt on my food. I think I will stick to using this to marinate meat and for french fries."
5,Slap Ya Mama wakes up flavor,"Excellent seasoning for anything you want to add zest to the flavor. Makes ordinary foods receive extra taste. Highly recommend trying Slap Ya Mama seasonings - not too hot, just right..."
5,C'mon already! It's Deborah Harry!,"OK OK, so the picture on DVD is no better than the home video. And yes the cab scenes are pointless. By the way, do NY cabbies really drink beer in a bar on lunch break? But look at what you do get, the sexy, slinky Debbie Harry pulsating her way across your TV screen. If her outfit in ""Detroit 442"" doesn't drive you crazy, you must be comatose. And what about 'Denis' she hopping around in a bathing suit man! Who wouldn't want this for their home video collection.Of course the 'Rapture' video set the stage for all new wave early 80's video. Dig the man from Mars in his white ducktails and top hat.Hey the songs are great, the videos are great. Youget Union City Blues with Debbie looking like a folk singer (playing guitar too), to the farmhouse nuclear trashbag outfits in 'Atomic'. From bouncing cleavage in 'Dreaming' to the skin tight dress in 'Heart of Glass'.If you love Debbie, you got to got to got to have this."
3,Blondie classics,"While happy that the Blondie video's are available on dvd in 5.1 digital, this DVD reminds me of how far video's have come. With the exception of the later videos in Blondie's career they are mostly rough TV spots and live performances. The format of the DVD could have been done better, leave out the annoying ""artsy"" video of N.Y. city and the cab driver guy in a bar in between video's. Also, when you select to play individual video's from the main menu they are cut short by inncorrect track cuing. They play correctly when you chose the ""play all"" selection though. Bonus material is lacking, Only Island of Lost souls video and Maria from their last album, should have included Nothing is Real But the Girl video also."
3,Sweet and Low,"How wonderful that Blondie are entering the digital video era with more recent video releases like ""Maria"" and we are now able to see them along with vintage video tracks on this new DVD. How sweet it is! Although, the glaring and shameful lack of production values by their record company to release this DVD dubbed directly from a previous 1980's ""Best of Blondie"" videotape and not even attempt the release of the classic videos in their entirety is blatant disregard for the achievements of this groundbreaking and deserving band. Zero packaging excitement except for the cover photo. The first rock band to open doors in the video world to possibilities used by every artist since is slighted to the point of unforgivable with this compilation. How Low!"
2,Annoying Cabbie,"""Greatest Video Hits"" is cursed by a terribly annoying ""framing device"" wherein a nondescript New York cabbie drives around New York City and comes across various Blondie videos playing on bar TVs, TV inside limos etc. What's worse, this weak attempt to ""tie together"" the videos ends up cutting off 30 second chunks out of the beginning of several of the videos. Today, however there is a remedy, albeit an imperfect one. The CD of ""Blondie Greatest Hits: Sound & Vision"" includes a DVD which contains all but two of the videos on the ""Greatest Video Hits."" The two songs omitted are ""X Offender"" and ""(I'm Always Touched by your) Presence, Dear."" which are early gems off their first and second albums, respectively. ""Sound & Vision"" compensates by including the clever video for the equally clever ""Rapture Riders--Blondie vs. the Doors.""I give two stars, because this DVD is the only way to get the videos for ""X Offender"" and ""Presence, Dear,"" otherwise, get ""Sound & Vision"""
2,Fake 5.1 surround sound,"I agree with the other reviews here, a pretty poor effort by EMI. Beatles collectors are used to that. The video quality is shockingly bad, but watching on a 100"" screen it is really atrocious. My feeling is it was transferred from a VHS tape.My main beef, however is the 5.1 soundtrack. It is merely the stereo reprocessed into 5.1, and it is obvious. Fosgate surround decoders are far superior to what is given us here. I was really looking forwards to real surround mixes. Check out Queen's DVD, it has awesome 5.1 mixes. Also the Beatles 5.1 material on Anthology from Sgt. Pepper on are outstanding. Blondie is not some second rate group, they deserve better than this.Please, EMI give us a REAL DVD of Blondie's videos!!!"
2,Great idea but low creativity,"The DVD release of Blondie videos is anti-climatic affair in itself and unfortunately it is not like the comprehensive ""Complete Picture"" which includes Deborah Harry's solo work as well. If that gets a DVD release, then the world of Blondie is truly justified for the new century. Seek the later compilation instead. Heads should roll in EMI for this travesty!"
4,Unoriginal Source,"This collection was taken from the re-editied version of the best of blondie video in 1984, Originally released in 1981. The audio was re-edited for whatever reason and is apparent on the video for heart of glass. Most of the videos are very rare and visually stunning. This collection also includes rare bonus videos of The hardest part and Island of Lost SOuls in their full legth versions."
2,So-So DVD collection for Blondie fans,"I have worshipped Deborah Harry through many career highs & lows & highs again... Such a band as great & influential to video & pop culture as Blondie DESERVE more than this RUSH JOB of a ""best of videos"" DVD. Most of all, the fans deserve more!!!!Grateful to have it, but not thrilled.Pat Benatar, Devo, etc. offered loads of extras and ALL of their videos on their DVDs... this release is merely a REHASH of an old VHS collectionwith a few so called ""extras"". Hopefully this means it is NOT the last release---Fans deserve ALL videos (complete & re-mastered,with band commentaries) and tons of rare stuff... If lazy, greedy record industry types had to rehash an old release, it should have been the British """"complete Picture"" video collection. Maybe RHINO could release ETTB AND a true best of DVD. oh yeah... including the great ""Good Boys"" video from this years' ""Curse"" CD."
2,You Fools!,"All of you supposed Blondie fans should recognize that these videos are culled from the same material as the Best of Blondie VHS and Eat to the Beat VHS. Most come from the former, and both videos are out of print. Do yourself a favor, and scour mom & pop video stores for these or buy them on ebay. You people have a lot of nerve for criticizing Blondie's supposed lack of innovation in video when they were the first to make an entire video album: Eat to the Beat! Take a look at the bulk of those videos, and you'll find some of the most insane, lovable, and completely punk rock people to ever become pop legends. Get the Eat to the Beat video and Blondie will redefine themselves for you."
3,EMI did not take advantage of DVD technology,"EMI are hopeless at utitising DVD technology. This DVD release reminds me of Tina Turner's ""Simply the Best"" DVD. Just a straight copy of a previous video release, but with a pseudo 5.1 mix thrown in.Ok, I don't own any Blondie videos, so I was grateful to have them on one DVD. However, the picture quality is not any better than a video. I guess that has to be expected since the original videos were filmed with video camera.Why didn't EMI do a better job? For example, they could have got rid of the annoying cab scenes between each video (just another example of their straight copy from the video ""Best of Blondie""). Why not go the extra mile EMI and add the Debbie Harry solo videos. There is so much room on a DVD to allow for this.Shame on EMI for releasing yet another shoddy music DVD. You don't deserve the business that us consumers give you."
3,It is good for kids,This is a good gamepad for someone who is not a heavy player. It plays well for short term usage but buttons will stick for long play. For the money if you have kids this is the one to buy because controller come and go and you won't feel bad when it is time to get another one.
2,Good but not Great,"I'm not the biggest country music fan, but I do like a lot of the work Alan Jackson has done. Until now that is. I'm surprised and disappointed he would capitalize on 9/11. Pretty shallow and disappointing."
3,A great singer loses respect,"After 9/11 people wondered how long it would take a celebrity to ""pay tribute"" aka immortalize the event in song. ""Where Were You When The World Stopped Turning"" is probably the most unfortunate of these musical cash registers, and unfortunately the C&W establishment buys into it and showers awards on this shameless profit off the tragedy of others. I am terribly disappointed in Alan Jackson, and this ruins the album for me. The tunes aren't even good; they're just smarmy. Enjoy the blood money."
4,"Yeah, it's a new album","Once again, Alan have diditI ' ve bought every album before this and when I listen too the the new album I'm been very happy, Alan have done it with success again.I will recomended this album to every person who love country music."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Alan Jackson has done it again, another brilliant CD. I've listened to Drive over and over and can not get enough of it. The song ""Where Were You"" ALWAYS brings tears to my eyes. I LOVE this CD and recommend it to everyone, country fan or not!!!!"
5,Alan still has it!,"Once again Alan has blessed us with his clever lyric and heart felt feelings....From Drive to Where were you..this CD is a keeper!I also suggest buying his ""Under the Influence"" CD."
5,Top Top Album,"This is one of Alan's best work, every one of these songs is great you usually buy a cd and a few are ordinary but not this one its all good"
3,It's okay,"It's okay for the price. Not that great though.I am not an expert. However, I play intensively.I don't like the string that this racket has.Also, after using it for a month or so, I have found cracks at the joint between round part and holder. I had bought two rackets. One racket has string broken already in less than 2 months.anyway, it's pretty light one, but not good for heavy use."
1,GARBAGE,"This racket fell apart within five minutes! The grip tape unravelled and the cone shaped piece that goes from grip to neck came loose, sliding up and down.. but the worst part is that the strings are so weak that the shuttlecock gets stuck between them instead of bouncing off. This happened to not just one but FOUR of these before we had a chance to even warm up! PASS ON THIS BRAND!"
2,Not Recommended,"I purchased 2 of these about 3 months ago and play about once every week or two. To start, the grip is pretty terrible. It's slippery and has no durability. The string was the second problem. I broke both of them within two weeks of each other on overhead smashes. I would recommend buying a racquet that is priced slightly higher because you will have to replace this one eventually anyways. You are better off spending a little bit more in the first place."
3,Strings broke in less than a month!,"I'm on the badminton team in my high school, and I go to practice for about 2-3 hours 6 times in a week. It was doing pretty good for me at first, (since I'm a beginner) but then one of the players in varsity needed to borrow my racket, since he forgot his at home, and after using my racket for only about 5 minutes, the strings already ""popped""! I guess this racket can be good for beginners, but when it comes to hardcore, experienced, intensive players, the strings on the racket will surely break probably in a week or two!"
3,Racket OK for average use.,"This is typical of most badminton rackets available,just OK for backyard use but don't expect it to last a long time."
4,Good but not great,"I bought these for our school and they were okay but not great. The kids banged them up pretty good. The strings broke and heads were bent within a month. But for the price, we got our money's worth. I was looking for something a little tougher that would last a bit longer than 1 month."
1,Wish I Could Rate This With Less Stars,"This one is worse than Vol. I (unfortunately, I bought Vol. 1 & 2 simultaneously - so, I've been double-suckered!)The accents are HORRIBLE & the monologues are vapid wastes of paper. How does this crap get published???"
2,Too much like cheap diner glassware,"I didn't like these. They are very utilitarian looking, like cheap diner glasses. Very thick glass -- they probably will never break, so they have that going for them -- but they are not very attractive. They also seem too tall. The bottom half is quite narrow, so to get them to hold 16 oz, they are pretty tall."
4,10 are Excellent but 2 are defective,One glass has an unfinished surface on the bottom ot the glass. It's sharp and thick. I thought it was a melted ice that was stucked on the bottom. The other one has a cracked on the edge. Both are useable but it's kind of strange to drink from these 2 glasses
2,bulky and heavy,"As soon as I got this, I had to return. My main reason is the glass is too heavy and somehow I felt it was too thick and not sophisticated."
1,BEWARE OF AMAZON PROCESSING,"The product description tells you that you are buying a ""Box of 12."" What arrives is a box of one. One glass, wrapped in bubble wrap, with a packing slip that says you are receiving your order for $46.43. I returned the one glass, but will not trust Amazon to process the order again. Re-wrapping, processing the return and driving to UPS, all to return one glass that pretends to be a box of 12. Buy your box of 12 somewhere else."
2,11 Glasses - NOT 12,"Surprised when I opened the box to find only 11 glasses, NOT 12. The glasses are good quality.....just need one more in the box or change the product description to read 11."
5,Beautiful glasses!!!,I just love these glasses and the price is lovely! I had to get another set due to glasses being broken. The 2nd set had broken glasses even when shipped UPS. That is the only negative thing I have to say.
1,Not what I ordered.,"The puppet in the photo is not what I received. I received a ""pig head"" puppet. It was ok quality, but too large for a child's hand. Also, the point is that it was NOT AT ALL what I ordered."
2,Not too helpful,"If you really are just starting out and have no clue what you're doing then this book might be helpful. Might. For me, most of the book was too vague to be useful. Comments to the effect of ""choose the best possible system [or arrangement] for X"" drove me crazy. What, in his opinion, is the best system, and why? Also, the sentences were so short and basic that I felt like I was in grammar school. This book might serve as a useful checklist for things to think about, but I didn't find many answers or very good advice. Skim it at the library."
5,"Very good book , but for advanced developers.",Dynamic Html Unleashed is a once of great DHTML books. But this is clearly not a introduction book. You should have a good HTML and javascript knowladge .
2,"Good points, but far more bad points","Although this box does cover everything, and is one of the few books to tackle scripting for both Netscape and Microsoft v4 browsers, it has so many oversights, errors and omissions, you'll spend more time working out what is the truth than actually learning stuff."
2,Very misleading and confusing,"I'm sure all the information is in this book, but it is so poorly organized that trying to read it is unreasonably difficult. It seems that every chapter was written by a different author and very little was done to coordinate the flow of the book. Throughout the book the authors talk about making scripting for both NS and MSIE but very little attention is paid to teaching you how to write for BOTH platforms. Again, the information is there but you need to work awfully hard to find it."
2,Comprehensive but needs a reference guide,"The book appears very comprehensive, but really needs a quick reference guide on all the elements of dynamic HTML (including scripts and HTML itself)."
1,What are you guys talking about?,"I sincerely believe in other reviews before getting this cd, and was totally disappointed.The music is boooooooring and is just a geeky mix of old records, but that's all. Doesn't move me."
2,Didn't help with my 2007 Pilot check engine light,Bought this to resolve my never-ending check engine light on my 2007 honda pilot. It worked for about a month ... then the light came back. I give up ... I'm heading to the dealer to get one of their million-dollar caps. ugh.
2,barstools,Ordered two. Both have huge cracks in wood. They dont look that nice with the cracks all over. Wish I could of seen before I bought them.
4,Really Good Book!!!,"I liked this boo[k], it had alot of intresting things. I loved that game that herinteractive made based on this book. I think that if you like nancy drew books this is a really good one to read."
4,Yet another tense escape from Raccoon City.,"Raccoon City has fallen to the T-Virus and former STARS (Special Tactics And Rescue Squad) member Jill Valentine is trying to get out alive and uninfected. The Umbrella Corporation has other plans...This novelization of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis follows the game narrative quite well and S.D. Perry fleshes out the character backgrounds/motivations nicely. It is not the experience of the game, but it is a fun read. Recommended."
4,Very scary. Well written!!!!,"This book takes place at the same time as Resident Evil part 2 or ""The City of the Dead"". In this book you follow Jill Valentine on a different side of Raccoon City. But she has more troubles than Chris and Claire. She is being chased by the Nemisis, or the STARS eater. Throughout this book you will find yourself looking around the corners in your own house and praying to god that a huge half dead thing isnt going to jump through your wall. This is a good book."
4,Very Good,"i think that no one could have done it better, s d perry has once again shown how she can novelise games with ease and accuracycongratulations, i am about to begin reading code veronica, and cannot wait for another resident evil original!..."
4,Good details and Explains things game didnt...,"This was the first of the Resident evil books i read. Since I played the game first, this book explained many things that the game didnt. Really realistic based on the game. Gives Jill a better character and Carlos the same character as the game but with more atitude. Not a really scary book but good storyline and details. For those who like the game Nemesis, this is the book for you."
4,This isn't S.D Perry's best work I hope,I like the book but S.D Perry didn't really describe the envierment of where Jill is. And Brad is to far up in the book.But over the book is good.
2,"Scary, but not in the true RE sense","This is one of the most horrible books i have ever read. I could barely force myself to read the book, the whole way through.You can tell a book/game cross-over is goin to be bad when you can practically use it as a walkthrough for the game.I started the book expecting an average book, that in some scenes would scare me and send shivers down my spine, making you feel like you were actually in racoon city, but even in the most action-filed scenes of the book, the author (S.D Perry) would not commit to adding some originality to the book by changing the plot from the game to suit the book.In the end i felt that my time has been abused by an unoriginal, uninspiring novel that has put me off S.D Perrys Resident Evil novels forever. S.D Perry i want the time i spent reading this book back. PEC rule."
4,Book condition,Book was in good condition as stated in listing. Price was equal to quality of book condition. Very satisfied.
4,Great story,"Im a fast reader and i have read a lot of books but this one was great because it had a lot of accion and horror. The story is not your tipical horror terror book, its actually very short, it has good characters, lots of monsters and a great plot. Im almost finished with the novel and i can tell you its worth the money you spend on it.When i say its not your tipical horror book i mean that it cant be compeared to such books because the writers have you perplexed and she has her style that explains every thing bit by bit anyway its just a story taken out of a video game how good could it get if u played the game? but if u like to read something fast,inresting and most of all ure a die hard fan of resident evil than buy this book u wont be unsatisfied."
3,"Another ""Resident Evil"" book (sigh)","I will start off by stating that this is the best book of the series, but thats not saying much. If you have played the games, you might enjoy this expose into the world of survival horror based entirely on your love of the video game. However, if you have not played the game, or are looking for a well-crafted novel, you will be disapointed. Again, Perry fails at bringing to life the dark, terryfing, and threatening aspects of the enviroment. She relies too much on the fact that you have already educated yourself on the RE story through the games, and offers little imagination beyond what the games have already established. You are left with little feelings for the characters, and you rarely get the ""feeling"" of the atmosphere they are in. Mostly lifeless and too much like the game (thus repetitive), it still offers some extra insight on the characters, but, unfortunatly, not the monsters."
4,"Very cool, but contradicting","This was a very good book that explained many things that the game didn't. The overall story was very good but it didn't give you the fear of the Nemesis that the game definitely did. One more thing, at the beginning of City Of The Dead(Book 3) Jill leaves Raccoon City with Chris. She LEAVES! Then why is she stil in Raccoon at the beginning of Nemesis the book? Oh well, it doesnt ruin the book at all, but it distracted me while I read it. Or maybe I'm not understanding something, which if you do please email me at bill200je@aol.com. Despite all that crap, the book is still great. Another good job."
5,Resident Evil 5 Nemisis,"This book is Awsome. There is soooooooooooo much action. It is one of the best books around. You have to read the first four first though, which have tons of action as well, and are definitley worth reading. Start your collection NOW! Trust me, if you like the game and love action, GET THIS BOOK. Hope you make the right choice. Bye!"
1,why not buy generation girl barbies.,the generation girl barbie is a very boring doll. her hair gets messed up as soon as you take her out of the box.(even with all the care in the world). i'm 10 years old and my dream was to have a generation girl barbie. i saved my lunch money for months to get that doll! i'm totaly dissapointed!in my oppinion that doll is not worth 1 cent of what you pay to have her!
3,Barbie rules . . .so do all Generation girls!!!,"I've loved Barbies all my life . . .since I got my first one at the age of two!!! Barbie was always cool with me, and now she is a big part in any little girl's life. She has so many friends and family now!!! I love the Generation girl Barbie, but I still like the others. My personal favorite Generation girl is the surfer girl Tori, )I think) Well ,byes!!!"
4,This toy is cute and is a bit like a real baby.,"Baby Dill is water-proof and can be dangerous for babies but over all he is safe. He has a hard head and a soft body. He wears shorts (which can't be taken off) and has a cute gown. He floats and encourages chidren to bath. I mean if Baby Dill can bath, why can't I?"
1,Another boring release,Kataklysm never was anything special. I can not support this band in any way.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
4,Another solid effort from Kataklysm,"Upon my initial listening of this album, my reaction was along the lines of ""ehhh..it's ok but it's nothing new"". After a few more listens, this album has really grown on my. Sure, Kataklysm isn't the most inovative band out there and this album pretty much follows the same formula as their last few albums but it's done well. Despite my dislike for Kittie, the track It Turns To Rust with guest vocals by someone from Kittie is probably my favorite on this disc.If you've liked the last couple of Kataklysm albums then chances are you'll like this."
2,,"I've never been much of a Kataklysm fan, and this record does not change my opinion about them. While the record's well played, richly produced, and has its few moments every now and then, it doesn't give me the stimulus to want to play it over and over again. The album mostly consists of mid-tempo, groovy, death metal, sometimes with a lot of melody, which remind of the Swedish Melodic bands. There's very little speed or aggression, the last track tries so hard to sound like Hypocrisy and there's even hints of metalcore on some areas of the record. The song ""It turns to Rust"" features Kittie's singer Morgan Lander and man, can she screams her balls off! Unfortunately, it's one of the few areas in which this record tends to sound extreme."
4,Blistering and Brutal...beauty in darkness,"not much to say here, other than the title of this review. i had never really listened to kataklysm before this release, i definitely will now. if this isn't their best release then i'm going to start picking my way through each and every one to find it. the only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is b/c this album does sometimes get lost in the repetiveness of modern brutallica metal, but it doesn't stray for long. i suggest this album. will stand up as one of the best albums of 2006 when all is said and done. so far i would have to say it is #2, only second to in flames, and right in line w/ himsa and bleeding through, but many more albums to come, and i can't wait!!! 2006, time to ride the spiral..."
2,They lost it,"zzzzzzzzzz.......oh sorry, this album is putting me to sleep. Everything cheesey they've done in the past has been rolled up into one neat, tight package. This has got to be one of the most boring albums I have ever got. Its all cut and paste and devoid of atmosphere or life. Ok, so you have jackhammer stop and go drums, insane technical guitar solos, and deep, throaty growls. But so did Suffocation, and there new album is a million times better then this.Overall, people new to the death metal scene, or those who avoid death metal's golden past will love this. Everyone else, will not.Avoid."
5,Kataklysm have become the greatest Canadian Death Metal band!,"While other Death Metal bands have stuck to formulaic gore lyrics and the same technical guitar sounds and growling, Kataklysm has managed to escape the cliche while continuing to produce heavy Death Metal that will satisfy any fan of the genre. Anyone who is a fan of At The Gates, Vader, or Morbid Angel will love this band. It will also appeal to fans of the heavier type of Melodic Death Metal (a.k.a. Dark Tranquillity, Nightrage, or Callenish Circle), as there are more melodic parts to this CD. Bottom line, this is band you must check out if you like any of these bands, and is worth a listen if you like any extreme heavy metal. These Canadians never seem to put out dissapointing releases, check out ""Shadows and Dust"" by them as well."
3,Works with the Tenba Messenger Bag also,I have this attached to my Tenba Messenger bag and it works.There are two little side flaps that I think is more designed for attaching to the backpack. The side flaps kind of stick out when attached to the messenger bag so it doesn't look 100% a custom fit. But the attachment is pretty secure and it has not problem holding the weight of a 16-24 ounce water bottle.
2,Not as expected,"I was very impressed by the timely shipping of this item. Unfortunately I received the item DAMAGED and the tag was taped to it, which is extremely disappointing. I was expecting a new product. Furthermore, I was expecting it to be different. My mistake, but I thought this item had 3 levels. It sells as just one; you have to buy each stacking basket individually. That would've been nice to know from the beginning, I would have been able to order the appropriate amount. The specific dimensions of this product are: 12 in W x 7 in H x 10 in D"
2,Cheap plastic,"It's a bummer that the plastic isn't flat on the bottom. Everything rolls into the center, making it hard to organize anything (like toiletries) inside."
4,Good product but WARNING,Just a small warning if you are planing to buy this product.From some [...].This product is intended for the Pioneer 103 DVR that burn to DVD-R/RW burner only. Not the HP one.Note the +RW for HP and -R/RW for Pioneer.Apart from this it's a good product.
1,Only burns at 1x on Pioneer 103 drive,Though my Pioneer drive is spec'd for 2x DVD-R and other medialike Verbatim does burn at 2x. The Pioneer 103 will only let me burn this Memorex stuff at 1x. Someone tells me Memorex and Pioneer are in a brawl over something so this was Pioneers answer to getting even. Screw the consumer. Definitely Buyer Beware.Not as advertised and I've got a ton of them to return.
1,demon sex,same crap as demon seduction and they both suck its main hook is that these chicks are horny as hell and blood is the only thing that gets them off (sounds good I know but its isn't) so the best part of the movie is this shot of a brunet chick dancing nakie while buckets of blood are thrown on her and she rubs it in kinda hot but only last for few seconds and not really worth sitting through the stupid alien story line
3,Does NOT have a shank,"Good wheel, but contrary to the description, it does not come with a shank, hex or otherwise. Also, the wire is brass-plated steel, not brass as claimed in the Amazon listing."
2,"Charger doesn't fit the Zire 31, either","The USB sync cable does fit my Zire 31, and luckily that's the primary reason I bought this kit. The charging cable definitely doesn't fit the little hole on the Zire 31, though. So at this point (based on the earlier reviews) I'm wondering which, if any, of the Zire models this kit was intended for -- just the basic Zire 21 (or whatever the model number for the B&W version is)?"
1,Didn't know it was no good for Zire 71,I didn't see anything about not being compatible with Zire 71 when I purchased this. I will be returning it.
1,poor explanation of product,I purchase the Zire by Palm Amason recommended the hotzinc and charging kit. This was an unnecessary purchase the Zire comes with both other then some specific attachments the average individual will never use. I am returning the product.
1,Zire 71,"I also purchased this product without reading the reviews. Oh soooo misleading, now I am leaving on a 2 week trip with no charger!!! Very, Very poor item description."
4,The next big thing?,"i bought this after hearing ""tired of being sorry"" and a few other songs on their web site (ringsideband.com). the cd is very good. this album stands out against the bland backdrop of pop music today. there's plenty of pop on this album, but there's enough electronic instruments and guitars to give the entire sound a raw edge.the buzz is building on this odd band (one member is teen actor balthazar getty). go out and get the cd and hear what the buzz is about."
2,"A few good songs, overall unimaginative","""Strangerman"" is the hook that got me into listening to this album. It is a good song, but the rest of the album sounds just like it. If you like listening to the same type of song over and over again, you might like this.Matt Zarnstorff"
4,dark but fun,"Hey these guys are good! check out the lyrics as well as the sound! The lead singer has the kind of raspy voiced sound that makes you want to close your eyes and dream of long hot summer nights spent in an exotic and intoxicating location. I hope Ringside is going places...I also hope other's listen and like it as much as I did. Having said that, there are one or two songs that just don't seem to fit on this CD...but overall this band is fantastic and fun to listen to."
5,Item is exactly what I expected!!,"I really like this CD - hope this band releases more music!! The singer sounds a little bit like ""E"" of Eels."
3,Great jams,"I like 4-5 songs on here. I love the singers voice. I wish they made other albums. Wished the song, ""tired of being sorry"" got into mainstream popularity."
3,Buy it used.,"""TIred of Being Sorry"" is a fantastic song. This album is really ""hit-or-miss"" for me.Get it used!"
3,Nice soundscape,"I bought this CD for three specific tracks, and they did not disappoint. Some of this CD was a bit of a disappointment, but all in all, the good tracks really make up for it (The 3 Ambrosia songs are well worth it)."
3,Solid book on the big champs of Boxing,"Solid book with some somewhat interesting brief bios on the big champs, although it's little more than a bit of flavoring to get you interested on them. Nothing really new is learned here."
4,I thought it was going to be heavier.,"I wished it put the weight/sized in the description. I was disappointing how light it was because my chops were already bad from the start, but they aren't horrible sticks, just lighter than expected."
4,good beanie,"this is an excellent beanie, fits me well (and my head isn't that small). totally recommend."
2,Shameless Therapy Promotion,"While some good content available from any anxiety book or website, this book is based on the promotion of life-long therapy. I found no tools I could use on my own, but rather the sob stories of unfortunate individuals. Hopefully more educated individuals can harvest the useful content from the ""business"" of funneling into the Chaange program which the author shamelessly promotes."
2,BORING,"THIS BOOK IS SO LONG, SO BORINNG AND SO COMPLICATED!!! IT COULD NOT KEEP MY ATTENSION ON IT.I GAVE IT AWAY!!!! I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING FORCED TO READ A TEXT BOOK FOR GRADUATE UNIVERSITY CLASSES. IF YOU ARE A SCHOLAR, THAN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU FOR SURE!!!!"
3,Too Hot,"I bought mine at a second hand store. Was searching online for a solution & thought I might as well share my experience here. The pot looked new and I love percolated coffee. I own two 10 cup Pyrex electrics and two clear glass stove top percolators. All of them make a smooth, rich cup of coffee. The electrics are a lot easier to manage.My Cuisinart 4 cup heats the coffee too much during percolation, and that causes the coffee to be bitter. I can see the water frothing in the little plastic sight glass. Preserved Killick survived storm and battle, but nearly lost his life at the hands of Captain Jack Aubrey because he boiled the coffee. I agree with the good Captain and humbly disagree with Louis L'Amour's cowboys. Boiling a pot of coffee is a crime. Can the temperature can be adjusted on this machine?On the plus side, the PRC-4 is easy to set up, makes the coffee quickly and easy to clean. If I could just cool it down a bit."
1,Zero stars!!!,"My base fell off, too, many months ago. I tried gluing mine back on too just to wind up with glue all over the base. I think the only reason my plastic bubble is still intact is that my experience with plastic tops on percolators gave me the knowledge not to pull it without adding leverage by lifting the side at the same time.I loved it so much, I stuck it in a closet hoping to replace it some day and using the old one for spare parts, but after reading these other posts, I'll try the 4 cup Farberware instead and chalk this up as yet another cheaply-made, overpriced, modern-day Cuisinart product."
5,"Good Coffee-Quick Coffee,","Makes Good coffee.Makes Good coffee Quick.That's all I need.Very Happy.BUT,My cat knocked my PRC-4 off the shelf.Fell about 5 feet to the floor.Still made quick coffee, but very weak.Ordered another one from Amazon.Number 2 made coffee quick,but too weak to drink.Same coffee,Same bottled water,Same amount of water and coffee.Doesn't seem to percolate long enough.Now have about a hundred dollars of watering pots."
1,Worst Fountain Pen I've Ever Owned,"I own cheap pens, expensive pens, antique pens, new pens, and this Waterford Claria pen is the worst I've ever owned. It simply will not write, which--I believe--is the main purpose of a pen. My wife gave this to me as a gift. She did not buy the pen from Amazon (I wish she had;she'd probably have gotten her money back and spent it on a better pen)and the company she did buy it from refused to help her. I e-mailed Waterford, and they never responded.I will never buy any Waterford product."
1,NOT SOFT!!! NOT What I expected,I have always had Egyptian cotton sheets for as long as i can remember. These sheets are terrible. NOT SOFT and always look wrinkled. I just purchased another set from Dillards and they are only 500 thread count and much softer and half the price.
3,Not Bad... Just Different,"OK let me start by saying that every band that has been able to endure for many years has had to change their style to maintain interest. The Beatles did it, Queen did it, and now Apop's doing it. I respect that.That being said, I think the album is enjoyable, but not anything special. The first three songs are top notch and I'm warming up to the others, but the whole disc suffers from poor lyrical content. Remember Burnin' Heretic, or Mourn? Those had great melodies AND good lyrics, but I'm sad to say that this album doesn't measure up in that respect.However, most of the tracks are catchy and danceaable. If you're looking for a nice fun electronica album to dance to, go ahead and pick this up. You probably won't be dissapointed."
3,"Good Live, but...","This past saturday, I had the good fortune to attend an APop show. The tracks off of 'Harmonizer' sounded much, much better live than in studio. They played a fair selection off of this album. Here's the kicker: when something off of 'Harmonizer' fired up (with the exception of 'Until the End of the World'), the crowd went mild... the best example of this was when they fired up 'Ok Amp, let me out'... the crowd reacted, but.... They blew up at 'Starsign'.... I gues the styles really do make a difference....The album is a strong flavour of vanilla."
5,Absolutely Excellent,"What a wonderful CD. If you like APB, this is definitely a no question buy. Even if you didn't like some of APB's earlier stuff, this album holds a new concept of their synthpop/industrial combination. Every song on it is unique, but not too unique that it breaks the momentum of the CD. You can really tell the personality of APB from the artwork on the CD, the names of the songs, and the different songs themselves. Isn't that what music is about? Expression? This CD does a wonderful job of expressing what APB has wanted to express. I'm extremely happy with the purchase. So if you liked any of APB's earlier work, be sure to grab this. Even if you didn't like much of APB, this CD is a sure win if you're a fan of industrial/electronic music. Happy buying. (don't forget to check out Future Perfect either :) )"
3,Not Apoptygma Berzerk's best effort,"Since Apoptygma Berzerk has become big in the Industrial/EBM scene, I'm sure that most fans were looking forward to something spectacular in Harmonizer. Unfortunately, for me it was a bit of a disappointment. The first 3 tracks (Suffer In Silence, Unicorn and Until The End Of The World) are all pretty good, but the rest of the CD seems like hollow filler. The only other song worth mentioning in my opinion is Spindizzy. I still believe 7 is Apoptygma Berzerk's best album overall, as almost every track is listenable to the very end. I think Harmonizer could have been great if only Stephan Groth spent a little more time conjuring up some more quality tracks (we all know he's capable of it). As for long time Apop fans, there's still something in Harmonizer for you, just be aware that not every track in it is a club hit."
2,Not their best,"The only track I liked from this album was 'Until the End of the World'. The rest of the album felt like musical mish-mosh and poorly thought out. Sloppy and not like APB used to be at all.I agree with a few other reviewers who said that their older albums are better. My faves are 7 and Welcome to Earth. Those have some really good, danceable synthpop.I would personally skip Harmonizer and hope that their next album would have effort put into it, and not just some effort put into one or two songs."
2,Mediocre,"I just started listening to this album ... and I am not impressed. After listening to an album like Welcome to Earth, Harmonizer is a major downfall, in my opinion. Perhaps if I listen to Harmonizer more, then it will grow on me, but I doubt it. A biggie: I don't think APB should have attempted the lengthy songs just yet. It doesn't match with their style or what I thought of them to be, so I am a little annoyed that they are not as good as I normally think them to be. You might still enjoy the music even if I don't; however, I would suggest downloading some of their songs from somewhere first and listening to a couple before going out and buying the CD. I hope it proves to be more impressive to you than to me."
2,"eh,,,","Well, all I can really say about this album is I'm glad I didnt pay for it. My friend gave me a burned copy... I'd hear some of apb's stuff a long time ago... but I remember it being somewhat industrial. this... I dont even know. I mean, there's a few good songs. but overall its just lots of fairly uniform sounds repeating fairly quickly for an entire track... there's no real depth to most of the songs. if you can even call them that... bah. disappointment."
4,Definitely Original,"APB's previous album Welcome To Earth took a step into a more synth pop sound, adding their electro and EBM flavor to the mix. Their new album Harmonizer goes back a bit and when I listen to it, I'd think it would have come out between 7 and Welcome To Earth, because it sounds like a blend of those two albums. The intro song is definitely an awesome EBM dancefloor hit, reminding me of the power ""Starsign"" had with it's catchy chorus and hardhitting sounds. The slow intro is like an engine revving until it's fully ignited. There's more dance and EBM songs that are catchy as well. But some tracks seem lost and don't really go anywhere. APB definitely has their own style of music and layering, but some of it I just don't get. Overall, this album is definitely worth getting for EBM fans and for those who love Stephan's lyrics that come from the heart."
1,Abomination.,"Having followed Apop since the glory days of ""Bitch"" and ""Deep Red,"" I loathe this album. Inspired by the popularity of ""Kathy's Song,"" Groth has essentially stretched its flavor out for a whole album, attempting to appeal to ravers and goths alike. It's an admirable goal, admittedly, except that it's horrible. Attempting to straddle two fairly well-established genres, the lyrics come across as the puerile whining of a preadolescent bedecked in his mother's mascara layered over generic trance programming more at home... well, nowhere. This album doesn't deserve a home. Skip it and, as the song says, let it suffer in silence. Don't waste your money."
4,"new album, new attitude.","Is this the evolution of Apoptygma Berzerk? I had been listening to Welcome to Earth for awhile, so I was a bit confused when I first heard Harmonizer. It takes a much different path than WTE. While the songs on WTE were incredibly original, innovative, and greatly differed from each other, the songs on Harmonizer blend together making the album too repetitive. Don't get me wrong, this CD kicks..., but it's not nearly as good as WTE or 7. The songs are optimistic, and have beautiful chorus's that will get stuck in your head all day long at work. Try out ""Suffer in Silence"" of ""Until the End of The World."" Classic Berzerk stuff. And one more thing- what's up with the fonts and design of the cover and back of the CD case? I can somewhat read the song titles, but the tiny print is just unreadable. There's a song on this album called ""Photoshop Sucks,"" well, maybe he used Adobe Photoshop to design the thing. The final verdict: yeah, buy it."
2,Overrated and Overpriced,"This album is pretty disappointing. When you get past the first three tracks (of which ""Suffer in Silence"" is the only outstanding one) the rest of the album is unfortunately quite [bad]. Songs like ""Pikachu"" have minimal content to them (what ... were they thinking?) and the others are just boring. They're not danceable, they're not ambient enough to be thought-provoking, and they're not exciting enough to even be considered for radio play. An album most APB fans could and should go without, there is no way to justify paying list price for this piece of shiny plastic."
2,Disappointing,"Following on the success of Apop's surprising 2000 effort, Welcome to Earth, I find Harmonizer to disappointing. The band is definitely following the musical structures established with Welcome to Earth and has become distinctively more pop-friendly. There are some enjoyable beats and catchy tunes, but the album finds failure both lyrically and vocally. Welsome to Earth seemed capable of hiding these weakness amongst strong song structures and effects, however, within Harmonizer, the lyrics and vocals become too dominant and become a weakness because their not nearly as strong as other artists in the genre.Welcome to Earth had me enthusiastic for this release, but after several listens, it just doesn't measure up to it. Perhaps things would have been stronger if Apop had taken things a little further as opposed to building on themes already laid down in their prior work."
4,worthy but not mr.bungle,"deadfood does not sounf anything like Mr. Bungle, yea i can point out that DEADFOOOD is definitly influenced by Bungle, but DEADFOOD have earned and mutated their own sound, into what one might call spazzed out infantile bursts of short attenton span music. but it is a refreshing change from the typical schlock you hear on the radio"
5,Cabbage,"the sun was shining down, and this glorious noise did make me smile. o glorious noise, how do'st thou make me smil so? and then we fell in love, below that lovely sun, and we did share a lovely love. a lovely love, a shining sun, a glorious noise. a shining sun, a glorious noise, a lovely love, and dead food. o, the dead food. o how it smelled."
1,Spend your money elsewhere,The knife comes with a cheap plastic grip with a skull and flames on it(not a wooden handle as seen in the picture). The blade is very poorly made other than to sit in a closet this knife serve no purpose.
3,"Good looking knife, but not the 1 I ordered.","They sent me a wrong one, this one has a nice wooden handle, they sent me one with a crappy looking one that's a yellowish color and looks retarded as hell. Don't buy horrible color, it's not what is shown in the picture.. it's a different color. Other than that it's great, my mom took it away cause she said it was dangerous hanging against the wall.. with the sheath on >:("
3,MEH,"The best way to describe this is so-so. The brass knuckles are a nice addition, but the entire package looks a little too tacky. The blade is not balanced and rather dull right out of the box.You get what you pay for i guess."
4,"Great looking knife, good price for the quality","Hey, I bought this knife about 1 1/2 years back. The blade may need shapening, as mine was pretty dull out of the box. I didnt plan on using this knife for heavy use. But for what i use it for it stands up well. Im a collector and mainly get for expensive knives (Boker, Ka-bar, spiderco ect) so I cant really compare this to them for obvious reasons. This knife looks very nice and mean. The sheath that it came with is OK, it does what its meant to do. If you got a couple of bucks and dont mind that its not a big brand knife, then I would reccomend you getting this."
1,"WRONG ITEM, CHEAPLY MADE","The packaging was not very good. The box for the knife was broken and torn and the knife was only covered with a very thin piece of plastic- which protected it ZERO. Not only that, but the knife was NOT ANYTHING like pictured. I ordered it in the false idea that it would come with a wood grain look- as to much of my surprise, I opened it and this was NOT the case. The knife I received had red flames and a skull on it and was VERY cheaply made. It was crappy hard plastic and a piece of it was even broken off! When I tried to begin my return process, I couldnt do that either because you have to call for that item- which of course, is inconvenient! I wish I would have NEVER purchased this!!!!"
2,Ok knife for price,"It's no where compared to the high quality knives like kabar, it has a extremely dull blade and I sharpened it. Good to show but not on field."
4,nice knife,while the knife itself is quite sturdy and able to take ware and tare the sheath included was not the one pictured.
3,pretty good,The thing I didn't like about the knife was the handle has a cheap plastic grip screwed onto it. Other than that I like it. It doesn't seem heavy duty but it's still pretty sharp. It should get the job done and for 10 bucks it's not bad to have.
5,Heavy Duty Knife,"Gave as a gift at Christmas, and he loved it. Looks exactly like picture. It's a pretty big knife. Perfect for a knife collector!"
3,"Great as a knife, but not as advertised.","This knife is pretty awesome and fits very well in my hand. I love the way it looks and has a sleek design. However, this knife is not made out of Stainless Steel as advertised. The easiest way to tell whether is or not is to put it up to a magnet and if the magnet clings to the knife then it is not made out of Stainless Steel. This made sharpening the knife tedious because the shavings would cling to the edge of the blade where is just sharpened it so i would have to continuously wipe it off while sharpening the knife. Still worth the $12, but if you are looking for a stainless steel knife, this is not the one to get."
4,Ok knife,When I got this knife it was good for the price but the blade moves from side to side and the handle is fake wood
5,Ready for the zombies!,"This item is sent ""dull"", but the local Basspro store sharpened it for free. The knife feels good in the hand and just write- PERFECT for the zombie apocolypse that is coming :)"
2,Didn't get my first one!,I ordered this knife and didn't receive it so I ordered another...when I got it the blade was cool but the handle was a plastic...ok knife overall
4,AWESOME,This knife is by far the most amazing knife ever. The looks are amazing and everything is sturdy. The only thing about this knife is that it isn't super sharp.
5,awesome,"This is amazing i dont know what some people talk about, its sheath has a hard plastic on the inside, it is a little lose in the sheith and its not anything to worry about. It came sharp And well built, good buy."
2,Knife,"I just started collecting knives and this was one of the first ones I got. As the other ones started coming in I realized how bad this one really is, then again it's one of the cheapest. I'll end up keeping it, but wouldn't recommend it."
1,NO!,If you want a good knife you should really buy American this starts sharp but dulls incredibly fast id say save up and buy a quality knife... not this
1,Not up to my expectations,"I expected this knife to be sturdy after reading reviews. I was greatly disappointed. First the blade is light weight an poorly constructed. The blade rattles around in the knuckle guard, and the ""wooden"" inlays on grip are plastic. This knife WILL break if you use it for anything more than a show piece. The sheath is a joke. If you were to take this knife and sheath into anything wilder than your backyard it would come home in pieces. I truly fail to see anything in this knife that warrants the rave reviews that it has received on Amazon. Stay away from this one. You will thank me for it."
3,Looks cool,"The knife looks cool but it is the dullest knife I have every seen and it is inpossible to sharpen, there isn't enough angletothe blade to sharpen."
5,Starting a Collection,"This Maxam Hunting Knife is even better than I imagined. The design, the weight and the actual size is perfect for display. The price alone makes it more than worthwhile. I would recommend this to anyone looking to build a collection or just to impress guests with the unique artwork."
3,Cheap quality material,"Well, the price reflects the items value in this case. Though the blade is passable, the wood grip is plastic and the knuckles are of some unknown, cheap metal. Overall though, this products isn't too disappointing."
4,knif,knife was purchased as a Christmas gift. it was exactlwhat we wanted. it was shipped quickly. We're very satisfied with the product and its quality.
1,May be illegal in your state.,"I advise you to check your local and state laws prior to purchasing this knife. I bought one back in 2001/2002 and I had it in my dorm in Newark, NJ. My roommate informed the police and I was arrested. Brass knuckle knives are illegal in many states. In NJ, simply owning it is considered felony weapons possession in the fourth degree."

2,All the parts were not connected. Someone forgot the screws,I really never used it since when I got it out of the box the head part fell apart since someone at the factory forgot to put the screws in. I sent it back and I am waiting for a refund.
1,Total waste of money,Do not waste your money on this vacuum. It is a royal pain to clean. The filter bunches up inside and you have to pull it down to clean it and then you have the dust and dirt all over your hands. The suction power is much too low and you are basically pushing the dirt around. It will pick up lightweight dust but no dirt or sand. It also holds very little before it needs to be cleaned.
1,"dust in, dust out","Has good power & suction, unfortunately the dust continued thru the dust cup back into my room. It is going back to WalMart tomorrow. Definitely do not recommend this cleaner."
2,It really sucks,"Unfortunately, it sucks almost nothing. The motor is very weak, and most particles (even very light ones) require many slow passes in order to be picked up from the carpet or floor."
2,not the same old bissell,"The bissell three way stick vac used to be the best floor vac on the market, with a motor strong enough to suck up a penny, washable filter, easy to clean, and light weight. the only down side was the short lenghth of cord. My previous feather weight model lasted for over a year with daily use. the new one does not have the same motor strength as it doesn't pick up dirt and debris very well. Disappointed because i used to say it was the best 20 bucks I'd ever spent. the search for a floor vac that delivers still continues"
4,For the fans,"I am a Crowdies fan, and this video was given to me by a friend who watched it once and then passed it on. It is great for me as a fan to have as far as collector's purposes, but I wouldn't recommend it to non-fans. Crowdies videos, with the exception of perhaps the ones from the Together Alone album, just aren't that good. Plus, the menu and extra features that go with this are quite stale, but that might be because it was released by Capitol, their North American company. It could have possibly been done better Down Under. For me, it's really a 3-star product, but as a fan I feel guilty giving it less than 4 stars.Bottom line: Fans will enjoy it. If you're a fann wanting to Finn-doctrinate your frenz, though, or curious for the first time about the Crowdies, stick with just the music."
5,A Must Have!,"I had never seen alot of the videos on this DVD, so it was a must have for me. It is interesting to see the bands progress over the years they were together. I highly recommend this DVD to any CH fan!"
2,wheel fell off,I loved this stroller because it was cheap and much smaller than our Graco monster. It took up very little trunk space and I liked the baby tray. It was really hard to steer and shook like crazy when I pushed it on the sidewalk. We this stroller until our son was about fifteen months old and the wheel fell off and we couldn't repair it. Now we are searching for yet another stoller. I wish we would have purchased a nicer one from the get-go.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I bought this stroller, because I needed something bigger than an umbrella stroller, with some storage space. Well, the front wheels get stuck, so I have to kick them to get the stroller go forward, or else it runs into everything. The seat does not sit up very straight, so my kid is always leaning back and then the seat is so small, that he is always sliding forward into the straps. He doesn't like it anymore than I do!DO NOT BUY!"
1,Piece of Junk!!!!!!,"I bought this stroller for a recent trip to Florida. Used it a couple of times before the trip and it seemed to be OK. When I started using it for long periods of times the wheels would lock up. It was completely unsafe! My son would get jolted about when the wheels would lock up. I drove an hour to return it to a ToysRus, but because I did not have the box or receipt (didn't think to pack it in my suitcase) there was nothing they could do for me, even though it is a ToysRus exclusive. I had to go out and buy a new stroller."
1,Poor Quality,I bought this stoller because I was looking for something lightweight. I liked that it had drink holders for me and a snack tray for my son. But after only 2 months the wheel flew off at the mall. I was not able to repair it so I returned it. It was also hard to maneuver with one hand. I am looking for a new one now.
1,Horrible Stroller,I bought this stroller for my grandchildren. I put my 2 yr old in it and snapped the straps. When I finished shopping I got to my car and could not get her out. The clips on the straps were so tight that I could not squeeze them to release it. It is a horrible stroller. I had to get a pair of pliers to release it. I do not recommend anyone buying this stroller.
1,HORRIBLE,I really can't tell you how much this stroller stinks! Please just take my word for it. IT STINKS!
2,disposable stroller,"PROS:lightweight, small, goodlooking, cup holders/basket/trayCONS: very hard to steer, sqeeky wheels from day one, wheel fell off after a few months of very little use. Unrepairable."
3,"Looks good at first glance, but ...","We were looking for a lightweight stroller and this one looked very good for the price (with a tray for the baby as well parents). However, as we started using it, we found the following problems:- The sitting area for the baby is too small. Our son almost slips down sitting on this stroller.- The reclining back does not recline back fully. It almost seems like a cheap economy class seat.- Even though our son is only 7 months old and not very tall, his legs are always hanging.- The shade on the top is very short and almost useless when the sun is bright and strong.All in all, it's not a good choice for a child less than 2 years old."
1,Wheel Fell Off!!!,I bought this a few months ago and have only used it a few times. The wheel fell off last time we were at the mall. Baby trend hasn't returned my e-mails. I don't recommend this stroller to anyone.
1,"too cheaply made, fell apart","Ugh- I thought this would be the answer to all my stroller worries. It only created more problems for me. My 28th month old who is on the short side was too big for this. The recline feature kept falling back into full recline when he was trying to sit up. The seat area is not deep enough so he kept sliding out of it even fully locked in with the seat belts. The seat belts are hard to open/close.But the worst part was that during my recent 5 hour delay at the airport with just me and my son, the darn wheel fell off. Ugh. It was a total nightmare. There is no way to fix it without writing and asking for another and that's just not worth it.Spend more time researching and money and get a better quality stroller. I'm now back at amazon trying to find another replacement before the flight home."
1,HATE IT!!,"I bought this stroller a few months ago. My other stroller is a jogger, so I wanted something smaller. My son is fairly large - 22lbs at 9 months. You can't even push this stroller with him in it. The weight limit says 40lbs, but it should say 20lbs. Not to mention the fact that the ""one-handed"" button is broken and you have to use both hands to pull up on the sides to get it to close. I don't feel that I have over used or abused this stroller. It's gone on maybe 3 long walks and was mostly used for walking from a parking garage to a restaurant or store.I also really hate the seat. It just seems uncomfortable. The back is very straight when the chair is upright and the seat is very short. If you undo the buckle and don't hold onto your baby he'll slide right out.Spend the money and get something that will last, I wish I had."
4,Convenient Stroller,This stroller is very compact and it's not heavy wich means that it's easier for me pick up and fold in the matter of minutes. It makes my life more simple.
4,Light Hearted Christmas Fare,This is a sweet little story about a pig named Geraldine who wants a really big Christmas tree. It's silly and captured my daughter's interest.
3,Critics' Reviews,"This book is not what you would think of as a biography. If you want to find out about Giulietta the woman, you will not find much here. If you want to read the critics' reviews from every performance, then this is the book for you. There is an occasional bit about something interesting that happened to her, but not much. The tribute chapter tells more about her than the bulk of the work, and the cd is definitely worth the price of the book!I hope that one day the Bastianini book is translated into English and becomes available in the USA. What little I've read of it shows it to be more what I personally like in a biography."
4,Nice read,"Having read many singer bios, I came across Simionato's and decided to read it. It's an ok book but not very entertaining. It's basically more a chronology of performances and critical reviews than a real biography. A. Varnay's, C. Ludwig's and B. Nilsson's bios are far more entertaining and thorough....There's a tribute chapter that's way too long. ONLY for hardcore fans"
2,Herva Nelli at La Scala,"On page 51, the author writes that the soprano Herva Nelli, who appeared with Giulietta Simionato in the Boito tribute at the Teatro alla Scala, ""spoke no Italian."" This is not correct; as corroborated by her grand-nephew, who knew her very well, the soprano spoke fluent Italian.In fact, Mme Nelli was a native of Florence, who only moved to America at the age of twelve. Italian was her native language."
1,Most Dissapointing,"I was hoping to upgrade my bookshelf speakers so I threw out the old drivers and I ended up DOWNGRADING to these peices of crap with tweeters and subs to match. Cost me 100 dollars to stamp ""dumb-a$$"" on my forehead.Do not buy!"
2,A Rip-Off,"This product cost almost as much as the Canon MF 4150 printer I teamed it up with and yet:1) Has both a USB and a LPT1, yet can handle only one printer at a time.2) Does not work well with Windows Vista. I have 2 XP machines and 1 Vista machine on my home network, but must re-set the port each time I boot up on the Vista machine. Have also had the network connection to the printer fail twice on the XP machines.3) Got passed off to Canon when I contacted Axis for customer support. They claimed that product was produced for Canon and Canon was responsible for customer technical support. Canon in turn responded with boilerplate tech support that had no chance of correcting the problems I was having with Vista.I am not sure what the alternatives are, but I would avoid this product if at all possible."
3,Interplay's Fallout Collection,"I've always loved these games, and to have them all on one disc is great."
3,Not bad,"It's not a bad game, but I can't get into it much. Fallout 1 suffers from blackouts on XP (I've tried every fix listed online, so I'll probably have to run a virtual machine with Win 95 or something), but Fallout 2 can run on XP fine. I'm about 3 hours into it, though I don't care for it too much. I personally prefer Diablo 2, though Fallout allows much more interaction with the environment.Check out no mutants allowed for the patches and stuff for the game."
2,"super thin, big disappointment","The description informs the buyer that the book is 60 pages, but not that it's 60 small pages with super big type. Plus the editing is horrible -- riddled with typos.It does however deliver a side to Camus not often seen -- the young author, somewhat scared and certainly lonely -- but still with little insight and discussion. It read more like an extended news article."
4,Great PsychoEd Lit for Youngsters and Adults,"I am a social work currently working with a population of children who struggle biologically, emotionally, and behaviorally. It is hard to find good child friendly literature that deal with ADHD. I'm glad I found Putting on the Brakes. It covers many things my kids wonder about and then some. Putting on teh Brakes includes chapters defining the diagnosis, discussing the science behind it, the common feelings one my have, and problem solving. My clients enjoyed the book and especially loved the analogy of ADHD to a car without brakes. (One of my clients is obsessed with cars). However, it delves too much into the science and lacks the active problem solving and skill building that the corresponding work book has. Over all, Putting on the Brakes answers questions and opens the door for great communication between you and your kids, who may struggle with their diagnosis."
1,Extremely Basic...Not for kids over age 6.,"I bought this book for my 9 year old with ADHD with the hopes that it might give him some insight to what the disorder is. This book is more for a 5-6 year old, maybe even younger. The ideas it gives to kids to help with their struggle are extremely basic common sense and not at all creative or very helpful at all. In the ""gaining control"" part that's supposed to give ideas on what can help the kids it says they need to make friends, take their meds and become more organized - with some really basic ideas on how to do those things (ex. to pay better attention at school take notes. YEAH RIGHT, I'm sure he's going to take notes when nobody else in the class is doing so!)...anyway, it says this book is for ages 8-13 but it is DEFINITELY not. I really don't find any part of this helpful."
5,It kept my interest the whole way through!,"I love to read fairy-tales, and I have read a lot of them. This one ranks as one of my favorites- I could hardly put it down. I really don't see how anyone could dislike it or regret reading it to their children, as one reviewer said. John White has a very engaging style of writing, and he makes the characters come alive throughout the story, especially Mab the Prophet, John, and the Changer. It also has a very good ending which you will not expect. If you like fairy-tales and Christian allegories, you will want to read this one. I wish I could give it TEN STARS.LAURA ANDREWS"
3,Tracing history back through time,"With each book of his ""Archives of Anthropos,"" John White weaves a better story, making up for the fact that the writing is a bit plain in style. In this book, we get to travel back in time, rather than forward, and learn more of the history that makes Anthropos so interesting."
3,of london,"A killer known as The Hyena of London is caught and hanged. However almost immediately his body goes missing. In a small village outside of London people begin to die in a manner similar to the way the Hyena killed.Italian Euro-horror shocker that bogs down almost instantly into various love triangles and quadrangles and general romance. More soap opera than horror film the movie never really generates much tension even as its trying to be very Gothic. Not bad as such but I picked this up since it was listed as a horror film and I was expecting thrills and chills not soap. More bland than anything I thought a good deal of this was tedious, though watchable as background noise. The disappointing thing was that many of the revelations seemed to be an after thought.Ultimately a lesser Euro-shocker from Italy (despite the Anglicized credits)"
2,Soul Sides 1 Can't Touch Soul Sides Volume 2,"I heard some cuts from Soul Sides 2 on NPR and liked it immediately so decided to order Volume 1 as well. Well I loved the songs on Soul Sides Volume 2 but Volume 1 was a disappointment. The first 5 songs on V.1 all sound the same. It's hard to differentiate one song from the next. Such as Keep My Baby Warm by Charles May, Masterpiece by Clarence Reid, and No More Sad Songs by Amanda Ambrose all have that 50's music sound - kinda boring (and I'm no spring chicken). V. 2 selections have more flavor such as the hot Fever by Sharon Cash, the gut wrenching Home is Where the Hatred Is by Esther Phillips, and the danceable Che che Cole by the Afro Beat Orchestra is a lot of fun. V. 2 gets my vote but V. 1 is boring!"
3,Inconsistent and Short,"There are much better soul compilations out there than Soul Sides 1. The only reason to get it is for Lee Moses' rare Time & Place (1970), Johnny Guitar Watson's Lovin' You (1974) and Sharon Jones' All Over Again (2005).The inconsistent quality of this collection makes it hard to listen again. Joe Bataan's smooth jazz Ordinary Guy does not fit. No More Sad Songs by Amanda Ambrose is laughably bad. Linda Lyndell's What A Man has been played to death. Piece of My Heart was popularized by Janis Joplin (why include it here?) Jealous Guy is by John Lennon. Doesn't Donny Hathaway have any original songs?The set is needlessly short (clocking in at only 47 minutes). CDs can hold up to 80 minutes.[DW]"
5,2 1/2 yr old twin boys love the frogs,"I bought the frog backpacks for my twin boys before we went on a trip. I let them pick all the things they wanted to put in them and they loved the discovery on the plane. They won't actually wear them as backpacks, but love to carry them around."
2,You can't learn Linux just Visually,"I gave 2 stars just for the nice pictures on book. The RH 6.1 installation is very simple, and don't need a guide for it. What happen if your VideoCard is not in hardware optin list? If you want a consistente introdution to Linux with some images you can try the O'Reilly's ""Running RedHat Linux"" or just choose RedHat 6.1 in a Box with manual and online support."
2,REPACKAGING BASIC MARKETING,Well it is nothing but old and basic marketing from marketing 101 repackaged for the Silicon Valley. I EXPECTED MORE FROM HIM. DISAAPOINTED.
2,"Same Reprise of 60's Marketing read in ""Crossing the Chasm.""","The author's books are examples of the power and magic of creative marketing. ""Crossing the Chasm"" and ""Tornado"" are a reprise of 60's marketing fundamentals re-labelled with Silicon Valley buzz ""stuff."" Relatively harmless reading. But only the young and inexperienced will react with bouncy enthusiasm and the sanctimonius exuberance of one who has just seen the ultimate truths revealed. Those who become apostles should be checked at the door for relative intelligence, levels of experience and the age on their driver's license. The ""oldsters"" will be smiling in the back of the bus and watching the ""youngster"" marketing ""pros"" be out-smart-keted by one of their professed own as he deposits the change in his growing bank account as his enlightened followers eagerly line up with money in hand."
1,More Moore insulting consulting for The Chasm Group ...........,"On the final page he says, (I kid you not) ""At the end of the day ... Trust, it turns out, is a complicated and challenging relationship ..."". 238 pages for that ?????And at the end of the day, he has used ""at the end of the day"" seven times in this book. Once is a lazy but acceptable cliche, but seven times seems like there is nothing happening upstairs, or maybe his name is the pseudonym of a well remunerated talking parrot. He uses ""to be sure"" 20 times. Anyone care to track other cliche counts? I'm done."
2,Mundane: read Chasm,This is a weak sequel to Crossing the Chasm. Chasm was original and insightful. Tornado is full of cliches and mangled metaphors.
5,This book will blow your mind!,"The Accelerators grabs you in the very first chapter, and doesn't let go even after you've finished it. It's unlike any book I've read before, and as soon as I read it I had to buy it for almost all of my friends. It was amazing the way the story included so many actual historical events, making you think about reality and the entire history of the world in a whole new light. I've never read a book this good before! Thinking about it makes me want to go read it again!"
3,DEMI SUCCES,Autant Herreweghe est un chef acclamé quand il dirige Bach (il suffit d'écouter les enregistrements de ses passions ou de la messe en si pour ce rendre compte qu'il n'usurpe pas sa réputation)autant il se retrouve bien souvent décrié quand il s'écarte du répertoire baroque.On ne peut que rester dubitatif devant cette interprétation très personnelle du chef belge en effet la violence de ce requiem s'accomode mal de la direction d'Herreweghe qui ote a cette messe des morts toute son intensité dramatique (à coté de celui de la version d'Harnoncourt le dies irae fait ici pale figure)On voit dans le requiem dirigé par Herreweghe comme une résignation face à la mort on se retrouve alors bien loin de l'mage couramment véhiculée d'un Mozart fébrile composant son réquiem à l'article de la mort. Il convient tout de meme d'ajouter que la prise de son de cet enregistrement est excellente
1,Huge waste of money,"This ring looks beautiful in the picture but when you see it in reality, the cubic zirconia so small and the ring looks so tiny. Also, the cubic zirconia is dull. The ring I received looks like it was worn. Very disgusted with my purchase. Won't buy from this seller again. I do not like false imaging. The ring looks cheap and should be sold for much less. A real rip-off!"
4,"From bottom up, with great examples","I not only have the book but I also took the coarse at the school that the Author teaches at (I didn't get a chance to take it with Prof. Popkin). The book walked me through the steps of learning COBOL with excellent examples. Great for someone who is new to COBOL or is really not into programming, like I am. I even bought the compiler program that you can use on your Windows or DOS PC or laptop which was a great help. Recommended for students and beginners."
2,Mainly for those interested in linguistics and translation,"The book title says it all really. It discusses a lot about linguistic/rhetoric/discourse usage and styles in The Quran. This is good for those interested in this and translation. I bought it because I thought it would discuss these things THEN highlight references in The Quran itself and show the reader what this tells us, or how it can be helpful in terms of understanding The Quran. It doesn't really do that. It mainly sticks to the dry linguistics. The book does more to educate than illuminate."
3,Power-Picking from one of today's masters,"Dan Crary, best known for his work with Berline, Crary & Hickman, is one of the cleanest power-pickers on today's scene, along with Tony Rice. The vocals are OK, especially if you like baritone voices (he often plays a special long-necked Taylor that is tuned lower for his vocal range) but that's not why he's in demand in studios. Like Doc Watson, his showpieces are fiddle tunes transposed to guitar. ""Bugle Call Rag"" and his medleys are played with dazzling speed and his trademark power runs - no tentative notes, just the pure confident hard licks at hand-blurring speed that won the national flat-picking championship. The last track, ""Build me a cabin"" is probably the best vocal on the album, a slower gospel number that lets your heart rate return to normal..."
5,"I love the music, that Will Smith!","I like Will Smith alot and I like his new song ""Just the two of us"". I hope he'll be making some new and really good songs soon. His son Troy sounds so cute at the end of the song of ""Just the two of us"". To bad that you (Will Smith) will not be on any T.V shows any more I also thought that the movie ""The Men In Black"" was really good. That movie gets 5 golden stars in my oppion.Oh, the other song I like is ""Gettn' Jiggy Wit'it. now that was the boom of the centery. That is all I really have to say about your music and movie."
5,A must - to educate yourself,"If you are suffering from the sideeffects of having a fibroid you MUST read this book. It is simple and not technical in its explanations. I have not completed it yet but so many of the concepts, ideas and recommendations are easy to follow. It talks so much about diet change, a complete body approach and not being disillusioned by what more conventional western doctors prescribe."
5,Best Info. for Taking Action,"This book is the best, most informative book I've read on my newly discovered condition (and believe me I have read a lot). It gives very practical information especially with regard to diet. It was a little bit lacking in the last chapter ""Putting Your Own Healing Program Together,"" as well as the parts about exercise and meditation. But for diet alone, this book is well worth it and you'll know what to do on your own as well as with the help of a practitioner."
2,Not enough breeds included,"While the book does show how to draw a few dog breeds, not enough are included. Also, the instructions are specific to certain poses, rather than including some dog anatomy lessons. Once the few how-tos are done there really isn't a need to refer to this book. There are other better and more inclusive how to draw dogs books available."
2,Mediocre at best leather binder,The quality of the leather and covers is marginal. I have had the notebook for about 6 months and have no issues with the inner core mechanics. Would look elsewhere for a quality leather binder at this price.
1,Very low quality,"I was disappointed in the quality of this binder. The cover was rippled and not smooth. For what I paid, I expected to receive a binder that was actually presentable."
3,Bialetti Class stainless gasket source,"I've had a hard time finding gaskets for my stainless steel 9 cup Bialetti Class coffee maker as well. I just ordered them from Expresso Zone, item number GAS-310. [...]"
1,"I Agree with 1st review, 9 cup filter doesnt fit my unit...","Very frustrating. 1st, this is a great little expresso maker, but its now useless without the filter. Capacity is not listed on the maker itself; I bought a 4 cup filter/gasket, too small. Then a 6 cup, too small; then a 9 cup, and just a little too small. So I assume its a 10 cup maker. Where can I find a 10 cup filter??To the filter manufacturer: how about listing the diameter of the filter/gasket; what an idea."
5,buy it,"This man might be the hardest working carver on the planet. You will not believe his glue ups. Incredible vision in his work. If you fail to learm something , wake up."
2,Carving,"The book High Relief Wood Carving/W.J.Schnute---this book did very little for me its in black and white few color pages very little instruction,not a very good book for learning good as a general reference book.Might be ok to carve signs,but overall it lacks in detailed explainations and generaly not a very good book on carving although the cover shows otherwise."
1,Waste of money,I had to get this book for my college course and I can say it really is quite bad. There doesn't seem to be enough useful examples and it really is quite hard to learn much from this book. There are also a lot of errors in this book. Many questions are worded poorly too.
5,Richly Detailed and Riveting Life Story,A well written biography of one of Hollywood's most legendary actors. I couldn't put it down. Totally engrossing and engaging. I highly recommend it if you want a good read.
2,Hunnicutt and earlier review,An earlier reviewer mentioned Hunnicutt and a shower scene. It is NOT functionally nudity as the camera does not go below the shoulders and it is just a few seconds long. Not remotely worth comment except to warn.
3,The Spiral Staircase,"This film is not the best or the worst I have ever watched. Not having seen the earlier film of the same title, I can't make a comparison, but it does sometimes fail to convince. But any film starring Christopher Plummer gets my vote."
1,You'll likely be disappointed,"If you purchase this cover for the LG Chocolate, you'll likely be disappointed. I could never get the covers to pop on and stay. I always felt like I was going to pull the 2 portions of the phone apart. I was able to get one part of the cover to stay, but then when I put the other part on, one or the other would pop loose.I will say that the company that shipped the cover was real responsive to providing another cover - just the half that wasn't working - but it didn't work any better. After messing around with it for 2-3 weeks, I finally just sent the whole thing back. They gladly refunded my money."
4,Interesting case for reincarnation,"Kind of heavy on phenomena such as near death experiences and brain physiology and light on Zen and Physics. Still, a very readable book, given complicated concepts discussed and certainly interesting. The author makes a good case for reincarnation without heavy religious overtones. Worth reading."
2,Being a scientist doesn't make a book scientific.,"This book is a disconnected jumble of thoughts about the mind, soul, self, etc. The author is a physicist who is willing to claim (or let his publishers claim) scientific merit to his opinions about consciousness. He concludes that the ""most reasonable"" explanation of near-death experience reports is that the mind is being freed from the confines of the brain. Most reasonable?? I didn't read the whole book"
4,Good book for measurement applications of Photodiodes,"This book is an excellent reference for understanding the Photodiode circuits. It is gives good coverage of the limitations of the transimpedance amplfier, gives good comparision of different schemes for I to V convertors and covers noise in photodiode circuits extensively. It is a good text for low frequency application . Not meant for real high speed design reference."
4,good book for measurement circuits not for receiver design,Excellent book for design of optical measurement etc type of application and undrestand noise and errors in the circuit.
3,Works but very Noisey,"I had previously owned a Kenmore Trash Compactor (many years ago) and I thought they would all be about the same. I liked the color choices on the Braun. However, the compression cycle is VERY long and noisey - even when it is more than half full. Other than that, it does work. The plastic bags are hard to position so they don't get caught during compaction. The paper lined ones are much better.Broan Trash Compactor - Black/Biscuit"
5,Easy Installation,"This took me less than 10 minutes to install. No complications setting up the beams, the door closed the first time I made an attempt. Works better than ever!"
3,safety beams need instructions,Product seems to fit the bill but absolutely no instructions given on proper installation technique. Small plastic buttons for slicing wires not clearly shown how to use or install.
4,GARAGE DOOR T-BEAM SENSOR,"Good. Much cheaper than one you can but at Home Depot. Does the job. Hey, It is just a garage door sensor!!!"
5,Fixed my opener - hurray!,When it got cold my garage door would not close. It acted like something was breaking the safety beam. I suspected bad/weak sensors and took a chance on these replacements hoping it would solve the problem and I would be spared the cost of a new opener. It did!. It came with great wire connecters that were pressure fit. They made the wiring very easy.
5,Safety Beam Eyes,"These worked great once I figured out the trick. I installed them, then the door opener would not work at all. After I unplugged the opener and disconnected the ""eyes"" from the opener for 5 minutes, I then reattached the eyes and it now works like new."
4,Garage Door Opener Eyes,I was very pleased with th e product and especially the price. other websites listed one eye for the price that I paid for two!!! Now that is a deal.
5,This is what I wanted,"This is what I wanted. My old one is too old, so sometimes it doesn't work.I changed it to new one and everythin is working fine, now.It is very easy to change it, too.Thank you."
5,Great product,These replacement safety beams could not have been easier to install. The wire splices included were so simple. Whole job took around 10 minutes and the cost was about half as much as the same product from my local garage door repair place.
5,Great Delivery--Perfect Replacement Product,Very fast delivery....replaced old product perfectly...no problems...easy install..garage door now functions properly. Had to reverse where transmitter was due to sunlight interfering with light beam...that was part of the problem.
3,Does not replace all the models it says it does.,Does not replace all the Chamberlan models it says it does. Measure the existing ones first if this is for replacements.
1,Defective products,"I bought this product last month and installed it. It did not work and there is not even light. I replaced them with the products from local Lowes, they are working.I asked the seller to get my money back, it ends up only refunded me half the price I paid."
5,Safety Beam,"If you are having problems with your Liftmaster/Chamberlain Garage door opener closing your door during the day, especially after noon, get these beams. Easy to replace-all needed parts enclosed including wire connectors. The price is right, these are OEM parts, and they fixed the problem."
4,"Works Great, but short cord","I bought a new house and had to replace the sensors for the garage door. These were way cheaper than I could find from Sears, plus they were delivered to my door in a matter of days rather than drive an hour to hit a warehouse. The only issue I have is related to the cords that connected the sensors to the unit. The cords that extend from the sensors are only a few feet, and if there was something wrong with the existing wires, I would have had to buy an additional length of wire to connect to the opener. It didn't specify any length of cord in the description (they also come with nice little crimps that make it easy to spice the wires), but luckily it all worked fine and I can close the garage."
1,A defective product,I bought this a few months ago and install last week. It did not work and there is not even light. I bought one from local Lowes instead and they worked fine.I ended up throw it away since it pass the return date.
5,excellent product,This product worked beautifully. It was easy to install. It just happened to be the same exact product I was replacing.
4,The Fox Cub Bold,"This fourth instalment sees a young cub wild in the ""real world"" for the first time after voluntarily segregating himself from his friends and his father, ""the Farthing Wood fox"", whose shadow continues to hang over him.Impressively Dann manages to draw immediate focus to a single character and his few acquaintances after spending so much time on the huge Farthing Wood cast. He does so with grace and clarity, creating a story that presents itself with crystal clarity whilst prompting strong emotional responses in the reader. It's hard to believe that a fox's circumstances could illicit such powerful responses!The protagonist is superbly draw and rounded in a way that I don't see even in most adult fiction. You'll be swept along in a wonderful, funny, and very sad story that has always been my favourite of the series.9/10"
1,Seen better,A complete waste. This is not in anyway shape or form a tarot desk. The artwork is poor and the instructions horrible.
4,Fresh Sound,"Its good to hear a group from the 90s sing like this, the first sound that comes to mind? to name a few, theSmithereens,the Raspberries.....and yes its Beatlsque, Especially a tune like the VERY catchy ""Stood In The Rain"". Other highlights on this CD are ""Ripley"", ""Less Then Nowhere"", ""The Joker Laughs At You"". A great cover of the Kinks ""I Need You"". In other words? this CD is worth the money."
5,on second thoughts....,"I wrote the two-star review above (below?). On rehearing it, I think that I might have been a bit too harsh. Certainly after all the palaver I'd heard I was expecting something special and I felt let down when I didn't get it. To my mind, there remains no doubt that Pinnock's old recording for Archiv remains clearly the best in the field, bar none. However, this recording, while lacking the bounce and exuberance of Pinnock, is nicely played. I think 3.5 stars is about correct, so, if I award it five stars now, my rating will average out to what I think is the correct one. But do yourself a favour and hear Pinnock before you buy this one!"
2,Ordinary,"Don't be taken in by the palaver on the back of the CD box. This is a competent performance, but, in my opinion, dull, dull, dull. The best version remains Pinnock's wonderful late '80s version for DG Archiv which sparkles with life like no other I know."
4,A Real Sleeper,"I recall renting this a few years back just because of the two leads (Eric Roberts and Lance Henriksen) being teamed, as each are fine character actors, and the premise of a good, old-fashioned mystery/thriller.As it turned out, this is a taunt little chiller with a great premise and even better ending. I won't give anything away, but the ending is truly worth the price of admission. Roberts and Henriksen are at the top of their game, and Director Victor Silva (pre JEEPERS CREEPERS) sets just the right tone.I'm only hoping they come up with a few worthwhile extras to boot. A commentary by Silva would be a great bonus.Top notch suspense."
4,Nature of the Beast DVD,"Not my favorite,but a decent movie none the less.The interaction of Lance Henriksen's and Eric Roberts' characters,was what made the movie."
5,Wonderful self-affirming book for children!,"This beautifully illustrated book celebrates the color black and, in a world where all things white are placed on a pedestal, has the indirect effect of encouraging African-American children to embrace who they are and how they look. Replaces negative connotations associated with black, e.g. ""blackmail"", ""black market"", and focuses on all of the good things in our world that are black. Our children, ages 3 and 5, list this as one of their favorites. Read and enjoy!"
5,The Best,"Buy with total confidence from this seller....super fast shipment, great communication and book in great condition!!"
2,Some great fundamental concepts but lacks of actual insights,"Kroenke wrote a book dating back to 1994. As a lecturer I was advised to use this book, among others I'd choosen myself. After an extensive reading of this book I had to admit that some chapters are very good, because they give students a fundamental insight in management information systems, but for the title being ""Management Information Systems"" the chapters about personal information systems (5-7) aren't worth reading them. Also the book lacks actuality, e.g. a 486-PC with 8 MB is mentioned to be necessary for running windows. An update or revision, with more emphasis on Management Information Systems would be valuable."
1,"don't trust the seller(Monday, Mundy)",I never received the book. I was told the seller cancelled the order and refunded half. He never answered my e-mails inquiring about the situation.
2,A little less than expected,"I had it in a timely manner, but the book was covered with stickers, more than just the usual designating it as used, and it was not the same edition of the book as the ISPN I searched. I think it should have been a lower price for the condition reasons,(worn and excessively covered with stickers)."
1,Professors: PLEASE do NOT make your classes read this text book,"This text book is awful. When I signed up for the class that required me to read this book I expected to learn about information systems, not the latest trends and the authors opinions on them. Yes, I know that there is no way to completely protect an MIS book from becoming outdated, but when a big portion of the book talks about iPhones and twitter it is a waste of my time. I already know about these things just from functioning in the world. An MIS class should be focused on INFORMATION SYSTEMS.... not trends of the tech world. If I wanted to learn about that I would read tech blogs. This book is basically a ridiculously overpriced tech review and opinion blog. It has caused my Information Systems class to be the biggest waste of my time and money in college."
1,Didn't even read the book,Didn't even read the book. Bought the book for $100 last semester. Book is now worth only $3? The online tutorial and activities were useless and pointless and a complete waste of time. Activation codes are only good for one semester. Robbery!!!
3,Good textbook,"I thought this was a good textbook to learn from, it is probably outdated tech wise by now though, these dont last very long"
4,Came in great condition!,It came in great condition as described. They also got the item to me well before my class and for a much more reasonable price than the bookstore at my school was going to charge me!
4,"...his first ""real"" solo record","I've been a fan of Guided By Voices ever since I heard ""My Valuable Hunting Knife"" on a local radio station in the summer of 1996. Ten years later I'm still listening to Bob Pollard's work (while a lot of the bands that I was into back then seem ridiculous now). ""From A Compound Eye"" is easily his best work since 2001's ""Isolation Drills"". In contrast to his last few releases with GBV, his latest outing seems to keep things sharper without all the layered, (sometimes overcomplicated) guitar parts. The vocals are also stellar. If you're a fan of GBV you'll love this cd. Even if you're looking for some great rock music, get this cd."
4,The electrifying confusion,"Style-wise, this sounds pretty much like the last two Guided by Voices albums. It's a slow grower, owing to the dense mix of different kinds of songs and the lack of any true standout tracks like ""The Best of Jill Hives"" or ""Everybody Thinks I'm a Raincloud."" The biggest problem with the album is the seemingly random arrangement of the tracks; it's hard to get a listening momentum going with so many jarring transitions. I'd recommend this album to Bob fanatics (like they need a recommendation anyway) but it's not the friendliest place for a novice to enter the Pollard/GBV world."
3,mostly great rock cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"almost all of these songs are classic pollard rockers except the last song on the cd really blows, otherwise i would give it 4 stars. bob really sounds inspired on some of these melodies. the song the right thing is a great cuz the intro is bob and acoustic guitar only and sounds like you are hearing the song just as it first came out of bob drunken head!! then it kicks in to a full on rock roll song. this guy has a knack for melody and lyrics and also does impressive rock moves on stage live at age 48 (i think he is maybe 49?)."
3,"Same story, different disc","Basically, the review for this disc is pretty much interchangeable with reviews for any other disc by RP or GBV - you have to make the inevitable remarks about quality control and how there are great gems buried here, 'neath all the dross...basically you get to be RP's A&R; guy for him.Still, you have to give RP credit : the guy has a pretty canny gift for melody, when he's able to focus it, and lyrically speaking, he's capable of some fascinating, fractured whimsy...So, in a nutshell: unless you're just a complete GBVhead this is, well....not so essential...."
2,Not that great,"I had a subscription to The Saddle Club book club, i got a new book every month, my mom cancelled my subscription because the way Stevie gets better can't happen in real life (My mom is a doctor). So this was not one of Bryant's best."
5,FANTASTIC!,"I loved this book and still do! Stevie's a hilarious character, and when she has dreams Carole and Lisa take them at advantage. Their revenge scheme on Veronica was histerical. My favorite part of the story was the rescue mission for Phil and his uncle. If you love horses, friendships, and do not think Stevie can be normal, than read this book and see for yourself!"
1,Sappy Romance,"It is my own fault, really. I'm not a sappy, romance novel type of person. I was cooped up with a cold, and I borrowed this book from my mother. I did finish the book, which is about three different love stories, with all the stories based in Texas. I found the characters to be 2 dimensional, and I found the murder mystery actually very silly. I also found several grammar mistakes. I would not recommend this book."
1,UGH!!!!!!,"The good reviews baffle me! Such a total waste of my time I cant believe i actually sat through over an hour, just because I'm a RIchard Hell fan. Can't understand why Hell would subject himself to this crap. Two minutes of fun with amateur gore effects ten minutes prior to the end of the film, nor Hell, cannot redeem it. It's worse than a bad student film, certainly not worth the money they spent on its production. And the additional short films aren't even worth the fast-forward view, simply horrendous. I'm just thankful for the OFF button."
2,geek maggot bingo,These films are very bizarre haha. They are kind of hilarious at the same time. I'd say these have a huge random factor and are for those seeking the most underground of films.
3,Daniel Johnston Lives,"I read the couple of reviews about this CD before purchasing it. I think that it has a ""nostalgic air"" to it. I would not give it 5 star but I have been captivated by Daniel Johnston lyrics and music. His performance of the songs on this CD are very rough. I have seen a few YouTube.com performances of his where he sings with a band live. I think these are much better versions of the songs than the ones on the CD. Don't let this stop you from purchasing this CD however. It's a good introduction to Dan Johnston music. It's been interesting getting to know who Daniel is as an music artist. I would buy the CD again."
2,"Good for heat, lousy for dexterity","As the other reviewers mentioned, these do a great job protecting from heat. Never a fear.My concern is dropping something. The silicone part over the hand is somewhat flexible, but really only for folding your fingers straight back into the palm. I find almost every time I'm trying to grab something that my fingers are moving under the glove because it has no give in any direction other than folding it flat. So there's no real conforming to the shape of your hand or what you're trying to grab. It leaves one with a feeling that you don't have a very secure grip."
4,My thoughts,"An in-depth look at the every day lives of Confederate soldiers.This film expertly utilizes the knowledge and expertise of Michael Kraus, one of the world's leading authorities on Civil War military history. A very interesting historical film!"
3,Pretty ring but...,"It is a very pretty ring, but sadly, no, it will not pass as a diamond. No one will be fooled by this stone. The stone is dull and has no light, no life to it. But then again, it is a ring under $20.00, so what can we expect?"
5,Cheap price but good quality,"This set is a great little set if you are needing some deep-sockets. Good price, and excellent quality. I would recommend this to anyone!"
5,Marylene Dosse truly makes the piano sparkle,"This is a collection rare to come across: the complete piano works by Saint-Saens. As a native of France, Ms. Dosse accomplishes the nearly impossible task of recording the entirety of this difficult french repertoire. Her masterful understand of the music is apparently throughout every piece and her musicality extends far past that of many of the great pianists. In addition to the extraordinary playing, the set is marvelously priced. This is a set to add to your collection."
3,"Nice collection, poor sound","This is a very nice collection of pieces that are rarely heard, rightfully so in some cases. But others, such as the Beethoven Variations for 2 pianos, are wonderful - but the piano sound! Ouch! The pianos are not even in tune! Still, it is a collection worth having, especially at this price."
2,Decent performances but terrible sound quality,"The performances on this collection were decent, although it is somewhat hard to judge them, not being familiar with most of the items. However, the sound quality is way below expectations for something that was originally recorded in ca. 1974 (more like what one would expect from the 1920s or 1930s). There are inexplicable bumps and pops (no pits or scratches obvious on the CDs), and the general acoustics are very subdued (as if the transfer were done using a tape recorder on a monophonic turntable). One cannot claim that it this way because of the budget price - other labels have managed to do much better in their offerings at this price point (such as the D. Scarlatti sonata selection by Pletnev on Virgin Classics which I had purchased in the same order as this CD set)."
1,Unavailable,"I ordered this product Nov. 23, 2008, and about two weeks later (after I received an email saying it had shipped), I received another email saying it was out of stock and they were not planning to restock, so I don't understand why it's still being offered for sale. In light of my experience, I would think it would be a waste of your time to order this product (plus the hassle of waiting to receive a refund)."
5,God's Awesomeness Demonstrated Through One Man's Life,"In 1996, a friend loaned me their copy of Bold as a Lamb just one month prior to our trip to China. This book gave me a stronger understanding of the real presecution that takes place everyday in this fallen world that desperately needs Jesus Christ. This book recounts the story of one Christian man's life within the wallls of China. How he spent over 20 years of his life in prison because of his faith in Jesus Christ. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone Christian or not. Also, to those who teach High School or College students this would be an excellent book for classroom reading and discusion. While in China, I personally met Pastor Samual Lamb and worshiped with his home church."
5,An Incredible Book!,I consider this book one of the most important ones I've read! An inspiring life lived for God in a country that is hostile to Christians.
4,"Cheaper over time, but still work well","Like with many mass produced products, they can often get cheaper (quality) over time. I had a set of Tiger Claws 20 years ago and remember them being of better quality (thicker, heavier stitching and padding). The finger hole openings weren't stitched well which cause some binding/circulation with a prolonged fist. I remember the padding around the wrist being more substantial than they are now. Otherwise they serve their purpose well and I like that you don't get as slimy/sweaty with these like you do with typical foam gear."
3,OK Futon,"I recieved my futon on time, but the wood pieces had some gouges in them, just some minor scratches that are not too noticeable, and a bolt was missing. The directions to put it together are not very good. The pieces come labeled on seran wrap and you have to keep them separated and not mix them up. There is no room for error, every piece has to fit together perfect and there is a lot of tightening and pulling to get the holes lined up. Then they stamp the pieces with pink and if you clear coat it you can see the pink stamp. Very nice when it is all put together, but it is hard to find a cover for a nine inch mattress unless you look forever and want to pay an arm and a leg. All together the order was about 380 bucks, 70 bucks for shipping. The packages are very heavy. It took about 3 hours to get it together."
2,Not the best,I flew to read it because Lynn Kurland. It's not very good--imaginative though. Ms. Kurland can't really write short stories--her characters always hint at something deeper which can't be brought out in a short story very well--unless you are P.G. Wodehouse. Short stories are sometimes more difficult than books. Can't wait for your next book Ms. Kurland!!!
3,Excerpt From Back of Book,"The deliveryman isn't looking for Cassidy Maxwell, female corporate CPA. He's seeking the coincidentally named Maxwell Cassidy, laid-back computer genius-and a first rate pack rat. By the time Cassidy sorts out the mix-up, all of her new neighbor's wordly goods have been delivered to her teensy apartment-and the alarmingly charming owner isn't far behind!It's a tough job, but someone's got to teach Cassidy how to lighten up. Who better than happy-go-lucky Max? He's determined to show the uptight Ms. Maxwell that life holds far greater rewards than a big raise and a corner office. Rewards like falling in lvoe, getting married-even changing her troublesome name. And if you ask him, Cassidy Cassidy has a nice ring to it."
2,This was a very disappointing effort by Lynn Kurland !,"I love Lynn Kurland's books but this one left me feeling disappointed. I honestly think this was a waste of my money and time. Her short story ""The Icing on the Cake"" was, by far, the weakest in the group. The characters were flat and the situation unbelievable---even for this reader who likes time travel romance ! Sydney and Sam just didn't seem the type to fall in love, and the character of Sam (and her life story) was especially far-fetched.The other short stories were mildly entertaining but certainly the whole book was waste of time. I can only hope that future story anthologies, like this, will be better."
1,Doesn't work:(,"I bought this player about a month ago (along with a charger and rechargable batteries) so that I use it while jogging. I was a little disappointed to find that there are no accessories, like a jogging strap, that come with the player...or, for that matter, that I could buy serperately. After 3 weeks, some of the LCD screen burnt out (not that big of a deal for me), but shortly after that, the player would not read discs--ANY discs--MP3 disks, WMA disks, even commercial 'by artist' discs."
1,really bad device that doesn't work and is dangerous,I ended up throwing this thing out after one use. It basically won't stay together and doesn't actually take off skin well except in chunks. Really very dangerous.
1,How does this product work?,I can't figure out how this is supposed to work. the blade falls out at the slightest. There are no clear instructions on the package. A small set of instructional diagrams would go a long way. Totally useless at this point and possibly dangerous. I am not at all sure how to install the blade and use this product. Help Revlon!Revlon Callus Shaver With 5 Replacement Blades
1,Threw this away after the first use,"The blade would not stay in place and we couldn't figure out how it is intended to be used? Not only does it NOT come with instructions, but there doesn't seem to be any instructions or user guide available on the Internet? I think even a ""one"" Star rating may be to high :)"
1,Save your money,"This product was poorly designed. The blade doesn't even stay in place or fit properly. I ""used"" it once and then threw it away.Save your money and buy a better product."
5,A great guide for any Pokemon Fan!,An absolute must for any true Pokemon fan that wants to have a picturesque view of over 380 Pokemon with all the details on their moves. I wish my kids would study for tests the way they study this book!
5,A hit with my kid,Got this for my seven year old daughter at Christmas and one month later she's still consulting it for information. She also uses it to draw pokemon. It's also pretty durable so should hold together despite constant use.
4,"Great, but..","It's great for any Pokémon fan, however, it does not have any of the Diamond and Pearl pokémon which I found disappointing."
2,Big Disappointment - Just a Bunch of Charts!,"I bought this book for my friend's 7-year-old daughter who just loves Pokemon and is having some trouble reading. I thought it would have a page on each pokemon explaining its powers and evolutions. Instead it is just a bunch of charts (crammed 3 to a page) listing the moves that the pokemon can learn in the Nintendo video games.This book is directly tied to the VIDEO GAMES. If your children watch the cartoons more than they play the games, THIS IS NOT the book for you. There are NO PICTURES of the human characters familiar to the cartoon!!! Must be a licensing rights issue.The only use this book will be to my little friend is to show her the evolution paths of pokemon. It will offer VERY little reading help. I would not recommend this book for anyone under 10 years old because of the small type and generally complicated text."
5,I just saved myself a trip to the chiropractor,"I've been having back pain for the past few weeks. I actually own this DVD but have never really done the workouts on it. Today my lower back was in such pain that I decided to bite the bullet and do the entire workout. It was very easy, pleasant and calming, and at the end of it... NO MORE PAIN! This deserves 10 stars!"
5,Wonderful tool,"I bought this DVD after having sprained my back last year. I had then to stop my usual workout for a while. I've used it many times since then... every time I feel tensed or my back or joints ache, especially after a tense day at the office.A very simple, slow, soothing, relaxing 30-mins DVD that shows many postures, from head to toe, to help one heal from chronic pain. This DVD shows modified classic yoga postures. And I regularly choose a specific posture among them, when I want to stretch a particular body part during the day or before I go to bed or when I wake up. The instructors are perfect, smooth, professional and quite skilled (looked their background on the net).A truly good program for those of us who live a stressful and often painful life! Enjoy!"
4,good but short and rushed,"I got the DVD Health Yoga for Aches and Pains. I like the routine and it's perfect for someone like me who's looking for gentle yoga and has to be very careful due to severe back problems. However, my problem with this DVD is two fold. First, it's a short 30-min routine. There's no extended or add on routine. Second, the routine is a bit rushed. Considering this is gentle yoga, the changes between poses is swift and you're not given enough time to come out of one pose and to move into the next. It's very sudden, which is definitely not the ideal way for the audience this is intended for -- people with injuries, aches, and pains. That said, I do like the routine."
2,"Too fast, too rehearsed",Definitely not for a yoga beginner. The narration is twice as fast as I can actually do the poses and the narrator isn't actually doing them. The poses have been over-rehearsed and are too fast to follow. The music covers up the narrator part of the time. I have arthritis and other pain so I can't do the poses at breakneck speed. I'm giving my copy to a charity yard sale.
3,"not the best for my ""bad days""","I have severe arthritis and I bought this dvd because on a good day I'd prefer to go for a walk or try something outdoors but on a bad day I'd still like to accomplish something physical while indoors. Maybe I am more limited than most but I have not once ever made it through the end of a session on this dvd. I can get through all or at least most of programs like PBS's Sit and Be Fit but these instructors move a little too fast for me and into poses that hurt or I'd have to modify every move.Everyone is different and I'm sure this program works for someone but it would be helpful since there are two teachers if they would demonstrate in tandem a way for even the most achy-and-pained to participate, or possibly add a small section geared specifically for those ""bad days""."
4,slow and easy,This is a very good DVD for people who are not advanced practitioners of yoga. It's a slow easy pace and helps with lower back pain.
2,not what I expected,I was hoping for a yoga dvd geared toward back problems. But since I've taken yoga off and on for many years. I found this to be to simple/easy. Maybe if you've never taken yoga and you have flexibility trouble this maybe useful. But for me it was not what I was hoping for.
1,Really,Are they serious? This was a ridiculous 'yoga' video. Who are these people? I am so tired of 'yoga teachers' (and I use that term loosely for these two) who have nothing creative to offer. This DVD was a waste of time and money. The movements were ridiculously simple and offered no real stretch or benefit to the body. Don't bother with it unless you want to waste your time and money too.
4,Good beginner DVD,"This is a good beginner DVD that slowly moves through each of the positions and focuses a lot on proper breathing. Other DVD's (Yoga for inflexible people & Yoga basics) that I bought talked about breathing but not as well. I'm in my mid 50's and have lost a lot of hearing - this DVD has a feature that allows you to turn off the background music so that you can hear just the voices. When I turn up the volume on the other two DVDs above the music gets louder and I still can't hear the female voices except for my wifes saying turn down the volume. This DVD has only one yoga routine, whereas the two others have numerous - reason for a 4 versus a 5 rating. If you are in your mid 50's or older and have lost a lot of flexiblity - I would recommend this DVD, then Yoga for inflexible people and then Yoga basics by Gaiam. They are all good beginner yoga DVD's."
4,Good yoga tape for people with disabilities,"Bought this dvd for my partner, who has physical disabilities. She can't do all the exercises, but enjoys doing what she can.I am not disabled and do the exercises with her, modifying the Yoga poses to make them more challenging.Nice product overall"
1,Not for me...so glad I only RENTED it!,"First, I wish someone would explain to me how/why the price of this DVD went up to over $75!!! What's with that?? I rented this DVD from Netflix because of the glowing reviews both here on Amazon, and on Netflix. It's approximately 35 minutes long. I have a herniated disk and arthritis in my lower back, a chronic pain. I did some yoga over 30 years ago when I was in my 30's, but haven't done it in a long time. I would agree with some of the other comments that the poses are not held long enough. Yes, the poses are very easy, but you can get that with almost ANY beginner yoga video. My back pain is not caused by stress, so lying on the floor and breathing deeply really does nothing for me. They DID demonstrate a few poses using a chair, which I thought quite interesting. All in all, though, I intend to look elsewhere."
5,It's The Real Thing Baby...,"This book tells the true story of Motown's beauty Tammi Terrell and follows her through her childhood, adulthood, and untimely death. It's written in a way that you feel that the authors aren't hiding anything but are informing us of this young lady. It also features interviews with the great Ashford & Simpson, family and friends and many more.At a very young age Tammi new what she wanted and made it happen. Tammi isn't portrayed as a good or bad person, just Thomasina Montgomery as she really was.5+++ stars!!!"
3,interesting second hand information,"My sister Tommie was an interesting summer read for me. I have heard Tammie Terrells music as a kid growing up in Mt.Airy and had heard some of the older neighborhood ladies talking of her from their experiences of knowing her or seeing her at the uptown theatre back in the day. I felt the book was written from supressed bitter sweet memories from the author and unfortunately did not go deep enough or give the reader enough depth about Ms.Terrell to completely keep someone not from that era interested in reading any further material about Ms. Terrell. I think this book was good for the author, Ms.Ludie, for a continuing process of healing. I wish her continued blessings."
1,The worst-edited book I have ever seen,"I am a South Jersey native (high school class of 1971) and a devoted fan of Tammi Terrell. I've purchased many CDs of her solo and duet recordings, and love her voice. That said, I must now say that I have no idea how the publisher of this book (Bank House Books) let this volume be published in this sad shape. Almost every page is rife with the most basic spelling and grammar errors. For example, the name of Jerry Blavat, a Philadelphia/South Jersey rock and roll legend of TV and radio, is misspelled on page 121. On page 24, the name of Crispus Attucks, a black Revolutionary war hero, is spelled ""Cripus Attacks."" Throughout the book, there is more of the same: random capitalizations, fragmented sentences, and misspellings. The publisher should be ashamed, and the lovely Miss Tammi Terrell certainly deserves a better tribute than this third-rate book."
2,My Sister Tommie,"This books lacked a lot of luster. Ms.Ludie Montgomery was invasive. The only information that everyone probability didn't know about and that was the information regarding James Brown being so abusive to Tammi. She repeats herself numerous times, and the book seems to focus more on Tammi's sister and her depression. Maybe this is a book about healing. The pictures were horrible - xerox and poor quality. I'm sure more pictures could have been located at the Motown archives, that could have been used in this memoir."
4,"Good, but flawed","This is an easy read and I found myself crying at the end. As a wee child, I wanted to be the Tammi Terrell that I saw on my aunt's album cover. Since this is the only book I've seen about her, I have nothing to compare it to. The sister does get some years mixed up and doesn't know an awful lot about her sister's life. Actually, no one she interviewed did. The photos could have been better. I did find myself disgusted by James Brown and David Ruffin, men who felt that need to beat Tammi. All in all, I enjoyed the book and it stays on my mind. One wonders if she had gone to a doctor as a teen, her condition could have been altered. So many questions, some answered. Decent book. By the way, I downloaded Tammi and Marvin's songs. Sorry. It was Tammi as the main vocalist, not Valarie. As a musician, I know the difference."
1,My Sister Tommy The Real Tammi Terrell,"Although I was excited to find a book that was suppose to give insight about Tammy Terrell. This book was the worst 24.99+ shipping I have ever spent! There is no meat in this book, no details. I don't feel as thought anything was revealed. Yes she had a relationship with David Ruffin, James Brown and Marvin Gaye but where is the intimacy with those relationships. What made those men so abusive. In discussing it reads James met Tammy, Tammy sang with James, James was in Tammy's bed, James Beat Tammy Now Mother had to get Tammy. What was the relationship like. It reads the same way for the Ruffin relationship. People say nice things about her and there is the different names each person knew her by. SO WHAT. The pictures were nice. I became interested in her after watching the Temptations movie. There was just as much description about her in that movie as was this book. I would not recommend this book and I am truly sorry I spent the money on it."
2,Can I get a refund,"This book was a waste of my time. While it had moments that touched me and gave me a decent peak into TT's life, there was very little that made this feel like the ""whole"" story. I need to read the pages that were left out."
2,disapointed,i thought this book was very poorly written and not an honest account of terrell's life or work.
5,Thank YOu,When i read the reviews of this book i was kind of woried but once i picked it up i could put it down i loved it it really does show the real tammi terrell her sister should be proud of it. my favorite part of the book was the end when a friend of tammi's said that the last thing that she said to her was take care of david meaning david ruffin i think this speaks a lot about the on going love they had even after they broke up. wonderful read.
3,pretty good,"Overall it was a good read. Some of the things were already seen on Unsung but I liked the pics, they should've been in color though."
4,I wish she was still here,"I really enjoyed this book. I was 8 years old when she passed. My brother has the ""Irresitble"" album and I thought she was a pretty girl. ""Ain't no mountain high enough"" was the beginning of a successful, but brief career. Due to illness, she left us too soon. I recommend this book to all lovers of the classic ""Motown"" sound!"
5,Sound choice has the BEST Quality karaoke tracks in my opinion!!!,"This listing is for a brand new Sound Choice Spotlight Series Specialty Karaoke CDG (SC8109). This top of the line CD comes sealed in a heavy plastic jewel case, plays the music without the lead vocals and displays the lyrics on a Karaoke CD&G; player.

3,"Historically important, not very captivating.","This memoir of the relationship between Novalyne Price and Robert Ervin Howard is a fine historical document. It does have its moments of humor, pathos, and insight. However, it's not a very entertaining book, and one can see why Mrs. Ellis (Novalyne's married name)never became a professional author (until this book). I'm glad I bought it and read it, but principally for its historical significance into the life of Robert E. Howard, one of the 20th Century's finest writers of adventure fiction. ONE WHO WALKS ALONE was made into the excellent flim, THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD, starring Vincent Donofrio as Howard, and Renee' Zellwegger as Price. A case in which a film was better and more effective than the book.Still and all, I do highly recommend ONE WHO WALKED ALONE. It's a fairly good read, and does give a great deal of insight into the strange life of Robert Ervin Howard."
5,"NOT JUST A NOVEL, IS A PERSONAL JOURNAL.","THIS IS DEFINETLY NOT JUST A NOVEL, IT'S MORE THAN THAT, IT'S DEFINETLY THE NOVALYNE'S PERSONAL JOURNAL, WHEN YOU READ THE BOOK YOU JUST FEEL THAT YOU'RE PART OF IT. YOU CAN SHARE, LAUGH, CRY THOSE DEEP AND PERSONAL MOMENTS BETWEEN NOVALYNE AND ""BOB"". IF YOU SAW THE MOVIE THEN YOU JUST SAW A TINY PART OF THOSE REAL MOMENTS. THIS BOOK IS FULL OF DETAILS, IT TAKES OUT OF THIS PRESENT WORLD AND TRANSPORTS YOU WAY BACK TO THE 30'S IN AN INSTANT."
5,Wonderful book,I never thought I'd be buying a book about the man who wrote Conan the Barbarian but after seeing the movie I wanted to read about Robert Howard and Novalyne. It's definitely a book I will re-read and I'm proud to have it in my bookcase.
2,Not White's best. . .,"As a child, I loved The Tower of Geburah and the Iron Sceptre, and later on found the Sword Bearer and really enjoyed that,too. White's Gaal is one of the best Christ figures I've come across, right up there with Aslan. Which is why this book came as a bit of a disappointment. The encounters with Gaal/the Changer weren't nearly as powerful in this story as they were in the preceding novels. (Although here and there Eleanor's descriptions to John of Gaal seem to pack a little of the usual zing)Also, Gaal's self sacrificial death (and much of the journeying John and Eleanor do through the enchanted forest) is so heavy-handedly symbolic as to short circuit any empathy on the part of the reader. I'm afraid I stuck this one out for mostly sentimental reasons."
5,An Awesome book for C. S. Lewis fans,Gaal the Conqueror is an amazing book. It is an allegory that is very creatively written. The part about Gaal on the altar represents that Jesus died for us on the cross and the wine of free pardon is amazingly like the unconditional forgivess of the Lord Jesus. I recommend the entire Archives of Anthropos series to any fantasy buff or Narnia fan.
1,"too academic, no idea of real business in China","The author seems to have no idea of real practical management and intercultural issues of China today. Moreover he uses a very academic, abstract way to explain his quiet strange assumtions how to handle management issues in China."
2,"kis love it, we think it's terrible!!!","We got this pool in June, set it up on what we thought was level ground.It started to tipping to one side, it got pretty bad so we drained it. Had someone come over and level the ground looked great and we filled it AGAIN! Not 2 days later it was tipping again. This time was horrible. So we drained it and I called the company and explained what was going on. They sent us a new pool because it looked like the pool had a defect to us.So we got the new one filled it................My husband said NEVER AGAIN!Kids love it, we think it's terrible!"
5,From Back Cover,"The first season of Geisters: Fractions of the Earth comes to a close with Dobias on the brink of civil war, the Shirou history revealed and the Geisters in tatters.The Geisters were formed as an elite fighting force to protect Dobias from its enemies, but exactly who Dobias' enemies are is not as clear as it should be. There is a power struggle in the house of Juno that could determine the fate of the Geisters and Dobias itself. As Alcion's past continues to haunt his present, Victor's allegiance is called into question. Shai and Dean are on their own in the Shirou stronghold and Cris has emerged as the bedrock of the Geisters. Can they all survive and if they do will they ever be a team again?Political intrugue crashes head on with SciFi action in Vol.3 of Geisters: Fractions of the Earth"
3,Not really worth it,"I bought this to combat a caterpillar infestation on some yellow broom bushes. For some reason this plant is like crack to caterpillars. After covering the plants several times with the Dipel dust and no real decrease in the crawlers, I resorted to old fashioned hand picking just like I do for the horned tomato worms. At the end of the day, its a big mess, your plants are covered in white powder and it just doesn't seem to be worth the hassle."
4,Good vise for the price.,"After reading numerous reports on all the vises I could find on Amazon I was a bit worried..... I didn't need to be. This is a well built, simple, clean, and easy to use basic vise for anything you need to do. The cut and fit of the unit is as good as any other on the market or possibly even a tad bit better. It has good clean well fitted faces(unlike some of the other reports and reviews) with enough room to add wood face plates and still have room for a reasonable sized piece to hold and work on. I received mine in very good time with no shipping damage or problem of any kind!It does not offer the fast / quick release and all that, but if that is not what you are looking for, it will most everything else you could want. Simple, clean, not fancy, but it has all the good basics in place."
1,low quality hat and terrible customer service,"I had the misfortune of accidentally clicking ""Buy this item with one click"" and was charged $20 for the hat with shipping charges. This is definitely not worth the money. I would consider paying $8, but that's it. I contacted the seller to cancel my order prior to the shipping notification. My request was ignored until the shipped it the following day. Definitely one of the worst sellers I've come across on Amazon. They were not going to reimburse me for shipping and charge me 25% restocking fee for a hat. I asked what for and they said it's a fee for all the trouble of going through their inventory and packing it up. So basically I was forced to keep the hat or would have been out $20 with nothing to show for it.Avoid them at all cost."
5,Veterinary Dentistry: Principles and Practice,"Most of the dentistry texts that you will find here are too general to be helpful in advancing your knowledge of dentistry. This text was recommended to me by a board certified veterinary dentist as a way to learn the etiology and the ""why"" eveything is done as it is. If you are at that place where you are learning more advanced procedures and techniques but you need some good knowledge to pair with your new skills, this is probably the text with which to start. There are also other texts here from the AVDS reading list but this is a great general text."
2,Clunky,"These mitts are huge and stiff. I think they may be dangerous to use because it is hard to get a grip on anything. They do work for keeping from getting burned, but my old cotton mitts are what I still use instead of the silicone ones. If they come out with a better design-better fit with more control-I'll buy the new improved."
2,Don't bother,"This was the first of this author's books I've read. I don't think I'll bother with any others. The characters were not deep enough and the editing was terrible. There were so many inconsistencies and flaws I wonder if an editor ever really read it. If I didn't know better I would have though that this was written by some first-time writer, not an established author. To say I was disappointed is an understatement."
3,a whisper of eternity,i read and collect a lot of paranormal books..and while this was not the best it was also not the worst..i kept it to read againbecause i knew that i would not mind doing so...frnimay
1,Truly terrible,"I'd love to see more reviews about the actual book instead of being critical of the readers reviews...anyhoo...I'm afraid I was bored to tears, I skimmed it, hated the characters and lack of anything significant occurring in between the pages. I'm afraid to try any other titles from this author, I won't be duped again!"
1,Quick! Save your money!,"I gave this book one star because there is not an option for zero stars. Actually, this one would go into the negatives for me. The only thing that forced me to finish it was the fact that it was SO bad, it was funny. From the synopsis on the back of the book, you'd think there'd be a plot. Sorry. No plot. The characters are characatures at best. No one is interesting or believable. The book seemed an excuse for the author to talk about how much she loves ""The Phantom of the Opera"" musical and Caesars Palace in Vegas. The epilogue is a one and a half page wrap-up that lets you know everyone lived happily ever after. I wouldn't recommend this one to anybody. I can't believe it was actually published. I feel like writing to the author and the publisher to ask for my $6.50 back."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the book. The plot was predictable and sometimes unbelieveable. Throughtout the book the main characterter resisted being turned into a vampire and yet she wasn't angry when it happened to her or her friend. This book could have been a lot better.
1,Eternally forgettable,"The vampire seeking through eternity for his reincarnated lover was an interesting concept but it's application here just didn't hold up to it's promise. I slogged through it till the end but now feel I shouldn't have bothered as I can barely remember any of the so-called plot even though I just recently finished reading it. The epilogue was the kind of improbable ""all tied up in pink bows"" ending that just makes a person want to grind their teeth together. I wish I'd read some of the reviews here before I put my money out. Take a pass on this one."
5,I absolutely adore this novel,"This is hands down my favorite book. I love it so much Ive read it far too many times too count and i still had to order another copy.The book came on time, perfectly wrapped in plastic and still held all the old magic from my pre-teens (age I first read it)A must read book for all ages. ESPECIALLY TEENS, ROMANCE LOVERS, and FANTASY LOVERS!"
1,Rubbish,"The Linux support is garbage, and the card is not capable of passing through S.M.A.R.T information about the disks when in JBOD mode... so you're either forced to use a different OS, or run a RAID without knowing when the array is degraded or a disk has failed, or use software-RAID but not being able to know in advance when a disk is about to die.There are better models out there from different vendors. I replaced this item with an LSI 9211-16e HBA and haven't looked back."
5,I love this album.,"I had first listened to Portugal. The Man on July 20th, 2007, 4 days before Church Mouth came out. Although it was hard to listen to all of their songs in 4 days before I saw them for the 2nd time on Church Mouth's debut, I'm glad I kept with it. This is one of my all-time favorite albums. Portugal. The Man is like no other band that I've ever listened to, although I think they go well with Radiohead and Circa Survive.I was really surprised when I listened to this album and all of the songs. I think that they are different but they aren't trying to be different. John Gourley has a very unique voice, I think that makes them stand out more but it's not in the 'oh look at me' way.If I could, I would buy this album all over again."
2,Ok.,"It's not bad, but after listening to their In the Mountain in the Cloud album first this honestly was a bit of a let down. Good, but didn't hit home as well."
5,phenominal album,"I was at a concert probably last february or march and i got handed a sampler cd for fearless records, and 2 portugal. the man songs were on there, 3. Stables & Chairs, 4. AKA M80 The Wolf I thought those songs were amazing in an original way and i played them about 500 times before i decided to buy the album...I did and its amazing... Very original.... especially vocals... 5 stars"
4,A good book for basketball fans,"I really enjoyed this book,it goes into Phils career as a player, both in college and the NBA, then it talks about his coaching days in the CBA and in the NBA with the Nets, Bulls, and Lakers. The last part of the book is my favorite it talks about his first season with the Lakers, the problems they had learning the triangle, and the conflicts between Kobe & Shaq. Charley also has a nice interview with Tex in one of the chapters. The book goes more into Phils time with the Lakers than the Bulls, but all basketball fans should enjoy this book. You also get a good idea of what kind of person Phil is."
5,"A Different Approach, But What Would You Expect","This book alternates between sections written from the differing perspectives of Phil Jackson and co-author Charley Rosen. Phil offers up his trademark candor about his teams and personal life, and Rosen produces what he always has: nicely written revelations about a range of topics that have intersected Jackson's life, from the CBA to longtime assistant coach Tex Winter. Roland Lazenby, author of Mindgames, Phil Jackson's Long Strange Journey"
3,A great book is in there somewhere,"This is a quick, fun read without a lot of depth. That is unfortunate, because the theme - an homage to Tex Winter's triangle offense as ""pure"" basketball - is worth exploring in depth. I enjoyed the book, but the sloppy editing, particularly in Phil's chapters, interfered with that enjoyment. If you haven't read ""Sacred Hoops,"" start there. If you like that one, this is a lesser, but still enjoyable sequel."
4,Hoopaholics In Love,"This book is basketball junkie paradise. As for me, whenever Charlie or Phil went into detail about the triangle, I had no idea what they were talking about. And hey, dig them squiggly-line charts in the back of the book!But otherwise the book is a relaxed, informal ""conversation"" between two old, very good buddies, sharing their beautiful obsession. It was sweet to gradually become aware of and then vicariously revel in the deep bond the two guys have, all from their passionate love of hoops and its people.Let the technicalities wash over you and enjoy."
2,Jarring,"Disconcerting and Jarring.The book alternates chapters (written by) Rosen and Jackson- which is jarring. You read a chapter, you get into the flow of the writing style, then, once you finish the chapter: BOOM. You run right into the brick wall- of another person writing.The chapters aren't even related. You can actually separate the Rosen and Jackson chapters into two book(let)s and comprehension would not have suffered.But then__ if you're a basketball fan, the Phil Jackson chapters are Gold. Or at least Silver. It'll be worth the read. (And the buy.)"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"My carpenter recently purchased this item and installed it for me on my side garage door. Product worked okay for the first few weeks, but then started making sporadic ""beeping"" noises. When this happened during the daytime, I wasn't too concerned. But when the loud beeps began coming several times during the night, that was it! I pried the unit off the door! Don't know if the problem was with the three button batteries or the unit itself. But I definitely won't buy this product again..."
5,Worth the Money,"Purchased three last week, delivered and installed this week end on mobile home in a college town.For the money, an excellent deterent to complete entry. I expect intruder would back off and try another target instead. Anyone inside would be well notified.I read the posted reviews, before making a purchase. I think someone commented that it wasn't as loud as expected... It's a relative thing I suppose. It met my expectations. Good product."
4,Great low cost option for wandering,I purchased this alarm on suggestion from my neighborhood security when my Dad wandered. This alarm is piercing and will make my Dad freeze in this tracks. A good tool for those with family members that wander. I give it 4 stars because the adhesive needed a little extra help. So not perfect but very good.
3,A Remote Control and Higher Decibal Output would of made this perfect.,"I bought this to use for my front door, when I leave for the weekend. Problem is you'll set off the alarm when you come in, causing the neighbors to hear the alarm and get desensitized. The alarm is quite small, about the size of a pack of cigarettes. It is very noisy but I wouldn't of minded it being bigger to get more sound. Installs very easily with sticker backs so you just have to stick it to the door. Little screw holes would of been a good idea, what if you have a very porous door and your alarm falls off because it didn't stick right?"
1,Didn't stick,I tried to use this on a wooden post and the adhesive would not stick. It may be OK on a metal or glass surface but it only lasted one day on wood.
5,Doberman Defender,"Dont waste your money. These are flimsy and poorly made. Did not last long, maybe worked for a few months and after the batteries were replaced never worked again."
5,"This is the ""bible"" on the subject.","Frankly, I am impressed with the extensive research, processing, and interpretStrange Fruit: Alchemy, Religion and Magical Foods: A Speculative Historyation that produced this encyclopedic work. An interesting, engaging writing style makes for smooth reading. After this work, there is little or no reason to research the subject again--except for curiousity, pleasure of re-rereading, or possible re-interpretation of a detail or two--since the subject has already been covered in this volume. Thanks for the highly readable information."
4,oh wow!,"I can't believe how scary this movie was and that i never heard of it! Did anyone elese notice that in the last tale, Heather (Jaleene something in real life) was in MTV's Real World?"
3,wow! what a scary movie this is,"""Campfire Tales"" really scared me which is very difficult for a movie to do. It's about a group of kids who tell scary stories around a campfire in the wilderness while they're is broken. The second story I thought was the most creepiest of them all and gave me nightmares. I highly recommend to all who read this review to go rent it."
1,This movie is not Da' bomb and a half!,"This movie starts out when a teenage boy and his friends are driving on a road telling a tale about a man with a hook. After the tale is over, the boy accidentily goes off the side of the road and crashes. Soon he and his friends build a campfire off the road and to pass the time by they tell scary stories. The stories include The Honeymoon, People can lick too, and (I sort of forgot the last tale because it was really boring). I don't recommend this movie because the tales are obvious. I gave it a 1 BEcause of the great effort put in to make it scary."
5,Let's Make S'mores!...,"After running off the road, four young people build a campfire in the ruins of an ancient church building. It's the perfect setting for them to spin three tales of terror. STORY #1- A couple on their honeymoon are attacked by an eeevil creature / demon / man. Can they survive their big night? STORY #2- A little girl is stalked by a lunatic, adult male ""friend"" that she met on the internet. Things get ugly when the girl's parents go out for the evening, and the babysitting, older sister takes off! Guess who pays a visit? STORY #3- A man on a motorcycle winds up at a remote farmhouse inhabited by a beautiful woman. His dreams soon turn into nightmares when the horrible truth is revealed! CAMPFIRE TALES is a solid entry in the horror anthology category. It's one of my favorites... P.S.- Nice wrap-around story to boot..."
2,cheesy horror flick,"I dont know why they made this pile but it stunk beans. only the story with Glenn Quinn and the headless girl saved this one from being a total shame, because Glenn Quinn rocks and may he rest in peace"
4,A VERY GOOD HORROR MOVIE!!!,"THIS MOVIE HAD A FEW STORIES BROUGHT TOGETHER IN ONE MOVIE. IT WAS SPOOKY AT TIMES AND IT WAS VERY ENTERTAINING. IF YOU LIKE A SPOOKY MOVIE IN THE STYLE OF TALES FROM THE CRYPT OR NIGHT GALLERY, THEN CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!!!!"
4,three spooky tales,"This film was about 4 teenagers that broke down in the middle of nowhere at night. They built a campfire in the middle of the woods located by an old church. (the film has NOTHING to do with the old church at all) and they tell 3 tales. The first one, when a young couple goes on a honeymoon and then this guy warns them about the ""thing"" that comes out on a full moon. Of coarse, you'll have to watch to see what happens. The second one was about a young 12 year old girl which gives her name online and a guy tracks her down and she thinks its a girl named Jessie. The title of this one is odd, I think. ""People can Lick too"" you'll see. the last one is about a charm and this girl that cant speak in the house. The ending of this whole film is dumb. I dont really like it. It could of been better."
4,Cheesy horror at its best!,"Horror ""fans"" who like cheesy flicks like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" and ""Scream,"" will enjoy ""Campfire Tales."" The stories in this package are nerving and unearthly. I'd have to agree that the story about the girl on the Internet is, according to me and so many others, simply the best. Chuck full of suspense and ghostly images, ""Campfire Tales"" is a winner. However, I was dissapointed that James Marsden was in the movie for only a few minutes. He is inexplicably cute. (Note: Other movies with James Marsden: Gossip, Disturbing Behavior, X-MEN.) Regardless, ""Campfire Tales"" is a must-see for any ""fan"" of the horror genre. Get ready to jump and scream. If all else fails, watch it with a boy/girlfriend, someone with whom you can cuddle.P.S ~ I wouldn't have written this review if I wasn't positive and forthright about the eerie and unforgettable scenes in this movie. You be the judge!"
4,Surprise chiller!,"First saw this on late night cable and thought it would be another boring and predictable trilogy. I was caught off guard by the first two stories. One makes you never want to own a camper, the other makes you want to stay out of Internet chat rooms. Grab the popcorn and enjoy!"
3,Campfire Tales,"Ok, This movie has a few scarry parts, but not many. Really the only reason that I watched this movie was so I could see (James Marsden), but he was only in the beginning for like 2 mins. Most of the rest of the movie was pretty corny. The second story was kind of freaky though. You can watch this movie if you want but unless you scare really easy you might not like it!!"
2,"Sloppy, very sloppy","I don't know what you saw in this movie, but from what I know, the plot is very badly put together. Let's see, a group of young people total their car and then tell ghost stories waiting for the police in the ruins of a church. I don't know WHAT you saw in this movie at all. Sure I have to admit its scary, but otherwise, why was this done?I didn't see all of it, but I saw enough of it to convince me it was badly put together.The one good part was the Internet stalker. It did actually carry some morale for chatroom yackers.The rest of it. OK, here's the third story: A guy has his motorcycle conk out and goes to this haunted house where this colonial chick resides. She doesn't say much until the end (why was she mute anyway? Doesn't make sense). When the two get away, there is some melodramatic element that had no reason to exist but just to freak people out.As for the end. Why? Was that plot twist REALLY necessary? It was thrown in at the last second I SWEAR!"
2,way too cheesy to be scary,I found this movie alltogether way to weird. It was stupid and entirely too cheesy. The second story was the only one that made my skin crawl.
4,Under rated.,"Four teenagers crash their car and wait around for help, while waiting they deside to build a small fire and tell some horror stories. Story one involves a newly wedded couple driving around in a big camper van and break down in the middle of no where, during the night they start to hear strange noises. Story 2 involves a young girl who is staying home on her own one night, not knowing that someone is prowling around the house. Story 3 involes a man who stops off at a farm and meets a young girl who can't talk and seems to have some hidden secrets. Campfire Tales is a movie that most people would ignore but they shouldn't, it's a great and creepy movie. It's hard to talk about the stories because they are so short. I was so suprised about how creepy the movie was, the second story was probably the creepiest story of the lot. It's hard to go into detail about this movie but trust me it's gory, creepy and fun."
3,"Campy, but scary","Sort of predictable, but I think pretty good for when it was released. Remember telling my youngest the story about the newlyweds when we were swapping scary stories once."
5,Campfire Tales,"Did not expect to be this good without any Brand name stars. Nice approach of telling a tale, very entertaining and impressive ending."
5,So Humble,"All of Brennan Manning's books inspire me. The Lion and The Lamb is a must read for any one who is feeling down on him or herself. Relentless Tenderness, yes that is how Jesus loves us - enough to die for us. Can't beat that."
5,Settlers vs. Pioneers,"Amazing book. Typical Manning. All about grace. All about God's relentless pursuit of us. Amazing way of helping me realize that all that's required of me is to simply receive. The settlers vs. pioneers illustration is one of the strongest windows of the world and the church. I read this close to reading Radical, by David Platt. I saw a lot of comparisons."
5,A Fierce and Gentle Love,"This is an amzing book that has really made me question things. Why do we believe what we believe about Christ? I truly believe that if we are seeking to know Jesus Christ with all of our hearts that he will not let us harbor false images and thoughts of him. That's what this book showed me. The love that Jesus has for us is so much more than we can understand. He is so gentle with us, like a lamb, but, like a lion, he will chase us down to reveal himself to us."
4,Phantom Punch,"Sondre's fourth album ""Phantom Punch"" is just that: punchy. It's way more upbeat and frenetic and LOUD than his previous work. It's especially LOUDER than the superb Duper Sessions, which I absolutely loved.His softer singer/songwriter style that was on display in his first two albums still shines through on a few tracks. Thankfully, his very distinct voice is there throughout.But, be warned, this is a bit of a departure from his previous efforts. That said, it's still way better than 90% of the other CD's you could be buying. I'm not a fan of the louder Sondre, but it grows on me with each repeat listening. He's still a superb, relatively unknown, artist."
5,phantom punch,I loved this album from the moment I first played it. The tunes are catchy and the lyrics are nice. Definitely cemented me as a Sondre Lerche fan.
2,Not his best. . .,"I love Sondre Lerche. He's one of my favorite artists, but I just don't find this album to be as charming as Faces Down, Two Way Monologue, or Dan in Real Life."
1,Low rating is due to the miniscule print,"I had never seen the actual book before purchasing it through Amazon. I cannot speak as to how well I thought that the story was presented, because I could not read it without a magniying glass. The print is that small. I have never read it."
4,"A different kind of story, interesting for adults and teens",Child of the Wild Wind really held my attention. Lots of good issues addressed without being didactic. Characters I could relate to easily. I wanted to find out what was going to happen next. It's clear Claire knows what she is writing about. Very interesting to read about life in an intentional community. I'm sending a copy to my daughter-in-law who's a high school special ed teacher.
2,Noisey,"Compression/sustain wise, this unit is decent but I cannot abide the noise ... I tolerated it for a while but wound up pulling it for a cleaner compressor ..."
1,Not good for pet rats,"I have 2 pet rats and they chewed right through this within days. Then again, it is called a ferret hammock. BUT, in the product description it says it is good for other critters too. So, naturally, I was disappointed."
3,Decent,"I bought the Hammock for my three pet rats, and it is a nice size, but they don't like to sleep in it. All they do is chew it up. They prefer the tunnel type of hammock much better."
4,Came with my cage.,"I have to say that when I opened up the box with my cage and saw this hammock I thought for sure that I would need to buy him a new one that was much softer. However, even though it doesn't seem soft and it is thin.. my ferret took a great liking to it.He used it just as much as everything else in his cage. So for the price and durability I would say that it is a good deal and ferrets if the ferret likes is then I am happy."
3,not as advertised,"I just got mine, and wasn't to happy that it didn't have fleece like the pic showed. It's a good product, it's just not what was advertised. I probably would have chosen another product if I would have known!"
2,Not what was shown in photo,"I ordered this for my kittens, they love it anyway but the one in the photo has fleece and the one I received didn't have it. Since I needed it right away to keep my foster kittens happy I kept it but I know the fleece one is nicer and better for them. One other note, I know it shows for Ferrets but I use it for kittens and within two weeks they had this broken. I have seen Ferrets at play and so wonder if they are just as hard on these as my kittens. They really need to re-enforce the straps for anything that might chew on it. Still if you want a temporary toy and fun thing for your pets this might do but just remember it is only good for a short period of time."
2,Sadly chew-able by rats,"My rat was very interested in his new hammock. So interested that it kept chewing at the support straps. If your animal doesn't like to chew on fabric, I suppose it would work out well, but if not, look into steel reinforcement. Mine lasted about a half an hour."
2,Photo is misleading,"I like the product, but I ordered it thinking it was fleece lined as the picture shows. I was bummed to get a thin piece of material without any warmth for my hairless rat. Oh well..."
1,False advertisment,I ordered this product because of the picture. The hammock looked thick and blue. The hammock I received was thin and bright pink with polka-dots !!! Why not just show a picture of a Ferarri maybe you can fool even more people into ordering this product.
1,RUN AWAY.,"very cheaply made, some kind of thin plastic material. Does not look comfy by any means, I wouldn't let my ferrets sleep on it if I was PAID to. Don't waste your money on this product, invest in a good 15 dollar fleece hammock with a snuggle cover, they are longer lasting and much more rewarding for your cuddly critter"
2,Terribly remastered.,"This CD has some nice tracks by Honey& The Bees, Viola Willis, Little Helen, The Quiet Elegance and others- the remastering job is plain horrible, though. Most tracks were transferred from vinyl with no attemt made at cleaning up the sound (some have very scratchy sound quality)."
4,really good,"Really good. Darkstalkers has pretty much has been a favorite game series of mine for a long time, so this was a treat for me. My only complaints is that I wish they made an anime based on the third game (I am a big Lilith fan) and that this series had too much scenes of Donavon (not one of my favorite characters). But other than that, I really enjoyed this."
2,More of the same,"This is the 6th or 7th Marcia Lynn McClure book that I have read. Unfortunately, I have to say that I was disappointed after reading this one. Marcia's books are all starting to look the same--the names are different but the people and inner conflicts are the same. Does the lead male always have to be incredibly good looking? Does the lead female always have gorgeous and completely ignorant of it? What about the story lines being all to similar? The main inner conflict in her books revolves around the female being insecure in her love--""how could he possibly ever love me"". This was ok in the first several books, but finally enough is enough. .On a positive note--I do appreciate her books being clean and smut-free."
4,Visions of Ransom Lake,"Relaxing, uncomplicated romance. I have enjoyed all of MLM books even though they have their cheesy moments. I am getting a little bored with the ""he'll never love me even though he's kissing me passionately over and over"" thought process that the women in a few of these books have had but I'm sure I will pick up another of her books when I'm in the mood for a simple, light and clean romance."
3,"I liked it, as I am a fan of Marcia Lynn McClure but I did not love it.","It was a good story and the H was very troubled. I just kept thinking, that had he been more honest the whole issues would not have happened. Also Vaden was somewhat childish. It was hard for me to belive Ransom real could have feelings for such an immature girl."
3,.........,ok i cant give this a 5 because it was very different from the TV series and OVA 1 and 2 as many people have heard miaka and taka do get married and probably ya'll have heard about that girl who takes the Universe of the 4 gods and becomes the suzaku no miko ((i cant remember her name bad memory))now the thing that got me mad was that Taka nor chichiri or tasuki actually didnt listen to her they went to find the reborn celestial warriors......then taka actually goes with her though he has a perfect excuse since otherwise Miaka would stay unconcious 4 ever and the girl would have the baby and not Miaka since when the girl became the suzaku no miko Miaka became unconcious and until she came back from the book miaka would stay like that so basically that girl has all the power over the suzaku warriors
5,VERY GOOD!!!!,"It's just like the regular series and OVA except more funnier and action.My fave episode is episode #3,where Nuriko reincarnated and fights(playful way)with Tasuki."
4,Gwa...It continues.,"Good...yet...neh...I really don't know what to say.Okay, well, it is a good continuation to the wonderful series, but I mainly got this for the pencil boards. (I luv Tasuki!)I like Fushigi Yuugi, but it does drag from time to time (well, a lot of the time) and you really have to stomache getting to this part in the series. I nearly stopped when my favorite character died in the series.I suppose I can say...this series is slightly complicated and twisted in its own ways. [Twisted is good.]This ova kinda contridicts my view of how it should be, but hey I accept all versions of how it could be.Oh, yeah...this ova will make NO sense whatsoever if you haven't watched the TV series (all 52 episodes), the first OVA (3 episodes), and the 2nd OVA (6 episodes--I believe; I don't own that yet).So, as most of my favorite animes, this one is lengthy and you have to be willing to stick with it."
3,WHY?,"Fushigi Yugi is a wonderful anime series. The ending of the series was just right. The good guys defeated the bad guys and the lovers stayed together. The story is over, everyone is happy. Eikoden is completely unnecessary. It makes you think that The Universe of Four Gods is a neverending cycle from which the main heroes will never be able to escape. They might as well make a follow up on this one too. Episode 52 of the original series should've been the end of it."
2,Ugg...,"Cell animation has a showdown with evil CG versions of the four gods! How exciting! or not... I think that perhaps the producers of this OVA were a little intoxicated. The usual FY characters are placed in a story that shoots by so fast it forgets to let the viewer in on what has happened. To top it off the memorable characters from the series are all overshadowed by the disgusting lead, Mayo. I am also very disappointed by the crappy CG animations of the four gods.On the upside, the animation is a signifigant step up from the panning shots of the rest of the series. Tasuki and Chichiri make the show as usual, you know! Without their banter this anime would be a total waste of time, you know!I would not recommend this as the first FY you watch. If you're a fan of the series though, knock yourself out!"
1,"Wow, Watase should have just stopped while she was ahead.","Wow. That's all I can really say. If the plot of Eikoden got any weaker...oh wait, that's probably not possible. The series was awesome, the second and first OVA's were pretty good, too. But Eikoden managed to take every single character in it and ruin it. It was actually pretty painful to watch, especially since I enjoyed the series. But, at least she didn't screw up Keisuke."
3,Needs to stop...,"In all fairness, the story has a good idea behind it. But it just kind of bored me. There are too many plot holes, which leaves too much room for questions. And I'm sorry, but my love for Miaka's character just made it seem like it was missing even more when they left her in the coma. And Mayo's character is just so depressing...it's like watching Yui's original character all over again. Please! Yui got my sympathy, but I just wanted to smack Mayo. I loved the original series, and that's really where the story needed to end. Words can't express just how exasperated I feel after having just watched this. Good story, but it would have been best if it had stayed in written format and not brought to creation. I gave it three stars for effort, but I honestly won't waste my time to watch it again, unlike the original series, which I have watched a good 10 times. If you have to see this, then I recommend finding a video store and renting it. Don't waste your money on buying it."
2,Terrible copy,I should have listened to the review about this book. The print in the book is terrible; can't make out some of the words. I am not sure why it comes in a large book form because the writing is small with lots of wasted space on each page. I am disappointed in the quality. It's interesting to read what the dreams mean; that is if you can read the print.
3,Not a great effort.,"This cd is spotty at best. All in all, a wise-acre approach, with lots of emphasis on silliness and goofiness. Sounds like they threw this one together, which is a shame, as these guys can really play - they get the 3 stars for musicianship. Gave Poised in Hate 5 stars, that's the one to go for!"
3,Very good book on one piece flow and mfg. cell layout,"This book contains a great deal of very useful information on creating, or revising, manufacturing cells to reduce waste and improve productivity. The book contains a cogent explanation of the advantages of replacing batch processing with one piece flow processes. It is particularly good at describing how to improve production floor layouts to reduce the number of workers needed to manufacture products while introducing one piece flow. The information is there, but the text could be much clearer. A valuable addition to Shigeo Shingo's books on manufacturing."
5,"Fascinating, well-written mystery","Earl Staggs does a super nice job on Memory of a Murder. He kept me glued to the book until the wee hours of the morning. Smooth writing, excellent plot and well-developed characters kept me engaged and guessing until the very end. Staggs lays out clues that keep you hooked and trying to figure out who did it. And I found the whole topic of remote viewing of great interest. I have no problem recommending this read."
4,NEEDS TO BE RE-MASTERED IN HD ALONG WITH FOOTAGE THAT GOT LEFT OUT!,"Well it does lack real production...and editing was pretty bad...it would be nice if they would re-master it in HD if possible? and include the rest of the footage .... strange on the audio CD you got ""porpoise song"" sung by Mickey, but it was never on the DVD? also ""look out here comes tomorrow was never on the CD...I guess that was the marketing deal to make you buy the CD as well.anyway hope they re-package it and give us the real deal that it deserves! They really should be in the rock n roll hall of fame as well...just for what they did."
4,Lots of Fun!,"If you're a Monkees fan, you'll love this! The Monkees are as entertaining and uplifting as ever -- great songs, great singing, comedy, and more. Buy it!"
4,Best moments were left out,"The footage on this DVD is excellent, but unfortunately not aimed toward the hard-core Monkee fan. I think the producers missed the point. The Monkees made this tour mostly about those fans who have been with them for the long haul. They played the songs we'd all been dying to hear like ""Shades Of Gray"". The DVD only includes the group's mainstream songs which I thought was a big mistake. Also, there was almost none of the banter that goes on between the guys between songs. Those are the things we really wanted to see. I'm happy to have this DVD to jog my memory of the three times I saw this tour, but I'm dissapointed in the production overall."
3,Expected much more,"If you're a fan of the fellows consider this DVD a must-own as it is quite possibly the last perfomance by the 3 of them. As mentioned on other reviews Peter quit-was dismissed right after this show. My wife and I were present at this performance and so much was lost in the editing. I missed the brilliant ""Monkees Overture"" and Micky's show stopping ""Since I Fell For You"" spot. I can't understand why so much was cut out. Also odd is the fact that there are no photos of the guys on the cover. At any rate, it is a good overview of the hits and some idea of what the reunion tours were like. The video quality is good (not outstanding) and the 5.1 audio gets the job done. Too bad they didn't just release the unedited version of the show as they really blew the doors off this time."
2,Not really worth the price,"I bought both the verb and adjective pack of cards. At first I thought they would be a great way to review vocabulary, then I realized that is not how I learn. Talking to others in my Japanese class I find that none of them find flash cards to be very effective in learning new words. I ended up writing all of these on a sheet of paper, and going over that over and over until I had committed all to memory (not so difficult really). The flash cards worked okay for review after, but were not really necessary. Just write down 50 to 100 vocabulary words on a piece of paper and then commit these to memory -- you don't really need these cards. Plus the verb cards use romaji (yuck!) along with kanji. What they really need is kanji with furigana."
5,Easy study,These little cards are a great help while I study. Because they are little you can put them in your pocket and take them with you. The rings keep you from losing them. Now if I could only manage to remember them!!
1,Differing Perspective,"In D'este's biographyPatton: a Genius for Warhe tells that Patton went to France during the first World War and was a commander of the first American tank group. This is much different from Porch's statement that Patton was a late comer to tanks. Porch also claims that Patton mostly failed in Africa but D'este's perspective is that Patton managed to turn around 100,000 men from losers into a cohesive fighting force that actually gained ground rather than losing it.There are a number of other areas with respect to Patton where Porch seems way off the mark. Porch seems to be singing the same song made popular by the movie which is based on a book by General Bradley, one of Patton's harshest critices -- mostly because Patton made Bradley look like the idiot that he was.In you really want to know what happened in Africa with Patton, read D'este's book. Porch is telling fibs."
1,Get an Editor,"This is a great idea stillborn. I wanted to love this book. I find the Mediterranean of World War II fascinating. An attempt to tie it all together, the personalities, the enviroment, and the asymmetric forces engaged. What an enthralling idea. In this case it is an overwhelming one.Uneven writing,technical errors and manhanding facts to support the thesis are all present to combine in an irritating muddle. The assorted head scratchers and eyebrow raisers will get you reviewing your library. Serving to remind you of all the really good books waiting to be distilled into that omnibus that this only presages."
4,Desmond's,"I've been looking for this show for years, it was my favorite show in the early 90's, but I struck out everywhere. The show is hilarious."
5,very long search is over,I watched this show when it was on and have search for it off and on for years. I forgot the name of the show but tonight (03/16/09) a commerical mentioned British comedy so I did a British comedy search and I found it. My search is over and I will be able to watch the show whenever I want.
5,Desmond's a well missed show,"I have seen desmond's on Bet awhile back and fell in love with the show. me and my mom used to tape it every chance we got but when it stoppped showing on cable, we used to just watch the VHS tapes that we recorded. But when someone told me to check here for it on DVD, I was suprised that they had it.So if your into a good British comedy with a Caribbean flavor to it, Get this DVD...I can't wait until the next series come out"
4,The best british caribbean sitcom ever,You will love watching this DVD collection of Desmond at his best. Best british comdedy ever
5,Great Pattern Book,"This is a great fly pattern book. I would recommend it to an experienced fly tier. Since there are not any tying instructions with these patterns, a novice tier could be overwhelmed. But overall, an excellent book!"
1,I expected really more,Up to me a book called fly pattern Encyclopedia can't miss most famous patterns. Many of the flies differs only slightly in colors and seems to be tyed to amaze and catch fishermen more than fish.
5,A Life Transforming Tool for Churches,"In May 2004 I visited Sheffield, England with a handful of church leaders led by Dr. Kent Hunter and organized through the Church Growth Center, based on Walt Kallestad's recommendation. Over dinner in an English pub, Mike Breen and his wife explained the Lifeshapes concept and a bit of the local church history. I was preparing to launch a new mission congregation and I was sure that I wanted to incorporate much of the model that Mike had developed. I came home with passion and a folder full of notes, but I lacked some key pieces for explaining Lifeshapes to others. This book will change your life, if you apply the lessons learned. Together with the Passionate Church companion book, ministry leaders will have the requisite tools to make this model accessible to the innumerable churches in desperate need of a new way to function healthily. Plus, you save the cost of transatlantic airfare!Thank you Mike and Walt (and Kent)!"
1,Misleading,"I ordered this product, thinking I was going to get the feeder and all as discribed, and all I recieved was the nectar. I would not recomment this seller. Buyer beware!"
4,one of the best flavored and some good heat!!!,"one of my top 5 favs, it's a good one!!! you will not be dissapointed if you like habanero peppers!!! not the hottest but 6 out 10 for heat"
5,"Roy Rogers VHS Tape, Vol. 1",Wonderful!!! Just what I have been looking for -- my Father died last year and my Mother cannot watch any of the movies they used to watch together. Roy Rogers brings back happy memories of her childhood - it is just terrific to have this on VHS tape for her as she never mastered the DVD transition.
3,pretty okay for the $,"This item is pretty good except for the ""special"" storage space under the snap on pillow. If you don't put something in that opening, well, you can guess the comfort issue then. A plain, junior size air mattress without the ""secret storage compartment"" is much more practical. Maybe much younger kids (under 7?) would like it, but mine were unimpressed. The overall quality, however, was like Coleman in general."
5,Great Reeds!,I have had more luck with the Vandoren reeds than with any others I have used. Would highly recommend them.
3,Fabulous power - but along the wrong axis,"Neodymium-Iron-Boron rare earth magnet: 1/4 cylinder... Unfortunately, the north and south poles are through a *diameter* of the cylinder. This means you cannot put two of them on a wire or thin rod and have them ""float"". Instead they will spin, align north to south and south to north at the circumference, and snap together. The result is a long ""rod"" of magnets. This makes them stick to the fridge better, and since there is a hole, you could put a loop of string through it. But these are not so great for those ""perpetual motion"" machines you know you are thinking about right now."
5,Gift recipient was extremely well pleased.,Am pleased recipient liked OXO extremely well.--John K. Meyer
2,Not the quality I expected...,"The outer casing is flimsy and there were a few ""kinks"" in the cable due to the inferior outer casing. This was not the quality I expected and would not purchase. You get what you pay for and the low price of this cable should be an indication of the quality which it is."
3,Not quite what I wanted,"It's a fairly nice scope, but I was hoping to use it with a camera attachment. Unfortunately, Nikon's nomenclature for camera attachments and scopes is pretty hard to figure out, and calling them was a phone-menu safari.I had to return my scope and get a refund, minus restocking fee.I would rate this about 4 stars for use on it's own."
1,Chinese Weapons,I found this book to be very much worthless. It contains brief (and sketchy) descriptions of the weapons used in ancient china. It provides very rudementary sketches to help explain the weapons but nothing to really describe them. The book is somewhat short and contains some of the more odd chinese weapons (the mechanical weapons). I would not recommend the book to anyone.
4,A Case of Lone Star,I bought this book for my twin brother. He was so happy that I found it and that he can add it to his collection of rare well written mystery novels!
5,nice weight,This is a nice satin finished stainless steel with a comfortable grip handle. The ladle is a nice size. Has a nice weight to it. I have my cooking utencils out and so appearence is important and this is very attractive as well as practical.
4,Laura G.,"Product behaves well. A little floppy compared to the Scotch 3 mil and slightly, very slightly yellowed in finished look compared to the Scotch laminating sheets gloss. But, for the price, I will order these again!"
3,3 stars for the first movie only,"The Hidden is a decent B-flick that is worth renting. It is somewhat of a rip from the body snatchers but it has it's own story. The acting and plot for the most part is not oscar winning but then most B-movies aren't to be taken seriously and this one shouldn't be taken seriously either. Regardless, it is entertaining. The odd behavior of Kyle MacLachlan's character keeps you guessing what will happen next. Now after seeing this movie I expected that there would be a sequel and of course there is. The Hidden II takes place 15 years after the first one but the movie overall is just not good. If you see the Hidden and enjoy it, chances are you will want to see the sequel but trust me, you won't like it as much. As most direct to video films go, the Hidden II suffers from a weak script and is too short. As for the DVD, the Hidden has a few features which are good but the Hidden II has no features to speak of which is typical for lame sequels."
2,the hidden not bad for it's time,"Ok I bought this because of reviews of others who said it was ""a hidden gem"" possibly a play on words.Anyhow I watched one and two and have come to the conclusion that had I watched this in back when it first came out it probably would've made more of an impression on me. If you want the story line read the other reviews, but for my part I can easily say I watched both once and that's it not doing it again. The story for the first is actually not bad and defenitely watchable the second movie only slighty less so but once watched I can't justify wanting to see it again."
2,Poorly made,"These are not well made and will last about two months. But if you like that, they aren't terrible. I washed mine a few times and the started to unravel at the seams."
4,great shower exfoliator,"I like these shower mitts. The one side is a nice exfoliator, but the soft side is nice for your face. This doesn't lather as well as a puff, but it exfoliates much better."
1,Not Recommended,"NOT RECOMMENED!Don't waste your money on this extremely over priced, poorly and cheaply made, poor fitting piece of burlap.I'm sure you've heard of highway robbery, WELL! This is nothing more than Internet on-line shopping robbery!Unfortunately, I can't give this product less than a 1 star rating."
4,Heartbreak,"In Cardcaptor Sakura: Vol. 12 - Final Judgement, our young heroine has her heart broken. Viewers' hearts will break along with her. This DVD contains the last three episodes of the second season of the show.The first two episodes on the disc are intense, dark, and a bit violent. Kereberos reveals to Sakura that although she has captured all of the Clow Cards, there is one final step to determine if she will be the cards' master. Yue the Judge must arrive and make the final decision. Who Yue really is, and what this means for Sakura, is unbearable. Sakura must battle with Yue for her life - but how can she - when her reason to live has been taken away?The last episode gives us a glimpse of the third season. We have a new character, a British exchange student named Eriol. He is suave and intelligent, and seems to have taken a liking to Sakura, which agitates Li Shaoran."
5,good PPV,"We have the firs ppv of kurt angle.Kurt angle vs Samoa joe-tha match of the nigh, even a little short but is priceless...Great PPV men, buy it, recomended"
3,Room for Improvement,"I passed this exam today. While this book was helpful and covered most every exam objective in sufficient depth, it needs some work. For God's sake, when will somebody create an MCSD book that doesn't have a glaring error in every chapter? From wrongly keyed practice tests to glaring contradictions, this book had it all. Case in point, pp.126-127 ""(the controls) collection is not a true Visual Basic Collection because it does not support the full member set that a Visual Basic Collection object has. However, it does have a COUNT property, as well as ITEM, ADD, and REMOVE methods."" Umm...that's what a VB collection has. The content (when it was correct) was sufficient, but the book was soured by such errors. Did I mention get the Transcenders?"
2,I wish I had used the MCSD in a Nutshell book,"I spent about a week before the exam plowing through this book. It tries to be light in some places, but mostly it just lists the information and doesn't give you much sense of why it's interesting or useful. (And VB is so overloaded with stuff that most of what's covered on the exam isn't useful to most developers.) It was a decent study guide, and I passed the test just barely, but I definitely wouldn't recommend this book to anyone else. Check out O'Reilly's MCSD in a Nutshell, which you'll read quicker and remember more. (If I had known that book existed, I never would have bought this one.)Good luck on your test!"
3,Hire a proofreader!,"This book may have very good topics in it but you constantly have to check to make sure the information is correct. It appears that the author is a fan of cut and paste and does not bother to edit the text after pasting. Therefore you get a bunch of incorrect information.Maybe it is a way for the author to constantly test the reader to see if they are paying attention but, I doubt it."
2,vague explanations... still could pass exam,"yeah i still passed exam. didn't like the book much. the facts are not explained to the point. lot of pages with no content. i would recommend to study an exam cram, and msdn too to be confident for the exam."

4,It DOES Work!,"While not a ""miracle"" cream, after 3+ weeks' use with the Night Cream and Renew & Restore, my skin is definitely smoother & clearer. I'll keep buying & using it."
1,A Big Disappointment,"This is about Freight lines only. It is slow and boring, plus the disc would seem to stop, then start going again. All in all, not the best spent money. I am planning a trip, and ordered it thinking it would give me some ideas of what to look for on my upcoming trip. I couldn't get past 15 minutes, it was so boring."
4,Shelock Holmes found the hound (get it?),"This was a really good book and the story of the hound's legend makes it cooler. Sherlock Holmes thought of everything to solve the mystery. I don't quite remember how each and every character is connected, but the overall setup, mystery, and explanation behind everything is very good."
4,The Big Mastiff,"Despite I didn't received the Hound of Baskervilles yet, but I hope that item will be as much as splendid as was the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - boxed set collection, I mean the quality.Roberto"
5,Blow'n things up,"I bought this to serve as a trigger(after modifying it),on a 4.5mm-stainlessS delivery system. I filed/cut-off most of the body,used tap&die to thread the modified attachment points. Works well."
3,Track Listing,Track Listing1. All By Myself (album version) 5:122. Pour Que Tu M'Aime Encore (live) 4 :383. Je Sais Pas (live) 4 :264. River Deep Mountain High (live) 3:28
4,Great Collection,This is a great collection of the last 4 movies in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. You'd pay double the price trying to buy these movies individually and they'd take up more space. Get this collection. You won't be disappointed.
2,Ok.......,DVD came quick but the second disk was cracked in the center. It managed to play in my DVD player but not sure how long the life will last.
2,Not many favorites in this pack...,"Getting straight to it, this is a weak bundle. Nightmare on Elm Street 5: Dream Child and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare are the weakest of the series along with part 2 which was Freddy's Revenge. Freddy vs. Jason is a mixed bag. It's interesting seeing these two horror icons duke it out, but that may or may not be your cup of tea. The strongest is New Nightmare which brought Heather Lagenkamp as Nancy back into the franchise and offered a new twist rather than more of the same. I would say buy that one on its own and pass on this quad set. It's nice that they put these packs together for people on a budget and sometimes all or at least 3 of the films are pretty good. But not in this case."
5,"""Super Savings, Super Films""","Simply one of the greatest horror franchises in Hollywood history this set contains the last four films of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"". The movies are ""Nightmare on Elm Street-The Dream Child"", ""Freddy's Dead-The Final Nightmare"", ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" and finally ""Freddy vs. Jason"".All the films come with their own individual discs, but the four are piled on top of one another and are snapped and housed into a hard center lock. Still, be careful when handling the DVD's as they can get scratched easily.A remarkable price, your getting the last four films for the price of one.The movies also come with their individual trailers."
1,"Useless Triband, might as well have only GSM 1900","This phone is advertised as a tri band phone. But the three bands that are supported are GSM850, GSM1900 and GSM1800. There is no GSM900 which is used all over the world except the USA. This phone thus can only be used inside the US only.The GSM850 and GSM1800 are useless bands, the 850 is used at very few places in USA and the 1800 is used some places in Scandinavia. But those places have GSM900 also.Any true international phone has to have at least GSM900 and GSM1900. Actually these two bands are enough. This phone boasts tri bands and only one band is useful, what is the rationale for this.Another big thing missing from this phone is the Bluetooth. Bluetooth is now considered as a must have feature in any decent mobile phone.SonyErricson goofs up again."
1,Sony Ericsson Z500a,"The following review is for the Sony Ericsson Z500a, and has been composed by one or more person(s):The Sony Ericsson is only a good phone for those who do not plan to spend very much time on their cell phone. This particular phone by Sony Ericsson, is definitely not their best! The maximum time this phone will hold the charge is approx. one hour. Therefore, if you intend to purchase this phone you might want to invest in a car charger also.If you are buying this phone because of the camera feature, it is highly advised you try a different phone. As they say you get what you pay for and this is a very cheap phone with little value to wireless communicators.This phone has, on more than one occasion and with more than one person, shut off and/or malfunctioned for no apparent reason. The overall rate for this phone is a stunning 61.3%*!*This percentage was obtained from an online source."
2,It's super ugly!,"I had this phone for 2 days before I decided to return it. The main reason was because of the size. It's gotta be the biggest phone, by far, that Cingular offers. I know a lot of people like big phones, but I swear this phone was designed for Shaq. The phone is also the ugliest phone that Cingular has. It's really fat and it has an internal antenna, which some people like, but I personally think it hurts the looks of the phone. I also found the ""click"" noise the phone made everytime I opened it annoying.The phone does have some pretty good features that I guess will appeal to a lot of people. It has EDGE for data, but I'm to poor to afford going online on my phone. It also has a 500+ space phone book, but I am a loner and I don't know that many people so that doesn't affect me either. In the end, I traded it for a Samsung E317 which I think has a better camera and screen."
2,Picture Quality is REAL BAD !!!,"I bought this cell phone because I am from JAPAN and expected the same quality as Japanese advanced technologies in this cell phone.The picture quality is real bad. You can't choose or edit the photo much. If you are sensitive for visual, I don't recommend this phone at all."
3,Need more improvements in some basic features,Pros :Packed with lot of features.Cons:1. The screen is unreadable in sunlight.2. Even though it is weighs just over 3 ounces but looks bulky.3. Cheap look like dollar shop toy.4. No data cable provided to sync with Outlook.5. Very limited themes and ring tones.
2,Don't do It,"I own this phone. I dropped it one time in the four month's that I have owned it and the screen is blue. That's why I'm on Amazon now looking for a replacement. Of course I didn't have insurance on it. However, I've never had to have insurance on any of my other phones and I dropped them a thousand times. If you don't plan on getting insurance than don't get this phone. It won't last a good six months."
4,z500a,"This phone is ok, for my standards, but could be a little better. I like the camera,(and video camera). That is a great feature for this phone. And, unlike some other phones, you can have unlimited recordings. Overall, it has many great features..except for one feature, that is the best.FREE RINGTONES!!!If you go to entertainment, and then choose sound recorder, record your favorite song, save it, then go to settings, ring tone, and on the list is Memo 1, or whatever you savedd it as."
3,there are better phones out there,this has been one of my least favorite phones. as people have noted:ringtones aren't loud enoughthe screen is not bright enoughthe volume when speaking is not loud enoughthe charging cords (home and car) are tempermentalthe quality of pictures is poor even by phone standardsand lastly the most annoying thing to me is the short battery life.try finding yourself a samsung with the features you like and you'll probably be happier with your purchase.
2,This phone has a short life,"This phone is alright. My battery charges quickly and stays charged for longer than any other phone I have had. The camera works well and has some fun features. The speakerphone works well. However, the screen on this phone sucks. At first it would just have a dark blue tint over it and the tint would come and go. Now half of my screen is dark blue and the other half fades in and out. I have had it for just over six months. Everyone that I have talked to with this phone has had similar experiences with the screen. I do not recommend this phone to anyone for this reason. Also, ever since I first got this phone, the outer screen looks as if there is dust under the cover. Additionally, the phone is rather large compared to other picture phones."
2,Poor Quality,"This phone was amazing when I got it. I've had it for about a year and I'm waiting for the day to get rid of it. The faceplate that is supposed to be ""easy to change"" is a tad bit too easy to change. It falls off almost every time I use the phone. It also has a problem with freezing. Every so often, the phone decides to not work and either switches off or on or decides to stop working and won't turn off leaving me no option but to remove the battery. The camera isn't great. I've gotten decent pictures from it though. The games are dissappointing because all of them on my phone are demos and allow very little game time. Ringtones for this phone are horrible. None of them are decent. I've also found that on some days, the phone decides to just not ring. The only positive thing I've found about this phone is it's speakerphone function."
3,an ok phone,"well... the phone is a good one for a kid it has all the features that a kid would want. camrea is average, no digital camrea though. it is very thik and bulky though.easy 2 use. gets great service in oklahoma. takes a long time to connect a call"
2,Hate it,I hate this phone.I had it for 2 months and the screens broke on it the speaker you could barly here the person on the other line. I just switched to the motorola razor v3 and i love it.but anyways the batterydies within 8hours(when fully charged). Cingular wireless is good but i didnt like this phone
1,I Hate This Phone,I Recently Bought The s710a Because This One Sucks I Will Tell You Why The Camera Is Awful Quality Reception Is Bad Extremely Thick For A Flip Phone I Can Understand My New Phone The S710A But This A Flip Phone Not One Of Them 1999 Phones Ringtones Are Very Bad Sound Quality On The s710a I Have A Mp3 Player But Here Nothing I Talked To The People At The Cingular Store They Said This Is The Best Phone Bulls**t That Is Why I Bought The Faboulus S710A
1,Z500a is a Great phone,"Design: A clamshell phone. Good for those with big fingers. Not to small and not to big. Has an internal Antenna.Features: A good buy for its price. It includes so many features. It includes a Media Player, CAmera wiht the ability to record as long as it has memory. It has fast internet for a Small phones thanks to EDGE. It can Fit manny Ringtones. The Games looks great. And its capable of running 3D games. And Messaging is a breese with T9 software, and with Sony Ericssons Quickshare.Battery Life: THe battery life is average for its size. It has a talk time of about 4 1/2 hours and a standby times of 250 hours.Call Quality: Call quality is awesome. Compared to many of my other Cingular Phones this phone has clear calls. And when im driving i can understand what people are saying.Overall: This phone is amazing. This phones manages to put so manny features onto a cheap phones. This phones has a very good price range."
2,I do NOT like this phone,"What other reviewers have said about this phone is true. The screen appears washed out, the phone feels like it's made of cheap cheap plastic, and it makes an annoying clicking sound every time you open and close the phone. And it's bulky. And the buttons are hard to press. Cool features, but a lame phone. I returned mine. I used to have a Samsung VGA 1000. So I'm going to try to Samsung P777 slider phone."
2,Music Reading for Guitar by David Oakes,"It is hard for me to believe that with a subject like reading music where being able to read rhythms is the MOST IMPORTANT aspect that gives musicians especially guitar players the most trouble, That there is NO CD for this so students can HEAR what the notation they are reading SOUNDS like!!!!!!!!!!!Someone could make a fortune if they did a book like that. This is just another book of how the notes and rhythms look on paper and how to count them. But How they SOUND, the most important element is missing.........like almost all books of this type!What a Shame!"
4,Usefull,"A lot of useful tips. Learned easily tricks and tips I didn't know. Recommended.However, I think a metronom is needed."
5,what a book!,"this book has helped me get up and going really fast, it a lot of rhythm compared to chord music"
3,Has ups and downs,"This book covers rhythms and counting in a very detailed way. Very steady progress. Starts with the 5th position, which is a nice surprise. It talks about song forms, and how to handle weird notations like ""coda"" as well. It has nice mostly classical tunes to learn (like Pachabel's Cannon).The things that lack are enough attention to key signatures, and any treatment of chords. This book has exercises in different keys but it jumps all over the place, without ample attention given to each key. And, every single exercise is a single note exercise.If you are looking for a more serious study on reading and guitar (pick style with chords), I suggest Leavitt's modern method. If you are OK with single notes, and do not have the time to go thru Leavitt, then I definitely suggest this book."
2,Buy the REI brand travel towels instead!,"This towel is literally like a piece of paper towel or guaze. The REI line of travel towels are much more comfortable and soft and still are quick dry. I returned this product to Amazon after taking it out of the package, it was not what I expected at all."
3,Beware of Size Issue,"Beware of this item if you want a regular size towel. I ordered the item assuming it was the same size as other pack towels. It turns out that the company makes four sizes of this towel and when you place an order for this item, you get the smallest one: 9"" X 12"". It's a great product, but they don't give you the ability to order the size you want."
3,Okay Packtowl,"The towel works well, it is small about the size of a wash cloth. The size makes it very handy for hiking. It is very absorbent, but takes a while to dry. When both fully wet, my wife's Large REI MultiTowel dried in a 4th of the time."
3,"Good overview of MPEG-2, but lacks technical depth","The books provides a reasonable overview of technical principles associated with MPEG-2, but it lacks technical depth. The treatment of audio compressions (an essential component of MPEG) is very terse."
5,Western Pack Newport Bag,"This is a great bag. Very durable as very functionable. I like the 5"" base on the bottom. The straps are long enough for you to slip your elbows through them. The zipper runs smooth. Well made bag."
3,Only half as good as the original,"This board book ends with letters falling down from the tree, but doesn't include my 2-year old son's favorite part of the original book -- the letters dusting themselves off, the rise of the full moon and A's valiant attempt to scale the tree again. Even for babies I'd recommend the paper book over the board book"
3,Not one of my favorites,This book is okay. I really didn't find that it's all that fun to read and my son doesn't care for it much at 14 mo old. It's pretty much just the alphabet. Maybe he will appreciate it when he's a little older and is learning the alphabet.
3,Inferior to the full length version,"I bought this recently for my 6 month old. I am familiar with the full length Chicka Chicka Boom Boom and read it often in to my Kindergarten students. While the ABC version is ok, it certainly lacks the rollicking rhyming fun of the original. I plan to transition to the ""real thing"" as soon as my son is old enough to stop eating his books!"
2,Chicka review,"Was in good shape, just disappointed that it was not the whole book!It stopped at the part my granddaughter loves best!Was bummed"
2,Love the original,I recently purchased the original and my children ages 3 and 4 both love this. I was confused when I saw a little boy reading the book on Blues Clues and noticed it didn't go all the way to the end I remembered. I was worried that the book I bought would not be the full story and am glad to find that there are two books! It all makes sense now.. thanks for the reviews!
2,Disappointment,"This is not the entire Chicka Chicka story, the board book is only half of the original story."
2,Nothing great!,The graphics (or pictures) in this book aren't really clear - too abstract for a baby to follow. My little guy has no interest in this one at all!
5,Wonderful for baby,"I have a 3 month old son, and he loves this book. He loves the bright illustrations and pages (I can tell from the intense staring and drooling!). It is a quick read, and takes less than 5 minutes to get through, which is perfect for his very short attention span. It introduces him to letters in a fun and bright way as well. It may not be the full version, but it's the perfect length for a baby."
2,doesn't flow,"I heard this was a great book, but it was disappointing. There's no flow to this book at all. I kind of felt like it was missing something. . . I now realize that there's another version that is more complete. I do not recommend this board book at all. Honestly, not even for babies. Just because it's a sturdy board book to chew on isn't a good enough reason for me!"
2,Not like the original one,"I had really liked the original version of this book which is meant for slightly older children. So I got this for my 14 month old daughter. She is least interested in it although she loves books and has many favorites. I didnt like it much either. There is no rhythm and the text doesnt flow very well. In fact, the last few pages just contain a bunch of alphabets thrown in as if in a hurry to finish the book. There are better books out there!"
4,Fun with ABC's,This is a fun way for kids to learn their ABC's. My mom reads this to her preschool classroom and they absolutly love it. She said she gets a better response out of them when she reads them Chicka Chicka Boom Boom then when they just sing their ABC's. I think it is easier to remember things when we make it fun and Chicka Chicka Boom Boom makes learning your ABC's fun.
2,Chicka chicka 123,"I should have read the other reviews! I was very disappointed to find this was only half the book. My 2 1/2 year old grandson loves the copy we have at our house (complete story), and I wanted to get him one to take on a road trip, and then keep at home."
3,Very Colorful Book!!!!!!,"It took me awhile to like this book. While the pictures are very colorful and bold, there just didn't seem like there was alot of substance to this book text - wise.The more I have read it to my toddler, the more she seems to like it. I think this is just one of those books that takes awhile to grow on you."
2,Not the full version,"My daughter (1 y.o.) loves the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom book. Unfortunately, she loves tearing at the pages even more. So we bought the board book version.Sadly, the story cuts off half way through. This is only Part I. And, really, the more amusing stuff (Black-eyed P, for example), are in the second half."
3,"Nice book, but not hardcover","I ordered this book for my son. He is a huge fan of the Chicka-Chicka-Boom-Boom books. I already had the softcover and board book, but thought it would be nice to get a hardcover one. I ordered this (under the impression that it was hardcover - the book says hardcover) and it came a board book!! I was so disappointed!! I never would have ordered it if I would have known it was a board book (since I already have it). That being said, if you don't mind it being a board book, this is a great book.This book is also a shortened version of the paperback. It only goes through the alphabet once. When the alphabet letters fall out of the tree, the book is finished. They don't climb back up in the tree. My son still loves it though. Very colorful and playful. A blast for a child"
2,Very upset,I bought this book a few years ago for my older kids and they love this story so I wanted to share it with my Babys now I was very disapointed I paid alot more for it and then only half the story is there
3,Smaller and Lesser pages than expected.,"I requested an expedited delivery of this book for my child's 3rd Bday since she was crazily in love with the youtube versions of this book.However,the book is not complete,it does not have the last 2 pages which my little girl loves ""after the alphabets fall..the sun goes down and the moon comes up ...etc."" My little girl was dissapointed . The book also appears to be smaller than the version we see on the net . My mistake for not checking the dimension of the book prior to purchasing."
5,Great Book,My daughter loves this book. It's a fun book and she enjoys us singing it out with her and making all kinds of sounds.
1,Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean,DVD will not play in dvd player or in the dvd format on my pc. Have tried all possible trouble shooting but the DVD will not play.
5,Life & Times of Judge Roy Bean,I've been looking for this many years & it was better than the first time I saw it 30 years ago.
3,Slightly Disappointed,"It was good to see Victoria Principal in her movie debut, and Newmann is certainly at his best as Judge Roy Bean. But I was disappointed that there was some content edited out for ""political correctness"" such as the Judge's famous death sentence speech. It was a letdown to those who remember the original masterpiece."
5,The most surrealist film of John Huston!,"Once upon a time in Texas a roguish Judge :Roy Bean magnificent acted by Paul Newman . And also a weird preacher : Anthony Perkins and an albino gunman named Stacy Keach .Blend this cocktail and you will obtain a clever, ironic and unencumbered film winking to Luis Buñuel.Watch this hidden and treasured movie ."
1,hollywood and star power,this film simply blends hollywood action and star power with about an inch of plot.roy bean was a fascinating man with a fascinating history neither of which the filmcomes close to capturing. it is a highly fictionalized account. can't believe paul newmantook this script.
2,love the movie . . .hate the presentation,"video was horrible . . .audio wasn't real bad . . .won't be buying any more of your movies . . .i thought it was a bargain , compared to the asking price of a disc . . .boy was i fooled . . ."
5,The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean,"One of the finest of all films in the ""Western"" spoof genre.A truly great original."
2,Left Me Cold,"I really don't share the enthusiastic opinion of most of the reviewers. This movie just didn't do much for me. It didn't seem like it knew what it really wanted to be. It was neither entertaining nor absorbing. It tried offly hard to be cute, but I didn't think it was cute, just cloying. The women had good performances, the men seemed forced except maybe Roddy McDowell. I didn't care for Newman's performance at all. The script had a few nice touches, otherwise it was a 1 star."
4,Surprised me!,"When I first saw the title of this book, I assumed it was a book somehow connected to my favorite author, Laura Ingalls Wilder. It is not, but I proceeded to read it anyway because it was about frontier life and the trials of living in a hostile environment. The title comes from a small patch of Walnut trees which are planted beside a newly built church in this growing town. It is the story of a family and the changes and traumas they go through as the children get older. It is a pleasing read for any pioneer-era fan."
5,Folding Cane,The strength of the cane is great and it lasts years. I have several. It really increases my ability to move around and makes traveling much easier.
4,"Yummy, but expensive...","Very good cookies, however not many for the money. The waffle cookies seemed somewhat stale."
4,Good cookies!,"They were all good. But beware, they come in many many small packages, each small cookie is packaged. Was not expecting that. To eat 1 small cookie, you have to open a small package. I did not care for the packaging. I spend too much time opening packages just to eat a small cookie."
1,SUFFOCATION RISK,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM B/C BABIES DO LOVE THE TAGS ON THINGS BUT THIS EVENING MY 4 MONTH OLD ALMOST SUFFOCATED BECAUSE OF IT! I LOOKED OVER TO HER SITTING ON THE HER BOUNCY SEAT TO FIND THE 12 X 12 BLANKET COMPLETELY OVER HER FACE AND HEARD HER GASPING FOR AIR! I RUSHED OVER TO HER AND THANK GOD SHE WAS AND IS OK! I JUST WENT ON THE TAGGIES WEBSITE TO FIND THE BLANKET IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES AND IS APPROVED BY JMPA, TIA AND ICPHSO. I AM SURE MY BABY IS NOT THE FIRST TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN AND I WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING THIS ITEM FOR A BABY DESPITE IT BEING RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES. THIS ALSO GOES TO SHOW THAT EVEN THOUGH AN ITEM IS APPROVED BY VARIOUS SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS, THAT MAY NOT MEAN THE ITEM IS IN FACT SAFE."
2,ok,has a few good tracks but production is kind of weak.... kind of a bone stock hip-hop album but worth it if you can get it cheap
2,Akrobatik falls short,"Don't get me wrong- I am a fan of Akrobatik. Ak has an amazing voice, flow, and lyrical ability BUT he came up way short on this full length release. I was not only dissapointed...but BORED. Production was lazy [not live] and Ak more or less came up short on the lyrical side. If you are wanting your fill of Akrobatik I would suggest- The Perceptionists 'Black Dialogue' album [with Mr. Lif and Fakts One] rather than 'Balance'. Also peep 'Ruff Enuff', 'Battle Royale', and his tracks with Lif."
3,The Cd Hype was better than the disc itself,Not very impressed with this one I might say.. a few decent beats many decent rhymes but overall... I'd have rather had a burned copy than pay for this one. Sorry Akro...
5,Awesome album,I haven't heard of Akrobatik until recently and I just got this album. I thought it was great and I can't believe I haven't heard of this guy before. It's difficult to find good hip hop artists these days when all these no-talent clowns are being pumped up by the media. I think if you're a fan of Blackalicious or maybe even Michael Franti you ought to give this album a listen. I'll have to check out his other work since the other reviewers think it's a lot better than this.
4,Great Lyricist,"Get this album if you appreciate quality hip hop, total lyrical ability, and top-of-the-line flow."
4,Ak breaks bones!,"a really good album..promising artist..his flow is out of this world...a topical album...stretching from old school emcee battle raps, to the essence of time, to hypocritical behaviour..the bonus track is just [great]..."
3,"Good rhymes, but weak beats","This album could have been a lot better. Akro has some nice MC skills, but I was disappointed with the beats. The only exceptions are the songs: The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and Front Steps. But compare the tracks on ""Balance"" to his collaboration on the song Fly with Vast Aire on the Push Button Objects album ""Ghetto Blaster."" What a difference a good DJ makes!Lots of potential. Hopefully he will hook up with more skilled visionaries like Vast Aire and PBO next time."
3,A few issues with this stand,"First, I ordered the stand in mahogany but received it in black. Second, the stand initially leaked some kind of glue on the top-- I think where rubber is attached to the wood to prevent a laptop from sliding. I cleaned up the glue, more or less, and decided to keep the black stand. I like it okay, but for the money, I was kind of disappointed with these two issues. The stand itself is sturdy and much nicer than a plastic stand."
3,A look at Yale,"A well written study of Yale. Buckley questions whether or not academic freedom exists at Yale. It is an interesting look at what was going on at this well known institution back in the early 50's. One can only imagine ehat is going on in the current day. A must for a Yale grad, otherwise it is good reading, but not as compelling."
5,"Marry me, Robbie!","The true Southern gentleman - all man, and very manly without going over the top with testosterone. Robertson has once again created a character and plot that will stay with me for a long time."
2,Automotive EMC,"This book might be good for a person who has no clue of what is Automotive EMC, what is EMC, or/and EMC testing. This book touches many areas in EMC testing, but it lacks deepth and practical examples. It is a collection of many introductory articles around EMC - no orginality. Basically, the high price of the book does not match up to its content."
2,annoying interruptions about referrals,It was hard to concentrate on any story with all the interruptions. I didn't finish the book because of this.
3,MARTHA JANE CANNARY-----library book,"calamity jane-MARTHA JANE CANNARY-5/1/1852 to 8/2/1903.Frontierswoman,scout,performer and mule skinner.Lived a VeRyiNTERESTING life. She claimed? to know many famous people..But,she only did so after they died.Unlike ANNIE OAKLEY she did no roping,riding or shooting. She justtold stories on the stage.She was a DRUNK--she had 1 daughter thatwas given up. Wore mens pants and chewed tobacco.DIED of pneumonia.She did write a bio.....full of lies!bbp 63okc okretired"
5,Excellent biography,"I did not pick up this book because I was particularly interested in Calamity Jane. No, I was going to attend a presentation the author, James D. Mclaird, was giving to the National Outlaw-Lawmen Association meeting in Rapid City, South Dakota. I wanted to know what he would talk about. (His presentation was excellent, by the way.)I thoroughly enjoyed the book, especially the discussion of Calamity Jane's legend. And, not long afterward, I spotted an autobiographical pamphlet of Jane's on a table at a bookseller's. I grabbed it immediately. Fifteen bucks ... and autographed in the BACK, not the front. Ha ha! I'd like to have met Jane. I was pleased to meet James D. Mclaird, and I'm glad to have read this book! Highly recommended."
4,Very Well Researched,"McLaird gets high points from me for such thorough and painstaking research - he really gets down to separating fact from legend and it's enlightening. However, I would have liked to have seen more of what she actually did and less of what she didn't. All in all, a worthwhile read for fans of Martha Canary/Calamity Jane and those with an interest in old west history."
4,A Good Read for Students of Psychology & Sociology,"An anthropologist and father of an autistic child presents fascinating information on historical, cultural and personal aspects of autism spectrum disorders. Stories from parents in cultures very different from America, like Korea and India, are both interesting and sometimes shocking and heartrending--but the book finds positive progress to be the rule of the day in every place that autism has been recognized as a separate disorder from psychosis and mental retardation. Most moving are the author's own stories of his family. There is much in their experience that would be helpful to other families dealing with autism, if they encountered this book among the growing body of literature about, by, and for parents of autistic children."
1,What a waste of time,"Although I hold any parent who would celebrate their child in high esteem, this book is a big waste of time. Grinker attempts to set back the autism movement and nullify a significant body of scientific information purely based on his anthropological background.Here's a thought - celebrate individuals based on who they are. Treat disorders based on what they are. People aren't labels. All autistics are not Grinker's daughter - The genetic diversity seen in autism alone demonstrates that very clearly.Parents - move on... There are great books on biomedical interventions to help children with developmental disorders, rather than ""celebrate"" their comorbidities, toxicities and impairments."
5,Progress for Autism Research,"As a scientist, I was so impressed that this book was able to integrate both an easy to read history of how autism emerged as a popular diagnosis, and a moving memoir. Thirty years ago all I knew of autism was what I heard about just one type of person, but this book shows the big range of autism. This is a book that will help parents to advocate for their children. It will help advance philanthropy. It will also help researchers because good research depends on a better understanding of autism. Fear and panic about a disorder don't produce sustained research programs. Data, knowledge, and accurate analysis and reporting does, however. This book offers much more. In the memoir portions, Grinker helps you to see the positive side of so many things we parents struggle with. Buy two or three because you will want to share the book with your friends, and with family members or teachers who just never seem to understand your child or what you are going through."
4,Mr.Capone-E is the shit,When I first heard this cd I knew that it would just as good as all of the other Capone-E cd's but this one was the best...I love every song on this cd I'm always bumpin to it from my house to the streets
2,Misleading channelling,"I have the highest regard for St Germaine, but not for this channelled version of his views. My particular gripe concerns the answer supposedly given by the Master to a question about homosexuality. This is, according to the channeller, down to the homosexual being frightened of a sexual relationship with someone of the other sex. Frankly, this is rubbish, and the channeller ought to know better. There is absolutely no way that St Germaine would ever wish something like this to reach publication. Unfortunately, it's in print. With any luck, those reading it will be of sufficient nowse to realise that it's completely misleading."
4,Soulmates and the Self,"I read the book and can recommend it to others who are either interested in St. Germain's teachings or enjoy esoteric material based on theosophical views in general. However, I didn't learn much new on the subject of soulmates. Basically the book says that once you have found your own Self, then you will attract your soulmate. When the yearning in you is no longer for an outer mate, but for the union with the Christ consciousness within yourself, then you will meet your soulmate in the physical form and the two of you will merge into one.The book has many more words on this subject, but as far as I'm concerned it boils down to these few lines. Once you know this, you might not want to read this book, but perhaps find another that talks more in-depth about soulmates. Otherwise the book also mentions colours, meditation, bodily changes, name changes, dolphins and whales and other topics briefly."
4,Nostalgic to a fault,"The complete Comet Empire series of Star Blazers is something I haven't seen in many, many years. It was a joy to be able to view it again in its entirety, but I was a bit disappointed when I discovered that the makers of the DVD did nothing to remaster the video or audio. So if you don't mind watching this in its fuzzy, muffled 1970's format, it'll be great.But make no mistake, the story is an amazing one and it's a joy to be able to see this series anytime I want."
2,Such a disappointment,"I just got the first episode of the Comet Empire series, and I was very disappointed. The Macrovision blocker bleeds into the ""regular"" picture. The sound is awful. It sounds like they taped it off an old tv broadcast and THEN transferred it onto DVD. After the first series was released, I was SO looking forward to seeing the second.The only reason I gave this 2 stars was for the sentimentality factor. It is great to see an old favorite. It's a shame the company who put this out didn't bother making this worth the $150 price tag."
4,"|t is great, but could improve a lot","After watch this again after 27 years I must say that the Comet Empire story does not get old at all. I've watched Star Blazers in brazilian tv about 27 years ago, and it still stands as one of the best sci-fi show I ever saw. Regarding the DVD, the dub is outstanding, but the sound quality is poor, video has not been remastered leaving scratchs all over the screen and the lack of english sub-titles make life miserable specially when characters are speaking under great stress (try Dr Sane lecture to Knox and Wildstar during their fighting). If you are still not convinced, what if you are impaired?...yes, english subtitles make sense, even in a english audio DVD."
3,Not enough of what you want or need,"This book promises a message of hope after an obscene crime is committed. The descriptions of the crime hit you at the beginning of the book, and as the mother of a young daughter, they haunt me vividly a month later. But the subsequent descriptions of ""heaven"" are not overly comforting or hopeful, nor do they provide any particular insight or conclusion. The other characters in the book were not overly compelling to me, and of course there's no justice in the end for the criminal. Finally, the resolution that the main character receives does not appear to me to be something worthy of supernatural feats.Don't get me wrong, I couldn't put this book down once I started it, but I just don't know if I'm glad I read it."
2,NOT GOOD,"I gave the author 2 stars because of legacy not for the content of this book. I don't know what happened with Angie Daniels when she wrote this book. She has Jay who can't committ to keeping his penis in his pants but he declares his love for Honey. Even when Honey and he get together, he stills says that even though he and the other girl has a baby together, he doesn't want his pensis to forget her. Also, why didn't Jay get a paternity test. He just assummed the baby was his. This rationale doesn't fit for the 21st Century where DNA is the deciding factor. This author had been one of my favors for years but with her last few books, I'm losing interest. I'll think long and hard before I purchase another one of her books or not at all."
2,When It Rains......a drawn out drizzle,"I have read so many of her books, and this had to be the worst one. If I had read this book before the others, I doubt if I would have pick up another of her books. I hope her next one is better. The foul language was so unnecessary, that it distracted me."
3,When It Rains was an okay read,"When it rains was okay. I have read one other book by Angie Daniels, In the Company of my Sisters and loved it. Honey got on my nerves from the first page. What was with all the foul language(not a prude)every other word out of her mouth was the F--- word. The ending makes you think there will be sequel, because Jay is still thinking about having sex with Kendra. I will read other books by her, just didn't like this book."
4,A strong and interesting story line...,Angie Daniels delivers a strong and interesting story line with characters that pop. Her language is intense and have your mate ready after you've read Daniels' steamy and enticing love scenes. Everything was well placed and I enjoyed how her sub-plots were ticked and tied to the end. If you want a contemporary romance that reaches slightly out of the box this is the book for you.
3,I'm confused!!!!,I'm a little confused. The language in the book didn't fit the female charaters(except for maybe Kendra) and the flow of the book. Also why was there a start of a story line for Natalia and than the author didn't finshed it. I didn't see the point. And at the end of the book after Jay had all this love for Honey and wanted to married her why was he glad Kendra was still going to be around for his manhood...he had Honey.This book was okay but could have been a lot better if the author had left out the piont mention above.
3,When it rains....it pours,"Honey Love is the beautiful owner of a successful upscale salon in downtown St. Louis. Her friends and family watch as men come and go in and out of Honey's life, most lasting no longer than a few weeks. Some think she's just finicky, while others view her revolving door of men as whorish. Unbeknownst to them all, Honey is suffering from a traumatic sexual assault in her teens. As a result, she won't let any man get close to her.Jay Andrews, a private investigator and former ladies man, unexpectedly found himself in love with his friend Honey. Despite her refusal to take their relationship to the next level, Jay is convinced he can make her see otherwise.Kendra is a determined woman. Determined to make Jay hers. And she's willing to use anything, including her unplanned pregnancy to get him.This was an okay read. It started off slow, but eventually picked up about mid-way through."
3,Just as good as it is bad,"Where to start.... Well I thought the book was about 100 pages too long. Honey and Jay both got on my nerve so bad at times I wanted her to be with Darius. Honey was too wishy-washy for me. It was very tragic about what happened to her, but she would just flash too much at times. I don't like how Natalie and Sterling were kind of just thrown in there. Maybe there is another book about them. I haven't had the pleasure of reading her first book intimate intentions. I didn't know this was a sequel when I picked it up. There was AN AWFUL LOT OF CURSING in this book. I have read 2 other books by Angie Daniels and this one is completely different. This is not a favorite of mine. There was too many twists and turns and so on. Hopefully the next book I pick up by this author will be different."
4,The recipes _are_ yummy!,"I received this book as a gift and have been very impressed. This book has been a useful resource in adding more calcium to my diet with its helpful hints and calcium tables. The Carrot Broccoli Cilantro Salad is one of my favorite recipes ever. The Chunky Corn Chowder is also great.I already loved the calcium-rich ingredients that this book relies on (dark leafy greens, tofu, almonds - to name a few) but the recipes are creative enough that they can hopefully win over those who do not.Many of the recipes take quite a bit of time to prepare. That is the primary reason that I do not use this cookbook more often. However, if you plan ahead you can prepare some of the ingredients while others are cooking to save time."
1,Leader's Guide doesn't match with contents of the book,"If you are looking for a leader's guide to match with ""The Gospel According to the Simpsons, Bigger and Possibly Even Better,"" then don't get this one; get the older one. This leader's guide doesn't review any of the episodes covered in the book; it discusses completely different material. This leader's guide may be great on its own, but it doesn't match with the book which is very disappointing to me."
3,amateurish,This was an excellent summary of a gay man's emotional development and it covers most aspect of the common experience of coming out. But I thought the writing far too amateurish to deserve the praise that this book has received. It was a very interesting first effort but lacked the intelligence of truly great literature.
4,Good first novel,"While not as good as his short stories, and awkward and somewhat amateurish in a few places, this is a good, strong first novel. Ideally I would give this one a 3.5, but since that's not an option, I'll err on the side of generosity. This novel explores coming out, family dynamics, and the selfish yuppie attitudes of the 80s."
5,A very good read,"I enjoyed this book, it's stlye and content very much. I cared about these charaters so much that I wanted more at the end of the story, I wanted to know what happened to each of them and to the relationships that had ended and begun. I am very much looking forward to reading more of Mr. Leavitt's work."
5,Feli citaciones a David por sus libros,"Soy un admirador mexicano de este autor,a pesar de haberle leido en traducción, es admirable su escritura, las historias y los personajes tan reales que se encuentran a la mano.Ojala y el autor lea mi comentario, me gustaria mucho escribirle para exponerele mis opinioes.Si todas las personas leyeran su obra, tendrían una opinión diferente de la homosexualidad."
2,"It's okay, but oddly inconsistent.","I love the Anthropos books, but this one was quite different in tone and writing style, and just doesn't feel like a part of the series. That, plus the fact that the allegory is just WAY too blatant in this one. Sorry John, love your other stuff, but I'm not too sure what you were thinking with this one."
1,Too Many Carbohydrates,"I was given this book during a diabetes education class. I'm sorry, but eating as many carbohydrates as this book recommends is not helpful to diabetics. If I ate one serving of most recipes, my blood glucose would shoot way up. I guess if you are looking to keep the pharmaceutical industry in business, this is a good way."
2,Unrealistic,"The recipes look great, but are unrealistic for the population I work with and the geographic area I am located in. I am in a small Mid-western community without access to alot of these food items. I have been able to use some of the recipes and love those recipes I have tried. Thanks for the great recommendation."
1,Get in the Zone instead,"I was VERY disappointed with this book. The Joslin quick and easy recipe book is great however. The healthy carb book is definately only for people who like thier meat still on the hoof. The recipes are unrealistic and I too, found the carb ratios are not what is recommended in the real world. I have better results keeping the Joslin bible in my head, but working with the Zone Cookbook. Be sure your dr agrees b4 you try this at home ;0"
4,Nice umbrella,"This appears to be a nice umbrella. Easy to assemble, looks like it will not fall apart and provides good coverage. I like the hand crank - operates smoothly as well. My only disappointment is with the string to hold the umbrella closed when not in use - it is not attached to the umbrella, which means it can get lost when the umbrella is in use."
2,poor packing,The umbrella arrived in very poor packing. The box was flimsy and the packing material was insufficient and poorly placed. Many of the loose items were out of the plastic bags and the ornamental top (made of plastic) had cracked in shipment.
2,Question on Parts,"The appearance is fine but they dent easily.Please tell me, Where or how can replacement parts be purchased for this item?"
4,Gets the job done,"We bought this for our front patio to block the sun to our front door. Although I was bummed to realize upon delivery that it didn't come with a stand like th picture shows(all other products don't show one in the picture) and it is very large in person, it is a solid umbrella that gets the job done."
4,Good Value...,"As long as you are not expecting something that is going to last 10 years, than you are good with this thing. I am thinking maybe 3 or maybe 4 years. What does that mean? It means it works great right out of the box, but you sort of get the feeling from the heft and the function that something will break after sitting in the elements in the summer time for 3 years. I am very happy with our unit though. Color goes with my siding and deck. And it does a great job of blocking out the sun...don't know what the spf would be but probably like at least 50. So, if you are a prime member and what a decent umbrella cheap...this is it."
5,great umbrella so far,"Have only used this umbrella for a little over a month, but so far the best umbrella that I've purchased. Have been through many wooden umbrellas with the pull string system, that didn't survive windy conditions or a storm, but this umbrella is awesome! I love the crank system, SO much easier to open than the pulleys. It also fell over on a windy night (table attached) & didn't break! I would definitely recommend."
4,Umbrella for the patio,"This is a nice sturdy umbrella for the patio. Probably will not withstand much wind, so should be closed up at night."
1,Poor quality pole,"While my umbrella looked good, the wood support pole cracked the week after it arrived. Following other's advice, I took it to the garage any time it was not in use in case a wind might damage it. I only raised the umbrella three times before I noticed a horizontal crack developing. It was a waste of my money."
2,Umbrella good. Shipping and service bad.,"I am happy with the umbrella. Looks good with my patio furniture and met my expectations based on other positive reviews. Apparent problem with shipping caused initial shipment to not arrive. I sent email to customer service when the shipment had not arrived 4 days past estimated delivery date and ""Tracking"" indicated it had not even been received by carrier. The response I got was worse than useless. Contained boilerplate message stating that everything was OK and I would receive product by estimated date (which was already 4 days past). Appeared the customer service rep did not even read my email and just hit button to respond. Used link on email response the have someone call me. Person on phone was very helpful and agreed that there was a problem with initial shipment and arranged for another umbrella to be shipped. I received the second shipment in one day."
2,cute but poorly made,"Aesthetically, this umbrella is just fine, and still looks good after 3 months of use so far. My problems with it: 1) The picture makes it look like a base comes with it. Nope- you have to purchase one separately, and there's no guidance on which type to get. Don't get the Verdi Gras cast iron stand, this umbrella is too thin to fit properly into it. So it leans a bit to the left. Not a huge deal.2) Whenever I crank it closed, it somehow manages to pinch and cut my hand, even if I'm trying to be careful3) If you're dumb enough, like me, to leave it open on a windy day, it blows over, taking your table and umbrella stand with it."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER!,Not bad but the writer repeats himself a lot. Would have been a lot better if he would have just stuck with the facts. Too much conjecture (I dont care what some fat writer thinks I just want the facts Ill make my own decision). Good enough for what it is but MEH...
4,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"ONE LAST CHANCE IS ABOUT THE 3RD COMEBACK BY FORMER NBA GREAT MICHAEL JORDAN. AFTER BEING AWAY FROM THE GAME FOR 3 YEARS, JORDAN RETURNS AT AGE 38 TO TRY AND TAKE THE WIZARDS TO THE PLAYOFFS. MJ HAD ALOT OF RUST AND MILEAGE ON HIM AS HE TRYS TO BE THE MAN ON THE WIZARDS. SOME NIGHTS HE WAS, BUT MOST HE WAS MEDICORE OR LOUSY. MJ LET HIS SUPERSIZE EGO TELL HIM THAT HE WAS STILL GOOD ENOUGHT TO COMPETE AND PLAY MOST OF THE GAME NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. BUT AGE AND A BAD KNEE DID HIM IN. THERE IS SOME INTERESTING STORIES IN THIS BOOK AND I DID LIKE IT. I KNOW JORDAN IS THE BEST GUARD I HAVE SEEN. THIS BOOK MAKES HIM HUMAN, BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT JORDAN THE PERSON IN THIS BOOK EXCEPT FOR HIS PASSION FOR BASKETBALL. IF YOU ALREADY KNOW ALOT ABOUT JORDAN'S PERSONAL LIFE THEN THIS IS A BOOK FOR YOU. THIS IS WHAT IT IS COVERING THE 2 YEARS HE TRIED A COMBACK."
1,Very very disappointing book,"This book looks like the author took some newspaper and magazine clips from others and cobbled them together in a sloppily written book devoid of insight. He has nothing of value here. And it's particularly disappointing that he would try writing a book about Jordan's comeback in Washington when it's obvious he spent little time, if any, traveling with the team during Jordan's Washington days. This book reeks of a clip-and-paste job. Don't waste your money."
4,"Decent ring, would be 5 stars if cheaper","The seller's photo of this ring is pretty bad. The ring actually looks better than that, but it still won't blow anybody away. The metal, while shinier than the stainless steel look in the photo, is still not that great, and the stone is ok looking and has a cute shape but even for CZ it doesn't seem to have that sparkly gleam. It's not a bad ring, but considering that you can get rings of similar quality for $10-$20, I can't give this 5 stars."
1,Psychology: Standard Deviants,I made the mistake of thinking this was an update to the much earlier tape...it is the same! I paid more for this small portion of the original tape than I did for the old VHS which includes all the material on three separate DVD's.I feel like I was ripped off but I made an assumption...my bad!
4,Handy nutrition reference book,"This book is a very useful, well organized nutrition reference that provides concise definitions across the spectrum of nutrition, including herbs and biochemistry. Most nutrition concepts are covered. I recommend it for anyone looking for a quick, comprehensive, accurate nutrition dictionary that is easy to understand."
5,Extremely Helpful,"I bought this text book for my college Business Communication class about 2 years ago. I love how it's well organized and very easy to understand. I still refer back to it whether to write a resume, to create power point slides, or how to write effective letters. It has helped me both professionally and personally. Highly recommend."
2,Borrow only!,"This book manages to do a lot of talking about very (VERY) simple things.The actual full body examples of different types of memos, letters, resumes and cover letters are helpful though.Because of this, if you need it for a class, I recommend simply borrowing a copy from someone else or renting it on [...]--avoid buying."
1,Mistakes over Mistakes,"Despite the fact that the book focuses on Business Communications, it still will not help students to achieve better communication skills (at least not with this issue). The book is full of logical and typological mistakes. Sorry but this will not work for a book that is trying to improve communication."
2,Not a very interesting read,"First if all this book has so many charachters with not so interesting lives that even after reading 300 of the about 700 pages I still was not drawn to continue. This was a book that 8 fellow friends tried to read and we all felt similar, one or two of us even shot to the end to see if there was anything groundbreaking that would make us want to continue. Sadly not. Of the 6 books we have read together so far this was the only stinker."
1,Plastic handle dried out,The plastic handle dried out and fell off. Irwin would not replace the snip unless the purchase receipt was sent to them. I did not have the receipt after two years. Sent them a picture instead. Way too much trouble to get a replacement from Irwin. Buy Craftsman instead.
5,my favorite snips,"i'm a professional carpenter and have done many many vinyl siding installations....100's in fact.these snips have always served me well and while they dont replace my ""wiss"" snips they are my main siding snips. i love the extra long cutting bladesi'll never be without a set if i can help it"
3,"Good, but not Mentallo good.","Mainesthai is the Dassing brothers of Mentallo & The Fixer plus Michael Greene as the vocalist. This album is okay. It has a sort of Skinny Puppy noisiness to it in parts, plus some guitar-oriented songs, and a lot of samples (""Hellraiser"", of course, is in there). Some of the songs run on for a bit longer than I would've cared for. ""Spectral"", ""Y"", and ""Wartime"" are its brighter moments. This should appeal to fans of Mentallo & The Fixer, Benestrophe, and Skinny Puppy."
1,Will not survive the 3rd day,"These cufflinks were made to last for only 3 days. The next day you try to put them on, they will just break on you. Very terrible welding ""welding over paint or something"" watch the pictures I took after they failed on me.Don't buy them if you want something that last more than 3 days."
3,The add says low in salt - but my taste buds say otherwise. High price for an ordinary product,"The bacon was good, the canadian bacon better. Smoked beef and sausages were pretty much mediocre. For the future I think I'll restrict my meat purchases to stores where I can see and try the product."
5,"yes, yes, yes","I'm in the business of teaching writing to business professionals and this book is a godsend. The instructional material up-front is right on, the useful appendixes at the end of the book are great (especially the grammar hotline directory which guides readers to grammar helplines throughout the country), but the greatest value are the model letters themselves. Plus the book comes with a software diskette that has the templates for all the model letters. This is great stuff"
5,great resource,"Great book, plus software templates for all routine business correspondence. Highly recommend."
3,Learning how to play like Al Di Meola,"I was quite excited when I purchased this book because I am an Al Di Meola fanatic when it comes to wanting to learn anything I can about his playing. Unfortunately the book is written for advance players who can read sheet music. There is only one page of music with tablature attached which means the rest of the exercises were a bit useless to me. There are some great pointers regarding picking techniques, posture, and scales but the exercises will be of little use to you if you cannot read standard notation. I would have bought the book regardless given that Al wrote the thing!!! It came almost a week earlier than planned and in pristine condition."
1,al di meola songs!,"this is not a picking tec book.i got it whit the houpe of geting pickng patern,s and excersicesand info about the risk and the pick....but insted you got fragment of his amezing songs.i know you can learn a lot from a song. but for me is not what im focus.any way is afordable and if you can get it! get it!!!"
4,18 in. Hoppity Ball,"Bought one for my 18 month old and my 4 yr old. Bought an 18in and a 26in. Review said it was suitable for an 18month and up. So I bought, it, but it is way to big and my 18 month has no idea what to do. The 26in. one took a little while for my 4 yr old to figure out, but she finally did and loves it. She bounces all over the place. I would definitely recommend for children atleast 3 yrs old. If your child has long legs it will be hard to do on either ball because it is so low to the ground. Overall an okay product, just not for an 18 month old."
3,unsure,was give to grandchild as a Christmas gift and with this being the dead of winter..unsure of how it will weather in these temps
3,Got it for Christmas 4 days later handle tore in half,The kids got this for Christmas on Tuesday here it is Friday and the handle already broke in half while one was hopping on it. We got all the correct size balls to go with the height if the child. Kept them inside since it has been cold. The main ball part seems very durable but the handle just looks a weak and to thin in the first place. Make the handle fatter and it will not be a problem.
4,Porsche Crazy,"I found the EC a super book and a very easy read. I pick it up and read a section of interest and then discover sometime of new interest. This is my second Streather book on Porsche, and he is by far my favorite porsche writer."
2,Bits and pieces of info - sorely disjointed,"I liked the cover, but upon getting the book I was sadly disappointed. The book is a collection of photographs and stats, but hardly any deep information. It is mostly one-sentence observations, but hardly much past that. Don't bother with this book. There is no reason that it is 688 pages - it is totally filler.Instead get:Porsche 911 Story - Paul Frere - Awesome history of the 911 detailing each model and engine configuration - and the decisions made for each revision.Illustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide - Dean Batchelor - Concise year-by-year, model-by-model review with good information.CaseyPorsche 911 Story: The Entire Development HistoryIllustrated Porsche Buyer's Guide (Illustrated Buyer's Guide)"
3,Good info...But,A well written document covering most of the elements a 993'er would be concerned with but a little underwhealming in terms of photos/graphics quality.
3,Grappling hook review,"I haven't used it yet, but it appears to be just what I was looking for. I will have to replace the nylon rope with chain though."
2,not sure,"didn't use this thing for covert ninja operations like I had planned, so I can't make any ninja recommendations."
3,THE START OF IT ALL!!!!! A Metal Legacy!!!,"This is the first CD by TNT. The ONLY CD that Tony Harnell is NOT ON! It is sung completely in Norwegian by Dag Ingebrigsten. Who personally can not touch Tony Harnell. But as a metal singer isn't that bad. Its not bad if you like listening to metal in a foriegn language. Musically its right there because you still have Ronni Le Tekro, Steinar Eikum & Morten Dahl. As a die hard TNT fan I have ALL the CD's including this one. This is a must have for any fan or collector. I gave it 3 stars only because it's not Tony singing."
3,"Ok for some stuff, just wanted a little more",I got the driver about two weeks ago. It's good for that fuzz sound. Stuff like the bass in Godzilla by Blue Oyster Cult. I do wish it had a little more variety sound wise. But it is fun to play with the fuzz sound that it provides.
5,Loads of Fun,"Timber is a wonderful game. It is loads of fun for everyone. You can have many players. They each take turns. You can use the blocks for lots of other fun stuff too. We have a player who is too young for the game, but he really enjoys stacking the blocks to make lots of different things. You can't go wrong with this game and the enjoyment last for hours and hours."
5,Thought provoking,A thought provoking book which seems to draw hateful commentsby many. I have visited Auschwitz andfind that all of the author's observations seem tobe correct. This book should be must reading in everyclassroom where holocaust studies is taught.
1,lie piled upon lie,"This book does not deserve a rating.It stands in a long line of worthless tracts of holocaust denial.For a thorough crtique of mottagno and his methods see Zimmerman at the Holocaust History Project on the inter-net.As Zimmerman points out (and is there for all to see)mottagno employs all of the holocaust denial contrivances ie obfuscation,distortion,mis-quotation,assumption and when all else fails deny,deny,deny.The real irony of the above is that Pressac as a former associate of the arch holocaust LIAR and anti-semite,faurrison,almost became a denier himself.Pressac then did some independent research the result being the definitive account of the Auschwitz death camp.As historical exposition mottagnos book is worthless.The holocaust was a reality the debate begins and ends there."
2,"Overly short, not up to other Bill Nye creations","I purchased this for my middle school library - just got around to viewing it. A bit of fluff without covering a lot of territory (about 3 min per episode). They could have done a bit more to instruct more (show multiple examples). It might work for a little review, but I think it would be confusing to students/kids who aren't familiar with the topics. For example, dimensional analysis/factor labeling can be quite confusing for students, and I don't think the episode clarifies much. Perhaps Bill is best to stick with Science."
2,Also Disappointing.,Same as the other Bill Nye Math Series.....not up to the same standards and educational value as the beloved Bill Nye the Science Guy. Waste of my money.
1,$1.99 from iTunes,"As a math teacher, I have found these videos entertaining for students and very helpful for keeping student engagement high. However, the price Amazon is expecting you to pay for this DVD is incredibly overpriced. Go to iTunes and download this item for $1.99."
3,Err...,Can't quite square the problematic simplicity of the statement as if solving some complex mystery.
1,didn't work,I have one indoor cat and this did nothing to reduce the flea problem! Finally with a comonation of Siphotrol Plus Fogger 6oz and 20 mule team borax sprinled on the rugs I got those little blood suckers!
1,Don't bother.,"I bought this and siphotrol since my dog cannot use spot-on treatments as she used to. She got fleas after moving to SC from PA. I got her hair cut very short. I took her out to the porch and sprayed my entire house with siphotrol. I went to the porch and applied (probably too much)of this product on the dog insuring she was thoroughly covered to the skin. I could see the fleas coming off of her. After she dried and the house dried, I took her inside and treated the yard, porch, and base of the house for insects. The orbitrol should kill and repel fleas for up to two months? The siphotrol up to seven months? This was all three days ago. The dog is covered with fleas and my wife has been bitten also. I did absolutely everything right, but it didn't work."
3,Seems working for a few days,"I only used it once on my dogs and it seemed working for a few days. However, I'm skeptical about its safety since the dogs like to lick themselves when they're wet. So I guess I'll only use it for spraying their beds and the house."
3,Not intended for use around the house,"This product is not for use around the house, as a couple reviewers have said. It is for use directly on the animal. I bought five bottles thinking I could spot spray around the house but, in fact, it is not meant for that.The label specifically says that it is for application on animals and that another product (Sephitrol) is to be used if there are already fleas in the house. The label also states that the spray should not be applied to, or damp animals allowed to come into contact with, ""painted or finished surfaces, including wood floors/furniture, leather/vinyl materials, or other surfaces of concern."" Furthermore, if you get it on your clothes you are supposed to wash your clothes immediately. Maybe you did not have problems but it is NOT for use around the house. Do what you want with chemicals but I prefer to follow the directions, especially since I have small children."
1,never again!,"First of all, the bottle leaked all over the inside of the carton. There wasn't much left when I got it.Secondly, I found it only effective for making my cats foam at the mouth and be highly irrated with me. It didn't stay on their coats/skin long enough to kill at thing, other than their appreciation of me.I tried a bit on the sofa -- in an inconsicuous area thankfully.I'm back to good ol' fashioned borax for carpet and upolstery flea treatments. Much more effective, and lots safer."
5,it works when nothing else will,my family have been using this sice the vet told us about it and we hade always used fruntline or other tope name brade itams and it just did not work and ovitrol works
3,flea spray,.it really kills the fleas on contact- but i would really like something to keep the fleas off for a week or two-flea collars are a total waste of m0ney.
5,love it,The flea either die immediately or jump off the other end of the dog! This is better than any other we've tried.
5,Works well,This product kills the fleas and eggs and works very well. I had to reapply about once a month to kill all the fleas though. Once I sprayed it on my cats the fleas were jumping off to get away.
3,Still Found Ticks on Horse,"I used this on my horse. I used to get Frontline Spray but they don't make that anymore so I've been trying to find an alternative. This lasts 2-3 applications on a horse. Frontline Spray lasted once so that's a plus. And this is cheaper than Frontline The first time I put this on repelled all ticks. The second time I still found several ticks. When I didn't use it I found 54 ticks when I went out for a ride! The second time when I did use the spray I found much less - somewhere in the upper teens, so it did make a dent, but I'd rather find NO ticks especially since I live in an area where lyme can be found."
2,Nope,Not only did this not show up on time at all but it doesn't work at all. Very not pleased but now I found some stuff that did work and all is well for me but the product not good at all.
4,This is OK,"It is cheap, sounds OK.This Chorus is clear and can keep bass part of sound but too digital sound...If you want vintage-analog chorus...forget it."
2,Very disappointing,I was so excited for this to come in the mail for my ferret. She hasnt got a new hammock since we bought her so i thought i would treat my little Bendi with a pretty hammock since hers was about to fall apart. Well when you purchase this product dont expect to get the pink striped one advertised. It was a ugly navy blue.. im very disapointed. The only reason i didnt rate it a one is because my ferret likes the feeling of the fur.
3,okay snuggy,"there were no defects with this product, but i was not blown away with the materials used. i also ordered other hanging items that were supposed to be in the identical fabric. the print was the same, but the colors were different. i think i'll stick to making my own."
2,Not very effective!,"It has a faint (pleasant) smell, but is not very effective absorbing bad odors. I will not but it again."
5,LOVER TO LOVER,"This is my FAVORITE Betty EP to date !High Hopes and Kiss My Sticky always lift my spirits.Alpaca is a HOOT !!!( I always wanted to use the word ""hoot"")"
5,Brings to life the world of Beatrix Potter,"Peter Rabbit, and his three sisters, Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail are seen off by their mother to go pick blueberries, for their mother's kitchen, but Peter Rabbit has other ideas.He decides to sneak into Mr. McGregor's garden, where he soon finds himself fleeing for his life.He does not want to end up like his father, who was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.This video brings to life the world of Beatrix Potter.The artist of the animations must certainly have studied the movements and way of rabbits to capture them so perfectly, and what was also captured beautifully was the English countryside in a better, simpler time.The music is also wonderful, particularly the last two songs.The Foxy Gentleman Song is marvelous, and the animations during the song, fit it perfectly."
1,Don't know what all the fuss is about this book,"What has been stated in this book has already been stated in many others. It appears to me that as much as John Shook - and the Womack - group may know, they still lack the practical applications of Lean. I have been in Lean for 20 years and cannot gain much new info from this book."
4,Security Warrior: A must.,"This has to be one of the best books I've read in quite some time. Security Warrior was easy to read and an attractive feature is the ability to skip between chapters without any problems. References to subjects covered in previous or in preceding chapters are noted. This book not only contains methods used by hackers but also details on how to protect yourself against attacks. It also includes programs (Bastille, IPtables, etc) with overviews of the important aspects. Anothere feature to note are the reference listings at the end of each chapter which include links to various useful sources.This book is a must get for those who wish to get an idea of what can be done to secure systems as well as showing you things that might be overviewed initially."
5,Good book for the Security Professional,I found this book to be helpful because it taught me the fundamental security concepts. It gives a good general understanding of the I.T. Security field
2,Weak Information,"This book should be titled ""General Security Buzzwords 101 For The High Level User."" The information in it just misses the information that one would be looking for in a technical environment."
4,Nice and Quiet but one issue....,"I bought this because we have a septic system and the install was very easy! it's nice and quiet, we didn't even think it was working at first it was so quiet! The ONLY issue I have with it is that the septic assist bottle will NOT hook into the disposer no matter what we try, so basically we paid extra for the septic assist and we can't use it.. I end up squirting the liquid straight into the disposer when I use it adding that one extra step when we use it. I may have just gotten one that was faulty but didn't want to unhook it all to return it and try again. it's still a GREAT product and I would buy it again!"
5,Fantastic Disposal,"I just installed the system, so I can only evaluate it based upon the installation experiance and its current operation. First, installation was easy, with nice illustrated installation instructions. My installation was a bit more complex since there was not an existing disposal in my home, so I had to do some wiring and rearrangement of the trap. The unit is a bit heavy, so I also had to make sure my sink was supporting the weight, so I added a few extra corner brackets under the sink. The disposal runs quiet and looks great."
3,Works well but Bio-Charge solution leaks,"Good quiet unit which seems to do a fine job grinding up everything we put down it. But it is now one year past the three year warranty and the bio charge solution has started leaking out around the cartridge. their tech suopport was not help and even stated that they ""have no torubleshooting information for the bio-charge system""So I am stuck paying for a service call"
5,Both songs are gem. An artist in her OWN class!,"She's Rap (Every Ghetto, Every City, Superstar), R&B; (I Used To Love Him, Nothing Even Matters), Soul (Forgive Them Father) and a bit of Pop (Doo Wop (That Thing) mixed in.I LOVED Ex-Factor but Everything Is Everything was my song back in '98. I even loved the quirky video, and Lauryn was cute in her blue and pink shirt, and that think on her head! LOL...Cover Art: A-Inside Art: N/ASongwriting: AVocals: CVocal Emotion: B-Vocal Acrobatics: C++Production: BLength: A-5 stars.Overall: A+"
2,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"The best track on this album is the instrumental track ""scarred"" (I think that's it)...the rest of it is just another EBM/Synth pop trio doing everything in thier power to sound exactly like VNV Nation. Pride and fall are one of the biggest rip off bands ever sighned to the Metropolis label. This album is well produced, catchy, copy cat music that will offend fans of VNV Nation more than please them."
3,Overrated,"Today I bought Pride and Fall's ""Elements of Silence"" and Covenant's ""Sequencer"". Having never heard either, but remembering how much I liked ""Dead Stars"" and remembering the stellar reviews for pride and fall, I had the best intentions going into this.It's not that great. It's good, but I wouldn't force anyone to listen to it. The lyrics are pretty silly sometimes, and while I can't do any better 'musically', I'm not making CDs. Listen hard before you decide to buy this. Either that or wait for it to show up in the bargain bin."
1,broke down after 3-month,I am a contractor. My Hitachi air compressor broke down after 3 month. Hitachi support team could not direct me to the right repair shop address the issue. It looks like to pay from my own pocket to fix it even though it is still under warrantty. Don't buy this.
4,good little compressor,"The compressor keeps up just fine for the last 5 years (one man show) as far as hard starting, I found if you use "" compressor pump oil "" there is NO problem, MOTOR OIL = never start right"
1,Don't Buy!,The pressure regulator never worked right and it was constantly tripping breakers. Compressor died completely after two years of very light home use.
2,Not very comfortable for a sandal,I am not impressed with these sandals at all. They are really thin and uncomfortable. If you are looking for a great sandal take a look at the ones made by either Sanuk or Sperry Top Sider. Either of those are super comfortable and not too expensive.
2,Mediocre.,This film bored me to death. The pacing is off and the protagonist is very poorly played. Not worth the effort.
1,Coaster Furniture,I just confirmed with Coaster that this set does NOT come with predrilled holes and the wood is very hard - so be prepared with an electric drill - or a very strong pair of hands
1,Delightful item EXCEPT,"I rated this as a single star to get your attention. Actually we very much liked the item and were amazed at the modest price however about a month after delivery I leaned far back and to my left to pick up an item from a small table and took a tough tumble to the floor. The left rear leg was severely bent. We then bought a couple of nice but plain wooden chairs from Amazon for $59 and are very pleased, but they sure don't have the bistro style. The rest of this story gets embarrasing, we kept the second bistro chair in use and at a later date I did it again and with the same result. If you will accept my exoperience as a warning and don't let guests sit in one of the chairs go ahead and buy it--it is a delightful set at little cost."
5,Good Item,"I really liked this product because it was just what I had been looking for, delivered right to my door and was so easy to put together. For me, these things are very important as I can't lift things myself which makes it hard to buy something like this at the store and put it in the car and carry into the house."
3,scratched table top,My only complaint is. The table and chairs are made of a very soft wood and the protective coating is very thin. I put a huge scratch in the table top while assembling it. Now I have to sand the table and chairs and re stain them so they all match.
1,WARNING - DIFFICULTY WITH ASSEMBLY,This set does NOT come with predrilled holes and the wood is very hard - I was not able to connect the wooden table top and chair seats to the metal frames because of this - both the manufacturer and the seller have not been helpful
2,It's inexpensive,Pool covers are pricy & I purchased this one because I was on a budget. It's not a premium grade cover that will last 8 years in my opinion but if you are on a budget like me it is a good option. It will probably last 2 maybe 3 years at best. The customer service is great too! I received a damaged cover & they responded quickly & very professionally to make things right.
3,pool cover,"My husband and I are first time pool owners and this winter pool cover was so easy to install. While it is just the beginning of the season, the cover seems to be very strong and fits our pool perfectly."
1,Ripped to shreds after only one season,I thought I was saving money by buying this cover instead of the expensive ones at my local pool supply store. It turned out to be a complete piece of garbage and ripped to shreds after one season. Going to give the Defender covers a try...
3,"Great customer service, product ???","First cover was on pool for 2 days and one of the seams came apart. Called and they said to just throw it away and they'd send me a new one. Received it the next day!! No charge, no sending the old one back. Impressed with customer service . . now we have to wait and see if the new cover lasts thru the winter or not."
4,Good for what it is,"This is a great *introductory* book for someone who knows how to sing but is intimidated by sight singing. It is very basic--just a start--and you will need to supplement it with subsequent books or lessons. But it doesn't cost much and will get the student going. Here's a true story:My wife has an excellent voice, but did not know how to sight sing and was convinced that she could never learn. I bought her this book and she went through it in one weekend. That Tuesday she auditioned for a chorus and was asked to sight sing a simple piece. She did, she passed, and now she sings in the chorus. I have her going through another book and she is progressing well."
3,Sight Singing Made Simple,"It is explained very simply and in an organized fashion which builds upon each level systematically. The audio is midi basedand has quite a simple digitized sound, yet it is clear for the purpose."
3,AN ENIGMA,"WELL MY SINGING TEACHER GAVE ME THIS BOOK WHEN I GOT ANGRY AT MY OLD ONE, YOU KNOW?? 100 MOST BEAUTIFUL SONGS, IT WAS A GREAT BOOK (EXCEPT FOR THE EXCLUSION OF LIKE GLUE) BUT I WAS JUST SORT OF FRUSTRATED BY IT, CAUSE SURE, THEY HAD THE LYRICS, BUT HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SING!? A WORD ON A PAGE??!?THIS BOOK SIDE STEPS THE ISSUE ENTIRELY..LEADING US TO A PLACE OF HARMONY, THROUGH UNDERSTANDING.. SERIOUSLY THOUGH, THE MYSTERIOUSLY TITLED 'SIGHT SINGING' IS A CONUNDRUM AND A JOY BUT ALSO A MYSTERY. FOR AS MUCH AS I LEARN TWO MORE QUESTIONS CROP UP TO TAKE THEIR PLACE..SO IM CONSTANTLY SEARCHING FOR THE ANSWERS THAT ARE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. MAYBE IM OVERTHINKING IT.MAYBE THERE ARE NO TRUE ''ANSWERS''.MY TEACHER SAYS THAT IM IMPROVING.IM A MUSICAL MAN."
5,"GREAT PLAYER,GREAT VALUE","A""no frills"" great sounding player.The previous reviewer(Big Bad Dad) must have a defected unit,as I have not experience any of those problems. In fact I bought two more."
5,Very well reaserched historically and a great story as well.,I enjoy reading Roman period fiction and this is well researched and a very good story behind a character that very little is known about. Being wife of Pontius Pilate she was involved in possibly the most politically significant event in the history of the world. I really felt as though I was there. It is a quite remarkable piece of work from a new author. I hope she writes more.
4,Olives,These olives arrived on time but the end container leaked into package. Containers are plastic and apparently brittle. Not sure if it was dropped or what? Still they taste good. I bought the cherry pitter as recommended in an earlier post and really like it too. It does a great job on the olive pits.
2,Want some Cheese with your Whine?,"If you are a die hard R&P fan, nothing written here will disuade you from purchasing this CD, if you are new to the ways of these two men then I would recommend another selection.Unlike their other albums which mix an almost equal ammount of humor with social commentary this album falls far short in the humor category. While ""Once Upon A Time"" and ""Oh No! I'm in Love"" are mildly amusing the majority of this album seems to be either a song of righteous indignation, or a song about breaking up and the destruction of relationships.You can definately tell that the songs on this album were written while Ron and Phil were breaking up as a couple, but do we really need to pay good money to listen to their therapy sessions?Definately not their best album."
3,It`s 4 Elvis movies in one package.,"I love Live a Little, Love a little..., and they were missing in my collection. It`s always fun to have Elvis around!"
4,good shows,just some more good shows that i and my wife like and watch and the kids even like his shows
4,I'm an Elvis fan,"These are not good movies, only about four of his movies are. But if you are a real Elvis fan it really doesn't matter. All you really watch them for is to see Elvis perform live. And this collection has exemplory performances."
3,You know what to expect.,"Pretty standard Elvis fare. Kissin Cousins is a bit of fun, especially with Elvis in the double role. Girl Happy is standard 60's and seems to meld into a number of his others (maybe because Shelley Fabares and Mary Ann Mobley were in more than one Elvis movie, sometimes in the same year!). I liked Tickle Me, it had more real humour than most Elvis films, except Follow that Dream. And I could live without Live a Little except for the song Edge of Reality. Overall, movies I remember from the 60's Drive In with Mum, Dad and Sis packed in the car on a friday night. Some good memories, some good songs, some embarrasing acting and pretty harmless fun. That said, I liked Elvis early movies much more, the songs were better and he wasn't sleep walking thru' the, admittedly unchallenging, roles."
5,elvis presley musicals,i love elvis presley movies. this 4 in 1 movies is great value. i have bought many elvis movies.you will enjoy these movies
5,Great Umbrellas!!,We purchased six of these umbrellas to use at the clubhouse swimming pool within a lake front development we manage! The club members have been very pleased with these umbrellas! We are very happy with our purchase!
5,Jimmy time,"It sees only natural for reggae's elder rootsman to make an album in this style. On the song ""Rise up"" He teamed with digital rythm masters Wycliffe ""steely"" Johnson and Clevland ""clevie"" Browne, drawing on his ska and early regea roots and spiritual vision while rhythmically placing him firmly in the dancehall. Cliff's sweetly weathered voice and engaging vocal arrangements float over a tough but bouyant rythm, creating one of the most distinctive recorse of the conciouse reggea period."
4,"Not a classic, but a good effort","Jimmy delivers the goods as usual. Although it's not as thoroughly excellent as some of his albums, there are some great cuts. The cover of James Taylor is a nice touch."
2,weak 2nd season,"well i can't disagree more with the previous reviewers. of the two seasons, this is by far the weakest. the first season i thought was real cutting edge drama/comedy. the second season is almost politically correct and could almost be shown on commercial tv. plus, ms. piper is might either be pregnant during the shooting or just had a baby. her face is very puffed out, wears very baggy clothes (kinda goes against what the show is about, doesn't it?), has clever camera angles and editing. of course has a body double for the nude scenes. which by the way, there isn't as much as the first season. there also isn't much for comedy. i think there was one or two early episodes that made me chuckle, but that was about it. i would try to view this season before buying it. it definately does not hold up."
3,un professional and screwed up,"Belle is delightful. The show is funny. However the situations she gets into are totally unprofessional and would cause her career to crash quickly. Her screening of clients seems haphazard. Clients wives finding her is ridiculous. Connecting with the wrong client in a bar is hilarious in the age of cell phones!!Bambi, her newbie partner, is a total loser and violates her boundaries, yet Belle sticks by her.Belle has too many unresolved issues about her double life to long surviveas a call girl.`The Sopranos' about a gangster and his double life does a very good job.Clearly real professionals handle a double life very well.I like `Sex in the City' much Better for a realistic thinking show about Sex."
5,Billie...,"I love this actress from her Doctor Who BBC days, also I don't get SHO. so had to buy her new series, this did not disappoint, can't wait for the next season."
3,"the show is only okay, and where is season 3?","I love Billie Piper from Doctor Who so I bought the first 2 seasons of this show to watch - and it's definitely not a show I'm on the edge of my seat about. It's interesting and entertaining, given the subject matter, but if you're looking for a series that will draw you in and make you love the characters, I don't think this is the one for you. Having said that, I breezed through the first 2 seasons and can't stream the third from Amazon at all.... However, Amazon does offer the 4th and final season? WHY?!? I'm upset that amazon does not have the third season available in any format! What's that about?"
4,Secret Diary of a Call Girl Season 2,"The first thing I noticed when I opened this up is how dull the packaging is compared to the season 1 release. It doesn't have a slipcase, and looks really rushed. The episodes are good quality, and everything is standard, but it's not as well done as the first season, but it still meets the standard for a small TV release. I'd recommend buying if you're a fan of the show."
1,Wait for the next one,"This book is merely a text copy of the information that ships with the training DVD you get when you buy Aperture. In other words, you already have all this information if you own the program. The only value to this book is as a companion to the DVD or if you don't own the program and want to see what it can do. I'd wait for the next title in the series if you want some real training."
1,Do NOT buy this book!,"This slim volume is mostly white space and very large type. None of the information in this little booklet is particularly helpful nor illuminating and it should have all been included with the application anyway.Buying this dumb little ""book"" will only reinforce your frustration with Aperture and your distaste for Apple.Don't do it.david boise ID"
1,Defective CD,"This book is not easy to follow, which was likely due to the defective CD included with it. The CD contained the practice lessons, and didn't even load an icon. I've attempted to follow along with pre-loaded pictures but have found it very frustrating."
5,Amazingly Easy to Use Guide and Aperture Overview! Love This Book,"This book is by far, the best Aperture book out there. people are quick to criticize it because it covers a lot of what the shipped booklet covers. This book is way better because it goes into so much detail. For anyone who would bash Apple and Aperture, they must have been living in a cave for the past 10 years. Aperture and this book are by far, the best reason to own and Apple if you are a photographer. Buy it Now and try it out! If you take your time and go thru chapter by chapter, you will be a pro at Aperture. This book is truly a gem and anyone who says otherwise probably didn't read it or is just hating on Apple because their software and machines are truly superior to anything else out there today."
2,Expensive,Based on the price I thought this woould be a bag of at least 5 and possibly 10 of these. The price is for a single insert. Quality item at and delivered on time. Just very pricey since these usually go for 20 or 30 cents a each.
4,The war moves to a new battleground.,"Claire Redfield breaks into the Paris HQ of Umbrella to find her brother Chris, but is captured instead. From Paris she is taken to a top secret Umbrella facility on Rockfort Island in the Southern Atlantic (evidently a stone's throw from both South America and Antartica). Before anybody can get their torturous hands on Claire there is an attack and a T-Virus outbreak. Now different monsters run the facility, can Claire escape? S.D. Perry's sixth contribution to the popular survival horror adaptations and spin-offs maintains the solid standards she has set with the earlier books, though the climax here feels a tad rushed. Fans will enjoy it. Recommended."
3,"""Code"" Is Cryptic","Exotic locales are the springboard in this latest entry of S. D. Perry's 'RE' offering. From a South Atlantic island off the coast of South America to bases at the South Pole on the Antartic continent, exotic realms abound. Add to this a secluded mansion inhabited by reclusive twins and haunted by Bandersnatches, this strange brew conjures an unusual concoction of imagary spanning everthing from 'The Thing' to 'Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass'. traditional elements of gothic novels are prevelant as well. Yet, through all of this, 'Code: Veronica' often remains cryptic as the many parts to this puzzle lose cohesion and the conclusion having the impression of being forced or rushed. At times, the residents of this 'Resident Evil' almost seem unclear how to stay in character. Though there is a bit of a fumble here, S. D. Perry does a respectable job at providing a readable sixth tale for the 'RE' franchise volumes of books."
2,It doesnt do the game justice.,"I loved the Resident Evil games. I bought a DreamCast just to play Code Veronica. And when I found out that a series of books was going to be deticated to these games, I jumped on it, buying them as soon as they hit shelves. All of them are instant classics, yet, Code Veronica doesnt seem to do a good job portraying the game as the first and third books have done. Important scenes are rushed trough, heck, Chris's arival on the island to look for Claire only last's about 8 pages, then he's on antartica. That part was the hardest, and exciting point in the game. Having to revisit the shattered complex, fending off againt hunters and zombies. And this book is ssoo short. I read it in two nights, and felt disapointed."
3,Not very scary.,"It seems that every other book in the Resident Evil book series is not very good. And this is one of them. I could understand the other ones not being to great because they are not based on the games, but this one is. I was a little shocked that I wasnt shaking in my bed. Read it just to keep you posted as to what is going on in the series, but not to be scared."
2,Not quite as good as the cheaper ACE version,"I got this one and found it uncomfortable. The one mistake many manufacturers make is that the front strapping is too narrow. When this is the case, it tends to gather and cut, especially on portly fellows like myself. The ACE version of this support has a wider front strap and more adjustment. I am able to wear it for longer periods of time, and even forget at times that I'm wearing a support. Not so for the McDavid.If you're a bigger guy, do a search on Amazon for ""ACE Back Brace, 1-Count Package"" and select the first item that comes up."
4,this album + candle + cinnamon = holiday nostalgia,"My mother wisely purchased this as a tape for me, with two other baroque selections, from Music For Little People when I was a little girl, and we played it every Christmas season while decorating the house and churning out tray after tray of traditional Scandinavian baked goods. It is an accessible introduction to this era's music, instrumental, but with familiar strains of holiday carols and noels. If you purchase it, you must promise to play it in the home with family, food, and the flickering light of a candle or woodstove!"
5,Fire,Excellent book. Well written and very informative.Fire In The Turtle House: The Green Sea Turtle and the Fate of the Ocean
2,Fire in the Turtle House,I did not like it. I found that it could not hold my attention or interest where other authors did.
3,Turtle Review,"I thought that this book was ok. At times it was kind of boring and random. But, i liked learning about the turtles and the mysterious disease afflicting them. Overall this book is educational and good to read if you have some free time, but nothing special."
3,pentax digitalcamara adaptor PF-DS1,We have ordered all the products for our spotting scope from Pentax to be sure that all our product combine perfectly.The digital camera optio S7(we were told that all optio S type would fit on the adaptor)did not fit perfectly therefore the 'cable release 30' could not be used.We had to buy a remote control for the camera.With this combination we can make digital pictures with our spotting scope.
3,"Good, but with one drawback...","I liked this DVD but with one exception -- the music! I realize that they were trying to make it more appealing to the general public by adding upbeat music but, to me, thats not yoga. Yoga should be relaxing and calming -- it shouldn't have a techno/house beat in the background. Its a shame because I probably would have purchased the DVD if it weren't for the music -- I really liked the instructor. If only there were an option to do the routine without the music."
4,Decent at home yoga DVD,I like that they show lots of modifications. An overall good at home yoga workout.
4,"nice, well balanced home workout","a very good offering from MTV that has become my ""go to"" tape for at-home practise. it should appeal to yogi's of all levels -- it's not too easy, which is a pitfall many ""beginner"" yoga programs fall into as viewers advance quickly beyond basic pose explanations. if someone needs more basic pose instruction, this is handled nicely by an added segment outside of the program itself which reviews important poses like downward dog.the length of the program is approximately 40 minutes, which i think is perfect for at-home practise, because i find that longer programs are more difficult to get through when you're on your own without an instructor. i always feel like i get the stretch i need and i feel better after doing this program. my one nitpicky criticism is the oversight they make in doing ""screaming pigeon"" on the left-side, but forgetting to do it on the right-side. it surprises me they don't at least make an attempt to edit this in later."
4,Yoga made hip,"I have actually taken this yoga instructors classes in NYC and found them to be some of the best at Crunch at that time..Also, as beautiful as MsMcGee is,she is very modest and sincere..The thing about this tape is that as one OTHER reviewer stated it is for the HIP crowd..There is HOUSE music, and a dj,and slick camera shots..as well as a bunch of ""hotties"" doing the postures..I am a bit old for this ""slickness"",however the work out is decent,and I did feel invigorated afterwards..I would reccommend this tape to those 18-27 years old,OR as an addition to other tapes to break the monotony..Not bad just HIP.."
4,GREAT WORKOUT - EVEN FOR BEGINNERS,"If you have never done YOGA before, this seems a bit challenging at first. But after a few times it becomes easier (I think so at least). The instructor is absolutely excellent at coaching the viewer through each movement using the breath. Her voice is pleasant to listen to also. I guess since this was MTV's first attempt at a YOGA video, they used the poor marketing ploy of using Lori from the Real World. This is a great workout that can carry it's own weight without the help from mock celebrities. The second DVD is even better than this one, and I use both of them intermintently."
3,"Take a class instead, but if you can't this is OK",It's a decent yoga workout. Far too short. The fast pace between movements is different than I'm used to but all right (I could imagine it'd be hard on someone who does not know the poses). The instructor is great. The idea of having back-up people for different levels is good...if those said people actually do demonstrate the modifications and with good form (Lori!!). It would be more worthwhile to have experienced people doing modified poses so that you're not learning bad form (since they don't focus on Ms. Mcgee enough). But overall an OK workout.
1,Mockery of yoga. Too loud music.,I am an inter/adv excerciser and I don't like this video at all. The music is too loud. Yoga is supposed to be calming and relaxing. The instructor's voice is drowned in the &quot;music&quot;. I am ready to give away this video.
5,Lori Trespicio is VERY WONDERFUL,"I had never gone to yoga before and I never will (it's a waste of my time) so I bought this tape basically just because I've seen preview's of it on MTV and Lori from the Real World is so hot! I'm so glad I bought it it's not impossible, the instructer Kristin McGee seems so nice, and she explains everything really well, the music is good (DJ remixes), and its the perfect amount of time (about 40 minutes). The first day after I did it, I was sore...but the good kind of sore. I knew that yoga had actually worked so people go get this."
1,Don't waste your money,"I found this DVD yoga workout to be distracting. The music is so loud you can't get relaxed. The music can be turned off, but it still doesn't help."
5,"Exactly, exactly what I was seeking!","I did yoga classes for 1-2 years at my local gym in San Francisco (Club One) and loved them. I live too far to continue going, and haven't done yoga now for over a year, but have been searching for a way to get back into it. This DVD is almost exactly the same routine that I used to do in the gym with the instructor!!! I have done yoga for a few years now, but it was only with one or two different instructors the whole time, and to my pleasant surprise, this DVD follows the same routine. Vinyasa, I think is what they call it? So... nice and quick pace, you change poses with each 'inhale or exhale, and the room they are in is gorgeous! So rich and deeply colored. I love this DVD."
3,Power Yoga,"I bought this DVD several years ago and I like the variety of the poses and difficulty level of the video. My biggest problem with the video is that either its because of the speed of transition between poses or because one second you head is facing up and then its down, I find that I get VERY LIGHT HEADED. Also at the end of the work out I don't really find that peaceful relaxed feeling that I get from other vidoes like Ali McGraw Total Mind and Body. I find that I often follow my own variations of the poses that I've picked up from other videos because they sometimes feel more natural to me and sometimes I just can't do the pose in the length of time that is allowed to keep up with the instructor. I still play this workout occasionally when I want some variety to my exercise and over all I think it's a good video."
2,Boot Camp Yoga,This dvd is not yoga. It is Power Yoga...that is not Yoga..or at least what yoga was intended to be. And again...it contained that old downward dog/sun salutation at lightning speed routine that is showing up on all the Yoga workout dvd's now. I felt that this would be ok for a person that is into aerobics and not so much the experience of yoga. There were some beneficial things on this dvd but this is not for beginners.
2,extraneous talking,"I thought it focused more on the fact that they had Lori (from the Real World?) than on acutal yoga. There is 30 minutes of stuff to fast forward through before you get to any workout. When I buy workout tapes or DVDs I actually want to workout not watch an MTV show. In fact, I bought the tape because I thought it might be set to contemporary, fast-paced music, like Inhale used to be on Oxygen network. I was very disappointed."
3,Great for beginner to intermediate level.,"If you are a serious power yoga practitioner, you may find this workout to be on the easy side. As you can read from the other reviews here, Kristin McGee flies through some of the poses, and while this may get your heart pumping aerobically, it doesn't really build strength as quickly as you would do in traditional power yoga where poses are held for 4-5 breaths. Now I realize that this is titled MTV ""yoga"" and not MTV ""power yoga"", but I wanted to clarify for others who might consider purchasing this based on reviews saying that this is a difficult workout. I would call it an intermediate workout, even if you did the more advanced versions of the postures. If you're into Baron Baptiste style yoga, you may find this too easy."
4,One of the best out there,"I have been doing this yoga routine for 10 years! I actually purchased it twice, because I lost my original copy at one point. When I first got it back in 2002, I was out of shape from having my first son. I couldn't even get halfway through the routine before I turned it off. Discouraged, I didn't go back to it for almost year. Once I started back, I kept at it and eventually was able to do the more advanced variations of the routine with ease. I used this DVD (in addition to brisk walking) to lose pregnancy weight each time I had a child. Compared to other yoga workouts that I've tried in the past 10 years I really like this one the best. Kristen McGee is a wonderful instructor. She's not boring, like many but she also isn't so excited about the routine that it seems fake. The music in the DVD is nice as well. It's not too loud or obnoxious. I would definitely recommend this to someone, despite the fact that it's now 10 years old."
5,Very good and challenging yoga workout,"I have started practicing Iyengar yoga and wanted a few videos to practice at home. After viewing this video, I was very impressed with Kristin McGee's cueing ability, her attention to the breath, and overall flow through the poses. I also really appreciate that there are 3 levels so that once I master the beginning foundational poses I can look at the other two people on the video for more challenging postures.This is a very good yoga workout, it is challenging, yet it has a lot of the same feel as a yoga class does. It combines the spiritual with the practical. Definitely worth the money!"
5,awesome,"this is a great yoga dvd for the beginner to the more flexible advanced yogi. It gives a full, satisfying, and peaceful workout to some great music. I highly recommend it."
2,boot camp,"The music and production of this video was good, but that's about all. I felt like I was in boot camp doing this video. It was like ""drop and give me a pose"" now jump up and give me another. I wasn't even in my pose before they had moved on to the next. It was more an aerobic video than a yoga video."
3,Even my 3 year-old said MOMMY THIS IS TOO FAST!,"I liked the dvd but it is just a HAIR TOO FAST! I'm in fantastic shape but yoga should not be a race! It causes tension trying to keep up. It is a really good workout though. I do it less than i do my Shiva Rea Shakti yoga or Gaiam Earth, Water, Fire yoga, though. It's not my favorite but if you have dozens of dvd's it IS worth adding to your collection. It's OKAY. Just get it on sale! It does the job I just don't like how fast the sun salutations go! The rest of the dvd is fine."
5,EXCELLENT ! The book has paid for itself many times over .,"I am a field medic with the Michigan Army National Guard. I was so impressed with this book that I took it in to the armory, passed it around, and got seven of my fellow medics interested enough to buy the book. I keep a copy of the book in my medical bag for both reference and training purposes. When I am out in the field with the grunts (ifantry troops )I try to give a class or two on first aid. Some day I might be the patient. The book is easily worth three times its retail price."
2,Nike Watch Arms Fall Off,"I bought this watch for my boyfriend as a gift. In the 6 months since he has received it, both arms have been pulled off from the watch face. I do not suggest this watch not necessarily because of the poor quality, but the cost. It can be expected that watches, especially plastic and rubber ones would break in this way, but one should not expect this from nike, or for the price paid. I'd suggest ironman for a good sturdy watch, or if nike is your thing, get a watch that does not have the separate piece arms."
4,Good collection,"*WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK*Not gonna lie, I actually do not like the second or fourth Nightmare on Elm Street movies, they just felt unnecessary and kinda stupid to me. And the third one I only thought was decent. I would have liked it a lot more if Nancy had survived, because I hate it when they go and kill the main character of the first film in sequels, it just irks me. The very first Nightmare on Elm Street is great, one of my favorite horror movies. It had an interesting concept and was pulled of very nicely, it doesn't seem too long or too short, the acting is good, and the suspense I thought was good too. This is a nice collection though if you really like the Nightmare on Elm Street series. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,it's ok,These were great movies back in the days but when you watch them when your older they are not the same
3,I LOVE the films but i hate the quality of this pack,"I got this for about 10.00 and I can say that the first disc doesn't evean work because they are double sided disc's. Evean one little scrach will make it unplayable, at least for me. I just decided to pay extra money and get the box set, but hey if you are low on cash I guess its not that bad of a deal. Just be very carfull with the disc's."
3,Freddy Collection is okay,"I remember watching the Nighmare On Elm Street movies when I was a kid and loving them, however, I am an adult now and watched the 4 Nightmare movies and realized how bad my judgement of horror movies was when I was a kid. The first Nightmare on Elm Street was pretty good, but the others were TERRIBLE! I could barely stay awake watching the other 3 Nightmare movies. I am a HUGE horror movie fan (70's and 80's genre horror) but this collection should have not been added to my collection. The first Nightmare movie is a must to own, but the other three will defintely be collecting some dust in my house. I am so glad I paid less than $12 for all 4 movies because one cent more and I would be a bit upset."
4,GREAT FOR BEGINNERS,IF YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED BLACKJACK THEN THIS IS A GOOD SOURCE OF INFORMATION. LEARN WHEN TO HOLD AND LEARN WHEN TO HIT. KEEP PLAYERS ON YOUR SIDE HAPPY AGAINST THE DEALER. GO PLAY. GOOD LUCK
3,Minimum counting maximum winnings,Play basic strategy and count tens and aces. Thats about it but there is a lot more info on betting strategy. OK book at a good price. For the serious only. If your playing to have fun the basic strategy will do you fine with a lot less stress.
2,Confused,"It's not like I have never read a book on Blackjack. In fact, while not any kind of pro, I've been student of Blackjack for 35 years. I found this book to be disorganized and conflicting. The book said it was very simple, but in fact was not. Much of the material was unnecessary. The author made some mathematical asumptions that according to a mathematicain friend, is incorrect. In one part of the book, the author expresses one idea then contradicts it later. Difinately NOT recommended."
5,The Only BJ Book you will even need,"I have purchased and read five BJ books. When I first bought this book I was still learning basic strategy and only after 3 yrs of basic strategy and understanding the game better was I able to truely appreciate this book. This book should be on every BJ players bookself. If you are just starting out then start here. Learn everything Renzy teach on basic strategy, then move on to KISS I. Once you have succeed these 2 steps, then and only then continue your education. Buy this before any other BJ book. This book has more meat in it than any other. Only half the book is worth many times its value. Its for the casual player and for the professional. Casual players and professionals do NOT need to buy anything else. If you suceed at learning KISS I, and I mean really learn it and apply it in casinos, then you can decide if you want to advance to KISS II/III or try KnockOut BJ or a different system. Start here and you won't regret it!"
4,Informative book!,"I love the game, and i enjoyed this book. I would also recommend, Gregorian Strategy for multiple deck blackjack."
2,not very enjoyable reading,didnt finish this book so I want write a review about it. but really is their like a lot to learn about black jack that you need to read a book.
1,Misleading information; be careful,"Be careful- the author's implication is that you can win money playing Blackjack. This is not true. None of the techniques described will cause you to win money. In any casino game (including Blackjack), you are mathematically guaranteed to lose money. Even if you temporarily have a short-term win for a day, that will be dwarfed by the Law of Large Numbers, which guarantees you will lose that money (and then some) over time."
4,Good stuff here,"I recently discovered online Blackjack and wanted to review/learn some new tips for winning strategies. Thankfully, this book not only provides great basics for getting that winning edge, but without even mentioning online Blackjack, this book clearly laid out why it isn't a good investment to play online Blackjack. Stick to the casinos, read this book, and grab that winning edge."
4,"Interesting, readable","Interesting, readable book on the basics of advantage play. Few surprises but quality information. Renzey is a real no-nonsense author, though he could take some pointers from Scoblete's light-hearted writing styles."
3,Not Bad For The Price,"I got to play on one of these (used) at a local guitar shop, and although it didn't have gypsy strings, it didn't sound half bad! Rosewood necks are far inferior to ebony, so that's where it loses points. Also, it doesn't really project like a gypsy axe should (possibly because of the strings), but, hey, it's only $200! A great entry-level gypsy guitar."
2,A bad book,"This is probably the most disappointing university text book that I have ever bought. Its informal style may appeal to some, but too often, it simplifies the topic so much, that you don't really learn anything. On our first day, our professor said that he ""hated this book but was obliged to use it."" I tried to give it a chance. The formulas are not presented until the end of the chapter, and there are very few examples given, leaving the reader to try the exercises blindly. I'm sure there are better statistics texts out there."
3,not what i wanted,These blades are ok. The blades I really wanted are the Hitachi progressive (progressor?). They are green in color and have a very aggressive tooth. They are by far the best sawzall blades I have ever use. Does anyone know if they are still available? These blades are not nearly as good.
4,Caz's birthday blues,"It starts out when new girl Caz moves to greenside. She the meets her next door neighbour lauren and her friends Sunny, Jess ,Michelle And Nikki. They invite her to go bowling, but she is shy and says no. The next day at school , Caz meets a mean girl, Melissa and she makes friends with her. Melissa makes it clear that she has to be friens with her and not lauren. The next day Lauren, Michelle and Jess and Caz and Melissa all go shopping. Melissa tries to frame lauren for swhoplifting, but Caz stoppes her and Melissa breakes friends with her. Then Caz is friends with Lauren and friends. Caz does not know what to do for her birthday and Lauren and crew throw her a moon and stars party.It was a great book,and really good pictures.You can also throw your own moon and stars party by reading the bonus instructions."
2,NOT a how to guide.,"For being geared towards men, this is definitely not the 'how to' guide I would have expected.First off, like many other guys, I wanted basically a shop manual.. directions, maybe illustrations, specifics, etc. straight to the point.I'd say about 75% of this book is a compilation of stories (that read out like the letters in Penthouse magazine, ironically which he used to work for). Many of the stories sound unnecesarily vulgar, and somewhat absurd. I didn't want to hear about some guy getting himself aroused alone and.. I'll leave the rest to you. He also had sections teaching you 'the way a lady should be treated' and to be honest, this section sounds like it was written by my mother to teach me how to get girls. (which is the LAST advice on the planet any of us would ever take)If you're looking for a manual, or a typical 'how to' guide that we're all accustomed to, look elsewhere."
3,funny book,"i have this bok as well as it's sister book how to drive your man wild in bed. and i must say this book is great although portions of it push on the absurd which makes it funny. masterton takes his work so seriously and roughly 45-50% of it is as stated before, absurd. i recommend this book as well as it's sister to those looking for a laugh."
3,Avid Reader,"Great read with techniques that you could use right away. The book has no pictures, so that might bother some people. I didn't have trouble zooming through it. The wisdom in this book was still worth more than what I paid for it."
3,Never Buy a Book Out of Boredom,"I ordered this out of boredom. Glanced at it, read some parts, but didn't find it interesting or informative. Great title, though."
1,for the INSECURE & DEJECTED only,"this book is for people with low self esteem. its for guys with small penises. its for middle age men who no longer have the capacity to ""get it up"".its for sad pathetic guys who think sex is the only thing worth living for. sad but true."
4,"Looking forward to the new edition coming out in June, 2000","I have found this book to be very helpful but I am l waiting on the new edition to come out in June, 2000 before purchasing. The eighth edition is great, however, many chances have occured in Key West since the hurricane in 1998. Many of the older guesthouses have been remodeled.I travel to the Keys quite often and this is the only guide I use. The 1997 edition was the third edition that I have bought. GREAT BOOK!"
4,Great mitts!,These oven mitts are great and I really like the fact that there is a super strong magnet making them easy to have handy on the side of the fridge. They are also long enough so that I don't burn myself once again on my convection oven that has the heating element just inside the front door. Only reason I gave these a 4 instead of a 5 star rating is because of the fact that they are quite large and bulky. that being said they work great and I never feel the heat coming through them.
3,Silicone Oven Mitt,"sits in the kitchen drawer mor than we thought it would...kinda 'bulky' but great for large projects like Turkey, largecasseroles, or lasagna dishes...would prob not buy another tho-"
3,Awkward to use,"Have had only limited use so far. The protect from the heat well, but not very flexible and are awkward to use. We have gotten ""Ov Gloves"" which are much easier to use, but not water or steam proof. The Ov Gloves will probably get more use."
2,Decent book ruined by terrible writing,"Author tries to maximize number of letters used to describe each concept. Result is a waste of time, since the concepts the author describes aren't even that complex or novel."
5,Searching for Chinese roots in Taishan,"A remarkable book consisting of 13 narratives recruited via the Internet from Chinese living all over the globe who decided to go to villages in Taishan from where their parents has emigrated. The tales are very well written, and reveal the tremendous need that these descendants of immigrants have to visit the birthplaces of their parents. The sample is quite diverse with respect to gender and age, but most, if not all, are highly educated professionals who were willing to reflect on the impact of their visits and to describe their lives growing up as mostly poor minority group members in the countries where their parents moved to. Despite this one 'shortcoming', this collection should be read by anyone wanting to know more about the lives of Chinese immigrants and their children."
2,12 volt scissors jack,Better be careful not to allow anything like sticks or rocks to get in scissors area of jack because the internal gears are made of plastic. After several uses the pressure switch became inoperative and gears stripped inside.
1,poor jack,Used once and inside gear shattered and jack was unusable. Cannot get parts to repair jack. Tried online and calling. No reply from anyone. Would not recomend. A waist of money
5,Still the best reading methods book around,"This book by Vacca is still the best of the content-area reading books on the market. Unlike many of the others out there, this one shows splendid visual representations and step-by-step approaches to a variety of reading strategies for secondary teachers. Save yourself time. Give this one a try."
3,Could have been better,"I have not read the book extensively, but only to find specific information pertaining to pre, during and post reading strategies. The book seems generally well written and provides some good examples in which teachers can use to help their students to become better readers, however I found the book to be lacking in quantity as it relates to containing a wide variety of strategies that can be used with students."
3,Same as 1220SA without the 2 SATA cables,This is the same asAdaptec 2232100-R 1220SA PCI Express X1 2-Port SATA 3GBS Low-profile Host RAID Controllerwithout the 2 SATA cables and a retail box. It is about $13 cheaper. My comments about the outdated software and firmware as I wrote on myAdaptec 2232100-R 1220SA PCI Express X1 2-Port SATA 3GBS Low-profile Host RAID Controllerreview equally apply here.
4,saves time and money,This repair takes more time than a normal toilet repair due to the mounting of the valve and removal of the toilet. It took a few flushes to seat the seals. This is because the valve has an up and down handle and it controls the flapper as well as the water seal ball valve. If instructions are followed and you hold up on the handle a few times you will stop the unnecessary water waste.
5,The Definitive P&C Collection,"With their 'Greatest Hits' package, Paola and Chiara Iezzi have managed to put together a stunning representation of their growth over the last ten years. From 90's pop such as 'Ci Chiamano Bambine' to brand new songs such as the stunning 'A Modo Mio' and 'Fatalita', this CD covers all their great albums, with exclusive and hard-to-find remixes of favorite songs such as 'Viva el Amor!', and 'Fino Alla Fine'.What makes this package truly great though is the inclusion of the DVD. 19 of their best music videos, including two uncensored versions of the controversial 'Kamasutra' promo. Stunning picture quality, and perfect sound combine to create over an hour of pure Paola and Chiara magic.This collection is an absolute must for any P&C; fan. The DVD is worth the price alone. You won't be disappointed!"
4,The Real Deal,"I was ecstatic when I realized that I could buy from Amazon the famous work that I saw quoted so many places, The Annals of the Four Masters.Not inexpensive, but it is exactly what it purports to be, the annal compilation for the years outlined in the description. Note that this is not all of the annals compiled by the Masters, nor is it the only edition that was ever published (in the 19th century). But this is the most popular edition and the only one that I could find in print today. Great map and name index and just generally well-made.If you feel the 'need' to touch a historical source and hold it in your hands - then you should buy this edition."
2,Where are the Annals from 550-1171?,"Does anyone know why this ""Part 1"" translation doesn't cover 550-1171? That time period is covered in the original... According to the wikipedia entry the Annals cover 550-1616."
5,"First Ever Translation of the Annals into English, book 1 of 2 book set.","Here is part one of the first major translation of the Annals of Ireland by the Four Masters into English. The large folding Irish family location map is in volume two, also available on Amazon. The set contains all the original text first published in 1846 by Connellan, including the four color 'cover' page at the front of the book. If you have an appreciation for Irish history, Connellans translation was part of the Irish revival in the mid-19th century, and a fitting work for any collection. If your budget is tight you can go with part one only. I would recommend getting volume 2 as well, for it contains the map and the new family name index for the map."
4,Survival Basis DVD,"Enjoyed the dvd. The commentators outfit was a bit strange, but overall great survival techniques that everyone can use in emergencies. Would recommend."
4,Warning-Hardcore Death Metal,This band is as death metal as it gets. Obviously its not mainstream but it does provide several different sounding and entertaining tracks. If I had to compare it to another band it would be exhumed.Buy this CD if you like ANY deathmetalDo not buy this CD if you think slipknot is deathmetal
5,A Trainer's Dream Come True!,"This book is an ideal tool for the corporate trainer that wants to improve communication, understanding, leadership and delegation among the various generations in the workplace. Wally - the subject of the book is the perfect example of how an employee can join our company and with the absence of good direction, boundaries and leadership; create chaos in a matter of days. These challenges are typical of the company who hasn't addressed methods for effectively managing the four generations present in today's workplace. I plan to use the book as a short, interactive play during our next training session. Involving the employees will help to develop an understanding of the inter-generational issues in the workplace, plus they will get to know each other on a different level, thus creating a sense of teamwork. This is so timely for today's workplace!"
2,switcheroo,"I ordered the light picture and was sent one with a plastic hamdle that is held on by a wing nut to the back of the screw that holds the glass frame.Plastic melts at high temperatures and I am not sure how long it will last. The reflective inner part of the lamp also distorts the light so that the light is very uneven. I do not like to be ""bait and switched"" so buyer beware, you might also get the old swtcheroo."
2,Very hot,These things are definitely on the cheap side and run extremely hot. I make sure I only run it for under 10 minutes at a time and I'm sure they'd set on fire anything that got near them. I would never leave this thing unattended. I'm using it to help me paint walls and right now searching for something of better quality.
4,"Works fine, no issues","I was hesitant to buy this reading everyone else's reviews, but I'm glad I did. I've probably used it for at least 30 hours, often 5-6 hours at a clip, and the bulb still works great (at the time I bought it, the reviews indicated if it lasted 5 hours you were lucky).Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that its noticeably a bit cheap, and doesn't seem like it would hold up very long with daily use and travelling to job sites. If you just need it once in awhile for small jobs around the house, its perfect though.UPDATE - Just used it for a full weekend of painting. Was probably on for about 20 hours over the weekend, and still going strong. Unit gets really HOT, but no more so than any other light like this. Would definitely recommend the bang for the buck."
4,"Cheaply made, but works","My first impression while putting it together was its very cheaply made, but it works well. I use it mainly for camping and it worked fine even after bouncing around in a box on the back of my trailer going down bumpy dirt roads. I plugged it into the generator and it lit up my whole camp site. Its nice to warm your hands on too LOL"
1,Useless bulb,"This unit arrived without a working bulb. I still haven't been able to get another, so the unit has been worthless. At $8-$9 for the entire unit, it almost isn't worth getting the bulb itself--might as well get an entirely new unit, except for the sour taste in my mouth from the first."
3,Buy extra bulbs,"I bought one of these on sale for 5 bucks which was a deal I couldn't pass up. Unfortunately the bulb burned out in 3 days in a mostly stationary position. When I went to remove it the ceramic insulation on one contact was in pieces, and the other cracked. The cord is very short and is meant to be used with an extension cord. There is no on/off switch either - this is a pretty bare bones work light but that's why it's cheap."
2,What a disapointment!!!,"We were so hoping that this would work on our dogs for ticks. All the reviews looked like it was exactly what we needed. But, disregarding the fact that it smells absolutely horrible, it didn't work for us. The dogs stink and they still have the ticks. Ugghhh!!! So frustrating."
2,Improperly Identified Product,"This item was not specified as a ""Livestock"" product in the advertisment. I purchase hoping to use on family pets and found that the Livestock product sent has been know to kill cats and dogs."
5,Rigorous and Lucid,"I wish I had this book on hand during my course in combinatorics. It is a must-have introduction for math undergrads and the general public alike. (Never let the price of a mathematics book fool you. Like a classical music CD, the value of the a math book is entirely determined by its content.) It is lucidly written, which is critical for this ostensibly simple field. Fuzzy explanations can lead readers far astray; poor examples can obscure key concepts. Michael Tucker's ""Applied Combinatorics"" suffers from this very problem. However, this is not so with Chen and Koh's volume. They are kind enough to provide multiple combinatorial proofs for a considerable number of problems, and they do so in the familar AMS format. There are an abundance of problems at the end of each chapter. Their chapters on Inclusion-Exclusion and recurrence relations shine brightly. Pick it up now!"
5,A Celebration of Seven Generations of Strong Women!,"I found this book to be simply inspirational. Hearne sets up a time line of sorts, depicting seven strong, determined women from her heritage who are rugged yet feminine and caring. Each woman differs remarkably in her interest and education, but is portrayed as a positive and vital part of the family. The focus on the wars through out the lives of these women demonstrates the integral part women played on the homefront, more often than not with out the credit they deserved. This is a book that would spark interest in female readers who might not otherwise be curious about their own heritage."
5,Seven Brave Women,"A book that tells the story of a family over generations, shows strong women, and expresses an unapologetic, matter of fact opposition to war would be of interest if it were not so well done. But it is well done. Telling the stories in the voice of the author's daughter is brilliant, tying the past to the future.The illustrations are absolutely gorgeous.I have bought copies of this book for my nieces and great-nieces, from adult to infant (OK, the infants will have to grow a bit before they understand, but even they like the pictures.) I think it would be good for the boys to read it, too, but I think that would be a harder sell."
1,"Not educational, not worth the money","We love Bill Nye videos but this is not at all up to the quality we had hoped for or expected and DEFINITELY not worth the money. Is very very short-- about 10 minutes of educational content, no real teaching, and a lot of goofy little repititive slogans said over and over again. Introduces some math concepts by name (fractions, proportions, etc) but doesn't actually teach about them at all-- skip this one!"
2,Very Disappointing.,Not the Bill Nye I and my students grew to love as Bill Nye the Science Guy! Wouldn't recommend it.
4,an introduction to government,"Eagles and Johnston have constructed a great text for an introduction into government. This text discusses parliamentary government, bicameralism, federalism, separation of powers, totalitarianism, organized interests, elections, etc... However, this book is probably not suitable for a student with an existing knowledge of politics and the United States government."
5,Essential Standard Reference about Episcopal Church,"This annually revised book is the essential standard reference about the Episopcal Church -- essential for active Episcopalians and valuable in any significant reference library. More than half of the book consists of three- or four-page directories of each diocese, with lists of 7,300 congregations in the church. It also describes the agencies and work of the national church, and that is especially valuable in this year when the 73d trienniel general convention of the church meets in Denver. About a third of the book is a directory of 14,700 bishops, priests and deacons. There is thorough coverage of the place of the Episcopal Cnurch in the Anglican Communion and in the National and World Council of Churches. Finally, there are 40 pages of informative and helpful advertisements. A new feature for 2000 is e-mail addresses and web sites for many dioceses, agencies and congregations."
4,"Great game, but needs more of the original","This game is great and has great fighting styles, but a lot of it is just skill in passing through obstacles. You don't fight with enemies all the time, as in previous titles.It's very entertaining, though, and if this title is to be played, it is worthwhile on the Wii, because of its interactivity with the remote controls, as you need the remote and the nunchuck.I gave it a 4 out of 5, because it fell a little short from the original series of all-the-time-fighting action."
3,Gotta love TMNT,"I was a huge TMNT fan when I was growing up so this game was a must for me. It's a good game, obviously not the best but if your a huge fan of TMNT you must play it!"
3,Too Tough to figure out,We bought this game for my 6 year old son. He perpetually gets stuck in the same place. Would recommend it for older 9 + kids.
3,OK at best,"Controls are ""interesting"" at best.Not as fun as I'd hoped it would be.Should have listened to the reviews for the game.In short, definitely a rental."
3,OK AT BEST,OK AT BEST CAMERA ANGLES SUK KINDA CONFUSING AT TIMES BUT FOR KIDS A GREAT GAME GRAPHICS ARE KOOL ..........
5,Friday,A must have collection that will keep you rolling on the floor laughing. It is way to funny to miss.
4,Great Deal,This series was HILARIOUS. Plus it is 4 movies for the price of one. What more can you ask for?
5,funny movie,this is a funny movie I now have all the movies ICE CUBE has ever made think he is a very good ACTOR. shipping was fast will buy again
1,ice cube collection : 4 film favorites,"so i ordered this product to be shipped to australia, only to recieve the item and not be able to play the dvd as is a US dvd which does not work in AU. disapointed as this was not made clear upon ordering. a shipment payed for and recieved for nothing really!"
2,Mike Epps is the reason this collection won't remain in my collection -,"I'm not looking for nor was I expecting anyone to fill Chris Tucker's shoes but this is just awful. I watched most of Next Friday head in hands. With the imdb rating of Friday After Next being lower than next Friday and the ""Benjamins"" rating being equal to that, I'm going to just quit while I'm ahead.Mike Epps may be good at stand-up - I don't know - but in film he is all sorts of irritating."
3,"Great Classics, yet Poor Packaging!","This set includes 4 of Ice Cubes classic hit movies on DVD format. While this is a great deal, the inside of the case does not have individual flaps for each DVD. Instead, all 4 of the DVD's are crammed into the same spot stacked on top of each other where they get easily scatched! Other movie sets I have purchased in one case offer page flaps to turn for each disc."
5,Friday's Funny Again,"Ice Cube stars in some of the funniest movies I have ever seen, the Friday series. I mean these movies will genuinely make you laugh out loud and HARD. Chris Tucker and Tiny Lister are guest stars with many more. Some of the funniest comedy ever. I MEAN IT."
1,meh,im sure your all going to say im doing it wrong but the 1 thing i can do well is make up a lather and this was hard to lather up it smells like citronella and the large bubbles never went away it was light and not very slipery no matter the water amount if you want cheap shaving soap spend an extra 1 dollar and get van der hagen your face will appreciate it
2,You get what you pay for,"It works OK, but requires an inordinate amount of time to get a decent lather. It is also fast to dry and doesn't provide much cushion during the shave. I'm no expert, but everything else I have tried has been better.It smells nice, I used mine for hand soap after three shaves with it."
1,lousy lather,"Been wet shaving about a year now and like it. I have been using Col Conk but ran out and picked this up cheap at the local CVS. Again, I find that you get what you pay for in life and this was lousy but cheap. Work hard to lather and it will dry up before you can pick up your razor and go to it. Only good thing is there is no soap ring around the sink, since the lather will evaporate. It sizzles like alka-selzer in a glass of water! I will stick to Col Conk, might try Van der Hagen since it gets good reviews on here. I really didn't mind the smell and never got any comments from the wife or kids on that, so I can't say that it smells bad. That's my advice."
2,Not for me.,I gave it a good old college try. The smell although; I couldn't get over the smell. I smelled like a citronella candle apparently to my girl. It also seemed to be a bit difficult to lather as well. It as well feels like it dried out my skin as well.I tried it. It was cheap. I didn't like it. Oh well. Trash it went.^ Awesome 12:15AM review.
1,Beware Shipping!,"It is a good product and the price is great. I wanted to order 10 bars but almost fell off my chair when I saw the shipping, $40!! Talk about a bait and switch."
1,Horrible!!!,I got the WORST razor burn using this shaving soap (using a new blade)!Got a better shave using a bottle of conditioner.I shave with a Merkur de safety razor.
2,Not for me,"I've only used this soap and the van der hagen. Out of the two so far I would use the van der hagen. This soap works and I picked it up at a local store. I can get it to lather alright. The problem is that it dries too quickly after applying. It seems like it has about 15 seconds, after using my brush, to shave with and then reapply. Otherwise I get razor burn. I just recently discovered that this is my problem with razor burn. As long as I reapply every quarter of my face before shaving or more frequently reapplying, the soap works fine. I would prefer a soap I can put on once or twice and shave my entire face though, so I will continue to look for something else."
4,Williams Mug,"I get it at Fred's for $1. I wear friendly mutton chops, so all I shave is my chin and throat, but for that I use shave soap and an old safety razor. Good stuff for a buck and it smells really nice"
3,okay,it's cheap. it smells like a cross between a urinal cake and lemon pez.the lather isnt that good but it's usable.
3,Cheaper at CVS,"I am not commenting on the quality of the soap. I just bought it a few hours ago - because I have a trip and wanted something cheap to travel with. Well it was $1.75 at CVS for the penny pinchers out there...this might not be the deal you are looking for.UPDATE: Someone wanted my review on the soap - I give it an, OKAY in a pinch. There are worse out there - but definitely not the best/my favorite."
2,Not for my sensitive skin,"I used this product for about 2 years before trying the more moisture rich creams by Proraso, Erasmic, Speick and the like. I have very sensitive skin and have always gotten pretty bad razor burn from this product regardless of blade types used. To me this product feels like nothing more than plain old soap lathered on the face.For sensitive skin folks I would try other products.For folks with non-sensitive skin this product may work well for you. The big pluses for this product are the price and the fact that it lasts a long time. In a 2 year period I have used less than half of the bar making this a great money saving item."
4,Yet another talented band from Oxford...,"The first time you listen to this album, you think yeah, OK, nice English jangle-pop. The second time around, you notice things that make you think ""This is really rather lovely"". The third time around, you think ""Wow"". A couple of songs aren't up to the rest; but the rest are subtly passionate and understatedly beautiful. Self-deprecating humour and an awareness of the poignancy of small things are mixed with the simple joy of a nice hook in the lead guitar. ""Knock Knock Who's There"" is blissfully bouncy; the power of ""What She Said"" makes it a standout track because of its immediacy; but ""My Divorcee"" is the finest of all because it has all these things and tells a story too."
4,good detail,Interesting book on a small community. This book is well written and moves well. This is not for a person just wanting to breeze through some basic information about Albanians. For a person interested in research about the balkans and looking for greater detail this book is a good buy.
2,Does not fit Brinkmann 4240,"I have a Brinkmann 4240 grill. Eventhough discription says it is should replace the cast iron burner in this grill, the mounting area is not compatible, there are no mounting screw holes, no ignitor mounting holes. Thankfully Amazon allowed me to return the item."
4,Not to shabby,"The neoprene sleave is a little thin, but stiching is reinforced and seems to be strong. Fit well and stays in place. Even adds a little more cushion on the check rest."
1,I would rate lower if a lower rating existed,"I have this book because it is requred for the course in computer architecture I am taking. In addition to the stuff the other guys above wrote which is all true, it has the infuriating habit of placing figures overleaf the explanation for the figures."
1,Look elsewhere,"If this book is required for your class, PLEASE buy a different book. This book offers little to no explanation of key topics, is very poorly written, and is hard to follow. In many cases, you will be better off simply reading Wikipedia. If you go to a school that requires this book, I would advise you to write angry letters to the people who decided to use it until they submit to your whim. By choosing this book, they have ruined an entire semester of class for you. How does that make you feel?"
1,Everything and worse,"All the bad reviews are true. This book is abysmal. It's painful to read. It is horribly written. Even worse, within two months, the binding on my brand new copy fell apart. It's criminal the publisher ask $100+ for this trash. Professors need to boycott this book - FAST! Do your students a favor and use the Roth books and/or just make-up your own notes. UPDATE: To the credit of the bookstore manager where I purchased this book and the publisher, my copy was replaced with a new one after I showed them how much it had fallen apart in such a short time even with normal use."
1,Awful,"If you can possibly avoid it, don't buy this book. If you can't possibly avoid it, remember to use the internet. The internet is 3000 times better at things than this book is.Also, realize that even the problems in this book have continuous typos so if your TA grades you as wrong, check to make sure you are doing the same problem their solution book solved. I wish we could rate this book without a star."
1,"Poor desing, poor support DO NOT BUY","This unit is designed very poorly. The gears bust, and are no longer available.This is like owning a ferrari, it is always broken, always fails on you, and you cannot get parts for it, so it is worth nothing to you."
3,White Mountain Ice Cream maker,The Ice Cream maker is great but the Made in China really shows through. The lock down handle for the motor BROKE OFF after two uses!
4,Does the job.,Powerful but noisy motor. Needs fiddling with to get clamp to hold motor in place but once everything is all set it does the job in about 20-25 min. 6 qt. capacity means you use about 3 qts. of liquid and end up with about 4 qts. of frozen product. Best of its type; I'd buy again.
3,THEY TOO SOON WORN OUT.,"I MAKE A GOOD BIT OF HOMEMADE ICE CREAM, AND USE ONLY THE WHITE MOUNTAIN. SOME DON'T LAST TOO LONG. THEY BEGIN TO LEAK GREASE, WHICH CAN SEEP INTO THE BARREL.THE MOTORS BEGIN TO GRIND, AND RESULT IN A JERKING MOTION OF THE MACHINE. APPROXIMATELY 6 OF THESE MACHINES HAVE WORN ME OUT. OVER-PRICED FOR THE TIME USED."
2,For the price it should last,"I bought one of these last year and it worked very well for the first three times, then the gears broke. It costs $149.00 for a new motor, which is What you have to buy because you can't get the gear assembly by itself. the motor is fine but of no use without the gears. By the way there out of replacement motors."
1,Junk - 1 batch of ice cream cost $214,"Tried to use it Sunday for a big July 4th party. Had wonderful batch of fresh peach ice cream that everyone was excited to try. It was purchased June 2009 for last July 4th party and worked wonderfully. Has been stored indoors in original packaging so it hasn't been misused. Plugged it in this year and it screamed. All attempts to correct the issue didn't work. Appears to be power shaft coming out of the motor. After researching return policy, purchasing of parts and reading other reviews, I realized that there's nothing that can be done. So much for attempting to purchase a quality product rather than a cheap plastic freezer. Don't purchase unless you're willing to have only a few batches of very expensive ice cream."
1,Made Ice-cream once and then motor broke,"[...]6 quart white mountain electric ice cream makerAfter breaking the 2nd time it was used, calling white mountain, researching & looking at reviews, White mountain company was bought out and their product isn't quality like it used to be. I have had my white mountain ice cream maker for about 25 years...I think they need to make their parts in the USA they are assembled here but parts are not from USA. It was less than a month when the motor broke so they refunded my money but disappointing. I bought it as a gift for my daughter & her husband who were looking forward to homemade ice-cream . Hopefully white mountain can improve their product."
1,JUNK,"Bought this used it one time worked good the second time the gears tore up 200.00 plus out the window dont buy this icecream maker.For the price it should last for a new motor, which is what you have to buy because you can't get the gear assembly by itself. the motor is fine but of no use without the gears. By the way there out of replacement motors"
1,not worth the money,We boought this white mountain 6 quart freezer for our lake property. Used it 2 times and the motor went bad. New motor costs $149.00. To expensive to replace so we junked it and bought a least expensive ice cream maker. It works so much better than the Ice Mountain did. Would definetly not recomend this to anybody.
4,Small is Beautiful,"I bought two of these because I wanted my daughters (ages 10 & 11) to be able to listen to radio without having to be ""plugged-in"" with headphones all the time. (I hate seeing people plugged-into iPods, MP3 players, cell phones, etc.) The radio has a neck strap, so my daughters can be a little fashionable wearing an electronic device as an accessory.For a 1-inch speaker, the sound is pretty good. If you do happen to plug-in a set of headphones, the sound is excellent and in stereo.We have had excellent durability with the radios. The two AAA batteries last quite a while. The clock and alarm work well, as does the digital tuning. Cool little radios for not much money! [Note: this radio comes in an Orange version as well.]OTHER OPTIONS: The analog-tuned Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio (approx. $10); or the larger and better sounding Sony ICF38 Portable AM/FM Radio (approx. $20) that runs on a built-in power cord (or batteries)."
2,"works well for am, but very small, display broke","I bought this for the bathroom, and it is really meant for a pocket with earphones. FM only works if you attach an antenna they provide. AM works ok. The size is smaller than I expected, and thus the buttons are very small. The memory recall button is tiny, and I have to use a finger nail to push it. Speaker sound is reasonable for the size. update 2 yrs later: display broke and shows cryptic symbols, yet radio still works using memory only to tune."
2,pii am/fm radio,"I have puchased 2 of these and found a Sony walkman that outperforms it in all ways. while iqin radio satisfied my needs initially, the sony did a better job. each of the pii performed differently in their features."
1,Piece of Junk,Beware - this is a very cheaply made radio from China. Dials don't work well. Reception poor. I sent it back. Piece of Junk !
1,There should be a support group...,"...for the Adult Survivors who were forced to watch this movie as children. I have horrid memories of this film, which scared the cr*p out of me as a kid. It's nothing more than a horror film, christian theme or not. It is most certainly NOT SUITABLE FOR KIDS!!!Know how I found this on Amazon? I was surfing the net for any theraputic articles I could find about residual psychological damage done by this film and it's sequel, the even more disturbing ""A Distant Thunder.""Myself and several friends LEFT THE CHURCH when we grew up, partly because of the horrible, horrible emotional scars left by this film. I am not kidding here.At least this one didn't feature people getting their heads chopped off like the sequel does!My advice? See for yourself- IF you're over 18 and have access to therapy afterwards. You're gonna need it."
3,one of my all-time favorites,"russell doughten is a genius. he taught acting in hollywood, studied at yale school of drama, and made these cult classics which resonated in the 70's. i was blown away seeing these at Christian youth rallies and baptist churches as a kid. i'm making movies in hollywood now, and i still watch these flicks for inspiration. i think russell made films that scared the hell out of people, with a sincere motivation to see them saved. his detractors may say they are dated and campy, but like ed wood, the films outlive their detractors. russell got them made and shot on 16mm in the middle of iowa, a greater achievemnet than his critics."
5,The 70's-80's Left Behind!!!,"Having finally purchaased and the Thief In The Night collection earlier on this year, having watched and loved more current prophecy classics such as Apocalypse 1-4, The Moment After, Left Behind 1 &2, SIX: the Mark Unleashed and the Gathering, I have to say that the entire series deserves a 5 simply for paving the way for and inspiring many of the later prophecy movies(including those that I've just mentioned), and for having a 70's to 80's, MOD Squad & Knightrider-ish feel that you have to love. TRUE, the production, action, acting, and efx were amateur at best, but the message is POWERFUL, the stroyline is captivating, and let's face it, this series has elements of all of the more recent prophecy films and books(Apocalypse, Left Behind, Omega Code,etc) rolled into one. So I have one word for this whole series...FOUNDATIONAL!!!"
3,"Cheap, amateurish & powerful primal raw C'tian cinema!","Forget the LEFT BEHIND movies, this is the genuine B-grade Christian horror film of all time. I'm still a Christian, tho no longer a Rapturist, and I gotta admit the THIEF IN THE NIGHT series still packs a wallop. It's cheaply made, amateurishly acted, and simplistically written, but it has a profound raw earnestness of sheer primal emotional power. Same with the three sequels A DISTANT THUNDER, IMAGE OF THE BEAST and PRODIGAL PLANET.The only such movies to come close- Michael Tolkin's THE RAPTURE (starring Mimi Rogers & David Duchovny- NOT a C'tianproduction *L* - a well-deserved R but must-viewing for mature C'tians); and Parts 2-4 of Cloud Ten Production's Apocalypse series- REVELATION (Jeff Fahey & Carol Alt), TRIBULATION (Gary Busey, Margot Kidder, Howie Mandel-?!?!) & JUDGMENT (Corbin Bersen, Mr. T), tho skip the original APOCALYPSE unless you're a completist."
1,A terrible christian propaganda movie,"This is a film for christian fundies. The subject matter is of course total nonsense, like anything else religious. The acting is about as wooden as a tree, in fact I've seen trees act better than some of these so called actors. Of course fundies have been preaching the end times for what seems an eternity & this film is the grand father of the current book & film resurgence that has taken place in the increasingly theocratic USA. Mind you I did like the UNITE acronym 'United Nations Imperium of Total Emergency'"
4,Rapture,"He is coming and you need to be ready...This is a good video to watch.It scared me as a child,because I was afraid to be left behind.."
5,Still Powerful,"Many of these films were shot in my hometown &/or home church. I saw several of their films as I was growing up.Now as a youth worker in Young Life, I have shown these to the kids in our club. They are as impacted by the powerful message of this movie as I was growing up.It really makes you step back, take a look at your life, and determine which things are really, truly important in the END...thus impacting the NOW."
2,didn't hold charge,Battery doesn't hold charge for 2 hours like it should I'm lucky to get 1 hour...
1,no street grindin please!,"this season, for the new movie, they made two different sets of the ninja turtles. there's the street grindin, and then the regular ones that dont do anything fancy. my son got raph for his birthday, and no one at the party could figure out how to make him grind. yes there was drinking, but even after that still never got him to shoot across the floor. we did, however manage to lose ALL of his body parts, so his torso remains after a month. all of my son's other turtles are not the street grindin' and have not lost any body parts. for some reason, they made this line differently, and arms and legs and heads just come off. AND no grindin. will NOT buy another one EVER. i WILL buy the regular ones if he manages to lose one."
2,Disappointed in this book,My day care children did not seem to enjoy this book. It did not hold their interest. I have other Karen Beaumont books and love them. I was a bit disappointed in this one.
4,Fun Book,Good age group for this book is probably 4ish to 8ish. I have kids that are six and seven and they both get a kick out of the book. Makes a nice gift.
5,Absolutely perfect!,"I am so pleased with this clock. It is exactly what I wanted. I love the colors, the size and the glazed ceramic finish. Worth every dime!"
5,Excellent!,Superb. Four original scenes. Opener features Avy Scott and Alexis Texas. Kissing is non-stop with nudity and touching shown in profile. Definitely worth it .
3,From Back Cover,"He'd slipped in and out of hostile nations, stared down enemy guns. But Chance Barnette Connelly, navy SEAL, didn't know fear until he was caught in the sights of one petite, green-eyed single mom.Jennifer Anderson sent a jolt of desire through the long-lost Connelly son, one that begged to be satisfied. With his navy whites, tanned skin and killer good looks, Chance always got what he wanted. But while Jennifer and her adorable baby let him into their home, she vowed he'd never get into their hearts. This time the things Chance wanted just might be out of his control - a place to call home... a woman to come home to... a family.4th in the ""Dynasties: The Connellys"" series."
2,popcorn,"the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped, very small kernels and scorched the bottom of my new whirley popper. I've had several poppers and this is the first time one has scorched and the first time I've used the Wabash corn. shipping charges were very high for a relatively inexpensive corn."
3,Popcorn was alright,"The Popcorn was delivered as promised in an attractive wrapper. I used the Whirley Pop popcorn maker and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and popped it according to the instructions of the whirley popper. While the majority of the kernels popped, there was also a large amount of 'seeds' or residue that can get caught in your teeth and are somewhat distracting while you're eating. I actually got better results using Orville Redenbacher White Popcorn Kernels in the Whirley Popper (and it was actually cheaper at the local market). Overall I give Amish Country 3 out of 5 stars and mostly for the presentation of the package than for the yield results."
1,amish popcorn,worst popcorn ive ever bought. chewy not fluffy. gave it to the birds for bird food. postage was outrageous! just not a good experience all around. wont be buying from them ever again.
3,dissappointed,"I was disappointed. I thought being Amish and according to the advertising that it would be exceptional. But it's just popcorn, no better than others I've purchased. So, so. I would not buy it again."
4,Very good popocorn,"My doctor told me I must eat ""hulless"" popcorn if I have popcorn at all. Because I can't give up my favorite snack, I bought this Wabash Famnily Farms Amish Country popcorn. The kernels are tiny, but they pop well, although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn I get from the grocery store. It tastes great, however, and has fewer and smaller hulls. I don't think there is such a thing as completely hulless,but Ido notice thst I don't get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore."
5,Spoiled me for other popcorn,"Use olive oil to cook this, salt it well, and it is the best, most tender popcorn I have ever eaten. I add a tiny bit of butter to mine, but don't need it. My nine year old daughter didn't like popcorn until she reluctantly tried this. After a few bites, she consumed half the bowl!I bought mine at a specialty popcorn shop in Long Grove IL, so I didn't have to pay shipping costs, but when it's gone, I might have to bite the bullet and order it from here."
3,Heed the advice on hot air poppers,"Wish I would have read the reviews that discuss the product's performance in hot air poppers. The PC is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth...4 stars.Problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop. Tilting the machine helps keep them inside, but it would be simpler just to find another larger kernel corn."
4,Amish Country Baby White Popcorn,"We've enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the Movie Theater Popcorn. It's light and fluffy - tender - and delicious. I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no ""palm"" oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out. It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more."
2,average taste,"Popcorn has grear color (white) But taste is average and due to shipping costing more then product, I would not buy again."
5,Microwave Popcorn,"I bought this for my daughter's new microwave popcorn popper as a Christmas gift, and she says that it is delicious, but pops up smaller than other popcorn. She likes it a lot."
5,Best Popcorn Ever,"This was the sweetest, smallest, hulless, best tasting white popcorn I have ever had. Just placed an additional order for a 6 lb. bag as well as other varities carried by this company."
4,Good Stuff,"I love little white kernels of popped corn. This was good stuff, but I think I'll try a larger white kernel to pop next time, my preference."
2,Pop Corn,"This popcorn popped to very small kernels and was almost like,me refuse of the corn. I would not recommend it at all."
4,"Popcorn is wonderful, but the way it was packaged was disappointing","Shipping the package of popcorn, at a price way beyond what I'd pay in the store, caused concern to repeat the purchase. The reason why is the bag was completely busted open loose inside the box. Because it was a Christmas gift to our daughter I scooped it all up and put in a canning jar with a ribbon so she would get it on the 25th. Otherwise, I would have sent it back, at the price, and requested a new package."
3,Baby white popcorn,It's good popcorn but not the best of what I have tried.I like the small popcorn the best but this corn wasn't the best.I started mixing this popcorn with my favorite so I like it this way much better.
1,Item arrived damaged,I bought this item as a gift ....but when it arrived the bag had a huge tear down the side and the loose kernels were all spilled out into the box.......I know the product is good as my sister uses nothing else but I cannot give a rating as I wouldnt use it and it was thrown away
3,Gourmet popcorn not what I hoped for,"This product does not live up to its name, I'm afraid. Though it has a pretty good flavor it pops up very small with many unpopped kernels. The bag contained many broken and defective kernels. I will eat what I have but I would not buy this product again."
3,Okay but there's much better,"This is my first time trying Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Baby White.Pros: It's okay with a nice mild nutty flavor. The hulls are more pronounced than with some other Amish ""Baby White.""Cons: It tends not to briskly pop up. In fact, we've burned several pans because popping it is tricky. We found that the microwave often works better than pan popping. And as mentioned above, the hulls are much more noticeable than with other Amish ""Baby White"" brands.We purchased these 6 bags and we'll use them up but won't be ordering any more. Next time we'll drive the long distance to our nearest Amish store."
2,This is not hull-less popcorn! Or even close.,"Bought 6lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this Baby White than on regular popcorn. Not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn, the corn pops up so tiny that it's about 1/3 hull, 2/3 popped corn per kernel! I was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls.I popped this using every tip I could find on the internet; all experiments still resulted in a tough hull."
3,Received wrong product,"Received the ""Baby Yellow"" instead of the correct ""Baby White"" kernels. Unable to return the product since it's a grocery item, but Amazon.com customer service did an excellent job and provided a full refund. As far as can tell, no other issues with product."
4,"Pops well, not much flavor","I liked the idea of the small popcorn. It pops up really well in the popper but it doesn't have much if any ""popcorn"" flavor. Was pretty bummed by that."
4,A Caveat,"The popcorn itself is yummy, just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper. The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped. It's great in the microwave or a pan, but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper."
2,Tasty popcorn but kernels too small for a hot air popcorn popper,"Tasty, small kernel popcorn. However, too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper. The kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped."
2,Information way to general to be much help.,"The information is this book is accurate, I'm sure. It is, however, way too general to be of much help. It gives pros and cons for different types of items (pros and cons of laminate flooring, tile, carpet...for example). But there's no ""meat"" to speak of. It gives not even a general reference to pricing or cost of installation. I just find that everytime I try to reference something in the book (we are currently builing a home) I have to go to another resource to answer my question. This book is never sufficient. Hope this was helpful."
5,Super Simian Game!,"This game is great!The storyline is excellent, graphics amazing-- one heck of a cool game!I do feel that if you are six through eight you may need a little help mastering the control but you will learn with ease. Smooth controls, voice-overs really fit the characters, it's good fun for the whole family. Also, the little minnie games are fun. Four games in one! Ape Escape it's self, a sking game, a boxing game (with kid-friendly graphics) and a spaceship game. This game is great... I higly recomend it! See ya gamers!"
4,I recommend this classic. ^^,"It has been years since I got to play the demo that was released for this title and to say the least, I had procrastinated long enough to finally buy it now and it's most certainly a creative and fun game. It arrived quickly and in the condition promised. I recommend it for people who play the Sony PlayStation and it's counterparts often. ^w^"
4,Ape Escape sets the pace,"the original Ape Escape set the standard for all that followed. Great entertainment, games, and movies are embedded. Fun, fun, fun."
5,One of my favorite games!!!,"This game is so cool!! You play using Spike and youy go through time catching apes. Although the graphics aren't the best I've seen, and one of the mini games is lame. This game is still one of my favorites along with Spyro 2, and NBA LIVE 2001. Get this Game!!!"
4,"Good, but kind of easy","I saw this game, and it looked amusing, so I got it. I soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game I had played in the past. It's really fun, and you get hooked on it. Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus. The problem was the camera (which could really be annoying at some times) and the challenge. Here's my tip: If you're an advanced gamer, 12 or older, rent this game, but do not buy. Most 11 year olds, and even some 10 year old have found this game easy. But if you're younger than that, you'll go ape over this game."
2,Only ok,"This game to me, wasnt that much fun. Pretty much all you do is try to catch monkeys, and after a while it isnt fun. I would highly suggest you try out this game before you actully buy it.This game just starts to get a little bit tired. Thanx for looking at this review. Hope it was helpful."
1,My poor eyes....,"I'm sorry but I regret getting this game. First off, no more playstation one games for me. The graphics are subpar, the game play glitchy, and I cannot get the hang of using all the tools. This game is NOT enjoyable, not clever, and just plain miserable. I think if they did a ps2 version with better graphics and game play it would be interesting. There are far better games (PS TWO) if you shop around."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"This game is a lousy, sad waste of time, money, and more time. It was a waste of the 5 min. I spent boring myself. Do not by this game, if your looking for a game that is actualy worth opening that good for nothin' plastic wrapper stuff find something else."
1,I am not sold. . .,"While reviewing this game, I was surprised to see in the opening scenes, monkeys carrying clubs and machine guns. I will not pay for violent games. There's no need to encourage guns, hitting and violence. It's being returned to the store tomorrow!"
4,"I love this game, it's so cool!",I like this game because there are so many things to track apes down and capshure apes. you will have a hole lot of fun with this game. I would say it is good for ages 7 & up. so if you get this game I now you will not regret it!
3,Not so great after removing rose-tinted goggles,"Many years ago, I played this game at a demo station and wished that I had gotten a PS instead of an N64. Having recently gotten a PS1 memory card for my PS2, I decided to get this game which I had very much wanted. I started it up, and... the game hasn't aged well. It's full of good ideas and originality, but the draw distance is pitiful and really diminishes the sense of exploration, and it sticks to some very outmoded design conventions.If you're interested in videogame history, however, this is a fascinating game, as it shows what early attempts were made to justify having two analog sticks"
4,Different,"This book is rather different than the comic books. In that Batman, painted by Alex Ross, is portrayed as if he were real. In the comic book Batman/Bruce Wayne is supposed to be in his mid 30's yet he looks as if he were carved by the hands of Michelangelo. Whereas in this book he looks more in synch with a large man in his mid 30's with thinning hair, portly physique etc. The costume is also more realistic in the comic book (as in all comic books) the fabric seems to mould every muscle of the body. In this book the costume envelops the body more the way that clothes usually do.The story appears to fall more realistically than the comic book too. I still prefert to read the comic books, but if you are a Batman fan this will make a nice addition to your collection."
3,The art is fantastic,What can you say about Alex Ross' art work except that it is always a feast for the eyes. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the story. Paul Dini has done some excellent work for the Batman comics and especially the animated series but this story didn't really grab me. I can't say I wasted my money because the pictures are fantastic but you make your own choice.
3,Good describes it,"This book was good, not great or bad. The art is fantastic, as everything Ross does. But the problems lie is the insignificance of the plot. Haven't we heard that story somewhere before? Robin anyone? Also, I don't like how Ross paints Bruce Wayne. I know he paints everything realistic, but Wayne isn't supposed to be that buff and not that tall. If you liked Superman: Peace On Earth, you'll probably like this enough for it to be worth buying"
2,"Great art, worthless story","Depending on your comic budget this might make sense. For me, this was a total waste. You'll read over this thing like once--maybe twice. Nothing like Kingdom Come... As other reviewers have said, nothing new here that we haven't heard before. Read this one in the comic store and walk away. Just...walk..away. Meanwhile, I'll be selling my copy in the auctions section. If you must buy a copy, buy mine."
3,Cuentos de hadas,"Esto no explica soluciones. El libro habla de un vecino rico. Lamento el comprar de esto. Compre Investing Without Losing (ISBN 0978834607 NOT on amazn, other stores)."
4,Cambia tu manera de pensar,"La traducción no es muy buena, pero la idea del autor es clara.Para mí, lo más importante del libro es que explica por qué nunca la clase media sale de las deudas y por qué el retiro (jubilación) es un tormento para tanta gente que ganó buenos salarios.Este libro le cambiará su manera de pensar."
3,"Buen libro, traduccion mediocre...","El libro es estupendo y me ha enseñado muchas cosas respecto al dinero. Creo que todos deberian leerlo. Le di un puntaje de 3 ya que, como hispanohablante y traductora, se me hizo dificil de leer en su version española. La traduccion suena a eso: una traduccion. Asimismo, note una cantidad un tanto alarmante de faltas de ortografia y errores gramaticales. Este libro se habria beneficiado de una edicion minuciosa. En fin, se puede leer si no hay mas remedio. De otro modo, recomiendo que lean su version original en ingles. (NOTA: Escribo sin acentos porque siempre se joroban :)."
4,Muy buen libro,Lo recomiendo totalmente es el comienzo de una serie de libros muy buenos que hablan de la manera en que piensan las personas con poder economico.
1,I'm Losing You,Oops . . . Mr. Wagner dropped the ball after an early promising start. His prose is so dense you need a knife to hack you way through. Skip it.
2,"A little less Bogg, A little more melody","Dressed like Brooklyn Hipsters and playing the music of drunken pioneers, you'd expect that if a band like this was going to cut an album (a rarity in itself) it would have to be something special. But in a market where Kitsch is a driving force in record sales, you can imagine the scene: Small record label operators debating amongst themselves-...Okay, sure the band doesn't have much material...and yes, many of the melodies are stolen from songs that were famous eons ago and dressed up a bit...but this band has a person inside the booklet that is actually listed as playing the ""stomp."" The Stomp! That's gold- that'll sell records....You know what? Your a genius.... Well thank you- END IMAGINATION ADVENTURE -Don't get the wrong idea, it's not that the Boggs don't have a few decent songs somewhere in this mix, but there just isn't enough material, or variation in that material, to make an album here..."
1,Not what is advertised,Its a basic vise grip but not the one that was advertised. mine came with no soft grips. I'm too lazy to return or complain to Amazon but it should be corrected.
5,Great Mitt,"I like this mitt for three reasons : I don't get burned ,I don't get burned ,I don't get burned . Other things that are good about this mitt are : The extra length on the forearm see reason number one . I have large hands and have a hard time finding one that fits . This one is snug however I've been cooking professionally for a long time now and like a snug mitt . ( my hand doesn't swim in it ) I believe a tighter mitt allows for more dexterity . Also I didn't find it so cumbersome I couldn't use it either . I have had no problems with the grips and/or gripping . Did I mention I don't get burned . Also the magnet is quite handy , I leave it stuck on the outside of the oven and it is right there , right where I need it . ( also do not have to worry about it getting hot or burning there as it is rated for high temps ) I will be purchasing another as soon as I finish this review . One other thing I might add ... I don't get burned !"
3,BEWARE of Sizing,Amazon does not offer a choice of sizes. They sent me petite which is too small for my hands. You might consider ordering from a site with sizes.
2,Oven Mitt,Would not buy again. The Mitt is too thick and inflexible. Difficult to grip smaller handles or to hold utensils.
2,Poor functionality for high temp mitt,"The mitt provides outstanding protection but it's too stiff and clumsy for regular use in the kitchen. I think it's best suited for moving grills, racks, etc."
3,Not good for smaller hands,"The mitt itself is quite nice, and certainly handles temperatures I wouldn't try with one of my older mitts.The problem is that it isn't designed for smaller hands. I'm a guy with fairly short fingers (not oddly so, just below average), perhaps typical size for a woman's fingers. The fingers on the glove are much too long to work well with smaller hands, and makes gripping with the glove a definite problem."
3,Not so hot,"The mit is good for insulation and I like the cuff that protects your wrist. However, it is molded flat, I suppose so it can be used in either hand. Consequently it doesn't conform to the shape of either hand and using it is difficult. In other words, the opposing thumb doesn't ""oppose"", but instead you have to sort of use the edge of it. I would get something else that has a shape ready to grab the edge of a pan instead of waving at traffic. Not worth the money."
2,Gives self-publishing a bad rep...,"I've heard the author speak. He may have a few good ideas, but both in his speaking and his writing, what surfaces more than anything is his know-it-all attitude. He's an author in the self-interested sense of the word and, unfortunately, it makes it hard to cut through to any of the good stuff he might have to say. Oh well...maybe next time Mike"
3,Not as good as season one.,"Still a good show, but not as good as the first season. Season one was more intense and the acting seemed more realistic."
5,"Best, most intense show I've ever seen","As a therapist with a doctorate in psychology, I can honestly say this show rings true. This is the hard work that goes on in therapy. However, as much as I like it I don't understand Byrne's laisez-fare treatment attitudes toward Michael and Sophie in the lst season...they are both clearly suicidal and the ""see you next week"" approach seemed very loose to me. Treating suicidal patients as out-patients should at least require twice a week connection. Other than that...is he really helping anyone?"
3,In Treatment season 2,I did not like the people who played the characters in this season. Diane Wiest was exceptional as usual. Disk 4 in my series wouldn't play and when I realized this my time with amazon to exchange for another copy had run out. I could have purchased it at my local Sams Club for less money and not waited a week to get it and they would have exchanged it no with no problem or hassle. So I am done buying from amazon I got screwed on the last two transactions with them.
4,wonderful series - a real 'page turner',"it was hard to not be entirely consumed by watching this series all at once. wonderfully acted, well filmed. the next season was the last, and I'm not surprised. He needed to get out and live his own life, and I was a little exhausted by all that he went through.... so the timing of the 'end' seemed right."
5,Real life--evaluated closely,"A most amazing series. Far from the typical drama with gunshots and sex scenes, Gabriel Byrne takes the viewer deep into the therapist's office, where all of our inner fears and doubts and loves are revealed. We are not all so different after all."
5,WOW,"I have never heard of the Susie Arioli Swing Band before. After listening to some samples, I thought I would take a chance and buy the CD. What a wonderful surprise. Susie Arioli has a unbelievable voice. I would put her up there with Diana Krall.The music selection is great and the arrangements are well done. Jordan Officer's guitar work is right on and complements Susie's singing. I love it and if a Cd can wear out, then this one will."
2,Stopped Working,"Used it about 5 or 6 times for the year and half I had it and then it stopped working completely! You know how a lot of times when you're using something and it makes some type of sound before it dies; Well not this one, it was working and then it just quit. Needless to say I'm out of the warranty, and money! Although I did NOT buy this through Amazon. I bought it through Ace Hardware online. Which reminds me of another product (some battery operated spray bottle that you don't have to keep pressing the trigger) Anyway that thing died on me too! In hindsight I do notice I got great deals when I purchased them, but of course that might have been the reason, it was really not too good of a deal to begin with! Wayne Arthur"
5,Good product,"This nail gun is great for what it is...a simple tool that handles simple tasks. I have had no problem nailing down baseboards, shoe rail, chair rail, and even attaching a few 6"" x 1"" boards to a few 2"" x 4"" boards (I was building legs for my fireplace mantle). I think only two out of a hundred nails didn't puncture all the way into the wood, and those were easily hammered in. Those two ""bad"" nails were my fault, as I got lazy and did not apply enough pressure on the backside of the gun, and the kick bounced the gun off the boards a little. If you're building a house, you might want a different nail gun. If you're updating a bathroom and a few other rooms inside the house, this nail gun is a good deal."
1,Did not work,"Item purchased through an Amazon 3rd Party trusted Vendor (Toby's Tool Shed). Right out of it's packaging this item did not work. I give this item the lowest possible score. Obviously, others could be a terrific purchase while mine was a defective model. I opted for something different."
1,Not reliable and company does not stand behind it,"After using for 8 nails, the unit completely shut down. No jams, just won't do anything. Now I have to pay to ship it back to FPC and hope they do the right thing? I found almost the exact same unit at Sears, by Craftsman, and know they will stand behind it. All electrics are for light duty, so if you need more, go with the air powered versions."
1,Surebonder 5950 Electric Nailer with Case,I strongly suggest that you do not purchase this product. I used it to attach a chair rail and some trim in one room. It worked fine for almost an hour and then I smelled smoke; it stopped working. I had to borrow a friends' nail gun in order to finish my project. Get yourself a compressor style nail gun and save yourself the frustration.
1,One nail and it quits.,"After one nail it quit working. I thought it was jammed but after checking, it was not jammed. It rattles inside, so I assume it has serious problems. One reviewer said it was a waste of time and money to ship it back to the manufacturer, so i guess I'm screwed! Buyer beware, this is a very poor product. One nail for $55.00? I'll go back to the regular hammer and nails."
1,did not work.,Did not work and warranty sucks. You are a fool to buy this product. It should be taken out of Amazon.
1,Stop working after couple use,"This nail gun is completely worthless. I used it for two times about 30 nails and it just stop working. I bought it two and a half months ago. Probably can't return it anymore. Stay clean from this piece of junk. When it was working, the nail wouldn't go all the way in, so I needed to use a hammer to finish the work."
2,Surebonder 5950 Electric Nailer,"I purchased this product to install quarter rounds in the bedroom. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I pressed on the gun, 90% of the nails wouldn't go all the way through. I was also disappointed in the return policy."
3,Falls Short,"Interestingly enough I found the first 6 chapters of the book and excellent intro to Java 2 concepts. After that, the books reading level sky rockets. I found myself enjoying everything untill it became to complicated to understand the authors examples. I had to read some chapters 3-4 times before I grasped the concept of what he was trying to explain. This is due to the authors assumption of the users pace. Dummies is meant to dumb down things at all times, this book fails that."
4,Perfect Tool,"Hi All,I bought this book to start learning programming, and even tough I had no previous experience on it, I can freely say it's really easy learning it with this book. Explanations are really clear and easy to understand. Moreover the author helps - through email - solving some problems you may encounter during the learning process. He's very patient and professional. I advice this book for everyone who wants to start programming from zero like me. Very helpful."
4,An alright intro book,"This book makes for a good introduction to Java 2, and it touches on many important methods and programming blocks, with easy to follow examples, but like the title implies its for the Java ignorant, a good follow up to this book for the newbie Java programmer would be a J2EE O'reilly edition."
1,Coal in a diamond mine,"I'm a big fan of dummies books, have used them for years, and recommend them to students. But this one is horrid. I'm an experienced programmer with some OOP experience, and I could not follow what he was talking about. The examples where parts were completely unexplained did not help. I don't buy books so I can reread sections three times and still not be sure what the author meant. I am looking elsewhere to learn Java, and I recommed you do the same."
3,Ok for the absolute beginer,"It covers all basic aspects, but that's all. It's not a bad book as long as you know what you're looking for. People knowing the basics should avoid it and search for something more detailed"
4,Sweet Story,"This is the story of the tough life of the settlers in early America. It was so well written it was hard to put down once I started. It was inspirational in that the hearts of the characters and their thoughts were what kept the story going. The happily-ever-after ending was disappointing to me after such a strong journey, but it would not stop me from recommending this book. Just caution to young believers that the peace that Jesus promises is in the heart and will not necessarily be manifested with the circumstances of an easy life."
4,Cool Book to LEARN from..,"This Teach Yourself book is the best. It actually does teach you VB 4 in 21 days.. depending on how long you work on it each day.The ONLY gotcha with this book is that they use some third party controls that you need to ""buy"" before you can complete the book (they recommend reading on even if you don't have the controls. I think I was able to substitute a few of the TegoSoft controls, but it was rather annoying that they didn't use the tools available in VB4 but chose to use some third party controls that were not available for evaluation, etc.Anyway, the third party control issue happens near the end of the book.. and it's still an awesome book despite this single shortcoming."
1,a disappointment,"The book is not recommended for serious VB programmers. It does not deal with real-world projects. You learn only a tiny fraction of VB with this book. The only good thing that you will learn from this book is the ability to create a VB project, type in code, execute and that's it!!"
1,One Lousy Book,"This book is ridiculously lousy and sloppy. It is concise, but to the point where valuble information is squeezed out dry. The reference card is ridiculously designed (instead of making a reference card of commands and methods and tools, they put in name conventions for controls and color codes). Another thing is when you read this book, you have to go VERY CAREFULLY so that you don't miss any commands or methods. Some books provide neat features like a shaded box entry in the chapters, with the listing of commands and what they do. This book is: Start a project, run it, look at the code, good...next!. I highly do not advise anyone to pick up this book. Such a big book for such little information."
2,Book for amateur in the worst sense of the word,"Purports to teach everything in 21 days, but barely skips over fundamentals. Sloppy design, information not concise - one does a lot of page turning to glean a valuable piece of information. Might be attractive to a beginner for making him feel like he is progressing along, but anyone with at least basic programming experience is left high and dry."
4,Enough to Scare the Crap out of you.,"I first saw this movie when I was (...) attending a right-winged conservative Baptist private school. I can honestly say that this movie scared me for life, aside from making me a full believer in God and Jesus. This movie gave me nightmares for years, and I will probably never be able to watch it again. However, if your past pueberty I'm sure its a good movie to watch for entertainment value, or maybe if your wanting to see a wholesome Christian movie aside to take a break from the schlock that Hollywood puts out nowadays."
1,scaring the bejeezus outta ya,"Oh yes, rest assured, there will be nightmares. There will also be a turning away from religion, and probably therapy in later years. Ask anyone in Generation X who saw this as children, when we were bused to churches in large crowds. These 4 movies are one major reason for our ""issues"" as a generation. We all lived in constant fear of 5 things: the Rapture, the Russians, the vampires, the aliens, and nuclear annihilation in World War III. Many of us grew up listening for cars & trains passing so we'd know the world hadn't ended yet, i.e., the Rapture hadn't yet come, but probably would tonight or tomorrow."
1,Slow paced scare propaganda,"This is the third ""A Thief in the Night"" movie. The production values are pretty good, but the story is confusing, jumping between subplots, but worst of all is the slow pace. While the previous movie was at least somewhat enjoyable, this one is just boring.These movies are scare propaganda for Christianity. Don't show them to kids, or they may suffer trauma, as some of the other reviewers here claim to have."
4,This Album is Tyght!,"Yo what up, this release have everything you need. You have your fast beats and mellow beats. You also have an all-star team of producers like: Tonex, Fred Hammond, Dawkins and Dawkins, and J.Moss"
4,Good performance,"I bought this set as the Ms. Fix-It handy-person in my household,and I'm pleased with it. The bits perform well. The bits are durable & easy to clean. Even the case is sturdy. The price is very reasonable."
3,Great for bigger guys; not little females,"Both my boyfriend and I bought this holster for our vests to carry a Glock 27. He is 6'0, 185 lbs and this fits his vest great! He says his weapon is held tight and secure to his body. I am 5'4; 125 lbs. (much smaller vest) and this holster did not work for me AT ALL. It did not fit on my vest well at all..."
3,Great story - not well written.,"This is a wonderful story of a woman who drags herself from the depths of human existence to become a first class member of society. Kitch's book is depressing at times but has its lighter moments. Unfortunately most of it is written in a ""matter of fact"" way - as a teenager would write - an unwanted pregnancy and the subsequent arrival of the baby is just glossed over as part of the journey. I wanted there to be more reason for the events - I wanted to know more of what was going on in her head. Instead of ""I went back to stealing"" I wanted to know why. However - all in all it's a good story and a fine example of what you can do when you reach an all time low - you can rise from the ashes. Well done Chris - I admire you."
5,Sky Pimps are elevated,"This CD has been in my CD player nearly non stop. Its the kind of album where you hear a rhyme, or rather a phrase, and get a sudden pang of excitement, rewind it and listen to the lyrics again with a smile. Its also a great album to listen to in order to feed frustration or melancholy. Exciting, calming, depressing, or invigorating, whatever you want (unless you really like the radio) is on here."
3,Too expensive,"This was way too expensive here. I would have been better off buying this at Wal*Mart. As for the bulb itself, it turns on, it turns off, and best of all, it can dim with a smooth dimming curve, something CFLs and LEDs simply can not do."
5,Im A Good Kid I Want It Mommy And Daddy,I want the Disney Mix Max because I want an MP3 player and this ones a bute one with the mickey mouse head button. It's light blue my favorite color so I like it. I just want the HSM moive clip even though it costs a lot.I first found it on the Hannah Montana booklet inside the CD case. I told my mom I wanted one and I went online to amazon.com then i searched for it. I just wonder if they are gonna make a Hannah Montana clip or a Hannah Montana Mix Max.
1,Wrong Color,"I specifically ordered the blue one and paid a higher price for it, but instead I was sent the chrome one which is a whole lot cheaper in the stores. If this is what I wanted then I could have purchased it locally. I have requested a refund."
5,Currently the best biography,"Carefully researched and beautifully written biography of Baha'u'llah, the Founder of the Baha'i Faith. This book also includes many photos and illustrations. Covers His entire life, from childhood in Iran to His last days in prison in the Holy Land. I am not aware of any other book in English that has this much detail. Describes how the Shah of Iran and the Sultan of Turkey tried and failed to destroy the Baha'i Faith and its Founder. Also includes a detailed account of His letters to the Kings and Rulers of his time: Napolean, Emperor Franz Josef, etc."
3,It Works!!,"It works for my Utility Vehicle replacement wheel bearing application. Doesn't appear to be SKF brand unless they stopped marking them and use black rubber seals instead of blue. I must say, they arrived very fast. (2 days 1st Class Mail)"
3,"limited, but easy to use","I am still looking for a really good complete carb counter for home cooking. Because I would use it mostly at home, I am not so concerned with the size, but more with the ease of use (meaning that I can find the info I want quickly) and having a large variety of the basic forms of foods listed.So far I find the The Protein Power Lifeplan Gram Counter to be the easiest book of its kind to use.Also, there are even not-so-common varieties of fruits, vegetables, and nuts listed. In my ideal book I would like more, especially in more forms and quantities, though this is good here for a small book.One good aspect is that in addition to carb counts the Eads book lists Omega 6 & 3 values, and has special, easily found, pages on particularly desirable foods (such as high vitamin C, magnesium, E, and biggest bang for the buck foods). I appreciate those extras when planning meals ahead, including deciding what to buy at the grocery store."
4,GOOD LITTLE REFERENCE,"EASY TO READ, SMALL SIZE, ACCESSIBLE FOR ON THE SPOT CHECKS OF WHAT YOU ARE PLANNING TO EAT.."
1,Just don't,Somethings hard to find. Need more prepared food in there. Besides the diet really screwed up my body. Try Weight Watchers and exercise instead.
5,Great movie with superb actors,"I loved this movie starring S. Epatha Merkerson, Terrence Howard, Lou Gosset, Mos Def, Macy Gray, Jimmy Smits, and Marcus Carl Franklin and others. The acting was superb. Terrence Howard and S. Epatha Merkerson made their roles very believable. Growing up in the Black neighborhoods, there was always a grandmotherly type whom everyone trusted, and could go to whenever they had a need. They would always look out for others in the neighborhood who were down and out.I can watch this movie over and over."
4,Excellent ensemble cast,"Lackawanna Blues is a heartwarming film based on Ruben Santiago Jr.'s autobiographical play. The movie tells the story of a young boy (played by Marcus Carl Franklin) growing up in a rooming house run by Nanny Crosby (played by S. Epatha Merkerson). The acting in the film is wonderful! Marcus Carl Franklin does an excellent job of playing young Ruben Santiago Jr., and S. Epatha Merkerson truly embodies Nanny Crosby, the rooming house owner with a heart of gold, who takes in various people from the margins of society to live in her house, giving them a second chance at life and creating a community. I enjoyed seeing Thomas Jefferson Byrd (Clockers, Ray) and Michael K. Williams (Omar from The Wire) playing supporting roles."
5,great movie,I enjoyed this movie very much. The music and musical performances were fabulous and the actors did a great job of portraying their roles. very well done.
4,Wonderful movie,"This turned out to be the perfect movie for late night Christmas Eve while wrapping gifts, sipping egg nog and generally being busy. The actors are excellent and brought their individual talents to the production."
5,Just love it,First of all I love S. Epatha Merkerson and she was the perfect person to play MAMA. I love movies about my Grandmothers era. They had hard times but they knew how to enjoy the good times. I have told all my friends they have to see this movie
5,lakawanna Blues,I loved this movie. Others that have seen the movie say the Woman reminds them of me. This is a Great Honor for me.
5,Lackawanna Blues,"I was very pleased with my purchase, as I have been before. I have never been disappointed with any thing I have purchase from Amazon. They are alway prompt in delivery and very good communication."
5,Award winning movie!,"If it didn't win any awards it should have. If you're a product of the 50s and 60s, you'll see some of everyone you knew here. It really took me back to a good feeling. The movie has many layers that are peeled back like an onion, it will make you laugh and cry. I shared it with my mother and son they both enjoyed it."
3,Racey,"I saw this movie years ago when i lived a different kind of life so some of the scenes didn't bother me then. However, when I decided to buy it & I watched it, it was a bit rougher than I thought! The story line is good and I do not dislike the movies, it was true to it's time. It's just a bit too much for me..I'm selling the DVD"
2,lesson learned,"i really should have known better. i literally just finished an exceptional romance/spy series by another author and just before i clicked the ""buy now"" button, i thought that i really should wait a month or two before reading a similar genre by a different author. unfortunately, i did not listen to myself and as expected, i cannot get into this book at all. compared to the series i just finished, i found this book to be painfully slow, the premise and motivations of the characters rather juvenile and far-fetched, the mystery not so mysterious, etc. it's my fault really. i will revisit Winter Garden when i've properly distanced myself from the romance/spy genre. unfortunately, from what i've read so far, i may not ever find enough motivation to do so."
3,A LOVE STORY,"If you're looking for adventure and intrigue, look somewhere else. This is definitely a love story. Strong characterization and explicit sexual encounters keep your attention. You might want to keep the kleenex on hand. I like more adventure and action with my books, but I read this one quickly and enjoyed it for what it is - a love story."
5,"SPECTACULARLY EXPRESSIVE, IMMENSELY SENSITIVE LOVE STORY","THIS BOOK EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN UNUSUAL CAPACITY FOR COMPLEX FEELINGS. THE DESCRIPTION IS LUSH AND DEEPLY FELT, THE CHARACTERS STRONGLY DRAWN AND BEAUTIFULLY DETAILED. IT IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE TO SEE THE WORLD AS ADELE ASHWORTH HAS IMAGINED IT. ONE OF THE VERY BEST OF IT'S GENRE--ALMOST TRANSCENDING IT."
1,Disappointed in Winter Garden,"I could find nothing to like about the heroine of this book. It might have meant more to me if I had known Thomas' reasons for loving her a bit sooner in the story. But maybe not. I felt sorry that he could not find someone more worthy of him. I might have liked Maddie better if she had been shown to be a bit more compassionate. I saw her as totally self-centered, and self-serving. ""My Darling Caroline"" was one of the best historicals I have ever read, so my dissapointment here was doubled because of that."
1,Winter Garden,"This is the first review I have written for Amazon, although I have been with them for many years. But I feel driven to say that this book is trashy. I was expecting a lovely romance (it has a nice title and I guess I was naive.) But there is little or no plot to this book, and it seems to be simply a vehicle for inserting torrid sex scenes, one after another. I have read less erotic stories in Penthouse and Playboy. No doubt there are readers who want that kind of writing, and I don't object to their having it, but I think it is wrong to lable this book a romance novel; it is simply pornography, and should be labeled as such. I have read my share of both and know the difference. I shall avoid this author in the future."
5,A Must Read,"It doesn't matter if you are a student of history, a space nut, or just looking for a good story, ""Two Sides Of The Moon"" has something for everyone. While I confess there are areas I wished contained more detail about some of the missions (Apollo 15), it is still in my opinion one of the finest Cold War/Space Race books ever written. A compelling story about a turbulent time in American and USSR history by the men who made it."
4,"Compelling, if somewhat flawed","Sampson's review is perhaps a bit too harsh, but it is rather accurate with regard to the glaring factual slips that should have been caught by the most elementary proofreading and fact-checking, the most glaring of which is multiple references in the ""Scott"" scenes of the first chapter, to a ""deHavilland Jenny"" biplane: the JN-4 ""Jenny"" biplane was a Curtiss aircraft. Yet minor factual slips of this type are hardly rare in astronaut biographies and memoirs; indeed, they're quite common, and those here are no worse than those in any number of similar books.I found the repeated references to Scott being barefoot by choice for much of his youth, while Leonov was barefoot by poverty for much of his, to be rather tiresome.But for all its flaws, it is proving (in part, because of its constant juxtaposition of Scott's and Leonov's life events, to be a fascinating and compelling book, which I am looking forward to finishing within the next few days."
1,Leonov the word artist,"James Oberg has done a thorough job...Google 'Random Notes on Leonov's Side of the Moon - for discussion.' It's not only the stuff Leonov says but what he leaves out. Look in the book's index ('Look Inside' feature) for Boris Volynov, one of the era's most ablest cosmonauts, survivor of two extraordinary missions and Leonov and Gagarin's fellow trainee for many years...Why not read 'Red Star in Orbit' and 'Uncovering Soviet Disasters', both by Oberg, although some years old but more revealing of the USSR's 'mindset'. A biography of Volynov is soon to be published."
2,Not what I expected,"The delivery of this item was quick, however I found the advertisement misleading. I thought the watch was a lot smaller amd it looked cheap and tacky when it arrived. As a result I have given it to my friends daughter (who is 6!)."
3,A little heavy but a bulletproof little stove,Best part is the stable platform created with the interlocking pieces. That almost makes up for the extra weight you have to carry. Heavy enough to knock around without worrying about damaging. Puts out plenty of heat and the adjustable vent and screw on top add to ease of use.
3,Great Stove!,"One major problem, there is no where to buy the ""O"" ring washer when it needs to be replaced. This makes storing the fuel in the stove impossible!!!"
4,Handy little asset,"My father and I haven't looked very far into alcohol stoves until just recently, doing some research, the majority of people favored this one, so we pulled the trigger on it. Glad we did because this is a very lightweight way to cook food and 1 oz of fuel burns far longer than what you'd need to boil a few cups of water. Pair it with some HEET and you have a lightweight cooking system. I recommend."
5,Pleased With My Triagia Stove,Very pleased with my stove and wind screen. Lightweight and able to do everything I need in a backpacking stove.
3,Nice but could be improved.,"This stand does what it should, which is to hold the Trangia burner and the pot. The changes I made to it were to cut the notches where the burner goes by 5/8 of an inch, which put the bottom of the pot at a hotter spot in the flame, and to drill it with a bunch of holes for lightness. It now boils 2 cups of water just under 2 minutes faster than the original configuration. There is still enough room below the burner for a pan to preheat in cold temperatures, I use an aluminum drink coaster. I also believe the stand acts as a bit of a heat sink, the holes help with that also. But I am pleased with it and love the Trangia burner."
1,Poor Quality Control,"Doesn't look like Liberty Mountain has any quality control on this. 2 of the three aluminum panels were cut correctly, and one was way off. So far off, that you can't use the holes to clip them all together for easy storage. Come on, it's not that hard? Stack them up and see if they are all the same, for heaven's sake. This should have never left the store."
4,Not Up to Golden Books Version,"Bigger is not always better. And that is what we have here.The artwork in this book is bland and unattractive. All the pages are taken up with close-ups of the characters. It takes away from the overall effect that very colorful and attractive Golden Books version had achieved. Their version of Disney's Jungle Book movie was rich with detailed illustrations. This book is not!The story is all here: of Mowgli, the man-cub, befriended by the animals of the Jungle in India. Bagheera the wise panther, Baloo the bumbling bear, and all his other jungle friends are also all here as they make their way to the man-village. Mowgli saves the day by fending off the cunning tiger, Shere Khan. Don't worry, Shere Khan lives to prowl another day."
2,Just OK,I think that this book is too condensed. I am trying to get my daughter familiar with the jungle book for the DVD release in October and this book was a start but it leaves a lot to be desired.
5,Fast and good condition,The book came really fast and in perfect condition. Our nursery is going to be Jungle Book Themed so I am very happy we received this!
5,Nice!,"Very, very good casual watch. The look is great. A definite buy. Can't go wrong with the price. Great value"
4,Blue Bulova,"I got my boyfriend an invicta pro diving watch for Christmas, but it was so bulky. Amazon let me return it in exchange for this watch and its great. My boyfriend loves it and wears it often. We are very happy :)"
5,:),"My Husband LOVED this. I bought him a Bulova watch 15 years ago, and its been used heavily, so this was a nice upgrade. The blue is beautiful shade. The links were easily adjusted. Great Watch for Bulova fans on a budget."
2,Stopped Working,"This watch stopped working after two months. I would not recommend this watch, it is functional but feels inexpensive, light weight and cheap."
5,"Great looking, quality watch","I am somewhat new to watches, but this Bulova watch is an excellent product. It's a good weight on the hand, and the pictures here on Amazon do not do the look much justice. The blue is very subdued, yet different enough from many watches to provide a nice distinct look. Really enjoy the way this looks."
4,Blue In The Face,"I personally have loved the quality that Bulova has made in their watches, and this one is no exception. There are very few companies that really do make high-quality watches with blue faces, and honestly many people don't always prefer blue-faced watches. This one carries well though. It is a high-quality watch and really has a strong quartz movement, with a easy to read time and date window. It also fits very comfortably around the wrist with little hastles. I do wish though the face could've been a bit bigger though, to see the time better. But nevertheless, it holds up very well. If you are looking for asimple silver-tone watch from Bulova, I suggest you give this one a shot. It really is worth the money.Price: BComfort & Setup: B+Overall: B 1/2+"
1,Book outdated,"This book was originally published in 1979, and contains much outdated material, particularily in the area of diet for your African Gray parrot. You would be well advised to purchase a more up-to-date book if your parrots health is important to you"
1,"Keep looking, because your Grey depends on you !","This book was originally published in 1979, and contains much outdated material, particularily in the area of diet. This book could have had focused more on ilnesses of the African Grey parrot. It is outdated, but it contains extensive information on Grey basics. You would be well advised to purchase a more up-to-date book and I would suggest ""African Gray Parrots"" by Annette Wolter, because your Grey depends on you !"
1,Don't buy it,"This book stinks. It has poor and outdated information. It's like an outdated cliff notes for Grey's. There are many better books out there, save your money!"
2,She's done MUCH better,"Shannon has an amazing voice, but this album absolutely pales in comparison to her first (and much harder to find) album ""Three Wishes."" Now ""Three Wishes"" is an album that I would give 5 stars. It's fairly mellow, but has much, much more substance to it than Moviegoer. If you're new to Shannon, definitely check out ""Three Wishes"" before even touching this one. Also checkout her effort with longtime friend Kristin Asbury under the band name September 67 (the only made one album before they disbanded). That is another 5 star album and much more upbeat and electric than ""Three Wishes."""
5,great product,"ditto all the other reviews (except for the smell review- mine didn't smell). I just wanted to add the the 2 shelves were just what I needed having to switch between my co. letterhead and blank copy paper often. With limited desk space, this solidly built product saved almost 2 square feet of space being able to put two types of paper nicely under my printer."
5,Looks nice and improves my posture at my workspace,"This has been extremely helpful for my posture at my desk. I actually use it as a computer screen table, so I am able to use the correct posture and look up to my screen rather than downwards.It is well made and is actually very attractive on my desk. The compartments are convenient for organizing my work papers.I bought 2 of these for my double screens and my neck has not been as stiff since."
3,Great product - received damaged,"My Rolodex 82431 Printer Stand arrived on time but unfortunately was damaged on the corner from an apparent drop during shipping. The factory box was in pieces and it and the stand were in a brown over pack box when it arrived. I'm not sure if the supplier damaged the stand or shipping company. I decided to keep it and not return it since I was desperate to have it at my office (we moved offices and I needed it immediately). I would cautiously order again from this supplier due to shipping problems although the product was exactly as I ordered. By the way, the cubby holes are perfect size for legal and letter-head paper and holds a full ream of paper in each slot."
4,"works, sometimes a little too sensitive.","I put this on my windows and sliding glass door. It definitely works, albeit a little too well. If the blinds lightly tap it or the window, it goes off. If I gently open and close the sliding glass door, it goes off. So basically, whenever I'm cleaning, having a party or want to use my windows or glass doors I have to turn them off. I'm thinking of replacing them with the Mace security system so I can turn the whole system on at night and off in the morning and not have a monthly fee and have to trust some company like ADT where unscrupulous employees with the master code can break into your house."
4,"audiovox, nice","just to let u know, im not a kid, but i couldnt remember wut the hell my password was. but heres my review: PROS-nice freatures, good range, charger, earbud mics, the LED light is really bright-i was pretty suprised.CONS-scan fuction is really slow, the LED light on 1 of the radios only worked once, wouldnt work again.I got about 5 miles going through thick brush, trees and going over the biggest hills u can imagine. i recommend theses radios.im going to exchange the radios i have for some that have the WORKING LED light."
2,SOUNDTRACK VERY DISAPPOINTING,"THIS WAS LISTED AS A 1979 VERSION, BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A 1993 VERSION, WHERE PART OF THE SOUNDTRACK HAS BEEN REPLACED, DUE TO SOME KIND OF PAYMENT DISPUTE WITH THE SINGER."
4,"Abstract of Early Kentucky Wills and Inventories, Copied from Original and Recorded Wills and Inventories","When I ordered this, I wondered if it would be another book on Jefferson Co., Ky.To my great surprise it wasn't. This book has a lot of information for anyone doing early research in Kentucky."
5,FAVORITE,"This was one of my favorites as an early teen. I read the book until it fell apart and now, in my late 60s, decided to read it again. I thought it would probably be disappointing because of my age and life experience, but it's just as much fun now as it was in the late 50s."
2,Thin,"First of all, the picture shows the mat covering the area behind the second seat, but it only covers the area behind the third seat. This product was a good fit of the area, but it is very thin, and not as heavy duty as I expected, particularly from a company named ""Husky"". I returned it immediately."
1,Complete SCAM.,"I am returning this 28-page totally useless pamphlet. Also, Iwrote a review 2 weeks ago exposing the truth, and it never appearedon the review list. What's going on?Ray Thackeray"
1,Less than worthless,"It's pretty clear that the glowing reviews have been written by author himself -- note the odd spellings and grammar, which are also featured in his ""book."" This pamphlet is grossly overpriced and provides no real insight into the Series 7 or Series 63 exam. If you need to supplement the reading your firm gives you, try ""The Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Money and Markets"" or ""The Vest-Pocket Guide to Stock Brokerage Math."" The ""Bullish Approach""? I returned it -- and managed to pass the Series 7 and 63 anyway. Don't waste your time or money on this."
1,There is no book!,"This is a pamphlet where the author keeps telling you he wishes he had this book when he was preparing for the exam. That's all he says, over and over again. But there is no book. My suggestion - make a really big sign that says: Rule No. 1 - YOU CAN DO THIS. Rule No. 2 - See Rule No. 1 Hang this over your work area and refer to it often. Good Luck!"
1,A Bullish Approach? I don't think so...,"Nothing bullish about the approach Mr. Perry offers in this ""book"". It's more like a 28 page pamphlet with an elementary approach to say the least. This ""book"" is not the most powerful aide of all and should be overlooked due to the ridiculous high price and lousy content."
2,Nothing more then a pep talk...,"Although I'm sure the author had good intentions, this {manual} is nothing more then a good pep talk. If you are looking for material to help you pass the exam, look elsewhere. If you are looking for someone to tell you that you are going to pass, then buy this book."
1,If you need a boost this is it,"this book is just to pump you up. In my opionion it is not worth $30 just to get pumped. I would have gotten more pumped if I could have gotten a actual study technique. Don't waste your money if you are looking for this book to do trick, unless you are relly depressed."
1,Horrible,"I guess the reviews with 1 star bought the book and the reviews with 4 stars are the writer's friends. I happen to have bought it and returned it the next day. ""jog in place while studying so you stay awake"" ???? That's one thing this book tries to teach you. Please save your money and buy a real study book for these exams."
1,Are you kidding me!,This book is a waste of paper and ink. A take-out menu is more informative about the test than this book. - Good Luck!
1,NO WAY!!!!!!,"I have been studying for this test for the last month. When i saw this book i thought it would be a great tool. Well when it came in the mail i was excited and opened the box in great anticipation. HELLO!!! this book is 38 pages, 9 of which are some blank notes pages and the author telling you to meditate. I have returned this in duscuss. I read it in 1/2 hour. The books second half is only read if you failed the test. I read it anyway. NO secrets here! Rip off in the highest form!!! Please do not spend your money on this."
1,"The Series 7 & 63 Secrets of Preparation, A Bullish Approach","Why bother? After reading the reviews of this book by other readers I was excited about receiving this book to help with my Series 7 preparation. However, I was very disappointed. Not only were there several blatant grammatical errors and typos throughout the text, the suggestions for successful preparation of the Series 7 were ridiculous - including drinking 8 8 oz. glasses of water per day and smiling.Don't waste your valuable money or time."
1,A not so bullish approach,This book is an overpriced guide that states that you should have a positive attitude and drink a lot of water to be ready for the test. Of the 33 pages 29-33 are blank note pages. There was nothing in this book that couldn't be explained in a one page document. I'm dissapointed and will return it.
1,Don't Bother,"This book is an utter waste of money. It's NOT a waste of time since it only has about 20 pages of actual text, which is redundant, poorly written and contains grammatical errors.The contents can truly be summed up in three sentences: 1. Study hard 2. Keep a positive attitude 3. Drink plenty of water (no, I'm not kidding)"
4,Beatitudes in Mathew's Gospels,I give this book four stars for its research and details...it is very thorough. It is a challenging read for those of us that are not in the schools of divinity. I sincerely appreciate the author's skill and knowledge. Not recommended for the uninitiated in biblical studies.
2,case,"This is a pretty complete set of taps and dies, metric, sae, regular and fine thread, and very well made. I had a seperate metric and sae set, which each piece snapped into place in the case. This case needs gravity to hold the pieces in place, aided by a chunk of foam over the top of the whole deal, which I'm certain will be lost one windy day.Very good taps and dies, very crappy case."
1,Le Diable au Corps dubbed version,I am still looking for a DVD or even video of the original French version of this wonderful film that I first saw in 1947(when I was 18) at the Continental cinema in London. I do have a video of it but to my disappointment it is a copy and dubbed in English with American accents. It did not completely ruin the film for me but I find myself anxious to see the original before my time is up (I did say I saw it in 1947 ... )
2,devil in the flesh,"This early film of Gerard Philipe is hard to come by, therefor I ordered the English spoken copy. Copy and a bad one at that. Unlike dubbed films from Germany where they try to get actors with a similar voice as the real one, the English doesn't work for me. It should be mentioned that this is a copy, not an original, and the price ought to be accordingly."
1,Devil of a Devil,"This is one of my favorite movies. That beautiful man, Gerard Philipe, is a pleasure to watch. But this ""copy""is dreadful, almost unwatchable. I should have sent it back but it still wove a spell. Only watched it once. Want to buy it?"
2,A Falsified Original,LE DIABLE AU CORPS ('Devil in the flesh') (1946) was not directed by Jacques Tati but by Claude Autant-Lara. The version you delivered is not the French 'version original' but a version with American voices-over. Two crucial scenes are omitted (slaughtered by the censor?)
2,"Great film, Bad transfer to DVD","Fine old film. Trend setting in a way, but ill served by this poor transfer to digital media. Perhaps better original material was not available, but whatever reason, beware: this one sucks."
1,"Not as Advertised, I received an Eau De Toilette","Don't get me wrong, the perfume smells wonderful! It's by far my favorite, BUT this is advertised as an Eau De Parfum when it's actually an Eau De Toilette. The advertising is false. When I purchased this particular perfume from the same seller, it even had Eau De Parfum in the title, which they have since taken off. I still love the scent, but it's a rip for a very watered down perfume. I compared it to my mother's that she bought in Neiman's and there is a noticeable difference in strength of smell. Just a warning for future buyers because you won't be able to ship it back for a refund. :)"
2,Over-hyped,"It is very unusual that I don't enjoy a recommended book from Amazon.com, however I had difficulty finishing this one. I found myself reading ahead just to get through it. The characters were well developed, but I could just not get interested in them. The story was bland and ultimately unsatisfying."
2,Our ferrets weren't impressed,"I bought this a couple months ago for our two ferrets and after initially checking it out, they have only gone in it a few times. They prefer their hammock and the Marshall Ferret Ark that we got them for Christmas. I have to admit that I'm surprised they don't care for it because they love the flexible plastic tunnels that we have for them to play with out of the cage. This one just doesn't seem to do much for them."
4,Pretty nice for pet rats!,Worked great! My rats love these. Great unless one of your pets is a chewer. Overall a great deal and priced less than most stores! :-)
2,Save your money if you are buying for rats,"This seemed like a great idea but it lasted less than 8 hours in the cage with our two rats. They promptly chewed it up, ripped off the metal clasps, and used them as a part of their bedding. This might be better suited to ferrets, guinea pigs and such but not for rats."
3,Color NOT the same as pictured,"I rated this as OK, due to the fact there was nothing in the description saying I would not be getting the item pictured. I wanted the striped one and instead I got an ugly brown one. If there is a chance you will not get the item shown it needs to state that."
2,My rats dont even use it.,This came in a totally different color what advertised and the fabric was thin and cheap. I have fleece lining the inside to make it a little more comfy and yet my rats dont even use it!
5,Rats LOVE this tunnel,"My two female rats are on their second play tunnel. They like to chew on it, so don't expect it to last too long, but my girls sleep in the tunnel, eat in the tunnel, and use it as a bathroom (to my disgust). They hate the fuzzy one I got them for winter, so I guess they'll just keep this one."
2,flimsy cozy,"not only did the pieces in the assortment not match, but they are poorly made. i will make my own before i waste the money again"
5,Great Tunnel,I bought this product for my hairless rat. He loves it I put a towel or washcloth in it for him and he loves to sleep in it all day and hang out in it. I bought another and wash them and switch them out. Great product for your rat if they want an area to sleep.
5,Rat gymnastics,"The rats really enjoyed tunnelling through the air in this! They sleep in it, eat in it and are often found using it. Thanks."
2,smaller than looks and no color puke green :(,"Small tunnel nothing like photo and no color in it, it's like an army puke green yuck will keep because it is what it is."
4,"good for low to moderate compression, terrible at high compression","Good:-dual band compression-solid construction-easy to use-dual output-great valueBad:-farts out completely (massive, nonmusical distortion) if you go too loud or past about 10-11 o-clock on the compression. I'd rather have finer control over the usable part of the band. Really I'd rather it did better at high compression, but at this price, what can you expect?The dual band feature allows me to compress the bottom end on my bass so that I can play in a variety of styles without having to change volume settings, without having to bring in a bunch of string noise by compressing the high end. That's why I got it, and it does that just fine as long as you don't push the compression too hard. A quality noise gate and higher quality compressor might be a better solution, but it ought to be considering that's about 500 bucks worth of gear, and this is less than $100.I can't speak to the battery life, I always use a power supply."
1,Vice Grip no longer means quality,I had to send this item back because the jaws not only did not meet they were angled. Horrible quality when you expect Vice Grip as a quality item. It no longer is when they send out junk like this.
4,Superb,I really think this documentary is a great eye opener for our young kids.For one it will frighten them from the criminal aspect of life.In seeing those young guys go to the pen for 15 to life should awake some of our young generation.Anyway I think the actors did a great job on this low budget documentary.Specially that Satan guy.If you haven't seen this movie you need to pick it up.Much luv Gumbo
2,15 to Life Review,"I got this film expecting it to be a serious documentary regarding the topic. Unfortunately, when I started watching it, within the first 5 minutes I realized it was fake. The nonbelieveable acting gave it away. I think if the creator of this film was trying to strike a blow for ""the cause"" of African Americans, I think they missed the mark. The film perpetuates a huge amount untrue stereotypes, and I'm shocked so many African American actors and actresses agreed to work on this film. If you want to find a real documentary about this topic please do, but please find a different one. I got taken."
2,i was disaapointed.,i wanted the movie not the documentary. i wish that i had review my selection a little more careful. i will in the near furture.
1,The Day That Panicked America,"VERY DISSAPPOINTED!! I was looking for the movie with the same name, not the documentary on Orson Welles or highlights of what occurred from an announcer, BUT THE MOVIE!! The movie was an excellent movie and had a very strong impact on me.Anyone know where I can get THE MOVIE VERSION? Email me at: italiangwmjcnj@yahoo.com THANKYOU"
2,Not what I was expecting,"This DVD was not the item I had been looking for, an old made for tv movie of the making of the radio broadcast. It is an ok documentry of the cause behind the panic. The vidio is not very good nor is the soun quality. The good thing about the package is the cd of the broadcast."
1,NOT Leonard Nimoy,This dvd lists Leonard Nimoy on the credits but in fact he does not appear at all.Fans have been badly misled by this error.
3,I was disappointed but mildly entertained.,"I thought I was getting the movie with the late Vic Morrow but it was entertaining and I learned from my Dad that our cousins in Princton, NJ had taken shelter in their old root cellar.I'll be glad when the real movie is available."
