3,ita ok,It hold the cd just fine but even strapped in it hangs low. I'm a short girl and I still bump my head on it while I drive.
3,It's ok.,"Not bad for the price, but you get what you paid for. CDs are CONSTANTLY falling out of it in turns. Good thing I had my window up otherwise I would have lost about 5 CDs out the window."
4,Case Logic 20 CD,"Looks good, holds CDs well, has a pen holder which comes in handy at times. Only complaint is, after installing this, I can't completely close the visor (C300)."
3,healing a broken heart,Book is ok. It has you writing to much information. Not very helpful in that respect. Would not recommend book at this time.
1,Low rating because the format is not good for an e-reader,"I probably would have a different review if i had purchased a paper copy of this book, because it came highly recommended to me. The format for the e-reader is extremely small images of questions and includes the fill in lines for the answers. This was not a well thought out format for electronic books. I was unable to read the book on my screen, and I am certainly not able to sit down and write out my answers to those questions on my e-reader. Poorly formatted, I do not recommend this item. If you want it, try the paper copy."
2,mediocre,"not much in the way of car talk as you might expect in such a book..Rather disjointed, not worth a read..."
1,the keystone cops is more like it!!!!!!!,"this is not a t.v. movie but a little seen release from the late 80's and it is an ""r"" rated movie so it isn't kid friendly,or really adult friendly! even a t.v. movie would be better than this turkey! the plot has as many holes as a golf course and lee majors,abe vigoda,and don rickles look tired and don't seem to be very happy to be in this ""film"". so if you want to see what lee majors did after the six million dollar man here's your chance."
5,Sturdy and useful,"This item is very Sturdy and useful for many purposes, especially for carrying digital cameras."
1,stopped working within 1 month,"This is a really cheap mouse. While using it, the cursor would freeze up like every five minutes. Within one month, the mouse stopped functioning all together. So there went my money.Also, this ""optical"" mouse REQUIRES the use of their special mousepad to track correctly. Optical mice are supposed to work on all non-reflective surfaces."
2,Not a bad book but there are better ones.,"The book suffers from a few minor errors and focuses a bit more on a dumbell workout (partly as a plug for Dr. Vedral's bench and dumbell set, I assume). Dr. Vedral's books suffer from a common problem of underestimating the time required to complete an exercise routine. I suggest that the reader instead consider ""Weight Training for Dummies"" which I've found to be comprehensive and well written."
5,great promise that delivers,"I am a 29 year old martial artist who took sabbatical and had to rebuild what I had lost. This book helped much more than Schlossberg's DUMMIES guide or the Schwarzenegger books....plus, unlike most fitness books, this author actually cares to follow up on emails and such. Sure, she is selling dumbells in the back, but that doesnt mean her information is any less valuable. This is her career. Stick with the plan and see the results."
5,Tennis strokes that win...,"is just awesome! I went from being a 1.0-1.5 player to being a 4.0 just using Frank's book. Before I could hardly hit solid groundstrokes and now I'm doing it with ease. Great job, Frank!"
3,A tennis player beginner read this book,"I bought this book and it gave me a good help to improve my shots, specially my serve. I found an in-depth analysis for this shot. It's focused only in shots. I was expecting some chapter about the mental side. Also, nothing about strategy."
5,Review from student of author,"Frank is one of the finest men I have ever known. I think his committment to self actualization is clear in this book. Frank lives his life in the here and now -- when he plays tennis, that's what he thinks about. When he teaches, he is focused on helping the student. In this book, Frank tells you exactly how to visualize your play and how to stay focused on your strengths -- so that you can win the game. I highly recommend it."
5,"Very clear, concise instruction",Really well ordered and well done. Unique instructional concepts. Worth a look if you find yourself in a rut.
5,Review from Optics & Laser Technology,"""...the student that is led into the laser field by this text is lucky. The text is excellent and filled with appropriate illustrations...Overall, this work will also be useful as a reference for the topics covered. The literature references are copious and appropriate. The text is well supplied with figures and graphs and for those areas considered in detail, the book is and will remain a very good reference volume."""
5,A short trip to the Yoknapatawpha County,"Last year, when I was assinged a report on the author William Faulkner, I knew nothing about him. I went to my school's library and checked out over 10 books. Out of the 6 non-fiction books that I checked out on the subject, this was the most complete, informative, and easy-to-understand. If it was not for this book, I doubt that I ever would have completed my Term Paper.I highly recamend this book to anybody looking to learn about the life of one of america's most universal writers during the 1920s up until the early 60s."
5,Corinthians Bible study,"This is a great study of Corinthians. It is well written and in plain language that is easy for everyone to understand. We are using it for a Bible study that meets in our home. The chapter size lends itself well to a 60-90 minute session. These same authors have written books on other books of the Bible, and we plan to use some of those in future studies."
1,Bad Book and worse story,I guess it goes to show that just about anything can be published these days. This book is a structural horror story as the writer apparently has no clue to punctuation and proper grammar. The story itself is infantile and simple-minded.
5,Great Artist,"Found her by accident because I loved Eastmountainsouth. She was touring w/Peter from EMS and since I was checking out his new music, I thought I would check her out too. She has a great sound and style. The music truly speaks to you. I could relate to a lot of the lyrics. This is my favorite of her three albums but they all are worth a chance."
5,Worth the wait.,I have been looking forward to Ms. Peacocks lastest for quite a while & I'm pleased to say I was not the least bit dissapointed.The songs a bit more mello than her previous album but the content nonetheless is quality. You can hear that a lot of hard work went into this album. Favorite song: Baby come back.I just don't understand why Alice Peacock's music is hardly known and not played on the airwaves. Something is deffently wrong!
4,Down By the Sea,"Alice Peacock's ""Who I Am"" is a wonderful new discovery for me. ""Sunflower"" has a lovely melody with a pastoral theme backed byDanny Howe's acoustic guitar that brings to mind the melody for Paul McCartney's ""Mother Nature's Son"" as Alice sings, ""Isn't it amazing? What you see."" ""Baby Come Back"" is another favorite of mine that makes me hit the repeat button, ""I was wrong & I know it; So much pain in your eyes & I've no way of knowing."" ""Runaway Day"" has a sunny melody and a little trill in the chorus that brings to mind the title track from Karen Jacobsen's CDBeing Brave, which I love. In Alice's song, her piano keeps the melody as her vocals exude sunshine, ""Just for the day let's runaway; won't you play with me? Down by the sea, I'll show you how happy we can be."" The other tracks on the CD are very good, some are a bit sad. Overall, this is an excellent discovery! Enjoy!"
1,Sad. The book is distorted by the Japanese.,"First of all this book states that Yayoi is 100% Japanese however it's actaully 50% Korean, 30% Chinese, and 20% Middle Asia's culture. Also this book rarely talks about the killing of 3 million innocent Koreans and 0.8 million Chinese and torturing them by raping, experimenting and killing for entertainment when half of Japan's history was killing and robbing."
3,,"When you hear the first few seconds of Gojira's latest offering, you think you're in for a mechanized experience full of Meshughah-isms and crazy instrumentations. By the time the playing advances, this monster (no pun intended) turns into a deadly machine that combines the same attributes of said band, along with SYL-injected adrenaline, a touch of Morbid Angel in the riff department and some atmospherics moments (well, more like ""spacey moments""). At 12 songs, you can't possibly go wrong here. Gojira's third offering is worthy of your time and money."
4,Wow...,"I didn't knew this guys untill I hear this new album and let me tell you...Gojira is awesome! Great drums, good guitars and vocals are not of this world... Gojira is a nice surprise, very powerfull, a very original sound, really refreshing the image of european Metal."
5,Great slimmer under dresses or pants,"I was looking for shapewear to use under my formal wear for a cruise. I have two of these flexees and ended up using these every night under pants or a dress, hand washing, hang dry, no problem."
3,Great for a small player,"This had all the dvd pouches and storage space needed for a players around 6"" or less. But more than that, everything just wont fit (for me it was my headphones). Even for a small player, the case would still budge. My overall sugestion would to try to find a bigger case, or I heard that you could just try to get a breifcase."
5,Very handy organizer for the glovebox!,"An excellent way to organize registration & insurance paperwork for the car, along with receipts for maintenance and any repairs. Unlike my former booklet, that had a plastic cover over the paperwork, this one has nylon net so that the printing won't transfer. Also areas for a pen, small flashlight & tire gauge. Just the right size to fit in the glovebox without being too thick and at a very affordable price."
3,Handy but not big enough for owners manual...,"I just received this today and I was disappointed to see it was not big enough to hold my Isuzu Rodeo owners manual. It does hold the maintenance book, registration, insurance card and tire pressure gauge. If you need something large enough to hold your manual...keep looking!"
1,Useless,"This organizer is basically a big pocket with two mesh document holders. The big pocket does not hold my car's manual. Could you fit maps in it? Probably but who uses maps in these days of GPS? The pen slots are annoying and difficult to get pens in/out of. The mesh pockets for registration and insurance information at least is useful because it won't cause the ink to stick to a plastic cover. No slots for cards (AAA, for example). Not worth the money."
4,Keeping it Neat.......,Purchased and just received this item. Nice to have all the items that we keep in our glove compartments organized. Makes life a little easier while traveling. Certainly would make a great stocking stuffer for the Holidays too.
5,Worthy purchase,Great little product. Holds all the stuff I had in my glove box which was highly unorganized. Now that's all I have in there is this organizer. Everything else is neatly placed inside of it. Can't beat the price either
2,"Too silent, too simple","As a teenager, I was a big fan of Asia. Since John Wetton left the band, its music became uninteresting.Akustika - Live In America can be considered as a kind of Unplugged Greatest Hits from Wetton and the bands he has been part of.So there he is, on stage, a man with a nice and emotional voice, a guitar and a piano. Everything is nice and clean... but it is kind of boring. These silent versions of rock hymns like Voice Of America do not come near the power and the intense soul of their originals.The exception is Only Time Will Tell out of which John Wetton makes a good Akustika. The album as a whole is something you put on when you invite your new girlfriend up for the first time."
1,piece of crap,"yep, like I said above, you get what you pay for and this was like a giant stuffed animal hammock. I would not even let my kids use it. So disappointed when I opened the box. Get a woven hammock instead."
3,so-so,"My daughter was super excited when this came in the mail, but when we opened it and set it up, she wasn't so excited anymore. She weighs eighty pounds and is five feet tall, so should be no problem for her to get on it and lay. But she had a really hard time even getting on it. When she finally did, she said it wasn't very comfortable, like she felt she would fall through it. I tried it and felt the same way. I'm returning it and getting a wider, more durable/better quality one instead."
3,You get what you pay for,"You definitely get what you pay for when it comes to hammocks apparently. This was a low budget piece that I got because I didn't know how much we would use it. It works well, but don't expect a huge life expectancy if you leave it outside (easily remedied, but I was lazy). The strings at the ends started breaking after a few weeks.This is perfect for lighter people though."
2,Misleading Image,"It's noticeably ""made in China"". The hammock is all white. The picture posted online is cropped to show the background of a yard. The photo is misleading again with the hammock looking larger than it is, but it's true to the dimensions listed. As far as the ""display box"", it was beat up pretty nicely, yet the outer box showed no damage. Construction of the hammock is commensurate with the cost. I'm sure had I spent a little more on a handwoven Mexican hammock, I would be writing a much different review."
5,For me its perfect,"I needed s simple. inexpensive hammock for use in a covered porch. I'm 160 lbs and 5'9"" and athletic. It took me a trip to the hardware store to buy a couple of threaded hooks, a tape measure, and a drill to install it. In 20 minutes I was comfortably swaying on the hammock. There is plenty of room for me to be extremely comfortable. I'm happy!"
5,Chilling,"This book is a exact display of the horrible pain Barbra put her victims and their families through. My uncle was murdered by Barbra Hoffman, she will be put away for life. This book brings to life the chilling reality of why."
2,My dogs figured this out in 5 minutes,"I bought this to keep my two dogs in the back of my Rav 4. Within minutes, they realized they could take their noses and slide the bars in and go around the barrier. I even tried to get the trombone arms flush against the windows/doors. Then, my younger dog realized that there is a gap due to the way the legs tighten and he would squeeze under the barrier (he weighs 70 lbs). So, then I bought the extension, but due to the height of my ceiling, the gap is still large enough for him to squeeze through. So, then I flipped it over and he was able to squeeze between the ceiling and the bar. Now, I am looking for a different product."
3,not impressed,"We bought this for our Subaru legacy wagon because it says it will fit ANY vehicle. Well it doesn't fit, it ended up being too tall at it's lowest setting. Luckily it should fit in our jeep, so it's not a total loss."
1,"bad product, bad experience","product wasn't delivered with all of the required parts for installation. the instructions also start assuming that 3 steps have already been completed, which made it tougher to identify that the issue. bad product."
4,Very pleased,"I recently purchased this item for the purpose of transporting a dog I adopted. I have used other barriers without much success. I drive a Dodge Journey, and decided to view Dodge's website first to see what they recommend. The WeatherTech 60010 is the one they have listed.I absolutely hate putting furniture, etc. together...seems like anything you buy these days has to be assembled. This item was a piece of cake. I thought the directions were straightforward and I had it set up and secured in the back of my car in no time.My dog (80 lb. Rott) tested it, but didn't seem interested in trying to get out, therefore I don't know how the barrier would hold up with a more determined dog...that would be my other dog, and I haven't tried him yet. Also, the barrier is blissfully quiet."
5,"Good quality, sturdy equipment, my 80 lb lab can't budge it.","This is a great product that I found to be a little pricier than some of its competitors that I have read reviews on saying some pieces are not properly fastened so there is a rattling noise you hear. There is no rattle noise on this one, and it's strong rubber ceiling protectors won't damage your truck's interior. There are no hazard objects sticking out for your dog to get caught on. I have this in my Ford Escape. Installation was simple. Worth the price difference in my opinion."
3,Great idea,"Like the other reviewer, the pen I received did not work, but the vendor sent me a replacement right away and paid for return shipping for the defective pen. The new pen works fine. Okay, it was a bit of a hassle just for a ball point pen, but it is so convenient having it in the phone! I love it!"
1,Junk,"The pen didn't write. I received a prompt replacement from the seller, and the pen didn't write. No good."
2,Bad eraser.,"I bought four of these pencils. Of the two I use the most often, the erasers broke off long before they wore out. Once the eraser breaks, the stub cannot be removed with your fingers. You'll have to use a screwdriver or other tool to remove the broken eraser. I recommend the Pentel Twist-Erase over this product."
2,I guess checking for errors was too costly.,"This book is loaded with errors. It is a very basic math book, and it is organized well, but it has so many errors in the text and in the ""answers"" in the back of the book. If your instructor requires this book, beg him/her to pick something else. The workbook is OK, but no answers are provided."
3,"Johnny ""Bulldog"" Tristao is funny...","Good album, it sounds a lot like a ""Creedence Clearwater Revival"" one, but Johnny has a particular voice and its always great to hear him. Good country rock songs."
4,Good book on adventure,"Although I am jealous of Mr. Bushby's travels and adventures because I wasn't with him I do have one little problem with his language. I am no prude nor does bad language bother me, but I will not be recommending this book to ""mother"" because of his slightly overuse of bad language. Other than this ............. WELL WRITTEN AND ONE HECK OF A STORY!!"
2,Actual item is MONO audio -- not as currently pictured,"Hopefully Amazon will correct this error, but as of 12/12/2007 their photo of the product is wrong. This cable only has 2 RCA plugs, one for video and one for audio. The one I wanted was as pictured having 2 for stereo audio, with the necessary 4-conductor mini-plug to attach to a camcorder."
2,Great ?,"I am obliged to disqualify myself from properly reviewing this book.My own direct and personal experience of each of these six regions - except perhaps the theft, insects, pestilence and corruption - is so far, far different from that described by the various selected `celebrities' that are invited to fly in (or perhaps fly-by) by a major TV Corporation at their expense, accompanied by no more than six or seven crew members, guides and minders result in such a politically-correct distortion of those cultures that I was unable to finish even one complete chapter.You may enjoy it, particularly if you have not visited these destinations before, as it is certainly widely dispersed, with trips to Africa, Australia, the Caribe, Asia and Mexico.However; these would not be my choice or recommendation of GREAT journeys."
3,Air Compressor,"I haven's used it yet. I found out the price differance wasn't that great, they have these at Home Depot for around the same price for brand new. This one is refurbished, and so far, one metal arm is missing and a screw is stripped where the other arm should be. I have yet to use the produce and hoping it works great."
4,For Everybody,"My sister received a computer, but had no clue how to use it. I got this book for her, because it explains things clearly without a lot of jargon. I would have preferred that it had a little more information about some aspects of the computer such as email, but this book has a lot to cover. It can't go in depth about everything (and besides that, the publisher puts out other books in this series that explains individual computer subjects). A good starter textbook for those who are totally new to the computer, however."
4,great book,easy to understand which was the purpose of the purchase - book in great condition - enjoy sharing with other senior citizens
5,Great reference,"I've found this book to be an invaluable reference. I much prefer to use natural remedies over pharmaceuticals and this book makes it easy. Includes lots of recipes with thorough instructions for home remedies and great advice for what foods to avoid, etc."
2,Naturally Healthy Childrena nd Babies,"I think the book is ok, no cart wheels for it, but its alright to have as reference, my little itch with the book is layout, makes it a hard read, and i think there is just something about the way the book is presented and other things that just does not float my boat, the content is fine I guess, Its about things that can be done naturally to look after children naturally using herbs etc, but I have better books than this that edify me better regarding natural health and holistic living, so I find myself refering to this seldom, if at all."
4,Good for parents,This is a great book for parents to have. I got it for my sister in law. It is high time that parents stop stuffing their kids full of poisonous vaccines and terrible antibiotics. They wonder why they are sick all the time- not to mention the processed foods. This book will help parents straighten out their path and stop harming their kids.
2,"Boo, Hiss....","Okay the guy has a great voice. But where oh where is Cha Cha Heels featuring the astounding Eartha Kitt?! Yeah, yeah, they are focusing on one guy... still they could've squeezed it in just so one wouldn't have to buy any other album. OK heels start stomping..."
3,Good companion volume,"This is a good book to have if you have already read Your Self-Confident Baby, actually written by Magda Gerber, and are an enthusiast. It's a series of essays and talks given by Gerber and edited by someone else into a semi-coherent guide. It's the first book we read on the subject, and taking the theory of respect into practice has made a giant difference in our interactions with our son, but we were both annoyed by the occasionally hectoring tone. I have just finished the Self-Confident Baby, and found it to be more coherent, more comprehensive, more sympathetic, and all around more useful. I definitely recommend the RIE method to any new parent or grandparent, it's made a world of difference in the level of peace in our household with our (very) active son, but start with the other book."
2,Poorly and Boring written account of what might be true,"I found this a very dry read... I could not finish it. Authors who set out to write a book, should have the intention that it should be read. Sorry, for all the gems it might contain , I just think it is a poor job."
2,Close the Dragon Gate,Great disservices to people whom are searching for information and enlightenment on Taoism. The authors used a map of china and a few books on Taoism to take the reader on an almost 300 page fairy tale coated to read like a biography. The characters shift personality quicker than a chameleon does color. I think there is a story in the book but the contrived situations get in the way.
4,Quite a good tale...,"This book is along the lines of Deng Ming Dao's ""The Wandering Taoist"" series - it tells the tale of how a contemporary Taoist Master learned his art. In this case, it tells the story of Wang Liping's journey from ordinary youth to Master. Along the way the reader is treated to an overview of some of the trials and tribulations people used to undergo _before_ Masters would even consider teaching them the most simple technique.The story mostly concerns the initial training (some very interesting techniques here...) and then subsequent journeys of Liping. As the story approaches its close the Cultural Revolution begins and the tale takes a twist similar to that in ""The Wandering Taoist"" - a complete break from tradition.I have read this a couple of times since it came out and the trials endured by the young Liping never fail to amaze me when compared to the easy access we now enjoy. I suspect anyone who cultivates will enjoy the tale too."
5,Terri's Story,I have followed the Terri Schiavo story for many years and find this book one of the most well written accounts. This is an excellent book and I would recommend it. I am rating this book 5 stars.
4,"Great deal, but heavy and foot clicker is difficult","Hey, it's a great vacuum and I'd buy it again in a second. Terrific price. Really cleans well.On the downside it's heavy. It likes to run forward and you have to put a little muscle into it to get it to come back to you. The worst thing is that clicky thing that you have to step on to release the handle to the down position. It's hard to do -- takes a lot of foot pressure.It would be nice if it had a headlight and some indication when the bag is full, but for the price you can't beat it!"
4,great product could have ued the extras,the vaccum itself is awesome. i was under the assumption that the beater bar handle brush was coming with it. no way to get dog hair off the furniture with out it.
1,WASN'T REFURBISHED,"The vacuum I received wasn't apparently refurbished. Right out of the box, it had problems. The brushes didn't have the strength to vacuum carpeting. The foot peddle fell off with each use. I purchased this same vacuum new last year for my girlfriend and she's loved it. This one's going back. My learning is pay the extra 50 bucks and get something that works."
3,Eureka Boss Upright vacuum,"This vacuum, while given high ratings by consumer reports which influenced my purchase, has not lived up to my expectations. It is quite heavy and noisy. The cord is significantly shorter that my previous panasonic vacuum. And, within a month of purchase, a plastic part on the base broke off and now the has only two positions: completely upright or in the ""ready"" position. I cannot tilt on the rear wheels to go from floor to carpet; I must lift the entire machine onto the carpet. The only saving grace is that it has excellent suction."
2,Don't buy refurbished!,"While this Eureka Boss vacuum cleaner is powerful, sturdy, and self-propelled (although very heavy), I would not recommend buying it refurbished. I thought we were getting a good deal by saving $50 off the retail price, however, the mechanism you push w/ your foot to release and tilt the vacuum cleaner does not working correctly. This was clearly the reason the vacuum cleaner was returned by the first owner, and nothing was done to ""refurbish"" this malfunction before it was shipped out to us. We need to basically hammer the part in order to recline the machine. Also, it was missing hoses and attachments, and I needed to call to request them. So think twice before buying refurbished!"
5,Like New,"As said by others: Arrived packed in original styrofoam, like new, not a scratch, everything works. Minor inconvenience: remember to turn knob to return suction to bottom after using hose."
2,"Bought 2 - 1 Great, 1 Junk","The price was so good we bought 2. One is everything we expected. It worked great right out of the box. The other is a piece of junk. We've had it two months now and have spent 30 hours trying to get it fixed. If we ever get it right ... well, my time lost is more valuable than any savings."
4,Good product,Have owned for a few weeks. Seems to do the job well. Was very well reviewed by a leading consumer publication.
2,incomplete!,"I ordered a refurbished Eureka...it came quickly and as vacuum cleaners go, this was a good product at a good price. But, the extension wand was not included and no ""power paw."" I called the 800# and was told they could not do anything since it was refurbished. When I pressed my point that refurbished is not ""unfurbished"" they agreed to send the extension wand. I had to buy the power paw at $14.99 plus over $8.00 in postage and handling. It's the last time I'll buy refurbished."
5,Great Value and Quality,"This vacuum sucked up all of the dog hair that my Oreck has always left behind! (Besides not having to pick up the hair personally, I also didn't have to stop the vacuum multiple times to clean out the brush) This is definitely a great product at a bargain price. A little heavier than I'm used to - but not unmanageable. Overall - I'm extremely satisfied with the product!!"
3,vacuum,Good at picking up dog hair but very heavy and bulky to use. Plus it is hard to find vacuum bags for it.
3,Mixed emotions,I received the vacuum on time but noticed problems right away. The hose for attachments will not stay in it's storage area and keeps falling off as I vacuum. The brushes do not stop as they are supposed to when it is vacuuming bare floor. And the motor sounds very slightly like it's slowing and speeding up while vacuuming. I didn't contact the seller about these issues because I had bought a house and was moving and involved in all the chaos and stress that entails. Afterward I thought it was probably too late. The good news is it vacuums beautifully. I bought a this Eureka because I loved my son's vacuum and it looks very similar to this one. It vacuums better than any vacuum I've owned.
2,Not 100% Satisfied,"Firstly, I don't want to say this product is all bad. It's a great vacuum cleaner I'm sure for most people. The problems I've had are listed below:1 The belt is way too fragile. This could be an issue with thick carpet and low floor settings, but I really don't think it should only take a minute of running on the wrong floor setting for the belt to snap.2 On delivery, the end of the hose had a crack in it that greatly reduced suction. I didn't notice the crack right away and just assumed it was a problem with the suction of the host itself, but then realized this later. I'm not sure if this is still under warranty but I wonder if I can get a replacement.3 If you have a furry dog that sheds a lot, this is not the vacuum for you. I have an Australian Shepherd / Lab mix, and he sheds often. This vacuum does not deal well with that, make noises, and ultimately just leaves behind larger clumps of hair from the hair it's collected."
5,Great Vacuum,I like this vacuum alot-I recently adopted a Cavalier King Charles spaniel and there is hair everywhere. Only drawback is that the hose for the attachments does not stay locked in place and it is always flopping around. Does a good job on either hardwood floors and carpet. I don't find it to be very heavy to push around and it almost seems just to need my direction.This was great purchase.
5,Best Vacuum I've Ever Used!,"I LOVE this vacuum! It's quieter than my old Dirt Devil and so much more powerful, got up debris that must have been in my carpet a long time, as it pretty much filled a bag after the first 2 times vacuuming. My other vacuum was that bad and this unit is FAB! No more pet hair worries! EZ to use and to switch from floor to hose. Lot's of carpet height selection to chose from too. Nice attachments and storage of them! It's not hard to push, like some others claim....they must have broken arms or extremely weak to say this! I'm a petite woman and have no problem with it! It glides across my carpet and bare floors. You just need to have it on the right height! Arrived Super Fast! I actually enjoy vacuuming with this Eureka. I would definitely Recommend this Vacuum to ALL!"
4,works so far,This vacuum is a steal of a deal so far. I've only used it a couple of times and it performs very well on hard surfaces. (I have no carpet.)
4,Great Vacuum - the second time...,"The first rebuilt unit worked fine but was missing some of the parts that hold the accessories in place. Amazon promptly issued a Call Tag for UPS to pick up this unit. There was some confusion over the restocking time before the replacement would be shipped. Initially they said it might be 6 weeks but the replacement arrived within a few days.This reconditioned unit was complete and in good physical condition. I personally think it is relatively quiet for the amount of suction this provides. The overall weight is the only negative we can think of and that really isn't that big of a concern. However, the features, performance and value make this purchase a $69 no-brainer."
2,works great...until it stops working,"the reviews are true--it's louder and heavier than my previous, more expensive hoover, but it got the job done. however, 8 months and about 20 vacuumings later, only the suction from the hose works! the refurbished warranty has lapsed, and forgive me for not wanting to clean a 2500 sq. ft. house with a hose from a heavy vacuum! i thought i was getting a great deal with the refurbished price...but $12/month for a vacuum that's now worthless isn't that great of a deal after all!"
1,Be Very Careful with this Rebuilt Product,I received vacuum within 1 day of ordering. Good. I used it for about 20 minutes when I switched from Floor to Hose suction...motor stopped immediately and never restarted. I waited 1/2 hour and tried again.. lights come on but motor appears to be seized and shuts off right away after dimming lights in house. I took machine to Eureka authorized service center noted on their website.....they refused to honor warrantee and service the product and advised returning it to Amazon.
1,reconditioned by whom?,"This vacuum was highly rated by Consumer Reports and at $99.00( reconditioned )seemed a good buy. It arrived by U.S. Mail very poorly packed with chunks of styrofoam all over the inside of the box. Upon assembling I noticed it was missing the attachment tubes and when turned on the brushroll didn't work. In addition, the finish was marred and smudged. I sent it back and ordered a Hoover Windtunnel 2. It works well and appears to be of higher quality."
1,The roller brush stopped,"I've had this vac only three months and suddenly, the roller brush stopped working and the motor heated up. I shut it off, removed the plate, and found that the belt was loose and melted in places. I would not recommend a refurbished Boss Upright . . . it had great suction for the few times I used it, but I'm looking at a major repair now, much more than a belt."
1,Verry bad shape.,"I received a battered, well used vacuum that upon being plugged in immediately made a loud wining noise, smelled like burnt rubber and would not pick up much of anything off the floor."
5,Great Vacuum for dog hair,"I love this vacuum. I recently replaced all the carpeting in my house and my old vacuum didn't pick up the dog hair well enough. I read the reviews on this model which many people specifically mentioned dog hair. Got it, and it works GREAT!! would buy it again in a munite. The cheaper refurb price is nice too."
2,"Worked great at first, then belt kept breaking","I buy a vacuum every 8 years, so I need something that is very powerful and will never break down. This one is quieter than all the others I've had. All the functions work. It was easy to assemble and insert the bag. It's still a little tricky pressing down on the pedal to release the handle, but I'm getting the hang of it. I would buy another one in 8 years if they still sell them. It seems to me that this technology is perfect for my house - mostly hardwood floors with some mats, carpets, and one wall-to-wall carpet. The vacuum does a great job on all of them.UPDATE: December 2010 - After about a year, the vacuum ceased to pick things up and it demanded a new belt every three months. After over a year of arguing with the vacuum over whether it would turn the brush or not and spending a lot of money on belts, we finally trashed it and bought a Hoover."
1,NOISY!,"This vacuum is noisy! Especially when using the bare floor mode. When using the hose just for corners it functions well, and is not quite as loud, but regular vacuuming with this thing requires ear plugs. And the regular vacuum doesn't pick up that well. You have to use the hose to pick up small particles that you've gone over several times with the vac.All in all, I know this was refurbished, but for the money, it should work a heck of a lot better than this! I wouldn't recommend this item."
5,a good vacuume,I am very happy with this vacuume and the service I got from amazon. It is much quieter than others I have had.
3,Eureka R4870G - Could be better,"The Eureka R4870G is pretty noisy as far as vacuum cleaners go. It is difficult to maneuver, and heavier than most other models I've purchased. The button or latch that releases the vacuum to lie straight down and go under furniture is extremely difficult to press and engage. Also, the attachment tube for cleaning other areas had a small crack in it. These were the cons.On the plus side - it does vacuum nicely and the suction power is adequate. This is the first time I've purchased a Eureka - I'm not as pleased with the product as I have been in the past with others. I can't say that I highly recommend the product."
4,Great power; 2 glitches,"This really gets the dirt up, and the tools are easy to use. My complaint is with the way the hose wraps around the back -- it is continually flopping off of its keepers and getting in the way of the brushes. The other glitch is with the foot release pedal. It is a bit of a struggle getting the pedal to cooperate."
4,Refurbished Eureka R4870G Boss Upright Vacuum,"Fast delivery! But as refurbished indicates it's not in new condition. Clips to hold attachment on the molded backing was broken off, so there was no way that would work. The vaccuum was as advertised very good! So you get what you pay for. I bought for(89.00) 59.00 after a 30.00 deduction with the new Amazon credit card and free shipping. So I feel like the broken clips were a small thing for the money."
1,broke within days of warranty expiration,"this item was delivered on 1/4/11. I don't use it often because I have hardwood floors, but needed a vacuum for my rugs. it stopped working today - just days after the warranty expired. be careful purchasing refurbished items!"
5,Eureka !!,"We bought a Hoover a year ago and it would not vacuum the carpet at all. We fiddled with the beater bar. Nothing worked. We didn't want to spend $4-500 for a ""good"" vacuum. The first time my wife used the Eureka it picked up a 1/2 a bag. (She vacuums every few days) The Eureka is great!All for $75.00"
5,Vacuum Cleaner,"So far so good, I only used the vacuum cleaner 1x, but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it (refurbished). The only way I could tell it was refurbished is because it was almost assembled when we received it, so we didn't have to follow all the steps in the instruction manual.I ordered the vacuum on Monday and it was at my door on Thursday with free shipping through Amazon."
4,Truly a page turner...,"This book was absolutely amazing, and I was delighted to finally read something that lacked gaudy glamorization and pretense of any kind. Moore truly has a story to tell. And many of the accounts in this book stress exactly how disheartening the struggles of a gay black male can compound into a beast that is virtually impossible to tame.Despite my heavy workload and ferocious schedule, once I picked up this novel, I could not put it back down. Page after page I turned, and more and more, I became consumed with this story. Miquel is quite a character, and he is one whom the reader cannot help sympathizing with despite his warped views on the world around him and irrational decisions that he makes. I believe that we all have a story to tell, BUT the difference is that only some of those stories really captivate us. I was instantly hooked. Now, I cannot wait until the sequel. Kudos to this premier black novelist! E. Lynn Harris, meet you match!"
5,Inspiring people of color to overcome hurdles,"""FWIHID"" is a must-read for any person dealing with sexuality, especially men of color. We must learn to be ourselves unconditionally. I embrace novels about men of color who deal with the same issues that I deal with daily. Thank God I was never introduced to the drug lifestyle, however. Accolades to Mr. Moore for being able to tell his story, and for changing his lifestyle. Hopefully your book will be a catalyst for others to express their struggles about sexuality issues and the isolation that come with it. I can't wait to read the second book. Thanks to the editor for introducing this body of work to me. And, again, to the author for his courage. Be blessed and keep telling our stories!!!"
4,For What I Hate I Do,"I purchased this book after hearing about the author from a coworker. I actually purcahsed all three books of the series at the same time. I am glad that I did. I ended up reading the first book in about an hour. I was pleased with the story-telling, and the frank and honest way the author told his story."
4,Awesome Job,"I must say that W.M. Moore did an awesome job telling the story of a young man destined for greatness, but side tracked by internal demons. The book is a must read. It sheds light on a dark place that we dare not look. This piece of work was most needed for those who have found themselves or know of individuals in a similar situtation. I applaud the book and the author. Keep up the great work!!"
4,For What I Hate I Do,This was a very good book. The title represent how I felt during the first years of giving in to my own internals desires. I think that many who are SGL have experienced this.
4,Intense Auto-biography,"MW Moore spins an incredible tale of sports, drugs and sex in his first novel based on his own life. Some scenes were severe and others were easily understood no matter what your background...had a hard time understanding the lead character but felt connected to several of those in his life and was blown away by his strong representation of some Black Males within families across the United States.Moore brings a concise, dynamic voice to a character who had it all but chose to ignore it for the easy way out only to have his life come crashing down around him....in more ways than one."
4,Seriously Seeking the Sequel,"Wow...this book is definitely one you won't put down once you start reading! Whether or not it was the intent, so much in the book is quite believable, scary, sad but also containing some hope. A good book is one in which the reader finds him or herself talking to the characters, telling them what to do and not to do - this is such a book! A must read! Bring on the sequel!"
4,Refreshing and Amazing,"I bought this book from the author at an event in DC. While I was not interested in reading your sterotypical ""gay black male"" book, the book was pleasantly suprising. I started the book and had a very difficult time putting it down. Good job Mr. Moore on a job well done. Thank you for allowing us to have an invitation into your life."
5,About Time!,"Honestly, from the time I held this book in my hands, I was intrigued. The cover caught my attention so quickly, I knew it was going to stay by my side until the last word; come to find out, it was well worth it.WTG Mr. Moore, personally, acknowledging your success, with all you've gone through and accomplished, I physically see that with GOD, determination and support, anything is possible and my aspirations are not too far away.Thanks for the ride M.W., I'm anxiously awaiting the next."
4,The young man has skills!,"This book was referred to me by a great friend.It reminded me of my days of being a member of a track and field dynasty, indoors and outdoors.The story line was very easy to follow and allowed you to get to know each character. M.W. Moore shows great promise as a writer and being able to relate to the real issues of men,straight or gay.I think this book is very, very entertaining and I read it over a period of 10 hours. I had to know what was next and that my friends is when a writer has been given a gift. Check it out I think Mr.Moore has a great future ahead."
4,"""Rising Above Your Circumstances""","""For What I Hate I Do"" gives the reader a definitive perspective of the world in which some males experience when growing to become the man they desire to be. The author's narrative paints vivid pictures of the characters' lives and gives any reader, who may be seemingly living a reckless life, the encouragement to persevere."
5,Lamborghini restoration documentation,This is a most valuable coffe table book for providing restoration photo documentation. Some most important photos can be gleaned for high dollars restorations on Miura. Buy this book - miuraworkshop.com
5,Educational tool for the collector...,"...or wanna-be collector like me. The photographs are indescribable... lush, color-saturated but detailed enough to serve as authorative historical documentation of each individual instrument. I didn't realize Iwanade had included so much textual discussion in this book! He provides a glossary of terms frequently encountered in the esoteric world of 58-60 Les Paul sunbursts, as well as high-level information on the science of the finishing process, wood patterns (now I can tell birds-eye maple from blister), and the famous Paul tone as derived from the famous PAF pick-ups.This book is an indispensable tool for the serious collector or the amateur dreamer. All it's missing is a centerfold."
5,"Great for casual reading, or in-depth info!","This book is a must for anyone that appreciates the '58-'60 burst. It contains anything you would ever need to know about Les Pauls from this classic era. I purchased a spiral bound cover for my coffee table, which lays flat for easy reading. I had to get the hard cover, though, since they were limited to 1000 copies (I own copy #69), and include an extra profile not found in the softcover and spiral bound editions. This is about Ed King (Strawberry Alarm Clock, Lynyrd Skynyrd), and his '59 that was stolen. He did get it back 20 years later, after seeing it in the hardcover edition of this book. I am not sure why it was removed from the softcover or reprint editions."
5,Highly recommended.....,"Beautiful pictures, good interviews, and excellent information for musicians and collectors. What makes this book really stand out is how everything was presented...very well-organized and nicely thought out. The book concentrates on the years 1958, 1959, and 1960 Les Pauls. If you're curious about Gibson Les Pauls you should buy this book."
5,big surprise,The delivery was beforehand. The condition is reasonably good. I was so happy that I could surprise my boyfriend on his birthday.
5,Tres interressant ouvrage sur le Burst des Les Paul,"Outre la qualité des photos, la partie consacrée à la description precise des differentes Les Paul est essentielle."
2,"Not awful, but not too good either","I purchased this remote for my Ipod Video (30GB). When I first took it out of the box, I was very happy, its color is the same as my iPod (black) and it also has the same width.The unit fits OK with the iPod and the remote control is small and cool, but I found some flaws:1. The unit easily disconnects if you maneuver the iPod in the car, for example, and I don't mean a drastic movement.2. The remote control, it says up to 150ft.... yeah right, that is NOT true, even within the car (I have a small car) if you don't point the remote directly to the unit, it won't work. It also is kind of slow when you push the button to change a song and when the iPod actually change it.The reason I rate this with 2 stars is because the unit, when it works, takes away that uncomfortable task to change the song by touching the iPod itself."
2,Waste,"I had this footstool for about a half a year and then one day out of the blue I was playing and it just snapped, the wood surrounding the metal bar just split. It may be more appealing than a metal footstool but if your looking for asthetics look else where. Don't waste your money."
1,A Piece of Junk,"This stand looks sturdy but tended to collapse if my foot was placed even slightly off center, and it broke completely after about two weeks of use. Definitely not recommended."
2,not up to my standards,"The workmanship of this footstool was inferior, the finish was marred and dull. I had purchased it as a gift and had to buff and polish the wood to make it even presentable. It took over an hour to polish it and make it appear new. I would not recommend this product."
3,Too large,"The watch functions as advertised, but I found it too big and bulky for my wrist. I traded it in for a Casio DB36-1AV instead."
4,"Good Pacer, Short Lived Function Buttons","I've been using the Casio W752 model for over 5 years. I am currently on my 5th watch. The function buttons on the right-hand side of the watch wear out, fall off, or just quit functioning. I continue to purchase the model because it is inexpensive and has the pacer function that I use."
4,Grips you from the start!,Excellent story line that totally grips you from the start. I could hardly put it down while reading it. Its a futuristic mystery while making you reconsider your own thoughts and beliefs. It will anger some while others agree but overall an excellent read. I would highly recommend the book and believe that it would make a great movie.
3,love the beatles,"the album fcover was in pretty rough shape (2) pieces, but the lp itself sounds pretty good for 45 yrs old,,"
4,beatles 65 album,Beatles 65 album was in fair shape only but record was in mint to excellent shape which impressed me because I want to play therecords so sound quality is important to me and dealer delivered. Good purchase.
4,Good for beginners but really long-winded while missing details,"This book appears to be good for true beginners. It is, however, quite large and for its size still chooses to put some important details ""out of scope"". Its choice to remain with NASM, even in the Linux world, is a little frustrating and limits the books use.But it is an easy read, and does cover the most basic stuff (such as computer design, file formats, etc)."
3,Great Information - And Cure For Insomnia,"This book will teach you how to program in AssemblyNo doubt about that. But it WILL put you to sleep.If you can endure lengthy explainationsthen you may find this book useful.And you can always pick up little things from different sources.This is a great alternative source.Otherwise check out:""Assembly Language for Intel-Based Computers (4th Edition)""For a more fast paced, easier to understand method of coding ASM programs."
3,"Good teacher, but not up to date","If you have found other assebler books hard to understand, this is something to you. Duntemann could teach even an ape to write an assebler program.Unfortunately there is too much about DOS and 16-bit segmented mode. More about Linux, please. Assembler in Windows isn't so difficult that Duntemann claims.It is very pleasant book to read and it catches your attention in very rare way."
1,"First 150 pages rambling, without a hint on the real thing.","At page 151, author said ""That's why I began at the real beginning, and took 150 pages to get to where the other guys start.""That is really true, 150 pages wasted!!!The author is trying to be funny, but actually made it look even worse.If you are interested in assembly language, there are several online tutorials which are actually much better than this book."
1,Not very interesting,After reading Firebird which I thoroughly enjoyed I wanted to read everything by Janice Graham but I was very disappointed in The Tailor's Daughter. Too drawn out and not interesting or exciting at all. I found myself skipping pages looking for a part of the book that would hold my attention but it never happened.
5,The Tailors Daughter,The deafness will make you stop to think how deafness would affect each of us. It points out how impossible it is to truly understand what total deafness is like.If she hadn't been a teen-ager when she became deaf her life would have had even more challenges.It was good to read a book that was entertaining as well as thought provoking. Everyone in our book club enjoyed the book.
3,How much tragedy can a heroine take!,"I bought this book based on the reviews here at Amazon. It was a good read but somewhat difficult to believe with all the tragedies that the poor heroine suffers. Her Mom and brother die, she becomes deaf, she is nearly assaulted by her fathers employee, loves someone above her station and marrries him and then gets it annulled, has a child who is then stolen from her, etc! In the end I was depressed that nothing could go right for this poor girl. The last quarter of the novel suddenly morphs into a gothic tale with a tragic fire scene that sets us up for a HEA ending. I agree with the other reviewers that the ending was a little off and did not mesh well with the rest of the story.However by that time I was just desperate for the heroine to get a lucky break! Overall a good read, but the endless stream of tragedies was a little manipulative."
1,HORRIBLE.,"This book is the worst pick I've made in over a year. Long, drawn out, and tedious character/plot development-there was much more attention given to the details of the clothing than to the excitement of the story. I finally thought it was about to get good at page 300 or so, and from page 300 till page 360? It was great!! But after that, it bored right down to the same old tedious drivel.If I'd wantd a Harlequin romance, I would have purchased one for a lot less money than this book cost. Save your money- if you like historical fiction, try Phillippa Gregory or Anya Seton or Karleen Koen. Hell, even Robert Patterson is better than this! Just do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here."
5,Good stuff.,"Circulon Infinite is really good cookware for the money. I think it is as good as anything on the general market today. The cost is less than any comparable cookware. You will pay 3x for All-Clad and, it is no better."
2,slips,Much smaller than the other pads we have in the same size. Slips and rolls a lot on the leg and doesn't come clean when washed...can't get the smell out! YUCK!
4,mikasa knee pads,Mikasa has good knee pads that stay on your knees without slipping. They are light weight and not very bulky.
1,THIS IS NOT THE 810 KNEE PAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS NOT THE 810 KNEE PAD! The Mikasa 810 knee pad was discontinued years ago!! The picture is wrong. Google it.This is the 832sr knee pad/ but Amazon doesn't care about falsely representing products. They will not fix the product, and don't allow sellers to fix listing either. Don't get me wrong, the 832 is the best and newest pad on the market."
2,larger,"I wasn't sure what to expect for a ""senior item,"" but the only thing I see different is that they are for a person with extra large knees. I'm a woman, 5'11"" and these knee pads are a tad too large for my knees. I live overseas so didn't have much choice. I needed them right away so had them made smaller by a seamstress. They are fine now....but, only get them if your knees are a bit larger than ""normal."""
5,Good product,"Mikasa brand is one of the best specialized on volleyball. This kneedpads are very comfortable and long lasting, good shape; but could be better if you can find them in optional sizes."
1,Did nothing for me,"Tried it a couple of nights taking the max dose and felt nothing.It may work for some people but not hardcore insomniacs like myself.What did work was lemon Balm, Valarian root and L Theanine combined."
2,Not necessarily worth it.,"This product is kind of a let down, it tastes weird and doesn't really do anything. I purchased to help me sleep through the night and to stay a little calmer at work (which is stressful during the holiday season.) This product was really no help, but sort of what I was expecting. You can't expect that an herb is going to fix things for you."
1,Not what I ordered.,The Sanford(R) Prismacolor(R) Col-Erase(R) 20045 pencil in the picture and item heading is what I was required to purchase for my Dental Hygiene clinicals. So I ordered the item on this page. When the box showed up it contained generic red seminary pencils which might be good if you need a general red pencil for your church activities but is not at all what I ordered or need for my classes. Big dissapointment. One star because you can't give zero.
5,great speakers,"Insanely good speakers, good build quality, good volume, great clarity and crispness, insane highs maybe too much even. the bass is a little lacking needs to be coupled with a sub but i think it was desinged to be.after adding in a sub they sound awesome."
5,healthy cookies sugar free,"Joseph's Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread Cookies, 11 oz bagsFrom Amazon very good and tasting clean. Better for my heath and low on calories"
1,TASTE AWFUL,TASTE LIKE CARDBOARD. THEY ARE TINY. THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THEM EDIBLE IS IF YOU PUT THEM IN A TIN CAN WITH 2 SLICES OF BREAD TO MAKE THEM SOFT AND NOT HARD AS ROCKS.
1,Disgusting,"The worst cookies I have ever tasted. Hard and not chewy at all. Dunked in milk made it better but way too expensive. The shipping was absolutely ridiculous. Made them very expensive, especially when they and the other flavors I've bought are so gross. Will never buy this product again."
1,amazon,i'm very disappointed that it has been more than 30 days since my order and i still have NOT received my book.
1,Won't work with ipod classic,Won't work with the latest newest Ipod classic. This is a convenient gadget and transferred hundreds of pictures on vacation for me with my original ipod. Then the ipod was stolen and the latest greatest ipod won't work with the camera connector now all I get is hardware not supported.A good gadget rendered useless. I'm desperate for it to work again!
5,Yummy,"I love books by Debra Webb, this one didn't dissapoint me.If you like her books don't miss this one. It might not be her newest but still worth the read."
2,sizzled then fizzled,"A few years back, I read Morrison's ""Sula"" and gave it 5 stars, I loved the intimate nature of her poetic writing in that particular book. I've tried reading other books by her, but gave up out of confusion or boredom. ""Love"" the audiobook read by the author was very confusing to this reader, but at the same time very interesting. I just let her read on in her laid back intimate style in what seemed to be random thoughts and at other times provacative dialogue between characters. Slowly I started to grasp who all these characters were to each other and was really enjoying the book. However the last few parts were even more confusing and I'm not really sure what happened in the end, I was just glad it was over.Maybe just not my style of reading entertainment. A lot of sex, sleaze and sleazy characters. Her use of imagery is great. A lot of the characters dialogue is truly riveting. The storyline just fizzled nowhere for me."
1,Disappointed,"I know Toni Morrison fans may not agree with me but ""Love"" is a real flop - at least in my opinion. The book was so boring that I could not get past the first 2 pages of the very first chapter. I couldn't get into the introduction either, so I decided to by-pass it. I read the same two pages over and over again for two days on my hour and a half commute home. It was so slow....and she had to explain every single detail about every single person or object. I couldn't take it. I'm going to give the book to one of my co-workers......she's going to attempt to read it. I'm really not trying to be mean or overly critical because I know that she's an excellent writer. I just wanted to express my view. And my view is to focus on another one of her books."
1,inquiry?,"I can't find another route to ask this question! I wrote a review of Morrison's love (about a week ago, I think), but it never appeared, aand I'm wondering why!Thanks-"
3,"Love, Love, Love","This was the first title by Toni Morrison that I have ever read. The book was well written, but at times confusing. The ending of the book shows two friends coming together through LOVE. I believe the book if read slowly can be very enjoyable"
3,love,"Toni Morrison's newest novel ""Love"" combines the elements and themes of all her novels in a seemingly simple tale. On some level all of her novels address the issues of friendship, love and ghosts of the past. This tale reminds me of her earlier novels such as ""Tar Baby"" and ""Sula"" because it is not as ambiguous in its narratives as her later novels. The women in the novel all love the mysterious Bill Cosey in the novel. However, the love in this novel is not romantic but human. The love is flawed and by the end of the novel the characters will come to terms with this knowledge. Morrison is known for her women characters so the character of Romen was a breath of fresh air. I especially enjoyed the character of Romen who represented the struggle of not only coming to terms with manhood but the struggle to be his true self. Even though this novel is not her best it still is better than its predecessor ""Paradise."" Overall, I truly enjoyed reading this novel."
3,Love,This book was somewhat confusing at times. I read to re-read passages to try to get the understanding of what was happening and then after re reading I still did not know what was going on. Her transtions from point of views leave you wondering who is speaking because there is no transition. One minute one character is speaking then the next someone else is speaking and you wouldn't know this happened untill you finished a paragraph or two. ALthough at first I was falling asleep while reading this book. Towards the end I found myself compelled to read what would happen next. All in all this is a good read.
3,Confusing!,"Love is beautifully written; however, at times the plot is hard to follow. Some of the confusion is cleared up later in the book, but by the time you get there you've already encountered more puzzling details. This is not a book you will be able to read with the t.v. going and the kids running in and out. Despite that problem, the book is definitely a page turner, written in a way that makes you almost feel the breeze coming off the ocean when reading it."
4,Two sides to every story,"LOVE is (at first) confusing with the constant switching of views; however, the more you read, the more clarity invoked. It's a story that requires your undivided attention or else you risk having to reread the story just to get the point lost. It's a lesson of what happens when people dwell more on what was wrong rather than what was right with another human being. It doesn't read like other Toni Morrison novels I've read; yet it still exudes her idiosyncratic depth. Overall, it was an enjoyable story and a recommended read.Reviewed by Ess Maysof The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersComplete review can be found on our website..."
2,disappointing,"ever since reading 'the bluest eye' at the age of 10 or 11, i have always loved reading toni morrison's novels. unfortunately, i have to say that 'love' left me with an unsatisfied feeling.it started off really well, i found it thoroughly engaging, and was intrigued in finding out what the source of all the hostility between heed and christine was all about, but by the time i reached the end of the novel i had lost interest in all of the characters and, quite frankly, it felt like toni morrison may have as well."
4,also love of self,"More than anything this is my comment about how that teenage? girl is suddenly driven into accepting herself when the boy kisses her toe and accepts her deformity. How that instantly changes her, breaks down her wall of defence, and in the process probably also leaving her less mysterios and therefore less attractive in that darkly sexual manner.For me that was one of the highlights while reading the book. It is very insightful of Toni to write around the event the way she did.Overall, and compared to other books by her, it's a story that left me feeling warm, almost the same way Song of Solomon did, not too depressed the way Beloved did. It is also much easier to read through, not becasue it's a simple and easy story to tell but maybe because Toni really wanted readers to enjoy the book and at the same time take something from her thoughts.So thumbs up to love.... and to South Africa for winning the soccer world cup bid, if you don't mind!"
2,"Papa's Dead, Who's Got The Will?","That's about all I could get from this tedious story. I just could not follow it, could not understand parts of it, particularly how Junior fit into the story. I have an idea, but I could be wrong. Thank goodness Morrison spelled out the relationship between Heed and Christine or I'd still be lost. I will say that Morrison has a beatiful writing style. The way she puts words on a page is really incredible, but the way this story evolved just left me confused."
4,This book promotes important life skills through activities.,I would highly recommend this book for parents or educators. It provides many short creative thematic activities with clear easy directions to follow. These help develop valuable lessons for our children while making the entire learning experience fun. You will always find further resources if needed along with stimulating quotes along the way. Geared for grades 3-6.
1,This book should be called Math No-Games,"There is not one game in the whole book, just a ""how to do math"" book. Not at all what the title says!"
1,Not A Game In Sight,"This book has explanations of how math works but does not contain MATH GAMES FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL. It has sections titled ""Math Camp"" that give example questions for the concepts discussed earlier in the chapter. No middle schooler I have ever taught (in over 25 years of classroom experience) would consider doing word problems a 'game'. Practicing math facts and skills needs to be motivating for all students but for middle school students in particular it is a challenge to find a game that they want to play that also teaches them. The Math Camp format is not that. The title of this book is misleading. If you are looking for practice questions and techniques for teaching specific skills, it would be moderately helpful."
1,A disservice to Mario Salvadori,"I knew the late Mario Salvadori and have been a fan of his work. This is obviously a hack job with some of his ideas, then his name slapped on the cover to make it saleable. This book is a train wreck: old problems, no math games to speak of, and it reads like an abbreviated middle school textbook. This is a terrible book and an insult to Mr. Salvadori's memory.If you want a genuine math book for middle schoolers, look to Harold Jacobs' Mathematics: A Human Endeavor, which after 40 years is still the best general interest math book with humor and insight."
4,"Lessons, not multiplayer games","This book does not have games that involve multiple players or competition. Rather, it is a set of lessons that explains middle school math concepts from the ground up using concrete examples and analogies. There are word problem sets for each lesson, with answers at the back. The text is very accessible and could be used by a student for self-instruction."
1,Sad book.,"It is very sad that this is the only available book in English dealing with quite obscure topic of Slovak history. The author is a known defender of the First Slovak Republic (aka Slovak state) during the WWII and his positions are very close to a ""national socialist"", i.e., fascist. Moreover, his romantic approach to Slovak medieval history is preposterous. For somebody interested in this topic it may be a useful reading what is NOT a Slovak history. Hopefully, in the near future we will have translations of books written by respected historians (Kirschbaum is neither)."
2,selective historical nationalism,"This book had a shocking and noticeable bias that can be summed up as nationalistic history. Although this is one of the few books on Slovak history, it was disturbing to read as the author sugar coated the Nazi collaboration under Josef Tiso in the Chapter ""The Slovak Republic, 1939-1945"", as if the goal of national self-determination justified his actions during this time period."
1,Canon makes junk chargers for there mini Dv Camera's,"I bought this Canon Vistura DV camera 5 years ago and have gone through 3 of these units. I called canon there reply was you can buy another one for 150.00 Can dollars. Im on the look for another one( used) as this one has croaked as well I asked the service tech if it was my camera he said no Canon makes ""cheap chargers"". I will be selling this unit as soon as I get a charger for it . A canon will not be on the replacement list"
1,Not worth the money,"I thoroughly agree with the other two reviews about how crappy this power adapter is. The first one I had for my Canon Ultura video camera just quit working one day. I had bought an extended warranty on the camera, but quickly found out the adaptor wasn't covered. I then purchased another one for $125.00 in Feb., 2002. Now this one doesn't work and I will have to replace it again. I called Canon and they said they couldn't help me out and said I would have to buy another one. This leaves you between a rock and a hard place because the camera is totally useless unless you can recharge the $50.00 batteries. I told them I'd never buy another Canon video camera, which is true. I'm going back to Sony!"
1,Ripped Off,"This is an absolute travesty. $150.00 for a crappy ac/dc adapter? These things cost less than a buck to make. I can understand up to $30.00, but a hundred and fifty bucks is plain old taking advantage of people. I'm sure glad my other camera is a Sony. Canon is a terrible company to do this to people."
5,"Hate snakes, love Diamondback","Janet Evonovich move over. Taylor Madison is a terrific heroine. She's spunky, likable, inventive and knows how to stir the pot. If you hate snakes, like I do, you'll feel like a well-protected voyeur as you slither through this engaging story. The book is very well written, a grabber from page one with a cast of characters you'll enjoy to the very end. I loved Hazel, Taylor's pet ferret. Made me want to run right out and buy one. Then I remembered they're illegal in California. Ah well, I'll just have to wait for the next Taylor Madison book. This is one of those books once you start reading you just want to keep right on going until you reach the end. If you don't have this book, it's a must read for mystery lovers. Put it on the top of your TBR stack and get started. You'll love every page."
3,very disappointed,"The author doesn't use quotation marks! I found this very distracting. I had to keep re-reading passages because I thought someone was thinking but the next person responded to their thought, so it must have been said out loud. I thought the mystery was telegraphed early on. By then I didn't care ""who done it"" and didn't want to try to decipher the dialogue any more."
3,Lack of quotation marks is distracting,"The story is good, and pretty well written. However, the lack of quotation marks in the book is distracting. My mind is having to process what is spoken and what isn't. Wish it was done more conventially..."
2,Drastically reduced price is misleading,"Although this quilt is okay for the price, the quality is such that I would never dream of paying more than $35 for it. I was a little disappointed because I like the heaviness and softness and fine stitching of luxury bedding--and this quilt, unfortunately, does not exhibit those qualities. The old saying is true; you get what you pay for. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Misleading add:-(..,I purchased this perfume bcoz its shows Eau de Parfums but this seller sent the Millesime Spray and they said that this perfume only comes in Millesime Spray..not a happy camper...need my money back please!!!
1,An awful book.,"This is one of the worst books written on a rock subject because Marsh completely fawns over this guy. Springsteen, in Marsh's eyes, can do no wrong. To Marsh, every record he put out is brilliant, every quote Springsteen says should be taken as gospel. You get some insight into his recording process, but the way Marsh absolutley loves this guy makes reading this book very difficult. I can understand liking a persons' music and who he is but as a professional journalist Marsh takes it WAY overboard. Marsh should have shown at least some ojective restraint, but he doesn't...."
3,A little creepy,"First off, let me say that I really liked ""Born To Run"", the first part of this story, when it came out. I bought ""Glory Days"" hoping for more of the same, only to find that Dave Marsh had apparently gone from being a fan of Bruce Springsteen to being something of an apostle of the man. I guess that's fine for some, but although I'm a fan of some of his music, I can't see anything about Bruce that would lead me to think he walks on water. A little bit of objectivity could have gone a long way in this book."
1,IT SUCKS BIG TIME -- DO NOT BUY!!!,"This is simply the worst of all xcode books. it should be called xcode document! instead of Beginning... It has no sample or practice page at all. NONE! ZILT! ZERO! if you want to learn xcode from examples this is NOT for you but if you just wanted to read what xcode means! then by all mean waste your money on it. I wish I could call the author and ask him for a full refund now! After reading the above 2 reviews, I decided to buy. Well I don't know what they were smoking when wrote the review. I would give it a negative 2 stars if I could. STOP! DO NOT BUY!"
3,"Looks nothing like the picture, but I'll give it a chance","This is a ball ornament, good sized, with some sort of light in it. I'll update my review when I get new batteries as the ones it arrived with are dead. As long as it works, i'm good. The picture makes it look like a flat, glass, etched ornament. It's a common (large) round bulb of an ornament which will be worth the price when it lights up I'm sure. I'm just a bit disappointed that I didn't get what I expected from the picture, as an online seller myself, it's very important that the product and picture be as one. I repeat -I will update my review, this could be a good product. If it had looked like the picture, I would have waited to give the review..."
1,Not bad . . . just not great.,The dialogue seemed a bit cheesy and it would have been nice if things were explored a bit more. Would've like to have known what the grandfather had done/said to the grandson before he died.
5,pleasantly surprised...,"...at the excellent condition this book arrived in. It's a beautiful book with lots of great info, too."
4,Worth every penny,"I really enjoyed the shipping service, I received my shoes without delayI am really happy with the quality of the shoes, the upper is sturdy and the heels are balanced, so much so I was able to wear my shoes to work and keep them on all day pain free:-)"
5,MrsMinister,"Bought one for myself, one for hubby over a year ago. Still working great! Coffee (me) and tea(him) taste SO much better in BPA-free ceramic! Highly recommend."
4,"Great, but slow.","It took four episodes to get going. Each episode moved sluggishly. Yet, the final few reveals made it all worth it.It was the same feeling as being read to when you can read faster in your head... yet, again, it was a great story.If you have a ton of time on your hands this is really worth it, but if you're not willing to invest, then try a newer series that is faster paced."
3,Its alright....,"The animation is similar to Witch Hunter Robin...and the tempo is about the same as well. All in all its pretty good, but kind of slow. IMO worth picking up and watching once, but i doubt that you will give it a second go through."
4,Fun candles,"Our family always likes to burn a candle on the kitchen table so these are great on top of an old wine bottle. I would have given five stars, but the candles could use a little more color in them."
1,Orthodox Catholics Beware!,"A few minutes into this uninspiring documentary on Teresa of Avila, I saw some woman with a 'butch-cut' hairstyle and wearing roman collar being interviewed. The subtitle referred to her as a priest. I stopped the DVD, and threw it in the trash! No further review necessary.JB"
5,She's Tops in New Zealand,"Visiting New Zealand for Christmas of 2000, Anastacia was tops on the charts and in the record stores. I got this CD there and almost wore it out, and gave it to a friend thinking that I could get another copy here....after visiting many record stores, music places, a few had the single, only Amazon had the CD at double the price I paid overseas! I'm having a friend mail me a copy from NZ, but anyone who can, should get this CD. How refreshing to hear someone with soul. It's a crime that she's not being recognized more here. Makes you wonder what else is out there?"
3,interesting mix of songs,"Tracks 1-5 have somewhat heavy beats and a bit of an '80s flair. They are great for singing in the car, or while on the treadmill at the gym. The rest of the CD becomes suddenly mellow, background music. I wish Anastacia had done a dance CD, and a ballad CD, rather than mixing them half and half. Thank goodness for minidisc recorders! Overall, a pretty good listen, but not the most original material."
2,Disco Diva,"First off, I love Anastacia. She's got an amazing voice, one that really knocks Jessica Simpson off the block, but unfortunately, this album didn't deliver quite what I expected, or like so much. I was expecting more of an R&B kinda thing, not to the extreme, but much more than it shows up on this album; however, some songs that I love are: ""Why'd you like to me"", ""Ask of you"", ""Don't you wanna"", and ""Black roses"". Anastacia is a heartfelt singer, and I'll be buying her latest LP when I get I paid."
3,Pretty Good,listening to this Album puts me into the frame of Mind of Chaka Khan 79 with Rufus Working with Quincy Jones&Donna Summer's 83 working with Q.that kind of Feeling&Vibe.The Ups is that Anastacia is a solid Vocalist&Has Promise the down is the feeling&Lack of Drive.that comes with time but this isn't a Bad Album.it's lacking the overall drive that will make you really take notice now but if She maintains Her Focus&Her Voice isn't Watered Down watch out.
5,AWESOME NEW TALENT IN ANASTACIA!!!!!!!!!,"I have waited a few months for this CD! I bought her first two singles. They are NOT THAT KIND and I'M OUTTA LOVE and loved them!! I knew if the rest of her debut was as great, I would be in music heaven! Today, the cd was finally released.... I just finished listening to it and I must say I am so happy!!! Every track is absolutely amazing! She can be fiesty and full of grit and spunk on one track and the next be emotional and sing a great ballad! She is truly amazing! Her voice is a very husky raspy sort of sound and I love it!! Anyone who wants to hear a great new artist, go pick this album up! You will be glad you did! GO ANASTACIA!!! I also saw her on Elton John's special and was amazed at her stage presence!"
4,A New Superstar,"When I first heard Anastacia, I thought it was Taylor Dayne, & with a smimilar voice which could knock a bull over, this debut album packs a real punch & covers a plethora of musical styles. The neo-funk of the album's title-track opener is a catchy affair & is built upon by the world-wide smash of the first single, I'm Outta Love, which is a rollercoaster ride of a song which makes you wanna move. The remainder of the album however is not an entirely uptempo affair, but what it dies reveal is the textured richness of Anastacia's voice and captivating balladry. With all songs co-written by the gal herself ( and a notable collaboration with Sturken & Rogers), Anastacia has proven herself to be a woman with a sense of orientation as well as talent, which will help her & Sony bring her to the top of her game. Watche this space."
1,flop hulla hoop sound!,forget it! spice girls are not much better either than she is.the songs are poppy but without any inspiration. she cannot convince us how to play the instruments!
2,Not so great,"I thought this cd was going to be a secret gem, but I could barely listen to the whole thing. Not worth the $."
1,what the hell is wrong with you people!!!!??????!!!!??,"Are strong vocal cords enough these days to get you people to believe that this like the next whitney???what the hell????this is the biggest bull ive ever heard in my life.i am a lover of talent.i will not listen to artists that posses none of it.But when you got a pair of giant vocal chords and u just scream like crazy, go and get yourself a job in a nightclub.anastacia's voice is rough,and posseses no feeling whatsoever.a set of vocal chords is not enough to turn a singer into a true artist.and did i mention that her songs are just very average,heart it before pop songs,. so anastacia, go home."
1,Are you joking?,"Are you joking? 5 stars? If I could give this book 0 stars, I would. This is not even poetry! It's unimaginative thoughts chopped up to give the appearance of a poem. I got no image or feeling from reading these.Here is a sample poem:Is is thatyou starve a feverand feed a cold?Or is it the otherway around?Considering this dilemmaI think I'll justfeed both!Now if a friend said that to me in passing I would get a little chuckle but as a poem?!?! It's just not even original. I am sure she is a wonderful woman. From the title's of her other books it seems like is all about empowering women. Stick to that."
4,An Eccentric Treasure Dream,"ANLALF are often compared directly to the likes of My Bloody Valentine and Stereolab, but I believe this is selling them short. While these influences are incredibly apparent, they are never taken for granted. On ""Turning Into Small"" the band blends surreal pop ether with eccentric electronic loops and twitches. The faded, whispy vocals floating inside the warm textures are reminiscent of MBV but are used to different purposes, which are more playful than passionate. This album in compared with their others, offers a more ""electronic-heavy"" approach, while it doesn't outweigh the atmosphere the band often possesses, it is a little more direct on this offering. With the right ears, this is one album that will not disappoint, instead bringing you back to further and ultimately enjoyable listenings."
4,Not for the light hearted,Not a beginner's book but I don't think it was intended cover that ground.The only big complaint was the Web MVC chapter. It made a lot of assumptions that wheren't covered until the Web View chapter. It might have been better to cover these topics together then have a advanced chapter on things like uploading and wizard functionality.
3,not very much intresting,"bought this book long back,kind of boarting book,its standard kind tricks has written therealthough you can try it, but its boaring too"
3,"Great intro, now outdated.","A couple of years ago, this was a great introduction to the Spring Framework. Now it's a decent set of out-of-date pointers.It's great background reading. Buy it if you can get it cheap, since there are more-modern (i.e., better for the now) books.This book is simply a casualty of Spring's success: There's *so* much being integrated into the framework, and the framework's getting better at such a rapid pace."
3,Not an intro to the Spring Framework,"I bought this book because I have heard lots of good things about Spring on online forums and I wanted to know what all the hoopla was about. I am an experienced JavaEE programmer but have zero experience with Spring. I have read the first two chapters of the book and I have yet to see a complete example. It is hard for a Spring novice (like me) to visualize how everything ties together.If you have some Spring experience and want to learn more this book might be useful, but if you are looking for an introduction to Spring this book will not fit the bill."
2,"Fluff, there are better choices","This book is almost identical to the Spring developer's guide available on the web site. They follow the same chapters and format, and provide little new information, maybe some code. But once you start to get into Spring and use it, you'll want a reference that is more in depth. With this book, you'll find yourself struggling to find the details by browsing google and javadocs all day. Pro Spring is a better book that gives you more insight into how Spring works. My background is providing a services interface layer for a J2EE portal. I'm not developing the MVC so I didn't pay attention to those parts of the book."
3,May be a challenge for a beginner,"I think this is a book you would use as a reference for getting deeper into the understanding of concepts and being aware of the options for configuration and implemention of various aspects of the framework. But you would need to already understand the basics of Spring.If you want a Spring tutorial that will help you start building Spring applications from basic concepts, especially if you are a beginner, you may struggle with this book. You get explanation of concepts and code snippets, but you may need to read other books and online articles that are written more in a tutorial style."
4,"Give it up, and GO GET IT!","Critical Mass has an energetic sound your sure to enjoy. If you like Ska tunes, this is certainly the best damn album you won't want to overlook adding to your collection. The group's ability to write their own quality music and lyrics is very refreshing in the day and age where many groups copy each other's sound (noted in examples of : CM's unique songs ""Pisco,"" ""Class Clown,"" and ""Jeff's Chicken""). Add these songs to an occasional remake such as The Beatles' ""Good Morning, Good Morning,"" and you have an album you're sure to enjoy. Check it out! And by the way, the band will be releasing their second album by the middle of this year. DON'T MISS IT - I'M TELLIN' YA'!"
5,It's Real,"This is the authentic ""real"" SF baseball cap. There is a lot of cheap Chinese knock-off on the internet; E bay, etc. Very happy with the product. I trust this vendor."
2,Dawn's Comments on Recent Purchase,"I requested and paid for three day shipping. Amazon said it would be delivered on a certain day. Then when it got to the company actually sending it, it was another five days after that. You guys need to get your shipping issues together, if you offer three day then it should be three day not eight...Dawndaylia Graves"
3,"NOT ""Made in the USA""","I have ordered and returned this cap twice. I was assured that the cap was ""Made in the USA"" as stated in the item description after returning the first cap, but both caps I received clearly stated on the label ""MADE IN CHINA."" It's a nice hat, but I try not to shop for items made in China. Very disappointing.MLB San Francisco Giants Authentic On Field Game 59FIFTY Cap (Black)Updated on 5/30/2012Amazon Customer Service remedied the issue. Happy with Amazon. The hat is nice, but all inventory is ""Made in China."""
3,Fitted baseball cap,"The cap was well made anf the official product however, the sizing is off. I always order a 7 3/8. This was too large. Not true to size."
1,Author is very rude,"I contacted the author, Sheila Mello, to purchase this title directly from the publisher. Sheila was very rude and unhelpful. She hung up on me once. After contacting her again she told me that it was too much trouble for her to sell me one copy and said to go elsewhere. Personally, this is very bad business and not a good way to promote your book."
4,A to Z Hints for the Vegetable Gardener,"The most helpful reading I've encountered. Laid out in a literal A to Z format where you can look for ideas on Mulching (when, how and what material) or harvesting & storing. Written in everyday layman's terms that even I can understand. i.e. worms are good for your soil, etc. Literaly hundredreds of tips such as companion planting (what veggies make good neighbors) or how to inmprove your watering habits for maximum flavor and/or yield."
5,A to z Hints for the vegetable garden,I already had a copy and wanted one for my friend. It came in very good condition I feel even the most knowelagable gardener could learn something. Paula
4,EXCITING!,"I enjoyed seeing all the panty shots and about 3 times you could see bare pubic areas of gals in fights. One was very certain and obvious. This was Melissa. She got into a fight and ended up on the floor on her back with her already short skirt up to her waist. Her legs were spread too. The very thrilling part was that she had on NO PANTIES. Her bare spread-apart crotch was blatantly on display, though the camera catches it from the side view. It is very fast. You need to see it on slow motion, and she is in the background of the fight. Look for Melissa near the end of the tape. You may write me at vhwhite(at sign)juno.com if you want to suggest other tapes I would enjoy seeing. Vince"
5,""" Shocked""!","A basic shock for a basic purpose on an average car. (Rav-4).Serves it's purpose well in the rear and keeps my oversized Tires from bouncing and becoming "" saw toothed"".These are hydraulic not gas, fine for what I needed."
5,Read This Now! A Fresh Breeze From France.,"I recently attended Michel Serres first anglo appearnce at Memorial University in St. John's Newfoundland. `The Natural Contract' is a way of thinking and behaving as human beings should with Nature via a Natural Contract (i.e., an extension of contracterian philosophy). The idea is so simple and affecting, the writing so beautiful and clear, that this shouts for more attention. Serres the man is beautiful and kind and his `Natural Contract' is a good antedote for much of the radicalism in environmental ethics/animal rights these days."
4,Will stir you up,"Even if philosophy isn't your thing, this is a fun and interesting read that begs for you to argue with it. Serres writes beautifully and with great attention, and will carefully build up his argument only to flourish it with outrageously grand statements. It is so wonderfully phrased, though, that it's easy to ride the whole way with him.This is a great book to read when considering man's relationship with nature, or the nature of contracts in general."
2,"LOTS OF RESEARCH, BUT WAY TOO SHALLOW","I have read every book so far about this murder. The magic aspect of this story is captivating and frightening. But this book totally makes it boring! Lots of research and no personal stuff. I can see that he toured the city, spoke to the police, read the trial transcripts and reads scores of books about the history of Mexico but I can also see that he never spoke to a single cult member and knows nothing of them to this day. The book lacks the personal side, the insiders ""scoop"" that makes for a great crime book. Don't waste your time with this book. If you want to read about the history of Mexico, read a text book. If you want to read about the Constanzo cult, read BURIED SECRETS. It has a dumber name... but a much better story."
2,Decent...... but lacking,"It is a decent book, the author has put quite a bit of research into it. But he stuffed it with superfluous words, as I am doing, to make his word count and page mumber increase. he repeats himself constantly, and dwells on unnecessary information. A decent book for a pleasure read, but not too usefull for research."
5,Well Worth It,"I got this strap for my Canon HV20 HD camcorder.Anyone who owns a camera or camcorder is aware of the Photography Corollary to Murphy's Law: If you leave it at home or in the hotel room, you're sure to miss something awesome. For this reason, it's essential that you keep your camcorder with you at all times.This strap gives you a third option, in addition to being in your hand or in a protective bag. You're not going to win any fashion awards with a bulky camcorder hanging around your neck, but you will be ready for cool shot at a moment's notice.The strap is high-quality, strong, comfortable, and light-weight. It should've been included in the box with the camcorder, but it's fairly inexpensive, and an essential accessory in my opinion."
1,$20 joke from Canon,"I can't believe Canon didn't include a strap on their Hi Def camcorders. I had an old, out-of-order Sony camcorder. So I am using that strap (that works as good) instead of spending for a strap that should have been included with the camcorder to begin with."
4,Atmosphere of time well caught,"There are 448 references to Mr Miller and 89 to the Andrews Sisters on Amazon so why is this double CD worth acquiring? One, it has cherry picked 36 fifteen minute broadcasts; Two, it has been given careful audio restoration; Three, the performances have an excitement and immediacy featuring a range of performances from old favourites like Bei Mir Bist Du Schon to rarities like The Little Red Fox, as well Mr Miller stretches his band out on the likes of Runnin' Wild. Four, the accompanying notes and photos are worthy of the reissue."
5,Bud & Travis concert,"I have long been a fan of this duo. The vinal disc of the concert was greaaaaaat, but this CD gives so much more and is a joy to listen to,"
5,very good,"Service and helpful info was very good as was the shipping and delivery, it arrived before they said it would."
5,I am buying this book again...,"I love this book. So much so, that I am purchasing this book for my mother as a gift. The pictures are beautiful, and I love just flipping through it from time to time. I have made several cookies and all that I have tried turned out very good, no problems with the recipes so far!"
4,Sensational cookies,A great book filled with excellent recipes. Would like to have a photo with each recipe so I can see what they look like. Many lovely recipes are without photos.
5,An outstanding book - a must for the baker,"Walter's has created a modern treasury of recipes here; they range from the classics, updated a bit for modern tastes (which she explains in the headers to the recipes), to flavorful recipes such as her Macadamia Nut cookies,shortbread, and Pistachio Lime cookies, which are so wonderful and citrusy that they will now become a permanent fixture in my home. Her Viennese Butter cookies include the addition of hard-cooked egg yolk, something that I haven't seen in modern cookbooks, but have seen in older ones. My grandmother used to make her cookies that way.Best of all, Walter provides meticulous, comprehensive instructions that are invaluable to a beginning baker. The measurements are given in cups and teaspoons, and the recipes are geared towards a home cook.The book is full of wonderful photographs. If you follow her directions exactly, you will have success. I love this book."
3,If you have the time,"If you have lots of time and patience, you might be able to produce the results shown in these beautifully photographed cookies. Even though I committed the error of not thoroughly reading all of the steps before I started the ebony and ivory tiles, I couldn't believe that when I came to step 4, the directions did not continue to the next page, which left me with the problem of what to do next. Plus, what is a batarde? After looking this up in many dictionaries, I finally found out it is a loaf of white bread. White bread? So the step 4 directions say ""Using a batarde or... (at this point the recipe skips to step 5!) Help! I want to have fun when baking, not a headache.I also agree with the previous writer about the frivolous write-ups starting each recipe. The cookies are good, but not that good. I'll be sticking to the ""easy"" recipes and making sure that there are no editing errors that will leave me guessing."
3,Sentimental and repetitive,"It's 1963 and Clara Barton, ""The Angel of the Battlefield,"" is in Hilton Head, SC, awaiting the Union forces' attack on Charleston. She prepares her supplies, falls in love with a married man and has an affair, and becomes a sleuth, tracking down the psychotic who has stalked her and terrorized the community.Barton is one of my heroes, so I enjoyed seeing what Day did in her fictionalization, even if it doesn't ring true with what I already know about her. I also adore the South Sea Islands area of the U.S., and Day more than does justice to the natural beauty of the area and its people. A nice subplot has Barton helping a young black boy become literate and find a future. The horrors of our Civil War are also brought to life well.But the book's pace is too slow, and Barton's bodice-ripping romance is a bit amateur. Any reader of the murder-mystery genre will find the stalcker entirely predictable.Get it at the library."
2,I was very disappointed,"I was very excited to read this book as I have just discovered the Fremont Jones series by the same author. Dianne Day calls her book ""Cut to the heart"" a fictional work set within a historical framework. Its main character is Clara Barton, founder the Red Cross. Ms. Day uses Clara's unpublished diaries and other historical papers in this book. While I enjoy biographies and mysteries I felt that this book did not mix the two together very well. I found that the book was very slow and not very mysterious and I had to force myself not to skip to the ending. I also found myself indifferent to Clara Barton."
1,Beware!,"If you are a Fremont Jones fan, you are not likely to enjoy this book. I was so repulsed and disgusted by the story line that I stopped reading about 1/3 of the way through, checked the last chapter and threw the book away. It is not up to the standards that Ms. Day has previously achieved under the name of Dianne Day."
4,"Good story, improbable","Others have described the story, my only comment would be that X turns in a good performance as a cold-hearted sex worker, afraid to be close to anymore. ""Noah"" from Noah's Arc plays a very different character and shows that he is a solid actor."
5,Brilliant Movie,"This is a fantastic movie! Even for those who don't usually enjoy 'gay' movies, this is brilliantly done"
4,One of the Best,"This is one of the best (male) gay oriented films I've ever seen. The lead character, the prostitute, his appeal escapes me sometimes - since so much of the film hinges upon this appeal - but other times he totally pulls me in. It helps the actor has exceptionally beautiful eyes. The other leads, a famed European actor, and a young actor who has the lead role in the LOGO series NOAH'S ARK, are both good, and have compelling character arcs. So does a nymphette type, male variety, in the youngest of the roommates, who has - let's say - an open door policy. There is drama, romance, resistance to romance and all the obligations that entails, and also humor. Plus some mystery and basically the story of a new type of family. Too bad more use couldn't have been made of its Seattle based location, however."
3,Could have been?,"There were so many reasons to like this movie. The main character is smolderingly sexy. He narrates it, so you obviously see his point of view. The older male in the movie is from an even older Columbo series, and he played the murderer in it. I suppose that was solely my problem when I watched it, but he did make me cringe a bit. (Old men kissing is such a damn turn off) Other than that...the movie was entertaining but I always crave more young male on male love scenes. (not old men! *ewww*) Still, that said, I wasn't disappointed."
1,Just plain bad,"Wish they still made the foam TV brick from the 70's. Heck, while watching this movie I wanted to throw a REAL brick at my TV - at that rate, I wanted to throw anything I could pick up with two hands and just heave-ho! I also had the secret wish, while watching this with my partner, to strangle every character - how shallow can these guys get? Just SOOOO stupid.Perhaps I'm missing something; but then again, I'm not, because I didn't buy this piece of garbage - I just rented it."
3,O.K.,"Another story about a hustler. This one is intelligent, quite spiritual (the most ridiculous part in the movie), with golden heart (at least for some).He shares his life with two other gays in a spacy appartment. We get the chance to learn a lovestory (well, made up story) of one of his clients. And this part seemed to me the most interesting in the whole film.As I mentioned before, spirituality of X, the main character, can irritate. Everytime he repeated ""Father, forgive me"" or another preaching bullsh***, it felt very thin and fake. And the scene with Maria's statue hidden in X's wardrobe...??? Cheap.However, the plot makes sense and acting is also not bad. That's why 3 stars."
4,TB Watch,"The watch is beautiful! I have a TAG, but wanted a watch with a leather band without the high price. I don't have or like other jewelry. This watch is great, keeps perfect time. The band is unique. The only drawback is the placement of the date button. When putting the watch on, I sometimes push the button and change the date without realizing it."
5,Christmas Gift for husband,This watch is BEAUTIFUL. It works wonderfully. Looks great on the wrist. Perfect for relaxed style people. The picture does not do it justice. Moon phase is great addition. Leather band is hardy & soft. Goes well with the linen & silk and more casual Tommy Bahama life style.
1,Paris in the the Spring?,"What relation this book is to Paris is unknown. No direction, plot or sense - a bit like a comic book...No Thanks."
3,Nice quilt,"I bought this quilt because of the price. It wasn't exactly what I was looking for but I'm quite happy with it. My one issue with it is that after washing it once, some of the stitching is coming undone."
5,Fabulous workout shoes,These shoes offer so much support...I am so glad I purchased them. I will no doubt purchase a new pair when these wear out.
4,HOLIDAY BARBIE HALLMARK ORNAMENT,"TYPICAL BARBIE HALMARK ORNAMENT. NOT A LOT OF DETAIL. BUT MADE TO LAST. WILL HOLD UP TO YEARS OF USE, JUST LIKE PREVIOUS 10YRS."
5,Number one book I read,"This small book was one of the first of it's kind when I was first learning about my own personality disorder. Years later I was lucky enough to meet the editor, Lynn W who nows has ManyVoicesPress com that helps thousands each day find more answers. A great book to begin to understand trauma and it's effect on mankind."
4,"Great dryer, however, breaks down after a year","I bought this hair dryer one year ago and it is now starting to vibrate and something inside is rattling. The force of the dryer is also going out. Too bad, because this was a great dryer when it worked. I had a Sedu prior to this dryer and I would have to say that the performance was just as good, if not better, than the Sedu. I have long, thick hair and it dried it within 10 minutes.I will definitely be buying a different dryer."
2,Not as much as I had hoped for,"I purchased my previous BaByliss from my hairdresser. It worked wonderfully. Unfortunately it gave out on me after one year, but I loved it so much I opted to purchase another. At the hair dresser's it cost double what they were charging online so I was thrilled to find this one. However, the one I received from Amazon - same model - was not nearly as powerful as the one I purchased from my hairdresser. BIG disappointment. I'm inclined to buy another one from her and chalk this one up as a loss."
4,Fantastic blow dryer,I love this blow dryer. i placed my order on tuesday and received it on thursday. only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the blow dryer was supposed to come with a black leather case. no case came. other than that i will continue to do business with you!!!
5,Excellent,"This is the best hair dryer I've ever owned! I was very satisfied with my last one, which came from The Sharper Image about five years ago but this one is even better. Takes about 2 minutes to dry my medium length hair. The dryer is light weight too. It's worth every penny!"
5,"Very nice, good quality","Just what I was hoping for. These are good quality and just the right size.The shepherd is just under 3"" in length. The angel is 2.75"". The star is 2"" and the ginger bread man is ~2.25""."
5,Great for sensitive skin!,"Great lotion. I have very sensitive skin and this caused no irritation at all. Inexpensive as far as indoor tanning lotions go, which is a huge plus."
5,Teddy,"This is a great board book. It's a great read and talk about book. They learn textures and how things feel. It's beautifully illustrated, colorful and you don't have to worry about them ripping the pages. They will want to carry around with them all the time. Very cute. Great for special needs children also."
3,A bit more used than I thought,"When I odered it, it said used. One of the corners of the book was pretty rough, and it had some stickyness in one of the pages. A little more used than I thought."
5,I would pick Paradise over this one...,"...but this is still a great concert DVD. Mostly stuff from their most recent album ""Yes, Virginia"" and the live versions put the studio versions to shame. Definitely worth owning if you like the Dresden Dolls!"
5,excelent,Great band with a lot of power with incredibly just two performers. Mad World cover is simply outrageous.
1,Junk!!!!!,"This is a flimsy aluminum extrusion., If you plan on hanging anything heavier than a paper screen, find something else. The screws supplied are way too small. The track is also too narrow to fit a two door bypass. I doubt that anyone ever tried this hardware before they foisted it on Amazon's customers. Go to a hardware store where you can see what you are buying. Stay away from this junk"
5,Healing Your Self by Forgiving Miracles !!!,"No words can describe this experience. This is the one and only Course that humanity will take to heal and see a new world, where everyone is the same one and only, a brother in Christ."
1,No recomendaria,"Yo trate hacer los ejercicios, pero fue tan dificildado a que algunos se suponia que hacer cada 15 minutos,todo el dia!Porque es de New Age, no lo recomendaria."
4,Extremely Interesting,"These essays were very good, some of them were very moving. I found that this book explained the college essay process and was an easy read."
2,mediocre,"These essays are very individual and personal.If you're looking to write a college essay, it's going to be difficult to copy any of these ideas.It's been an OK read.I found that many of them just drew on cultural, presonal background more than anything else.One essay which I thought was fantastic.. was about the applicant writing about his passion for magic."
4,"Excellent quality, over priced","Excellent construction. No instructions included for connecting to camcorder or camera, which may confuse some novice users. Only issue is that the strap is over priced. Go for the black version that is lower priced (at time of this writing)."
1,Not worth the time to read,"I wouldn't recommend this book. The author's interpretations of various passages are just rehashes of the passages themselves. His explanation of Eccl. 10:10 ""If the axe is blunt for lack of sharpening..."" is have you ever tried to cut down a tree with a dull axe?The author is also into capital punishment for children. Over and over he says ""go to a baseball game.""If you're serious about studying Ecclesiastes this book won't help one bit."
1,Can never get the shoe tight enough,"These shoes would be so comfortable if they could be tightened. Let me explain, the big flap you see is the velcro part. And you simply place the flap onto the shoe. Sounds simple enough, but the problem is you can't tighten the velcro. The Velcro doesn't go through a hole/loop initially, so you can't pull on it and then set the velcro down. Even if you hold the shoe really tight and then drop the velcro down, it is still loose. So what I had to do was set the velcro down without my foot in it. Then I use a shoe horn to get into the shoe so the shoe will fit snug enough so you won't slip out of the shoe, otherwise, you feet will come out of the shoe. The problem with the simple fix of shoe horning my feet in is that the shoe has a tongue, and the tongue gets shoved down. So after getting into the shoe I have to dig out the tongue and pull it up.As for looks, even with velcro it can easily pass off as a comfortable dress shoe."
2,didn't work,My dad has bad feet and we were so hopeful that these would allow him to use his brace and have nice shoes. Not the shoes fault but we had to return them.
5,"Bought 2 to fit my 2001 Grand Am, ez install.","So both my back rear power windows stopped working, i assumed it was the window regulator due to a friend who had auto knowledge. So i called the repair shop to inquire how much it would be for part and labor to repair these both. They told me each one would cost $302.00 to repair, so $604.00 for both parts and labor. I was like holy crap im not paying that. So i went to youtube and watched some videos about installing these window regulators myself, since i figured if a mechanic can do it, i can do it. So with very little knowledge i replaced both back window regulators, was fairly simple with minimal tools, a socket set and a screwdriver is all you need. The install was cake and both regulators only cost me about $130. I recommend anyone to do this yourself, screw the repair shops who try to rip you off for such an easy job, only took me about an hour and half per window, and im sure someone who knows what they are doing could do it in much less time."
3,Ironic,"I have ordered every Le mans 24hrs dvd since 2002. I have all of them since the year 2002 as well as 1998 and the 1999 race. I must admit that the 2007 le mans dvd was shorter in length than the previous 5 dvd races. It is ironic because the 2007 le mans 24 hrs was reduced by an hour or two due to rain, the dvd goes through the race quickly and does not give detail information as the previous dvd's. Over all the race is exciting but the dvd should have been better!"
5,Great,"Very nice done, very good resolution and very complete information. A must for car racing fans."
1,very poor,"LeMans 2007 Official FilmAn absolutely useless dvd. 50% of the dvd is pre-race, with useless statements a la NASCAR (""our frito-lay buick ran good, and we hussled hard""). the driving sequences are way to brief to analyse driver errors, and some are cut off!!."
2,A Pretty Boring Anime,"Alba spends most of her time building plastic models. One day, after her Grandmother dies, she is kidnapped by a cross-dressing man. He takes her to a base where she becomes the pilot of a mecha called a Jinki. Alba fights to save humanity.This anime is pretty boring. I realized about 7 episodes into the series that all these battles that took place for no reason. There is no clear enemy. It's like a child playing with with toy soldiers. There is no point to anything that happens in this series. The good guys and bad guys have no goals or allegiances. It seems like they have a simple code: ""Wow! Another mecha, lets blow it up!"" They simply fight for the hell of it. The animation is average, the voice acting is pretty good, and the soundtrack is okay. Nothing important happens in this series. It just kinda exists. I can't recommend it. It's a serious bore."
3,Should be better for the price,"This cd case is outwardly attractive but has an irritating feature -- the lower zippered edge interferes with the turning of the pages. I'm not sure if I received a lemon that was stitched wrong or what, since this doesn't seem to bother most people, but I'm spoiled by the EZ Choice cases sold on eBay which are cheaper and better constructed -- at least you can turn the pages unimpeded! I ordered the Case Logic thinking it would be even better because it's more expensive, but that's not the case. The leather-like exterior does look better on a shelf than the EZ Choice fabric, and it seems a bit easier to slip the cds into the pockets of the Case Logic, but the awkward design of the lower zippered edge and the odd looking plastic loops that hold the pages together cancel out the good points."
2,What a Mistake,If you happen to live in NYC or another big city where discount or 99 cent stores exist you'll find similar storage books of all sizes for your CD's at a fraction of the cost. Since these storage books are all made in China of virtually the same type materials I recommend you start looking there. I began in a local Best Buy which turned out to be a worst buy and then purchased through Amazon where I still overpaid greatly. The book itself was as described by some reviewers ie. the zipper sticks when closed and the pages are very hard to rearrange. FORGET IT!
3,NOT a DVD Wallet,Don't market it as a dvd wallet... it isn't! There is NO place for title notes. We (the general public) are smart enough to know we can use it to house dvds if we choose not to store the title notes.
3,Read the reviews for the 336 capacity model,"This product has apparently changed recently. This is my first one, so I don't know all the features that are different, but the one I care about is the fast file at the front of the binder, which is no longer removable.If you read the reviews of the 336 capacity model, you'll find out about all sorts of other disappointments. I, thankfully, lacked those reviewers' same expectations. But I am sorry to see another corporate ""improvement"" benefiting no one but the corporation's bottom line."
4,Great Case but beware!!!,"This is a great carrying case. Its durable, insulated well, and doesn't break easily...but that doesn't mean it doesn't break. I used both sides of each sleeve. I definitely wouldn't suggest it because it does a number on the rings (which hold the sleeves together). I would reccommend this case but I suggest you only use one side of each cd page instead of both sides."
4,Good product,"This CD/DVD case was exactly what I was looking for, the outside of the case looks really nice and is very durable. The pages are really easy to flip and there are even extra spaces in the front cover for easy access. It's great!"
5,:),"Fast shipment, good product for a good price. All of our DVD's fit into this case with room to spare.... great space-saver!"
1,Not the same product as the image shows,"This product is a much lower quality than the original version that is pictured -- the Koskin is much thinner, the zipper pulltab is cloth, and the edges are not even Koskin... they are more like a plastic cloth; additionally , the stitching is brown instead of black, and (though it's not pictured otherwise) the handle doesn't have a nameplate like the original version had. This version seems much cheaper and doesn't really match the originals I bought a year ago. I do not recommend this product if you can find the originals."
5,Convenient size and well built,"I am very happy with this CD binder. Discs slip in easily, and organization is simple. Pages can be moved with only minor difficulty. The koskin has a nice profesional looking texture. There is a strong handle integrated into the outside of the spine to allow you to carry the binder conveniently. I have filled one up completely and notice it is a tad heavy and so I would not recommend a size larger than this 264-disc one.My only complaint is that the individual sleeves may be an eighth of an inch too narrow meaning you can't store ""fat"" CD liner notes in one. Nonetheless, the big benefit of getting rid of several hundred jewel cases far outweighs this 'small' issue."
2,Academic and dated,This text is not helpful to the reader who wishes to devise and estimate GARCH models. Moreover it provides no insight into the practical use of these models in the analyses of financial data. Much of the material appears to be lecture notes by an academic who has no idea of how to apply GARCH models. Particularly missing is any discussion of how to estimate the parameters of GARCH models.
3,Great smell but a bit dry,"We have tried them allWe love the Mustela smell and the product quality overallHowever, it is a bit dry and therefore comes short as compared to the other brands"
5,Inspection Sticker Place,Exactly as described and came right on time. Easy to install. Worked great on Spyder. This is great when your inspection sticker just won't stay on where placed by the dealer!
5,Visual Culture- Mirzoeff,The book is quite an interesting read and does a good job of covering key themes in this relatively new area.The author is -at times-very insightful.
1,Biased and Boring,"This book was exceptionally biased, and opinion based. Very little actual facts were used in the publication, which makes you wonder how it made it to the shelves. It is very outdated, and wastes an entire chapter on the situation in the Congo, which was completely off subject. The author tends to go on tangents and fails to ever truly get his point across. The chapter on photography was a serious let down, and focused on only two photographers who are amateur at best in regards to their talent. As a photographer, the chapter offended me greatly and failed to address the artistic aspects of photography. The book was more concerned about the sexual revolution of the 1970's than it was of Visual Culture."
1,Previous review was true,One of the four batteries wasn't charging. The other 3 lasted less than 30 minutes on my Wii remote control. Charger is OK.
1,"Factually challenged, agenda-driven history","Mr Palmer's ""work"" is a factually challenged, agenda-driven piece that cannot standup to common sense, much less proper historical analysis. His ""criticisms"" of Lee are such that one is left wondering what background in military history Mr Palmer possesses. As a consequence, Mr Palmer misunderstands the strategic situation facing a numerically weaker side, what a numercially inferior side MUST do to have a chance to win, and how Lee reacted under these circumstances. Without a doubt, Mr Palmer's most laughable assertion is that Lee went North in the Gettysburg campaign without any clear cut objectives. Clearly, Mr Palmer needs to do a lot more reading. I suggest two different books if one wants to gain a much better understanding of the Confederate strategic situation: these are Richard Tanner's ""Retreat to Vicotry?"" and Scott Bowden's ""Last Chance for Victory."""
1,This book is a joke,"Having read several books on Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia, and having a very high opinion of General Lee, I decided I should try and be objective by reading some books that were critical of General Lee. But I was very disappointed in Palmer's work. I was hoping to read some well researched criticism. What I got was a joke. Most of Palmer's arguments have serious flaws to them, any some don't make any sence at all. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,It is just okay,I wanted all of these songs but I wanted the singer to sound like Dinah Washington. She doesn't so I wasn't as satisfied with this album as I thought I would be. her voice is just okay and the CD is just okay.
4,Case Logic PDV-3 DVD Player Case,"I recently bought this case to use for a small DVD player with a 4"" screen. It fit perfectly except I can't fit all of the accesories in it. I tried several combinations and always had one accessory that wouldn't fit. I'm going to return this and try either the Case Logic PDV-2 or the PDV-1 case. These two are a little bit larger than the PDV-3. If you don't have that many accessories then the PDV-3 is perfect. Its very compact and has lots of padding for the dvd player."
2,Sea Life,"I was very disapointed in this book. I expected a lot of clip art of different sea creatures, but instead the book only has a few species in a lot of different sizes."
2,good potential,"the album had 2 pretty good songs and maybe 3 other so so songs. the rest were really not that great.the lead singer has an incredible voice as can be heard on the last track in which tonya sings God Bless the Child.i wish they would've done the whole song instead of fading away to the sound of some annoying automobile.though she has an incredible voice,the males in the band are pretty terrible at singing and sound like they're struggling a lot.at least their playing was pretty tight.i really hope to hear more of her singing in the next album and if male vocals are needed maybe they can have a guest appearance or something."
4,Great Album!,"This is a great album! Well written songs, especially for their ages at the time. Agreed that some male voices are a little weak but they make up for it on ""The New Authentic""(the last album). Fun record! Highly recommended!"
3,uncomfortable,This item is firm enough to be painful if you put much pressure on it. I also found the heavy suction-cup end to be awkward; it gets in the way if you choose not to actually stick it to anything.
3,Intellectually Dishonest,"This priest-professor-author attempts to explain the decline of the Catholic Church in the last thirty years. He finds plenty of villians to blame, but scrupulously and absurdly avoids the principle cause of this decline: the decisions and policies of the highest Church authorities. So in the end, the book comes off as intellectually dishonest in the extreme."
4,syndicating your irie feelings,"Sould Syndicate offers great music for the soul. It captures all of the good vibes that are present in the reggae beats. Soul Syndicate takes your mind for a vacation, specially with songs like New Vibrations, and Black Cinderella. This CD is a bridge to that irie feeling we all need to be in touch with."
1,How to review a toy you never received,"I imagine that this stroller would really be nice if I ever received it in the first place. I have notified you of this and received a single email about contacting some other vendor, who hasn't bothered to contact me. I consider Amazon responsible, that is who I purchased the item through, but as of this date no additional assistance."
1,Canon Power adapter,"This power adapter does not fit the Canon ZR10 camera. If you have that type of camera do not buy this product because it will NOT WORK! And like me, you will have to pay for the shipping to your house and to send it back again."
1,Anchovy Paste in a Can,"When you open the tins, it LOOKS like there are anchovy fillets inside, but you'd need to be a neurosurgeon to extract an identifiable fillet. They're all mushy, and it's more like a glob of anchovy paste surrounded with oil than actual individual anchovies."
2,"Pasty, mushy","The flavor is fine, but they have the consistency of paste, and you can't seperate the fillets - they fall apart. Not recommended."
3,fish,So far very good except for 2 tins that when opened were somewhat rancid and had a strong smell. Maybe from shipping damage. The others are fine and I will buy again.

3,Eddy Murphy shows off,"Well, this is an average comedy when we look at it by it's jokes. But what makes it more appealing to it's contentors, is Eddy Murphy's huge role. He still is a funny guy. But what I value most here is the description of loneliness. I mean, this movie goes right in the bone with the problems that people might have with their self-esteem, social realtionships or overwight. All of which are daily issues to many many people out there. Michael Stipe said it best: ""Everybody Hurts"". Very funny, and very serious film."
5,eddie deserves two oscars,not only with the many characters that he pulled off but his main character being so solid.this film was funny and sad all at once.it deals with many issues that always subtly or openly crop up in eddie films.i loved the richard simmons spoof.he is a great actor and more than just a funny man.
5,The Nutty Professor,"For Professor Sherman Klump, being the big man on campus wasn't all it's cracked up to be. His body was disproportionate. His family was dysfunctional. And his love life was disastrous. Having tried everything--diets, exercise and weight loss experts--in an unsuccessful attempt to shed some of his 400 pounds, Sherman Klump invents a revolutionary fat gene formula. Testing it on himself, he discovers he's no longer the man he used to be; in fact, he's only half the man he used to be. This is a must see. If if you have not seen it than you should. Eddie Murphy is so funny in this movie. If you like it then you should see the Nutty Professor II: The Klumps."
4,A Real Showcase For Eddie Murphy,"Eddie Murphy at the dinner table playing every character but the kid is one of the funniest scenes I remember from any 1990s comedy. But don't play this DVD to your young kids.His humor is very crude and nasty in the film - sometimes too much so, especially for another of these questionable PG-13 ratings - to give this a ""5"" but it does have a ton of laughs, courtesy of Murphy. Eddie is remarkable as all these characters. I believe he plays seven in all. This is probably his biggest 'showcase' ever on film, demonstrating his comedic talents.Even though this has a childlike-romance-type feel to it, and a nice message about bias against fat people, it's certainly not ""family fare."" This is a LONG way away from the original Jerry Lewis movie.Still....for adults, this movie provides a ton of laughs."
4,Eddie at his best,Eddie Murphy is definitely one of the undisputed kings of comedy. He's so hilarious. He's definitely phenomenal. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR really is a good movie. The scene with Dave Chapelle in da club is real hilarious esp when Eddie went back to show him who has been the game for long.
5,The FUNNIEST movie I have ever seen!!!,"Eddie Murphy was wonderful, as always, as Sherman Klump, the Nutty Professor. The movie was so hilarious and very funny. My stomach almost ached with laughter. This movie is truly the funniest movie ever. Comedy at it's finest!"
3,A very good remake/retake of the Jerry Lewis classic.,"Eddie Murphy takes the classic Jerry Lewis film and brings it up to date Murphy style. His characterizations of Sherman Klump and members of the Klump family are priceless. Nobody does this like Eddie Murphy!When the film began playing in theaters there was much ado about Eddie's character being obese and the fat jokes being offensive to those overweight. I don't see what all the hoopla was all about. The script handles all the overweight issue with balance and in the end Sherman realizes it's alright to be who you are so long as you are happy.It was nice to see Jerry Lewis was involved in the production. This is one DVD that should be a great addition to anyone's comedy collection, especially if you like Eddie Murphy and Jerry Lewis."
3,Is fat funny?,"What a funny movie! I'm not usually an Eddie Murphy fan but this movie was hilarious! Murphy was hilarious both as the professor and Buddie Love. I loved the message in the movie about self-acceptance but it's sort of annoying to see an obese person portrayed as insecure. I would love too see a movie with a secure, well-adjusted overweight person. It takes a radical transformation for Sherman Klump too realize that he should accept himself the way he is. While this is certainly a humourous way for him too accept himself it is very frustrating too obese people."
1,Isn't It Illegal To Make Movies This Bad?,"Eddie Murphy could have done a much better job in terms of picking a movie to star in. All this movie does is put down overweight people, make African-American people look like we have no table manners, and wastes your money. Folks, I think they're coming out with another Rambo."
3,It's ok,its ok but it's not completly good it has some hilairious parts but the proffesers family definetly has horrible manners. if you are trying to teach your child respect this isnt the movie to watch.
1,Vulgar bathroom humor.,"The Nutty Professor is complete trash! Eddie Murphy is not that funny, don't understand why people thinks he's brilliant. Jada Pinkett Smith is even worse, terrible actress and she is just famous because of her husband. I couldn't find anything fresh about this remake, don't watch this pathetic film."
2,Expected More from Eddie Murphy,"If you enjoy clich'-jokes, perhaps you will enjoy this film more. I was hoping for more of the characterization from Saturday-Night -Live type skits where Murphy disguised himself, immersed himself, completely into a new person. This was flat, fine for a summer movie with no expections. The special effects helped the rating up to 2. GREAT MURPHY FILMS are ""Coming To America"", ""BEVERLY HILLS COP series"", ""BOOMERANG"", ""48-HOURS"", and ""The Distinguished Gentleman."""
5,Great Movie!,"This is a great movie, including Buddy Love, he is so funny, but Reggie Warrington, what an idiot, i'm glad Buddy beat the crap out of Reggie, but the Klump family is funny too, including that they keep farting. I give it 5 stars. WARNING: May contain farting."
5,Good/Great Quality!,"This video is very excellent quality ,especially for the next to nothing price.Even w/ shipping cost,cant beat the price or quality. Will order again.Thanks"
5,Drama and laugh!!,this movie demonstrates how exceptionaly talented Eddie Murphy is as a comedian!!he impersonates 6 characters!!!!I dont buy any comedy movies but this one is an exception!!this movie not only has laughs but has some drama blended in!!go buy it highly recommended!!!
3,OK - but too many options,"The book shows you how to use different types of calculators to determine time value of money. If you only have one of those calculators, the others are useless.I recommend using your calculator's manual and learn from it rather than buying this expensive useless book. Of course, you will still need to understand the basics of money and how it accumulates (or not) as a function of time."
4,Handy little pocket book,"I have been in telecommunications for over 8 years, and carry this book around with me. The information in this book has helped me more times than I can remember. I definately recommend it."
4,Easy to Hide Things,"I have a 4 and 2 year old and although I wish they wouldn't trample through my minivan like it was a playroom, sometimes it just works out that way. I keep the Caselogic on my directional next to the steering wheel and they never see it. It's a very hand and convenient place to store my wireless headset and my phone- I'd highly recommend this item and you can't beat the price!"
2,No use for it,It seems like a good idea but I just simply found no good use for it. I didn't want it in my air vent or anywhere else. It just got in the way.
5,Baby yarn,"Could not find the color anywhere except amazon, had already started an afgan with this color and ran out. so pleased that I could finish the baby afgan with the correct color"
3,Twenty two minutes with the Patriots,"If you are a fan of the New England Patriots and wish to have a complete narrative from their first Super Bowl win in 2002 and their second in 2004, as crafted by the great photographers and editors at NFL Films, then this disc might be for you. Be aware, however that it is less than half an hour long. Acheving this running time is easy since only games which the Patriots won are presented. There are no menus, or extra features. There is a tasteful introduction sequence and a well written narration read with classic NFL Films bravado. If nothing else, this video would set-up the 2004 video nicely."
4,Decent and useful,"Its not bad and serves its purpose of storing cds just fine, however, it does feel a little flimsy and when its on sale, it is worth buying."
2,Cheap Binder,I have other large wallets that have 3 ring binders. All of the sheets in this one are permantantly locked in place. Try keeping 208 CDs organized when you can't reorder or insert a blank one in the middle.
1,Pens are not the same,"I loved the black Bic Atlantis pens and wanted more. I ordered them from Amazon. They are not the same pen in the picture. They are nothing like the ""old"" pens. They seem to have been cheapened. They do not write fluidly like the old ones. They seem to be a fine point rather than medium point. They no longer have the nice soft grip on the bottom. I'm putting them in the closet and trying to find the ""old"" Bic Atlantis pens I loved."
1,Not all all what I ordered,"The pens I received were nothing like those pictured. The box had obviously been opened and filled with pens other than those originally in the box. Apparently I am not the only one to have this problem--do yourself a favor, and buy these somewhere else."
2,Be careful of what you are ordering!,"Bic Atlantis ""Super Smooth"" - great pen; it's my favorite;Bic Atlantis ""Easy Glide"" - poor quality, feels cheap, ink smears - would not buy it."
2,"Not as shown in the picture (new, lower quality version)!","I have been a big fan of the original BIC Atlantis pens for years. Besides having a comfortable, classic shape, they were some of the only pens in their price range that wrote nearly flawlessly with no inconsistencies or smudges. Unfortunately, BIC seems to have replaced them with a newer, much lower quality version that bears little resemblance to the original other than the shape. The quality is noticeably poorer, with frequent sputters and smudges. The pen also looks worse, with a brightly colored body and white grip instead of the original transparent body.I was particularly frustrated with my Amazon purchase because the advertised picture clearly shows the original BIC Atlantis, but what you receive is the new poor-quality version. Shameless case of bait and switch!"
1,Old look deceiving,"I bought a box of the Atlantis pens because the picture on the box is of the old version - an excellent pen. I was disappointed /frustrated when I received a box of the ""new,"" leaky pens. They await their fate: the garbage can."
2,Owful,This item does not have enough space for your car documents unless if you have to cut your car certificate in two.
2,You get what you pay for,"This wallet is made with very cheap materials. The plastic sticks together on hot days and it will probably fall apart before too long.Its an okay way to keep the insurance card and registration handy for now, but if you have to pull it out on a regular basis like me, I would recommend getting something more durable."
2,Caselogic ARC-1 Registration Wallet,"I agree with another review that the pockets are really sticky. When you put it in your glove compartment, it makes the whole thing stick even more. I live in NY and our insurance cards are more rectangular and not square so it doesn't fit in this case unless you fold it. Also our registration cards are glossy and the ink will smear on the inside of the plastic leaving a copy of the card on it. I think if your registration cards are just plain paper it will be fine."
4,Super. Very Neat.,Super. Very Neat. Even for Traffic Cop it is very impressive and quick to find and present.
5,Suprisingly Tasty...A++ item,"Im gald I tried this I normally would not, it is really good. I admit I tried it because of the good reviews, raspberry is not my thing yet my family loved it.It's great with mixed cream cheese and eaten with pretzles, or crackers :) I also enjoyed it on grilled chicken, and pork. I encourage you to go wild and put it on whatever you please it works well with so many different things.It manages to be spicy and sweet just the right mix of both amazing. In fact I have enjoyed it alone as well...just abit on a spoon its that good. I will be using this again.Try It (-_-)"
3,Unusual and pretty tasty,"A very unusual and tasty sauce.We tried it on chicken and poured over goat cheese and it was good. It's got a very original, spicy, sweet, berry flavor that is hard to describe.A few family members thought it was too sweet, but over all it got a thumbs up."
4,Good balance of sweet smoke and spice,"While there are seeds, they are not as hard as expected, still I would like to see a seedless version.The Razzmatazz Margarita recipe was a bit much for me, this sauce has very strong flavors that can be a bit overwhelming when not held in check with the rest of the dish. The other recipes available here [...] are all great.The sauce pairs extremely well with chocolate and red wine flavors.For a simple gourmet addition to holiday or pregame snacks, pour a little of the sauce over a block of cream cheese and let guests spread on Triscuit crackers."
2,Much too sweet,"I just loved my first taste - sweet, smoky, spicy. A very addictive combination of flavors. I thought I'd try it in a stir fry and I found it to be much too sweet and overpowering. The main ingredient is sugar and it seems like the heat comes from the jalapenos and the smokiness from the chipotle. I really didn't mind the raspberry seeds. This sauce isn't really to my liking and I can't see myself using it for cooked dishes because I think it will mask and overpower any other flavors.Taste is a personal thing and I can imagine many others liking it but it's not for me."
4,great complement to the right dish,"The good:I tried the pork tenderloin recipe included on the bottle tag and my husband and I just loved it. It was a great mix of flavors - the combination of rosemary, thyme, and raspberry chipotle were amazing. Not overly sweet or hot/spicy, and definitely not boring, either. I'll be adding it to our regular rotation of dinners.It was also wonderful with a pepper jack risotto cake, and it's pretty good on a cracker with cream cheese.The not so good:Without other flavors to mix with, it tasted a bit strong for us. It was not great with plain rice or chicken that had only been seasoned with salt and pepper.Bottom line:With the right recipe, it really adds an interesting dimension and great flavor."
3,"I like the taste, but it is seedy.","Good flavor - sweet and hot and smokey. It is certainly made from real raspberries, as there are a TON of seeds in this, almost enough to detract from my enjoyment of it.I like it as a dipping sauce for roast or grilled pork or chicken - especially left over cold meat."
4,I was very pleasantly surprised,"I do not like raspberries. I requested this more for the raspberry-loving members of my family, but much to my surprise, found this sauce to be quite addictive. We are still experimenting with different combos of foods (pork, beef, chicken, turkey --- all wonderful) and even some different condiments (an accidental mixing of this sauce with mustard was a huge hit at our superbowl party). The pleasantly controlled heat does not overwhelm the flavor, nor does one feel dominated by the sweetness of the berries. It is strong enough so that a little bit goes a long long way. We will be sure to get more when this bottle runs out!"
4,"A Great Ingredient, but Definitely More Sweet than Heat","The Fischer & Wieser Razzpotle sauce is an interesting and versatile ingredient, great for marinating meat, creating salad dressings, or making snack dip.Don't be afraid of the chipotle portion of the name - it's vastly overshadowed by the sweetness of the raspberry. For that reason, I recommend using it with saltier meats like pork and beef versus chicken or fish. There's even a great pork tenderloin recipe on the bottle.Mixed with a strong vinegar, it makes a great salad dressing - the chipotle adds a little extra surprise vs. your everyday raspberry vinaigrette without being overpowering.You can also use it as flavor for a snack dip. Mixed with a smooth cheese, the sauce delivers a smoky aftertaste on top of the sweet and spicy layers."
5,Sweet and Spicy!,"This is a perfect combination of sweet and spicy. It has some kick, but not enough heat to make it unpleasant and the raspberry adds the perfect hint of sweetness.The bottle contains a recipe for the use of the sauce on a pork loin. I tried that with the family and it was a hit. It wasn't too spicy for my 6 year old, he really liked it. I also poured some over a block of cream cheese and served it with crackers at a Super Bowl party, everyone (adults and children) really enjoyed it. My husband has been using it in addition to a mayonnaise on his turkey or chicken sandwiches. I received one bottle and I still have it, a little goes a long way.It's a versatile sauce and I will be purchasing more for the upcoming BBQ season.Cherise Everhard, March 2009"
2,Need to strain the seeds; more sweet than spicy,"First and foremost, I agree with the reviewer that said this sauce needs to be strained to be truly useful. The flavor is okay, although I personally would prefer more spicy chipotle in the balance. I will probably add some powdered chipotle seasoning to the remainder of this bottle. Also, I think it's pretty darn pricey, more than I would be willing to pay."
4,Sweet and spicy. And seedy.,"This sauce is a wonderful blend of sweet and spicy. It's quite good on turkey sandwiches or chicken quesadillas.But I really don't like having the raspberry seeds in the sauce. They're just a little too much ""texture"" for a sauce."
5,And it's so tasty too!,"We tried this sauce in several ways and were very impressed. Combined with balsamic vinegar, it makes a zesty restaurant style dressing with plenty of snap.The flavor is strong but not like a steak sauce. The raspberry cuts the spicy edge nicely, creating a sweet-and-sour type of flavor with a spicy edge of chipotle.Another kitchen experiment was roast chicken breast and broccoli, both glazed with the sauce. It may have been a little too much for the broccoli -- being a thin mixture it is easily absorbed, like soy sauce. But it really made the always challenging chicken breasts quite enjoyable. We're always looking for something to dress up chicken breasts. I also poured some over white rice and used sparingly, it was a fun taste.This is the sort of all-purpose sauce you'll want to keep handy to bring a gourmet restaurant taste to practically any entree, especially when you're getting in a rut and want to try something new."
3,Decent but not great,"I am not a fan of sweet tasting sauces, so this was an immediate turn off. I did not expect it to be quite so sweet. It also contains seeds which I was not expecting. My husband like it a little more than I did, but it is too much like syrup to be something we would enjoy using often, if ever again. The sauce is also a bit watery, not as thick as one would hope so it actually falls off instead of remaining on the meat.If you like sweet sauces and don't mind seeds, then you'll probably enjoy this sauce quite a bit. If you are looking for something more spicey or salty, then look elsewhere."
5,"Awesome, versatile sauce....","This was our first experience with Razzpotle, and it was absolutely delicious. We first tried it in our meatloaf, which gave it a sweet flavor with a slight kick, which even our kids loved. It's also great for burgers on the grill, and mixed with a little oil, makes an awesome salad dressing. It's rare to come across a sauce this versatile and delicious, and for that it gets 5 stars all-around."
4,Versatile product,"I like the flavor and texture of this product. Its also an extremely versatile item in the kitchen for meats and appetizers. I found that is was particularly good on pork chops, where the raspberry flavor really complemented the meat and brightened up the flavor. I thought it was even more fun to use it as an appetizer - spread over a thin layer of cream cheese on a dinner or serving plate (not too thick of a cream cheese layer) with a side of pretzels or wheat thins. I couldnt stop eating it. I think the price could be a tiny bit lower, but I do think its worth it. Quality product."
2,"Phew, too much!","If I had to use one word to sum up this product, it would be the following:""Overwhelming""The sauce is thick, which is good for marinating or spreading on a burger or ribs or what have you, but it's so rich and sweet that it really dominates the flavor of whatever it is that you put it on. Furthermore, the mixture is such that when grilling with it, the sauce caramelizes and chars if the heat is too intense. That's a whole different mess. If you like really sweet heavy sauces this is for you, but I'll pass on using this again."
3,great for stir frys!,"Okay, this is a great sauce to use for stir frys especially with beef and lamb. The sauce has a 'smoky' taste and hence I didnt think it worked that well for chicken and delicate fish. Talk about saving time for a quick meal - we love it. Sometimes, we marinate the meat over night and that makes the meat taste a lot more smokey and flavorful - especially for a non-expensive cut of meat, which we all face in our food budget!it has a very low sodium count of 3% and has not 'bad' ingredients like high frutose sugar, which I just found out that heinz ketchup has - eeeek. We also found a little goes a long way."
2,A very average rasberry chipotle,"If you've never tried a raspberry chipotle before this sauce will likely blow your mind and jam your radar (or at the least tickle your taste buds)! But once the initial awe of the raspberry and chipotle combination subsides and you begin to try other brands, you will quickly realize that this Razzpotle is VERY AVERAGE. I have tried at least 6 different raspberry-chipotle brands and the best one by far isD.L. Jardine's Buckin' Berry Rasberry Chipotle Sauce. The Buckin' Berry is thicker and the Razzpotle is quite liquidy. The Buckin' Berry has way more flavor and kick!"
4,Add chipotle powder and you've got a winner.,"For me the sauce was more sweet than chipotle, so I added a little chipotle powder to the dish and it was just perfect. The sauce does come with seeds so buyer beware. The sauce has no preservatives so once you open the bottle you'll need to use rather quickly, it will not keep forever even though refrigerated.I actually used the sauce in the crockpot with porkchops. I sprinkled the chops with a chipotle powder and cracked pepper, then added onions and the raspberry chipotle sauce. I let it cook 4-5 hours and it was absolutely delicious. The chipotle powder and the pepper helped cut the ""sweet"" of the sauce. For me it's just way too sweet to stand alone.I've seen some of the reviews that the seeds were bothersome to some but after cooking in the slow cooker for several hours the seeds were softened to the point that it was not an issue for me. Perhaps that will help the others who had a problem with the seeds. There are a lot of them."
5,smoky hot deliciousness!,"Yum....that pretty much sums it up...on cream cheese as an appetizer this would be awesome as it has a taste like a pepper jam, but the way that I used it first was by adding 1 part chipotle sauce to 1 part balsamic to dress up a spinach salad with raspberries, blackberries & blueberries. Delicious! Next on the got to try is coating a little on top of a chicken breast and grilling it up. It is just the right sweetness with the smoky hot (but not too hot) taste of chipotle. A very nice, versatile little bottle to have on hand in the kitchen. I'll definitely be using this often in the kitchen to give my dishes a little kick.Definitely would recommend!"
4,"TASTY AND VERSATILE, BUT TOO MUCH SUGAR!","I picked up a bottle of this versatile sauce because I love Chipotle peppers! The sauce works well as a marinade for meats and fish and has some interesting uses such as adding to cream cheese for a dip and adding to balsamic vinegar for a salad dressing. If I had one problem with this sauce, it's that it has 9 grams of sugar per serving(per tablespoon)! That's a lot of sugar, but if this is used in moderation, it does add some zip to your proteins!"
4,Worked Well in a Slow Cooker,"I tried this in my slow cooker for a ""melting pot luck"" to celebrate the inauguration of Barack Obama. I chopped about 3/4 of onion, laid it on the bottom of the pot, layered riblets on top, and then covered it all with an entire bottle of sauce. Left it on low and ten hours later brought it to the party. It seemed pretty good to me, but the proof was in the empty serving platter. I also took a little glance at the stacked used plates and didn't see any discarded riblets! So, it was a success. The sauce itself is a great color and looks very fresh. I'm not a fan of ""hot"" foods and this has a little kick but nothing over the top."
3,Good sauce,"I'm afraid we did not use the sauce as much, despite the raving reviews. We just never had the occasion to use it on the type of food we were cooking. We didn't think it would go well with anything other than the red meats. We used it once and it has a distinct taste with the tartness of rasberry adding a new flavor."
5,A treat everyone loves.....,"The Fischer & Wieser roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce is one of those hard to find combinations - a snack that is very tasty, pleasing to all and on top of that very easy and simple to prepare. Just pour over a brick of cream cheese and serve with your favorite snack crackers. It will disappear quickly."
4,Yummy!,"We were doubtful at first about the raspberry aspect of this, but we put it on some pork tenderloin and it was yummy! We will use it again."
3,"Makes a good marinade, just a little too smoky for my tastes.","Fischer & Wieser Razzpotle sauce tastes exactly like the item's description; it's sweet, (slightly) spicy, and (a bit too) smoky. I'm always on the lookout for something new to marinade my chicken dinners in, and thought I would give Razzpotle sauce a shot (a marinade was the only thing I planned to use it for). For the most part it works quite well as a marinade. I left some chicken breast in the fridge with the Razzpotle sauce overnight and, when cooked, the chicken had a nice, complex flavor. It was predominately sweet, and just slightly spicy (so if you don't like very spicy foods there is no worry), however, it left a fairly strong smoky aftertaste that I was not fond of.As a side note: All of the ingredients are natural, which is nice.All in all... If you don't mind a smoky flavor than I'm sure you'll appreciate the uniqueness of this Chipotle sauce."
4,"Sweet, smoky, with a little heat - very nice!","Though I've tried many ""hot sauces"" over the past decade or two, this was only my second excursion into the sweet but hot variety of products. The first, Robert Rothschild Farm Roasted Pineapple & Habanero Dip (not for sale yet on Amazon) is extraordinary. This product, Fischer & Wieser Razzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, is almost as good.I place this product one star down from perfection because to my taste the heat is a tiny bit overwhelmed by the raspberry sweetness, and also because the raspberry seeds can on occasion become an annoyance. But this is still a great product to serve on a cracker by itself, on a cracker with cream cheese, or use as an enhancement to any number of chicken, beef, or pork dishes. I'm very happy that I got to sample a bottle."
4,Unique sweet & spicy condiment,"I've never tasted anything quite like this. It's sweet, smokey, and spicy. The raspberry flavor is quite strong. The chipotle sneaks up on you.I have drizzled it on chocolate as well as cream cheese on crackers. It is very tasty. However, the sauce is quite distinctive so it tends to overpower other flavors.I'm a vegetarian and plan to try it when cooking. But I also plan to use only a small amount!"
3,it's ok,"This sauce has a nice sweet zip to it, but it's not anything to write home about. Goes good as a marinade or on wings."
1,not good at all,"I tried this out on a number of people with varying tastes ranging from those who prefer sweet to spicy barbecue sauces. Nobody liked it at all, and nobody would give it another shot. With that said, I'll stick to masterpiece and doctor it up."
4,Surprisingly tasty,"I made garlic meatballs and used this as a glaze. It adds an interesting note to beef, have not tried with chicken. It is sweetly raspberry and chipotle just as described. I wouldn't use it as a dipping sauce as there is both a bit too strong in sweetness and pepper flavor, but its perfect used IN a dish or as a marinade to add a special touch."
3,Sweets for the sweet!,"I tried this sauce several ways. On a turkey sandwich, on crackers, with cream cheese.Out of the bottle, it seems great. It smells terrific. On foods, however, it just didn't work for me. It is like a very thin raspberry jam with a hint of smokey heat that is completely overwhelmed by the sweetness of the sauce. For those of you who like sweet dressings, like poppyseed and catalina, this may go over well. I found it to be cloying and runny.On the plus side, it does have a strong fresh raspberry taste, so I think there is a good base here. It was just too sweet and too runny for me.Sean P. Logue, 2009"
4,Raspberry What?,"That was my initial reaction, at least, to two food types that seemed to have no business getting together. I was wrong. This product is very tasty, and a bit zesty-spicy. I tried it three ways: (1) as a salad dressing (a 1:1 mix with balsamic vinegar as suggested in the little recipe pamphlet attached to the bottle), (2) as a topping on baked pork chops, and (3) poured over cream cheese and spread on crackers as an hors d'oeuvre. All three were quite good - I liked the cream cheese spread the best, and the dressing the least because it was the spiciest of the three. The roasted raspberry flavor predominates this sauce, and that's fine with me - it has a very fresh fruity flavor. Is it worth the price (over $8 for a 20-ounce bottle)? Well, that's debatable, but I have to say it impressed me, and I'm looking forward to using it in other more creative ways."
4,Very interesting flavor - raspberry not too overwhelming,"I was not sure what to expect since raspberries can be very potent and this sauce came with visible seeds. However, it is a pleasant mix of sweet and spicy. Maybe a tad too spicy for my kiddos, but just a tad - definitely could be cooled with some careful pairings. We tried it on pork loin (applied after pan searing before placing it in the oven) and it was great - not too strong and I didn't need too much (it's 40 cal, 0g fat per tablespoon, so it is light enough). It makes a very interesting salad dressing if you dilute it with some balsamic or otherwise flavored vinegar. I liked it paired in a salad with something to bring out the sweet and just leave a hint of the chipotle - my picks are mandarin oranges and dried cranberries - but I'm probably alone there. While I usually prefer to make my own - it's a good choice for quick meals, and I would recommend it. At the same time, it does have a bit more bite than I'd like."
5,Raspberry Chipolte,This Raspberry Chipolte is the best. I use it on cream cheese with crackers. Also on salmon on the barbeque. Everyone loves it. Have been buying it for years at Costco but they don't have it anymore.
5,Simply addictive,"We use it as a dip. Pour it over a room temp block of cream cheese and dig in with a cracker. If the Chipotle is too hot, take more cream cheese; or more sauce for more tang.Then go buy more because it won't last long."
4,"Fruity, Spicy, Delicious","Raspberry Chiptole? Sign me up! I've been waiting to do this review until I really got into this sauce and I find myself using it more than I ever expected. I treat it like a lean meat flavor enhancer and use it on certain things. Mind you, expecting this to work on hamburgers or veal is expecting too much. This fruity sweet sauce has a slow burn from the chipotle. I am a spice nut and I didn't find this too spicy at all - mind you, I have no problems with jalapeños or habaneros or fiery BBQ sauces, so if you cant take most spices, you might find this to have a bit more heat than you expect. I recommend this to marinade chicken in or slather on pork chops."
1,missing expiration dates,"Why are the expiration dates not on this product? The label reads ""best if used by date on bottle"" and there is nothing but a lot number. The local Costco, (after my amazon purchase), decided to re-stock this item and it clearly had exp. date stamped on the bottle neck. As I compared my amazon purchase with the 02/12 exp. Costco purchase, I noticed a clear difference in the color and clarity of the product. This leads me to believe someone is removing exp. dates and selling old product. Has anyone else noticed this discrepancy? I will never buy a food product from Aamazon again!"
3,Sweet Experience,"This sauce is very sweet and tastes very similar to sweet and sour sauce.This is a matter of personal taste. It's a bit too sweet for my liking. I've tried it on chicken, steak, and peaches.I've also added some to pizza and my homemade tomato sauce, but in every trial of this product have found it overly sweet for my own palate. First on it's list of ingredients is sugar, unsurprisingly. The second is raspberries.I didn't find it spicy or very hot, there is a slight smokey flavor under all the sweetness.If you have a ""sweet tooth"", you'll probably like this.Since this is a matter of personal preference, I can't say ""buy it."" And I can't really recommend this to friend who are partial to sweetness, as there are so many cheaper seasonings."
4,Razzpotle: Raspberry that bites back,"Taken alone Razzpotle has quite a kick. It has comes across as having a light fruit flavor that is followed by a fairly powerful burst of spice. Though not as hot as Tabasco or Lousiana hot sauce, it nevertheless lets you know you've embarked on a unique taste sensation. I've had hot curry (number 8), and I'd say that Razzpotle scores about a 6 on the spiciness scale (is there a scale of spicyness? :-)I have tried Razzpotle over creamed cheese as a dip for crackers (extra good, and my favorite use so far). I also tried it on omlets (good, but not great), and as a topping for quesadillas, also a good option. My wife likes it even more than I do - she's more of a fan of spicy food than me, but Razzpotle was a hit at our house.If you like food with a kick, then Razzpotle is probably for you. I'm sure it would be good as a topper for a variety of foods, but I still like the dip the best, and normally I don't much care for spicy foods.I hope this was helpful."
4,"Great, different taste for dinner","I was kind of leary of trying this sauce because I am not really a fan of ""fruity"" flavors, but I found that I really loved the taste.It is is perfect blend of sweet/sour and has a kick of spice.I highly recommend it, especially if you are tired of the same old flavors."
5,Lots of flavor,"After reading some of the reviews here, I expected this sauce to be sweeter and more syrupy. Although you definitely taste the raspberries, the peppers and smokey flavor also come through, creating an interesting taste experience.The raspberry chipotle sauce goes well with meats (we tried beef and pork). Just a little sauce adds a lot of flavor. I haven't tried it as a marinade (yet) but I think that it would make a delicious marinade for grilled meats.One of the suggested recipes is to pour the sauce over cream cheese and eat as a dip with crackers. I tried this with bagel chips, and it was great. The cream cheese has a cooling effect on the peppers, without competing with the flavor of the sauce.I enjoyed trying this sauce, and I will be buying additional bottles so I can try new recipes."
5,Razpotle Sauce,Best sauce ever! Perfect over cream cheese with Triscuits or Wheat Thins. You will love it!
5,Excellent sauce!,I was put on by a brother in law and have used the gift he gave us on pork spare ribs several times. Now I am giving this sauce as Christmas presents after people have requested it having eaten spare ribs laced with it all summer. Amazon has the best price and size that I liked better than the manufacturer's site.
4,Good ... with BBQ sauce?!,"I have never had chipotle sauce before this and I was a little wary. I tasted it - straight from the bottle - and I liked the taste. I was not sure though whether I would like it so much in big doses - like after slathering it all over my beef or chicken.So I did what any good coward would do (I think...). I mixed a nice big helping in with BBQ sauce (I used Kraft original recipe), slathered that all over my chicken, ""oven BBQed"" the whole thing and ... I loved it!So happy experimenting."
3,Tasty but much sweeter than expected....,"The sweetness of this sauce limits its usefulness. It has a nice flavor but it overwhelmed the pork tenderloin I paired it with. In the future I will use it as an ingredient in sauces and marinades rather than on its own.I was expecting more balance between the chipotle and raspberry. The berry, however, over dominates the pepper. The sauce could almost go on ice cream. It's that sweet.So, if you've got a sweet tooth that makes you crave sweet entrees, this sauce may be for you. If not, you may wish to demote to just another ingredient."
4,mona lisa,This has a bold and fresh taste. Can be used many ways to create great dishes. Very versitle and a good item to have in your Kitchen. I recommend this product.
5,"Fast,very good service",Cheap fast and very good My kid loves it sence he just started his collection on Godzilla great Service looking for more action figures
5,Jet Jaguar,"Once again I purchased this Jet Jaguar for my grandchildren, they collect them. This one is very colorful and well made. They love them."
5,Godzilla action figure,It's great to be able to find these action figures as we cannot find them locally. My son and his friends have plans to make movies this summer.
1,The Player Doesn't Fit Into the Case,"I bought both the Panasonic DVD player and this case that is paired with it for a low, low price. The DVD player is about 1 inch too big for the case. The case doesn't close with the player in it. Since I can't find dimensions on any of the cases, I don't know which one is supposed to fit the DVD player.Don't buy the case."
2,Strange beginning,"Very predictable. I too had to force myself through the first few pages. It was obvious someone was going to die and the doll would be the cause of it. The way the story is just left hanging is bad too. You wonder what happened to the little girl in the story who kept the doll. Would she ""kill"" again? Maybe there'll be mention of her later on in the rest of the Blackstone Chronicles. --NA"
3,The Chronicles get off to a rocky start,"I was expecting much more from this first tale in the Blackstone Chronicles. The plot was entirely too predictable, and the characters (save for a few) were shallow and boring. I honestly did not find this tale terrifying in any way. However, this story does set the stage for the next installments, and definitely made me want to read the next one. As dull as it may be, it is essential for the entire scope of the Chronicles."
5,"Well, *I* didn't find this book predictable or not scary...","I read the reviews of this book before I read it, and unfortunately, most of the reviews said it was ""not scary"", ""predictable"", and ""unoriginal"". Well, listen up, ya bunch of pea brains! I found this to be pretty scary indeed, very original, and not once did I have any idea of what was going to happen. Dolls creep me out, and little children who love them--obsessively--creep me out even more. This book, for me, at least, was very creepy. I am currently reading Part 2 of The Blackstone Chronicles, Twist of Fate: The Locket. So far, it is somewhat quiet, but then again, this fragile layer of ice could start breaking at any time..."
2,This was not what i was looking for,This book was not what I was looking for. I did not read it and I didn't give it away. It is on my bookshelf. Its a medical book. Nothing really to do with accounting at all but this book came up when I searched for accounting novels. I don't recommend it.
4,Rebounding to Better Health,The book was very informative and easy to read. It gave very helpful information in obtaining results. I especially appreciated the numerous pictures included to show how the rebounders are used.
3,Need DVD,I bought this book immediately after buying a mini trampolene and needed instruction. But it turns out that it cannot be adequately explained in a book. It really needs to be demonstrated in a video how to do the exercises. So I suggest to other beginners that they look for a DVD for instruction. I have not done this yet. What I found is it much more difficult and tiring to rebound than I expected so instruction should take this into account and this book does not make this clear. Beginners need to be advised on very gentle rebounding for the first fortnight until the muscles strengthen. Dont try to bounce with your feet leaving the surface of the trampoline during this time.
5,Not just for kids,This is a real watch. My wife loves it because she is allergic to metal. I often wear one also. Its a real conversation piece.
4,"It's ""OK""","I thought it'd be a bit sturdier, being from lego and all. The plastic pieces of the strap quickly softened with use up and now come easily apart, which is good if you want it to be easy to change back and forth but bad if you're thinking of a resilient watch. Still, for a kid it's awesome, has taken some good hits and it's still there."
5,"Finally, a midsized watch for my fussy 10 year old","His wrist was too small for mens, too masculine for a womans watch but way too grown up for those babyish kiddie watches. This IS the perfect accessory for all of your LEGO maniacs! Fun to re-design as well."
3,Hasbro,"Clue is not made for my machine. It's Windows XP compatible. Mine is Windows2000 XP. I didn't realize there is a difference. It still works(sometimes) but not well. It has black patches wherever my cursor goes and the picture flashes. Monopoly is fuin though! I already own the other two. Unfortunetly, I bought it for Clue!"
1,horrible,"Clue doesn't work, monopoly is very difficult to play, and scrabble is lame. Life seems to work ok.Save your money.A cup of Starbucks does better than these games.Sorry I bought them.0 stars is not an option when rating. :("
4,Timeless fun for an empty nester,"I had trouble getting the kids to play the board games I've loved all my life. Now that they're out and gone, I'd given up finding people to play them with me. Hasbro has given me back my favorites and I can play them alone (or online if you prefer). A few glitches like in real life (sometimes it gets stuck on one person's turn and I'm sure the scrabble ref has it in for me). Some annoying animations but, thankfully, most are optional as you can customize the effects and attributes of each game. Bravo, Hasbro"
3,Classic Game Collection,"I bought this as a gift and, for the price, it's some great games. The only problem I had with it was one of Clue's views (not needed) wouldn't work right. Besides that, it is lots of fun."
3,Beware,This product was suppose to be for a XP version computer. That is what mine is. Clue game flickers constantly. It loops after the third game which means you have to wait and wait until it cancels the computer players turn before it moves on to the next player. It has locked up on me three times in the last three months. I love playing clue but it makes it not so fun. They need to stop the cliches. The other games I have not had any problems with and that is why I rated this product a three. The Clue games brings it down two notches.
2,Moon is going down the tubes,Well Army of Juan isn't that bad of a band..... they do lack something that I just can't put my finger on though. If moon keeps bands like this one coming in they will be an even bigger laughing stock then they already are.... Thats all
2,Interesting but poorly written,"After watching Boardwalk Empire, I wanted more info on Atlantic City's best years. This author has the info, but it is more HER story and less gangsters, smuggling, speakeasies, rum-running, drugs, prostitution and other vice.I'm about halfway through the book and I'm having a tough time finishing it. She's no writer."
3,Mezzo mezzo,"That's Italian for ""so-so."" The author offers much insight as to how Atlantic City ran in the 1920's through the 1950's, but she is no writer. Disjointed thoughts abound. She also uses quite a bit of dialogue which sounds hokey at best and ridiculous at worst, and which had to be created just for this book. Given that she was Skinny D'Amato's sister-in-law, much of the book centers on him & his relationship with various Hollywood stars. What she offers about A.C. you can get almost anywhere."
3,"Not the best version, but very ergonomic","Not a fan of the Amplified Bible. Also, the Japanese is translated from the English, not the Greek. However, it is easy to understand, and a great tool to use for anyone going to visit Japan. I gave this to my girlfriend before she went to Japan to study for a year. Great evangelism tool."
5,(Quality) time flies,"Frishberg is one classy guy and a uniquely talented song writer. He also plays piano very well. This CD contains nearly an hour of entertainment but time flies when listening to these delights. Sometimes silly, sometimes touching - thoroughly fantastic."
2,"Textless photo essay, for Route 66 completists only","This slim volume isn't really a book. It's a totally textless (not even captions) photo gallery taken by Mr. Baker along Route 66. In addition to the ""roadside"" images of motels, travelers and scenery one might expect in a Route 66 photo essay, there are several pointless photos of images on TV screens, and at least two too many shots of roadkill. This book is no substitute for driving the highway -- or even for looking over the photo album of a friend who's driven Route 66."
1,Complete waste of money,"It's just a book full of pictures. No words, no text, no anecdotes just various random pics of Americana on or around Route 66. Avoid."
3,For children that can read,"I had purchased this to go along with another product that actually puts the images on the wall. The original projector came with a Discovery slide that TALKED about zoo animals and was educational. When I purchased it, it gave this item as a possible match with it. So when I received it, i was surprised that it did not have the function to speak as the other one had. So for my 2yr old and 4 yr old it wasn't as useful without an adult reading the story line to them."
4,Perfect for the Moto-X kid in your life.....,"It is so hard to find any bedroom decor dealing with Moto-x or dirt bikes in general. When I saw this, I had to get it for my 7 yo son. Once I got it, I was rather impressed! It is bright and colorful. After washing it, the blanket kept it's shape and stayed full. The only downfall are the accessories. I do not care for any other accessories that match the comforter. I think they should have focused more on the theme rahter than the ""x"" pattern. I just paired this with solid, matching sheets and it looks great. We love it and my sons says. ""IT ROCKS""!"
4,An enjoyable romp,"This book reads like a screenplay; and the movie of the book is faithful to the text. The story is clever, the book is well-written, and the result is a generalized feeling of well-being. If you want a fun read to divert your attentions from the affairs of life/ work/ or other stress-producing events, this is an enjoyable frolic and detour."
1,I hate it more than life itself,"Say what you like about Martin Amis, at least he has a reader-friendly prose style. Which is more than can be said for Kingsley Amis. From a purely techno-linguistic viewpoint, the fic in question is unreadable. Ian Bell came up with a spot-on metaphor when he made mention of Kingsley's ""paragraphs of oak"". Heavy, unwieldy, boring as hell. It's the literary equivalent of Orson Welles sitting on your face for 294 pages."
4,great buy for the price!! for beginners wanting to loose weight,"this is a great buy for the price. i am not a fitness enthusiast but wanted to try and loose the extra weight i put on throughout the years. the speed and incline is very good and easy to adjust. it is very quiet. i can watch tv or listen to the radio with it on. i also live in an apartment so it is not disturbing to the neighbors. i do not run so i cannot atest to that, but i enjoy it for walking.it does however beep loudly when it is turned on. that does get annoying but it quickly shuts off.the box was difficult to open because the label was small saying not to cut the straps from the box a certain way. it is my own fault for not reading it though!it was very easy to put together-very little set up. it is much larger than i anticipated.if you are looking to start a workout program to loose weight and on a budget, this is a great treadmill."
3,VERY weak...should have gotten the heavy duty version,"For how much this item weighs, it doesn't really have the strength to support much. This arm is unable to hold a speedlight on a cold shoe without slowly sagging down. The heavy duty version of the arm would be the way to go if you want to firmly hold anything more than a bounce-card indoors."
1,NOT STRONG ENOUGH,"DID NOT MEET MY REQUIREMENTS FOR PUROSE OF BUYING IT 10 INCH MONITOR ATTACHED TO IT AND WILL NOT HOLD IT MAYBE MY MISTAKE SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT STRONGER VERSION,CLUMSY SITTING HOME DOING NOTHING WAITING TO BE THROWN IN THE GARBAGE.WASTED MINEY."
5,Toshiba is KING of HDTV,"Ask most video heads, and they will agree Toshiba is the best. I had a 53hx71 that I recently sold, and I bought this set from Amzon last week. The shipping was the only headache and most of that was me wanting some instant gradification.I live in LA and the TV was shipped out 5 hours away... but yet it took a week to get... thats stupid. Its annoying when you track it and it says its at LAX (20 mins away).. I wanted to walk it home!The actual TV is AMAZING.. the regular cable looks great, and this is the first series I have seen that you dont noticed regular tv being stretched!! The HDTV rocks, the only negative thing I can think of is having to adjust all the inputs because its shipped with the contrast at 100!...take that down to about 48...Seriously, this tv is a HUGE bang for a small buck."
5,Valid about 5 years ago,Been hammering on this thing since NEW back in 08? B4 the BIG LEDs' prices started to drop thru the floor & I don't regret the purchase. If you can get one cheep enough ($200 MAX) then it could be a good addition to a rec. room.
5,Fantastic,My first big screen HD TV. For the money I am shocked at the value this TV offers. I know people who spent $1000 more for a TV that doesn't even come close to the quality picture that this television has. It also has a fantastic built in audio system that is more than capable of holding its own...Not much to gripe about here.
1,Frustrated Customer,"DO NOT GET THIS TV unless you want a really large paperweight! A few weeks after delivery the TV stopped working, and could not be repaired. Repairman said that he is called to repair several of this model a week and recommended returning it and getting something from a different manufacturer. Tohiba customer service was very unpleasant and it took sever weeks of arguing to get it returned. I have just purchased a SONY and am looking forward to receiving it."
2,Mediocre at best,"This book seemed rushed to me. A lot of what happens is repetitious, and in fact the middle third of the book feels quite a bit like filler. You can pretty much cut out everything from when they leave the main city up until the encounter with the final tribe and not miss anything plot-wise. A lot of what happens in the plot is paint-by-numbers as well, which doesn't help.There's some pretty interesting insights into Anakin's character (if you consider acting whiny and spoiled interesting), but that's about it. IMHO, most people can and should skip this one. For a much better pre-Ep2 novel, try Rogue Planet by Greg Bear."
3,"Some fine characterizations, but otherwise not much here...","The tagline ""An exciting prologue ot Star Wars : Attack of the Clones"" was enough to entice me to buy this book; however, I wonder if I should have just borrowed it from the library. While I found some of what Foster was attmpting to do good, the plot left much to be desired. The beginnings of Anakin's turn are clearly seen : his longing to return to Tatooine, his attitude toward Obi-Wan, his growing impatience, and anger were clearly seen. I even found his questionable attitude toward Yoda's teaching fascinating. I enjoyed the addition of Luminara and her apprentice, Barriss (hopefully they will be around for the rapidly approachiing Episode II). The final pages with Count Dooku also whetted my appetite for more. But the remainder of the book left much to be desired. I just did not find myself caring for the inhabitants of Ansion nor whether or not they seceeded from the Republic."
1,What a frustrating waste of time.,"It's hard to describe in 1,000 words what a disappointment this book was.Alan Dean Foster must have been paid by the word. That's the only thing that explains the endless, pointless descriptions of alien animal life. Every dialog is three times longer than it needs to be - the author says the same thing three times in different ways, adding no insight.I'm a big fan of Jude Watson's Jedi Apprentice series. This book is nothing like those. It has no plot and offers no insight into the Jedi world or the political situation that leads up to AotC. It doesn't even focus on Obi Wan and Anikan. Rather, it focuses on a different, superfluous, obnoxious, condescending Master/Padawan team.If you are going to read this book, you can safely skip chapters 7 through 14 (inclusive) and miss absolutely nothing important. Better yet, read all of the Jude Watson books instead."
2,How does this fit in with anything???,"Whoa! Five pages to rent a few lousy beasts of burden. This is a RPG Magazine 5-pager stretched out by 295 extra pages of mindless babble. Man, if I wasn't a totally hooked 'completionist' I tell you...! And what's up with the Trade Federation? One book they rule, another they drool... And Obi Wan as a totally non-plussed, non-emotive aloof self-absorbed Jedi Elitist? Hey, it's only been a few years since ""Rogue Planet"" and everyone has become someone else. If you want post-TPM Star Wars action without a remote, lame tie-in to the upcoming blockbuster movie read ""Rogue Planet"" - 100X better all around."
3,not your usual star wars,"this is a bit unusual for a star wars novel. a low-tech world; an almost total lack of force usage; and a fairly low amount of action. the descriptions are good (you can picture the things being mentioned) which is good. but the characters dont seem like jedi. they spend days at one point as prisoners tied with rope they should easily escape from. overall, this is a pretty disappointing book."
1,This book is ridiculously horrible.,Please someone tell me why we have books like this created for the Star Wars universe? I love the Expanded Universe but hate it when I waste hrs. on books like this.
2,"It's a 1hour Television Show, when I Expected an Epic",This book was by far my least favorite star wars book ever. It was boring and slow. The bad guys where uninteresting and the action was ok.
2,A very disapointing book,"The best part of the book is the last four pages that (hopefully) lead into the upcoming Star Wars movie. The interactions between Obi Wan, Anakin, and other Jedi are interesting, but they really don't add any new information. The book really lacks for a good strong plot, an unusual problem for Star Wars books. The book is incredibly predictable, and you know what is going to happen long before it happens.Personally I would recommend this book only to die hard Star Wars fans. If your looking for suspense and action try the New Jedi Order books."
3,Missing some Star Wars elements,"Because this book is set shortly before Attack of the Clones, the book focuses on political intrigue and offers a little bit of insight about some of the people involved in the Separatist movement. I give the book 3 stars because I liked the characters of Jedi Knight Luminara and her Padawan, the pair that accompanies Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker on this particular mission. I also like some of the descriptions of some of the Jedi Force-based abilities. However, there is no galatic battle scene and no thrilling lightsaber duels so unless you really like political intrigue and Jedi lore, I think you may find this dull. And if you skip this book, I don't think you would miss much."
3,Anecdote not Prologue,"This is good story telling. Characters have depth, descriptions of new species and worlds are rich. This book gets into the mind of Anakin Skywalker and gives us hints to his development as a Jedi Padawan. And, it displays some of the Jedi abilities in ways not previously seen, especially as mediators.I gave this book only 3 stars because it did not enrich my understanding of events in play immediately preceding Episode II. It is not needed as a ""prologue"" for Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, and the historical events would have been more appropriate as a footnote to Episode II."
3,"Great characters, mediocre plot","While I agree with the mass opinion that this is not a very exciting story, it had another value that was seriously redeeming. The characterization of Obi-Wan and Anakin. After seeing Attack of the Clones, it's almost scary how well Foster captures their personalities on paper. It's right up there with the way Timothy Zahn took on the main characters from the classic trilogy, or A.C. Crispin's take on Han Solo. Back to the Approacing Storm, the main plot revolves around the Jedi Council sending in Jedi to persuade the planet Ansion not to leave the republic. I really didn't keep reading ahead for the story, but rather to see how the Jedi handled the situations they stumbled into.To sum up, bland story, excellent characterization of Obi-Wan and Anakin."
5,Great product.,Belt was as expected and is a great belt. Safariland makes good stuff. Shipping was quick. These belts last a long time without showing wear.
5,"This is not a toy, it is just decoration.","This was a gift for my husband because ""A Christmas Story"" is his favorite Christmas movie. He really likes it and it is on his desk at work!"
3,IT'S OK,I brought this for my doctor for xmas because I say he looks like Ralphie so I got this but when he opened it his glasses fell off so I had to super glue ralphies glasses back on but over all its cool I like it. I was just disappointed I received it damaged.
5,Magnificent and Inspiring!,"Maxilmiliano's voice is magnificent...he inspires me...makes me feel like closing my eyes, allowing myself to be mesmorized by his voice. His lyrics are visionary and encourage me to dream...What a gift he is to modern music...truly delightful. He reminds me of the great Cat Stevens...classic, uniquely soulful, and with a depth that can not be described...just listen and you'll feel his beauty, kindness and gentileness. I highly recommend this CD!"
5,This sure sounds good to me,"One of the better CDs that I have purchased over the past year. Dreamworld is great - Nealon has an amazing voice, the guitars sing, and the lyrics will make you think.If you are looking for something new and fresh, give this is a shot, you will not be disappointed.I&#65533;m already looking forward to the next album!!"
2,Less helpful than I expected,"I should have looked a little more closely before buying this book. It's totally brand and celebrity focused, sprinkled with quotes from the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow to Kimora Simmons, and product recommendations including brand new Jimmy Choo stilettos to accomodate your swelling feet (seriously!). Also not sure I needed to buy a book for earth-shattering advice such as: ""if you're hair becomes dry, switch to a more rich conditioner meant for dry hair"". No kidding. There is an extensive list of websites that sell stylish maternity clothes, and I am sure if you go through them all you are bound to find stuff you like. Overall, I felt it was a little over the top, and not very practical for the average woman but I guess that's what rock star means. You've been warned."
2,Okay - but wouldn't buy again,Read this book at your local library or see if a friend bought it and share the book. I didn't find it to be really interesting.
3,"If you want real pregnancy info, don't bother here. This is just a fun novelty type book!",This is a fun read. It has cute fashion tips in here but outside of that this book is probably geared more towards celebrities. The author references clothes that are probably more than the average woman wants to spend during her pregnancy. I am all about designer clothes but I'm not sure this book has any valuable information about what to expect during a pregnancy. So don't buy this with that expectation. Buy this as a fun read.
5,Best of 2010,Most of the best matches of matches of the year all on here can't get better than that. Anyone looking to get a good value for your money should check it out.
4,Good year in the UFC,This does a good job at htting all the main events in 2010. This is a good buy for how much it cost and I recommend it to the UFC fan.
4,Would like more 'extras',"The fights were mostly amazing, the picture was out of this world. I was hoping for more along the lines of short interviews, ring girls and maybe reactions after the fight by the fighters setting up the next year's fights/disc. Overall, excellent picture and fight choices."
5,what you see is what you get.....,"it's the UFC BEST OF 2010, it's pretty self explanatory I'm not going to say this fight was bad or this fight was good, it is what it is......."
5,Outstanding,"Louise Shaffer has outdone herself with this book! The book was so outstanding that I couldn't put it down. Louise is not only an academy award winning actress, but now a brilliant author. I look forward to reading her next book."
5,Wonderful Book for Babies of all ages.,"This book is beautiful. The illustrations are typically excellent Felicia Bond but with a little more drama than whimsy at times. Second best by Margaret Wise Brown (Goodnight Moon is obviously first). The words are lyrical, rhyming, and captivating to the very young, and the older crowd isn't bored to tears or annoyed beyond words after re-reading it a hundred times. I got this book for my son five years ago, and it was his favorite for quite a while. Now my one-year old daughter carries it around and wants it read to her constantly as well. We love it. I believe it's a timeless classic, and every little one should have it in their collection."
5,Our Favorite,"Out of all the bedtime stories and other books that fill my 16-month old daughter's bookshelf, Big Red Barn is her (and my) favorite. The illustrations are remarkable, and the soft and gentle prose is very soothing. As she has gotten older, my daughter has enjoyed mimicing the sounds that all of the animals make. Plus, the story is an important one for children to learn: animals of all shapes and sizes live together happily in the Big Red Barn. It is simply my favorite nighttime book of all time."
5,A tried and true favorite!,I was given this book as a gift because it has been a favorite of many a child in our family. I like Brown's writing and this story has a rhythm that both parent and child find soothing. The illustrations go very well with the story and its not a book that you will become tired of reading. My eight-month old daugher loves it!
5,It's sopo-RIFFIC!,"This book works on so many levels. It's a simple board book for even the youngest readers, but its soothing messages about farm life will resonate well into the 2's and 3's, and maybe even into the early-reading years. We came back to this book again and again when my kids were little and it's still on the shelf... and I keep thinking, ""maybe someday, I'll be lucky enough to have a little one to read it to again."""
4,A Very Nice Read-Aloud for Boys and Girls,"Big Red Barn is one of those baby books that provokes either charm or annoyance in adult readers, and delight in young listeners. It is marked by Brown's soothingly rhythmic, repetitive text, sprinkled with farmyard animal noises that toddlers will love to imitate. The story opens with ""a pink pig/ who was learning to squeal"" greeting the sunrise. Other farm animals go about their activities throughout the day, and (just as inGoodnight Moon) the pictures become progressively darker as night falls on the barn.This classic board book is brightly illustrated, interactive and soothing. It's a good fit for both preverbal toddlers and children who are just beginning to understand how story events progress in sequence. It's a very nice choice for both boys and girls."
2,Not the Right Size for The Big Red Barn,"The Big Red Barn is one that my children and grandchildren have loved to read this book in its littler form. I suspect that this size will be so ungainly to handle that the child that I ordered this book for will not be able to handle it or hold it in bed, as did ours. I suspect also that because it is not a board book, it will not hold up very well. There was no way of telling when I ordered the book, that it was such a gigantic copy, but I would not have kept it had the date that I needed it for was too close to return the book and get another of the right size."
5,One of the greats,"I'm constantly amazed at how difficult it is to find good books for my 2-year old. Well, this book is excellent. It has cute animals, excellent text with a really good meter, beautiful drawings, and an adorable rural setting. Your toddler can moo and meow along with the animals."
5,Great read for children (and parents too)!,This book is a sure favorite of my daughters (4yrs and 2yrs). The words are catchy and very fun. An enjoyable read for parents too!
5,My kids still love this book!,"I first bought this book for my older daughter when she was about 2. She's now 5 and I have another 2-year-old daughter, and both girls love to have me read this book to them. Yes, it's simple, but the simple text gives ample ""discussion"" time, especially for little ones who want to point out animal names and sounds, and ask questions. We have the board book, which is worn out (literally) and with another baby on the way I'm buying a new version."
5,Great Book,My youngest just loves this book. Super pictures and simple story. Animals are always great.
5,Great learning book!,"Our 18 month old daughter loves this book. Easy to read, easy for her to follow. We enjoy it at bedtime. Words and pictures teach animals, some numbers, colors, etc. Much to gain from this book! Highly recommend!"
3,Cute book - too small for someone under 2,"I am writing this review based on two things. STORY and the BOOK THAT I ORDERED and received.I did know the size of this book when ordering. It is a cute book and cute story and I give the story 4 stars.The book I ordered and received, I give 2 stars. So my review is based both on the story and the book I received.STORY - 4 starsSmall boardbook - 2 starsMy 21 month old did not care for this small boardbook. He looked at it, but because the book was so small and the writing even smaller, he didn't care for it.I'm sure it would have been better in a larger form, but I wouldn't recommend this book in the small form."
5,So Quick!,I am so pleased with this product. I teach kindergarten and as anyone in this field or a similar one knows books get so expensive. It arrived so quickly and is in wonderful condition. I can't say enough about the PRICE! It is so much cheaper than some of the traditional places I buy from.
3,Illustrations are amateurish,"I love Margaret Wise Brown's books and I especially love the illustrations in the originals. The illustrations in this edition of The Big Red Barn are disappointing. The artist can't seem to decide between a realistic style and a cute, stylized look. It's not a big deal but when I'm reading the book for the hundredth time to my little grandson, it's the pictures I'm studying and thinking about. He loves the book, though."
2,Obviously not a M.W. Brown book!,"The illustrations are simple and lovely in this book. The text, however, is very poorly written with a tense that changes randomly. The book contains whole sections which do not fit the flow of the story - a rather sorry accomplishment in a board book. This book was a manuscript that M.W. Brown left when she died unexpectedly at a young age. The co-author then edited the manuscript and the publisher put it out. Read Run-Away Bunny instead for classic Margaret Wise Brown"
2,Doesn't do it for us,Just a basic farm book like many others. Doesn't really do it for my kids. We own a lot of board books and none of mine ever attached to this one. They prefer Boynton books.
1,BORING,I'm sorry this is a sweet book but it is sooooooo boring. If your child likes fun books that rhyme and a interesting story this is not the book you want.
1,Sony cassett player,"FX290 Sonny, Walkman Plaer.For my purposes works very well. I've usedmy Walkman exercising on our treadmill eversince received it.For me great. Down side plays only oneside of the tape if you want to hear moreyou have to manually turn it to the otherside.Unable to get a clear station on the radiotv portion of the player. But for listeningto your tapes every day it is great.Jane"
3,good but not great,"First, a technical complaint. Although all the DVDs from which these excerts come have 3 audiio tracks (PCM, DD5.1 & DTS 5.1), this DVD is only PCM stereo. Why can't we hear the superior 5.1 audios the audio of the origonal DVDs?The performances are all good, but none are outstanding. Also, and this is a matter of personal taste, I do not care for most of the selections. If the purpose of a sampler is to persuade the viewer to buy some of the DVDs which it samples, this sampler was unsucessful with me, since I am not interested in buying any of them."
5,Excellent source- Information very up to date,"As the VP of The Distance Learning Expo, we get many inquires on distance and online learning. We always keep the Bear's Guide close by in case there is a question we cannot answer. The information is very up to date and very easy to follow."
1,Disgusted by this book,"I am completely disuusted that this man is still allowed to sell his books. After buying this so-called ""guide"", I discovered that this man founded and/or was intimately involved with at least 4 degree mills in the past.Greenwich UniversityFairfax UniversityColumbia State UniversityInstitute for Advanced StudiesHow does he get away with this?"
2,Beware the Kindle edition of this guidebook.,"We're traveling in Andalucía right now and I loved the idea of a Rough Guide to the region on my Kindle. Was very disapointed to find it has no index, or none that neither I nor my husband could find. A guide book without an index just seems useless to me, so I returned it.I was prepared for the fact that the maps wouldn't work so well, but really, you have to find your way around you guide if you're going to find your way around a region."
3,save 12 bucks unless u lik block bots,this is an ok set. The leg and chest are durable but not the arms.
5,Great for Personal Worship,Terry MacAlmon is great for a large group and has a wonderful anointed way of drawing each person into worship. His CD's are also so effective for personal worship time. I listen to several songs on his CD's every day as a prelude to my prayer time and find them very helpful to clear my thoughts and enter into His presence.
4,Beyond Brutal,"This band absolutely destroys. This record isn't as complex as some other albums out there, but it definitely brings the mosh. It'll be interesting to see what these guys put together as a follow-up in the midst of the current wave of metal. I think there's a new record coming out this year, but in the meantime, i'll be sure to keep this one in the player."
1,"I second, Don't Buy This Book!","What looks like an interesting learning experience has turned into a nightmare. Whoever writes the promotional copy for this book FAILS to tell you that you MUST have Lotus Notes, Domino and R5 already on your system! I find it criminal to have intentionally omitted this important fact when you are trying to make a purchase decision."
2,Don't buy this book!!!,"The style is friendly, the content good and the authors seemingly well-versed. But all the advertised web-support for the book has been removed by the publisher. And the CD doesn't work. The error message states that the "".nsf"" file is in an invalid format. Sure enough, the book's web site has a one-question FAQ which says they have confirmed the problem, that the authors have been unresponsive to it, and that you can get a full refund for the book (if, as it turns out, you send it back to the publisher and pay shipping.)I was very disappointed. I'm sending the book back to the publisher and hoping for the best. Don't let this happen to you."

2,barely used for a month and a half :(,the card shuffler gear is already wearing and its ruining my cards wont buy one of these again!!!
3,Card shuffler,"Granddaughter, age 7, is pleased that she can now shuffle the cards when it is her turn."
4,shuffle shuffle,Not perfect but for the price it does the job. So far no problems although one battery door had a minor bit of damage. Not enough damage to hinder the operation.We are satisfied but don't expect it to last forever.Not exactly a play toy but could be easily used by kids who have trouble shuffling a deck of cards.
4,Pretty good,It works pretty well most of the time. The other times cards get stuck on the sides of the insides. Would recommend getting the 6-deck shuffler by same company. Works like a charm.
1,Import junk,In order to make this work I had to rob parts from the old one. This is truly an import piece of junk and I wouldn't waste my money again. I'm surprised Amazon would continue to carry such junk.
1,"Look for the version that uses ""C"" cell batteries!","I bought this shuffler and immediately returned it.It looks itentical to one that I already have and love.This one uses 4 AA size bateries, and is a piece of junk.The one that looks EXACTLY the same and uses 4 C batteries is just great.The one that I already have I picked up at an auction 3 years ago and it works.I use it 3 times a week and have only replaced the batteries twice in all that time.Look for the good one and don't buy anything that uses AA batteries, as you'll be dissapointed."
4,"Excellent excellent, it covers everything!","I really like this book, and wish more people were reading it. It covers everything from the Neolithic cultures to the beginnings of patriarchy to the breaking of the Goddess into her many ""aspects"" to the rise of xianity to the Crusades, the Inquisition, the Burning times, everything. The atrocities that ""man"" and ""the church"" has done against the earth and females in general are well spelled out. Even explains why and how bisexuality & homosexuality were acceptable in prepatriarchal times & why they aren't acceptable to ""the church"". Very very thorough, very well researched. Very recommended!"
5,awesome......,This book was totally awesome.... It contain a wealth of information. Although it specifically uncoverers the Mother earth of the universe it also explains indepth the fathers original intentions...A must read for women and most importantly a must embracement for men...Enter at your own acknowledgement.
5,a brainstorming book,"It seemed I had always had an appointment with such a book. Many, many things I believed in and that I always thought had nothing in common are suddenly harmoniously tied together. It is really hard, though, to read this book, for it totally uproots your vision of the world, inscribing everyday life injustices into a long tradition (machismo, harm done to women, ""minorities"", the earth...). But the clearer your vision, the harder to bear those realities - and the more necessary to have it read around. If you don't find peace in the world (the day it happens, call me!!) you can find it within yourself, and believe me, i wasn't one for mysticism!"
5,Free Your Mind And Your Heart Will Follow-among other things,Preserve your sanity and read this book. Take what you find and decide and think for yourself
4,She Changes Everything She Touches... :},"I am in the middle of the book as we speak. It is excellent! Very large and packed with empowering information about everything you've ever wanted to know about prepatriarchal matristic civilizations! Makes me want to go smack some men upside the head, and go live far away from ""modern"" society. Brightest Blessings to both Miss Sjoo & Miss Mor."
3,"Great book, bad science.",This is a great book based on faulty science. No one really knows what happened in prehistory yet the author has inferred alot from a few relics. The book is good reading because is nevertheless believable. Patriarchy runs the world and not very well so we long for a mystical Avalon. Enjoy the book but only as a fairy tale with a good moral.
2,Jackie Lite,"A facile and predictable treatment that breaks no new ground and in some cases, as in regard to Robinson's famous tryout with the Red Sox, is not only wrong but weirdly apologetic in regard to that organization. There are so many better choices for a book on Robinsonn - Simon's NPR pulpit should not give him the right to mail in a book like this."
1,Derivative and amateurish book,"This book offers nothing in the way of original research or new conclusions about the integration of organized baseball; it is full of errors, special pleading, and misplaced nostalgia. It also fails to acknowlege its debt to the superior work of others, especially Jules Tygiel (*Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and his Legacy*) and John C. Chalberg (*Rickey and Robinson: The Preacher, the Player and America's Game*). Purchase either of the latter books (or both) and give this misconceived vanity effort a pass."
2,Alibis for the Red Sox,"Mr. Simon is an esteemed radio journalist, but this book hardly qualifies for even the low standards of sports journalism. Many factual errors, and Mr. Simon spends almost as much time coming up with excuses for why the Red Sox were the last team to integrate, as he does celebrating Jackie Robinson and those who spurred the re-integration of ""Organized Baseball."" This dashed-off effort completely overlooks that Blacks WERE previously in Organized Baseball, but were booted out."
4,common you old heepsters!,"Well, after so long listening to Ken Hensley on solo albums and during his Uriah Heep era, I must say this CD shows that he is still as good as he was then.But then, experience and technology results in one of Hensley's best album in his entire carreer. What else can it be said? Listen to it!"
2,Needs more specific details,"This ""guide"" reads more like an overview of the angling possibilities in BC. Not enough specific information about a lot of bodies of water. There are also some poorly written (and edited!) essays that I would have rather seen replaced with more details and or more rivers. To sum up, it's not very comprehensive and if you're looking for specific info on a particular river, you may be disappointed."
1,Made me really depressed,"In almost all the scenarios presented by the author, the patient dies. At the beginning of the book, she does say that she has purposely chosen tough situations so that her readers can feel encouraged if their situation is really bad. However, reading about these cases that almost all result in the death of the patient is not encouraging. I wish I hadn't read it, as it took me a while to get out of the depressed mood this book put me in. I do not recommend this book for those trying to find hope - it's more for people who have reconciled themselves to dying of the diseaseThe author has done a really great job of encouraging cancer patients and caregivers in a subsequent book called ""Finding the Light in Cancer's Shadow: Hope, Humor, and Healing after Treatment"". I would recommend this book instead"
4,A thought provoking book,"On July 31 of 2009, my neurosurgeon told me to go home and wait to die. That didn't really suit me, as I have two small daughters to raise. Instead, I went home and decided to live. With the initial surgery in July, I thought I could do it without God's help, but that changed pretty quickly, when I realised there are some things in this life where you do need God's help. I bought this book with great expectations, but stopped reading after chapter one - I didn't see much hope in the story (I didn't feel I needed to reminded yet again that miracles don't always happen), but then the author suggested I start reading at chapter 5, which I did, and from there I read the whole book. So my suggestion, is to start at Chapter five. God bless."
2,When God and Cancer Meet,"I am a chaplain on the oncology unit of a large hospital and I would NOT recommend this book to all of my patients. I would recommend it to those who were Chrisitans or on the road to becoming Christians. The author's exclusive Christian view of life would not be helpful to our patients' that are of a different spiritual persuasion. One would think, while reading this book, that one would need to become a Christian to be either cured of their cancer or make sense of the disease. There were two good quotes near the end of the book that were useful; i.e. one about hope and the other by Chuck Swindol which I have used in my ministry with patients of all spiritual persuasions."
4,IT'S OK FOR THE PRICE,when this gun came in the mail it looked awsome!So i tryed it. It was pretty cool. But the bipod does not work(breaks easly)Pretty good gun for a low price. Also it comes with paintballs which i thought was pretty cool!
4,Excellent Value/Solid Gun,"This gun has excellent custom features, and is much heavier than expected. All around great buy."
4,Ok gun,"I just orderd my gun on 11/18/06 and i got it on the 22nd, when i opend it, it felt like cheap plastic i liked the flash light and the laser. It comes with a silencer but that doesnt do anything when you shoot the spring makes a loud sound and you cant do anything about it. Dilivery was fast it works fine a little plasticey and hold vary little bb's its really light (because it cheap plastic)but other than that it looks great real actual size."
1,Piece of Poop!!!,"This gun not only smelled like a piece of poop when i got it but it also performed like one!!!! The day i got it the bipod cracked (during normal use)and fell off!!! The next day (i am really into airsoft) the silencer fell off and was no longer silencing!!! 2 days later the cocking mechanism snapped and that was the end of the short life of this piece of POOP!!! I would NOT recomend this gun. The box claims that it can shoot fifty feet, i wouldnt even give it ten!?!?!?! The scope was basically a paper towel tube! Even its Butt fell off! This gun is the WORST gun you could ever buy! I would recomend buying a gun from Dunhams or even Walmart!!!!!!!!!"
1,Worthless junk,Gun is worthless. Broken in packaging. Ultra flimsy plastic. Bad customer service from Hobbytron. No way to get a refund. They sent a replacement of the same worthless piece of junk. DO NOT BUY.
1,Not worth the money,This is a poorly constructed gun. Bipod will not stay together. Parts easily break. Not worth the money.
5,Real GOLD,"This book blows the lid off of the fossil fuel MYTH!!! Every American needs to read this. It is well researched and written!!! This book along with Dr. Thomas Gold's book The Deep Hot Biosphere: The Myth of Fossil Fuels, will forever change your view of oil availability, oil dependence, and oil consumption."
1,Time will tell.,"I have no dog in this fight, but, really, this is kind of a silly book. Not particulary well researched or well argued - embarrassing, really.Anyway, it doesn't matter what I think, just ask yourself this: If we really are awash in oil (at about $130/barrel today) - don't you think someone would have found it by now? Even just a little of this oil the authors claim to know about??? Yes, there could be cause for 'hiding' this fact to keep oil priced, but how could so many independent companies/countries/scientists collude on keeping secret such a valuable resource?And, yes, the authors don't really understand centrifugal vs. centripetal force. Google exactly that and see for yourself."
3,Plea to readers,"For anyone who is considering reading this book: Please don't take this book to heart unless you really are objective about the issues it presents and research both sides, or rather the spectrum of possibilities out there for oil generation and production. If you are objective about this I hope your research leads you in the most likely direction. Additionally, it is okay to change your opinion on subjects and even admit that you are wrong once in a while!"
1,For Those Knowing Little Geology - a nice piece of fiction,"While the authors are well known, their background is not in the sciences or in engineering - a prerequisite to speak intelligently about oil and gas exploration. The attempt to set up ""abiotic oil"" as a valid source for petroleum is not only poorly done and referenced, but the examples they cite are already proven to have biogenic origin! As someone actually doing this for a living, this book is a very humorous read, chock full of unsubstantiated claims and incredibly wrong assumptions. Even the Russians now look for oil the same way we do - somehow they forgot to mention that small fact.Great bathroom fodder..."
1,Bullturd,"This movie was not even good. Probably going to use this disc to scrape snow off the car tomorrow.Sincerely,Disappointed"
3,"Was good, end was a bit of a letdown","Title says it. Was very good, but really kinda fell apart at the end. I was throughly entertained until the end"
2,Plot not filled in,Focused too much on action and violence and not enough on what could have been a good science fiction story. Too bad.
5,"Very creative, original sci-fi action thriller. New twist on time-travel plot.","I loved this movie! It has all the elements of a cheesy blockbuster, but somehow succeeds in avoiding all the tropes and cliches. It's a completely original concept even though it's futuristic-police-force-of-mercenaries has been done (poorly) before in The 6th Day, Minority Report, and Total Recall. I loved the new take on time travel and liked how the filmmakers handled the obvious logical problems associated with having yourself and a future version of yourself in the same present moment. It was a mental stretch, but I had no trouble suspending my disbelief.All in all a must-watch movie. Bruce Willis is totally great and actually doesn't overwhelm the rest of the cast, who all got a chance to act along side the superstar."
4,"Suspense filled, excellent sci-fi.",I found this film to hold my attention throughout as I tried to make sense of the time travel. It has been alleged in the past that when going back or forward in time you needed to avoid making contact with yourself. Apparently this is not true as Spock revealed in the latest Star Trek and now in Looper. This is good to know for when I make the trip into time myself. Looper is exciting and action packed coupled with thought provoking concepts. A fun movie.
4,Gotta love time travel paradoxes and plot twists,"That's the great thing about time travel movies that are well thought out, many plot twists become possible, and Rian Johnson has written and directed a great movie here using this device very well. Finally a sci-fi movie that is worth the price of admission after so many big budget diasappointments of late. Goes to show you, sci-fi that requires some thinking will always beat out sci-fi that only requires CGI."
2,Wasn't enjoyable,"I personally did not enjoy this movie. Just thought it was predictable and perhaps formulaic? Anyway, I would suggest renting it before buying it."
1,pointless characters and waste of a good idea,"the idea behind the movie was great, but it was very poorly executed. I didn't care a fig for any of the characters."
1,Looper,"I like Willis movies even though they are usually way over the top. However, this movie is brutal and violent. I stopped watching it when he was about to kill a small child. Terminator one was pretty violent but this was just bad. I would not recommend it even as an action movie!! Two thumbs down!!"
1,Very Dissapointed,"Gave this a one star. Bought it because Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were in it. The Acting is ok, but the story line lacks depth and is often times boring."
2,$20 for 1 disc?,"Why is there no DVD and/or Digital Copy with this release? And no, Ultraviolet doesn't count, nobody uses that and you don't actually get the file to keep on your own computer.Most new release movies are $20-$24 on Blu-Ray with a DVD and Digital Copy. This is just a blu-ray and it's the same price? What gives?"
3,"Strange, but intriguing.",Inventive concepts. Difficult to watch on the computer because the sound was extremely low in parts. It also crashed about 15 times.
3,"Great movie, if you can get past the time paradox...","Enjoyed the movie, interesting plot, decent action, however, I decided on a 3 instead of a 4, because of the obvious time paradox blunder created by the writers, like an irritating blister. Of course, that's Hollywood for ya. For me, this is one of those movies like the Sixth Sense... Once you've seen the movie, the ending leaves you with knowledge making it hard to watch the movie again. Who knows, maybe I'll change my tune later, but not anytime soon. Good flick though, definite need to see at least once."
4,good movie,"Keeps you wondering for sure what will happen, and then, what will happen after the movie is over. Great thriller."
3,Just shoot your hand off!,Duh. Ending made no sense. None of that stuff would have happened with the actual ending. Blowing his hand off would have bought some time. Other than that the movie was good. Besides the really huge loose end. I thought maybe they would let love win and raise the boy in a loving 2 parent family but whatever. Raise him good. Problem solved. Also I kept waiting for Levitt to revert to his real face in the movie. But they kept it that way the whole time. Did he get a facelift? WHY?!
3,Worth watching,It's an interesting concept with some good actors. I thought it was let down by a lack of depth in the characters and a number of holes in the plot devices.
4,LOOP LOOP LOOPER !,"great movie awesome acting , wanted a different ending ! but the ending was ok. it would really be good to see the other story line goes on thou"
4,Great movie,"I love the movie, but I gave it 4 stars for not having the dvd combo. I would at least like the option."
3,It was OK.,"As I was watching the film, I was underwhelmed and not impressed. I thought it SUCKED actually, then the ending was a nice surprise. I would have given it one star had it not been for the fairly decent ending. There were some slow parts throughout the movie. This is no ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Die Hard"" if you're used to Bruce Willis being fully loaded on high octane. Bruce Willis actually shows a softer side in this movie. Three stars - you just have to get to the end to really appreciate it."
4,interesting,i thought the concept of the whole film was quite creative and intense. I would recommend anyone that love action and story twists to watch.
2,Was let down,"It's very subjective, the business of liking/not liking a movie. To me, this movie was a letdown. Violent (I'm ok with violence done well), and not at all original even with time travel being the main theme. A kid with mutant powers, ego's (lots of them), crazies, ""the man"", etc., etc. A confusing mess of a movie."
3,Totally Trippy,Time Travel.... Always found interesting. I'm a huge fan of science fiction. I won't get into details about how good the movies I let you decide for yourself. Is it worth renting or streaming most definitely. The fact that future me could be sent back in time to be murdered by present me gave me nightmares.
4,Follow the guns.,"This is a guy movie. The premise is a little far out. It is a ""travel back in time to kill your grandfather"". I liked it. Herb Watkins"
4,Add this to,"your sci-fi favorites. Sure, it's no Bladerunner, but it offers some new ideas about time travel that, if you are as much of a sci-fi nerd as me, will keep you fretting over the temporal integrity this story presents."
5,Great Action Movie,"Definitely worth watching. Entertaining, interesting, and thought provoking. It does require some thinking regarding the time travel aspect, but not to the point that it ruins the movie."
3,Logically not very consistent,"The film shooting was OK, but it was logically flawed, thus not very exciting. The actors and actress are fine."
3,"Decent movie, doesn't meet the expectations of the hype, but worth seeing.","The production and concept of the movie was great, however I feel like they missed an opportunity to really make something special."
4,Pretty good,"Good movie, what I would call a great one timer. I wouldn't buy it, but I would recommend watching at least the once."
4,Good movie....,"Interesting plot. Me and my wife really liked it, but there were a couple parts that were hard to watch because of the violence, but good movie overall."
3,?,Did not like this movie very much. The premise was confusing...Will have to watch it again to get a better understanding...
4,Looper,My son-in-law loves this movie but he needed to explain some of it to me...might be better watching the second time just to understand what is going on.
2,poor effort,"We did not care for this movie. Over hyped with the emphasis on Bruce Willis. Interesting story line/concept, justt could have used better acting."
4,Hard time following this one.,Still didn't figure out if the kid on the train was him & if it was that meant he slept with his mother? Any movie with Bruce Willis is good for me.
3,So So movie,Slightly interesting plot helps to make you not so focused on the bad acting by the lead actor. He just doesn't portray a good mob hit-man from the future killing people from the even further future to me lol And I should know! HAHAHA
4,Cool plot!,really enjoyed this movie! Very different story line than most holly wood movies of late. you should rent it tonight
4,Would like to see another just like it!!,"Some time travel movies tend to confuse, but this one a simple premise. Future you comes back in time to stop something in the current you's time. The ending is not the choice I would have made, but understand that some would do it differently. Very good movie. Good acting, good plot."
3,50's-60's area plus one cool futuristic motorcycle.,Acting ok. Bruce was good.For 2041 or whatever the year was meant to be. It just was not good in making me feel like it was in the future.
4,Looper,Good movie. I liked it the twist in it. My girl fell asleep though. Said it was a little confusing.
4,Good and Interesting Sci-Fi flick,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It has really good acting by some really good actors (Gordon_Levitt, Blunt) and the story is not your typical science fiction tale. The sound effects, music, and the sets all helped sell the story. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in science fiction or pseudo-Mob stories."
3,Not what it's hyped up to be,"It was a decent movie worth the watch, but it wasn't as well done as we had expected. Worthy rental if you don't have any other good movies you want to see."
3,Ending Didn't Make Sense,"I'm not a sci fi nerd or anything (ok, maybe I am...a little), but the ending didn't make much sense, even to me. Without giving anything away, let's just say that the end basically negates the entire movie. Otherwise, it was a neat idea with pretty sound acting. JGL NAILED Bruce Willis."
2,Did not like it,"Acting was flat, story line was garbled. I'm a Bruce Willis fan, which is why I rated it as high as I did."
2,Weak,"What a waste of money. The story tries so hard to explain the time travel ""looping"" connection, that the whole thing becomes convoluted and boring. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was excellent (but then again, he's a great young actor), but Bruce Willis looked very old and looked like he was sleep-walking through his part. If you're an Amazon Prime member (or a Netflix member), wait till it comes there - don't buy this movie."
2,waste of time,It is simply a bad movie. Boring and predictable plot full of bloody violence. It is not worth a rental.
2,Confusing Futuristic Story,"Not until the end is the point of the film revealed. Badly written and except for Willis, not very well-acted. Got nominated for an Oscar."
5,Looper: An incredible experience,"Looper is honestly one of the best-written films I've seen in a very long time.It's creative, fresh, and a new look at the age-old idea of time travel."
2,fair,fair worth the time if you don't have anything else to do.Thankfully you don't have to buy it. Go rental
2,movie was a let down.,"Typically this is my type of movie. Unfortunately, this movie did not work for me. I thought they could have done a lot more with all aspects of it."
2,violent and over the top weird,"This movie had alot going for it with ""Time Travel"" and a good plot. The first half of the movie was good, but as the movie went on, I felt like it just got weirder and weirder and the violence was over the top. I like a good movie with action etc, but this one I would pass on! The whole shooting children on movies is too weird and kinda sick to me."
2,Was disappointed,I was really excited about this movie only to be highly disappointed. I was hoping it would be more of a time travel thriller and was disappointed that time travel only happened once in the movie. The story line was a good concept that went wrong and came across as more cheesy then serious. I don't normally make fun of or laugh at movies like this but my husband and I found ourselves laughing at the end of the movie.Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives an amazing performance as well as Emily Blunt...if it weren't for the cheesy parts that made me laugh more than sympathize.
2,Some intense moments but average overall,"Too derivative and remindful of many other movies, like it borrowed from The Terminator, Back to the Future, Twelve Monkeys, Blade Runner, Inception, Scanners/Matilda/and even the Twilight Zone episode with Bill Mumy as the boy with special powers who can make dead the adults who annoy him. Bruce Willis' subdued performances are always his best, and this was another one. Quite good. Emily Blunt does very well coming across as a rural farm woman of the Plains -- not bad for an English actor! And the ending has a couple nice twists."
2,barely entertaining,"The idea and the concept are thought provoking, but the movie itself was yawnsville.Dont waste your time for basic entertainment or because you are a Bruce Willis fan, instead see it because you should make up your own mind. Some have found this movie to be great Sci Fi, but each of us geeks has our own flavor, unfortunately, this one did not match my tastes."
2,Not What I Hoped,So looked forward to seeing another Bruce Willis flick-so was a bit disappointed. Gordon-Levitt's character was flat and uninteresting. The plot was at times loosey goosey and the ending went flat.
4,Surprisingly Good,"I watched this because I like Bruce Willis, and he's always entertaining and I was bored. I was surprised that the premise of the film made a certain amount of sense to me and easily followed after the first ten minutes. It is science fiction and concerns time travel backward in time. The show is built on hit men who have completed their contract and given 30 years to live until they are eliminated. Bruce Willis really gives the movie substance with his flair for action films and the little boy in the film does a very credible job. All actors did a good job. I enjoyed it in spite of myself."
2,Dissapointing,"The Plot unravels in a slow, predictable manner. This movie would have been better for me if it was done in Frank Miller's style then it would have been better for me."
3,Not that good,"I read somewhere that this was a really good movie, and it looked interesting. I was disappointed. My husband watched it with me, and at the end, we both felt the same way. It was, at best, an okay movie."
2,Could have been better.,"Could have been much better, it's slow, very slow movie with not much of action or soul in it for Bruce Willis fans."
2,Too Long for weak premise,"The movie ""Looper"" has a weak but but interesting premise. One man meeting himself in the past and must kill his older self is worth about 30 minutes of my time."
4,Good,"Pretty cool movie except I dozed off for a bit in the middle, probably just tired. But the rest kept me entertained"
2,Ended badly,There is a lot of good to be said about this movie. The stars did a fairly nice job. I didn't like that they killed kids. And I didn't like how it ended.
3,Poorly written with huge holes,This time travel movie left so many questions but not about the puzzles of time travel. It was just poorly written and much of t he major story line was unexplored. Googling for explanation revealed that the writer/director did not know the answers either. Not really worth the time or the money.
3,Almost really good movie,"This movie could have been great - the story was fascinating, the acting was good across the board, the dialog was believable. The trouble was it fell into the trap of being so dark and brooding it was hard to like it completely. I get that the future is a dark, scarey place, I've been told that by many other near-future movies, and I'm tired of the message. In more skillful hands this could have been another Benjamin Button, instead it was vaguely unsatisfying. Too bad, because it had great promise. Still, it's not a terrible way to kill a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon."
2,Not sure what the critics like,It was pretty much a mess - not sure what the critics were watching - they seemed to see something arty farty but for me it was mildly entertaining but full of plot holes.
5,Fun Movie,Great movie - love the ending. Had not seen at theaters but heard a lot of good word of mouth on it. took a chance and it paid off.
3,Looper,"This kept going back and forth, past to future and could get confusing if you weren't paying total attention. It reminded me of something I've seen before, but frankly I don't remember what other movie it was. The ending was better than expected. I frequently lost attention so I kept reversing to catch what I missed. It has action and keeps moving forward, but it wasn't something I would want to watch again. It was ok. I think others would enjoy this and it's not bad. Some things could have been explained better, but that's just my opinion."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I half expected a Bruce Willis action movie, which definitely has its place- but this has some twists and turns, even a moral dilema! Bruce doesn't have a lot of lines, which may have helped..."
4,"Overall, A Good Thriller, But...","...I had the ending figured about somewhere around the halfway mark. I even paused the movie and told the kids I was going to send them an email with the ending so they could see I was right. Sure enough, i was right on almost all points of the ending. It's not so much that the movie is predictable... I can't explain it. Overall, it's a good thriller and it was entertaining enough I figure it was worth the cost of buying it to watch. My adult children both loved the show. It is one you want to pay attention to or it can get a little confusing when they start moving back and forth through time. Other than that, it's a good suspense thriller with a lot of action."
3,Looper,It was kind of corny scifi. Definitely not an action movie for my movie library. The plot was kind of redundant.
3,Ok movie,"It had it's action, but seemed to get off track somewhat and didn't know where it was going and then back"
2,Wanted to like this movie...but couldn't,"There were some interesting concepts, and potential storyline, but none of them came to fruition. A long movie without good plot or character development. Disappointing."
3,so-so,"not as good as all the hype. good actors, but story not good. and slow in places. sad that it wasnt better."
2,Ok,"Story had holes in it. It was just ok. Wouldn't pay much to see it. I like time traavel movies, but this one just wasn't that good."
5,Looper,I gave this movie 5 stars because I'm a huge Sci-fi fan and this movie also comes with a lot of action.
3,it's okay,interesting concept for a movie on time travel. The farm house was built very well to last over 125 years...
4,Looper,We enjoyed the movie. Was adventurous and filled with twists. Was easy to access. Would definitely watch it again. Thanks
3,A little slow,"Movie seemed really great from the previews, but was slow and had a pretty boring storyline. A little more complex storyline would greatly improve this movie."
3,Ok but not great,Watched Looper and had high hopes for it but thought the plot was only ok. Problems with time travel like many others that deal with this subject. Wished for a happier ending.
3,"Different, not great.","A little random, not enough time to really develope everything going on. At least I didn't pay to see it in the theater."
1,Save your time,This movie started out very promising and then just got strange. I recommend you save your time. This gets one star and that is for Bruce Willis alone.
1,Save yourself the time and read the wikipedia plot summary.,"[Sigh] Yet another time travel plot with too many ""loop"" holes. I actually rented this film, watched half of it and didn't get back to it before the 24hours expired. My wife convinced me to save the $4 of re-renting and just read the wikipedia summary. Good move. It's terrible, filled with holes, and will send your mind spinning in useless time travel circles. It would be great if hollywood would give up on the time travel genre. [...]"
1,Ridiculous movie,"Very disappointing, long, violent, stupid movie. Don't waste your time. It is confusing, hard to follow, gratuitous violence ridden, and without much plot. A disappointing offering from Bruce Willis, who is usually fun to watch."
1,"Bad timing, shallow script","I'm not a prude. I've seen plenty of violent movies. But it's hard to watch Looper without getting a strong sense that the script is peddling gratuitous violence as being somehow cool. From the opening frame all the way through, the bodies just keep stacking up.As a normal adult, I can compartmentalize what I'm watching. But I can't help but wonder though whether the more fragile in the world who watch this sort of stuff don't get bent by it.Maybe it's just bad timing on my part but I saw little to like about Looper. While they're out there trying to ban assault weapons, maybe it's time to open a dialog about movies like this one."
1,Don't bother watching Looper.,"I assure you that I'm not ruining it for you by saying the ending is as stupid as one could possibly imagine. It's really a film that leaves you wondering, through the whole thing, how it's going to turn out. Answer: It turns out really really stupid, as in ""Man, whoever wrote this was an idiot"" stupid. Not just disappointing. I mean ... why did this get to production stupid? How many Hollywood big-shots does it take to be really really stupid stupid. It's not a ""smart but confusing"" sci-fi film as the promoters describe it. It's confusing because it's wrong ... illogically wrong. The ending does not actually make any logical sense at all. No, that's not what would happen. It's just stupid."
3,Interesting concept,"Well, I liked the movie, though I did find the concept a bit odd. I can't imagine agreeing to allow myself to be killed, especially by my own hand. That was just hard for me to swallow. I also feel the idea of time travel could have been explored more, this movie would have benefited from more backstory."
2,Overrated,"Not a good movie. Boring plot, overdevelopment of noninteresting characters makes movie drag, only action scenes are simple gratuitous bloody violence. Not worth a rental. Found myself wanting the end of the movie about half way through, but held on to the end to see if it would get better. It didn't."
3,Time travel movies are a bit dodgy,"I spent the first 20 minutes of the video slightly confused by the concept of time travel put for by this movie. Then got ore confused at about half way in. Once I got past the ""loopy"" plot, I was able to enjoy the suspense and mystery. My advice would be not to worry too much about the time travel stuff making sense and just leave it all at face value."
4,Good movie!,"I had never heard of this movie before seeing it advertised on Amazon (yes I live under a rock) and I am Bruce Willis fan so I knew it would be decent. I was right! Very interesting plot and it ended totally different than I thought it would! This well worth the viewing, even if you only rent it (which I did). I will probably purchase it because it's worth watching more than once."
2,Odd and a bit Confusing,"This is just our family's collective opinion but it was an hour+ that we'll never get back. :( The trailer looked promising but at the end we were wondering why we had bothered. My dad said he was glad we saw it because he had planned to buy it and now new better. You might like it, just not us. Sorry."
2,"Good premise, too gritty","I like sci-fi/action/thriller, but this was a little to gritty/gruesome for me. If you're watching with a family, you may want to pass. However, cool ideas about time travel in the film, but I didn't finish it."
2,Disorganized and boring.,"This wasn't a very good movie because the plot was so disorganized, depressing, and contained too many redundant flashbacks. Most of the characters were annoying and pretentious. The sub-plot with the little boy and mother who have magical powers was interesting but that didn't save this movie from being really boring. Another disappointing aspect is that for a science fiction movie there wasn't a lot of science fiction. This isn't a classic like Blade Runner or Star Wars. Grade: C-"
2,Mediocre,Some of the worst makeup in any movie that I have ever seen. Joseph Gordon Levitt looks like a cross dresser who forgot to put on his high heals and mini skirt. The film moves oddly and the plot has way too many holes. It feels like a bunch of ideas all slapped together.
3,Looper,Not a great movie. Not something I would highly recommend. Best not to go to theaters to see movies nowadays as too expensive to see poor quality.
4,Good show,"This was a very good Movie. It had a lot more action than I expected. Some parts were a little hard to follow, but still worth a look. Would definitely recommend!"
3,Looper,Too much trouble with the movement between the present and the future. Hard to follow. Looper did have a good ending.
3,"Good Action, but hard to follow","Not one of Bruce Wilis's finest. Good action, but hard to follow the storyline as with many time travel narratives. The ending was too vague for my liking."
4,A solid movie choice,"If you're debating on watching it, just pull the trigger. The movie doesn't disappoint. Don't expect an Oscar worthy story line, but the movie keeps you engaged throughout. Think of Inception with one less layer of reality."
4,good storyline,"Pretty good movie, not a large amount of action but good story line and a pretty predictable ending. Would watch it again and recommend it to a friend."
4,"Flaws like any time travel movie, but minimal.","Makes you think, but not to the point where it gives you a migraine (a la Inception). Tremendous actingby Levitt and Willis."
4,Good Time Travel Flick,"I liked the twists, the violence is a bit much but fits the story. I like time travel stories and this one has a different take."
5,great movie,i liked it a lot. Interesting sci-fi movie. My wife usually doesn't like action movies but she approved of this one.
2,Meh,Garbage. Not enough story about the loop. No resolution on what happens when the past is changed. Characters are good story sucked.
3,As per the star rating......It's okay,"Okay plot. Okay acting. Entertaining. Some interesting twists on time travel. Happy I watched it, but wouldn't watch it twice."
3,Slow to develop,Although there is action right from the start the best part really centers around the farm. Video quality is only fair when you are accustomed to watching action movies in blu ray
2,"Good movie, bad quality","While the movie was fairly interesting, the quality of the HD is horrible. Don't waste your money on the upgrade."
2,2 stars thats it,Toys movie get 2 stars for 2 A list stars. Movie sucked huevos if you know what that means. Slow and slower and slowly bored you but not too death
3,Very watchable movie,"I was just looking to kill time on a weekend and this movie was definitely worth the money. Action packed, has an interesting plot and twists. Why just three stars - well I don't give more than 3 stars to a movie I won't watch a second time"
3,Different than Expected,"Couldn't wait to see it but even though it was different than I expected, but it was still ok to watch once."
4,good stuff,This movie was worth watching once. There were no typical BW moments. The ending became obvious a little to early in the movie.
3,Fairly good movie but,"The plot wasn't bad but the quality of the sound was poor, kept having to increase/decrease the sound the entire movie."
4,Mindbending Thrill Ride,This movie kept me glued to the screen waiting to see how this would turn out. It was entertaining and full of twists. If you like action adventure movies this has it all.
2,fails to live up to its potential,fails to live up to its potential. Then turns into something else. Could have developed more. cool effects. cool idea
3,Eh..,"If I am going to pick one thing to rave about in this movie it's Gordon-Levitt. He matched his facial expressions,mannerisms and voice inflection to Bruce Willis so closely that I was (once again) blown away by his talent. The story is alright, the supporting cast is decent. Not amazing sci-fi, even though the concept was decent, the application was lacking. I'm not mad that I watched it, so there's that."
4,Good but could have been better,"The movie is an interesting concept. The main character doesn't have much of a redeemable quality and I never really connected to him. The younger actor does do a good job of looking like his future self. It was a ""darker"" film with the portrayal of drug use, violence, language. Not a good movie for kids or wives who don't like violent movies. Glad I didn't go to the theater to see this but I did enjoy it."
4,I like it,"Good basic entertainment...not a ""Barn Burner,"" but good entertainment. The ending was interesting and provided a good conclusion to the ""Time Travel"" concept."
4,Unique time travel based action; moderately entertaining if you don't ask too much of it; missing detail and overly simple,"Unique time travel based action; very enjoyable if you just try to enjoy it for what it is - entertainment. I do wish it had made the viewer think deeper, but it simply isn't that kind of movie. Good delivery by actors helps, but doesn't quite close the story line which seems to be cut short and void of detail; again very simplified storyline made into a movie; could have done a better job with more time and effort"
4,Good not great movie,Interesting premise but i found myself being bored at parts of it. Decent ending though and i did buy the kid as Bruce Willis for the most part much more than i thought i would
3,Suspenseful,Odd concept but held my attention. Not sure if I would recommend this. Little too out there for my taste
3,Glad I didn't spend money seeing this in a theater,The movie was just so-so for me. Not sure whether or not the sound was purposely done to extremes but it was annoying having to always have my finger on the volume button. Some dialog had to be turned way up to hear then BAM the gunshot or other action would be extremely loud and I would have to run the volume way down.
4,great movie,"This movie is right up there with the classic time travel flicks like terminator and back to the future. good acting, believable action sequences, intriguing plot. Still, there are only so many ways to spin the time travel plot, so even though it was excellent, it's not going to make history in my book."
4,Very enjoyable,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie but the trailer looked good enough to give it a try.I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. The story was very interesting if a little unbelievable, and by that I mean why is it the criminals have access to the technology and not the military. Seemed very odd. Still it was enjoyable and I personally liked the ending, not quite what I expected. Well worth a watch."
4,VERY GOOD,"I really like Bruce Willis, he is a great actor, I think I may purchase this DVD so that I can watch it again, and again"
3,"Great acting, engaging action, unexpected surprised but CONFUSING plot!","OK I admit, time-travel films are hard to grasp but I am also relatively intelligent. However, even if you dismiss me, my husband is a freaking genius AND a film junkie so we both could not demystify the plot. It was good. It was enjoyable. there was no way I would have not finished watching it and I have no issues stopping films half-way if they are going to waste my time but alas, I am still not happy with how it all ended. But it had Bruce Willis so really, why am I complaining? :)"
1,I wish I could go back in time and not watch this movie.,"A lot of build up for very little pay off. The idea of meeting a future version of oneself is ripe with possibilities, but this film just doesn't get there. Levitt is great though and his performance makes his young Willis more believable, even though the make up is a bit distracting."
1,Violent and derivative,"If you want a movie that, regardless of its sappy final message, glorifies violence, mass killings and assault weapons, this is for you. Take Terminator, remove the characters you care about, throw in a pinch of The Omen and a strong dash of Quentin Tarantino's films (without the style and humor), and you know exactly what kind of movies this young writer/director was raised on. All in all, depressing."
1,One of the worst movie of the year,"Just another mindless, meaningless, pointless, killing spree from Hollywood with absurd and violent story and nothing to tell... Don't waste precious time on this garbage. Another flop from Hollywood desperate for good story."
1,Boring,"A neat idea for a movie, but it just falls apart. Rather than explain time travel and certain paradoxes, we are basically told not to think about it. I assume it was too much trouble for the writer to figure out a good explanation of how the movie makes little sense.In comes the typical strange child halfway through the movie. I wound up not caring about any of the characters by the end.The worst part was how boring the movie was and slow-paced . z. .. z. z.. I just expected a bit more."
2,Too complicated,Directors try to make these movies too complicated. The intent seems to be how they can out do other movies in trying to show their breadth of imagination. I just want a plot and the movie to surround it.
1,Awesome Movie,"We loved the movie, but the streaming quality was the worst we have ever had.I watch movies from HULU and Netflix all the time and I never have quality issues."
1,Too dark and incomprehensible audio.,"It was too dark to see properly for many scenes, it was almost impossible to hear and/or understand the mumbling speech, and the cutting back and forth from future to present was very confusing. Sorry I ever paid for it especially since I stopped watching after one hour in."
1,looper,Looper the movie sucked the action sucked Bruce willis sucked what you want me to write a book on how bab this movie looper sucked
3,Looper Movie Rental,"This movie was good. Bruce Willis was his normal great-acting self. The story line was a bit odd. I'm glad we rented this movie, but we probably would not wish to see it again. One time is good, no need for two."
4,interesting movie,Good movie keeps you thinking throughout the whole movie. It did take a little longer than I thought to get here.
3,A lot of creative license with time line.,"It could have been better. . . a few loose ends, and crative license with time of events....its time travel so it seems they didn't think explaining the sequences was important enough. Not too bad though."
4,Sometimes a little confusing,Like my title states: sometimes a little confusing but it works itself out. Good performances by all & makes you think.
2,"It was pretty decent, not what I expected","I have heard a lot of great things about this movie and I couldnt wait to see it, It started out great and kept getting better, until his future self was there then it kind of got messy in my opinion, Worth the 3.99 but that is about it i guess"
3,A little better than your typical time travel movie,Action was good... hard to follow at times. I did enjoy the movie but the ending left me wanting more and when it was over I was like 'that's it?'
3,Interesting,"Interesting story, but a bit draggy and confusing at times. The performances were strong though and overall I enjoyed it."
3,Decent Movie,I wish it had a little more action I just expected more from watching the previews but overall it was a decent film.
4,Intense and Intriguing,"Caution: This is a violent movie... (as if you couldn't tell;) However, the most upsetting loss of life is not taken without sadness or regret. This is a fast paced movie, with an interesting concept and has a lot going on... you may want to watch it more than once."
4,Solid 4 Stars Here!,"This movie was a little better than I thought It was gonna be. I saw all of the peoplewho gave the movie 1 star, which now after seeing it for myself, 1 start is quite ridiculous.The story line is very original!There are lots of plot twists.The movie is interesting from the beginning all the way to the end.And the ending was very good.The ending was different.It was UN expected.A really good 4 star movie here."
3,"Clever, a good watch, but....may contain spoilers",I had the premise of this movie before we rented it. The writing and plot were well written and portrayed. The only problem is that the concluding plot point which was only hinted at at the beginning of the movie was severely underdeveloped. Once you see the last 20 minutes you will get my point on this.
3,Not as good as promised,"I'm a big fan of time travel stories and movies (and probably saw all of them!).""Looper"" has a few interesting original aspects: what happens to your older self when someone affects the younger version (well done in the movie), for instance, levitation...The first half of the movie sets the context and environment. Even people having no clue about what time travel can be should figure out pretty clearly what's happening, what a ""looper"" is, why are they ""looping"", what is ""closing a loop"" etc... Also, we learn that people in the future (2044) evolved and developed a sense of levitation.I liked the first half. In the second half, without revealing too much of the plot, there are a few overlong passages where the writers couldn't get the best from the original ideas developed in the 1st part.All in all, this is a watchable movie.If it is your first time-travel movie, you will probably enjoy it more than me.Otherwise you may end up a bit disappointed."
4,"Was entertaining, but I didn't like the ending...","I guess I figured there was just one way this movie could go at the end, but I still didn't like it. Otherwise, the movie was entertaining. It moved at a good clip and had a fair amount of action. It did, however, drag from time to time and the flashbacks, flashforwards, and dream sequences made it confusing to watch at times. I also thought that WAY too much make up was used on Gordon-Levitt who just looked comical in many scenes. Not sure what that was all about."
4,A great Sci-Fi movie,"Time travel, big guns, and a will he or won't he plot this is a must see. I would recommend this movie for people who like action or Sci-Fi movies."
1,The disk is cracked in the middle and does not play,The disk won't play and it is beyond the return policy date. I would like another DVD to replace this item.
2,I wouldn't watch it even once,"I'm a si-fier. Love time travel movies. Action movies arein my blood. This movie is terrible, not worth watching.I won't spoil it for those who are going to watch it,when it finally ended, I went uuuugh."
4,Cool action flick,"OK, the time-travel premise is pretty thin. The script invites you to stop thinking about it and get on with the plot. Which itself is pretty thin: Gordon-Levitt's character Joe, without knowing it, is assigned to kill his future self (Willis as Old Joe). Willis thinks this is a bad idea. He's already gotten rid of the team sending him back to be killed, and isn't about to put up with any fuss from a puppy half his age - not even himself.From there, the chase is on. Joe is in deep poo with the criminal organization for failing to complete the assignment. The criminal organization is in deep poo with Old Joe for messing up his future life. Needless to say, the criminal organization fares badly against a massively peeved Willis.It's an enjoyable action flick with a few surprises, including the final one. A good script and great performances save it from the basic inanity of its premises. Still, it's commodity entertainment and utterly forgettable.-- wiredweird"
1,Not as good as previews,Can't say this movie was all that riveting or even worth 2 hours of your life. I just found the movie a huge disappointment and well wish spent my 5 dollars at Five guys.
1,LOOPER is loopy!,There wasn't much of a plot. I had trouble watching the entire thing. It will be in my collection but I probably won't watch it again.
1,What special effects?,"I could always count on Bruce Willis movies being good.What happened here? Awful movie!Are you listening, Bruce?Now I can't."
2,Not a good movie,Trailer looked like it would be good. Trailer had all the best of the whole movie. thank goodness it cost me only $4.
2,Tries to be too much,"While I love time travel movies, I found Looper to be unfocused and trying to be too much. As if time travel is not enough, for some reason it goes the direction of Heroes, which loses focus on the main topic. Character development is marginal so I found myself not caring too much about what happens in the end.Best time travel movie ever: Primer (2004). [...]"
2,Stupid,"Don't waist your time. I rented this on a weekend to waist some time and after watching it, I would like that time back."
2,bad movie,very stupid and confusing plot that I couldn't follow very well. I think Bruce has seen better days. Watch something else
4,I was very..,I was very happy to watch the movie for the 1st time and I loved it and it was one of those movies that you think about. You want to know what I mean buy it or rent it and you will see what I mean by that.
5,excellent,"this is an excellent movie. The whole while i was watching it, i could help but feel so old. I remember the star of this movie as the little smart mouthed kid from 3rd rock from the sun... not look at him"
3,Need to pay attention ...,"This is an enjoyable movie with some good acting. Good to see Emily Blunt in a heroine action role.It starts slowly and I found I was struggling to concentrate. However, by halfway through the pace had picked up and then was a thrilling ride to the end. Good special effects, clever concept using time-travel and very good acting.One key issue for me was I didn't believe Old Joe and Young Joe were the same person, just 30 years different in age. I think the director should have aged Gordon-Levitt so he could play both the old and young Joe. Would have made it a little crazier too, seeing two similar looking dudes shooting it out.Liked the idea of Emily Blunt's young son and the power he possessed.Good ending, if a little predictable."
3,Typical Hollywood,I thought this movie was going to be original or have lots of twists. Well it wasn't and it didn't. It was OK. I liked the ending but the build up and development was just OK.
3,Good story,"I had great expectation for the movie and that was a problem for me. A good movie with a very interesting but crazy idea! THe story unfolds slowly, which keeps you wanting to see more but at the end it is a surprise!"
5,Bruce Willis Is Back!,"This sci-fi action film is outstanding! Bruce Willis nails it! The plot is very engrossing and imaginative, but it is Bruce Willis' performance that makes this film work. This film was a magnificent surprise! It blew me away! The edge of your seat action and suspense were just too incredible for words! This is another must-see film!"
4,Good movie,Not my kind of movie but was good. I couldn't stop watching because I was afraid I would miss something.
4,Worth watchn,Had real good story. Just didn't like the ending the story started with and ending and then left story open at the end.
3,Not as exciting as previous Bruce Willis movies.,"I liked the movie somewhat because of it's sci-fi, time-loop nature. Very slow at first, and didn't really pick up much later. Not a lot of action as in other Bruce Willis movies, but the story plot was pretty good. Some of the dialogue was pretty lame, but it still worked. Basic time-loop story and how to break the loop so time is permanently altered."
2,too much,Blah..a lot going on...I hate movies that are being narrated. Love Bruce though :) I doubt there's a loopers 2
2,Wasn't my kind of movie,"Besides being slow, the download kept messing up and finally had to give up on it--but never went back to it before the 24 hours was over--a waste of $3.99"
4,Good movie,Do not really care much for Bruce Willis but this was actually a good movie even with him in it.
3,Review,It was just ok but fell short of my expectations. It seemed to drag in certain parts of the movie.
4,Interesting,I loved the concept. It's interesting to talk about with friends since we would all have differing opinions. Definitely worth watching. Makes you think.
5,Worth the time,A good fantasy tale about time travel that has a few inconsistency but well worth it. Make up is exceptional.
3,"Dark, odd movie","The characters were just not very sympathetic or interesting. There was some action, some comedy, some drama... but mostly it was just dark. Did not really care for it but others might like the twists."
3,Not BW&#699;s best but good for JGL,"Not particularly a big sci-fi fan, however the character acting by JGL was very good. He got all of BW&#699;s expressions and mannerisms down. JGL has a lot going for him as a character actor. BW has definitely done better in other action roles as a cocky hard talking old timer action star. The plot definitely plays to the title ""Looper"", but the overstatement of other details in the movie is distracting and doesn&#699;t tie in well together."
3,There is a sound problem,it starts with a good way. Middle of the movie is really boring. End of the story is also good. From beginning to end worst thing about the movie is sound. If someone talks you can not hear but effects are too loud. All I can say i am glad i did not watch it at movie theatre.
3,ok.....,Kind of a confusing movie. My husband liked it more than me. I would have preferred to rent this from the red box instead.
3,transmission issues,I downloaded the program from amazon and the program timed out twice and the quality of the image was poor.
2,Two different plots smashed together makes a disappointing movie,"This movie had promise, but ended up being a strange, mashed-together film that felt like two different movie scripts rammed together incoherently. The film starts out as a time-travel, sci-fi flick, slowly building it's premise, and then...bang: a whole new plot about a demonic child who explodes people begins almost out of thin air.My friends and I looked at each other when this second plot began with looks of ""what the....?"" The entire ""child as deranged killer"" thing just didn't fit the premise of the first half of the film and was somewhat distasteful. I honestly think the writers had written two different versions of the film, and then rammed them together. This film doesn't know if it wants to be a sci-fi film or a horror film, and in trying to be both, it fails."
2,Looper,"Yes. Its not worth and of orderingIt, very confusing plot, hard to follow,Actions with Bruce Willis areGood, that's about it,wantedTo see it back, but what do uGive as reason,it sucks!!"
2,Not Good,This movie was confusing and predictable. Also they did a werid effect with Joseph Gordon-Levitt face to make it look like Bruce Willis. I would skip it.
2,Poor Atmosphere,"Poor atmosphere, normally I like time travel themes, but I don't care how this one was handled. The writers could not make up their minds about what time conventions they wanted to use- single timeline, vs multiple time lines. I think they used both. Bottom line, it did not click for me."
3,just ok,This movie was ok. Had some really sad parts including shooting a child. Not approprite for young children..not even close
2,Did I fall asleep?,"With the quality of the actors in this movie, as well as the action packed trailers, I was sorely disappointed in this movie. This movie had so much potential, yet it failed to deliver. Why? The acting was good, but the plot was dismal. I found myself several times wondering what was going on, and why? There is no value in this movie. Some day in the future, the actors will look back on this film and ask themselves, ""did I need the money that bad?""."
2,Looper,"The trailer I saw portrayed a lot more action. I also felt as they didn't really bother to explain a lot of what was going on, I feel as a lot of the movie could have been cut out all together while adding to certain elements, the best way I can think to describe it without giving away plot is to call it a long-short film. It was drawn out in many parts that felt unnecessary while key plot points where barley touched. I didn't like it."
2,looper,"we did not like this movie. it was very confusing 2 thirds of the way thru. we really like bruce but the last movie he made we liked was ""reds"" great movie and they are making reds 2 out in 2013 cant wait!!!"
4,Fun film,I enjoyed this movie. A fun popcorn flick. They did a good job with the makeup. I was not disappointed.
4,Lots of fun - not what I was expecting,"The movie ends up being a much different film than the trailers led me to believe, which is a really good thing."
2,"The movie was great, Amazon HD was terrible",For $5 I expect the quality of Amazon HD to be better than what I could torrent. It was awful. Get a Netflix subscription and rent a Blu-ray if you want a the best HD experience.
4,A thinking mans Bruce Willis movie,"An amazing movie about time travel you have to think about. The ending was awesome. The story was great. I loved that it isn't a typical ""hollywood"" closure."
3,Looper,Too many hypothetical scenarios! Could be better! I should have waited so I would not have to spend money to see this movie
3,Just ok,"Simply that. Just ok! Never felt very connected to the characters and the story was simply not that compelling. The sound was out of sync with the lip movement. I left and came back two additional time to try to fix the problem, but no success."
3,problems,"Amazon refunded our charge so I have no complaint. The film was entertaining and creative.We had transmission problems with constant loading and freezing, also poor visual quality. Otherwise, I would have given the film a higher rating."
3,"Good premise, but poor editing and bad ending.","The movie sets up well: people in the future kill others by sending them back to the past to be shot and incinerated by contracted killers. Problem is it looks much better in theory than application. Acting in the movie is okay, but the overall story has too many problems. Bruce Willis was pretty decent, but his younger version was acted unevenly. Film editing was poor:Young Willis is right-handed while old Willis is left-handed.Someone is shot in the neck in one scene, but OK in the following scene.If I could I would give the movie two-and-a-half stars."
2,been there done that,While I was hoping for something more I am sorry to say it did not come. This is a 159 minute movie that should have been a 93 minute movie. If not for Bruce Willis would have tuned it off after the first fifteen minutes. Save your money and wait for a really good movie.
3,Don't believe the Hype,"This film is a decent action film, but most of the reviews I've seen have hailed it as a return to intelligent sci-fi and that is patiently not the case. Perhaps I'm a bit jaded, having been spoiled by some of the better Time Traveler movies of the past two decades with films like Primer, Time Crimes, and Twelve Monkeys. By comparison, Looper seems to feature a lazy attempt at world building with numerous plot holes. Performance wise, however, this film features some fine acting from all the leads, two of whom happen to play the same person. Emily Blunt is particularly believable in her role, which seemed to veer significantly from her usual fare. This a good popcorn movie, but I'd definitely rent it before you buy it outright."
2,"Good, but I fell asleep","The part of the movie I saw was alright, but I fell asleep because it just wasn't all that great."
5,Great movie,Great movie to watch. Had low expectation prior to watching it but was very entertained throughout the entire movie. Great plot lines
3,Kind of entertaining if you don't think about it,"It's nicely filmed and well acted, but the story collapses under its own internal logic. If you're going to tell a time-travel story, you'd better work out the paradoxes in a satisfying way or the whole thing will unravel as soon as the closing credits begin. Unfortunately, that's what happens here. If you think about it even a little bit, you realize that the story just couldn't have gone the way it did, given what happens at the end. I can't go into detail without including spoilers which would ruin the movie for anyone who reads this and still cares to watch it."
3,"Entertaining, but not too deep","It's somewhat convoluted without fully fleshing out how the time travel timeline works , but all around an entertaining movie."
2,"Long, violent, boring, tragic beginning, middle and end.",My title pretty much sums it up without giving away too much of the plot. Worst Bruce Willis movie I have ever seen.
3,it was okay,"The usual 'shoot 'em up' movie...getting pretty fed up with these type of movies,as well as all the 'zombie' movies"
2,Waste of movie night,"The idea was interesting, but it was overly graphic. Sad how movies are all about fitting in the gore and sex, but focus so little on quality now."
1,Confusing and not what I would watch again,Hard to hear dialog then would get drowned out by music and sound effects dog dog dog dog dog dog
1,Horrible Movie,"The whole premiss of the movie is that the mob can't kill people in the future and must send them 30 years into the past to have them killed by Loopers. However, future Looper (Bruce Willis) comes back to kill the head of the Mob as a child because his wife was murdered by the mob in the future. So if the mob can kill his wife in the future, then it throws the whole idea of needing Loopers out. This seemly simple plot error, ruined the whole movie."
1,total waste of time,"premise unbelievable, plot discombulated. Bruce Willis must have owed the producers a favor. Should have done my due diligence before ordering"
1,A sick and twisted film,"Looper was simply a movie with perverse, gratuitous violence. Think of it as a horrible combination of T ime Cop meats Soylent Green."
1,yuck,"I didn't even begin to like the characters, no reason to. No reason to keep watching a bunch of people get shot."
1,Movie Good -- UltraViolet Bad,"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie in the theatre and was looking foreward to the home/mobile experience and maybe even some of the director commentary. However. The process of having to set up x2 Sony Accounts w/ passwords link the accounts then for the iOS download, install and set up another account with another password and unscucessfully link the Flixster account to the linked up UV account.Never got there. So frustrated with the process that I deleted the iOS app and just shut down the UV account w/ the promise to not get any more product with this ""Feature"""
3,"HAS FLAWS BUT IF YOU LIKE SIFI, DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING","AS WITH MOST SIFI, IT HAS SOME PLOT FLAWS, BUT IT'S WELL ACTED AND FUN TO WATCH, SO I WOULD/DO RECOMMEND IT TO ANY SIFI FANS. IT'S NOT GOING TO KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING."
4,Great movie!,"Really enjoyed this movie, the time travel aspect was explained well and the story kept me interested the entire movie."
3,"Good action, story was not completely original","Enjoyed the action in the movie and the overall fast pace of the film. However, some elements had been explored before (time trival, demon child, etc.)."
3,time travel,"This one was ok. The movie will keep you entertained but it is not something you will be talking about with your' buddies. All in all I found it entertaining enough and worth the $3.99 I paid. If I had gone to the movies and paid those RIDICULOUS PRICES, I would not be so kind :)"
3,Interesting concept,I thought this movie had a fairly engaging storyline and Gordon-Levit reallt did a great job recreating Bruce Willis' facial expressions. Great rental not sure I would add this to my collection.
3,dark in more ways than one,"Not only is the cinematography dark, the plot is as well. Actually it is a good premise and one that has been around for many years, in one form or another. Reminds me of my days devouring Analog SciFi/Fantasy. However, to the novice, the plot is very hard to follow. Fortunately enough reviews are available to work out the plot in general terms. The ending is actually rather predictable to veteran Sci Fi buffs, but the flashbacks and odd interactions make following along a challenge. This is one of those movies I wish had been executed better. The failing may be in the editing or just put it on the director's shoulders. The action needs to be clear and not just reliant on shotgun gblasts."
1,amazon video streaming problems,I liked the movie though i was confused about the end a bigWhat I had a problem with was the amazon video service dropping out several times throughout the viewing. I have a very good fios connection and I had to restart the video several times as well as wait for buffering 7 or 8 times. Very frustrating experience.
1,Close this Loop,"Yeah this is a mess of a movie. It sets up many rules only to drop them at the earliest convenience. It's hard not to spoil the movie and make my points. I found it the work of an auteur out of control or at least surrounded by ""Yes"" men. The script is atrocious and the one hit premise of chasing down your future self could have been cool, but the muddled time travel and crowded suspended of disbelief is stretched too thin, especially when we're dealing with ""TK"" sensitive people as well. It looks kinda nice at times, but the logic of the story and world doesn't hold together no matter how ""cool"" the movie thinks it is."
3,Not a bad movie but I probably wont watch again,Not a bad movie. Not as action packed as I would have thought. The ending was good but left a lot of questions. I probably wont watch again
3,Not what I thought it would be,Bruce was good but not one of his better movies. Had pretty high expectations I guess and it just wasn't there.
2,Ehh what..,Sadly this movie I thought would be fun to watch but. For me it became more predictable and sadly that says it all. It really didnt go in debt with the characters. I like plot stories so if the story is predicable then the characters debt sometimes help really carry the movie balancing it out. It really didnt.
3,Interesting concept,I thought this movie was okay. It was more violent then I thought. I believe it would be more instesting if you're a big science fiction fan or Bruce Willis fan! :)
4,Looper was Unique!,"At first I thought, ""what the heck"" and wasn't sure I made a good choice, but as the film went on it grew on me. By the end I was very glad I rented the movie."
4,Nice twist!,"It's tough to come up with something unique when making a time travel movie - but they did it. Watch this movie - you'll dig it!!**spoiler alert** - although, it is a bit puzzling to wonder why they didn't just ""loop"" the bad guys directly into the incinerator to avoid all the potential liability."
5,Good Thinking Movie,"Just when you think you know what to expect with a time travel movie, along comes Looper and really blows your mind. I found this movie both exciting and intelligent. I would highly recommend it."
5,Looper,Great original movie. Bruce Willis is 2012 - 2013 actor of the decade. He is not showing any signs of slowing down either. Joseph Gorden-Levitt is also one of the busiest actors in Holly Wood also. I especially loved the way they let you make up your own mind about what really happened.
1,I have had less painful root canals,A total waste of time (no pun intended). Story flow could have been better and inconstantcies should have been avoided.
1,don't waste your time,I cannot believe that Bruce Willis did this crap. What a waste of time and money. Bruce was good but the story was aweful
1,Many plot holes,The story was a good idea and had escellent actors. I found the writing to be sub-par at best. The movie is fine if you don't think at all while you are watching it.
3,Joseph Gordon Levitt's makeup was a bit weird,The storyline was a bit confusing but very creative. Joseph Gordon Levitt's makeup intended to have him look like a young Bruce Willis but was a bit odd to watch!
5,Loved this show,"Great show, several unexpected plot twists and turns on a fairly standard sci-fi premise. Good character development and fairly good flow of the movie."
3,"Eh, it was OK",I can't say this was a great movie and I usually like everything time travel. But it's interesting to watch if you have nothing better to do.
3,"3 1/2 stars , Rent not Buy","Slow Slow Slow. Interesting story plot. There is some good action at the end, but over all it just is missing something and could have capitalized on the plot more. Not a bad movie and worth a rent, but not to own. It def has some missed opportunities in it."
5,A lot of twists and turns!,"I love films that make me think, and want to watch again to make sure I figured it out right! This one did just that!"
2,Boring,It was just one of those movies where you didn't really end up with any feeling towards any of the characters which made it difficult to get into.
3,Not as good as the hype,This movie was supposed to be awesome; the best time travel/science fiction movie in a long time. I thought it was merely an ok action flick. I hated the make-up they put on Joseph Gordon-Levitt; I found it very distracting and completely unnecessary.
4,Not bad...,"Not a bad movie, but very slow at times...Wish it had more special effects like other Bruce Willis' movies. Any takers?"
2,So So Sci-Fi,"Story undeveloped, violence senseless, no direction. I was waiting till the end of the movie for it to improve. It didn't. Most unfortunately, you had to wait till the end to find out one small piece of the puzzle, the rest was mishmash."
2,Film is decent.,"The film is pretty good, but I hope they fire the guy that decided to use ultraviolet instead of digital copy."
2,Not good,Didn't enjoy this movie. I wish it could of had a better ending. Bruce dies come on. Worst movie ever
2,less than mediocre,"I didn't like this movie. I rented it because I generally like Bruce and his part was OK, the young guy left me cold and sort of disinterested."
2,Fairly unoriginal,"This film contained a good dose of action and some suspense, but overall it featured a mediocre, unoriginal plot. Some of the scenes (assassinations of bound and hooded prisoners) were a bit disturbing."
3,More hype than substance,"I heard this was one of the better recent sc-fi movies and it is not bad.Not nearly as good as many peeps are saying but worth a rental. What prevents this movie from being more than it is, is Gordon-Levitt. He is just too wooden in this role and there is no emotional appeal there It sad when sub par actors just get the roles, Like they said about Russell Crowe in Les Mis, you can say the same thing about Joesph."
2,"Basically, it was stupid","They tried hard to produce to produce a good film but I just couldn't buy into the whole time travel thing. None of the characters is likeable, even the little boy. It was a bit disturbing, also."
3,Overhyped,"Heard all about ""Looper"" being possibly the best time travel movie ever. Well, it was relatively entertaining, but ultimately fell well short of my expectations. It was a decent sci-fi flick that kept my attention for the full two hours, but I can't say much more. I mostly enjoyed guessing at how everything was going to work out in the end."
3,Did not live up to the hype,I thought it would be much better based on the reviews in Rotten Tomatoes. None of the characters were truly likeable.
5,A Must See!!!,"Everybody is entitled to their opinion but to say this movie is one of the worst movie ever, that's just utter nonsense (As some of the reviews say). In fact, this movie is brilliant from start to finish. Everything is interconnected, well thought-out, and the ending is beyond what I could ever wish for. The last time I was so amazed by the ending was in ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable""."
2,A lot of hype,"So I like Sci-Fi movies, but I got confused at one point but went with it hoping it would get more clear, but then stopped caring.The movie did not feel important enough to care about any of the characters. The character development was basically created in flashbacks if you need an example. I also felt making Joseph-Gordon Levitt look like Bruce Willis was very distracting, he looked strange, sometimes it looked like he had lipstick on. I don't really recommend this movie."
5,Looper is a fantastic movie,If you are a big fan of scence fictioni and action movies this movie is right up your alley. Looper has a great story with fantastic performances by both Bruce Willis and Joseph-Gordon Leavitt. The blue ray looks great on my HD tv. In my opinion this movie is worth the money. I have watched it five times since I purchased it a month ago.
5,Great Movie!,"Oh, I will have to watch this again to get everything. This movie is like Vanilla Sky, you have to really pay attention, but it is worth it."
5,Awesome !! Loved it !!,Very imaginative !! Bruce Willis shines !! One of the best time travel movies since 12 Monkeys ! Good quality Sci Fi !!
2,"Started great, No Ending",So I am not going to write a spoiler review. I will only say that the story started very interesting. It goes way beyond what the trailer portrays. There is great buildup and suspense. The ending sucked and didn't make any sense.
3,"Interesting concept, poorly executed","I think it is a great action film that slightly confuses you or intrigues you I should say, but the ending is not right and it seems that they are trying to hard to make it confusing that the plot doesn't actually exist! It's worth renting I would say, but don't get too excited"
2,Disappointing and Makes No Sense,"The movie didn't even make sense if you really want to dig into the ""plot"". It was quite silly. Overall, the acting and graphics were the only thing keeping this film alive."
3,A bit slow,I thought the movie was a bit slow. It picked up later on but I didn't think it was that good.
3,Ho Hummm!,Nothing to write home about! Would not recommend this to anyone and will probablybe selling at my next garage sale!
3,not terrible but not very good,"This movie was mediocre, I lost interest about halfway though it and I guess that's about it. Be nice to a truck driver today, we keep America moving."
2,Waste of my 4 dollars.,"I would rather watch a rerun of Dance Moms than this horrible story. Movie is fun all the way until the 2nd act and then it goes tits up from there and turns into a weird version of ""Signs"" and ""Chronicle""."
3,No spanish subtitles,"I'm sad because it was my first amazon video rent, and it didnt had any of the normal dvd/bluray menus.. there wasnt an option to select languajes, scenes or special features.. this disapoints me of amazon."
2,Plot is beyond belief,Skip it. The premise that the same person can exist twice in the same time was too difficult for me to accept. I understand that the movie is science fiction but this goes too far.
2,Way too violent...,"Great actors, but altogether way too much violence. there was someone being executed avery few minutes it seemed. I understand that's the story line, but there's no way I would have rented it if I'd known how absolutely sickening it was."
3,"Entertaining to watch, pretty lame and thin plot","I'll watch most things sci-fi, so therefore it gets a 3 from me - would give it a 2 otherwsie. There were hardly any surprises in this film and the acting was just so-so. The premise (send people to the past for execution) was preposterous."
2,Waste of money,"The movie Looper could have been a much better movie. Boring plot, over-development of noninteresting characters makes movie drag,on and on."
5,"Surprisingly Imaginative, Philosophical","I was so hopelessly/annoyingly confused after 20 minutes that I thought I wouldnt finish it, but as I began to see where they're going with the story, the unusual take reeled me in. The acting is great in a sci-fi time-travel flic; a genre i usually turn off to. This had some edgy, imaginative - if not stoner - logic that once I got onboard with, found a gripping, touching and thought-provoking plot line. SPOILER: Think along the lines of Keannu Reeves killing himself at the end of Devil's Advocate."
3,Watchable but not suspenseful,"Somewhat surprised by all the critics acclaim. The movie is not too bad, but often slow and sometimes plain boring."
3,Good,Did not think it was as good as the last ones but worth watching. Just not as funny but the story was good.
3,Don't think about it too much,"Like most time travel movies, you can't think about it too much or it all falls apart. Other than that, the movie is okay."
3,Interesting movie involving time travel.,"If you like 12 Monkeys, Terminator, Back to the Future, or any other time travel movie you will probably find this interesting. Not great, but not bad."
2,skip it,"not a good movie. unless you are just a big Bruce Willis fan, skip this one, Even the story is bad."
2,Didn't live up to the hype,Other folks reviewed this and said it was wonderful. I like sci-fi and time-travel so I thought I'd enjoy it. It was just violence loosely masquerading as sci-fi.
3,Tries to be something it's not,I just felt like the movie tried to cash in on the Inception hype. I felt like everything about this movie was overrated. You need to watch the movie with just the mindset that it is an action movie and you can't over-think the plot.
3,Looper movie,"A fair science fiction movie with a novel plot. A bit slow moving to start, but the premise developes quickly after that."
3,Meh,I rented this because I heard some great reviews on the radio. I like sci-fi. I like time travel movies. But the trick to a good time travel movie is to not leave any gaps in the sequences...big gaps in this movie that really needed a clever fix.
3,"entertaining, but...",check your logic at the door. The time/space continuum conundrum in anything related to time travel is tricky to keep consistent...
3,mediocre,Mediocre movie. Plot is alright but acting is poor. Quality of images is great on HD tv. Overall I recommend if you have nothing better to do that day
5,interesting plot on time travel,Great acting with an impressive cast and the storyline has a unique and interesting twist on time travel. It's a movie that I definitely watch again with a friend.
3,Still Confused,"Was really excited about the movie, as it had a great reviews. Found it hard to follow and was pretty confused at different points.Joseph Gordon Levitt's wore a bunch of makeup to make him look more like Bruce Willy. I thought it just looked weird, added to my confusion.Took me a while afterwards to figure out what happened. I always struggle to wrap my head around movies about time travel."
3,Decent Sci-fi,"Not on par with high end science fiction like Prometheus, but a fun, at times haunting, and very violent flick."
5,Looper,Didn't know what to expect. But it was a good syfy thriller!!!!I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends.
2,An interesting letdown,"This film had some unique and original ideas, however, it felt like the writers were trying so hard make the ending an unexpected twist that they forgot to make sure it made sense. Much of the action happened so fast that there wasn't enough time to make the plot fit to the action. The first half of the film was interesting and neat the second half felt like the plot was abandoned to make room for action sequences and child murder.*Spoiler Alert*The end of the movie happens abruptly, and, stupidly. JGL kills himself to make sure his loop cannot kill the boy and complete the cycle. There is really no reason why he couldn't have waited and explained to Willis why he cannot kill the boy. The way the timeline works, if JGL killed himself at any point after Willis attempted to kill the child Willis' actions would have ceased to exist and the child would never have died."
2,Looper pooper.,"Started out like it might just be the excellent new sci fi film i read reviews for here. Less than an hour in,I realized it was getting real boring,real fast. What happened? Don't know. Don't care. This movie was all over the place,too much going on . Then,not enough. Judge for yourself but i can't see even wanting to give it a second chance & I do that sometimes & end up liking it. Not this one,though. No sir,it's a pooper."
3,Ok movie,"Decent concept but it dosent really make sense. Why can't they get rid of the bodies in the future, seems like if time travel is possible you should be able to get rid of a body."
3,Did not love or hate. Popcorn perhaps best part of viewing this.,"Trailer told me: time travel and Bruce Willis. Bruce as a ""Terminator variation"" perhaps?? Well, sort of. Have to pay attention (too much perhaps?) to get plot line sorted out and in the mean time, characters I don't much care for other than the Mom. Movie is ok as did not either hate or love it. Watch it a second time? Nope. Recommend it to another? Nope."
2,We usually like action films but we didn't like this,We like action films but we didn't like this because there's no value of life in it. It also deals with the fact that if you could go back in time And kill Hitler or someone like him as a child would you do it?
1,Stupid Movie,I found this story line to be stupid - It seems like Bruce Willis will take some rediculous parts sometimes but I guess its all about money - Save your money buy something else and send Hollywood a message.
1,Ugh.,"I love sci-fi, mysteries, and Bruce Willis... so you'd think this would be a hit with me. Disappointing on all three accounts."
1,save your money and time,"This was a terrible movie, wasted 90 minutes of my life!! Don't waste your money, acting and plot were subprime."
1,Horrible!,"Slow moving plot with repetitive violence (yes, we GET it!) Dark, depressing...not entertaining!Do NOT waste your time on this movie! Would not even give it 1 star if possible."
1,lacking in story line,The story just wasn't there. The movie was more like a collection of scenes put together to fill a set amount of time.
2,Not what I thought it to be,"Not a fan of this type of movie. Dealing with super natural issues or themes, just couldn't get into it."
3,"Good story, good acting.","A very entertaining twist on the time travel genre. Good acting by all, not just the main characters. Did not expect the ending."
3,Interesting but..,"Great premise, predictable at times... different ending. There were a couple of wholes in the plot but they were forgivable."
4,"Great movie, poor streaming","Loved the movie. Paid extra for HD on my PS3 and couldn't get more than 2 bars, till the end got 4, never HD. Connection test on PS3 was over 9gb. That should be enough. Concerns me cause I was going to start buying all my media through amazon because of the a availability on multiple devices. I might use Vudu to rent if amazon can't fix this. Google it and discovered others have had similar problems."
2,Typical,Typical Hollywood time travel movie. Predictable. Too much foul language that detracts from the dialogue and plot. Only redeeming part is the performance of the little boy as Sid. He definitely has a future in acting!
3,No surprises,"I love SciFi. There just isn't enough good SciFi at any one time. I paid for this, it was not worth it.No surprises. The acting is bad. I did not finish the movie. That rarely happens for me."
3,Willis works for rent money,"This movie appeared to have been staged to be a good movie with its left field story line, but they chose random violence over the story-line. Lack-luster performances."
3,Interesting,good movie with an interesting concept. Has a pretty good story line with some interesting characters. I would recommend it.
2,Sorry excuse for a movie,"It was too dark and made no sense.Why does Holywood insist on making movies so dark and ugly?BW is a good actor.He can act very well,but this was a dumb movie"
2,So boring.,I kept thinking - why don't they just kill him in the past so they don't have to find him in the future to kill him? Maybe I over thought it but I thought that made it completely implausible.
2,looper,"I really didn't like this movie to well, it dragged on and off through the whole movie. the ending was the best part of the movie."
3,Confusing Movie,good movie after I figured out what was going on. You really have to pay attention to what's going on
3,Predictable,"I was disappointed to realize that I knew exactly what would happen from the get-go. It's not terrible, but if you're a fan of this kind of movie then there are no surprises."
2,Ends up asking more questions then it answers,A popcorn flick through and through. If you are expecting believablity don't watch this movie. Unlike inception/matrix the writers herd just don't care that it does not make sense.
2,If you liked District 9 . . .,"Then you will love this ""gritty,"" depressing, anti-heroic ""sci-fi"" fable (not even a parable, which would have given it some sort of redeeming quality; but, no). The only redeeming act, of course, is that the looper commits to ending the loop, producing a possibly favorable outcome in the future; IF, that is, the kid grows up under the loving care of his mom and does not become the evil actor hinted at. The premise is clever, but one-note overall. Not living up to its potential development. But then I am a fan of more ""mainstream"" sci-fi: Serenity, Star Wars (original), and that ilk. Geez, I wish they'd make movies of Time Enough for Love and Foundation and THAT ilk. Solid, entertaining, epic."
2,Meh.,"I was looking forward to this movie, but there wasnt much to it, unfortunately. Willis and J-G-L were good, but not good enough to save the overall story."
4,Very cool,"My wife and I really liked this movie. I liked the special effects, Bruce Willis, and my wife liked the fact that the time travel theme didn't confuse the heck out of her!"
4,good movie,the movie was good it was just a little freaky to see the yolung actor made to look like Bruce Willis.
2,P J,"Seemed interesting but I didn't get to finish it, my wireless crashed. Fixing the wireless was more important than the movie"
2,didn't care for it,"Maybe we weren't paying close enough attention, but both my wife and I gotlost about which time continuum the main characters were from.It was just too convoluted to be an enjoyable movie ""to us""."
2,To Confusing for me Poor sound Mix Bad effects,"Good idea and maybe some will like it. I did not. Reason when I sit and watch a movie I just want to be entertained I do not want to try and figure out who is who, what is what. If your going to do a time travel film you better do it right this was far from being done right. (Example Back to the Future Excellent series) The action at times was going so fast dont know what the heck is going on, a choppy movie, a poor sound mix! If you set your sound so you can hear them speak and a explosion goes off you it is way to loud I was having to constant adjust volume for dialoge and then diff volume for action. Shame on the post sound mixers!! Poor locations like it was shot in a back ally, overall just thought it was kinda dumb."
5,GREAT MOVIE!,"It's not often Hollywood spits out anything original (these days anyway). But whenever that oppurtunity presents itself, I am on it, and let me tell you, I loved this movie. Everything about it was awesome, the story (very different, I think), the acting (JGL - enough said!), just everything. I liked the interesting, yet complex nature of the whole time travel concept. I saw it in the theaters, and I told myself when it comes out on DVD, OWN IT! So I checked to find out the date it was to be released DVD, bought it, have watched 3 times so far. Love it, love it, love it. Like I said, it's not everyday Hollywood greenlights anything with substance and quality, but when they do, I'll be there in line buying my ticket and/or the DVD. Great movie :)"
3,Interesting,It was different in that back in time sifi type of movie. Lots of action. Did like the two leading actors.
3,Entertaining but Hard to Follow,There was a lot of action which my husband enjoys but the plot was hard to follow. The sound was also not good. We were continually turning the sound up or down in order to understand what the characters were saying. It was worth watching but not Academy Award material.
3,Entertaining,"So long as you don't think too much about the ""Butterfly Effect"" of time travel it was entertaining. Not sure I'd watch it again though."
2,Why?,Why did anyone feel the need to make this movie? It's really bad. It's the only Bruce Willis movie I don't like.
3,Want to know how they know,"It was a cool concept, wish they would have addressed how they KNOW when the looper doesn't complete his loop."
3,Loopey?,"Kind of a neat concept, but even suspending disbelief that time-travel might exist the story-concept is still full of techni-holes. I'll watch it again when it hits the 'Prime' list. Check with me then for a (possibly) better review."
4,Entertaining Sci-Fi Movie! Solid 4 Stars!,Great story! Kid is scary and cute at the same time. Great acting and I can't believe Piper Perabo went topless. :)
3,not worth 3.99,"Movie was OK, but not worth $3.99. Not as much action as I would like and outdated time travel concepts"
3,It was good,At the end you feel like you should have seen it comming. It was a great story and it was a different out look on futer crime.
2,"Great idea, but it falls apart pretty quickly...","Watch the trailer if you need a synopsis, I'll get to the point. It was a pleasure to see Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt play the same guy. They both brought enough of themselves to the role while also adopting mannerisms unique to each other. This was nice, and at first the movie looked to be promising, but then it just got confusing and never recovered. The action was fast, gritty, and intense, the dialogue was clever and exactly what you expect from a Bruce Willis film, but none of it made any sense half-way through the film. It's a shame. There are much better sci-fi action flicks out there. Don't waste your money on this one unless you just feel compelled to watch a perfectly brilliant conceit go completely to waste."
2,Waste of time,"Poorly conceived, badly executed -- a real waste of time despite the slick trailers. No need to spend your money on this one."
2,"OK movie, but check your brain at the door","Entertaining, but not a bright one... The time travel mechanic shatters like a fabrege egg if you start analyzing it.Fun movie regardless. Worth a look."
2,wierd,"This is a strange movie, not really worth wasting your time to watch; I wish I didn't. Would only recommend to someone I don't like."
4,Typical Willis Flick,not bad. pretty much the same old thing with a new thought. Lots of action. Kind of prdictable but okay
4,"Good story, good action","It was actually better than I expected. It was not just action, it had a really good story as well."
4,Worth watching,"Not a very complex movie, but it was fun to watch. I think its best quality is that the lines between who is doing the right thing and who is doing the wrong thing are blurry until the very end."
5,love,"I enjoyed this movie very much, it was entertaining but it is definitely a movie you have to pay attention to or you will get lost."
4,Good movie,liked it alot... only fear was that my 2 year old would start to develop telekinesis... I am going to have to invest in a safe.
2,"More like ""Pooper""","Bruce Willis couldn't even save this craptastic movie. Too many things happening, time travel, telekinesis powers, hit men, the mafia, The future and the future..future you, and a hot chick on a farm???? I don't think so...and Joseph Gordon Levitt looks nothing like bruce Willis."
4,"I liked the movie, but renting videos is a pain","I rented the HD version of this movie, expecting to use Unbox to download and watch it.No dice. Unbox couldn't find it. The amazon viewer (on the web site) won't play in HD.So, good movie, bad user experience."
3,Looper movie,It was good- but should have paid less for it. I should have waited for it to come out in red box.
4,Mindbendingly Awesome,"Never have I seen a movie this original. Sure there are some problems, but they are so small that it's easy to let go."
3,Entertaining,"Great plot , I enjoyed it .But everything was just too crazy too believePossible as a near future in our world."
3,A decent action flick but it dragged at times,There were periods of time when the movie seemed to drag. The plot was interesting and the ending was a bit predictable but not until almost the end of the film. It was a bit bloody at times too. It's worth watching.*spoiler alert*You can take a 15min bathroom or popcorn break when you see the farm house and not miss much. :)
3,Just Okay,"I thought it was a little hard to get into. Good action, but slow plot devlopment. I have alwasy like Bruce Willis, but I thought this was not one of his best efforts.Gerry"
3,Just okay.,Some action. Some touching of the heart. Some interesting futuristic scenarios. A whole lot of suspension of disbelief. Not bad.
5,awesomemovie,"great movie, my whole family loved it. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I hope you like it as well."
4,Great movie,This was a great Sci-fi that tried not To get you to think about time-travel but then left you calculating all the possibilities.Gordon-levitt did a great job acting like Willis.
3,Looper movie,"Love Bruce Willis, one of the reasons I wanted to watch the movie. Starting to like Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an adult actor. Just didn't like the plot all that well. Too many unanswered questions, too many items not explained. Should have waited for the movie to make it to Starz."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"It's fun. The acting is fun to watch. The plot operates within its own rules, which are generally well-explained. It looks great. But you don't want to think about it too hard because (a) it'll hurt your brain, and (b) either the time-travel rules it gives itself are too arbitrary or it will turn out not to make sense. But it's a time travel film with JGL and Bruce, so what's not to like?"
3,Very interesting but awfully confusing,"The premise of this story is really interesting and the acting superb, but the four of us who watched it could not follow the story, particularly because it covered the same scene over and over with multiple outcomes."
3,Well made but not earthshattering,Everyone said this movie was amazing. I definitely enjoyed watching it but the plot seemed random. And I like science fiction. This isn't one for the ages. But it is entertaining for the evening.
3,Looper,It's okay this movie; however it is rather dark when you consider the killing on kids. Not something for just anyone some people would be put off with the plot.
1,Turkey,Confusing story line. Thought any movie with Willis would be good but I was wrong.Wish I could get my money back.
1,looper movie,it was a total dissappointment.itwas confusing and left me thinking they will try to make a sequel out of this piece of crap.the actors should be ashamed to have lent their names to this waste of time.
1,Great Expecations,The trailer is probably more awesome than the actual movie. So much potential and all we get is the main character sitting around a farm house. Pointless.
2,Dumb,"This movie tries hard but achieves little.We're supposed to side with saving the baby hitler?No, Bruce Willis' character was supposed to win, kill the evil kid before he grows up and destroys the world.Sip this and watch 7 Monkeys."
1,One of the reasons why there is so much darkness in the world.,"Minor spoiler alert.So this is what we have come to? killing children in movies? Directors and screen writers are so lazy that instead of attempting to write an original story that will bring true intrigue, they continually push the envelope of movie making to darker places, as in this movie where A CHILD IS SHOT or at least implied to be killed. Pathetic writing, lazy writing. A colossal waste of time and money. There is nothing satisfying about this movie,and actors, writers,etc who perpetuate this crap in the theaters are just as culpable of crimes committed in real life."
2,So-So,"The acting just felt flat across all the actors. The script didn't do enough character development; I never really understood the motivations and drivers of each of them. There wasn't really a ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"" (per-se) so you didn't know who you wanted to ""win"" in the end. I did think the ending resolution was a good call, however.I didn't hate it, but I wouldn't rush out to see it. It's worth a rainy-day rental once."
1,stoopid muvee,i just could not get into it. disjointed because of the time travel theme. actors sucked too. I usually lovethe sci-fi genre
1,Below a one star rating,Actually two levels below a one star rating if possible. Extremely disturbing and not worth watching. Wanted to turn it off and request a fund of my money.
1,BRUTAL,Don't waste your time on this Bruce Willis loser. We made it through the first 30 minutes bored to tears and then turned it off...waste of time and money.
1,horrible quality,i really cant keep trying amazon hd streaming. this was the worst one yet. thought i was watching Youtube. i get great quality on my Netflix so i know its not my equipment
1,Two hours I'll never get back,Cinematography so dark and underexposed as to render the film difficult to see. Very cheap and tacky digital shoot.Plot is foolish and a waste of time
1,Very hard to follow,This movie was very hard to follow the storyline. Overall I felt it was a waste of 3.99. And I love Bruce and still didn't like it.
1,A Huge Waste of your Eyeballs,This movie was AWFUL. I just watched it because I like Bruce Willis but it was AWFUL. He must have made this movie because no one else asked him for anything else. Don't waste your time.
1,dont waste your time (no pun intended),"i wish i could loop back in-time and not watch it, go firefly hunting, or feed some stray cats. this movie was retarded... i skipped through most of it which may or may not make this review, a review, but:the whole ""life runs in a circle"" thing as drawn at the very end of the movie was a nice concept but with the plot and story board of this movie... lame. the hinting of ""the ends justifies the means"" with killing the children, added to the fact that the one who supposedly cherished life and love was the one who was carrying out this horrendous escapade, was even more fuel to my fire of how... retarded this movie was. i watched the preview again after i watched it... i dont see a connection? someone please help me on that one..?..!"
1,Looper is a full on Blooper,"The plot of this movie may sound good on paper, but it's all over the place. It isn't worth the effort to stay attentive. Once you figure out what the guy is doing in the future, then you've pretty much seen the whole movie."
2,"so, did he or didn't he sleep with his mom?",Just wondering.And what is the story with the giant revolvers?The drug use was a plus. eighteen nineteen words.
1,Awful and Disappointing,"I was waiting for this movie for what seemed like a very long time.I was extremely disappointed - so much I had to turn the movie OFF!Awful direction - the world already has enough darkness - I thought a movie including quantum physics may include more light.When the 'good guy' isn't really, there is no one to root for.I don't know how it ended, but it wouldn't matter from where I could see and feel the writer was taking us.This is a movie where I didn't care for not one of the characters, which is when a story dies.I have only turned off a handfull of movies in my 40+ years and this was one of them."
1,Pass on Loopers,"The ads for this movie are the best parts. Pass on this movie, very over rated by the reviews here, lacks story line, typical earth at an end crime lords rule. Writing 20 words in order to simply give this one a one star."
5,My Favorite Film of 2012,"As stated above, this film blew EVERYTHING out of the water in terms of visual media for me last year. I don't particularly feel like writing out a full critical review here, but suffice it to say my admiration of it could not be higher. All I have to say is that if you want to see what people can do with the medium of film who actually understand what they're working with then this is a worthy choice in my book to check out."
4,Interesting,"I liked the ending and the wrap-up of the circle. Yeah, it was obvious who was what and so on, but I liked it and the little boy? OH MY GOODNESS!! Just wanted to eat him up - too amazing and cute. JGL's make-up was distracting though and a bit odd. I know why they did it, but it creeped me out because it looked like something was wrong with his face."
3,The story line drags a bit but it has it's good parts.,Joseph Gordon Levitt was disconcerting with his makeup and prosthetics but I liked him in this movie. The story line drags a bit and I had a hard time caring about anyone but Joseph.
3,Good Movie - Too Long Though,I thought this movie was good but I thought the timing of it was way to long for the story line.
4,"It had a good beat, and I could understand the words","Some crisp scenes, like the meeting in the diner, interesting plot devices like the shotguns in a sci-fi movie, parental lessons doses for young folks, and a typical ""What do we do now?"" Sci-fi ending. Thoroughly entertaining. Rent it, it is not a classic."
3,Slow and boring,The concept and storyline seems to be good.The acting is also good.The movie is just too slow and seems to take forever.At times it is very confusing for some people who don't pay attention.
4,"Fun, Funny and Entertaining","This was a good action flick. It kept my wife awake which is a test of whether it is interesting. Although a little predictable, you might be surprised at the end.. and it does get a little weird."
4,Looper review,Bad ending. I was very much unimpressed with the way the movie switched forwrd and backward and frequently lost track
3,over all interesting,There are a few holes in the logic of this movie. But the concept is very cool and the story moves along pretty well. Worth seeing.
4,Interesting and well done,"They do a decent job of creating a story like this -- time travel movies always have their snags. It was kind of a cop out in the diner scene, however, when the characters start discussing some of these paradoxes and Bruce just says 'I'm not going to get in to it'. It's an incredibly violent film, some of which, of course, is gratuitous and unnecessary for sure. So that part kind of bothered me. When it comes to murdering children, well, you know the story line and film needs to be very careful. So that is the down side. Otherwise, very unique and engaging story."
5,Loving Bruce,"About once a year there comes a clever sci fi movie. This one has it all for me, Bruce is the frosting on the cake."
3,Underwhelmed,"I had high hopes for this one. I thought the acting was good and I liked the aesthetic. But the pace of the thing just felt uneven, like they crammed two hours into the second hour of the movie."
1,Completely wrong and misleading.,"This book goes against every major tenent of modern spiritualism. There is absolutely no darkness, evil or negativity on the other side. If you hear dark or negative voices, telling you to do things which are wrong, these are definitely not from your spirit guide or guardian angel. These voices originate from within your own mind and nowhere else. Spirit contact always comes through only in goodness, love, understanding and healing.If these voices persist, one should seek the aid of a qualified medium or a competent psychotherapist.Hopefully this book is the result of a major misunderstanding or miscommunication on the author's part, and not yet another display of spiritual bigotry, intolerance, narrow-mindedness and misinformation which is so characteristic of FBOR's (Fear-based organized religion), particularly christian fundamentalism."
5,An Exceptional True Story Novel... You Can't Put Down,"This book is the most gripping, fascinating, and well-written true story, I have read in years. It is a must read for every Born Again Christian and/or anyone who has ever been or knows someone, involed in spiritual warfare, guardian angels, New Age, Occult, or Witchcraft. This book is factual, enlightening, and real. I went without sleep to finish it! It is truly unforgettable! I only wish, every pastor, layperson, parent, and child could read this and understand the seriousness, so eloquently presented in this book!"
5,A Great Compilation of a pleasant excentric band,"Korgis was a band with a different kind of music. Sometimes excentric, sometimes so in love... this compilation brings all of them, really cause the three first albums are here completelly (except the excellent album This World's For Everyone from 1992). Some songs (2 or 3) appears here in single format, one of them is a very beautiful love song All The Love In the World. Great Song is Don't Look Back, song title of this compilation (it's a non-album song) the most in love song of Korgis. Great songs like that are too: That was My Big Mistake, If I Had You, Can't We Be Friends Now, Living On The Rocks, If It's Alright With You Baby , and a very happy: It's No Good Unless You Love Me. You must listen this tracks as they are great, and the other are likely greats too. Korgis was and is a great group!"
5,This book really demonstrates the power of VB6,This book has MANY provocative examples of things that can be done with VB6. The examples are non-trival and not necessarily to be comprehended in one sitting (by me at least). This is definitely a book to work with while learnng to use VB6 and its many features (like the Microsoft msscript.ocx control (p. 506) which has really grabbed my attention). I give the authors high marks for producing this book.
2,For beginners,"I can't say it's a bad book but it wasn't for me. If you are relatively new to Visual Basic or you want to know what version 6 can do, take a look to this book.Beside that, look for more specific books like those from Wrox on VB6"
4,"Good ""cook-book"" for VB Beginners","I got this book about 2 years a go when I was starting on VB. It helped a lot on my learning. This is a cook book or ""How to..."" book that teaches you how to do many usual things so it's very useful when you are a beginner so you don't have to figure out how to do this things and It save you many time. Once you get in practice probably you won't need it any more."
4,Good Bathroom reading,"I would agree with some of the other reviews, ie., that a lot of what is in this book one could get off of the internet, and that the coverage of VB6 is pretty weak (if you compare this version with the previous version, there is not much difference), however it's a good source for advanced VB Topics and makes for some very good bathroom reading."
1,A waste of paper,"This book has absolutely nothing new to say about Chuck Jones. In fact it doesnt say much at all; just endless amounts of prose that add up to nothing. Rather than doing any reserach on his own, Kenner just takes his historical information from already published books on animation or from interviews he has done with Jones.The problems with interviewing Jones, however, is that he can be pretty self serving at times. So dont expect getting any real insight into Mike Maltese and Maurice Noble's contributions to his films, and certainly not any comparision to the work of Bob Clampett, who Chuck Jones hates with his guts. (They had a lifelong feud) For real insight into the work of Chuck Jones, try the articles written by Richard Thompson in Film Comment in the seventies, or Michael Barrier's book Hollywood Cartoons"
5,Great socket for the price,well built and priced at a point that if it does get lost or in the unlikely event I'm able to put more torque on it then it can take and cracks I won't be left crying.
4,A little large.,"The watch is just as pictured, but it was a little larger than I thought. I bought it for my 6 year old grandson, because he wanted a 'square' watch like is Aunt. It is cute, but doesn't really fit his wrist."
4,Got a little confused,I bought this book thinking it was the textbook because they look just alike and are both softcover but obviously it says WORKBOOK. Me and my classmate did the exact same thing. I haven't used it because the workbook isn't required. Im going to sell it.
1,I DID NOT RECEIVED THE BOOK,I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE I DID NOT RECEIVED THE BOOK. MY FEELING IS THAT THE SELLER NEVER SENT IT. SHE SAID THAT IT WAS LOST.JULIO STERN
3,"Pleasant scent, but not basil-like","I grow a dozen different kinds of basil every summer, and the Basil-scented cleaner doesn't smell like any basil I've ever grown. That said, it has a light, pleasant, clean scent and I've no complaints as to it's efficacy.The Lavender scented cleaner is well-fragranced, however."
3,Mrs. Meyers,"Didn't see what all the fuss was about. although the Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day All Purpose Cleaner, Lavender, 32 Ounce Bottle has a great smell, i can't see where its cleaning power out performs scrubbing bubbles or clorox power and free. i do like the fact i am being kind to the environment by refilling used bottles this and the scent scores this 3 stars"
4,Clean freak!,"I bought a sample bottle of this at a local store, I am now hooked. It's like crack for cleaning. The scent is great, I was concerned that lavender would be too over-powering, but it just smells fresh and a little like herbs.Great stuff, and good to know it's safe!"
5,Awesome cleaner,"Great cleaner, smells great! The bottle of concentrate is much more cost effective! My cleaning lady specifically requested that I buy this. It does a great job, leaves glass streak less and smells so good!"
5,Love this product,I love this product and the basil scented one is amazing. Makes cleaning more enjoyable.
5,My favorite cleaner,"This is a wonderful cleaner! It smells really good (so I somewhat enjoy cleaning), and it works great. I haven't had a problem with the streaks that the other reviewer mentioned, however I don't have tile floors. I use it on my finished wood floors and it works amazing. I have a swiffer wet jet, and I have problems with that leaving streaks, but I don't have a problem with this. I just make up a bucket and clean my bathrooms, floors, counters, cabinets, etc, all at once. And it lasts a really long time because you dilute it so it's economical compared to some other all natural cleaners."
4,not a cure all,If you're looking at this zinc supplement to help clear up your skin...beware. taking 3 or 4 was the most effective dose for me and that just means the bottle doesn't last very long. I wish I could get a giant bottle with quadruple dose supplements.
2,Not Suitable for Vegetarians,I like NOW Foods Zinc Picolinate 50 mg but I will never buy it again because it contains gelatin capsules instead of the vegetable based capsules. Gelatin is made from animal byproducts and is not suitable for vegetarians.I like the benefits of Zinc Picolinate but I will have to find some other brand.
1,burn who?,you've gotta be kdding me!!!! this is a VERY bad excuse for a band....the original burn which got back together 2 years ago was THE original BURN.....and some of the pioneers of NYC hardcore music....chaka maliek must be flipping out....i can't see him signing ovee the right to the name burn so easily especially to the likes of this band.....
5,A simple explanation of enlightenment,"This is an excellent book. It is spiritual without dogma or religion. I would strongly recommend this book to any truth seeker. Surprisingly and unfortunately, the author has not produced any other works.There are small, yet important, universal truths exposed in this book which aren't discussed or considered in other similar books. This book could change your life!"
2,Yeesh.,"This is one miserable recording. Fans of Manzanera should turn (or return) to Diamond Head, 801 Live, Listen Now, K-Scope or early to mid-era Roxy. If you see this disc in the store run away as quickly as possible before you begin to consider giving in to temptation and buy it. It is nothing more than weak, uninspired and dated wimpy pop music. One of the few lows in an otherwise brilliant career. Avoid it all costs...Simon"
5,Love it,Joe Cocker was always one of my favorite singers. This is a great album. Seller delivered in a fast manner.
1,Audio Quality is awful,"I can't believe what the criminals @ A&M have foisted upon us. The mix is awful and I can't imagine they even mastered this one. Unbelievable rip off. So sad, Joe Cocker gets screwed again by this episode in his life."
5,Classic Rock,"If you enjoy Joe Cocker, this is a must buy. It has the old favorites such as She Came In Through The Bathroom Window and Feeling Alright."
4,Mrs. Myers Dish Soap,"I love all of Mrs. Myers products, but especially the Lavender scent dish soap and the Geranium scent. The lavender smells wonderful, and cleans as well as any products from the shelf. I really appreciate the fact they do not test on animals. I will stay with Mrs. Myers products because of this. I also like the fact that all their products are biodegradable and all their bottles are made with at least 25% post-consumer plastic and can be recycled. I think you will love this product also.Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Bathroom Cleaner, Lavender, 24 Ounce (Pack of 2)"
3,The soap had a funky smell,"I was looking forward to a lavender scented dish soap. This dish soap had that but it also had a funky smell. It worked okay for washing dishes, but not well enough for me to continue purchasing this product."
5,Oh the hilarity that ensues!,The Wheelman is one of the three best books I've read this year.It is a madcap romp through the underbelly of Philadelphia.
3,Pulp Fiction Meets 24,"Duane Swierczynski's THE WHEELMAN is a fast-moving, darkly humorous cross between PULP FICTION and 24 , a non-stop blur of turnabouts, double-crosses, coincidences, cliff-hangers and switch-backs. At first the dizzying, relentless pace of the plot is exhilirating, funny and addictive...full of quirky characters and sudden violence... but about 3/4s of the way through, it becomes tiresome and repetitive (it doesn't help that the characters themselves are going around in circles). While there's much to admire in Swierczynski's tight prose, sharp dialogue and colorful characters, he gets too caught up in his own cleverness, letting his plot spin into nothing. Ultimately, the book is a ride that doesn't take you anywhere... a race without a finish line. But there's no doubt Swierczynski has got the talent, and the voice, to write a great crime novel. And I wouldn't be surprised if his next one is it."
5,Great read with no filler,"This book is extremely fast paced, and includes no filler. There is always something happening, and it's always entertaining. It is one giant bad day (or three) for the main character Lennon. When you think nothing else can go wrong it does.Nothing is really done to make Lennon a likable character but he gets screwed around so much it's hard not to cheer for him. Even when he's killing people that he could probably let walk.The Wheelman is a violent journey revolving around a bank robbery gone wrong. It keeps you wondering who sold him out, and where the money went. Deals are made and deals are broken. Heads spray apart, and everyone has their own backstabbing plan.The book is written in short chapters that jump between characters, yet remains easy to follow. It's a great read with a high body count, a book where absolutely no one is safe."
2,Full of unexplained terms and confusing descriptions,"The typesetting makes this book unpleasant to read. However, it is the writing style that makes the reading a frustrating experience: The author throws you piles of technical terms without clearly explaining their meaning, or the relation to and difference from related acronyms. It might be a book for you only if you are already a telecom expert. Otherwise, you would probably find yourself in a similar situation to mine--hoping someone can help you with tons of questions you cannot find answers for from this book."
4,"Very good songs from Bill's ""Magnetic Sketchbook""","Bill Nelson has released something like 12 albums of home demos, ""magnetic sketches"", over the past decade. This album, released in 1995 but recorded between 1988 and 1992, was part of a 4CD boxed set but now available as a single disc, is a strong set of rockin' pop songs.""My Philosophy"" kicks off the album with blazing guitar tune full of fire and fury and a bit of an ironic lyric ""Here comes my philosophy/Leave it, let it be"" which Bill rips into another solo. Other standouts include ""Buddha Head"", a great lost synthpop song. ""Big River"" another sweeping epic. Probably the best of the bunch is ""Lotus In The Stream"", with the beautiful ebow & guitar solo in the middle.Missed the days of Be Bop Deluxe? OK, there's no ""Yorkshire Landscape"" here, but this is still pretty good stuff coming out of the man's analog 16-track studio."
3,"Works well, looks good, a little narrow...","A little narrow, but works well. I can get the mail out of it without issue and my hands are pretty large."
2,Pretty. Not so functional.,"Firstly let me say... This mailbox is beautiful. It looks pretty on my wall next to my door. I'm happy with how it LOOKS.That is pretty much the only positive.The mailbox is too deep. I have to hoist myself up and stick my whole arm down into it to get my mail out. If a small letter is at the bottom of the mailbox, I almost rip my arm off trying to get it out.Secondly, the lid doesn't open very wide at all. AT ALL. It just barely comes up a bit, not nearly enough for me to get my whole arm down in there to get the little pieces of mail off the bottom. And whenever I try to open the lid any further than it wants to go, it makes this cracking noise like I'm tearing the whole thing up.So, not really a functional mailbox at all.But, it is pretty."
1,Don't waste your money on the AGS CD-ROM. Get the book.,"Why bother with the CD when the book is such a pleasure to use?The BOOK rates SIX STARS. The CD rates NO STARS. Get the book for half or a third the price of the CD. It's worth it.The cd contains many raster scans of tables from the book and links to commentary that you can find elsewhere in greater detail. The links to industry aren't anything special, considering you can find them many other places for free. The interface is clunky, and hard to read. Access to the data is read-only off the CD rather than allowing you to load it and access it from the hard drive. The vector CAD drawings are simplified and generic - suitable for instruction, but certainly not for real work. You won't save any time trying to use them for anything but reference, so why bother? This CD is worth 1% of its list price and should just come with the book at no cost. Don't be taken in by the hype."
3,And ok expansion...,"No much to say here, and I still have not completed the last mission. To hard really it seems."
1,Awful,"My children will read and enjoy just about any book they get. We got this for free through the Scholastic book club, and my kids like it ok, but there are so many MUCH MORE creative books out there! I mean, come on, a bird eats EGGS for breakfast and brings a worm home as a friend? Children's books don't have to make sense, as a general rule, but that's just weird. There's no rhyme and no real plot other than the fact that this bird has no clue what a worm looks like. Please find something more imaginative and more entertaining to read for your children."
5,This was my first book.,"This book was given to me as a gift for Christmas in 1969. It is one of my first memories. I couldn't read yet, but I loved the pictures, especially of the friendly worm. I wish the old spiral-bound format with the thick pages was still available. It was very sturdy."
1,Almost a good program,"Almost a good program but its shorfallings make it very frustrating to use. It's like a pickey women (or man) and you are going to spend more time trying to keep it happy than you will doing books. ie. Write a purchase order and then find out you were off by a penny. Sure, you can fix it. But only after a long and complicated task. It's hard to believe these people aren't scarecrows in Kansas. Also the invoice price area is too small. I can't see the entire price on big orders and there is no way to adjust it. There are little quirks like these all over the program. I highly recommend finding another program. But for Mac OS, good luck!"
1,Unable to convert Quickbooks Version 6 to MYOB,"I bought this version on the promise that my data from Quickbooks Pro for Mac could be translated over to MYOB. This just isn't true. What you get when you transfer is your contacts and your account list with a balance in each account. You lose all of your transaction history. This is not a data transfer, just creation of accounts with an opening balances. Comments in the past had glowed about this program. More recent ones do not. If you have a quickbooks system and want to leave that package (for good reasons) MYOB will not work for you."
3,"It's Okay, But....",I would be more impressed with this if it had two USB outputs -- one to power the transmitter and one to power my USB Sansa E200. The transmitting ability is spotty to very good depending on where you are.
2,So-So,"I needed a way to play music from my iPod in my car. This piece is very user-friendly but the sound quality was terrible. If you listen at a low volume it's fine but I like blasting my music. If you're looking for an iPod/car transmitter, I suggest you look into other options..."
2,Good item...if it were more durable,"I got this tuner and it was excellent! I bought it from Amazon.com, and it didnt have any of the problems my friends told me they had with theirs. When i plugged this into my ipod, it produced a sharp, quality sound, and had a strong enough signal that it could even play over a broadcasting radio station. Unfortunately, it broke after only a month due to its fragile build. I would give it two, maybe three stars because the quality was excellent, but the durability sucked."
2,poor quality???,Product did not work out of the box.I took it apart and soldered the power wire on. Then it worked fine. Does seem to have lower volume then I expected. I have to turn the volume on my sandisk clip all the way up.
1,Worst product ever!,"The Phillips G2G302 Wireless FM transmitter is the worst product I have ever bought. Quite frankly I am surprised, as I have purchased other Phillips products that are wonderful. The transmitter messed up my radio requiring me to take it to my mechanic to fix.(The speakers stopped working). I purchased this product from Naturally Good Enterprises. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! They only guaranteed the product for 30 days and of course, it suddenly stopped working after 6 weeks. I paid $60.00 US dollars for the product and they are not refunding my money. Purchasing this product is a big waste of time and money and is a rip off. Naturally Good Enterprises does not stand behind its producta and what they sold me is subpar."
4,Great Worship Experience,"I highly recommend this CD for those times when you need to close yourself with God and shower Him with worship and adoration. I don't get tired of listening to the songs in this CD project. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
2,defective item,"The item skips all the way through and I do not like that, but I love his music. I would like a different one"
3,pretty good,the music is beautiful and words are great. I enjoy some of the songs more than others. They are all slow though so be aware.
3,Not all that impressive,"Cost to much, but I needed it anyway. Works Okay for what its used for. Not so hard to find."
3,So-So for smart phone use,"I spend a lot of time on my cell phone for conference calls and I've found that having very clear audio helps a lot with picking out conversations when there is a lot of back ground noise or other discussions going on in the group. I tried the Yamaha based on the brands reputation, and because of it's over the ear fit, something I find more comfortable when I'm wearing a head set for long periods of time. The audio is clear, however when using the head set with my cellphone the volume was to soft for good listening even when the phone was set for maximum volume. The head set works fine with a PC and my MP3 player, so I think the problem is my phone is underpowered for the speakers in the head set."
5,Super comfy,You can forget you are even wearing a headphone set. and the sound is top rate. The mike swings up out of the way and stays put when you aren't using it. Nice price too.
4,Good for the price,We are using them for sports broadcasting. The price is much cheaper than most headset mics. They give us decent sound. We have to use the converters to connect to our mixing boards. They are pretty sturdy.
5,"so cheap, so good!","for this price you will be surprised! I recently spent 120 on Sennheisers (PC350), but they had very weak bass and broke after just a few months of use.i decided to get a cheaper replacement, and was very happy to find that the Yamaha CM500s provided great bass and sound, the mic is very clear too!couldn't have asked for better, these have lasted a year+ already without any problems, if and when they do break i will be buying another pair."
4,Good for the money.,"I've had this headset for a few weeks now and no real complaints. It's comfortable and the sound quality is good enough for basic gaming. There's no volume control on the headset itself, which would have been nice."
5,Another great Yamaha product,"Great headphone with microphone. A bit heavy, yet sturdy and still comfortable. Produces great sound for enjoyment of music. Microphone reproduces spoken sounds with great clarity. Excellent for recording of speech, voice communication and gaming. Due to relatively high impedance, will eat your batteries fast, if used with any portable devices."
2,dissapointed,"""Product DescriptionClosed-ear headphones with dynamic mic""These DO NOT have a dynamic mic element. They have an ELECTRET mic element..at least the pair I received sure does as it's clearly stated right on the front of the package in big letters ""CM500 Headset With Electret Microphone""that's why they come with the little battery box as an electret element needs power to the element where a dynamic element doesn't. I should have returned these as soon as I saw that as for my needs I prefer a dynamic microphone"
1,Wrong description,"It states its got a dynamic mic. It does not. It has an electret mic and a battery box in series with the microphone to provide power. It states the phones are noise cancelling - not really. They reduce outside noise passively by covering your ears, but there is no active noise cancellation. This is not the product it appears to be."
1,Poor Quality,"Cheap plastic, received in a broken condition! Upon opening the package found the microphone hanging by a wire. The plastic part that swivels the microphone on the ear piece was broken and would not stay in place."
4,Yamaha CM500 headset,"A ham radio outlet recommended the Yamaha CM500 headset to meet my requirements that the earphones cover my ears entirely and effectively suppress ambient noise interference for ham radio signal reception. It is a good recommendation. I am happy with this headset!The supplied microphone is a plus that is very useful in a quiet environment.As with numerous other purchases through amazon.com, we ordered this headset with confidence that the product would be delivered promptly and that if any problem occurred with the purchase, amazon.com would solve it.[delete the following: there was a mess with unidentified suppliers and late shipping, but the merchandise was worth the wait. I believe amazon.com has taken over shipping of this item - that should help!]"
2,Yamaha CM500,"Headset for $40-$50 with noise cancelling and a mic. It's a good deal, and it's comfortable. The only problem is the bass. It's horribly out of control. If I change the equalizer on my computer, then the headset either sounds worse, or very dull. After 10 minutes my ear drums hurt from the spew of garbage it produces. I would only recommend this headset for casual music. The mic has a bit of a buzz, but it's still good. 2/5"
2,"Good for listening, bad for phone calls","I work from home and am on a ton of phone calls. Most headsets are small and wireless, which is great but they sacrifice sound quality and comfort (think 90 minute calls) for convenience. I thought these would give me great sound and comfort at the price of being bulky and corded, which is fine for me.The reality is they will work with my droid ... kind of. Sound is great most the time, but occasionally it's super faint. Most of the time the mic works almost too well as I had a co-worker point out I should mute while making tea because it was audible - something my two bluetooth headsets never picked up. But sometimes the mic just doesn't work, or I'm so faint no one can understand me. Also the sound only plays in my left ear. I suspect the converter is mono and there may be a workaround for this but I haven't investigated yet.Overall the headset works fine about 90% of the time, but that's just not good enough so back they go."
4,Does what I ask it to do--at a great price,"I was looking for an inexpensive headset to use during sports broadcasts. You'll never mistake the sound for a high-end set you'd pay $400 or more for, but it sounds plenty good, it's comfortable for long-term use (I have it on for more than four hours at a stretch during a game and have no problems), and I would recommend it."
4,WP100 Really Works,"I purchased this product due to lack of dental insurance. From the first use I was stunned to see how much food was trapped in-between my teeth. No wonder my gums bother me. I still Brush first, then floss, then waterpik.Only cons are its hard to find certain replacement brushes. The other thing is the water container is kind of leaky.I would recommend this product to any one with sensitive gums. Also for people that have had any dental work done that leaves gaps between teeth."
5,waterpik ultra water flosser review,"The waterpik is much improved over my last one - much easier to use. Anything that promotes health of my teeth is appreciated, especially for my 2 implants."
1,Broke after three uses AND caused electric problems,"I bought this water pik after a friend suggested using a water pik in addition to regular brushing. I decided to splurge and get a name brand- one of the more expensive ones available. The first time I used it, I plugged it into my bathroom electrical outlet- and it worked, but then blew the fuse in the bathroom. (I live in a new house, not an old one so I don't know why this happened.) I thought it must be a fluke. I moved to another bathroom- plugged it in. Same thing. I moved to the kitchen, same thing. THREE plugs.Aside from that weirdness, the water pik leaks everywhere. Water just sprays everywhere. Use this if you want to make a mess all over your bathroom."
4,water pick,"So far, so good. I adopted a previous reviewer's suggestion of adding a bit of mouthwash to the water and find this to be very refreshing.I wish the top had a wider lip as in my hands it falls into the reservoir when I attempt to replace it."
4,Better than flossing!,"Let me first preface this with the fact that I HATE flossing. My teeth are extremely tight (aided by my wisdom teeth which are to be removed next week!) so flossing is not easy. Floss gets stuck, rips, and I end up jamming the floss hard into my gums trying to get it in between my teeth.We've been using this little device for about 2 months now. Boy is this a whole lot better than flossing!! My husband has enjoyed it better than flossing as well.It is a little large on our bathroom counter, and makes some noise, but I'll take that over painful flossing any day!We haven't used any of the additional tips yet, haven't seen a need for them, but nice to have I guess."
4,All positive except..,"The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser works great. I was very satisfied with the first one purchased through Amazon about three years ago. The tube going from the tank to the handle eventually developed a crack and leak. This tube is somewhat ridged to facilitate the coil for storage. However, the constant motion and this lack of flexibility caused the leak. Still a very good product for the price. I recently bought the same product as a replacement."
4,A Great Help for Children with Braces!,"I purchased this for my son who has braces. The use of this WaterPik, (in addition to good brushing) has made teeth cleaning rather easy. The model I have contains an attachment kit with tiny brushes which are helpful in cleaning around the braces. This is the first WaterPik I have purchased. The price was good, and shipping was free! I am rating it at 4 stars, because it remains to be seen if it will last for years or not! So far, so good!"
1,Good Way to Waste of Money,Works great until it quits and it will quit sooner rather than later. No customer service for a poor quality product. Buy the attach to shower or to faucet type oral irrigator. They work well and are very reliable.
5,Pulsating,I have had several waterpiks over the recent years and this one is by far the best and is easy to use. After brushing there is often residue left and the waterpic just did the trick of leaving an amazingly clean mouth
4,Great Product,"I have bridge work and the flosser does an excellent job of cleaning out food particles. It takes a little getting use to it, but works great!"
5,it cleans deep your teeth,"the sensation of clean it is amazing, use water with Listerine , need to be careful with the strength of the water jet, because of course it fill your mouth with water, so it is a game of rinsing and spitting and timing how long to keep it inside, but it is how it get the job done very nicely!!"
5,Excellent product for the price!,"No need to waste any more words to this product!After ~2k positive reviews, all I can say is that your $50 will be well invested!It's worth having this tool for your dental hygiene!If anything, I wished there was a setting to get more powerful bursts of water, while using less water.Meaning the water goes through quite quickly (one basin is good enough for one mouth)."
3,The Waterpic ulra water flosser helps me remember to floss more!,My dental hygenist recommended it. . .I believe I pay more attention to flossing since I have the waterpic. . .I'm not at all certain what all the attachments that came with it are to be used for though. . .
4,Not as powerful as our last one,"We ordered this thinking it would be exactly like our previous model. I think it is the same model number but I am not sure. Anyway, it needs more oomph to get the job done, in my opinion. Not bad, just a tad weak."
4,It is sufficient.,I like the battery powered flosser better but it doesn't last that long.I would also like stronger water pressure.
2,It's like comparing a 4 cylinder to a V8,Much less power than my old WaterPik even at the highest power level.The stream of water is very weak although the motor is much quieter than my old one.I'm disappointed.
1,Nothing but problems...,"We managed to get a few months of decent use from the water jet before the cut-off switch started sticking. After 1-2 minutes of prodding it would finally release, sending water spraying across the room. It was funny the first few times, but after several dozen, it got very old. Coupled with the too-short hose and a nozzle which broke off inside the handle, I recommend searching elsewhere. I know I will be."
4,good value good features,"I ordered this because I find it really difficult to floss with braces on. I borrowed one from a friend that was a different brand and knew I had to have one. This unit has some good attachments, I threw the tongue scraper out though since there isn't enough storage in the lid for all the attachments. The cord and the hose are a nice length suitable for most bathroom set ups. The pressure on the unit is not as strong as I had hoped. I have to crank it to 8 or 10 to get a real feeling of clean. The lower settings would be good for irrigation. I find that one full tank of water is enough to ""floss"" the teeth. If you have trouble flossing or have braces, I highly recommend getting this machine."
3,v.good BUT,"just bought this waterpik,initial thoughts were very positive* nice big water tank* adjustable water jet is great* small and compact* even the legnth of the water hose is okBUT i read of the leakage of the base/tank so i thought i would not fill the tank up each timebut fill the tank with a glass to save wear and tear on the water ""connection"" seal.........but alas only after a few days there is a puddle under the waterpikseems like we can send a man to the moon, but we can't make a waterpik leekproof"
4,Your Gums With Thanks You!,"My dentist recommended this several times, and I finally thought I'd give it a try. It is not a substitute for brushing and flossing. What it does do is give you an ultra-clean result. My guess is that I'll be spending less time in the dentist's chair if I brush, floss,Waterpik, and use Listerine. The design is well thought out. An included quick start card was all that I needed to get it up and running.The first time around I felt like my gums took a beating. Note you can dial down the pressure until your gums firm up. Also you don't want to hit your softer tissue like under your tongue or throat with the high pressure water. Ouch ;)I understand that they make a smaller, portable version. But my dentist said that it give the same results due to a lower pressure. I'd be tempted to try the smaller version for trips. Lugging the full size unit around would be a hassle."
5,Pick this Waterpik,"Initially I dismissed products like these as nothing more than a money-making ploy but I purchased one as recommended by my dentist's assistant. The first time I used it was pretty much a disaster, possibly due to my lack of coordination but I kept at it and am glad I did. The product gets to places my brush and floss are apparently missing. The settings allow me to adjust the water stream to my tolerance/comfort level. The handle is easy to grip, especially if you have difficulty gripping a regular toothbrush like I do."
2,The Once Reliable Toothbrush - Now Unreliable,"I have been using the Oral-B Pulsars for a while now - probably since the product launched - but for some reason, the past three Pulsars I've bought died on me within a couple of weeks of owning it. Perhaps Oral-B went with a cheaper battery or something. Regardless, this is quite annoying, particularly since I can't replace the battery by myself (the bottom of the toothbrush is sealed shut)."
3,It's ok...,"First it was great. I started at 1 pressure then now I am up to 10 pressure. Your gums do improve and gets stronger. My mouth do feel cleaner after every use. Be careful on your first use, since water will get everywhere. One problem, the button on the handle gets stuck. It's very annoying!"
3,About time they made a replacement hose!,"About time they made a replaceable hose!I was not going to buy any more of these because the hose rots and breaks and then the whole unit becomes worthless as there is no way to fix it.After three of them I was fed up. I think built in self destruct so you have to buy another one. They may say to get the best hose it can not last long and be a great hose or something but the other brand I have used the hose does not rot out but it does not have enough pressure.I like this brand more than the other products I have tried because it has much higher pressure options.I also like the storage feature on the lid.Looking at the applicator handle it looks like there is no way to connect the replacement hose to the handle so I assume I will have to pay for a handle and a hose when it rots out?I certainly would never buy the models that do not have the replacement hose option,I have three of them and they don't work because of broken hoses!"
4,Good but expensive,The WP-60W is just as powerful and works just as well. That holds more water and requires fewer refilling.
5,Waterpik is excellent!,Since purchasing this product my wife and I use this twice a day with the excellent results. I will be disappointed if the next dental appointment does not confirm this. PR in NHWaterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet
4,Really like this but can't find new attachments,We purchased this months ago and I really like it. Haven't had any problems with it. My only complaint is that I can't find extra attachments.
3,Easier than flossing,"Have now for a month, I like it in general but there are a few things that are a pain:The main tip (like the one it is displayed with, moves. To work on the backside of your teeth, it always turns inside your mouth and it is hard to get the back of the front teeth cleaned. The water tank lid is a pain, falls in to the tank sometimes. A light flip open lid would be so much better. But it works in general well (even if I would love a little more pressure)."
2,disappointing,"I have been an avid user of the waterpik for many years. This product, although more streamlined, does not have the power of the older models. This has many more applications for brushes, picks etc. and the design ok but the power not as good. I was disappointed in this new model. I would have returned but did not want the hassle. I called the company and was told to return quickly and they would test the motor but I decided not to send back. It is usable but in comparison to my older model just not as good. I would not repurchase this brand again."
2,Worked really well... while it worked...,"I really enjoyed using this Waterpik, especially with the toothbrush attachment. Unfortunately, after about 6 months of use, it appeared that the plastic tubing was getting kinked (where it met the handle). Unkinking it seemed to work until this last week - now it no longer pumps water at all. It's 1 year and 2 weeks old. To say I am disappointed that such a well respected company such as Waterpik would put out such a flimsy product is an understatement."
2,Waterpik flosser,This was not a very powerful product. The original waterpik that I replaced was much better. It doesn't have a very strong stream of water to floss teeth.I would not recommend it.
4,water pik,"water pik works as promised, but there is only one basic cleaning tool, so two people cant use it,and some of the other tools included in the package are not needed. For more than single use, you have to purchase additional piks, this is only available at Bed and Bath, and they dont stock, so an order is needed, very inconvenient."
5,This is great.,"I have received it for about a month, and it is just good! The quality is good. When I just ordered this one, I saw it in Costco for around 60 bucks which include an extra travel size one! Well, anyway, I still like it."
4,Works fine,"I've had this for 2 months, and it performs up to my expectations.I've only tried the one standard attachment, and I use the product at its highest setting."
5,Excellent,This product is excellent. It's ideal for people who hate flossing. It is user friendly and much less time consuming. I'll recommend the Ultra Waterpik Flosser to persons with braces.
5,Waterpik purchase at Amazon,This is the third Waterpik I have owned. Many years ago my then dentist recommended that I purchase one and use it daily because of spacing between my teeth. This latest model Waterpik is the best yet. I can use it for brushing as well as cleaning between my teeth. I am thoroughly pleased with this product.
5,works great!!,My sister bought a watepick and told me how much she loved it so i thought i would give it a try. I am glad i did. I love using it!!
1,no tips where is the 6 tips?,"I received my waterpik but no tips. The description says 6 tips but the tip holder has none. So, I was not able to evaluate this product."
3,Not Quite as strong,"This is a great little machine, not quite as strong as my old water pickand the storage department for extra picks is just ok"
4,Waterpik Ultra Review,Well priced on Amazon. The unit recommended by my dentist holds enough water for on session. Not portable like their smaller unit but great for home use. The tubing for the water could be longer.
4,Excellent quality,"It feels good to use! I never thought it would feel so good! The space between me and them almost no teeth, so I was surprised the lovely warm feeling that they rushed between the water column! My gums feel that they have to appreciate the ""hot glue!""I find this particular part of favorite unit is that it covered, allowing you to clean and protect the glass wand, when you do not use a well-designed mobile part of the above! This means that no trade-off the toothpaste or spit or urine cast or any contamination will splash into them, they have not been used, but they are very convenient to go when you're ready to use wall."
4,Works Great!!! It is 120 VOLTS 60 HZ ONLY,"It does work very well but international travelers need to know it is 120 VOLT 60 HERTZ only.I use it with a travel transformer, but because other countries use 50 Hz (transformers do not adjust frequency) it pulses slower than in the US, but it still gives satisfactory performance. The lower frequency will probably shorten the pump motors life, but because it works so well, I can live with that. The manufacturers website gave NO Information about the voltage and frequency for this unit and that is why I give only 4 stars.My vendor was J&R; MUSIC AND COMPUTER WORLD and I give them my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION for fast responsive service to APO and FPO addresses.I would have purchased directly from Amazon, but I live on a Forward Operating Camp in Iraq and Amazon does not ship most items to APO addresses."
2,Lasted 90 Days!!!!!,Good news and bad news. Good news: I used this thing twice a day for 3 months filled with mouthwash and it had a major impact on my gums. Bad news: the holder for the handle broke after three months. It's not particularly well designed and not particularly durable. However it seems to be the best thing available.
1,Use it and it will break in a month,"Hope you like dealing with customer service, if you plan to actually use this product, expect it to fail within a month. If you plan to let it sit next to your sink, I would highly recommend this product. The handle is the weak link in the design, we have been through a pile of these things!"
3,NOT VERY POWERFUL,I have had water piks before but this one doesnt seem as powerful.I would not re buy....although it stores nicely on bathroom counterand plug in cord plenty long and many additional piks but justwish motor was more powerful....jet stream hardly does the job..
3,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,The Waterpik flosser works well but does not replace good old manual flossing. I have flossed after using the Waterpik and removed food particles that were left behind.
5,Water Pik Water Flosser,"I was impressed with the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. It has several tools for overall oral hygeine. The tools include a pik to clean under the gum line for those addressing peridontal issues, a regular water flosser and other items. The pulsating sensation is very soothing. I like the range in level of pulsating as well. My dental hygenist suggested Water Pik to keep my peridontal disease in check. I actually enjoy using it. The price was reasonable compared to purchasing it elsewhere."
4,works great for me!,"my friend recommended Waterpik products for me when we went shopping, so i got one for my parents and one for myself. and this Ultra water flosser really works great for me so far. you should try it as well!"
3,Great for braces,"I purchased this for my son who has braces. It has really made a difference in his being able to get the food particles out of his braces. What I did not like about it is that even though it has many different waterpik heads for different uses, it only has one of each so it is not made to be shared among family members because there is only one set of heads. I would have preferred multiple heads for each family member or the option to select multiple heads for many family members instead of multiple heads for different uses."
5,Far better than expected,"I had high expectations to begin with, but even these were exceeded! I am a skeptic at heart, and hoped for the impossible, to have the equipment work longer than the prior Waterpik portable product. It has, and despite the lack of portability, works even better.The water resevoir is quite large, the stationery unit with the attached ""pik"" isn't an issue, and it cleans like a ""house afire"". In short, this is a home run. With the multiple pressure settings and various attachment, it is a MUST HAVE item for every home. The supplier met the delivery promise as well. I can't find fault anywhere.ADDED LATERAfter having used it for 1 1/2 years(no, really!)I can easily say my original views haven't diminished. It is sad that dental ""professionals"" do not recommend this item to more clients. I can however, understand why.It all but eliminates the need for dental work due to chronic gum issues. It also helps those of us who dislike/forget to floss regularly."
5,Easy Cleaning purchased from Amazon,"This product exceeded my expectations. Set up instructions were easy to follow. It is very easy to fill and I like the stop control button on the handle. The jet power is just right for blasting leftover food from between my teeth. I have had similar waterpiks before, but this one is the best so far."
4,Mr C,Product was as described. Nice to work with and easy to use. Had a wp when first came out in 1970. New one is less force which I find better as does not damage gums. The water container could be larger but works. Would recommend.
1,Does not work,"The water flow was not consistent , sometimes strong, sometimes weak. I tried 2 weeks and expecting it was going to be smooth but still not as good as the old interplake that I had. So I returned it."
2,Same as flossing,Had one of these mucho years ago and never really used it.Thought there may have been vast improvements but not really.My dentist recommend this in addition to flossing but I got to tell you that flossing which is essential does the same as this. This will go on the shelf and won't get much use.
5,Waterpik is great,The waterpick is great...I use it all the time and the dentistsaid it makes a big difference in the amount of placque on myteeth. Almost none....it's great.
4,WP is More Criitical Choice than a Mere Bramd of Toothpaste,My Waterpik is so satisfying and easy to use and I do indeed use it so much more often than I would normally brush my teeth...It's gratifying to have gums that no longer bleed...I'll use this little machine til I do wear it out and purchase it's replacement when need be...
4,water flosser,"The Waterpik water flosser is adequate and performs as expected. The only difference noted,(compared to my old Oxycare), is that the pressure has to be turned all the way up to the highest number 10 to get the same pressure I got on my Oxycare at number 7."
1,Amazon is a worst company,"I never thought Amazon is such a worst company. Worst customer support, never buy either this item or other items from Amazon."
3,It is fine. I'm not thrilled though.,"I used it for a week and now it sits on the counter. It is loud, kinda messy, and didn't do much for me.There is nothing bad about this product and if you have bleeding gums I would recommend it. If you don't have gum issues this probably won't do anything a Sonicare, floss, and Listerine won't do."
3,Decent device,"I like it, but as its for my 6 year old I'm writing it on her behalf. Difficult to use, button on the handle to stop flow is hard to keep depressed and the machine seems to be inconsistent with pressure."
3,It sprays water...,"This is my first Waterpik. I guess I don't know what I was expecting - my hygenist recommended it because my cleanings are pretty painful - I have gum issues. But it hasn't exactly blown my mind in any way, and I can't see that the effect is much different from swishing a little water around in my mouth, which can be done without taking up so much precious bathroom storage space."
1,Weak,Bought the lower end water pic $25 weak spray so I ordered this model and it is weak alsoVery disappointed looking for a different brandWould not recommends his or buy another oneCrap
1,Not worth the price.,"I have been using this water pick for the last two months, I consider it a piece of junk,It leaks terribly and no way to fix it."
1,Waterpik Definitely Overrated,"The ""Ultra"" Dental Water Pick is a rickety plastic device that works poorly. Although the instructions warn one not to ""pick"" for over 5 minutes at a time, the water bin barely holds enough water for 2 minutes. You have to jiggle it get it to work properly. The picture looks as if it is a highly developed machine, but it is really a primitive piece of junk."
3,Does what it's supposed to,This is a good unit though not as sturdy as i would like for it to be. You can often feel slight seperation of the hand unit when the unit is running. nice sized tank works perfect for single use. (note: if you add a little mouthwash to the warm water your mouth feels much much cleaner after using it)The attachments work great and i find myself using most of them for their intended uses.Only operates off of 120V so don't travel overseas with it and plug it into 220v
4,It Works Well,"This unit has less water pressure than my old one, but is sufficient. Plenty of water capacity. The unit does what it is advertised to do, so I am satisfied."
5,Waterpic Ultra water flosser,I had an earlier model of a Waterpic which I liked but damaged by dropping it. I ordered this model as a replacement and like it even more. It has a smaller footprint and love the On/Off switch. My teeth feel so clean and smooth when I am done.
5,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser - Perfect if hate regular flossing,"Well , there is nothing to hide here , I do brush regularly , but flossing , well that was a different story. and was reminded every time I go to dentist. This product changed flossing for me.Hats off to it, it bring out leftover from hard to reach place from even brush , I wish somebody suggested this to me earlier. well spent money on dental care."
4,It cleans!,"Well, if you really want to make sure you have 100% clean operating system this is the way to go. Use it with lukewarm water and not so hard at least once a day usually at night before retiring.Get it!"
5,Very good Flosser. My teeth love it,Its a very good buy and good product. The number of attachments you get are sufficient for any type of use. I use it few times a week and my wife uses it daily. Very good product and my money was well spent on this one. Not had any problem with this on so far.
4,water pik,"waterpik works well, it was a replacement for an older model and works better than our original. We also like the additional tips for cleaning under your gums. It pulses which seems to get more of the debris from between teeth."
3,Water piks are water piks,"All waterpiks do the same job. This waterpik has some additional features such as ""many"" different tools which I may never use. It's a selling feature to put addititonal ""tools"" to make it more saleable. The one thing I don't like about this waterpik is the on-off switch. I'ts difficult to turn it off without holding on to the tank. The switch should have been turned so it goes off and on in a vertical state."
5,Finally,I use to hate to floss my teeth but now I look forward to it everyday...This product is easy to use and clean. This is great for people having problems with conventional floss.
1,Don't Pick Waterpik,This product was great out of the box but it broke and leaked all over the place after less than a few months.What a waste of money.
1,Stopped working in less than a month,"I was perfectly happy with this product until it stopped working on me after 3 weeks of use. There is no water damage, still is in perfect condition. I am totally perplexed as to why this happened."
