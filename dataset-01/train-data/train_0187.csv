1,Lindsay Lohan is hot...,"and her acting believable. That doesnt get her far on this album though. The only song with any potential is the first single off the album ""Confessions of a Broken Heart."" That song you can feel the truth and pain and it breaks your heart... brings you to a place where you relate, and fix her words to your own memories. The other songs on the album are crap. A thrown together collaboration of diddies to impress the plastic teenage angst generation, none of which are appealing...more like nauseating. I mean, most people will hear older albums and compare the new one and say ""Much better"" ""She's older"". Wow, that's insight - of course she's older...but age doesnt improve song writing/composure...and where the content may have matured, the important things have not. Her voice is as pleasing as her appearance...but she needs to really look into her self to get something worth writing about. Lindsay, think ""Confessions....heart"" and stay on the track this time."
5,Lindsay Lohan Rocks!!!!,This CD is really awsome she is a really great singer and the remake of Edge Of Seventeen she did is really cool!
2,Terrible attempt by Lindsey,"This CD is a copy cat of Christina Aguilera's last album Stripped... even the name of the album gives the idea. She tries to tell of an abusive past in a song, but she's a little late. Her as well as Kelly Clarkson. If you want to listen to songs with more depth in the writing, and incredible singing voice to go along with it, try listening to Christina's ""Stripped""."
2,From Daddy,"Lindsay,It's daddy. I love you! I want you to know how proud of you I am. You took my advise and got the best producer you could get, and he makes it a great sounding record. I mean, when I would come home from jail, and hear you singing in your bedroom, I mean, I never would guess that is you. Those producers really did a great job with your voice. It ""almost"" sounds like you, but it does not really sound like you at all, which is great.... since you can't sing. I remember being a little sad with your Good Morning America lip sync job. But boy! Those producers sure did good.Well, gotta go to the chow line now. Hope I don't get shanked! I will be out soon. Can't wait to manage you again! Maybe we can go on tour with Hanson! Or Nick Lachey! Till then...Love,Your dad -#0526356312"
5,Star studded sophomore release!,"I really, really, love this album. Every song is aweseome, and they're all so different. The theme is perfect and I love how Lindsay took part in songwriting and production. She did an excellent job. It certainly carries on the more ""Raw"" handle. It connects with a deep faction in my heart. Bravo!"
5,I love it! 5 STARS!!!,"I love Edge of Seventeen. She sounds sweet on 'A Beautiful Life' and this album is WAYYY better than Speak. I had I live for the day stuck in my head all day. This CD rocks, and you can tell that there was a lot of effort put into it. A+"
2,not that good,"This cd has it's good songs but it has more bad songs. I got this cd because I liked Over off her first cd but this cd kind of sucks. There are about 3 songs I like out of all 12. So if your looking for a good cd don't look to Lindsay Lohan's ""A Little More Personal (raw)"""
5,omg lindsay effin lohan <3,"This is an amazing cd.It puts ""Speak"" to shame.With awesome lyrics that people can put into contrast with their own lives.One of the best cds I have heard this year.I didnt push the skip track button once."
1,last album was better,too many ballads for her weak voiceI was very disapointed when I purchased this albumI loved her other songs these new songs are lame at besther voice sounds terrible and most of the songs are just way too goofy
3,The planted reviews,I think That the review below is right about the planted reviews. The 3 customer reviews which surround him are done by people with just one review. Thats actually pretty rare for a person to have only one review. I stopped there because its sad enough that I clicked on the page to see a bigger pic of the album cover and ten minutes later here I am.
1,One thing upsetted me,"Stevie Nicks is one of my favourite artists, and apparently, someone cloned her. Lindsay's voice is nothing compared to stevies and yet, edge of seventeen is in both of their albums. Lindsay totally took all the credit, because she's a more recent singer."
1,blah blah blah blah,[...]I have to say this album is awful. Looks like everyone loves because oh boo-hoo boo-hoo she sings about her parents. Well guess what she didn't even write that Confessions of a whatever song. She uses voice improvements for her entire CD. She is an untalented [...] needs to go back to Disneyland.
1,AWFUL,Lindsay..you can't sing. Stop it with these idiots acting like thy are all Celine Dions. Grow up. You make me so embarrassed of American Entertainement.What a sad sad world.
3,Taking time helps,"Ok, so I wasn't too crazy about Lindsay's debut album, after listening to it only once, I could tell it was rushed and thrown together. However, on this album, it obviously is more personal, as the title of the album suggests. It's not a dance album, and there are some sad songs, such as ""Confessions of a Broken Heart,"" about Lindsay's relationship of lack thereof, with her father, Michael. She does a rockin' cover of Cheap Trick's ""I Want You To Want Me"", (heard it before? Letters to Cleo covered it for the film 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU.)This album is deeper with emotions and a sincerity in it that was lacking on ""Speak."" I really like listening to her album."
1,poop my scoop,"this is stupid, i got it and hated it. i do not reccomind this junk.C R U N K ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
5,A Beautiful Album (La Bella Vita),"Haha! This album is so beautiful. My favorite song is the last song. It really is more personal, and a lot of people can relate to it. It really rocks, you won't be dissapointed."
1,Sure is raw..,"Umm..RAW RAW RAW.. Horrriblayyy!!!!! NvR AgAn LoHaN!BouGhT ThS CD && WaZ DiSaPoInTeD ShE CnT SiiNg @ AlL. AcTuLy It iS SoOo MuCh FuN To SiT && LaUgH @ hEr HoRRiBle VoiCE!!! NOT JOKING>> I OWN THIS CD >> pshh the Ashlee simpson, lohan, and Duff. they can't sing for Magic BeAnz (U SHOULD GO BUY SUM MAGIC BEANZ 2!!! THEY R COOL.. NO JOKE)"
1,Bubblegum pop= talentless genre from start to finish,"I never liked Lindsay Lohan and I don't see any difference between her and Hilary Duff. They are both talentless whores who represent everything wrong with the music and movie industries today. This album along with Hilary Duff's absolutely dreadful ""Most Wanted"" are both two of the worst CDs to come out this year. Lindsay Lohan is also a dreadful actress as well. I can't believe 50 Cent wanted to date her because he is so much more talented and has so much more going for him than this stupid b!tch will ever have. Avoid this along with all of her other albums as well."
1,who the hell is giving all these 5 star reviews?,"I see no one wants to buy her album and since her dad is in jail and can't give her any money I'll bet her PR people are desperately trying to brainwash the american public into buying this album so they're writing reviews everyday to influence the young minds to spend their allowance money on this garbage. Do yourself a favour and don't fall for it. Stay away from this garbage pop music, and don't you dare even compare her to someone like kelly clarkson, you've got to be kidding me!buy mariah or mary j blige's CD's or even kelly clarkson if you want to hear someone who can actually sing soulfully"
5,What an Artist!!!!,"Lindsay Lohan has matured so much since her last release ""Speak.""Don't get me wrong, ""Speak"" was a great album, but this album explores Lindsay's deep personal feelings. She has opened up a new world of Lindsay that we have never heard of seen before. I think the album is one of the best album's I have ever bought in my life. The cd is awesome. She mentions GOD for the first time in a song, and it is great that she is including the almighty Lord. For He gives us everything. She covers ""I Want You to Want Me"" and ""Edge of 17"" wonderfully. She is very talented. This album has great rock elements with a hint of sexy. She is very talented, if you are a fan of Raw music, you will love this album."
1,Trying too hard,"Lindsay Lohan's singing is just plain awful. She sounds like she's trying way too hard to sound ""raw"" and ""angsty"". I tried listening to all the tracks on this album but after the third song I gave up. The first three trcks sound identical, and the fact that she had the nerve to do a remake of Stevie Nicks' ""Edge of Seventeen"" just really gets under my skin. Stevie Nicks has class AND talent, 2 things which Lohan lacks completely, so to ruin a song that was perfectly fine just the way it was seriously irks me. Skip this garbage entirely and check out Stevie Nicks instead. You won't be disappointed."
3,Defending Lohan and It's Okay.....I Guess,"I would never review music, but I felt bad at all the people knocking her. I don't think this is a terrible CD. I do think that this may very well be Lohan singing. Her voice is decent but just flawed enough that I think it is genuinely hers. The songs aren't terrible, they are actually listenable. Her cover of the Stevie Nicks song was actually sort of good. I guess her biggest problem is that they are very forgettable. I would never buy it, but if it was given to me for free I would keep it. This is probably best for mom's that are looking for something to buy their tween's that isn't completely and uberly sexed up."
5,Awesome album!,"I would say it's probably one of the best albums of the year. She isn't as good as Kelly Clarkson, but her style isn't really the same as Kelly's. Kelly sings a completely different genre in my opinion. Kelly's is more vocal performance, while Lindsay's is more just general performance. Anyway, it's a good album, the songs are excellent. :)"
1,stop making music,u suck stop trying to battle hilary duff hilary will always be better than u i hope u read this ms lohan
1,oh god who IS reviewing this?,Lindsay isn't a bad actress at all I do enjoy her movies but music is not her thing at all. Although her voice isn't bad like hilary and ashlee I thought she was going back to school to take a break from music and movies. Her confessions video was sad and she looked really freaky like she was trying to be punk or victorian but I saw right through it.
2,Halfway matured,"Lohan returns to (mostly) baffle music critics again, this time with a seemingly more ""mature"" look and sound. In the opening tune, the piano ballad gives way to a strong ""heart-wrenching"" chorus, where she's actually touching upon a genuine subject matter that a lot of young folks might connect with, but chances are it's gone largely unnoticed and dismissed. The bad news is that it keeps going on like that - rock-ballads with soft, everyday ""dilemma"" verses and strong, ""sing your heart out""-choruses. The only time it really shines is in when she's covering superior artists, putting a spin on ""Edge Of Seventeen"", or when she returns to the more dance-floor oriented sound on ""Who Loves You"". Stop with the fashion stuff, Linds - come back and finish up your electronic dancepop album, that might finally be something."
1,This is NOT REAL POP MUSIC!,"Sorry folks but this is not real pop music. The Thrills, The Killers, The Cars, those are real pop bands. How about you try listining to that instead of letting radio spoon feed you with this stuff."
1,Similar to Kelly Clarkson? HELL NO!!,"Don't listen to those CRAZY fans saying that Lindsay is the ""new"" Kelly... I mean really crazy, cuz there's just no way you can compare a true gifted and talented artist like Kelly to someone who can barely sing live like Lindsay...This album is regular, nothing special to it, but it ain't crap as well... just okay... unlike Kelly's latest album ""Breakaway"" wich is just amazing!Honestly, reading that Lindsay sounds like Kelly... just makes me sick... more sick than hearing this album..."
4,It's really not that bad.,"I know, I know...Lindsay Lohan putting out an album. But don't equate her to Hillary Duff or God Forbid, Ashlee Simpson, Lindsay's album is pretty good. I found it a lot more enjoyable than ""Speak"".Something about ""edge of 17"" I just love and have been listening to it over and over again. Admitedly I am not familar with the original, so I am going to try to get my hands on a copy of that.Other great songs are ""Confessions of a Broken Heart"" ""a Little More Personal"" ""I live for the day"" and ""Who Loves you"".If you enjoy crappy pop music like I do, you will probably enjoy this cd. It's not as bad as some and much better than most in this category."
1,"As ""Raw"" as it gets.","Alright, it's been a turbulent year in Lindsay Lohan's life, what with her dad going to the slammer, she having a weight problem, then coming out and admitting it (which is good, don't get me wrong), dying her hair that nasty blonde and putting on make-up that a cheap floozy would wear. Her first album sucked big time but the MTV kids still ate it up.Oh, the music! Yes, onto the album! Well, this is about as intense as it gets. Forget about polished vocals, synthetic instrumentals and shallow lyrics. Leave THAT to Hillary Duff. This is gritty, raw, intensene and even hardcore. Lindsay shows here she can sing without the magic of computers and vocal correction programs.(pause)I lied."
5,Seriously Impressed!!!!,"This album was much better than her 1st. Lindsay did an AWESOME cover of I Want You To Want Me. I personally think it's even better than the original by Cheap Trick. She also did an excellent cover of Edge of Seventeen. While no one could possibly singout Stevie Knicks, she did a pretty kick-a$$ version! Other flipping sweet songs were Beautiful Life, A Little More Personal, Confessions of a Broken Heart, and Who Loves You. This is certainly one of my all time favorite albums, and I can tell you that you won't be disappointed!"
5,Impressed!,"So, I'd like to say when I bought her first album I was soo disappointed it sucked big time LOL to be honest! But then I saw she had this new one coming out and I was like ok , I'll give the second one a try and see. I was totally impressed it was GREAT! I live for the day has to be my personal favorite and least favorite is My Innocence. But you should definately check this cd out!"
3,Wow.,"This set is very surprising. I expected the 'my childhood was horrible' portion (I am not bashing this topic, but singers do not have to belt it out in a song), but I surely did not expect such a solid album from Lohan. Though a handful of tracks seriously do not belong, the rest fit together to perform a true and solid rock album.1) Confessions- Deep, but not original. 7/10.2) Black Hole- Grungy and light at the same time. 8/10.3) I Live For...- Slick and edgy. 8/10.4) I Want You...- Does not fit; very strange. 4/10.5) My Innocence- Moving and light. 8/10.6) A Little...- Does not fit, but good. 6/10.7) If It's Alright- Good, but a little boring. 7/10.8) If You Were Me- A little strange, but okay. 6/10.9) Fastlane- Just okay. 6/10.10) Edge Of 17- Though not as good as the original, it is very dazzling. 9/10.11) Who Loves You- Does not fit; but okay. 6/10.12) La Bella Vista- Good, but plain. 7/10.82/120 - 68%: ***"
5,Actually a really good buy!,"I am glad I bought it, the music is definately (RAW). With time it will find much success."
1,HORRIBLE AND ARTIFICIAL.....DO NOT BUY!!,WOW! I am amazed that there are so many good reviews here. They must be planted by her die hard fans and friends/family members. This cd is awful- her voice is bland- and she has no vocal range whatsoever. She sounds like every other teeny bopper wanttobe musician today- she is overproduced and has no real talent. When I saw her perform at the american music awards- I was convinced that my opinion of her is correct. She is horrible live- and is way too cocky for my taste- especially when she does not have the talent to back it up. While I put her above the nasally untalented britney spears-- she is no Kelly clarkston or carrie underwood. This album is a D-.
5,Better than speak,Her first album stunk but this is better.Way better.My favorite is song is confessions of a broken heart (daughter to father)Add this to your collection!
5,lindsay,this is one of the best cd from lindsay. it shows lindsay's personal side. you should get it.
2,there are better artists out there,she is in a category with hilary duff and ashlee simpson but out of the 3 lindsay's voice isn't that bad. The music on this CD is a headache though and in the first single video she looked like a scary wannabe-victorian doll. I prefer lindsay lohan in movies much more than in music.
1,who are you all? girly girls?,she's a pretty girl with good acting skills but her musical skills aren't good enough to make an album. Though her voice is medicore it's no different from any random person singing in the shower
3,Good but....,"this is pretty good. However, there are a few things that i don't like baout this CD. i don't like how she talks about her father in a bad way. You know, no one really wants to hear that because some have good fathers and it hurts them to hear stuff like that. I know there are a lot of people out there with bad father's but don't make this song and remind them of that. This CD is pretty good though. It has a nice vibe and I read in a magazine that this CD wasn't that good but I guess they don't know what they are talking about because this CD is rated 4 and 1/2 stars. I think it will get to 5 stars after these Holidays because there are people getting this for Christmas and if it's almost at five stars now i think it will be at five stars.*good job lindsay! please don't do anymore songs about bad people in your family. i still think you did a goood job though!!!!!"
2,Your kidding me..,u cant honestly compare her to kelly clarkson with a straight face. kelly clarkson can sing..and shes amazing..lindsay lohan is alrite. I'll agree that she's better than hilary duff but thats all im giving her
2,"Almost, but not quite.","Having just done a review for Hilary Duff's latest upheaval of musical crap, I have a little more pity for Lindsay Lohan - her voice has some potential, but it sounds like she's shouting rather than singing. ""Daughter to Father"" really sounds like decent songwriting, but she's yelling! The vocals are a little unnerving. The songs are lackluster for the most part, but not terrible.And can someone please explain the album cover to me?"
5,i'm not a kid actually...,"i'm 20 years old actually... i like this album so much... i hated her first album actually but her sophoremore album is actually great. i like all the songs except the remake 'i want you to want me'. i just think that the original version is better. i highly recommended this album. my fav songs is black hole, i live for the day, beautiful life, who do you love, my innocence and fastlane. this album deserved a 5 star. but i don know what the others think because im not an axpert in music. i give this album a 5 star coz i'm enjoying this album and i couldnt even remember how many times had i played this album"
4,The revelation of the divas,"Through all my years of listening music, I'm very surprising with new songs. Some sucks, other are listeneables, but this album is the confirmation of something I recently discover: nowadays, the artists are trying to expose their problems to make a impressive catharsis with the people. The first time I listened to this album, I didn't like it because the songs are so weak with the essence of the song, but I listened too many times and I realize that the poor sound is according to the darker side Lohan's trying to present us: the personal point of view of a teenage drama queen"
4,Oooops ... Wrong Item Pictured,"The item pictured is the Nikon Universal Adapter. I ordered it and received a Nikon Adapter. A simple L-bracket with two threaded holes for the tripod and a captive bolt with thumb wheel for the binoculars. Curiously, it was what I was shopping for so I was satisfied and didn't return the item. It does its job but is over priced so four stars."
2,This guys writing is for the birds,"Reading this I am reminded of people you meet that talk just to hear themselves speak this book reminded me of those people. From the start you are engulfed in babble about Andrew Jackson. Even though this is considered a scholarly book, I feel that the writer just typed and typed and used words and sentences that were difficult to understand just to make himself sound important and intelligent. After reading this book I did not have a grasp on who Andrew Jackson was, but I did however know that I did not like the author."
1,It's a bit like a log.,"This book has its interesting moments, but seems to be quite bland at times. If read for school, don't become discouraged too easily. The true meaning of the book is brought together later by the author. All in all, the book was rather bland to me, but I'm simply one reader. Find out for yourself."
2,what?,"I'm really surprised that this book has received only positive reviews. I found the writing/punctuation style to be incredibly stupid and annoying. It looks like this: Today I woke up and took a shower. with hot water. at four in the morning. and it was fun. I don't understand why he would do that, it just looks weird and makes the narrator sound kind of airheaded.In addition, I thought the author was insecure about writing female characters or something; I thought he would just randomly put in sappy/wimpy-sounding lines because he thought he had to.I was super disappointed by this book because Pure Sunshine is awesome and beautifully written."
3,"Ok, the end saves it.","The book is written in a style of prose that is not for everyone, although I enjoyed it. Really seemed like a young teenage girl was narrating. However, it was extremely dry and boring throughout most, though that may be how life on the streets really is. The ending, though not complete, it does not need to be...it saved the novel for me. Otherwise, I would have thought it was a wasteful read."
3,what's up,"Use a little caution with this CD. It has difficulty playing in older CD Players. The format is not totally compatible I couldn't play it on my CD Player even after a replacement, but I could play it on my computer. The second CD Thunderbirds 2 worked fine on both. The Music is fine, the mechanics of the CD are iffy."
2,Langue,Serait-il possible de trouvé les soundtrack mais en franais.Etant jeune j'écoutais la TV mais c'est introuvable .Merci a vous tous !!!!!!!!
3,A Guide to Business Principles and Practices fro Interior Designers,This is a book I used when I was in design school. I got it for a re-fresher to use at my job; since I long ago got rid of the copy I used to have. Good resource when making contracts.
2,No Instructions Included,"Are we supposed to intuitively know how to use this steamer, or are there instructions online somewhere? Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I find instructions useful items to include with products. Also, the aluminum pot I received has about a 2""x1""x1/8"" dent on one side and the basket has an indelible ""GE"" written on the rim in black Sharpee - nice touch! My expectations were obviously not met. Now to figure out how to make rice with this (huge!) thing!"
4,Wonderful Product !,"First off I should say I never give anything 5 stars, nothing is perfect. And lets face it , their isn't a whole lot to these 2 items, but without one or the other it wouldn't really be possible to cook that awesome sticky rice. As long as you keep the items clean and don't abuse them(espeacially the bamboo basket) it will last a long, long time. And for all those novice sticky rice cookers... Soak the rice in Hot water for 1 hour. Put it in the basket after water is boiling and cover with any standard pot lid. Let cook for 10 min, flip the rice to the other side and cook for 10 more min. ENJOY !"
1,Did not cook my rice,"Maybe my water is too hard,but after boiling and boiling, the rice never cooked. I would not recommend this unless you have used an item like this before."
3,Sticky Rice Steamer Pot,Item is much larger than I had anticipated from looking at the picture. Seems like you could feed a small village with this thing. Way too big. Getting a mediocre review solely based on size. Haven't actually used the product.
4,need some kind of storage cover,Like this product. Used it a few times. But wish it could come with some kind of storage bag cuz I can't seem to find anything big enough to cover it so that dust won't collect on it while it's not being used.
4,Good product but not the best online merchant,"We ordered this item a few years ago from the Wok Shop. It makes great, traditional sticky rice. A week ago we decided to order two more as Christmas gifts from the Wok Shop through their web site (at the time we weren't aware that they were also selling on Amazon). Several days later we were informed that the item was out of stock and wouldn't be available until mid January 2010. As a consumer and occasional online seller myself, I expect them to keep better control over their inventory. Don't order this item if you need it in a hurry. But, if you can wait, it's just fine."
4,My Favorite Singer Neil Diamond,I have been a fan of Neil Diamond's since the 1960's and I try to read everything that's written about him.A good deal of the information in the book I read previously but there was some new information and the author gave a different slant in presenting it.For a true Neil Diamond fan they will find the book a good read.
4,"Neil Diamond, His Life, His Music, His Passion","This is not a biography. This is how the author thinks he feels about his life, his music, his passion."
4,Geeky but Great,"A thorough and valiant attempt at trying to define ""terroir"" in one of the world's great winegrape growing regions.I liked the book a lot more than I thought I would--it starts with the soils and geologic makeup, goes into climate, viticulture, and then tries to bundle it with how the grape growers and winemakers coax great fruit out of all of it.Fabulous maps and graphics. Worth the price for this alone.Terroir is a very difficult topic to get ones head around and I really appreciate the authors' work. A lot closer than you get from talking to grape growers and wine makers. (I have been an amateur winemaker for over 10 years, so I really appreciated the clarity of their approach.)"
4,The Winemaker's Dance: Exploring Terroir in the Napa Valley,"yes, this book can not tell you everything about the wine, but at least, this book does provide a basic knowledge of relationship between terroir and the character of wine. If readers who are really interested in wine and terroir, you might buy another book called"" Terroir, The Role Geology, Climate, and Culture in the Making of French Wine."" by James E. Wilson."
2,A waste,"These ""scientists"" had the support of the Napa Valley Vintners Association, who apparently didn't tell them that theories without solid data to back them up are essentially worthless. They wasted a lot of time on this book - don't you do the same."
3,Jamaican punch,"Cecily Baron is the daughter of the house of Nettleton, a family who has headed the social and economic life of Jamaica since colonial days when the sugar farming was carried out by slaves. She accompanies her father Archie, a faded minor movie star to a reunion in the plantation house which is now occupied by her aunt, a gently decrepit former grande dame and Marsden, Archie's son by a former marriage. Marsden has great plans to restore the old house to its past glory by turning it into a luxurious casino, backed by the mafia. Cecily is reunited with an old lover Paul,a part Jamaican politician who is activelt trying to end U.S. dominance of the island and who is the target of trouble makers, intent on murder and mayhem.It's a light story which reads a bit like an old Bette Davis melodrama!"
3,PURE PLEASURE,"THIS DVD FOLLOWS THE SAME PATTERN AS THE PREVIOUS ONES DID.BEAUTIFUL VALETS BUTT NAKED IN STRIPPING ROUTINES.THIS WILLDEFINATELY KEEP YOU AT FULL ERECTION, I MEAN FULL ATTENTION.ENJOY"
4,pretty...sick,"damn sick-maybe a little over the top with all the spoken words mixed with brutal hardcore singing-but at least theyre not singing like ... all these bands seem to be doing now-adays..to get it str8 if you like sepultura,god forbid,santa sangre,hatebreed,until the end, youll dig this! a mix of old school heavy with new school hardcore.plus a song that statrs out emo then gets hella heavy-its pretty sick too...youll like"
5,Get inside the heads of this amazing family,"This book is a remarkably intimate study of a family in Mexico City. How Oscar Lewis managed to get them to open up about their experiences, fears, loves, hates, dreams and suffering in such explicit detail is a mystery. Lewis must have assisted them to articulate their feelings and perspectives because their tales are beautiful to read. Five members of the Sanchez family give independent accounts of their lives of hardship. The same events in their lives are viewed from each family member's perspective providing a unique insight into the familie's life. It is particularly amazing how openly they talk about each other. I have to assume that none of them will ever read the book. Reading the account of their lives is a sociological experience that is difficult to imagine getting from a book but also a beautiful piece of writing. In my opinion a unique and outstanding achievement ."
1,Autobiography?,As Oscar Lewis is not one of the Sanchez children you will be disappointed if you are expecting to read a narrative of his life. This is not an autobiography.
5,A great read!,"This is a page turner! Don't be fooled, this book isn't just for women, nor is it a cook book. In fact, it's perfect for men who want to get a taste of what goes on inside the mind of a middle aged woman who is looking for love, sex and romance -- but not necessarily in that order. It's a funny story about a kidnapping that takes just the right amount of unexpected turns."
3,Satisfactory,This tank holder is just as pictured. It is pretty cheap. 20oz tank is a tight fit. Won't fit my 45ci high pressure tank.
3,***One Pilots Take***,This book is a look back for a GAF pilot and his dealings with testing and R&D on captured aircraft...the author is expresses himself very naturally and is a very easy read the info contained is although not extremely revealing but a good look back on how things where and his take. The verbal method he uses is quite refreshing in a lot of ways he is blunt and to the point with a little humor thrown in which as said makes this a very easy read...I was hoping against hope to read more on the KG200 the Luftwaffes' secret wing that used captured aircraft against the allies but there is very little out there on the subject other than novels which after all this time must be still under wraps for obvious reasons. So that being said I give it five stars for how it was written but two for info ergo the three...lets call it three point five.
1,Wasted Talent,"These women are seriously talented! It's too bad their label saddled them up with a horrible selection of songs and producers. How many different orchestra hits came free with that keyboard? Then they don't seem to know how to promote One Voice (or don't believe it's worth trying at this point). I feel bad for the group, and can only hope that they are allowed to do better work next time. At this rate, the taste for Filipino talent from the Bay is going to become over-saturated real quickly. One Voice needs to keep taking new steps the way they did with their first album, and artists like Pinay and Jocelyn Enriquez have done in the past. This is just wasted talent."
5,Dope!!!!,"One Vo1ce's sophmore debut ""Sincerely Yours"" is definitely one of my favorite albums at the moment. I picked it up in June, and I was so impressed. All of the songs are unique and different in sound. The album is R&B flavored with Pop and Hip Hop influences. Standout tracks include ""So Badd"", the catchy ballad ""Thru It All"", and the hot pop track ""Swing Your Love 2 Me"". There is also a track where the girls show off their talent in the ""Acapella Segment"". I had my chance on meeting them, and they are so sweet and nice. Catch their new album titled ""Loving You"" coming out in September of 2003. Also request their latest single ""No More"". Much love always 2 mah girls One Vo1ce!!! Repin VALLEJO baby!"
4,Pink Cook for the Cure whisk,"This is just the whisk I've been looking for~ solid, durable, and effective. It has a good hand-feel and of course, as a pink-lover, has just the right color!"
5,"A must-read for the ""steampunk"" shootist or firearms enthusiast","This classic of the bizarre in firearms design and production is finally back in print after a long time, and is worth the price...if one is into the aberrant, strange and ""steampunky"" regarding guns. As a steampunk ""Maker"" with a rotating barrel cartridge derringer conversion to my credit, there are loads of inspirations here for re-creations or designs for either dummy, blank-firing or live firing (if you live like I do in a state with less restrictive gun laws) firearms. There are also some offerings that, well, didn't work back in the olden days when they were tried, and probably won't work now either. Especially the sketches towards the end of Guns That Should Not Be done as a joke. (but IF you just want to make a dummy weapon that looks really really ""kewl"", well, fellow steampunks, that's a WHOLE different story!) Enjoy! -- Gregory Raden aka steampunk1914"
5,Wanted a good read on social/political/economic influences on beer: got it!,"As a lover of history and an interest in life in the middle ages, this book provided a great academic understanding of beer and its influence in Northern Europe. Caveat: I have a PhD in Geography so the book might be dry for people not used to academic writing."
5,Very good,"This book is just as good as the first. It is fresh and new, with interesting charactors. The begining of the book is so well written, that even if Kellis hadn't seen the raders at the gate, and if the book just continued with the events of the farm, it still would have turned out to be a five star novel. As it is, with Kellis' gift (I won't give it away) there is fast paced action, and many interesting events. I really liked the ending too. Great work!"
2,Art Glass,I was a bit disappointed in this book. Not at all for the beginning collector. Covers mainly very expensive pieces of glass. Not for the average person.
2,Not the best baby picture book,"I bought this book for traveling, because it's small and has a rattle to keep little ones occupied. While it WAS great for traveling and seemed to keep my 1 year old son mildly entertained, I only give the book two stars.My beef with the book is that the descriptions of the babies don't really match their expressions. For example, the picture that says ""happy"" shows a baby who looks a bit nervous and really isn't smiling. And many of the children look like they were hot and crying when their pictures were taken (they have flushed cheeks and worried looks on their faces). The title of the book, ""Happy Baby Faces"", isn't really fitting.Bottom line - I've seen other baby picture books that do a much better job than this one. You may want to look elsewhere."
5,This is my daughter's favorite book!,"Okay, I have to agree with the previous reviewer's critique of the ""happy"" baby. He doesn't look overjoyed. This is, however, something that my 1 year old just loves. She has had it for 6 months and it is always with her. She loves to look at the photographs of all the babies. It holds her attention, whereas the Baby Einstein books and others do not. Great size for taking in the car or stroller and very easy for her to carry. Great gift idea!"
4,Wonderful memories,"Like another reviewer, I first heard this CD around 1990 while perusing through a small gift shop in Eureka Springs, AR. My girlfriend at the time was with me, and we were both in college. We bought the CD and listened to it over the next several month during quiet times together.I have not seen her in over ten years, but I sometimes listen to this beautiful music and it takes me back to those wonderful memories. It is incredibly peaceful and romantic, with just a touch of flash at times to keep the idle listener curious and entertained.I highly recommend it, particularly if you are looking for soft mood music."
4,This is a cd that beautiful music lovers will cherish,"For his first cd, I would say that Danny was more than ready. It appears that he was past due to join the ranks of a recording star. This cd features a mixture of songs. It offers something for just about everybody. If you love classical music there is some of it here. How about show tunes? Well there are some of this music here. What about movie music? Right on, it's here also.The concept of this cd was brilliant. I think most people will like these performances. Danny, in my opinion, did a good job, especially for a debut cd. I just wish some of the other cds that I have in my collection by him would have turned out so good like this cd.I would like to offer a strong recommendation for piano lovers to buy this cd."
3,good for a museum exhibit's catalog,"This was the official catalog to a major museum exhibit and overall it's pretty impressive and covers a wide gamut of Byzantine art. It is, however, organized in a manner expected to an exhibit and while useful as a college-level art history textbook perhaps (which is the context in which I purchased it), it's a bit cumbersome due to its size as a text to actually read and learn about Byzantine artwork. In addition, as a paperback, it's a mighty hefty one. Be thus warned. Still useful if you're really keen on the period of art it covers."
3,On The Way Back,"Marah's 'Kids in Philly"" is one of my favorite CDs of all time. Their first CD, Cut the Crap, was also brilliant. For some reason, they tried to go commercial with Float Away---big mistake. 20,000 Streets is a ""comeback"" CD--not quite up to Kids standards, but pretty darn interesting.See them live---they do put on a great live show. I'm looking forward to their new release in Oct. or November, 2005. I hope they reach a new creative peak, a la ""Kids"" days."
4,Hurrah for Marah,"After recently seeing these guys in action, I have to say that they are one of the better original sounding bands that has hit the pub scene in quite a while. Energy. That seriously sums it up. They have got to be one of the only bands that I have seen that actually sound good on their CD, but even better in person."
3,Missing something,"For anyone who liked the other Folk Implosion albums, this one is missing something. The album is still good, and despite only having 9 songs, is still fairly long. But the songs aren't as catchy, and there is a fairly low amount of backing vocals since John Davis left. This one is more for the core audience, which is really all they have anyway. If you are reading this, you should get the album."
3,Dissapointing,"Say One Part Lullaby hadn't been born, this record might've got a 4 from me. Instead, that masterpiece, record of our time, incredible patchwork of trip hop beats, vocal harmonies and melodies ripped straight from the 60's happened, and this record seems very, very mediocre.I had high expectations, but without John Davis, things went downhill. It's a far more sebadoh/rocky album, so it may appeal to some, but apart from ""pearl"" and ""leaving it up to me"", there is as the waverace commentator would say, ""nothing special"". Pearl was better on the demo, too."
2,Christmas morning disappointment,"I purchased this train for my two sons who wanted nothing else but an electic train set for Christmas. What a disappointment. The lifts for the track do not securely fit into the underside of the tracks which results in the lifts slipping out from under the track and the train falling off the tracks. After attempting to rig up a way to secure the track, we set up the train. The engine arrived broken. The electrical component was loose and was sticking outside of the train. We had to fix the train before we could use it. Each time the boys want to use the train, we have to spend much time rigging it in such a way so it will run. Once we get it going, we're lucky to get the train around the track one time without it falling off. I would NOT reccomend this train set."
2,We were disappointed......,"I purchased this train set for my son for Christmas. The details on the cars, tracks and extras were beautiful and the quality of the set as a whole was great! But....it was SO frustrating to operate. You have to have the cars lined up EXACTLY on the track to make them move. When my husband was having trouble lining up the two sets of wheels on one car to get it to go, I knew we were in trouble. When we finally had things moving, we added a few cars - they fell off around the corners going only at medium speed. Great quality, Poor performance is my rating."
1,What a waste of money!!!!,I got this item for a special event and the night before the event it just decides to not work! I did all troubleshooting and nothing worked. There was power to everything and once the engine would touch the track it would not work!! So I spent the entire night before driving miles to find an electric train since this was to be the center piece for the event!!! So disappointed!!!!!
1,Train,"Very poorly made, bought this for my son for christmas. Description said easy interlocking pieces. NOT SO!! very difficult to put track together. The track does not stay together. Very disappointed!!"
4,Very Good,"It's very good,many levels,an excellent 3D Picture,but a little hard for little Kids. But overall,it's very good for kids about 9 Years old and up."
5,This game is the best! It is really thrilling!,This game has a lot of action and adventure. It keeps you on the edge of your seat!
5,Great introduction,"I've done enough climbing to be familiar with much of what the video covers, but I still thought it was very helpful. He broke things done really nicely, and certainly covered all the basics I can think of. I found it very helpful."
1,Not worth the money,"The adjustment buttons have always been difficult to operate. They take alot of pressure and are sometime just plain unresponsive. Now the alarm mode quit working. You could buy a dozen Casios for the money. They would look about the same, not be so difficult to adjust, and last longer."
5,Perfect,"Shorn of their orchestra, and having to rely on keyboard player Woolly Wolstenholme's amazing ability with the Mellotron and Mini-Moog to create the same effect, this album is an incredible example of necessity being the mother of invention. The sound they came up with is beautiful, timeless, and very powerful. John Lees turns in the best wah-wah guitar solo you'll find anywhere on ""For No One"", whilst Les Holroyd's song writing never got any better than the songs he offered here. Above all, this is music designed to be listened to in the same way as classical music - it too good for background music. One for the true music lover."
2,Poor man's prog-rock,"BJH is known to be more than influenced (obsessed, I would say) with classical music and to be able to integrate an orchestra into their compositions better than their peers (""Moody Blues"", for example). On the other hand the band was trading for almost 3 decades (since 1970) in lightweight uninspiring music and has managed to build a devoted following.At the early stage they were supported by John Peel (who had a weakness for oddities) and labeled as ""poor man's Genesis"".Honestly, I tried really hard to listen to BJH, but still I can't feel excited or inspired by this rather dull and shallow music, but it's a matter of taste"
3,"Sufficient , just not memorable, English Folk Rock","Barclay James Harvest's"" Everyone Is Everybody Else"" is a smooth, well-produced (for 1974) album of mostly forgettable tunes by a four-man English folk/pop outfit with only the slightest hint of progressive rock in their arrangements. (A mellotron here, a primordial synth line there and the occasionally time signature change). If you want to experience 70's English folk-prog at its best, get Traffic's "" John Barleycorn Must Die"" or The Strawb's ""Hero and Heroine""."
3,Early Nevil Shute,"MARAZAN was one of the very early Nevil Shute stories, from his days as a full-time engineer. It still has the Shute character and prose style, but not the polish of his later books.MARAZAN is written as an adventure story, set in pre-WWII England.This is not really a book I would recommend to a random reader, but a fan of Nevil Shute would enjoy it as I did."
2,A collector's item ruined by Televista's abysmally bad transfer,"This is a perfectly enjoyable (and so-far hard to find) little film, considered by some to be very much in character with the long-gone Ealing Comedies. I'm giving it 2-stars ... somewhere in between a 4 for the movie and 1 for the poor DVD transfer. It is ruined for me by the atrocious unrestored sound and picture quality of this transfer. The high price tag only adds insult to the injury. They've started out with a very poor print and have done nothing to improve it. The result is worse than we're used to seeing on most budget label low-speed VHS tapes. I'd recommend you buy a used DVD of this because it certainly isn't worth the asking price that Televista has placed on it. This one is so bad that in future I'll avoid any more of these Televista products until I see reviews that comment on the quality. They obviously can't be trusted to deliver a product that's in line with their asking prices."
2,Good Movie...Bad Transfer,"I really loved this dark British comedy. This is definitely Alfred Hitchcock worthy. Leo McKern is very good in the lead. Janet Munro is extremely delicious and enticing. Dennis Price is the perfect snob. Unfortunately, 3-4 minutes have been edited from the transfer and the sound is a bit out of sync. If you can live with these flaws, you should purchase it as there are no other options."
5,Amazing sound from a small package,"This is my first real surround sound setup, but I know quality when I hear it.Just bought these along with a Velodyne VX-10 sub and a Onkyo SR605 receiver in a 7.1 setup and they sound great. Center is nice and clear for dialog, rears are excellent for sound effects, and the left and rights are loud enough to hear transitions.I watched The Matrix lobby scene on HD-DVD and it was intense with these speakers.I had some problems with getting the ball-joint stands to stay where I wanted to, but they worked out in the end. I am happy they came with the ability to mount right out of the box and didn't need another part to accomplish this."
4,V good for price!,"You'll get spacious,wonderful and clear highs, good medium frequencies, not a powerful bass.The sensitivity is not quite high so they will need a powerful or a high current receiver/amplifier.A subwoofer is a must; you need to buy it separately.Nice finish and craftmanship."
4,Cheap Entertainment,"My granddaughter and I enjoyed these knock knock jokes (One of her favorite things) on the beach during our recent vacation. Great laughs, even when they're corny!"
2,Worlds Greatest...? Kind of misleading.,"Jokes are not very funny and I can not see why it is kid specific.? My opinion, but there has to be something better out there. My six year old won't pick it up."
1,:(,ugh. this whole book makes me want to vomit. i wanted to rate this 0 out of 5 stars but the minimum is 1 star. when i saw this i almost threw my kindle over the grand canyon. this book is a bunch of bull bull and more bull. this book is horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :(
3,It's Live,"An eternal AC/DC fan, I prefer to see them live, rather than to just listen to a live album. A good album."
3,Be careful when assembling!,"Installing this product requires some assembly, and the stamped sheet metal parts can be extremely sharp. They don't warn you about this in the instructions printed on the box. Thirty seconds into the assembly I was bleeding all over the fixture from superficial but bloody cuts, and had to stop to bandage my hand before continuing.The instructions refer you to the wiring diagram on the ballast for correct placement of the sockets in the fixture. Once the units were assembled they went in with little trouble, except that the punch-outs are not fully punched and are difficult to remove without bending the housing.I would be happier with these fixtures if the sheet metal were more substantial, although once they are in place, they are fine and work well."
4,"Large, Somewhat plain",A large triangular patch 8 inches wide and the same tall. (203mm x 203mm) Somewhat plain in colors and design compared to most of the other available space/NASA patches.Machine sewn on a thickness of cloth with a fully glued backing.Based on the opinions of a sewing and embroidery trades-person this patch with the faux metallic border thread is best used on a garment that will not see much washing or for placement into a scrapbook.
3,"Filter works, but too tight a fit","I agree with another review that while this filter is okay, but the fit on the locking tabs is too tight. To get it to lock properly, you will have to spend a minute filing the gap between the tabs and body just a bit. Otherwise, it is fine and I look forward to being able to wash out the filter instead of replacing it.I wish I could also find the foam cone filter that covered this one in the original equipment as well."
1,Not what I Thought it was...,This book was not anything like I thought it was. It some sort of weird comic with a super hero playing the girl who was broken up with... Very corny...Lame...I returned it and asked for a refund...
5,This is a really funny book that helped my friend.,"I gave this to a girlfriend and she really loved it. It's really light and graphically funny so you can just flip through it and read anywhere. It's a bit Monty Python-y in the way it's laid out, and a bit Roseanne in the way it's like tough girlfriend love. ""No you will not think of him. Yes we will go and have some fun."" That kind of thing. Plus it's got all sorts of stuff on personals and meeting people and getting out again so it's really a good way to fill in the gap as you're working your way to liking yourself again. It's kind of like a good friend who keeps things light when you need things kept light"
1,"Juvenile, Not Funny","I think of myself as having a great sense of humor and I just didn't see what could possibly be funny about this book. It starts out with a stupid comic strip and never gets better. If you are looking for editorial content, DON'T READ THIS! Seriously, this book is a compilation of dumb comics, sketches, etc. Very juvenile! There are much better books out there like the ""Between Boyfriends Book"" from a writer of Sex and the City."
5,"Intelligent, literate fantasy","Lillian Stewart Carl's impressed me with her well-thought-out, historically accurate fantasy ever since I first read her Amazon women-inspired _Sabazel_. Now, at last, we get her most important short fiction collected in a single volume. The genesis of _Sabazel_ is included here, along with several stories that display her affection for All Things Scottish. Witty and thoughtful, there are several major awards finalists included amongst these sophisticated tales. A good read -- I highly recommend it!"
4,Intersection of Love and Discord,"Karen Shepard creates an intriguing triad of women, united by images, dreams, and the spoils of unfulfilled dreams. United by a deceptive retrospective article of an aging photographer, three women return to the cabin in the country where Celine Arnaux once created a masterful series of photographs of her granddaughter, Cameron. Accompanied by Celine's daughter Sumin, and Cameron's would-be adopted daughter Alice, the women engage in a week of simmering tension and hidden secrets and ambitions.Shepard's style is graceful and full of the chiaroscuro that she evokes in the legacy of Celine's photography. Her descriptions are lifelike, and the emotions of her characters are palpable. A quick read, but stirring nonetheless."
4,Great Grill,"I'm deducting a point because I wasn't aware the grilling surface would be smaller to accommodate the smoker box. Other than that it's great.1. Easy assembly (1.5 hours in the dark)2. 600 degrees in ~15 minuets3. Plenty of work surfacesNo problems after the first seasonAnd hey, it's a Weber..."
2,Hagiography more than history,"Business is a ruthless business. Dog eat dog and all that. Extraordinarily successful businessmen may have the same basic character traits as their fellow men (and women) but often in more extreme forms. Some of these traits are admirable: ambitious, industrious, driven, resilient, clever. Some, not so much: greedy, cruel, ruthless, opportunistic, dishonest.Don't count on Brands to notice the latter in his subjects. H.W. Brands has written a history of American businessmen as they would like themselves to be seen. If you enjoy this book, you may also enjoy browsing the National Association of Manufacturer's press releases."
4,Masters of Enterprise,"I found this book very informative and well written. The best quality of the book is that each individual is described well enough to give you insight and from there you can decide whether you would like to read his or her biography, or just be pleased with what you have learned.I learned quite a bit of intresting facts about many of the leaders of industry and that, I belive, is the purpose of the book."
3,Sketches of Great American Entrepreneurs,"These brief portraits of great American businessmen and women are well written. Brands does a creditable job laying out the basics of each of their lives and presenting it in a highly readable fashion. His purpose is to show the historical development of how Americans have made money in a country where the making of wealth has became almost a divine calling.Brands' selection of business giants could have been better. He seems to have picked his membership more for their diversity as people than for their masterful entrepreneurial skills. Why include Berry Gordy, but not Warren Buffett? Brands' choices obviously skew his presentation of U.S. business history, making it seem more diverse than it really has been."
1,Don't Waste Your Money II,"We bought this because we have a new puppy. As sent, it was useless. Not even adult dog could get out. The problem is the hard plastic surface. When wet, it's slippery (doh!). The dogs can't get on it to get out of the water, and even when helped, they can't ""skamper"" out. We ended up buying a rough rubber door mat and lacing it onto the surface. Our pool has the same edge configuration as that in the illustration and promotional sales material doesn't make it clear that you have to drill holes in the concrete deck to place the anchors for the ramp. This product is a bad design poorly executed."
5,Great product,"Since we installed the Skamper Ramp we haven't come home to anymore suprise visitors floating in the pool skimmer basket. We actually had a frog using it as a beach for a few days until we brought him to a river about a mile from the house. Can't imagine not having one of these to save lives, it's great."
4,An Absolute Must Read Before Buying a Replica Cobra,"I found this book to be extremely helpful in weeding through the hype and high pressure sales tchniques that abound in the replica/kit car industry. Mr. Scott's reasoned, no nonsense guide is the necessary guiding light to making your replica car buying experience a satisfying one. The ""10 Golden Rules For Selecting and Purchasing Your Cobra"" article is, quite literally, the definative way to find an honest, quality kit car manufacturer. After a five year search for a reputable, quality kit and reading Mr. Scott's book, I was able to make an informed choice. That decision has paid untold dividends as I drive my Superformance Cobra Replicar. A knowledgable buyer is the unscrupulus dealer's worst nighmare. Be a nightmare, read this book."
1,What a self-serving LOSER book!,"Basically, this is a puff piece, a literary kiss on the rump, to anyone who PAYS Curt Scott for space in his book. It is a fraud and lacks any credibility on any level. I hope the FBI and the IRS see what this guy's doing to defraud the replica car lovers out there."
4,Some Excellent Songs,"Although not a huge success, this album contained some really excellent songs. My favorite is Heartbreak Station. Definately the best on the album. This song rocks live as well. Shelter Me is also a really great song as is The More Things Change. Tom Keifer and his band are really at the top of their game with this album. His scratchy blues/rock voice is so much better than all the singers throughout the decade of the 90's. I liken him to a cross between Black Crowes, ZZ Top, and AC/DC. Three other really awesome rock/blues bands. This is what great music is all about. Go see them live whenever you get a chance. Not one of those music festivals either with those short song sets. Go see them on their own like at the House Of Blues. Their website is http://www.cinderella.net Rock On!!!"
2,A Real Heartbreak,"Their third effort was a real let down. After two terrific albums, Night Songs and Long Cold Winter, Cinderella's time has passed. By getting away from the hard rock roots, this album just fizzels with just a song or two that stand out. Their previous albums contain 5-6 rockin songs each. This one is nothing but a dud that killed their career. To bad to. After they reached new heights musically on Long Cold Winter, everyone had such high expectations for this album. To get a feeling what Cinderella was all about check out their first two efforts."
1,HEARTBREAK RECORDING.......,"What a bad album. If you wanna really know what glam is all about, listen to this masterpiece of bad rock."
3,Heartbreak album,"I was a huge fan of Cinderalla in the 80's. Their first 2 albums are classic. So of course I was extremely excited when they put out a new album. I wasn't all that excited about the title track as the lead off single, but I bought the CD anyway. Probably should have waited until it made the cut out bin.The CD felt forced to me, like they had run out of material and just threw some songs together to fulfill a recording contract. Non of the songs are catchy or memorable in my mind. I have probably only listened to it 2 or 3 times since it came out. Hoping maybe it would grow on me, NOPE.I just recently saw them in concert, and they don't even play anything off of this collection. Should probably tell ya something. Get their first 2 CD's only get this if you are die hard, or looking to die hard.Sorry Cinderella, better luck next time, if there ever is one."
5,THIS BAND BLEEDS TALENT FROM EVERY PORE,"This is truly a great album by a great band. The music goes from blusey to rockin' and back again. This album shows the true genius of the band, mainly frontman and primary writer Tom Keifer with the great guitar riffs and poetic lyrics. A must have for any metal fan or any fan of wonderfully written music."
4,Metal with a touch or rock and roll,"Softer and more on the Rock and Roll side than previous CDs. They got the rhythm they got the lyrics, now all you need to get is the CD."
3,Third Time Certainly Not A Charm.,"I was sadly dissappointed with this album and only give it 3 stars. Perhaps it was the fact that I've listened to their first 2 albums for so long, but overall this album just doesn't get it done in my opinion. Give me the hard rocking Cinderella of old any day vs. this lightweight version. The title track, Heartbreak Station is indeed a great song but other than that the rest of the album just didn't do much for this hard rock fan. Many of the songs vocals are also very muffled and aren't nearly as clear as Cinderella's previous 2 albums. Here's hoping ""Still Climbing"" is much better. Despite the fact that it was a letdown, it's still much better than anything being released in today's hip-hop, bubble gum pop, whiny world of music."
2,Not enough resolution for the price,"Microscope Pen 100X magnificaiton uses 3 lens system to correct for image orientation. I bought one and since it uses 3 lens array system the resolution is very poor. There is a glow/blurring around the festure edges. I tried the Optima xP from Serenity Technologies (www.serenitytechnology.com) it has higher magnification power 120X and uses prism optics which is ideal for high resolution application and was able to get crisp clear image and observe sub-micron features. I would not recommend the Microscope Pen product, since for the same cost one can get a better product from Serenity Technologies"
5,Good for developing and strengthening friendships,"This is an excellent study that really focuses on Biblical friendships and what we need to do to develop them in our own lives. It has been wonderful for developing and strengthening the relationships within our group.The book suggests 90 minutes for each week, however I would recommend at least two hours (depending on the size of your group) to allow for the conversations to develop and the intimacy level to deepen.I'd definitely recommend this study for women who are looking to develop new friendships and for women who are looking to strngthen ones they already have!"
4,Unexpectedly pleased,"My children received this book as a gift from my aunt who brought it back from China in the 1980s. They loved the book that marked their childhood and we would read it almost every night. Somehow it disappeared and recently my now-24-year-old daughter said she wished she could read it & look at the illustrations again. By chance I entered the title and upon seeing the image of the cover, I immediately ordered it. It is in great condition, considering its age. The brightness of the illustrations are like new, as well as the overall condition of the book. My daughter was delighted."
5,I Love this DVD-ROM!,Fast enough! Quiet Enough! Slot loading! Rips CD audio to MP3's very fast! Copies to the hard drive very fast! No incompatibility issues. Great DVD-ROM!
3,Farflung - 'When Science Fails' (Transparency),"I'll assume this is probably another CD full of unreleased tracks that never made it onto any official disc.Similar to that of their '9 Pin Body' effort(see my review).Oh,it's not a bad CD.It has several,in fact just about every cut is decent.Like the trippin' ""Ant Lion""(maybe the disc's best track),""The Nation"",""Terminal"" and ""Something In The Water"".Fairly good industrial space rock,JUST as Farflung has come to be known for.Line-up:Tommy Grenas-guitar&vocals,Scott Rusch-keyboards,Ryan Kirk-bass and B.LaBelle-drums.Give it a listen.You won't regret it."
1,This book is terrible. I'm amazed at the rambling jibberish,Talk about a rambling piece of garbage. Mr. Csikszentmihalyi (who came up with that rediculous spelling?) has taken advantage of our capitalist society while promoting pure socialistic undertones in his book. Don't fall for the jargon. There is nothing here that is tangible or practical. It is by far the worst book I have ever read. Please spare yourself. There are many other self-help books out there with much more to offer.
3,A good book but can be more condensed.,"I read this book because it was mentioned in Dave Pink's ""Drive"". In ""Drive"", Pink outlined three ingredients for the ""flow"" experience: challenge of the right level, immediate feedback and a skill that can be mastered.After reading this book, I hardly got more than the above points. I was looking for a ""how to"" book about creating the flow experience. However, this book is really a life philosophy book, which uses ""flow"" as a paradigm to describe various aspects of life. The general point is very good: we need to create order in mind. And the way is to have a goal and an ""autotelic mindset"", manly, focus on the effort, not on external reward or punishment. Such mindset can be applied to physical, mental and social activities.Overall, the book does provide valuable insights. But it is quite verbose and repeating. If you just read the subtitles, you will get about 60% of what is talked about."
3,Audio book was a quick read,"I would classify this book as a notch above the typical pop psychology/self-help/Dr. Phil type of books that proliferate the market. The author does attempt to add some scientific research to support his claim. He does interview a variety of people and their vignettes are interesting to hear. The audio book was only two CDs long, so was a quick and enjoyable listen.But overall I found the message a bit disjointed. Part of the book talks about how happiness can be achieved from setting and achieving small goals. But then the other part of the book tries to connect that with being in the zone, as athletes and musicians are when performing their craft. I think these are two separate concepts and cannot be explained by a simple philosophy."
5,Brilliant book offers practical help,"This brilliant book by a leader in the field of happiness offers practical advice for how to achieve this through ""flow."" He writes in clear prose. I adore this book so that it is at the heart of my post on how to achieve happiness at http://drbremer.blogspot.com/2009/02/happiness-in-era-of-slumping-dow.html"
3,Good Ideas Badly Presented,"Be Pro-Active. Be Present. Follow Your Passion. Treat Everything as a Learning Opportunity, and Be a Lifelong Learner.These ideas are now so very much ingrained in our culture, and ""Flow"" confirms everything we know but in a convoluted, repetitive manner. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is a pathbreaking scientist, but his writing often verges on the mystic. It was a good book for the 1990s, but not so for the present."
5,Studies the history and current analysis of psychology,"A really interesting read, full of the history of psychology.It can be a bit of a slow read, unless you love studying and learning about psychology & the mind, because it has so many details about historic studies, that it reads a bit like a history book.It delves into the history of psychology as well as a modern analysis of how focusing one's energy can help us to accomplish everything we want. It's much more clinical & detailed then most 'self-help' genre of books."
4,Bears Re-discovery,"With the recent scientific investigations into the psycho-physiological roots of religious experience, this ten-year-old book bears re-discovery. While not overtly spiritual in nature, this book could perhaps become the basis for a new spirituality -- one where personal happiness is the highest goal, and optimal experience is the means by which it is achieved. Anyone who is interested in spirituality (even non-supernaturalist spirituality) and psychology will find this author's work worth investigating."
3,Worthy Read,"""Flow"" is a book about improving both performance and satisfaction in most pursuits.If awareness is required for improvement, than the analysis presented in ""Flow"" is helpful in both regards.The book provides a general description of the pleasant sensation described as ""Flow.""Based on people's descriptions of positive experiences, the author identifies the shared characteristics of the experiences that correspond to the respective experiences being characterized as positive.Searching for ""Flow (psychology)"" on Wikipedia will yield a pretty good understanding of the concepts presented in ""Flow.""However, it is interesting to read how Csíkszentmihályi comes to conceptualize ""Flow."""
3,Unfortunately unoriginal,"Flow is an exciting concept, and a truly dynamic experience - but that doesn't mean this is a great book. The author has basically taken the concept articulated by earlier psychologists such as Maslow and Freud and tried to put a modern, quantitative spin on it. Anyway, isn't losing yourself in a creative activity common sense? We don't need high-falutin' academics and their ""studies"" to prove what we already know.Furthermore, the entire concept is now so much a part of the public consciousness that it has been bastardized, marginalized and trivialized. I doubt one in a hundred readers of this book will regularly find flow experiences - whereas are our hardworking, less introspective and more realistic forebears would easily find flow without having read this pseudo-masterpiece."
4,Worthwhile,"Not an easy read, it may require a committment to finish, but well worth the effort.If you have wondered why playing a mediocre game of golf is more personally rewarding than watching mutli-millionaires slap bellies on TV (football), Mihaly has the answer."
5,Good.,"Flow - a state that people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter.The entire book is about how to achieve that state in everything from exercising to using it to achieve successful relationships, and to making life a complete flow experience. Flow can also be seen as another way to achieve happiness.The book really changed some of my thoughts and that's why I think so highly of it. It's a well written book with many good notions. It is also some what motivational though it is not intended to be."
4,Very good self-help book,"I've read a lot of self-help books already and most of them focus too much on getting rich and being succesfull but don't tell you how you will get happy because of them. This book is nothing of that, it wont teach you how to become a success. But it will teach you how become happy.You don't want to be succesfull because you want to be better than others, it is doing challenges because you learn from it personally, your self grows, not your arrogance. Hence flow is compared a lot to eastern philosophy.This wont feel as 'shiny' as the other books. You wont get huge adrenaline shots while reading it. So I think it is normal that this book doesn't get as much attention as the others. But it will change you silently from within."
3,It's a good book for a grad student,I didn't get a lot out of this book. I think it's more for someone in college who could get more out of it for their education.
3,You found it!,"If you are searching for a method to improve your life experience, this book is one of the best first steps to take. It offers nothing less than a proven and documented way to fully immerse yourself in your chosen activity. Use of the princpals outlined in this classic book will make work more rewarding, art more passionate and interpersonal relationships more fulfilling. The author's name is the most challenging part of reading this book. His style is easy to read, but not condescending. I've read lots and lots of books and this one is unequalled. Csikszentmihalyi is not only a genius, but the more rare type of genius who can share what he knows, and what he knows can make a day and night difference in a person's life regardless of what that person's occupation is. Flow will turbocharge your life!"
2,Good but..........,"The subject held me until the constant and unnatural use of the female pronoun and female illustrative examples just became so irritating that I could simply no longer entertain this book. I suspect this protocol was dictated post writing by a member/s of the feminist PC brigade This appears to be a particular problem with American publications, but is also creeping into the UK. Shame, spoilt what otherwise may have been a great read."
4,Sound research and interesting reading,"I found the book to be fascinating. It is well researched and very pragmatic. He stops short of explaining how to go about putting more ""flow"" into your life and he is unapologetic about this not being a ""how to"" book. After reading ""Flow"" I read Authentic Happiness by Martin Seligman and that does try harder to tell you how to do it."
5,Excellent explorations,Excellent consciousness investigations given in this book. After reading I find myself more aware about my thoughts and it's causality.I've enjoyed this book a lot.
5,"It is a classic, must read","You should know that the book is long! It has small font size and lots of pages, it is a fairly sophisticated book, however it's not difficult to understand, it just tells you a LOT about people and how we behave. I think it's a must read if you're interested in the topic."
5,An outstanding analysis of the creative experience.,"Professor Csikszentmihalyi takes a difficult concept and makes it accessible. The ramifications of his work are virtually limitless. We have the power to choose the realities in which we live, and this book offers invaluable insights into creating the optimal reality for each of us. But more than being ""inspirational"", his work is scientific and critical. A ""must read"" for the intellectual interested in psychological growth and understanding."
3,An inspiring book not only in Transforming Work...,"Flow and flow dynamics, dissipative self-organization in complexe systems have attracted me more than 10 years ago. As a Consultant for transforming work and leadership I worked with various insights - also Mihaly's - successfully, but found that there is a ""higher non-evolutive"" C3-order (Creator, Creation, Creature) that cannot be modelled by simplified darwinian chaos theories. This step however was only possibly by considering what Mihaly is writing about. Thanks to that I joined my partner, Dr. Peter Meier, to further develop his APS Applied Personal Science to model real human systems from their (predictible) outcome!"
3,Willie Loman takes up zen philosophy,"I enjoyed the first few chapters of this book but became increasingly frustrated with the shallowness of the author's research and thought. He cites many studies by his followers which are bound to prove his point. More seriously, he seems completely unfamiliar with both serious questions about the meaning of life and the serious exploitative meaninglessness of many jobs and pastimes offered to us by late twentieth-century capitalism. Sure, you can find flow while entering data or pushing papers, but is this really how you want to spend your life? Wouldn't you rather be a professor at the University of Chicago, surrounded by disciples whose research validates your own ideas--like Csikszentmihalyi?"
3,No flow in readability,"I was very excited to get my hands on this book after reading about it in Authentic Happiness. Years later I bought a copy of it in a Library sale. My expectations were higher than the book could fulfill. The readability was off and on. Unlike How we Decide, FLOW was at times a bore and I'm someone who really enjoys these sorts of books. It couldn't hold my interest even though I really wanted to get into it. The technique it has to impart is very useful. I just wish the book captured and utilized the idea to bring about flow in reading because it became a struggle to stay with."
2,Falls Flat,"The main issue I have with this book is that it is a fairly boring read. The second is that it is filled with vague generalities that don't fit into any recognizable scientific or psychological norms. It is essentially one man's take on what it means to be happy. As a definition of happiness, it sort of works, but there isn't really any substance to the book. Filled with oblique metaphor, anecdotal evidence, and a loosely defined spiritualism that is most similar to Zen Buddhism, the book does nothing to provide any answers on how one can truly be happy. The pursuit of 'flow,' admirable as it may be, is in no way definable as making one happy any more than any other esoteric personal philosophy. If you're interested in the nature of happiness or in invigorating your own creative spirit, there are much better resources available.2/5 Stars. Turbid, unscientific, and lacking any philosophical base aside from its own claims. Give Aristotle a read instead."
5,Technology Won't Save Us,"It's really nice knowing that there is something else out there after Godmachine; Just got this in the mail today and I listened to it and, enjoyed it right off the bat!"
4,Great Background to the Legends,"This book is REALLY hard to find, but if you're really interested in the origins of Vampiric legends and folklore (not a ""fan"" who belongs to a Vampire Club), this is a good introduction. It is very oddly organized, almost like a 2nd party collected the author's notes and then arranged them, mostly by guesswork, but the information is solid. Read this first then get VAMPIRE FORENSICS, for a much better organized and thorough background."
3,Good flow and rhythm,"But watch your skin, it hurts if the rope hits you as it is some plastic/vinly material that is pliable but strong."
4,"Yes, another problem on the adjustment.","Yes, it's a decent speed rope for the money and yes, it's extremely frustrating to adjust. For me, the problem wasn't so much in getting the metal cap off (easily done with a simple, sturdy flathead screwdriver pinned in the center of the tab) nor was it in actually adjusting the length of the rope. The problem was in getting the tab back in the handle. The cylindrical metal tab has to be snug in the handle lest it fly off during your excercise, but OH MYYY!!!, getting it back in requires an incredible and equal amount of pressure on all sides at the same time. I spent almost an hour before I finally got lucky and was able to push it back in. Good luck!!As for the review concerning knots, I can see how they might prove to be cumbersome with the hindering of the motion of the rope. However, I'm not sure why anyone would want to tie knots in the first place. Just cut away the excess rope.Now that my frustration is gone and my rope is fixed, it does a great job."
3,adjusting problem,"As other reviews note, adjusting is an issue. It isn't so much the ease of adjustment, but when you shorten the rope, you tie a knot in the rope and put it back in the handle. Problem is, knot is too big for the handle and negates the functionality of the bearings. So I'm going to have to remove the metal end that is crimped on the end of the rope and re-crimp it at the desired length. Kind of a pain."
5,"Good rope, great price","I jump an hour a day indoors, so I tend to go through ropes very quickly. I've had speed ropes snap, beaded ropes come undone at the handle, and even leather ropes wear out and break. The shelf life for a rope for me is only a few weeks, and it is very frustrating.Skeptically, I bought 4 Valeo ropes for around $5 apiece hoping they would last a while. Amazingly, it's been a month, I'm still on my first one, and I see no wear and tear on it. At the 2 week mark, the rivet popped off, but it was due to me not fastening it tightly enough when I first adjusted the length. It took 5 minutes to fix.Aside from its durability, I find it rather easy to adjust the height as well. All it requires is a flathead screwdriver to pop off the cap, a razor to trim the rope to desired length, and some pliers to secure the rivet.Overall, the best rope I've bought in awhile. Since they were so cheap, I also have 3 more waiting in the wings..."
5,Bouncin',"I got this rope so I could use it for exercise, as well as to play with my kids outside. It's perfect. Although hurts like heck when you hit your ankle with it. LOL But it's excellent and I highly recommend it. The only drawback to this rope is it holds its shape from shipping..."
2,Durable solid rubber rope.....NOT!!!,"This jump is perfect in every sense, the length is perfect, the grip is great and easily adjustable but it has one BIG drawback the so called ""Durable solid rubber rope"" isn't as durable as mentioned it keeps breaking. You will notice how fast the 10"" rope comes down to 5""."
3,"Unless you are 6'3"" you dont want this rope",I am 6 feet tall. I read the reviews before buying this too! But I was not clear and thinking that I am tall enough for this. But I was wrong. There is no adjustment available. I bought a pair of them thinking that my wife can have her own. For her this rope is very long and not adjustable. She is trying to wrap excess rope around her hands. However that is not helping her in any way from what I observed while she is skipping.I recommend try to look for one it offers adjustable rope. I didn't try opening the handles to see if I can cut the rope a bit at the edge. Once I try opening the handle I will post my findings back.It is priced well and good quality item. If the manufacturer can provide the rope adjustment this is a the best in this price range.
3,too heavy for a speed jump rope,"It feels like a really durable and sturdy jump rope, but its hard to adjust it. It is pretty heavy for a ""speed"" jump rope.. the rope it self is like half a inch diameter thick, and the foam grip handles are too huge for a speed jump rope.(I didn't realized that till it came) I thought I bought a speed jump rope, instead I got a heavy jump rope.The length itself is perfect, for me.Im 6.3 and its a perfect size jump rope but its too heavy compared to my other jump ropes. (which are too small in length that is why I bought this)"
5,Best Rope and easy to adjust,"This is the best rope for money and very easy to adjust. I read through some of the reviews where many complained about the complexity of adjustment and use of pliers etc. It doesn't need all that. I was just able to pop out the black cap at the back and pull out the wire, adjust the length and just fold & put the wire back along with closing the back cap. It was all done in 1 or 2 minutes together on both handles. It is very very easy and the best rope for the money we pay."
4,nice speed rope,"This is a good speed rope that has really helped me to get back in shape. Love that this thing is portable and I can take it anywhere I need to go. Have been working out on the roof, which have been a great experience. How many pieces of home gym equipment can you do that with?"
2,Check your height...,"Great price, but too long. For a 5'3"" person, its too long, and the adjustment is not feasible. Also, the rope itself HURTS when hit by the extreme length."
2,too short,I'm about 6'1 and it always hits me in the back of the head i got pissed off and ripped it in half after about a week of use probably fine if you're shorter just thought I'd give a heads up
4,It is good.,This jump rope is perfect only except it is not easy to adjust the length of the rope. Cuz I am not tall but the rope is kind of long to me. It took me some time to change the length.
3,Good rope at best,"I have been jumping rope for 2 years. I am not an expert, but in my humble opinion I like the speed ropes(the Master is best/the Aero is good too!) from Buddy Lee the best. This is not to say I disliked this rope, but I feel the Harbinger and Buddy Lee ropes performed a bit better. This rope felt a ""bit light"" at the handles. The handles are comfortable-I removed the sponge grips which I felt gave me a better feel of the rope."
1,Terrible Product!!!!,"If I wanted a pice of cable wire, I could have easily cut a piece from the plethora that I see hanging on my nearby light-pole."
3,great product with comfortable handles,"very comfortable handles! i am very pleased with the comfort level of this. it is well made and by the looks of it, i will have it for a very long time. happy customer."
2,Wore Out Quick,After only a couple of months of light use the bearings in one of the handles is shot. Using the jump rope quickly winds the rope up.
1,Eating right through...,"I purchased this rope a couple of months ago and just noticed how bad of a beating it has taken. The spot where the rope meets the ground has been worn half through. Now I don't jump that often, (in fact during these couple of months, I had to take a two-week break due to injury) so the product has not been through a lot of wear and tear to be in this poor shape. The only thing I can think of is the three times I jumped on my patio, which has a rougher surface texture than my usual spot in the garage. Still, it looks like it's been through a fight with a belt sander. I'll look elsewhere for a new rope. (And soon, apparently.)"
1,Awful,Rope was hard to adjust. had to get a screwdriver to remove cap. Then adjusted rope to my height and started. Rope got all twisted up and ball-bearing did not spin at all. Threw it away. Only good thing was that it was really inexpensive.
2,Snapped!,I enjoyed it for two weeks. I jumped every day and I was loving it. Then it snapped at the handle. So sad.
1,Awesome! Better than running!! EDIT! ONE STAR,"EDIT*** AFTER TWO MONTHS THIS THING SNAPPED IN HALF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND ALMOST TOOK MY DAMN EYE OUT! DO NOT BUY!!I never would have thought that jump roping would be more of a work out than running but it really is! I have been jumping for a little over two weeks and my pants already fit more loosely! This is a really great quality jump rope! Very durable and will last a long time! It is also very easy to adjust, all I needed was a pair of needle nose pliers and the rest is pretty simple to do yourself.THIS IS A MUST BUY!Miscellaneous: As I mentioned before I have lost weight after a short period of time. I was in a bulking phase where I wanted to get big but I have realized that I really enjoyed being more toned and slim, and at 230 pounds and only 5'10 (mostly muscle, im not fat and I bench 350 lbs) but I dont care about being strong anymore, being big has made a lot more sluggish and not as fast as I once was. So now I am slimming back down."
3,Decent jump rope if you use it right.,"Pretty good jump rope, would recommend people to buy it.PROS/Likes:-Generally good build quality, just needed something to jump rope with to do some boxing training.CONS/Dislikes:-You have to cut the cord in the handles in order to adjust the jump rope. Tying a knot or others will cause the jump rope to twist and you will not be able to jump rope effectively.Other Thoughts:Meh, its ok for the price"
5,It works!,"This jump rope was very easy to adjust!Here are some tips:1) To remove cap at bottom: Use a screw driver to remove cap.2) To adjust rope to appropriate length: There are two metal crimp pieces (one already fastened and the other one loosened) within each tube. Tip: you may have to shake in order to see both crimp pieces.3)Use pliers to cut off the desired length of rope and then use pliers to fasten the loosened metal crimp piece by squeezing the crimp piece together with pliers.4) Jump, jump, jump!"
4,not bad,"i wish the rope was a little bit heavier, and it's kinda hard to adjust the length. but hey, can't expect much from the product for $7, so let's just say it's fine."
1,Adjusting isn't your biggest problem,It just curls up and knots up no matter how you store it. It's a bad product.Bought it and simply can't use it.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"The rope comes pretty long. There are instructions on how to shorten the rope. You open the handles to expose the crimped end of the rope, with one extra crimp to use after you cut to your desired length. You get one shot. I cut it, put the crimp in place and squeezed it, which broke the crimp and sent it flying. The rope was ruined before I spun it even one time.Spend a couple more bucks and get a decent rope."
2,Not durable at all.,"I purchased this item in August, 2011. Since then, I've been using it for only dozen times. Couple days ago, it broke in the middle part where it hits the cement ground. I suspect it's because of the winter temperature. But I've been keeping it in my garage where it shouldn't be too cold. Not recommended!"
5,"wow, pleasantly surprised","i love it! it has a smooth motion that i really didn't expect and the handles are really something else. i fully expected it to feel cheaply made and crappy but i was pleasantly surprised. a lot of the other reviewers complained about the fact that it was hard to cut this down to the length they wanted but that's 100% untrue. it literally took me all of 30 seconds to pop the tops, cut it done to length and tie the ends (so i can go back any time and fix length if needed). i would HIGHLY recommend this product!"
1,You get what you pay for,"I hate this jump rope. I didn't have too much trouble adjusting it, just popped off the plastic cap at the end, pulled it in to the length I wanted and then crimped the additional metal crimp provided. However...As soon as I started jumping it started to twist and after about 25 jumps it was tangling around my feet and I had to stop and let it hang to unwind, then let it hang from the other side to unwind more. Not only is this annoying in general, but it is even more annoying when you are doing interval training and trying to beat the clock. After the 2nd interval of skipping I simply threw it on the ground and pretended I was skipping rope.Stupid, stupid jump rope. I am throwing it out. It was cheap, but you get what you pay for."
1,Broke in the first two days.,Not sure if others experienced the same thing. This jump rope broke at the handle after only two days of use.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I purchased two of these and they have BOTH snapped under normal wear and tear. You get what you pay for with this product.
3,Eh. Not really sure I care for this,"Add another to list of issues with adjustment. I managed to adjust it by taking the end caps off the handles, pulling it through and having to tie a knot in it, putting it back in the handle. Problem: with the knot in the handle, it doesn't really turn freely like it should. Thus, it tends to twist up after just a few jumps.I'm not sure I'm going to keep using this since I have some arthritis in my knees and found it really, really painful. That is in no way the manufacturer's fault, just a word of warning to others that if you have or ever had bad knee problems, this just might be the worst thing you could do to them.All in all, it could definitely be easier to adjust, but works for the price."
3,Great jump rope if you can adjust it.,"This rope is great for the price, but when it came to adjusting it was a bit discouraging. First of all, the instructions on adjusting the length rope wasn't clear. There was nothing to be unscrewed as it stated. Instead you have to pop off the caps at the end of the handles. I had to do this with a flat head screwdriver. After that, trying to get the metal crimp to move after loosening it with some pliers was also a pain. I got like sore fingers after that. But after all that effort, it turns into a great jump rope. Would have rated it higher if it was more simple to adjust, but other then that it's a good jump rope."
2,tried and failed -- getting a different one..,"I adjusted the length fairly easily, that's not a problem. The 2 problems are:1) the plastic rope itself never straightened out from being in the package -- always had kinks in it.2) the ball bearings didn't work smoothly and after a minute of jumping, I had to stop and untangle. that sucked..."
1,jump rope quality,"This jump rope is made of some type plastic and not actual rope. Due to the cold weather, I have yet to get it to straighten out enough to even try to use it. You could call that a nice way of saying most likely more junk from China. Since packaging was thrown away upon opening, can't verify that, but if not then still junk."
1,Jump rope twists onto itself-waste of money,"This jump rope keeps twisting while you try to jump and is dangerous! I almost tripped over it several times. I even tried to place weights on the rope overnight to stretch it out and untwist it, but that did not help at all. Also, it is almost impossible to adjust for your height."
2,TOO HARD TO ADJUST!!,I would give this rope five stars if it wasn't so hard to adjust the length! It was way too time consuming and I eventually settled for tying a couple knots. If you're not 6'1'' I recommend finding one that's easier to adjust the length of!
2,Flawed design makes impossible to adjust,"The rope appears to be sturdy and quality-made. However, it's impossible to adjust the length. First of all, the directions say to unscrew the rope handle from the black plastic cap. The cap does not screw off; it pops off. I wouldn't complain about the incorrect directions as it is easy enough to figure out, but the rope cannot be pushed down through the handle to the opening. At one point in the handle, the tunnel through which the rope must pass becomes too narrow to fit the rope and metal crimp. There is no way to reach the end of the rope to shorten the length. If able to adjust the length, I would give this rope 5 stars."
3,Good but only if you trim the rope first,"It's a good jump rope but has some flaws. There are no instructions for how to adjust the length. What you need to do is pop the handle that opens, pull and then cut the excess rope once you figure out the ideal length. If you don't, I don't see how it's possible to squeeze the rest back into the handle that pops open. You'll also need to loosen the metal ring that holds the rope in place inside the handle and tighten it in it's new location. Once this happens you won't be able to readjust the length again (unless you want to make it shorter). It'll be difficult for people of different heights to share it. Also the rope is kind of hard so it hurts if you accidentally whack yourself with it. It also gets in to knots on occasion. Mine wore out in about a year. Aside from that it works okay."
2,it gets twisted. a simple cotton one would be better,it looks good but it twists a lot.. so one needs to stop to untangle it. it does adjust for height but not in an easy / pretty way.
5,ok,"articulo requerido, en buen estado y me encuentro satisfecho con el mismo, ya estoy con el producto en mis manos, y el retrazo en tenerlo es debido a las festividades"
3,It's ok,The rope tends to curl making it a lot harder to jump. I'm the middle of a jump the rope curves in throwing you way off...
3,OK,"The only problem is that, it is difficult to adjust the length. In addiction, there is only one chance to adjust it."
3,expected for the price,"The jump rope isn't bad but it does stay twisted no matter what i do to try to straighten it. but for the price, it is quite good."
4,easy to use,this is very light and easy to use. the length can be adjusted easily but then no one else can use it if you're short. I'm 6'2 an i didn't have to clip of much of it to be comfortable...great exercise tool
3,Good for the price - but just spend extra to get something better.,"I purchased this jump rope several weeks ago and just started using it, since it took me this long to adjust the rope. The metal crimp inside the handle took me 45 minutes to open and allow rope adjustment. You cannot just tie a knot in the rope and call it a day. The rope will not spin properly. Once I finally made the necessary changes, the rope seem to perform fine. What do you expect for a cheap price? Good for what you paid for it."
5,ideal,"This is a pretty great jump rope. I mean, what do you expect from a jump rope? It serves its purpose extremely well and the price was appealing. Fast shipping, great product - couldn't be happier."
3,Quality changed,"My sister bought this rope about 2 month ago and the rubber rope was soft and nice. However, the new rope i ordered about 2 weeks later was too hard and stiff. You have to swing harder to get it right, comparing to my sister's softer one. Other than that, it is good for the price. & I love Amazon Prime."
3,Get what you pay for...,"I received this jump rope as a gift from my gym. Ultimately, it's a very inexpensive (or free) jump rope and it'd probably be functional for most people, but there are some major drawbacks. I'm 6'4"", and the rope doubles as a hairtrimmer, so if you're any taller than me, forget it. Also, as many others have noted, resizing looks like a pain; knots and plastic aren't meant to be. I gave it to my girlfriend, and after about 5 months of frequent use (3-4 times a week for 20 minutes), the grips started disintegrating. All in all, if you're 5' something and have strong, small fingers, this is the jumprope for the casual fitness enthusiast. If you're tall, or serious about jumping rope, try something else."
4,Good rope for the money. I added how I trimmed it down.,"I'm a little confused why so many people have had problems with sizing the rope. Rule of thumb for length - step on the middle of the rope (w/ your regular workout shoes on) and each end should measure up to your pits (or pecks). For resizing, I used a pocket knife, a pair of scissors, a pair of pliers, and a sharpie. I pried off the little caps on the end of the handles with the pocket knife and cut off the rope right before the used metal crimps (there are two unused crimps attached inside as well). I then measured the rope for my height and marked it right where it went into the handles with the sharpie. I then placed and crimped (with the pliers) the new metal pieces right above the marked rope for inside the handles. Finally, I trimmed the excess rope and then popped the caps back on. Hope this helps."
4,Quite good,"functional, easily adjustable, although a bit heavy, so if you accidentally slap yourself with it while exercising, make sure none of the people that think you don't swear is around ;)"
1,Just a bad product,"Bottomline, it was really stiff and never loosened up/untangeled well. Also it broke from the handle easily as well. I would definitely look to another vendor for a jump rope product."
4,Very sturdy rope.,It's a good jump rope. I'd recommend it. It was shipped quickly and the product is exactly as described. Good value as well.
3,good jump rope,the item is a great rope to jump with.crafted very well.the item doesn't show any signs of breaking.
2,"cheap plastic ""handles"".","This is literally just a thin rubber cord inside of two incredibly cheap plastic ""handles"". The string is supposed to be held in place by a small plastic ring that the cord is slid through, thus preventing the cord from exiting the end of the handle."
2,You Get What You Pay For,Used it everyday until the rope broke right at the handle. I adjusted it and then the other side broke. Worked for about three weeks.I suggest finding one that has a better rope not made out of rubber.
2,Bad Quality?,"I bought it at its original price and started using it recently. I used this rope for about two month, about 1000 jumps every day 6 days a week. It gave out today. Yesterday the middle of the rope had been broken in two. I taped it with duct tape. Today the rope at the handle swivel snapped. It's become irreparable. It's more rubber than rope. It wore away faster than I'd like. For $11 breaking after using for two months seems unacceptable."
1,Supprised,"I was supprised this item is made of a vynal rope or plastic of some kind and is stiff and not very flexible, kind of odd, not what I expected. For the money why not a high quality rope?"
2,Rope was too long,"I had to return this product because the rope was too long, I could not find out a way to adjust the rope at all. No directing comes with this product so I had to return the item."
1,Worse Jump Rope I Ever Used,"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I bought it on August and it was ripped off on September the same year. Please do not buy this product. It will only cost you money. Bad combination of rope and grips. I spent almost $10 w/ shipping and handling for nothing. And the instruction manual says that you should try it for at least 12 minutes everyday while I was trying only 3-4 minutes. If I used for 12 minutes, I'm afraid it would be ripped of faster than that. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
3,Whipped the skin off my leg,"The rope is cool, but the only problem I have is that when you're jumping, you have to be careful of your body or wear long spandex. I was jumping and it whipped across my knee and tore skin. It will definitely leave a mark. Now I'm nervous. And please don't leave it around kids, because they will definitely hurt themselves or someone else with this rope. I would recommend one of those old fashioned straw, cloth like ropes."
2,muy buena para saltar,"He tenido otras cuerdas para saltar y este es la mejor por el peso y la flexibilidad , las mainllas son muy comodas la recomiendo"
2,Be careful ordering from this provider,"Luckily I only ordered a jump rope, which I will donate to the school for the heart assoc. jump. The product was a birthday present for a child and obviously opened. The rope was way too long and difficult to adjust.

1,I can't adjust the rope.....,I went to the website [...] and saw the instruction i took off the black cap with ease but there is 2 mental clamps are seem impossible to get out of the handle and can fit through the handle hole either so impossible to adjust from this point....
2,Poor design,"What people say about adjusting the length is true. I had pliers, wrenches, and the works and still adjusting the length was a major problem. Also, the rope had been so tightly wound (and too quickly packaged) that it seriously still has a crooked shape when extended. Very poor manufactoring/packaging. The bearings are nice though, and the rope otherwise works. I recommend it only for people who at 6'5"" and don't have to adjust the length."
1,"Like others, couldn't adjust the rope","Here is what the instructions say:Step 1) Unscrew rope handle from black plastic cap. Set handles aside.Step 2) Push rope down through end of cap so both metal crimp pieces are visible...And despite being a reasonably smart and handy guy, I could not pass step 2.Under the foam grip, the handle is sort of hourglass shaped. The design/production problem is that the crimp and rope are on the side of the hourglass closest to the handle, already crimped. The right side of the hourglass has a cap at the end, which is removable. However, it simply was not possible to get the rope and crimp through the narrow gap near the center of the handle so that it could be taken out through the uncapped hole and shortened. Gotta love Chinese manufacturing. Cheap cost. Cheap design."
1,the worst thing i ever purchased,"this rope is very long ,you can not adjust it even if they say adjustable , I think they should remove this word adjustable for unadjustable , Also it comes to me not well packed , bottom line this is the worst i ever purchased."
4,Worth the Money,"Not the best rope I have ever used but well worth the price for a beginner. Hard to adjust to your proper length and requires tools. (Pliers, screw driver) and can't be adjusted easily for different users. Nice weight for jumping."
5,Great,"I have nothing to complain about this product, I work out with it and it does perfectly what it says. Plus, it doesn't hurt even when you accidentally slap yourself with the rope, so I guess the speed is right, and i would recommend it to anyone who is interested in loosing some weight by jumping ropes."
1,DO NOT BUY IT!,I bought on Monday then It's broken on Wendsday...It can not last even one week.....TRUST ME! DO NOT BUY IT!!!
3,"Allright, but breaks easily","Very light wieght and easily adjustable. I've owned 3, but basically the price is right - The first lasted about 4 months, the next 2 lasted about a month each. I did put them into heavy use - jumping 30 minutes a day about 4 days a week. The failure happens at the junction of the handle and the cord - it just snaps mid jump. If you opt to buy, go ahead and get 2"
2,Yuck,I don't know why all the jump ropes seem to be made out of this plastic material but it remains coiled up and is very hard to use as a result.
1,CA Proposition 65 Warning,"The following warning is on a label on the back of the package this jump rope came in:California Proposition 65 Warning:This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and/or other reproductive harm.Needless to say, I am returning the item and will not use it. I thought jump ropes were supposed to help prevent diseases like cancer..."
1,Valeo Jump Rope Speed,"MAy be this rope is for professional, I don't know. I hurts so bad when it hits you. I don't think that Imma ever use it again. And it is sooo long."
3,Not A Speed Rope,"I did a video review onHarbinger Speed Jump Rope PVC 9 Ft Adjustable (Black)in which I also gave it a 3. As speed ropes, both should really be rated 1. All the details are in the other review. (Update) Interesting, an actual demonstration of the ropes in question and a comparison with a lighter rope, and that was unhelpful to 3 people. Makes you wonder who they might work for. Only one unhelpful on the almost identical rope this review links to, wonder why. Maybe that's another reason to avoid this rope - trolls with an agenda. May 21, 2008 - Now 0 out of 4 found it non-helpful. Wonder why they don't leave a comment explaining why."
3,Valeo Speed Jump Rope Review,"Easy to adjust length. After about a month's use, it still kinks and curls up, even after soaking it in water and stretching it out a bit. Jumps fine, but can get tangled up when you stop. I'm a beginnner at jump roping and I'm satisfied with this rope for now."
2,hard to fit to your height,the speed jumprope does not make it easy to change to your height. The bolt is already smashed down on the rope and you cannot remove it to reduce the length of the rope. I just do 25 jumpropes and then uncoil the rope. Would not recomment this type.
1,This thing Should Be used to Beat people,This is not No Fkin Jump rope this is more like a BELT ! this thing is so Thick that when i will Jump rope with it & it will hit the floor it sound like the floor is about to brake & when it will hit me sometimes it felt like i was a black slave !
4,great for the money,This is a good rope for the money and has a little weight to it. I also use a leather rope which is lighter so I switch them up. There are a few comments about adjusting the length and they are right - it's a pain the butt if you try to re-clamp with the existing metal. What I found worked much better is to burn the end. Take a lighter and burn the rubber and with a flat object shape it a bit so there's a nub at the end - this works great. If you try clamping it with anything bigger it will get jammed and bearings will not spin.
5,Effective fitness tool,"This jump rope is a perfect fitness tool. The bearings in the handles make it really easy for anyone, even novices. I am 6'2"" and did not have to adjust the length at all. I wonder if this would be long enough for someone much taller than me, but for people my size it works fine without any adjustment. This is a great way to warm up or do some conditioning. Cheap, simple, effective. What more could you ask."
4,Jumping rope for the first time since elementary school,"So I'm 6'7"". This rope is probably 6"" too short for me but it works. I have been jumping on a concrete pad and it is starting to wear a little now (3 months). I am guessing it will get 9-12 months out of it before it breaks, which seems very good to me. Good speed for someone like me just looking for an alternate form of cardio."
1,BUSTED!!,"I used this rope frequently. It performed great while it lasted but on one workout session, the thing busted through the center. This rope did not match my quality expectations and left me in the want for another jump rope. Do not buy this product."
2,Too hard to adjust,I bought this for my son in college. He is mechanically inclined but could not get one of the end caps off. I decided to get a couple of other brands and he is much happier with those.
5,Great workout rope,I love this jumprope. I use it outside so I break them periodically but also have a spare on hand. I do tie knots in the handles to get it the right length but it is absolutely perfect for my outside workouts!
1,poor quality-broken after a few times use,after saw all the good reviews I decided to buy this jump rope...but it just broke apart this morning after just a few times use.Don't waste your money on it.
5,A Rave for Max Raabe & Palast Orchester,"I've watched this dvd over & over. If you love the popular music of the 1920's, '30's & 40's - this is a real upper. Max Raabe and his orchestra have recreated the authentic sound and look of the era. I have some old recordings of German tangos of the period and many recordings of American music of the period and the arrangements are faithfully reproduced with all the gusto, excitement and life of the originals. This is great music and a wonderfully entertaining dvd, the kind that makes you feel happy - what a gift!"
5,Like Being at the Concert Without Leaving Home,"My mother attended a concert by Max Raabe and Palast Orchester in Chicago and purchased the DVD. When I watched it, I had to have my own copy and purchased it for less At Amazon than what she paid for it at the concert. The vendor(Movie Mars) had really fast delivery(3 days). I love that this music is sung in many languages(German, English, Italian) but that you can have subtitles in English to understand the lyrics and the jokes they make. I was dancing through the whole performance, and have watched it several times since. It really puts me in a good mood. The music from the '20's and '30's with big band feel, and many tangos feels timeless. If you like ""Dancing with the Stars,"" you will enjoy watching this DVD and will dance along while they perform."
5,This is a fine group of musicians.,I have played this DVD many times and thoroughly enjoy it each time. These people are exceedingly professional and so obviously enjoy their work and themselves that you can't help but relate.
5,Jauria,"I have spent hours trying to find the Spanish edition of Bitten and was thrilled when I happened upon a blog finally revealing the title was ""Jauria"" meaning 'hounds' not ""Mordido"" which means 'bitten'. Helps to have the right title when searching. I can't wait to get my copy :)"
5,Second most stirring book I have read.,"I asked a respected leader in America, ""What do you recommend I do, so my life would be spent having the greatest impact for helping people?"" He told me to read the two volume book on Hudson Taylor by Dr. & Mrs. Howard Taylor. He was right. Wow, what a book--what a life!This book has given me A LOT to think about and apply. I highly recommend this book to anybody who has a heart to serve people. Don't hesitate to read such a long book, it probably is better than the last five you read put together!"
5,A Great Value!,"I was unsure about purchasing Word Perfect 12 Home Edition as I have always used Microsoft Office at work. I decided to give it a try as a colleague of mine has it and is very happy with it. Boy, am I happy I made the jump to Word Perfect Office. It has all the features of Microsoft Office but with a more affordable price tag. Today I use it a lot for home and business uses. I can even edit documents from work that I created with Microsoft Excel. If you have Excel documents, you can still open, edit and save them using Word Perfect Office. I highly recommend Word Perfect."
3,Typing self taught with pictures,"Nicely laid out, well thought out book BUT the web site url given promising the code for download is aliased to Amazon.After much looping and checking phptr.com site I can only conclude the source code is not available.Good luck with you debugging."
3,Brutal yet boring,"While this is brutal and furious death/black metal, I find this album to be quite dull. Nothing really interesting in there. If you like stuff like Suffocation and Nile like I do, you will be pleased with this album, but not enough to keep it too long in your CD player. Anyway, I've ordered Satanica from Behemoth a few days ago, to see wheither this is an accident or not..."
1,what the hell is this??????????,"there is no structure or actual talent present at all in this cd! all it is is just more scream scream scream nu metal. if you like real music check out the strokes, puddle of mudd, and smile empty soul. those bands have talent! this is utter crap!"
5,Magnificent,"Very warm, thoughtful and enjoyable. A gem. Has a ""sad"" longing sound, the players must really want to be in Havana -without Castro- to have inadvertely influx that sadness in their adaptation's dna."
1,Save your money,"Sorry, folks. This CD is bad. Maybe horrible. The arrangements do not sound very Beatles-like. The music is so-so. And the group lacks a talented singer. The vocals detract from the songs. I buy a lot of CDs and this is the worst selection of the last 2 years. Suggest you save your money for something of better quality."
4,Who would have thought?,"I'm know as having some very eclectic tastes in music but this one topped the cake. I wondered how they would pull it off. Once I put the disc in I couldn't believe it! The sound just blew me away! A very tight Cuban orchestra with some wonderful arrangements in variations of El Son. ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" is absolutely stellar. A must for anyone who would like to listen to the familiar Beatles tunes while on a tropical beach."
2,Well laid out but not that great,"While this book has lots of great pictures, the recipes aren't all that great. I've made about 10 different cookies in the book and have found that many of them are not as easy as they sound. Many of the doughs require ""rolling out"" or ""balling"" and the doughs are just too sticky to do so. I found some of the recipes really frustrating. Plan to spend A LOT of time trying to figure out NEW ways to make the cookies work. =)"
5,teacher's view,"I was touched by the pure simplicity of the book. The photographs show us everyday life from a 'you are there' stand point without all of the verbiage of a reporter or professional writer. I have several students who have enlisted with different branches of the military and this book is opportunity for them to see the mundane side of war as well as the brotherhood that war creates. Each snapshot is a story in itself. We have gone from the first TV war, Vietnam, to the first digital war, Iraq. Americans will get a mixed bag of life as they go through each of these photos."
2,Hard to keep it together,"It was hard to keep the conecting tubes to stay on to each of the ant farms. The sand was hard to pour in and made a mess and there weren't enought of it in the first place. Also, the ants died quickly and my son, 6 at the time, lost interest in a few days."
1,Sadly dissapointed,"We purchased this gift for our five year old because he has loved catching catrpillars and feeding and setting free the moth that would amerge. Little did we know were setting him up to learn about death in such a vivid fashion. It was just so cruel to find out that these ant would not be living and breeding, just tolling without purpose and dieing.I would not recomend this item for anyone of any age."
1,try another brand,I bought this for my daughters birthday and to our dismay there was no ant certificate to send in for our ants. I have tried and tried to contact Uncle Miltons and the line is constantly busy. I am going to return this and purchase another brand.
1,ants? farm,"rec ant farm in Nov, still waiting for the ants, they where ordered from the form on the kit, and still have not rec them....so have not been able to use....don't order waste of money."
2,Could have been better built,"Adequate for larger (5mm to 10mm) ants, but definitely inadequate for smaller ants. There are just too many holes and gaps for the ants to escape (and not just the air holes on top), though admittedly the instructions said the container wasn't made for small ants. Disassembling the village to get to the accessories was somewhat difficult and resulted in some damage to the inner cylinder, though not enough to allow the sand to leak out. The portion with the farm buildings was purely decorative and otherwise has no function. I also found there really wasn't enough sand to fill all the containers to their recommended levels. I did not mail away for the ants so I cannot comment on that.Overall, I found it kind of deficient in overall construction and parts. In comparison, Geo Safari's AntZone was better constructed with more accessories, though Uncle Milton's has the advantage of being expandable."
1,Dead ants...,"This was Ok to put together, but it's hard to explain to little ones why all their ants died-WASTE OF MONEY!!"
1,Really disappointed....................,"I ordered the ants first of april; ants arrived mid may. When they got here, most were dead. What few were alive died within a few days...now 3 weeks later, I have one ant alive and he is struggling. I have followed directions precisely. My daughter is sorely disappointed as insects were her Science study this year. We are really disappointed that this did not work out and it was wasted money. I would not recommend it at all. Use your money wisely."
4,Ant Farm Village,"Fun and educational - If you want to know anything about ants, just watch them!! I love ant villages, but they need to be made of a stronger plastic - for handling purposes, but mostly for shipping purposes. I also wish they made the village buildings & trees able to snap out nicely - since I would love a more natural look. Overall I would recommend this farm to children of all ages interested in watching how ants live and work together."
3,Kids Love it - Ants last about 3 weeks,"My kids love this toy - we bought extra tubing at the Home and Garden Store in our city and let the ants go up and down a spiral tunnel we made around a bottle and they thought that was great. Only two complaints on this one - the ants don't live very long (but maybe that is an added bonus for some parents!) and we actaully got a Queen. They say you are not going to get one, but we did (and I had it verified) what was sad was once she died the ants almost quit working altogether and they died within a week of her death. Otherwise, fun toy, my kids loved it and the ants came in quickly for us. (Maybe 4 weeks)"
3,Fun for a few days but thats its,"We got the ants, followed the instructions etc. The first few days my son enjoyed it. They really dug tunnels and worked very hard. But by day 4 they just started dying off. At the end of the first week all the ants were dead. If they could have just lasted a little longer I might recommend this product but its just a waste for a few short days."
5,Legendary album,"The album, ""Rastaman Vibration,"" is a very positive and legendary album. The lyrics of this album are not only strong, but they are also lyrics that are true and that you can relate to. If you love music with deep, meaningful lyrics and a catchy, interesting beat, you will definitely enjoy this CD. From the heavy bass to the well thought out lyrics, you will be begging for more and wishing for the songs to never end as you listen to each track. Each song is sure to leave Reggae fans happy and pleased. If you have ever listened to Bob Marley before or even as a first time listener, this CD is definitely one to be enjoyed by all."
2,Smoking Rabbit Tabacco Pipe,"I was disappointed to read on the third page ""The Smoking of Rabbit Tabacco Pipe"". I realize in the days of Beatrix Potter this may have been ok as part a character sketch but this book was written in 1995, a time of the ""Dangers From Smoking"" enlightenment. Did the author mean to encourage little children to smoke? We'll have to change the words to ""Bubble Pipe"" when this book is read to our grand child."
3,Could have been better.,I was a bit disappointed by this film. I was expecting a motion picture. It is more of a documentary. The caption on the back of the DVD box leads you to believe that it's a full-length movie. The acting wasn't the greatest either.
1,SHOT TO PIECES AND LEFT FOR DEAD - BOTH VERY LOW BUDGET DVDS,I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE........IT DEFINITELY IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A KEN BURNS DOCUMENTARY. THE QUALITY IS POOR/VOLUMN CONTROL WAS VIRTUALLY NON EXISTANT. FOUND MYSELF TURNING IT UP AND DOWN ALL THROUGH THE DVD. BUSSLER'S UNFORM EVEN LOOKED PHONEY WITH HIS PLAID SHIRT ON UNDER IT.........JUST NOT A QUALITY PRODUCT ......... PERIOD!
4,Fresh Cut Grass in a Bottle!!!,"Well, most perfume is subjective, particularly with body chemistry. Portfolio Green smells like freshly cut grass on me, which was a pleasant surprise! It is clean, fresh and light, a pleasant scent, not overpowering. My only complaint, doesn't last very long."
4,"Zydeco Joe, the heart of cajun country","First heard Zydeco Joe on an FM station in southern Louisiana, and of course it was 'Jack Rabbit.' I immediately set out to found out who this artist was - and within the week I had the Jack Rabbit CD in hands. Joe's music was truly from the heart and it's high energy will keep you moving. All the songs on this CD are terrific, but I'm partial to Jack Rabbit, La Cour En Arrier De Mamma Fred, Why Do You Treat Me Like You Do and La Vie De Kreyol (Creole Life).What a loss to the world of zydeco that Joe has left us. An amazing talent of cajun heart and soul. Thank you Joe!"
2,not as described,"crazy creek II sit on top kayak seat: described as 1 1/2"" seat pad, pad is actually 1"", the crazy creek III has the 1 1/2"" seat pad and a higher back. was suppose to come with 4 brass and 4 plastic clips for connection to the kayak, came with 4 brass, no plastic clips as described. was suppose to have ocean kayak installation kit, no kit included. notified amazon as to wrong description, they in turn sent me the same seat again because it said everything was included, then wanted me to return both seats, they would refund my money and I could order the crazy creek III. what a mess, they should have sent me the cc III instead of sending me the same seat a second time. the seat is quality material just does not ship with what it says and the seat pad is 1"" not 1 1/2"" still dealing with amazon on the problem..................."
3,Avoid if you can,"It gave me plenty of headaches, and a couple of sleepless nights. Unless you love and know how to use Nero, stay away from it. Not recommended for Roxio users. When it worked it performed well, but you never knew when it was going to work. I like and feel more comfortable with Roxio, and this Drive never worked 100 percent with this software. I ended up giving it away. Luckily I got it very cheap."
4,Very good product for the money,This burner is my first and for the money it was worth it. The Nero software is decent for most types of use. Unless you want cutting edge performance this burner will suffice to copy data for most users
3,Confused,"I tested an edt sample from TPC. I love the wet, green opening in this, but it heads straight for business in about 10 minutes ... and that business is patchouli with just a bit of cinnamon & spice. It's quite likable but not what I was expecting from such a revered classic. It would probably wear much better on me in the dead of winter than in the heat of summer.I bought a half bottle from e*bay, and it is a completely different fragrance. It is not a patchouli-based fragrance. Instead, it is an oakmoss-based one, and I don't like it all. Chypre with a capital C.This fragrance has two formulations, that is clear to me. I like the first one I tested, and I despise the second. Not even the same fragrances.Confused."
3,TNA Lockdown 2007 review,"The 5 way Xscape match for the X-Division title was a high-flying showstealer. The Robert Roode-Petey Williams match was a smash-mouth,simi-High-flying bout the same goes for The Gail Kim-Jackie Moore match. The Senshi-Austin Starr match was a basic/good X-Division match and the same goes the Jerry Lynn-Christopher Daniels match. The Chris Harris-James Storm-Blindfold match was boring,stupid and pointless. The Team 3D-L.A.X-Electrified Steel Cage match for the World Tag Team titles while the wrestling was not great but pretty good/solid,the fact that it was in a ""Elctrified"" cage and the buzzing sounds it made were fake,made this bout a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"" The Lethal Lockdown match was bloody,hard-hitting,hardcore,high-flying,smash-mouth and a good reminder of the Ultimate Jeopardy matches from the 1990's ECW. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10."
3,Great music - Cookie Monster Vocals,"The music is great, however, they failed to give Cookie Monster credit on the liner notes for his vocal contributions to the album."
2,Completely over-hyped....,"I once owned this album; I got sucked in by the hype and glowing reviews and after some test listenings decided that I would give it a shot. I tried to like it, I really did. I guess my tastes run more into the realm of GOOD metal, you know, Shadows Fall, Iron Maiden, Bloodbath, In Flames...What I'm trying to say here is I like my metal to be driving, with melody and/or a strong song structure that isn't faded by changes.This just sounds like a bunch of guys tuning their instruments. Sorta like jazz.If you like your metal to have a purpose and direction with a clear formula, stay away from this band.I'll give it two stars: one for being within the realm of metal, and one for being fairly well produced.That's it."
3,The Mastodon Conundrum,"Mastodon is one of those bands that, for the most part, came out of nowhere once they got television exposure. Before that, they were not very well known. I know that statement is obvious, but it leads into my point about this album..First of all, this band is not terrible. It's just that they did not exactly make me want to listen to more of their music. They were pretty good, but nowhere near the calibur of many other metal bands. The 'nature' of their music portrays brutality, but this album lacks 'raw' brutality. The subject matter present is artistic, but how it blends with the music just does not settle well with me. Bands such as Amon Amarth and Kalmah masterfully blend the lyrics with the guitars, drums, ect.. as far as this album goes, it could have been done much better.I can definitly listen to this album and enjoy it, but there is so much better out there in metal that this album quickly fades in the backdrop of my mind."
2,Is this Metal?,"It seems that nowadays all sort of noisy and yelled music has to be simply labeled as ""Heavy Metal"" (maybe music critics are in need of some professional help, as a librarian or a linguist), so Mastodon is no exception.For me, their sound is a complete disappointment: there is no guitar solo, no virtuosism, no resemblance with the type of songwriting and playing that make Heavy Metal unique, but only a grunge, Nirvana-like wall of guitars followed by a guy squeezing every ounce of air from his lungs 'til exhaustion.The only interesting point in Mastodon music is the Ginger Baker/jazz style of the drummer, who does a good and creative job behind his kit.Taking all in all, this record might be of great value for someone who appreciates grunge music, but not for true Heavy Metal fans."
2,No Thrash no metal,"First off this band doesnt Thrash so what makes them metal? Second of all I saw them live this past week as an opening act to slayer and Mastodon succeeded in putting me to sleep.. Repetative power chords is all I heard with offkey screaming. If recklessly bashing the drums and playing sloppy chords is what people compare to metallica then those critics who make that comparison are talking about St Anger metallica which isnt really metallica. If you compare this to Kill em all up to the black album, it doesnt come close.."
2,just plain... not good,"after hearing mastadon this mastodon that i was expecting something good... This album has little to offer musically and is very mediocre. I am not impressed. The person who made the comparison to St. Anger is dead on here. Luckily, i live near a cd store that takes used cds for money. i know youll buy it anyways since theres so many good reviews here, just remember: you were warned."
5,raw/ headache/ head bangin,"I have been listening to metal since its invention. My first album was Black Sabbath paranoid. Lately finding bands who's vocalists don't gargle with draino before recording their cds is almost non-exsistant. Mastodon has put it all together, this cd is what I've needed to get my fix. It's hard hitting metal, great vocals and a musical mix that shows inventive talent. If your a true metal head take a chance, you won't be disappointed."
5,Mastodon Is The Future Of Metal,"Although I did not enjoy this one as much as its predecessor ""Remission"", and it is considerably more commercial, it is still a great album. Definately the best of this year in my book, not that there's been much competition. Having the best drummer in metal music today is a big help too. At first I was disappointed, but after a few more spins, I am now digging it. All eyes are on these guys now. I pray they don't choke for the next one, although it's almost inevitable. Good luck Mastodon. Our prayers are with you. Don't pull a Metallica."
5,Essential - A Modern Classic,"Things just got a tad easier for critics piecing together best-of lists for 2004 now that everything will drown in the wake of the ""white whale.""After listening to this album about a zillion times, I honestly believe that a better album has not been released in the past five years. Period.Epic. Expansive. Massive. Catchy. Creative. Words fail me.If a better album than this is released in the next five years, I'll be stunned.Catch your breath."
5,Diggin Mastodon,I am new to Mastodon but now own 3 of their albums. This album sounds great and is a must have for any Mastodon fan. Great band and can' wait to hear more.
5,MASTODON'S MASTERPIECE!!!!!!,"MASTODON trully create a masterpiece on LEVIATHAN, their 2nd album......the band really mature the rawness and BRUTAL METAL of REMISSION, and bring more melody to their gens like BLOOD AND THUNDER, SEABEAST, ISLAND, IRON TUSK, MEGALODON amd AQUA DEMENTIA!!!!!!!! TOTALLY GREAT and RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!try LEVIATHAN and BLOOD MOUNTAIN, 2 MASTERPIECES!!!!!!!!!"
4,WOW. A heavy masterpiece.,"I am in awe of how good this ""heavy"" album is. The vocals are aggressive without makeing your ears cringe. There are amazing musical riffs that just remind me of the crashing ocean. Then there are these unbelieveable melodic, beautiful calm parts.Blood and Thunder kicks things off and sets up the whole album. My favorite piece has to be Hearts Alive. It's long and satifying.So happy I found this!"
5,Bestial!!!!,"El futuro de la musica metal esta aqui!!! Realmente este grupo es poseedor de un talento unico, son realmente originales y definitivamente PESADOS!!!!. Con unos riffs que te llegaran y mencion aparte merece su virtuosisimo baterista, estamos ante uno de los mejores bateros que he escuchado ultimamente. El detalle del disco conceptual tambien es bastante interesante mas si se trata de la legendaria bestia marina Moby Dick!. En resumen estamos ante una gran banda de metal y con ellos va a ver para rato... Definitivamente altamente recomendable!!!"
2,Generically modified,2 1/2Ambitiously crude hardcore shows proof of relevance beyond the label yet falls back on stereotypes so many times.
1,No Sale,"Take a group of guys with instruments and push them down a couple flights of stairs and then take another guy with a pound of sh*t stuck in his throat and call him a ""vocalist"" and you have this overrated CD. How in the hell anyone can say there is any Black Sabbath in this CD is beyond me. That's a huge insult to the greatest metal band of all time. If hype can get people to buy something like this, then it can sell anything. This type of crap has already been done before and apparently it will be done again and some fool will drool over it. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Better off as Lethargy.,"Lethargy was miles away from what mastodon is doing, those former Lethargy members gave up on an uncommercial challenging sound parallet to the mighty Atheist for some arena rock were only the drummer still does things right, the rest just wouldn't dare to try experimental arrangements. Adam Routier bass lines are an urgency their sound, mastodon music is just processed junk for mass consumption."
1,huh?,"i, personaly, think that this cd is boring. there is only one mediocre song which is blood and thunder. other than that, the cd is exceptionally horrible."
1,Talk about over-rated. Just boring.,"I had a listen to this band because they were being touted as being groundbreaking etc. Man, it's just the usual boring adolescent death metal. Bad vocals and a bunch of minor key riffs tied together. The guys sound like they have some playing ability but they are not anywhere near Jazz Fusion as some have suggested. This is DEATH METAL. Do not be fooled. Someone liked them to Coltrane, ha ha ha ha. Gimme a break."
1,Bought by mistake,This was an album I bought by mistake thinking it was John Elefante's band. I't wasn't and I didn't like it. Too much anger and hate.
4,Best album this year so far,Completely flawless. Heavy and melodic the same time. A huge turn away from the sounds of Remission and their eps. Buy it without thinking or breathing. Why 4 stars you say? Cuz my f**kin DVD skips.
3,way too much hype,"I really tried to like this album. I listened to its entirety several times and always come out with an empty feeling..the riffs are spectacular but most of these songs scream SOLO! However, the song just rambles on. Only song with a solo is the epic ""Hearts alive"". The main thing that I hated about this album is the fact that the vocals sound muffled, as if the singer wasnt any where near a microphone during the recording. Am I the only one that notices this? Either that or the guitars are turned way too up, anyway the sound quality BLOWS."
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE CDS,"Mastodon is an amazing band. And Leviathan is an amazing album. With such songs a ""Blood and Thunder"" and ""Iron Tusk"". What an album"
4,This Album Speaks for itself,"Mastodon is one of the best American metal bands that exist, one of the best metal bands period. Leviathan truly shows what Mastodon is capable of. There isn't really anything to say except that you should definately buy this album."
5,Oddly Alluring...,"I'm more of a death and black metal fan but this... I just don't know why, but I really like it. I guess you would call it thrash metal, and it is a really good cd. I haven't heard any of Mastodon's earlier cd's (I hear a lot about Remission, though I understand it is not as good) but this was recommended to me by another death metal fan, and I am glad I checked it out. (It is well worth any music fan's time, I promise you. And it is good to see a concept album based around a classic piece of literature! I recommend this cd. It isn't on the cd, but the video for ""Blood and Thunder"" is pretty funny and oddly enjoyable, though it has nothing to do at all with Herman Melville's classic novel!"
4,a very unique band,"mastodon is one of the most unique bands ive ever heard. this cd is very different from anything else ive listened to. they have some very nice solos scattered throughout this album and the drums are very good. the 13 minute song ""hearts alive"" is amazing and reminds me of some old metallica. the writing theme is based on mythology and they did a good job writing about it. i gave this a 4 out of 5 because i think the vocals were mixed too low, its hard to understand him at some points in the album. however, i would reccomend this to any metal fan."
2,No story line,"My five-year old is nuts about Buzz, Zurg, Booster and the crew. He likes this book, but doesn't read it all that often. There is no storyline; the book just introduces the crew. My son already knew them all. Would have liked more of the very colorful minor villans. Still, my son wouldn't part with it."
5,The product was as expected,The product arrived on time and was as described in the sale description. The product did performed as I expected.
3,Confused? You will be...,"Three stars for the illustrations, but zero for the text. Frankly, the text flow makes no dang sense whatsoever. While I accept that there could be some terribly terribly deep and clever secret to the content and sequencing of the text, it is clearly way over my head.The other books in the series are fine, and all deserve 5 stars, but this one should never have slipped past quality control. If you want to wrestle with the Zen-like quality of the non-logic, go right ahead and buy it. If you don't care whether it makes any sense and just want it for the excellent pictures, go right ahead and buy it. Otherwise, give this puppy a miss. Life is confusing enough."
5,Cortazar is great as always despite the translation...,"""Anyone who doesn't read Cortázar is doomed. Not to read him is a grave invisible disease which in time can have terrible consequences. Something similar to a man who had never tasted peaches. He would be quietly getting sadder, noticeably paler, and probably little by little, he would lose his hair. I don't want those things to happen to me, and so I greedily devour all the fabrications, myths, contradictions, and mortal games of the great Julio Cortázar."" Pablo Neruda"
3,"Not the best JPOP, but Bravo for U.S. release","While I wouldn't put Mari Iijima at the top of my list of favorite JPOP singers with T.M. Revolution, Ayumi Hamasaki, and others, I have to applaud the fact that she does have U.S. releases that are certainly good enough to listen to and enjoy. I enjoyed the inclusion of songs in Japanese on this album of mostly English tracks. And, unlike Utada Hikaru's Exodus album, the songs on Gems which were sung in English were not only tolerable, I can honestly say I liked them. Mari Iijima is the original voice actress for Macross/Robotech's Lynn Minmei, and I have to say, her music sound very similar to the music from that classic anime."
1,Waste of Time!...,"This is a terrible book if you are trying to learn fundamentals of calculus based physics. First of all, there are very few examples in each chapter. And if an example is solved, it lacks steps and details.If you are planning to take advanced courses or MCAT after using this book, well, good luck. Most of us had to use this book because it was required. Rule of thumb for Math and Physics students, it is not something that can be rote memorized. You actually have to see the worked-out problems and try to solve them yourselves. If a book doesn't contain enough examples (like this one), you are one a slippery downward slope. You may be able to get an A by memorizing every word but you won't learn anything. If you're stuck with this book because it is required, start signing up for tutoring sessions."
1,Very unclear!,"This book would be fine for a student with a very good teacher but, if you have a teacher that is very hard to understand because of his accent ,as in my case, then you need a book that makes it possible to teach yourself and this one is definitely not it!"
3,Too few examples,"Serway does a decent job explaining the concepts but there were few problem examples- and the study guide only went over a few selected problems. The color illustrations were helpful but sometimes Serway would present 13 different forms of the same formula- some with integrals/derivatives, some without, and choosing which form to use was often confusing. I have not been able to sample other physics books, but I am sure there are better choices, although this one isn't too bad. My physics professor for Physics I and II was an interesting fellow, with a twisted sense of humor and a hatred of his own car, as well as this book. I can't say that made class easier, but it certianly made it more interesting."
4,"Good, if you have the background...","This book is excellent, if u have previous highschool background in most of the topics in the book.. even if u don't u can manage.. but u have to spend more time...Knowledge of Calculus is a must..... you can get away with not using calculus on tests.. .but then u'd have to memorize formulas...... if u know the calculus.. u can derive most of the experessions needed for the solutions...."
1,Not easy to understand,"Well I bought this book because my school use it.. I found that the book is hard to understand for new physic students unless you take physic before.. The CD that comes with the book -- it is useless..So for those new physic student... this is not a worth it textbook for you... In addition, the explaination -- is hard to understand, and very confusing..So Don't buy this book--you'll be disappointed!!"
1,Terrible Text,"This book is terrible. The sections do not explain or define concepts well. The calculus isnt bad in most sections, Serway just cannot explain many concepts well. The examples seem to be either too easy or too difficult. To top it off my physics prof used a Powerpoint presentation to teach, however the presentation was produced at Illinois and does not follow Serway. For lecture the lazy prof just read off the screen at such a pace little is learned. He hated taking questions. Average exam grades are in the 40's."
3,A ok book for high school students & non-physic major...,"This book may be suitable if you were in high school, but it definitely should not be used at the University level because the author's treatment in solving physics problems is too introductory to get any true appreciation of the physics behind a problem.I definitely have a problem in the beginning chapters in which he used mainly non-calculus-based method to derive his equations for kinematics. What he should have done is derive all equations starting from just one principle (Newton's 3rd law) and shows how the equation for the non-accelating case is a special case of the 3rd law.I recommend any physic major to try other author because Serway is not the best place to start."
5,Best Grill Ever,"I sold a Weber 2000 to get the Summit Gold D. This thing is awesome, and ""big"". Quality is great. There are plenty of stainless grills out there with lots of bells and whistles, but I don't think there is one that can match the Weber Summit Gold D and Weber's after sales support."
1,"OFNA Racing Glow Starter, Aluminum, Black",Nice appearence: ButI installed a new aa battery in the glow starter it did not light the glow plug. So I tried a second aa battery still did not work. I believe a spring inside the body of glow starter is missing as the battery is not clamped down down in the glow starter.It is not worth the hassle of sending it back. Should have bought it at a hobby shop easy to take back. Oh Well
5,Wonderful program,"There are so many burning programs so ... what to do? After reading some reviews I found that this one had widescreen video support and dvd-vcr disc burning. Since this program is one of the few with these features I bought Roxio 8. I downloaded the software so it should be the latest version and no updates were needed. I like the way the program is broken up so you can easily find the menus for your tasks. I haven't tried other program so I can't say anything positive or negative about them, just that I like the one I got."
5,Followed the professional reviews,"I bought this product after reading the comparison reviews in the March issue of Smart Computing magazine. This program was ranked #1 by the reviewers (far ahead of its nearest competition, Nero 7.0). It worked as well as the reviewers said it would. Rather than wade through 100+ reviews here, it might be more time-effective to look at the professional comparison reviews out there."
4,Easy to use product,"Don't be confuse this product with high end video, photo, and sound editing programs. The biggest advantage is the disc authoring program. I've been burning loads of discs, mostly dvd-video formated ones. This is the easiest program I've used so far. I'm surprised how many formats are included now.Yes, this is great for disc burning. At the price point though the editing tools are not as rich as pro level packages. I still use a professional high end program to edit sound. That being said, I've been able to make quick fixes with the Roxio sound editor. Most people don't need the level of detail that I use so it's more than sufficient. It is also quick in making your cards, photo slide shows, collages, labels, and menus. If you need pixel editing, again this isn't the program. But if you can make due with the basics like cropping, color changes, cloning, then I'd consider this package."
5,Fingerprinting songs is a cool feature,"This weekend I finally got around to using emc8 which had been lying around for a few weeks. How great is it that you can download song info and put it into the song index. I have many music tapes and of course they are showing wear and tear. I'm doing my best to salvage them and burn the songs onto cds. There is an automatic id system where you can get song id with artist, year, album, info.The sound editor has a sound fixer so many of those scratchy glitches in the music can be fixed. With this I can salvage even more of my old music. The software already pays for itself since I've saved a ton by not buying replacement music."
5,Fastest I've been able to finish projects,"Okay I'm not so computer oriented and can't relate to some of posts written here. I can say that I like the program and made several photo albums and slide shows in less than a half hour. I could even print out labels for the disks and dvd cases by myself. To some of you that may not be major, but I tried an Avery program that only caused me grief. All the text and graphics lined up the way I wanted and fit perfectly onto the label. I even tweaked some photos. There were a lot of tools that are too intimidating for me to try now, but I could crop and fix red eyes easily. Who knows if I'll ever use the advanced programs, but the basic tasks were easy for me so I'm impressed."
5,Awesome new features,This program let me compile a lot of video clips I/'ve downloaded over the years and burn them onto a dvd. This dvd now plays in a regular dvd player. I also can't say enough about the musicID feature. I burned a lot of my MP3 songs onto an audio DVD. The id feature searhes the web and gets info on the song. What a time saver.
1,Stay away from Version 8.0!!,"All of the positive reviews here must be from a previous version of Roxio's Easy Media Creator -- Version 7.5 or below. I was very satisfied with the two previous versions. However, I made the mistake of upgrading to Version 8.0, and I have had nothing but trouble. It would take too long to explain all of it.I can't understand how a company that had a good product could have turned it into a disaster. Nothing works, and they have had no updates to the software since it came out. I can't believe that -- as it absolutely does not work. To make matters worse, they don't service or support the product. The only way to get help is to go to the discussion groups on their website, where you can read about all the problems everyone else is having and how they are trying to solve them.Bottom line: Stay away from Roxio's Easy Media Creator. Something has gone very wrong with the company and their product."
1,Junk,"I've tried to use this for the plain old simple task of burning audio CDs. At this it stinks. It gives new meaning to the terms counterintuitive and user-unfriendly. It uses 98%-99% of my CPU capacity, making multitasking totally impossible. The disk label function forces you to use wierd patterns instead of plain labels, and doesn't recongize standard Neato labels. It gives less control than you get with 7.5. I'm going to uninstall it and go back to 7.5.This piece of junk was probably written by the same idiots who did Norton PcAnywhere 11. There is a place for them, and it isn't where the sky is blue and the angels play harps."
2,Works ok but interferes with other programs,"While I have not had any problem with the suite itself, the Cinemagic codecs it installed created problems with Windows Media Player. It also has caused problems with non-media and non-Roxio programs. Though I have been able to work around these problems, the fact that it seems to have altered my system to the extent it affects totally non-related programs is of great concern to me. Customer service has also been completely non-responsive. I would strongly suggest customers find some other software for their needs."
1,The positive reviews are from Roxio who want you to buy their product,"Believe the bad review, this product is trash. I wasted my money."
1,Roxio does not want you to use their old software,"I have three very nice running WinXP machines and have Roxio 8 on two. I was very happy using the old software it work like a charm. When more new versions of Crator were release Roxio place an apps to try to disable my use of version 8 and trying to force me to upgrade. Every time I open the program it would not link me to the Roxio website and come back with annoying error. After I kept clicking the error box a number of times, then the program would work, but not without it starting again. I hate a company (Microsoft is another) that want to force users to do what they want. Leave use alone and remove the apps."
1,customer service? you can't get there from here,"I've used a number of versions of Roxio over the years, and they have gone steadily down hill. Their support is nonexistent. Registering doesn't work, and you can't send them a message if you don't register. Very cute. Their forums lead to dead pages. A frustrating crock. I'm shopping for a new product. I'm done with them."
1,Disappointing Product,"Before purchasing this product; I contacted Roxio/Sonic and inquired as to the graphic cards this product would support. I was erroneously told that it would support my particular card without any problem. Well, when I tried to capture video/audio; it DIDNOT work whatsoever. In fact; it couldn't even recognize any video signal at all. Needless to say; I was very disappointed and returned the product. I have an ATI All In Wonder 1800XL video card which is the top of the line graphic cards for capturing video. I was very sorry to find out that Sonic had tied up with Roxio as Sonic's ""My Dvd"" is the best and easiest program to use for capture. Roxio products cause several types of compatability problems."
1,Be warned about difficulty in installations!!,"Have this version of EMC 8 on another computer...worked great. However, when got a new high level Dell and went to install would not even recognize the key code. Thinking that is was prohibited I purchased a new EMC 8 and this new CD would not recognize that key code. Other non-roxio program key codes were used without difficulty. Went to the Roxio site and discovered numerous people having installation problems particularily with those who had any roxio or sonic programs in that computer, many of these may be hidden. I have tried everything known to man to get this CD to even recognize its key...no go, even with the roxio support; clean install did not work. Now any pre-loaded roxio/sonic products have been removed! My advise...stay away from ALL roxio/sonic products at ALL costs until they completely fix this install problem. I have spent too much time on this issue...go elsewhere!! Hopefully I can return this pain of a software."
2,The Worst of Both Worlds,"I was disappointed with Roxio 8.0. Having used versions 6.0 and 7.0 in the past, I was hoping that version 8.0 would be invigorated with some fresh ideas after having been acquired by Sonic. While I had found Roxio to be serviceable in the past, there were a few idiosyncrasies that I had long found annoying and had hoped that they would be eliminated in this new version. Instead, Sonic has married many of the nuisances that caused me to first choose Roxio over RecordNow with the ones already present in Roxio, to produce a product that I loath using. In fact, I removed it from my computer.This is not to say that the product doesn't work, or that it's not feature laden, just that it doesn't suit my personal preference. It's the sort of thing that, for me, tips the scales in favor Nero Ultra Edition. Many users will probably be pleased with their purchase of Roxio 8.0, but if you're on the fence and looking to decide between Roxio and Nero, my recommendation is to go with Nero."
1,This is a horrible product,"This product is great for editing video and making music disks but when it comes time to save what you've dun the program all of a sudden stops working and you get a pop-up saying that the program is not responding and we have to close. then when you go to see if your work saved, its not there, i have edited a number of videos and i have spent hours on them and then the program closes and my work is gone, there are much better products out there, windows movie maker 2.1 is a much better program than roxio."
1,Do NOT buy EMC 8.0!!!,"I have agonized over this software. The DVD I created with slideshow assistant skips over most of my 219 slides, and the company has been totally unresponsive to my online requests for help. Deinstalling and reinstalling the software didn't help. Nor can I access the Roxie Home file that is shown on the menu. This software also hangs up my computer -- this is the only program that does this to my machine. I also tried to join their discussion group on this topic, and their web site won't let me in! Do not buy this software!!! If I could rate it ""no star,"" I would."
1,Complete Waste of Money and Time,"This software has major problems - any time I opened any Roxio function, even if I closed/ended it before shutting down, my system would hang on shutdown and I'd have to manually power off. Drag-to-disk would hang and/or cause Windows Explorer to hang and I'd have to manually power off. I wasted at least 20 DVDs trying to use Backup My PC - got corrupted data messages during creation, then once I got the backup to work by deselecting all useful options, I got corrupted data messages when attempting the restore. Take a look at http://forums.support.roxio.com/ if you want to see some of the major problems people have with many of the components of this suite. After the 3rd install and uninstall and having to manually edit my registry to get rid of everything, I'm not going to try again."
1,Terrible,"Who knows, like the user who had PC-Cillin, so did I. Perhaps if I was willing to wait and leave my PC inoperable until the wonderful Roxio customer service contacted me, I too could have Roxio operating on my PC. What a bad experience. This software caused my excellent PC to bomb as soon as I installed it. I never even tried any of the functions prior to returning it primarily because the software caused my CD/DVD drives to malfunction. Trying to escape playing a CD caused ""MY COMPUTER"" to freeze. Removing Roxio restored my system to normal. If Roxio has known software/hardware incompatibilities, those should be posted right in the forefront of their help section. Come to think of it... I had Easy CD Creator 5.0 Platinum. It too had an application ""Take Two"" that destabilized my old PC so bad that I had to f-disc reformat and reinstall Windows. Last of Roxio for me! Seriously... Good Luck all of you."
1,"Okay, but awful burning DLs","I've been a long-time user of Roxio ever since v4, but as time has gone on, the product seems to have gotten worse. I have v8 and it does okay burning CDs and single DVDs, but count on a lot of coasters if you try to burn DL DVDs. The editing engine is terrible, like something from years ago. Roxio Classic no longer burns DVDs and the menus are rather confusing. You can do much better with Nero or CloneDVD."
2,Roxio Fails to Fully Deliver,"Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 8 is a great value, but be prepared to work for those saved dollars. Numerous programming glitches turn what would have been a simple, somewhat user-friendly DVD creator into a frustrating, time-consuming ordeal. I used it to create a few slideshows. My biggest frustration came when I'd add music, and all of my ""zoom & pan"" settings would disappear. Then, when I'd add ""zoom & pan"" settings, my timing settins would change. Ridiculous. Roxio would do well to FULLY test their software before rushing it to the shelves. I would have given it only one star, had it not been for the good price."
2,customer service was terrible; this should still be in beta,"don't get this software unless you dont mind paying to beta test roxio's pile of crap. customer service was horrible, the tech support website was down half the time, and the workarounds they suggest only got half of the suite to work properly. go back to 7.5 until they get 8 running properly."
1,Roxio Media Creator 8.0,I was sorry I opened the box. I just tried to edit a Sony DVD video and 8.0 was a joke. For the Menue Styles it only gives you three choices. You can click on a more choices button and it bumps you online to Roxio where you can buy more Menue Styles. Roxio 7.0 had many video Menue Styles to choose from. You think they would add more not less with the 8.0 upgrade. I wanted to delete a scene in the video and it was impossible to find the right menue to do that. I have a new Dell Demension with 1 gig of memory and fastest hard drive and processor available and 8.0 still hung up and seemed sluggish for video editing. If you have Roxio 7.0 stay with that or I am going to try a Sony video editing product. I just ate $80.
1,Trouble,This program keeps locking up. It did it during the first installation and then radomly when I try to use it. Tech support is just about non-existent. It looks like it has some nice features if you can keep it running long enough.
2,save your money,"I bought this online as a download. It is a waste of money. The user interface is frustrating and not all that intuitive, the slideshow does not let you choose less than 2 seconds. I hate their background menu picture default... why can't they let me choose no background picture at all. And wose of all, when I try to burn a VCD or DVD, it encodes to about 90 some percent, then stops and does nothing else."
2,Causes system hang and inconvenient,"I'm using the Roxio EMC 8.0 mostly for video editing and DVD burning. DV imports and CD copies were fast but the real problem was with photo slide show and video compilation during the video editing. I experienced numerous system hangs (more than 10 times a day) during the slide show creation. Content pool window was too small and I had difficulty placing a photo exactly where I wanted. Text editing tool is very basic and was not stable. I encountered a couple of system hangs during the text editing.I'll go back to Sony Movie Studio because it is very stable and easy to use. Roxio EMC 8.0 provides a lot of features, but for video and slide show creation, Sony Movie Studio works much better for me."
1,I am returning this,"I had a program in 2002 that worked better for photo editing.... none of this program is user friendly, though I did like the slideshow feature.... I am returning this.... gonna' give Adobe a shot."
1,Easy Media Creator 8.0,"I originally liked having all of their tools in one package, however, I have had undesirable internal conflicts with my notebook computer (new in January 2006) and the DVD drive. I could not tolerate all of the issues with this software, so I have uninstalled it from my computer. Had I known the issues, I would have saved my money and not made the purchase."
1,Roxio EMC 8 is 2 steps backward in MP3 functionality,"I bought Roxio EMC 8 after using Roxio 6. I recently purchased a new Dell and of course the ""free"" media software that came with it was all ""lite edition"",trail ware none of which has full functionality, or requires the purchase of plug-ins. So with my experience with Roxio 6 I assumed 8 would be a good tool to create and organize my MP3s. I was wrong. Roxio EMC 8 has less MP3 functionality than Roxio 6. Furthermore, there customer support is very difficult to navigate. I want an 800 number or an email address. The Roxio site forces customers to register and be at the mercy of a bulletin board forum for any and all truly technical support.In all fairness I did not use the other functions of EMC 8. As I said I bought it for its MP3 functionality, not so much the other stuff."
1,Zero stars,"This has got to be the flakiest software I've ever attempted to use. It has several applications. The only one that worked is the classic cd creator, an old Adaptec program. The rest all fail. My system has a fresh XP SP2 install, and plenty of horsepower. Nero works great. I was able to find a way to burn Tivo shows with Nero as well."
1,A Tivo No-go,"I bought EMC8 because of its support for the Tivo file format. Like other reviewers, I found that the program ran VERY SLUGGISHLY and sucked up nearly all of the resources on a dual Pentium 4 Xeon workstation with oodles of memory. I wasn't able get further than adding a Tivo file and creating a menu before the program would crash.Contacting tech support via email several times elicited no response. I managed reach a tech support rep without being charged $35 by going through customer service; the advice I received did nothing to resolve the issue.Don't waste your time or money on this worthless software.I'm still searching for a fast, reliable way to archive Tivo files to DVD."
5,The Best,"Never had a program to work with so many feathers. So much to learn, so much you can work with and do. Don't think there is another program out there that can TOP this one."
5,Beyond Belief,"I was waiting for emc8 and bought it the first week it came out. Unfortunately there were some bugs, especially in the menu creator. I called Roxio and they said there was an update. I downloaded the update and then everything was fixed. There were some greyed out buttons that reappeared after the fix was installed. If some people are having this problem it is easy to make the correction. The customer service was free.Since that time I've had time to play around with the software and have discovered a lot of useful things. Everytime you add a video to your dvd, it creates a button. You can then edit the button with your choice of text and style. The label maker also is accurate. I gave up on the Avery program as it never worked right."
1,BEWARE!!! Alters file modification dates!,This program added some information to hundreds of jpg files on my hard drive and changed the file modification dates without my knowledge. I usually refer to programs like this as viruses. I ended up reloading a 250 MB website because the web editor thought I had replaced all of my photos. Roxio customer service non-responsive after two days. Ended up doing a system restore to eliminate all traces of this horrible program. Doesn't deserve even 1 star for all of the grief it has given me.Update - 9 days later and still no response from Customer Service.
5,Still relevant,"I know version 8 has been around for sometime so I wondered whether or not the features would still be relevant and worth getting, or else wait for another version, whenever that may be. Thanks to the www I've been able to get some data and then made the purchase. After a few weeks of use I haven't found anything lacking. I've been able to make widescreen videos and slide shows. My dvd player handles dual layer discs and this program lets you make them. Is there some other format that I haven't thought of or perhaps may be launching? At any rate I know that this will keep me content for at least a year or 2. I don't plan to upgrade my digital camera, camcorder, nor dvd player until they break down, so I know I have the software support."
1,Parts of this program just don't work,"I'm very disappointed with this software. I tried to make a DVD on my home computer using MyDVD and the software actually rebooted my machine while I was adding video from a file on the hard disk. I tried it again and it rebooted my machine again! So I moved the software to my laptop from work and, although it didn't reboot the laptop, it wouldn't actually produce the DVD either. Basically, this is an unreliable piece of junk. I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I'm going to download the 30-day Nero Ultra Edition 7 trial and hope it works better."
1,Stick with version 7,"I have been a user of the Easy Media series of products from its early days as an Adaptec product. Prior to V8, I was very happy with it. V8 is a huge leap backwards, however. It is slow, more difficult to use and very unreliable. Roxio service used to be good, now it seems non-existent. The only reason to get this is if you need to burn TiVo programs, but Roxio now has problems doing that. The message boards for both Roxio and TiVo have long lists of complaints.I would go with Nero unless you need the TiVo functionality"
1,World's Worst Tech Support,"I purchased version 8 and apparently was unlucky enough to get a defective CD. I left a request with Tech Support in which I fully described my problem and which contained ""screen shots"" of the error messages. The request remained unanswered for weeks after which I just gave up and returned the product.This may be a great product. I never got a chance to find out. Let my experience serve as a warning...if you have a problem, you might as well throw the program away. There is NO help available."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS USELESS PRODUCT!!!,"I bought Roxio Easy Media Creator 8.0, and beleive me there is nothing easy about it. It crashed my computer and after I tried all the solutions to make it work, the program would not respond at all. I was lucky that I have Symantecs GO BACK program, I was able to get my drive and my old Roxio 5 back. I thought it was time for me to upgrade to Roxio 8 since it seemed I was getting behind. Little that I know that it was goin to take me all night long trying to UNINSTALL Roxio 8 and fix everything it messed up. Let me tell you, STAY AWAY FROM THIS WORTHLESS SOFTWARE. ROXIO SHOULD BE TARRED AND FEATHER FOR CREATING SUCH A PROBLEM TO CONSUMERS. If you have enemies and want to take care of them, tell them to buy Roxio 8.0, that will really fix them."
1,Crash Landing,"I bought Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 because I have owned most Roxio media creator versions going back to version 2 or 3 and found them to be very useful and reliable. Unfortunately, using this version my machine hangs about every third time I try to edit a video. Also the installation added a driver for my CD+/-RW drive which essentially made it invisible to Windows XP. I resolved the problem by buying a competitive product which worked fine on my system (after I removed the offensding driver)."
1,Crash after crash after crash after crash,I have 1.5 gigs of ram on a less-than-year-old HP computer and all this progam does is crash. What a waste of 99.00. I should have heeded the warning of all of those 1-star ratings this junk got.
3,Good for the computer literate,If you are looking for easy to use software then this is it if you have a state of the art computer with massive memory. Otherwise beware. And if you are looking for a package that has good customer support then this is not what you are looking for. It took hours and hours of pain and suffering to finally make this work. Unfortunately most of the good programs of this type are memory hogs and bad customer service. que sara
1,You'll Be Sorry,"I upgreded to Roxio 8.0 in hope that it would be a more stable product than their 7.5 version. This one is even worse. After spending hours on a DVD project, Roxio would no longer open the file. Hours and my $69 lost. To get my system working again, I had to resort to using Windows System Restore. To make matters worse, the ""Suite"" product has several features missing -- they want you to buy the version with the useless Dazzle adapter if you want a full featured product. However, more features = more opportunities to crash your project or worse yet your system. This product is not ready for distribution!"
1,Worst Violation of PC Privacy Ever!!!,"I just want to warn people. This product, while a big improvement over v7, should tell you a few things before you have spent your money. Now a subsidiary of Sonic, the software is not functional until you accept a new policy which sets new standards for invasion of privacy. The lengthy agreement preceding registration warns that information will be gathered from your computer and may be shared with law enforcement and as a result members of the armed forces are warned against registration if they mind sharing what they do with or store on their PC. Most of the program won't fuction unless you register it. And it doesn't even work with my burner which is a Sony. I am law abiding, but don't like knowing that every time I use the internet it may share what is on my system or about my life for others to review. Make sure you are comfortable with the fine print!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS SOFTWARE!,"I have had this software for over a month and it is absolutely horrible!First the compute I'm using is brand new and exceeds every system recommendation for the software.1- Crashes EVERYTIME you render video. EVERYTIME! I have NEVER rendered anything on the first 2 attempts.2- Audio Sync is nonexistant! ANYTHING you injest, the audio and video are NEVER in sync.3- Burn/Render quality is ALWAYS LOW! No matter what the settings are when you burn or render the quality is lowered. Most video ends up looking like something taken with a cell phone, that is NOT an exaggeration.4- Features? It's loaded with features...good features. But what good are they if they never work on the completed project.I bought this software because of past, very good, exper. w/ Roxio. This software will keep me from ever buying anything of their's again.You will waste you $80!"
3,Great when it works,"Based on my experience, these reviews, and the Roxio forums, this is perfectly decent software on the right computer. Several of the components, which are essentially separate programs, are by now overly elaborate and complex but they do the job. The problem is that, while most software has problems running on a few systems with unusual hardware or software configurations, EMC 8 has problems on many systems. These problems can make it impossible to boot run some components at all and prevent others from working properly. Roxio customer service can help with simple problems, such as incompatibilities with antivirus programs, but others have yet to be figured out. In my case, for example, the program will not run on my relatively plain Dell but does fine on my ThinkPad, for reasons nobody has apparently come close to understanding. EMC 8 isn't bad but be warned that its the luck of the draw whether it will work for you."
1,"Sham, New out of the box, NEEDED UPDATE","I purchased EMC8, Jan '06, installed and registered this product. Update is offered, 114 MB update at that, I can't download this on my slow dial-up takes over 21 hours. Web Customer support ticket response, not helpful. Toll Free support number refers you back to self help or option of PAID help.Shortly after registering, I now receive constant emails from Roxio/Sonic asking me to upgrade to EMC-8. This company is oblivious to customer needs. Today, they announced another bigger better EMC8 Deluxe Suite. This product was not tested in house, but sent out to retailer. I believe they are field testing on customers.This was and is a total waste of money and time."
1,"cumbersome, difficult, and not intuitive","I used earlier versions, and found them less problematic. This version 8 was a problem from the very beginning. It has compatibility problems with microsoft explorer. It is very touchy, and if you make a mistake, it is hard to correct. There are very few fail safes. The documentation just misses the boat, and appears to be old and not up to date. I tried customer service, and even paid for the support. I was disappointed with the service. This program does a lot, perhaps too much. If they focused the software, perhaps they would do a better job."
1,Abysmal on line customer support,"I purchased this product in July. I have been unable to write successfuly to double layer disks. I have one ticket that has been open for SEVEN weeks. I get very generalized answers to very specific questions. The latest suggested solution was to download the lastest PX Engine, but the link provided by Roxio was only for versions 7 and LOWER. I have version 8; no link for version 8 PX Engine is available. It has been 27 days since my last update to the ticket without a response from Roxio. Totally worthless online support. There is no free phone support. Each call costs you half the price of the product. Don't waste your time or money on this product."
2,Good Points but Beware,"I have had good experience with Roxio in the past and this product has the potential to be good, if and when they update it. Features that previous versions have are missing here. Oh to be sure, they are on the menu, but they are grayed out and inaccessable. For instance, if you want ""Play All"" on a menu, don't buy this product. Or wait and see if they add that feature. Go to the support boards and see the number of people who liked earlier products and have regretted buying this new one. I am prepared to return mine for refund."
4,Software is always returnable if you want,"You can always find a seller who will give you a time period for returning software. I know that over the years stores have tightened up their policies because some people will load the software then return the package, even though they are using the program. It's easy to check return policies so I have no sympathy for those who say they couldn't return the product. (...)I know that Roxio's customer service over the years has been good as far as I'm concerned. I've called a few times and have written e-mails. In each case I've gotten the necessary help and it never cost me anything.I just installed emc8 and there were none of the problems that people have mentioned here. It is a large program with advanced features so you do have to check the minimum specs before you buy it. My pc has the bare minimum required so I was concerned that it may not work. However it is running AOK and it is a great media program."
5,Well oiled machine,"My pc has 256 RAM and the roxio program runs smoothly. As many people have pointed out this is an easy program to use. The update files on the Roxio Web Site are easy to install and should fix most problems. I'm happy to report that EMC8 is up and running on my pc and I've been able try most of the programs. Since I heard some complaints about the tivo files I tried burning some tivo programs to a disk. The program recognizes the files and does the necessary conversions to transfer them to a disc. I can't think of a way it could be made easier. The tivo function is only the tip of the iceberg. I'm still digging into the numerous photo and video editing options. In summary, big program, small learning curve, no major bugs."
2,Easy Media Creator causes shutdown problem,"I take exception to the reviewer that says ""skip the reviews by regular users and just use Professional reviews"". I am a PC tech, had problems with earlier versions so I thought version 8 would solve them. It did solve one, but my computer became unstable and began taking 5 minutes to shutdown. I finally discovered ROXWATCH.EXE was the culprit in ""SERVICES"". I stopped it from running and at least my PC acts normally again in shutting down."
1,Remove this product and restore from a good backup,"Roxio 7 was not the greatest product, but you could accomplish most media related amateur projects. Roxio 8 must have been coded by the two Taiwanese teenagers who wrote the Symbian operating system for my Nokia phone (they are still laughing). Today I get a ""super offer"" on an incredible discount for the all new Roxio 9 Suite (only 70 bucks)! I will not be the guinea pig this time. I'll wait for another poor soul's tearful review. Constant thanks to Hollywood and the RIAA, my DRM guardians."
1,Avoid Roxio Media Creator 9,Verion 9 of this software should be avoided at all costs. It locks up machines on a regular basis (even during launch) and has no capabilities to justify the cost. This software doesn't even provide a way to define the media library (stuff you want to manage). It just grabs everything (do I need to manage icons and images from other applications ??). I an very disatisfied and would recommend that you look to Ulead or Nero for better solutions.
2,Problems with Creator 8.0,"I got Roxio easy cd creator LE on by new Dell desktop and it never would recognize my dvd rw drive. I bought Easy Media Creator 8.0 believing it would solve the problem. It did - 8.0 recognized my drive but kept locking up when I tried to use some of it's features. I was never able to get to a live Roxio person for help. The Dell/Roxio help person essentilly gave up and suggested I try Nero 7 as a trial for 30 days, so I downloaded Nero 7 and it seems to be problem free, so I purchased the retail version. I think Roxio and it's installation setup is not up to release status. They should fix the problems before they sell it to the unsuspecting public! This may be an OK program feature-wise but technical support needs to be improved."
1,Very S;low for DVD creation - almost unusable,"I bought this software and a brand new desktop computer with a dual core processor, 1gb ram etc. figuring a new system would easily be able to handle the processing requirments for doing simple videos. All I wanted to do was tape old vcrs and other family videos and turn them into dvds so we have more copies etc. The software is very difficult to us, conflicted with my antivirus software, has terrible directions, nil support, and the performance is so slow that it is almost unusable. I went out and bought Adobe Premier Elements 2 which works much better although it needs digital content so the vcr's had to be imported by roxio first. Amazing that it is this difficult to simply take videos that are 7-16 years old and convert them into dvd's. this software is a joke for dvd creation and they should be ashamed to market it as such."
4,Simply one of the easiest to use,"I agree with many here that this is an easy program to use. I thought that burning dvds would be complicated and was ready for a lot of trial and error. I think this program eliminates the complexity. If you want to copy a disk choose the disk copy menu item, if you want to make a music dvd choose that option. There's a lot of other features but the disk burning is most important."
1,Most frustrating program i have ever bought,"This is one of the worst programs i have ever bought. I had used Roxio version 6 and like it a lot. Because of this i paid 99.00 dollars to get the latest version.I tried to use it mainly to create dvd's of my personal vacations. I have had all kinds of problems. Problems encoding video, crashes, errors,. Sometimes i think everything is working thru the extremeley, extremely slow process of making a project. When it actually finishes, with what you think are no errors, it does not play.I have spent hours trying to read thru all the problems others have had and doing all kinds of things to correct the problems to no avail.This program is a piece of worthless crap."
2,EMC 8 balanced review,"I have bought Roxio EMC 8 from Amazon. I (try) use it to create DVD disk from digital high 8 tapes; also use its drag disk feature.The software has the overall impression that it was made with Dilbert's pointy hair boss in charge. It is loaded with features, video / audio editing and burning, label making etc, but unfortunatelly a lot of these modules are buggy. A few wrong keystroke and the system locks up, sometimes completely, requiring a hard boot. It also is so slow, perhaps because it was written in Java, that it gives you the impression that you are not getting a response from your own computer but from another galaxy.There is few better competing products. If you bent on buying this product, do yourself a favor and buy it from Roxio's web site, becasue from there you get a 30 day money back guarantee - and there is a good chance you will want that guarantee."
1,Some of the worst service I have ever experienced,I could only recommend this product and company to my worst enemies and then I would still feel guilty. Their idea of technical support is either $35 a phone call or a website that does not appear to work in any way shape or form. I feel sorry for anyone going to purchase this product and plan on returning my one unfortunate copy and my earliest possible moment.
5,disk burning made easy,Its hard to imagine another program that does so many things. I thought that disc burning would be a matter of choosing between a few formats only. There is so much more which I learned once I opened up the menus. I guess some formats need file conversions so they work on a disc. This software will handle the conversions after you decide what disk format to burn. The virtual disk is a big help so you can do disk copies without having to reread a disk. I've tried burning one music dvd. The program has compression options so you can opt for higher quality or try to fit as much as possible. At any rate the Roxio menus are easy to navigate so you can get your burning done quickly.
1,Warning!!! Worst Experience Of Any Software!,"Buyer beware! Not only was this program far from actually working, the customer service when requesting assistance was atrocious. I've been a loyal Roxio user, but this is is, by far, the worst program I have ever installed. Besides freezing up my computer during every project I attempted, it would lock out my CD/DVD Drives. I would create a slideshow only to be unable to write it to a disc. A total waste of time and money!"
1,Bootleg copy!,"This is exactly why I support personal bootleggingIf you like it, buy it.If it's trash, trash it...no money lost!But this is only cool if you do buy it, if you wind up using it."
1,Problems galore.,"I am experienced user of Videowave 7. The level 8 version is full of small problems that make the software unusable. After several attempt to make it work right I went back to version 7.Roxio has a reputation for putting out programs with problems. I bought previous versions and had to send them back because they either didn't work right or they tied up my system. Version 7 worked pretty good and I thought version 8 might introduce new features. With version 8 Videowave however has numerous functional problems.What compounds the problem is that their support is not there. I wrote their support and they did not even answer. If you call there is a $30 charge even when you first purchase the product.It is a shame because the software has a lot of great features, if it worked. It doesn't. People that have had good luck with it are using the simplest features. Those features are available in Windows or for a lot less money."
5,Burn baby Burn,Since I got EMC8 I've been doing a lot of disk burning. I can't think of any other way the options could have been laid out more efficiently. I have 2 burners and this software supports multi disk burning. I've been taking advantage of the feature and have cut my burning time in half.I've tried moving songs to the dvd in compressed and uncompressed formats. I couldn't tell the difference so I'm using the compression option. You can fit a lot more songs that way. At least you are given the choice. If you are an audiophile you might consider this option. The dolby digital sound has let me burn identical quality music onto dvds. I'd say that you can't go wrong with creating your music discs with this program. It's hard to imagine any other program could make the process any easier.
4,Stop the clutter and get organized,"My pc desktop is one big mess since I'm not too good at separating the files into folders. Imagine my surprise when I opened up the easy media software for the first time and saw all my media files organized under photos, videos, and sound. The main menu has a media manager that points to all the media files, as long as they have the right extensions, and lets you access them by type. I saw files that I had forgotten about and couldn't remember where they were on the pc.Now that I have access, it was easy to burn cds and free up the hard drive. The slide show maker was stellar too. The program lets you click on the photos and then puts them in a show. There are various templates and styles to choose from. I have a bunch of short video clips which I also saved on discs. I haven't gotten around to editing the video but at least everything is backed up and I now have more room on my pc to handle video editing."
2,Don't buy this product now,Installed ver 8 on a new Dell XPS400. It ran very slowly but I did create a music cd from a download. The video editing did not run right from the beginning and downloading an update from Roxio did not help. When I run the software it starts ok but then stops responding. The computer then takes 5 minutes to shut down on a restart. Left a service request on the Roxio website 2 days ago... still waiting for response. This product looks good on paper but my advice is to wait until they get the bugs worked out.
1,A total loss,"I installed this program and can't even figure out how to cut a scene out of my video file. I don't even know how to mark chapters using this kluge. The online help desk apparently doesn't know how to do this either. If you want something other than to just burn cd's, look elsewhere. Do you have any suggestions for a program that will allow me to edit video??"
1,Terrible Product,"This product isn't even worth reviewing except to say it is : 1)Unstable; 2) Non-intuitive; 3) A horrendous waste of money.Stay far, far, away from this product."
3,Troublesome,"I too have had major problems with this program after installation. I also thought that I had virus or spyware issues on my Dell desktop but realized that it was just this program! If you are able to use it, it seems like a great program but all I'm getting is ""hung up"". I don't think I would recommend this program because of the many issues that people are having with it and I wish that I read the reviews more carefully...BUYER BEWARE"
1,"Doesn't work with my video capture card, no customer service",I bought this mess as an upgrade to the free MyDVD that came with my computer. Big mistake. First of all the MyDVD that comes with the program is not the prevous version of MyDVD made by Sonic. They only share the same name. I was prevously able to capture video and put it directly on DVDs with one step. All a really needed was the upgrade to compress the video to make two hours fit. The program cannot switch the input on my Hauppauge video card even though it is Windows MCE certified. The old MyDVD had not problem with this. The program also will not allow direct to DVD with MPEG2 capture cards. This is a downgrade from what I could do before. If you want to call someone and get help it will cost you $35. You can join a discussion group of other people with problems however.
2,Roxio at its Worst,"I bought this program specifically to burn DVD slideshows for my mother-in-law. I have tried all DVD creation products in the ""suite"". The preview button does not show a preview. Then after encoding for DVD, VCD or SVCD - a time consuming process - I get an immediate burn error. I refuse to spend $35.00 for telephone tech support and the online support is non-existent. The rest of the program works fine, but I have switched to Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 for anything to do with photo editing or slideshows. Much better results."
1,Instruction manual a complete puzzle,"The instruction manual for this product is about the poorest written I've come across in years. I had to buy two other manuals in order to figure out how to do the simplest task. I am currently most interested in generating slide shows. For this purpose, Adobe Photoshop Elements version 4.0 is vastly superior. I was able to begin creating slide shows in minutes."
5,good software,It's taken me a long time to try doing much outside of wordprocessing and emailing on the computer. My husband bought me this program and I'm so glad he did. I was able to figure out a lot myself including how to burn a disc. There's a good program that makes photo cards which is perfect for families. I've even done some cropping and color adjustments. I would recommend this to anyone who is intimidated by learning new things on the computer. It's made my life easier.
2,"Great for Guatamala and Southern Mexico, but.....",If your travel are solely to Guatemala and the Yucatan this guide is for you. But if your planning on traveling in Belize (Central America's best country) this guide seriously lacks in Belizian facts and data. That is why I only gave it 2 stars. I would guess if your going to Guatamala or the Yucatan the book is spectacular but for Belize there are many better guides.
2,very poor for belize and Peten,"This is possibly the worst Lonely Planet guide I have encountered in 20 years of global travels, mainly using LPs. I bought this guide expecting it to deal with Belize thoroughly, as the title of the guide was ""Belize, G and Y...""; however if you look at the actual Belize contect it just amounts to a hundred pages or so out of 600. Vast parts of the country were absent, and though northern Guatemala was a little better there were several ruins missing compared to my partner's Rough Guide to the Maya World. I have always wanted to visit the Peten ruins of Piedras Negras on the Usumacinta river, but the LP did not even cover the site. All in all I have this book was weak, certainly compared to other LP titles I have used over the years."
3,A bit disappointing,"I agree with the other two reviewers...as far as Lonely Planet guides go, this book was a disapppointment for the areas of Belize and Yucatan I was visiting. There was barely any information for Cozumel, which is a popular destination these days, although maybe a little ""upscale"" for the average backpacker. Belize is a country with so many more things than what were highlighted in the book...best to find another guide before going off to explore on your own."
5,the essential travel guide on this region,"I recently traveled through Central America and southern Mexico for two months and found this book absolutely invaluable. I don't know how I would have managed without it. It provides good information on everything, especially on how to get from point A to point B. Before leaving for my trip, I checked out a number of other guides, and none of them even came close to matching the usefulness of Lonely Planet. Almost all travelers in this region use Lonely Planet guides. I highly recommend this book.One other note: Let's Go Mexico and Let's Go Central America are both jokes. Let's Go Central America is so bad that I wouldn't even recommend flipping through it."
1,Not worth the money!,I recommend not even looking at this book! It only solves the problems that are in red in the text book and usually there is only 5 or so! Don't waste your money or time!
1,A rip-off indeed,"This ""solution manual"" is a total waste of money. Only a few problems each chapter, and most of them are the easy ones. Save your money. You can spend the same amount and get the REA problem solvers book which will serve you a million times better."
1,This book isn't worth it.,All the negative reviews of this book are completely accurate. And to make matters worse it is for the sixth edition and not the more current seventh edition.
5,"Study And Solutions Guide For Calculus, Volume 2","The Study And Solutions Guide For Calculus, Volume 2, is an excellent ""continuation"" book for solutions to calculus.JML"
1,Like walking on boards,Without a doubt these are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever put on. They are so stiff and the straps kill the top of my feet. They are definitely going back. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't offer free return shipping like most other online shoe sellers.
1,shoe lover,"This shoe is poorly made. They look really nice when you get them,but when you wear them they rip apart. They also feel like you are walking on a stiff board. I do not recommend this shoe."
2,Not impressed...poor by MIA,"I usually love shoes by MIA. I have several pair. But like the other review... the inside tie strap is not really in the tie and does come off. I LOVE the style and they are comfy...so I plan to take them to get repaired... but know if you buy them, you will likely have to do the same before you wear them a 2nd time."
1,These sucks!,I thought the shoes were adorable but one broke the first day I used them. Major bummer!!!
1,Not good!,"I just received these in the mail and loved them and they were very comfortable. After one day of wearing them, the strap broke right at the thong. I wouldn't buy these, they're poorly made."
5,Better every listen!,"I admit it. I thought this was a silly idea for an album, and only purchased it to maintain my collection's completeness. But when I listened to it, I fell in love with its casual flair and its odd take on kiddie standards. Every time I listen to it, I love it more and more.I am a thirty-something adult with no kids, and I love almost every song on this album (Ol' Blue excluded). This is definitely the musical equivalent of ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" : A surreal trip that leaves you happy. If you are trying to decide which of the latest WIllie albums to buy, this is the one (NOT ""The Great Divide"")."
3,Didn't like most of it,"It seems Willie did not really want to make a children's record - which is too bad because I'd enjoy having it around and we play Willie records all the time in our house anyway - might as well have some child-themed tunes.The first half of this album is mostly pretty bad...the recording of ""Four Leaf Clover"" just leaves you looking at your stereo and wondering why anyone would record that...particularly in that fashion. However, The 33rd of August is fantastic and so is ""Just Dropped In To See What Condition My Condition Was In""...if Willie had made an entire album of this sound, it would have been another great Willie Nelson record.But this is what you get with greatness...with all of Willie's recordings, this is about the 2nd one I haven't truly enjoyed - that's a pretty awesome track record."
1,rainbow never gets connected,This is bloody awful. I want my money back. I am a fan and have most of his cds but this is the worst. Has he ran out of material>??????? Don't waste your money...
5,pink kitchaid euro peeler,"this is better than my small tupperware one, i'm a tw consultant & all the pink kitchenaid stuff is fantastic."
3,Disappointing but cute color,"I have the entire KitchenAid cook for the cure product line and this is one in the collection that leaves a bit to be desired. I love the color and it's a nice weight and size. However, it's not very sharp and takes a while to get things peeled. My cheapo peeler works faster and better. It could be the angle of the peeler blades isn't quite right but I get a lot of misses when I peel things like potatoes and cucumbers. Since I don't peel that much it's not a huge problem for me but if you're trying to peel 10 lbs of potatoes it will be an issue. I might get another one and see if I just got a dud. 3 stars because it's pink but not totally functional."
5,Your child will absolutely love it!,"I bought this at a book fair earlier this year for my 3-year olds birthday and it has been consistently in his top 3 favorites. Sung to ""Shoo Fly Shoo"" it at first seems repetitive (cows in the kitchen, pigs in the pantry, etc.) but things change halfway through making it a fun read for both parent/teacher and child! The big bright pictures are engaging for even the youngest readers and the older ones will have fun searching for the white mouse who hides on each page. Have lots of fun with this book!"
5,The ledgend lives,"When I bought this Christmas CD by Dionne Warwick I really did not expect it to become my staple for Christmas music over the season. But, as I listened to the new interpretations of old classics by this old master of pop - I realized that is seems as this Diva of the 60s moves into her 60s - Dionne has settled into a genre that is suited for her unique sophisticated style and phrasing once again. The more I heard the more I was drawn to the music and genuineness of her interpretations of what Christmas must represent to her. The melodies and music mixed with her matured voice are soothing and lush. Christmas feels relaxed and warm and less hectic and cold and I remember why Christmas is ""My Favorite Time of the Year"" too. Dionne thanks once again for the music - may you have many happy and peaceful Christmases ahead"
4,At Long Last,"So happy to finally have something new from Dionne. Her voice isnt as strong as it once was, but it fits perfectly into the soft, jazzy arrangements on this Christmas CD. A real pleasure to listen to. Worth adding to anyone's Holiday CD collection. Some nice duets with Gladys Knight and Bebe Winans too."
5,Brilliant,"You either get it or you don't. For those of you who get the joke behind the joke behind the joke this is a fantastic DVD. I laugh so hard I have tears in my eyes with every viewing. Go ahead and riff on your own at the next family gathering. Better yet, buy a dozen copies and give them out as Christmas gifts."
3,mixed bag,"I found it a little hard to stay with this the entire running time. Overall, a few hilarious commentaries here and there kept me hanging on, but yeah, the joke is annoyingly lame. Dana Gould (the voice of Gex in the videogame of that title) has a hilarious take on an Amish version of the joke. I credit this one for introducing me to Sarah Silverman (a favorite of other reviewers here), so I would recommend her ""jesus is magic"" movie over this in a heartbeat if you're in the mood for rude, crude and hilarious."
2,Too inside. A professional joke.,"As these professional comedians prove, it may indeed be the words dirtiest joke. But it is never the same. They all tell it with diferent details, apparently trying to be more disgusting than the version that came before. I could not tell this joke & get a laugh. That's where thes guys come in. The big laugh is the telling of the joke. ""The Aristocrats!"" is the punchline. To me not particularly funny. The dvd extras had some of the comdians favorite jokes & a tribute to Johnny Carson & his favorite joke are marginally better. I guess the trip is fuunier than the destination as far as comedians are concerned."
2,100 comedians and it still isn't that funny,"100 comedians beat a not very funny joke into the ground, dig it up, and beat it some more. George Carlin is too old for potty humor, really, folks. The funniest take on the joke may be the guy who does it with a deck of cards. Drew Carey is funny because he tells a better joke about a pianist. Bill Maher's take on the joke is better because he changes the punchline. Pat Cooper rightly says the joke isn't that funny in the first place. Kevin Pollak is funny because he mostly just gives us his Christopher Walken impression. And Jerry Seinfeld comes out better than any of them by not appearing at all. This film shows that gross does not mean funny. Just watch Airplane! again if you need further proof. This movie is at the level of the kid in grade school who said ""poo-poo"" and ""pee-pee"" until he got a laugh. When you're 50 and still doing that, it's time to find new material."
2,"OK, not as funny as I would have hoped","A reviewer below writes, ""No question, the funniest movie I've ever seen. I laughed so hard and so much my face hurt, my stomach hurt."" If you think this is the funniest movie ever, you need to get out and see more comedies, my friend. Maybe I saw a different movie, but at no time did my face or stomach hurt while watching The Aristocrats. I mean, it was OK, maybe worth a rental if you're in the mood. But I only laughed a couple of times in 80 minutes. The rest of the time I wondered why this was hailed as a hilarious documentary. Amusing, sure. But hilarious? Nah. It says something when the funniest comedian in the movie is a mime."
2,It's All Intro,"I kept wanting to fast forward through this movie to hear the comedians tell their version of the joke, which they very rarely did. Some of the other reviews have it right, this movie is all about how a joke is told. If you want to watch a documentary on comedy, get this. It's occasionally funny, not all it's cracked up to be."
1,Anything but...,"...funny and brilliant. I REALLY REALLY tried to watch through the first few minutes. I walked away, but decided to watch the remainder since I bought the CD upon the recommendation of a few friends who claimed that it was ""absolutely brilliant"".Basically, it's about a very vulgar joke, and all these comedains narrate their version of it. The joke isn't funny, and the comedians seem like they ramble on and on and explain why the joke is funny and whatnot. Fact of the matter is, they all try too hard, and there's nothing funny and intelligent or deep about it."
1,A PAUPER OF A MOVIE,"Can you give a minus star rating? If I could, I would give THE ARISTIOCRATS a minus one star. THE ARISTOCRATS is undoubtedly the most boring and unentertaining movie in a long time. Imagine some comedians sitting around talking about a joke that is not even funny. Imagine that ""plot"" for a WHOLE movie. And then some of them tell the same unfunny joke their own way, which is still not funny. And, to top it off, the joke is filthy. The only redeeming value of this DVD is that aspiring comics might learn a modicum of technique from it. Otherwise, THE ARISTOCRATS is a pauper of a movie and, unless you are into scatological ""humor"", I recommend that you skip this one."
1,Feeble and lazy direction is not redeemed by crude humour.,"I am no prude and I am not easily shocked. This was not funny or shocking but a very badly edited mish-mash of little bits of cuts from a series of interviews. I could not believe that anyone would have the nerve to actually sell this rubbish.My impression is that we are supposed to find just the idea of the underlying joke so funny that we don't actually need to have it told to us. The sales pitch, if only implied (the producers must have obtained legal opinion as to whether it was a swindle or not), was that the Aristocrats joke would be told by a variety of well-known comedians. If this is what you are hoping for - you will be sadly disappointed!"
2,The Aristocrats - Dog Poop,"Absolute Dog Poop - with corn. So there is this joke that all the comedians know about, and there are a million ways to tell it, and they get really raunchy. There, that's the movie. I saved you two hours. Oh but there's a kicker, the joke isn't funny and everyone knows it. Yet, of course, some of the comedians tell it like it's the funniest thing in the world - Sarah Silverman, Gilbert Godfried, Bob Sagat, and South Park are definite highlights. And I love Sarah Silverman. However, the awful cinematography, horrific editing, and terrible production value of this film make impossible for me to fathom why people didn't burn down the theaters when they realized this film wasn't getting any better. I would have at least demanded a refund, and $100/hr billed in 15 minute increments. I think Sarah Silverman saved the day again."
1,"not funny, just inane","Trying to move a product by being as vile as possible is a poor excuse for something marketed as humorous. Even though top comics are involved, the Aristocrat joke format is tiresome as every possible combination of themes on scat, bestiality, and incest is played out ad nauseam. The documentary style of endlessly discussing the joke and its supposed merits is also tedious. Save yourself some money by searching for aristocrat jokes on the internet to get an idea of what the joke is all about. If you can't get enough of that style of perversion, then maybe you might like this film after all."
1,"boring, choppy, and repetitive","Rented this movie expecting to laugh. Didn't think it was funny at all. The camera jumps from person to person as they sit in chairs and describe the first time they heard this raunchy joke, that really just isn't funny to begin with. I kept expecting the commentary to stop, and the movie to begin, but it never did. It got real old real fast. Tried fast farwarding to see if there was anything else to see, but there wasn't. I don't mind swearing or dirty jokes, when they are funny, but this was just nastiness for the sake of nastiness. Shocking yes, but funny no. After you hear the twentieth person say the same thing, it's no longer even shocking, just annoying. I wouldn't even recommend renting it. Save your money."
2,Huh?,Well! I must be terribly jaded. Or I am completely polluted by today's wayward society and it's lack of morality because I found this film.....boring. This is serious. I need to see someone about this.
3,this was ok.....,"....but I think it would have been funnier had I been drunk and with a large group of people. I think it would be a great ""social"" experience. Although, hearing Bob Saget tell his version of the joke made me want to scrub my brain with bleach - it's Bob Saget!! He shouldn't say those things! And I wish they'd given Robin Williams more time to cut loose and ad lib the way he normally does."
4,Interesting film,"This film was actually a lot funnier then most of these reviewers are giving it credit for. It takes a few minutes to get going, but once you realize the joke setup, the comedians take it so over the top you can't help but laugh, or stare slack-jawwed at your television in astonishment. I found the film to be rather intriguing and watching Bob Saggot, (Full House) give the most disturbing version of the joke was a treat in and of itself. Recommended for a rental."
1,I want my 86 minutes back,"I have a sick sense of humor and love a dirty joke, but this film is a complete waste of time and electricity....and $4.23. In my opinion this documentary is not shocking, hilarious, clever or philosophical, as some reviewers remarked. It was, well, it just is. It doesn't even merit a half of a star, let alone a whole one.We consumers were willing to pay for and watch with open mind this drivel;the joke's on us."
5,The DVD is even more fun than the movie.,The DVD is great...full of all sorts of additional stuff. the director's commentary is interesting...the added material by the comedians is great. A lot of fun.
4,What do you call yourselves?,"This is a documentary about a joke for comedians, a bunch of the funniest people in comedy tell their versions of this joke. My favorite is the Mime and the South Park Version. It's worth buying used, or renting it."
2,only so many ways,"I expect you already know about the joke at the center of this movie. That said, there are only so many things and combinations that can happen. This is fully explored by the number of comedians giving it a shot, but it still comes up a scatalogically repetitive drudge.I waited until it came up rally cheap before I bought it as a guilty pleasure. Good thing too. One watching was plenty, and I won't watch it with friends"
5,"Sick, yet incredibly captivating","A gut-buster. Caustic, vulgar, lewd, appalling but shockingly funny for a one-note riff. Standouts include Sarah Silverman and Doug Stanhope. Not for clean-cut Cosby or Seinfeld fans, but for gutter snipe. Can't recommend it enough if you're a fan of the likes of Stanhope, Bill Burr, Louis CK, Carlin or any miserable, misanthropic comic."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:There aren't many documentaries that could be considered side-splittingly funny, but the Aristocrats might just fit the bill; though it runs out of gas around halfway through and drags thereafter, it's worth looking into if you want to hear a lot of talented comedians riff off one joke."
2,Blah.,"The Aristocrats (Paul Provenza, 2005)The big secret behind the dirtiest joke ever told is this: it's not funny. Which may well be why documentarian Paul Provenza decided to spend so much of this documentary of the world's supposedly dirtiest joke on meta-- comedians talking about the joke, rather than telling it. Some of that is funny, depending on the comedian (there are some people who make a living as comics-- a very good living, probably-- and I've never been able to understand why. Quite a few of them are found here). But the joke itself and its endless variations? Nah. It makes for an interesting dissection of the world of comedians, but other than that, it's not all that hot. *"
5,Dirty language + Hilarious Comedians = Disgusting Gold,"The movie is hilarious for people who dig comedians and different comic stylings. It's racy as hell, but if you know what the movie is about beforehand, you already know it's going to involve more that your average bad language. Incredibly offensive but great for people who don't take things too seriously and know how to laugh at themselves."
1,Pure trash from beginning to end,"Somehow someone thought that making a movie that includes endless ""jokes"" about defacating, urinating, and anything repulsive was going to be funny. It's not. There is not one funny moment during this torturous, twisted waste of time. Flat out awful and insulting. Do NOT waste your money buying it or renting it. ** BnB Beatles Depot **"
1,There's this documentary movie I want to review for you....,"It's this documentary movie.It's 2 hours of comedians all telling the same joke which starts and ends the same but is very vulgar in the middle. In the middle can be any freeform vile image you can paint such as fecal antics, incest, fisting nuns, or sodomizing rabbis with christmas hams lubricated with bacon grease.The whole movie is people trying to outdo each other with their disgusting imaginations.The name of this documentary in case you want to rent it is called...The Aristocrats.Ha! Ha!Actually it was pretty boring."
1,Everyone In The Septic Tank,"Juvenile ""comedians"" of all ages doubled over in laughter at the delights of popping your septic tank cover and diving in head first--and describing the partcipants as ""aristocrats."" Extra points if they turn your stomach. Little wonder none of these ""funny men"" have much of a following. An embarrassment."
1,Worst movie I've seen,"Let me preview this by saying I see comedians every weekend and love documentaries. This is the worst of both. The joke is the most offensive one I've ever heard. How could anyone think this is funny? If you think pedophelia, incest, defecation, rape and abuse is funny, this is the movie for you. I was so excited to get this movie because of all the reviews and it was complete waste of money. Laughing at raping your seven year old daughter, or your children performing sexual acts on each other. I'm throwing it away."
1,A worthless exercise in obscenity,The proper way to get the most out of this movie is to put the disc into your player upside-down.Don't waste your time or your money.
5,see it to spite the naysayers,"This is what the First Amendment was made for. If you believe in free speech, if you are an independent thinker, if you cherish irreverence -- watch this film. It is funny. It is important. It is cheap on Amazon."
1,LAME JOKE! (The Movie).,"How many comedians it takes to tell a bad joke right?A.- None.B.- Too damn many, if you ask me.C.- Three: Richard Jeni, the mime, and the guy with the cards.D.- All of the above.Answer: D.(Bada Boom!)"
5,Spit Takes in the Popcorn,"I couldn't laugh for weeks after my friend died. I couldn't laugh for years after my mother died. But wow, I couldn't stop laughing when I saw the Aristocrats, and it felt like none of that other stuff ever happened. For once I laughed with every pore, cell, and microbe.This movie is the only one that made me want to run back out to the ticket booth and buy seats for the rest of the day...to see all the parts I couldn't hear/see when I was teary-eyed and gasping at the greatest joke-tellers of the world.I later took other friends.. from the age of 21 to 83, (yes, I love em all)..who all and I mean ALL had versions to tell me after the movie. We still do one-liners just in goofy moments. It's a classic. -- this is one of those movies that will stand the test of time.And.. as a comedienne, I couldn't have been more proud of Lisa Lampanneli's take on what comedy is!ALL stars, ALL aces...ALL worth it! I can't wait to see the DVD extras!!"
4,Gross out good old fashion family racism,This is fantastic. I love it. I makes you want to learn how to improvise on the spot and hold your laughter in when you wanna tell a joke. Hilarious. The top-notch comedians today telling a classic joke that you have to hear to believe.
1,Just a mess,"I like the connections involved, thought the idea sounded funny, went in expecting to laugh. It wasnt, I didnt. Oh, it had its moments, but dozens of people not only telling the same joke and then explaining it for 90 minutes? Mind numbingly dull and to add to the misery there were too many people involved who simply were droll regardless of what they said. Avoid it"
4,Very good Doc but beware,"I thought the movie was great, but beware there must have been a bad pressing of the DVD. I have exchanged the DVD 3 times now and each one has some distortion at the bottom of the screen beginning about 10 minutes in. The problem is identical on all three DVDs and has been consistant on 2 DVD players and my computer.I highly recommend the movie, just beware."
3,Mildly entertaining-this is a rent not buy DVD,"This DVD is probably worth renting, but not buying. I usually try to follow anything Penn and Teller do because I'm a fan of what they do. But I think this DVD is something that you will just watch once, and not enjoy again. The joke isn't even actually very funny so while there are some very funny segments (such as Sarah Silverman and Taylor Negron), the fact that the joke is such a non joke acts to detract from the overall worth of the movie."
4,Hilarious,An excelent movie that is funnier when you have more people to watch it with. One of the movies everyone should see and only half of them will love.
4,I'm embarassed by how much I laughed,Definitely worth owning. I first saw this in a SXSW screening and I laughed til I cried. I don't usually like dirty humor. It's wonderful to watch your friends faces when they see it for the first time. The editing is absolutely brilliant and you can't go wrong with such a long list of the best comedians around. I still can't get over Bob Sagat.
3,I have an act....,"As a true fan of stand-up comedy, I enjoyed seeing so many great comedians in a single documentary. With The Aristocrats, you get to watch these comedians run wild and improvise, which is really the whole point of doing this particular joke. It sets the comedian up to take the joke wherever he or she pleases. The results are very interesting.The documentary cuts from one talented comedian to the next, with each putting their own sick spin on things. I must admit, it was pretty amusing to see Bob Sagat go off on an insanely filthy rant. Even South Park's Cartman had a go at it - another highlight, in my opinion. The collection of talent giving their insight into this insider joke is quite impressive.There are bonus sketches included on the DVD. In these sketches, you get to see the full rants of selected comedians. The material can get a bit redundant after a while, but something will ultimately be said to snap things back to laughter. Worth a watch."
4,I enjoyed it,"The joke itself isn't that funny, really. But that's not the point. This is just an excuse to get a hundred comedians together to talk about comedy, using a single, famous joke (more of a shaggy dog story, really) as a jumping off point. So long as you aren't easily offended, you'll probably like this.Oh, and when Gilbert Gottfried tells it before a live audience at his (?) roast, that's funny. I don't know why, but he makes it work like I've never heard it before."
1,I kept waiting for the funny part.,"I generally enjoy a good dirty joke, and I'd heard that this movie was hilarious. I'm not easily shocked, and offensive material doesn't really bother me. The problem is that this movie simply isn't funny. Even poop jokes get old after you've heard the same one 10 times in a row. Maybe people like me ""just don't get it"" because we're not smart (or funny or creative or open-minded or edgy) enough. I say, don't waste your money, unless you have teenage boys in the house. THEY might appreciate the humor, since they're young and haven't already been overexposed to bad standup routines."
3,The Aristocrats,Seeing all these top level comedians doing their stuff is worth the DVD. The actually joke value...The Aristocrats...hmmmm? Its up to each individual.
1,Probably should have remained an inside joke,"My friend Todd told me the Aristocrats joke when I was seventeen years old. Todd wanted to be a stand-up comedian. Last I heard, Todd had been arrested for holding up a Wells Fargo truck. It was around this time Todd stopped giving advice. I'm not saying the Aristocrats joke led to the derailing of his career, but I don't think it helped. The film version didn't do much for me in the way of entertainment or education, either.I didn't laugh -- nothing ruins a joke more than having a hundred people explaining why it's funny before and after it's relayed in bits and pieces by an editor with ADD. And I didn't gain any real insight into comedy's backstage world. I just sat there staring at the screen wondering what all the fuss was about. For these reasons -- wanting humor and insight -- I enjoyed Christian Charles' ""Comedian"" much more.[...]."
3,Regions...,"nice movie...but keep in mind that Europe viewers can't watch it on their d*rn Dvd-player, because of the region lock. I had to watch it on my laptop and can watch it for 2 more times, because then my laptop locks onto the USA-DVD-region...nice..."
2,I just don't get it,"As a big fan of some off-color comics (Don Rickles, Bill Maher, George Carlin, etc.) I just didn't see this as funny. It wasn't offensive to me, and maybe that's why. Maybe I have been numbed to any 'shock value' of this movie. No shock, no humor.The best part was the DVD Extras where the comics tell some of their favorite jokes...and seeing Bob Saget curse like a sailor."
1,Not even funny!,"I looked forward to getting this for a long time, mainly to see Gilbert. It was boring and not even funny! I chuckled several times. What a waste of money!"
3,disappointing,"The Aristocrats is fairly interesting and sporadically funny, but failed to leave up to the hype, IMO. Three problems:1. Nowadays, it's hard to be shocking. As someone mentions in the film, South Park is frequently more outrageous than the Aristocrats joke is.2. The same joke becomes a bit tired after a while. There's a lot of talk about Gilbert Gottfried's legendary telling at a roast, but shown here, he sounds the same as most everyone else. Only a few more clever performers realize that Gottfired's has headed down a dead end.3. This seems to be one of those you-had-to-be-there jokes that is a lot funnier when told in a room full of only a few friends. The people on screen laugh a lot more than we do, and it often comes across as self-congrtulatory and a bit smug."
5,Unfit for adult viewing.,This movie was utterly without redeeming social importance. I did not find it morally edifying nor did I learn any valuable life lessons. This movie is unfit for adult viewing - though I suspect the immature among us may find it entertaining.
1,"If you've got half a brain, you won't last 15 minutes","Fair warning - I won't tell the joke, but I definitely will give away the premise of this movie. The joke that this movie is based upon is simple, straightforward, and dates from the days of vaudeville. In it's simplest form, it is a quick set-up, punch line, and rim-shot. The point of this documentary is that each comedian that has told it over the years has improvised their own details in the middle, and seem to have an ongoing contest to see who can make it the longest and the most disgusting. If you find bodily fluids, unnatural acts, and cursing as funny as you did when you were an adolescent, then you might actually like this movie. Otherwise, it's a huge waste of time."
1,Rent or forget it,"After all the hype, this was NOT worth even renting, never mind buying. It's the same story told over & over by different people, once told is enough to get the idea & the rest is just boring, unfortunately. I had hoped it would be different versions of the joke at least, and told in different styles, but in fact it was the exact same joke told same way, repeatedly. The only funny part was Phillis Diller. The joke itself wasn't at all funny, instead relying more on shock value for the laugh."
4,Good Idea for Discount Travel,"I originally purchased this book with the idea of traveling from Chicago to Japan to visit my sister who is teaching English in Tokyo. Ten months later and I have done a total of four trips (Japan twice, London and San Paulo, Brazil). This is the best travel secret I have found to date. Although, it takes some planning and flexibility, if you want cheap travel, this is the way to do it.I found the book was well produced and accurately researched. I have only skimmed through the other books on this subject, but I would have no problem recommending this book to anyone."
3,This can be a VERY useful book!,"When I purchased this book I knew nothing about traveling as a courier. This book explains just about everything that you need to know to get to where you need to go for so much less (I flew to London for 1/2 price). It is true that a lot of the info in the book can be found on the net, but there is also info about each individual company that I have not seen on the internet (or at least not for free). Courier companies vary widely in their practices and proedures, this is why this book is helpful. You will find a run-down of a lot of the questions that you would need to ask with answers already. Things such as ""can I check luggage?"" or ""will I accrue travel miles?"" and so many other things that can be so useful when deciding which company you should choose to contact. Knowing this information makes you a truely informed consumer and it also helps that the book is reputable (unlike so many internet sites). If you are going tofly as a courier buy this book!"
2,Homeland Security are a Joke,"Mark I. Field paints a glamorous interesiting life as a flight courier. what he didn'and couldn't account for were the morons at Homeland Security and TSA. I called 26 different companies and they were all out of business due to the moronic procedures of Homeland Security and TSA. These are the geniuses who were taking away our toenail clippers in fear we might steal a 747 with them. I haver served in security myself and it is common knowledge that a couriered set of documents is safef by far that freight stored in a warehouse for days on end,T. Tulp"
1,What a waste of time!,"This book is a waste of time for any reader. Obviously, Mark I. Field could care less about the content. Kelly Monaghan's book was much more useful."
3,Not Exactly Revolutionary,"While I will probably pick up the movie on DVD when it comes out, I wasn't too impressed after seeing it in the theater.Things I wasn't too thrilled about:- Over the top cheesy lines. Although, in a way that fits with the original series.- Same old same old of some random villain showing up trying to destroy everything. I'd really like to see one or a series of movies that break out of this old mold.- Same old same old of odd time-travel/time-space screwed up situations. Since when did Star Trek decide to start making this a requirement for new content?I remember coming out of the movie responding to someone who was asking me what I thought. I said something like the action and visual effects were really good, but it didn't really impress me in any other way. I'm part of ""The Next Generation"" (Along with DS9) group, so I prefer the ""smarter"" Star Trek that came out back then."
5,works just like new,Great sci-fi movie for crystal clear blu-ray viewing. Visual effects are great too. It helps to give a new look for a reboot State Trek movie.
5,Great U.S.S. Enterprise model included!,Definitely worth additional $$ to get the model in addition to the DVD. Lots of special features included in the DVD too.
3,Waiting for the Directors cut.,This should have been a combo directors cut and theater cut package. Considering the deleted scenes and cut story lines that tie the story together this screams for a long version. I'll be waiting for the directors cut version and pass on this thrown together thing.
5,TAKES IT IN A NEW DIRECTION,"The blockbuster hit that promises a whole trilogy. The next one is expected to come out in 2012. The nice thing is that it's a bit dumbed down so non Sci Fi types can get it (more money!) but purists of ST are going to cry foul for reasons I can't list without giving spoilers. The cast plays well off of each other, the dialogue sparkles in some places, the story is well paced and it takes the ST traditional franchise in a very different direction. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus; STORY/PLOT POINTS: B; STAR TREK THEMES: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: 12/06/2010."
1,"Total unadulterated , nonsensical garbage","Without a doubt a great looking movie and that's about its only redeeming quality.This movie probably has one of the most ridiculous plots of anything of the Star Trek franchise, either tv or movie, obviously the producers have absolutely no concept of physics or time paradox.Over use of special effects, totally pointless action sequences, incessant need to try and work everything from original Star Trek lore into a two hour movie, just jumbled things even more.If you are a die hard Trekkie, obviously this movie is a must, but if this is the future of Star Trek then the franchise really is doomed.And what's with the tattooed Romulans, why is it that every bad guy today has to have tats, bit like the 80s, when every bad guy had dangly earing and mullet.Honestly if you have the ability to go back in time and change things, why wouldn't you just prevent the future destruction of your planet, instead of destroying those responsible, 'makes no sense!"""
1,Cheap knock-off,"This single disc is extremely disappointing. The sound quality on the voice tracks is abominable. Whenever there was any action, the voices were almost overwhelmed by the music or the sound effects.This was one of these special prices Amazon is running and I don't know if that was the problem, i.e. a cheap copy. I have no idea what the two disc sets sound like. Likely better. I happened to see a bootleg copy that had better sound quality than the single disc.I can't tell you how disappointed I was. After seeing that bootleg, I was expecting something special on the one I actually bought."
1,Perhaps the Worst Movie I Have Ever seen in My Enitire Life,"I am a major Star Trek fan don't get me wrong but this movie is totally unwatchable and it is not because of the actors or the story but because of the endless lens flare and camera overlay. I have no idea what they were thinking of but they made a movie so hard on the eyes that they rendered the story meaningless with their jumpy camera work and cheap ""special effects"". There may have been a great story here but I was too distracted by the sloppy direction to pay attention to the story. I would rather watch ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" anyday than this hunk of junk movie."
3,"Parts I Loved, Parts I Hated","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSI had really hoped to see more of the Academy years with the characters we're all familiar with before having them go on a space mission. I actually liked that it wasn't a remake of the pilot episode of Star Trek. The relationship between Spock and Uhura was interesting. The tie ins such as the Kobayashi Maru test and Kirk's allergy were nice to see. The action scenes were good.Unfortunately, it fell back to the problems of other Star Trek movies. It spends too much time on a new character/s. The villain comes across as silly and ineffective as a truly threatening menace. The writers couldn't come up with better terminology for an important element of the story, calling it ""the red matter."" It seemed to be copying Star Wars in certain parts. Some scenes are hokey; some, illogical.However, if you like Star Trek, definitely rent it. It's entertaining. Then decide whether or not you'd like to own it."
2,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the new version of Star Trek with Chris Pine. Unfortunately, I received a 3 discs of old Star Trek movies that im not in to. The covers were virtually identical. So be careful if you order this."
2,"New = Old, Plot fails","This was a clever ""remake"" of the old TV series and could be the stepping stone to a new series based upon the younger version of the TV characters beloved by all us trekkies. The personalities and even mannerisms of the younger versions of all the old staples, including Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Chekov, McCoy, Scotty were spot on. The plot was a mis-mash however, unscientific and a major disappointment resulting in only 2 stars. With all the solid sci fi writers out there, why go for cheap, non-sensicalness?"
3,Not the Star Trek I remember,"I grew up watching the ORIGINAL ""Star Trek."" Though I couldn't quote by stardate, I knew the name before the initial credits. As a sci-fi movie this is good. As a pre-quel to ""Star Trek,"" it is disappointing. From the young Kirk being able to drive a stick shift car (couldn't in ""A Piece of the Action"") to the sexual attraction between Spock and Uhura, to Christopher Pike being in command of the USS Enterprise for a very short time, there are just too many inconsistencies for a true ""Trekkie"" to take this film seriously. I liked the nod to the characters, but the writers, producers, and director of this film did not respect the millions of fans of this iconic television series."
3,Remixed Star Trek,"I guess I am biased since I'm old enough to know the actors from the original as well as all the spin offs, but it was hard for me to like the characters because I'm comparing them to the originals. I felt the same about TNG when it was first on TV but they grew on me after the first 2 seasons. I'm not sure if that can happen here since they are not likely to do more then 2 more movies. Other than that the plot, acting and special effects (especially in stunning blu-ray format) are all good. So if you're new to Star Trek you'll enjoy it more then if you are a long time fan."
3,ripoff artists,"Movie is good. Do not pay over 45.00 for the special packaging. $96.00? FOR A DVD? are you KIDDING? I love Star Trek, but that is 100% markup. $150.00? Someone is being extremely greedy. If you are that willing to part with your money, forget the DVD and send me the money that you want to throw away. Amazon? Are you listening?"
4,Cool Story line and great effects,"I'm a sucker for anything that has to do with space. This was a good film not only if you're a trekky, but for the average ""JOE"" as well."
4,Finally a good Star Trek film!,How exciting for this franchise to finally have some life! I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end! Great!
5,Terrific thoughtful new film,I wish that all of the Star Trek films had been created by the same team as the writers/director of this film. Each segment was thoughtful and exciting. Vonne Barnett
5,The Best Star- trek Movie ever,"I grew up watching the Star Trek shows as a kid and Watch all the Star Trek movies. My Previous favorite was The Vogage Home. I still love that movie but this is the best Star Trek movie ever. I never was a Trekie, I just enjoyed the shows and the movies. This movie answered alot of the questions about each of the charecters and how they became who they were with humor and witt, but also stayed interesting throughout. very entertaining."
4,I was in doubt...,"I must admit I was unsure I would enjoy this outing at first...but once it became clear that this movie was done as an alternate timeline, I began really enjoying it. Spock meeting himself is priceless, the inner turmoil Spock faced as a youngster, all was true to our beloved original series. Some sequences were admittedly overstated, and the Romulans were frankly straight out of a horror movie, but I definitely liked it...the computer voice of Majel Barret/Rodenberry was a big plus factor, sadly we will hear her voice no more..."
5,Great movie,"Had this movie on DVD , wanted to upgrade to blu ray and glad we did, just can't beat the quality of blu ray for picture and sound."
5,Star Trek,Star Trek! What can I say about this movie? It's the best yet. Looks great on my plasma and runs fine in my player. When is the series based on this movie going into production?
4,Excellent prequel to a classic.,"Excellent, but I didn't quite ""Love it!"" I was glad to see Kirk as a young rouge - it added a lot to the character."
5,this IS TREK,"As a longtime Trek-watcher , i found this ""neo-Trek"" movie a GREAT addition to the family of TREK . original characters , places kept well to the series . Now the BOOK readers may have more to say , but i found this an EXCELLENT ""alternative-timeline"" story to build a TREK future on . few characters left out , but the ""flavor"" of the original accentuated some and still believable . WRECKING the beautiful corvette must be sacrilege to antique owners !! But sure opens movie with proper ""mood"" .Still ""David & Goliath"" story as well .... ""OH CRAP !! what have we gotten into ??!!"" taken a little step further ; well & GOOD .not quite a ""family"" flick , thoe . A couple scenes not for youngsters . others seem built FOR younger kiddos ; scotty's little ""helper"" certainly a cute addition .... yeah !! buy the movie and go find him/her :o)"
1,"Good movie, but spend less money, digital is no good anymore","So, I got this movie recently, paid a little extra to get the 3 disc version so that I could get the digital copy. Guess what. It's expired as of 11/27/2010. Do they say that anywhere?!?!? Nope. Will Paramount do anything about it? Nope. Now, I don't necessarily blame Amazon for this, since Paramount is knowingly allowing movies to be sold that won't work. (Paramount isn't the only crook, Warner and Sony does the same thing, apparently). Get the cheaper version, save your money.If it wasn't for my wasting my money, I would have given this more stars, but alas, that is not the case here."
2,The glare generation,"The video and audio quality are great, which makes this lens flare/glare orgy completely unwatchable. If you can tolerate the over abundance of pointless and illogical lens flare/glare then you will be fine watching this movie. All bridge scenes are likely to send anyone even remotely susceptible to flashing lights a seizure."
1,has black bars,"movie has black bars and does not fill the screenlike the movie itself just not the aspect ratio, couldn't find out if all the copies are this way"
1,lousy,"After waiting at least 3 weeks for my favorite movie I inserted the disk only to be greeted with a note saying you can't play this disk in your region. This the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. To top it off I have to pay for the return. Amazon sucks! I remain thoroughly disgusted, Vern Allred"
4,I bought it because I loved it when I saw it. No other reason really!,"Purchased because the family loved it and I loved it so I said, ""I may as well get it whilst I can. . ."" so I got it and now it is part of my collection. Maybe one day I'll share it with my stepdad who is a TREKKIE of sorts! I don't know IF or when I'll get back up to the Pacific Northwest for any great amount of time though sorry dale!"
5,Movies,I wasn't a fan of the Star Trek franchise before I saw this movie but I actually really loved it and am super excited for the second one.
1,Rubbish,J.J. Abrams took all of the humanity out of Star Trek and used the Star Trek likeness to profit off a generic sci-fi action movie.
3,"BEAM ME UP, SCOTTY!!!","First, they screw up the entire Star Trek continuity with that hideous series ""Star Trek: Enterprise vs. the Nazis"", and now this. An entirely new time-line, featuring two versions of Mr. Spock, Uhura whose name means Freedom as the younger version's secret girlfriend, and (thankfully) only one Scotty. And can't anyone stun that pesky little Russian with his annoying accent? Nero's space ship looks like a ""shadow"" vessel from Babylon 5, and Kirk being chased by two alien dinosaurs is obviously a hidden reference to Star Wars.I feel lost in space. Or was it time? BEAM ME UP, SCOTTY! LOL.Still, not entirely bad as lite late nite entertainment, so I give it threeee stars. Yepp. In the sequel: the ultimate confrontation between a very old Q, an even older Kathryn Janeway, and the Dergue...pardon, Borg...with Yoda and Narada Michael Walden waiting in the wings.No? Hey, why not????"
5,The best Star Trek ever,"Though I respect all the Star Treks movies and shows out there over the years, the stories about the original crew are my favorite for sure. And while I enjoy the early movies with that original crew, this modern take on the same characters is fantastic. All of the actors did a great job, combined with fantastic effects, and having Leonard Nimoy appear as the original Spock was icing on the cake. This disc also contains one of the funniest gag reels I have ever seen, and I still laugh about it years later. All I can say is that I am very looking forward to the next one due out in May 2013 and the fact that JJ Abrams will direct the next Star Wars movie gives me a ""new hope"" that that movie will be nothing short of spectacular also."
3,"Three star quality picture, five star quality film.","The movie is obviously five stars; the quality of picture and sound in the streaming version left a lot to be desired. The connection seems strong enough not to lose the movie part way through; therefore, it should also buffer to a higher quality picture faster than it does."
4,Fascinating,"Good condition when received, very enjoyable movie. Just like I saw it in the theater, sound is amazing and picture is great."
5,Star Trek,Pushed the wrong STAR. We love this movie. Had to get it. Have been enjoying. The DVD came unscratched and in perfect condition. Can't wait to see the next movie coming out with the same actors.
5,Star Trek,This movie was terriffic. It didn't change a thing that all the characters in the original Star Trek used to say about things they did when they were younger. It was great seeing what the Kobiashi Maru test was really about. Showing us how they made some of the scenes was very interesting but for me it took some of the magic away.
4,Great Movie,Great Movie! Classic Star Trek action! It was great how they developed the original Star Trek's characters and showed that they weren't always so buddy buddy.
3,Young Kirk and Spock,"Good actors, very good action and special effects, excellent video and audio quality of the Amazon HD copy,but a really absurd script. The whole thing doesn't make any sense, but it's fun."
5,Great Movie,"Loved it, great action, great effects, and fresh take on the Star Trek story. Chris Pine was great, and it was a great deal."
4,Good movie but doesn't compare,"I'm a fairly big Trek fan and I had my doubts about this movie. I was pleasantly surprised by the story and I feel young Spock and Bones were captured perfectly. What I didn't like about this movie was the obvious desire to seperate this movie from about 50 years of cinema and TV history. JJ Abrams beat us over the head in telling us that he's rebooting the franchise that it became exhausting. We get it! You're trying to bring in new fans! Just don't disappoint too many of the old fans in the process, which is what happened. It's an exciting and even funny movie but I'm not sure if the die-hard fans will enjoy it as much. Howver, if I can be swayed so can those who are bigger fans than I."
2,spend your money on the real deal,"i figured it would stray from gr's vision and sure enough, it did. spend your money on the original series, the original movies, or anything else roddenberry."
1,BOYCOTT THIS FRANCHISE,"It is my opinion that this is hands down, the worst trash I have every viewed in my life.It appears the current owners of this series have casually decided that the star trek franchise was somehow inadequate.In an instant the entire series has been rewritten, and for what; the sake of profits and commerce?The haphazard way in which the characters are throw together absolutely disgusts and sickens me.Clearly no thought has been given to the foundations of this franchise.To me, there is no more vivid example of greed and capitalism run amok; than this ""film"".I will never buy another star trek item of any type for so long as I live, nor will I go to see any future star trek anything.Something wondrous has been taken and turned it into a mere product exactly like all the other action/adventure garbage clogging up the theaters these days.I encourage everyone who reads this review to boycott this movie and anything to do with this franchise."
2,acceptable,I came to watch this movie with great expectation and came away with a headache. I rate this movie a 5 overall---it is no match when compared to the original--it was interesting but the actors really did not excite me---see it after you drink a six pac and smoke weed then it may make overall sense to you.
5,New Star Trek Favorite,"I thought this movie was very well done. Being a big fan of the original series since I was a kid, I thought this movie did a great job giving us a look at how it all began. Excellent affects, good script, well done cinema-photography, and great acting. This movie will NOT disappoint!"
5,Star Trek reloaded,"Must say I loved this movie from the moment the starship in the first scene turned sideways, vertigo in space. The little nods to the Original Series made it fun too. Good characters, not bad story, great effects. I didn't walk out of the theater feeling like I'd waisted a couple hours. The blooper reel on the DVD was delightful. Quinto as Spock was definitely the star of this show."
5,Great Movie,"This was an excellent movie, very well put together and they picked the PERFECT actors to play each part!!! We're all hoping they use the exact same actors for future movies!"
1,This Movie Skips,"I got as far as young Kirk finding old Spock and, from that point until the end, the movie paused and skipped constantly. Cleaning of the disc and dvd player proved futile. The only conclusion I can form is poor workmanship on someone's part. four stars for the movie itself but none for the copy I got."
4,Good Trek,"I'm not a hard core fan of ST or the genre, and would never have seen it excpet that I was on a long flight and it was available. Good action film, and exceptionally good casting of the younger versions of the classic characters. Lots of humor in the script, though nothing that takes away from the action or the ""seriousness"" of the original series. Well done and fun to watch."
2,A clunky plot overburdened with improbabilities...,"And where did they get Chekov... the School of Bad Dialect?I'm not a Trekie but have followed and enjoyed the series since the beginning. I really wanted to like this and would have overlooked a lot, but I watched with growing disappointment."
2,OH NO,THIS IS O KBUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED..IT WAS HARD SEEING SPOCK AND KIRK SO YOUNG.ILL RATE THIS AT AND E FOR EFFORT...
1,I am a huge Star Trek Fan,I am a huge Star Trek fan but I can't even stomach these actors. Makes me sick even thinking about it. An orgiginal movie with all new characters or a movie based on one of the television shows no named The Next Generation would have been awesome..
2,Defective DVD,My first purchase online of a used blue ray DVD. The soundtrack is not in sync with the video. Love the movie pretty unhappy with the quality of the DVD.
4,Let the journey begin....,"I must say, I was very impressed with this movie. The new cast did great in portraying the characters. But, when I saw Lenord Nimoy's appearance as Spock. I love it!!! I have to say without a doubt this has to be one his best preformances ever. This new Star Trek film is amazing!!!"
2,Not worth the purchase on BD.. buy the DVD instead.,"I was very disappointed to find that this movie was not a true BD title and was NOT 1080p format but was letterbox instead. Unbelievable considering that this movie was ""filmed"" a lot directly to digital and was available for viewing in IMAX theaters as well. To access the BD-Live features as well you have to logon to the BD-Live content site and have created a username/password to access. No thanks. Why release a first run top rated movie on Blu-ray and not have it be in 1080p?"
5,Star Trek lives again!,"Let me start off by saying I still watch Star Trek everyday....The ""original series"" and ""the Next Generation""....anything after that I have never watched and never will.This movie caught the true spirit of those two series perfectly. I won't go into any details because thats been done by at great length and detail by many of you already. I just want to say I loved this movie and will enjoy watching it over and over for many years to come.To bad we all grow old....I wish the original cast members could still be making the series and movies today....no one could ever replace those original actors and actresses but they sure did do a great job with picking some new ones.I can't wait for the next Star Trek movie to come out."
1,Connecting to watch!,"I would love to add a review but first I would have to see the movie I rented.After numerous attempts I receive a message that we can't connect please try later.Is this a common problem or do I need a certain systems requirements that I'm not aware of. I rent movies through youtube and have no problem watching. Please if anyone has had the same problem please let me know why it occurs and how to resolve it...Thanks, Dennis F"
5,Best Star Trek Movie To Date,This is by far the best put together Star Trek film produced so far. I hope more are made to such high quality standards.
3,Good package,I like the movie and the digital copy allowed me to see the movie on my ipod when I travel. The disc plastioc box arrived broken from the bottom side...but nothing that would compromise the integrity of the DVD...price was good!
4,movie,The person I brougfht this for is very pleased with it. He says it has a great picture and sound. Very happy with it
1,JJ Hackmier and Paramount ruin the franchise.,"This is no Gene R. story. The storyline is thin, and it throws away much of the Star Trek Cannon that has existed for decades. Why? Because Paramount hired a hack to direct and write this stuff, and the rest of the spineless Paramount parasites with no vision signed off on this film. If you are a long term Star Trek fan, you will be left asking, ""what happened""? If you have never seen a Star Trek movie, tv series, book, or recording, you may think this is good entertainment. However, the storyline is unsustainable, a very large flaw that Paramount overlooked while making this movie, and the very reasoning behind this movie will leave most Star Trek fans wondering who the heck thought this was a good idea. Bad science, poor character development, terrible scripting. Try and find the one character in this film that doesn't punch Jim Kirk in the face...."
4,Over the Top,"This film shows us how Capt. Kirk and his gang met each other and started their vogages together. I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The actions of the young Kirk are way over the top and are not realistic. Still, there is a ton of action and the villian is evil. If you are into Star Trek fan, a must have DVD."
4,fan,"Always been a Star Trek fan. Will always be a Star Trek fan. I think they are doing a great job, authentic."
5,TONS of special features!,The only reason you should buy the three disc version of this movie is for the movie extras...and I have to say it is loaded with a lot of great entertaining features. Well worth it for any Trekie! Go forth and buy.
3,It Could Be Better,"It's not that bad of a movie, good story, great effects but the actors that were picked for the famous crew of the Star Ship Enterprise could have been better selected."
5,This Star Trek Movie is the only one I like!,"I love this Star Trek movie. It has a great story line and Chris Pine does a great job as Captain James T. Kirk. Many scenes of danger, risks, the Enterprise in danger, but great for kids to watch. There is not alot of blood and gore however, that being said, I always get faint at heart when I see bugs going in ears or noses.. LOL But in all honesty this is a great movie as it explains the early days of James T. Kirk and how he became the Captain of the Enterprise. Great scenes, action, drama, and storyline. Great Job Chris Pine!"
1,Why French ?,"Be aware ! When you check the product description it shows the audio is in French and Spanish, not English ! If ths is correct I would not buy ths DVD. This should be in English audio !"
1,Christmas gift,"I bought three of these for Christmas gifts. I am not able to give a review as I did not watch the DVD. THe people who received the gifts seemed too be happy with it. Sorry I cannot give you more info.Norma BrandenburgYou want too much info on a purchase - please , I don't have the time. THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD RATE THIS ITEM PROPERLY. PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL. 703-569-5196"
1,Star Dreck,"I haven't seen one complete episode of the original show which in fact gave me the opportunity of viewing it without any influences as to how it should or shouldn't have been portrayed.Wow! What a waste of space and time. This over hyped nightmare was simply God awful. This ended up being worse than Battlefield Earth but without the Travolta. The only good thing about this flick was, that I rented it and saved monies by not buying the thing.What gives with you people that ranted and raved about how good of a film this was? Give me a break, it was terrible. Had John Travolta been given a second chance and consequently played the role of Spock, Mike Myers as Scottie and Jim Carrey playing the part of Uhura, this would have been a huge blockbuster hit."
1,Wanted My Money Back,"I went in with an open mind, but my disappointment only grew throughout the movie. This was made for people with ADD and a high tolerance for idiocy... never mind the gaping plot holes. Weak plot with weaker characters. It was ""GI Joe or Transformers in Space"". This should have had nothing to do with the original trek. A complete dishonor."
1,Not your Mother's Star Trek Either (sad to say)!,"I have to say, I wish I'd never seen this movie at all. I grew up with the original Star Trek, and when I say grew up ... I mean I watched it when it aired originally as a small girl (and again later in re-runs when I was older).The producers totally destroyed the Star Trek Cannon here ... more then once, and that's really sad.I mean even from the beginning, I could tell it was going bad when they couldn't even give us (die hard core trekkies) the little things, like when Jim Kirk was being born, to have a toddler/2 or 3 yr old boy (George Kirk Jr, Jim's older brother), running along side to the escape pods!Without George Kirk, there was no Nephew (Peter Kirk) for Jim to rescue years later.The movie itself, was forgetable, and I guess in part, because from that little bit on, the movie went downhill, and as I mentioned, made me wish I'd never seen the thing, as it went against much of what I hold dear for Star Trek."
1,Horrible and brainless,"This movie is a disaster but then again, a lot of our new movies have been disastrous lately. The plot is elementary, and I'm tired of prodigies trying to save the world. The characters are boring, typical and empty. I was still wondering what was the point of the boy trashing the car at the beginning... I mean... what was the point of all this "" my father died, I hate the world"" nonsense. Anyway, if you have a functioning brain, then I don't think this movie is for you."
2,"If it's ""Star Trek"" it MUST be wonderful!","If you crave video games and CGI's then this movie's for you. However, if you want more from script and direction then altered personalities; biker style Romulans (with dialogue to match); and leading players who look and sound like your local High School troupe, then you may find this film wanting."
3,NOT as Advertised,Advertised as 3 Discs PLUS Digital Copy. Is actually 2 Discs plus digital copy. COmplained and they sent another of THE SAME THING! What a joke.Misleading.....
1,harold and kumar go to an apple store,"good cast + no plot at all + explosion or chase scene every 5 mins = not STAR TREK but a TRANSFORMERS movie. I particularly liked the engine room scenes that were obviously filmed in a BREWERY (what's a warp drive without water pipes, square cielings, and concrete floors?), the bridge that was patterned after an Apple retail store, and the inside of the Romulan ship that was obviously a collection of scaffolding on a sound stage with spotlights on the scaffolding."
1,This Star Trek Sucked,It has none of the spirit of a Roddenberry Star Trek. You guys who like this are being fooled. This is a total piece of crap. You might as well have called it Star Trek Transformers.
2,Marginally better than V,At least it wasn't the worst Star Trek movie ever made. The characters were so unlike anything else in the Star Trek universe. And why would someone be driving a vehicle made hundreds of years before they were born?
5,Star Trek movie (new),"I absolutely LOVE this movie. I remember the original series and didn't think I would like the movie, I loved the spin-off series' and some of the older movies. They did an excellent job of making a new movie that grabs you. It stays true to the original series and yet is a new story of them getting together. A definite watch and as much as I cut back on purchasing movies I had to have this one."
4,STAR TREK: Better Than Expected,"Having missed the movie when it was at our local theater, I just hoped the film would be worth the lower than movie ticket, popcorn and a drink price of $9 that Amazon offered. To my pleasant surprise, It was one of the best STAR TREK movies I have seen. In fact, it was good enough to have an additional screening with my ""TREKKIE"" sons. They liked it even mor than I did.High points included giving Captain Kirk a less than perfect and more believable personality. The original Cpt. Kirk was just too perfect in ever situation.Low points included garbled foreign accents of some cast members. By the tim this film takes place, it would be expected for members of an academy class to all speak the same language well.A real tragedy was running a beautiful classic Corvette over a cliff. (I'll fast forward over that part in future viewings.)"
4,Not as good as I remember in the theater,"It is very kinetic in pacing, the story in retrospect is rather thin, but this is a setup movie after all. I am not a fan of the original Star Trek tv series nor a sci-fi fan per se but a Star Wars fan (Episodes IV and V really). The acting is also good. One major complaint is the lighting effects that show a cross of light in the corners of nearly every frame. Honestly it gets old really quick and nearly seizure inducing. This is definitely a good movie but not something I would watch repeatedly, more like once a year."
5,NEW Star Trek Movie a BIG HIT,I bought this for my family of Trekkies and we have enjoyed it more than once. If you love Star Trek and haven't purchased this movie yet - please do so. This is one you will want to watch over and over again. The graphics are incredible and the surround sound is to die for. Awesome movie. Awesome price PLUS Free shipping from Amazon when purchasing over $25!
4,Star Trek Blu-ray,"I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift. It was exactly what we expected! Until we tried to get the digital copy onto our computer. The code had already been ""used"" and wouldn't let us get our DC. We sent an email and got a new code and all is well. Would have been better if we could have avoided the whole issue."
4,I was never a fan of Star Trek but...,"I was never a fan of the Star Trek series -- I just never got into it. But, now that I've seen this movie, I might reconsider. The graphics were awesome and the screenplay was great. The only reason I gave this movie a 4/5 is because they're are a couple of boring parts, but they only lasted a few minutes each. I was also confused by some of the alternate reality stuff, which alters the original overarching plot of the series I suspect; why would they alter a story and characters that so many had come to love? I shouldn't say anymore for fear of ruining the plot for you. Overall though, I think the movie was very well done!"
1,worst star trek ever,"I have been a life long fan of star trek. Until now I thought the motion picture was the worst of the movies but it has been topped. This movie features mediocre acting and a plot that erases nearly 50 years of star trek history. The best part of the movie was when I fell asleep, wonderful power nap!"
1,Horrible sound and picture quality,"I ordered this online version by mistake, thinking it was a DVD. But I played it twice, and the sound quality and picture quality were so bad that I turned it off and have never played it again. I then ordered the DVD, and the movie itself is fantastic."
5,A creative take,A very creative plot line while maintaining the original flavor of Star Trek with a great plot-line. It was much better than I expected.
5,The Best Star Trek movie!!!,"This was an absolute great movie! I have never been a trekkie but have enjoyed watching the shows and movies (some of them). I am more of a Star Wars fan and I think it was better then Revenge of the Sith due to better writing and acting. With Star Wars, I grew up with EP 4-6 and those are still my favorites. This Trek movie however has made me a Trekkie geek as well. Great cast, great story (love the whole shake up of the Trek universe), and great special effects. Yeah it is a re-boot of the original series, but it is the begining we never saw and now a whole new universe! Go see and then buy the DVD when it comes out."
3,FASCINATING WITH FLAWS,"Good cast for the most part, except the one who played UHURU looked more like AHOOKER. Uhuru in the original series radiated an intelligent dignity, in this movie, you'd expect her to be transported to a Victoria's Secret show on Vulcan, after smooching with Spock. That being said, the FX are pretty good, although in some shots the Enterprise looks like the Enterprise Model Kit. The opening is a grabber, but the whole plot is pretty much figured out in the first five minutes or less--even without a 23rd century computer. Interesting that the bad guy sounds more like a biker than someone from an advanced civilization--interesting or incongruous? Flawed, but fascinating, and well worth a viewing."
2,Lousy Plot,"I was looking forward to a great update of the Star Trek story, but was greatly disappointed in this film. While the special effects, the sets and most of the actors (except for Uhura and Scotty) were well-cast for their roles, the story line was horrible. A trite good vs. evil villan (named Nero, no less), and some really improbable things that would never happen in a Star Trek story (Spock would never jettison Kirk in a space pod and strand him on an ice planet - against Starfleet regulations), makes this a real bomb. I'm a big-time Trekker and was dismayed to find such a dumb plot wrapped up in such beautiful packaging. Glad I only rented it."
5,AWESOME MOVIE. must see,Great movie. even better on blu ray. i've watched it like 5 times already :-)
3,Decent movie but it has serious flaws,"I just finished watching this movie. For a long time I have been an avid Star Trek fan and have seen all the major motion pictures. This movie is an attempt to remake the franchise for more modern action-oriented audiences. Consequently, there isn't much of a plot here. The whole notion of a rogue Romulon from the future seems entirely wasted. The script is either poorly written or poorly acted.What could have been a great movie turns out to be a mediocre one at best. Further, the actor who plays Spock (the same one who plays Sylar on Heroes) does not do a credible job. Part of this isn't the actor's fault--I just kept anticipating him to throw people across the bridge with just a gesture of his hand--but neither was he convincing in the role. The actor who played Kirk did an excellent job. Ohura was miscast.When the closing credits came, I felt that all we saw was dazzling special effects without any real or lasting substance. Poor job, J.J."
5,Superb,"Great homage to die hard Trekkies. I loved it. The older movies had the charm, but this was even better than your typical prequel."
4,a Star Trek prequel,This film is a sort of distorted prequel that has Spockand all the other major original series characters asyoung people. Captain Kirk gets his command four years early do to an Romulanattack from the future by a Captian Nero.The special effects are pretty well done andthe acting is ok for a sci fi film as well.This film really distorts the time line and history of Star Trek.
5,One of the best science fiction movies released in 2009,"- The special effects are interesting.- The character development is so good that I can't take my eyes off the screen until the end of the movie.- The action is exciting.Warning: DO NOT READ the FOLLOWING if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the MOVIE- There are quite a few touching scenes. For example, while crashing his ship to the enemy, the first captain said goodbye to his newly-born infant and his wife.The other is when the second captain could not save his mother.It's one of the best science fiction movie released in 2009. I own it.P.S On Sunday, Mar 7th, 2010, this movie received an Oscar award for Best Makeup."
5,Great movie,This movie is a great reboot of the classic series. The story is witty and inciting with an outstanding cast!
5,Boldly go!,I've been die hard a fan for as long as I can remember ~ and attend the Trek convention in Vegas every year! This movie rocks. It's a blast to watch. I loved it. Roddenberry would be proud. I spoke with his son Eugene at the con & he said he liked it too! I hope they make several more!
3,Fine but...,"kind of loud and dumb for a Star Trek movie. The cast all play their parts extremely well but the plot is a little hackneyed and I think it goes too far out of the way to please the hardcore fans by contriving alternate universes and time travel. Eric Bana's character doesn't have a rational motivation. Why not go to starfleet in the past and get them to not use the anti-matter as opposed to trying to destroy Vulcan and Earth like a crazy person? The characters run every place and scream at each other a lot and Kirk is in full-on sexual harassment mode all the time. It's definitely turned up to 11. Finally, they give no legitimate explanation how an ensign like Kirk would be knocked up several ranks to command the flagship of Starfleet- that's not how military-style ranking works for good reason. That's not to say the movie is bad- just frustrating in some ways. This one is worth picking up if you can get it at a discount."
4,Great Movie!,This is a great film and having it on Blu-Ray just makes it that much more enjoyable. I'd give it a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the digital copy only allowing you 2 copies.
3,I would have appreciated other options when ordering.,The movie was great. I didn't need all the extras. Would have liked just the movie.
3,Don't judge a DVD by it's cover,"Advertised as ""New"". Expected original packaging and in a box! Received a DVD in an open plastic envelope, that was in an open yellow paper envelope, that was in a larger plastic envelope containing both the ""new"" DVD and an outside cover. The appearance of the DVD seemed intact. It played well without scratches or smudge marks. What constitutes an item being ""New""? I contacted the seller and expressed my disappointment. He explained that's how he receives them. Did I read the fine print he asks? (supposedly it existed)apparently not. He compensated for the Shipping....I found another case for the DVD. Choose wisely!"
5,I'm Not Even a Trekkie,"This film was perfection! Well-acted, gripping, and intelligent. The best sci-fi feature in years, and the best 're-boot' period!"
1,Audio Sucks,"Ridiculous plot aside, my main gripe with this dvd is the boosted background audio. The dialog is almost entirely drowned out by explosions and ""riveting"" music; so much so that it's nearly impossible to follow the story."
1,Worst crap I have ever seen,"The plot makes no sense, it's just unlikeable characters badly acting between special effects. Nothing to do with anything that makes Star Trek great. Oh if only Roddenberry could've come up with the money to buy the rights in 1970 when Paramount offered it to him. At least he didn't live long enough to see this destruction of his life's work."
2,"It's an interesting show, but it isn't Star Trek","Sorry, but they took 43 years of history and erased it all. What they replaced it with was attractive but also one-dimensional and shallow. Star Wars was the show about action. Star Trek was the one about science and character interplay. All they did with this one was turn Star Trek into a Star Wars...and an inferior one at that. I'm giving it two stars because it was attractive and was something that maybe would have been OK as a different franchise. I took away the rest for abandoning so much history and turning something so iconic and significant into something so shallow."
2,Pale reflection of the superb original series,"The producers had a chance to capture some of the magic of the original series but--alas--they missed the boat. The appearance of Leonard Nimoy is one of the few bright spots. Spock French-kissing Uhura is undoubtedly the film's nadir; that, and the discombobulated script with its unbridled excesses and the constant cops-and-robbers-style shootouts make this movie suitable for puerile audiences and, perhaps, video game lovers."
1,Digital Copy Rip-Off,"I paid for a digital copy of this movie. The digital copy code wasn't working so I contacted Paramount at the URL given by iTunes. I just received a reply from Paramount:Thank you for your interest in Paramount Digital Copy, but unfortunately that feature offering is no longer available for Star Trek.What a rip-off. I hate paying for something and then not being able to access it."
5,Just Buy it!,"This is a great movie. I grew up with the ""Original"" Star Trek tv series and all the versions and movies that have come since. Some have been better than others, yet all have been entertaining. This latest film has great casting, a storyline that is fun and just as plausible as any that came before it. There are some great lines and plenty of action. A few times it even brought tears of joy to my eyes. Some people are just too picky, enjoy it, and remember it is just a movie."
3,"Fun, but not your father's Star Trek","Ok, the movie is fun, and it's characters are spot on for the characters we have learn to love and see from countless reruns, movie releases, and of course, DVD packages. I was slightly disappointed that Sulu's character was played by a non-Japanese. Something for the 21st Century that still amazes me, (sort of like seeing Caucasian actor's play Native-American Indians, or Jewish-White vaudevillian's putting on the dark face comedy routines...unsavory).I also couldn't understand the emotional relationship between Uhura and Spock, or the film's conclusion of Spock's mother...all which makes it disconnected from the original series and Gene Roddenberry's creation. I cannot forgive the director and screenplay writer for taking such liberties (not casting a Japanese actor to play Sulu, Spocks response to Uhura (especially the transporter scene). Overall, I give this movie a 3 because it is entertaining but not your father's Star Trek."
4,A Fresh & Different Coat of Paint,"As a follower of the original series, The Next Generation, and all of the films, this interpretation of Star Trek is a really good one. The characters are fun and not stale. The actors seem perfect for the roles that they play and the story isn't half bad. There are a few times when you want to say ""huh"", but not many. The special effects help the ""huh"" quickly disappear. Not wanting to spoil it for those considering a purchase, let me say that those who enjoy a movie with lots of action, comedy and special effects should buy this movie! It reminds me of Indiana Jones in space. Star Trek purists may find some things disagreable but that's to be expected. Chances are even the purists have seen this one and most likely purchased the movie. I own all three versions of this movie and even bought a Blu Ray player specifically for this film. Note: If Leonard Nimoy is in the movie, rest assured this Star Trek movie is a very good one."
3,I think they exaggerated !!,"Maybe is an old fan's grunt, but the changes they have made to the line of time (I won't mention which ones not to destroy the readers surprises) completely change what we know as Star Trek. I was really expecting some reversal at the end. However, let's see what new surprises the sequel will bring. Anyway, I like the new actors, the new Enterprise, and the new approach, just dislike the destruction of everything else we were used to as Star Trek fans.By the way, everything was told about the new approach enabling ""new comers"" to like Star Trek, was not true - my wife didn't like it before and doesn't like it now."
5,Star Trek Movie and bonus ship,Awesome 2 disc set with bonus Enterprise ship holds the disks in it great for die hard trekkie fan.Bought one for myself~
2,"Come on, from cadet to starship captain in one hour???","The plot is absurd. The only thing that saves this movie from a one star rating is all of the visual eye candy. Why do people think they need to take a good thing and re-write it? I'm all for a good re-make -- as long as it stays true to the story line and franchise. Come on people, how ridiculous is it for Kirk to go from cadet to captain in 60 minutes? I hope these people NEVER get to meddle with Star Trek again."
5,Star Trek,"As a Star Trek fan I was anxious to see how the producers would be able to create a beginning story for all of the characters we knew from the Star Trek TV and Movie series.This film is a fast, action packed adventure, depicting our heroes as young students entering Star Fleet Academy. We see the rebellious James T. Kirk, Mr. Spock, Leonard McCoy, Uhura, Scotty and the other future crew members of the Enterprise as they grow into their future roles as Star Fleet Officers.The story itself contains the typical villain who has been caught in a time warp and blames Spock for the loss of his family. In this movie he takes his vengeance on Spock's home planet of Vulcan by destroying it with a devastating weapon.The young trainees, under the command of Captain Pike, are sent to investigate violations of the neutral zone and are soon engaged with this mysterious villain.Fast paced action and drama are the hallmark of this great movie. If you are a Trekkie you'll love the New Star Trek film."
2,Eh.,"As a Star Trek original series fan for many years, I, too, went into this with an open mind, and must admit I thought it was, overall, fun. But where I really get hung up, and what I really cannot (will not?) accept, is the revisionist history of this ""enterprise."" Keep the action, keep the cast, keep the early years, keep the green girl, but I wish they had not decided to get into the wayback machine for a do-over. What's next, ""The Search for Spocks?"" Can't say I'll be buying this one. Maybe I'll rent it, just to give it another look."
3,Three disc but no dvd?,"Come on -- three discs should be blu-ray, DVD and then the digital copy.I'm still bummed HD-DVD lost the format war... was nice to have HD-DVD on one side of the disc, and DVD on the other so that I could watch it anywhere (my bedroom, the portable dvd player, etc). For the cost of blu-ray discs, surely they could break down and give us both the high def with the standard def in one bundle?"
1,Where's the regular DVD disc?,"Boy, just when I thought I knew how to tell one version from another, Amazon threw me a curve on this one. You'd think that having a THREE! disc set you would end up with a regular DVD copy for the other non-Blu-Ray players in the house. Not with this one. One Blu-Ray and two crap extra junk discs. I'm mad at myself for not reading closely enough but the advertising on new movies is not as straight-forward as it should be. Fool me once...."
2,Badly go...,"Excelent film.Poor Star Trek.I wish they called it diferently. Like Star Action starring super-cool people. I would not be so annoyed.What is the idea of this Star Trek. When someone tries to kill you, you should kill him first? How very startrekish."
4,Bob,I think the movie is an excellent recreation of the Star Trek series. The actors did an excellent job. I will buy more of their work if they do a follow on movie.
3,Star Trek,"Gene Roddenberry must be spinning in his grave, this movie is so far out of context with the original Star Trek its just plain wrong, the only explaination is that its an alternate universe where up is down, and an Ensign becomes Captain on his first mission. Chekov joined the crew when Kirk had been Captain for, what 15 years, but not in this upside down universe, he was already on board when Kirk came aboard. They should have just gave the ship and everyone in the movie a different name."
5,Star Trek the New Generation,"This Star Trek is the best re-adaptation of an original series to date. The selection of the new cast is incisive. The chemistry is best even surpassing the original in some instances. This is not the Star Trek of Old or the Star Trek of the Next Generation, but the Star Trek of the New Generation. Most impressive indeed. The only thing I fault the developers, investors, and the creators is that they did not plan for an immediate or mid-term (2-3 year) new show, with the exact same cast, for a new series...aka, Star Trek the New Generation. So much time has been lost...and with it, new revenue streams.This movie is awesome."
5,Good flick,Came in a nice dvd case? I'm not really sure what to say but it's a good movie with good action
5,Great Movie,"Movie is fast paced, thrilling and just totally awesome. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time. The actors, the story, the music was a blend of both Star Trek classic and the fast pace of Star wars. Great movie and enjoyed it."
2,Bad Product,I am very sorry that I didn't open the product right away to watch it. (Lesson Learned)I just tried last night and found that the movie I received was defective and it's to late now to return it for another copy - So I've wasted my money. Not a happy person here.
2,Ummm - OK,"This a prequel to all that's Star Trek.Kudos to the Casting Director. Especially for the Bones McCoy actor. He just looked, sounded and felt like the young Bones. Good acting there. If you weren't looking, you'd think it was the old Bones (DeForest Kelley). The rest of the cast did a good, workman like job.In general, the plot was interesting. However, it was presented in a contrived fashion. The insertion of ""the past"" often seemed like commercial breaks to an otherwise good story.So, I found it watchable, mildly interesting; but, I can't ever see myself watching it again."
2,Someone needs to time travel and write this movie out of existence,"I tried to give this movie an honest shot. I really did. I've watched every bit of star trek out there, and sadly, this is pandering crap made by someone who hasn't the faintest idea what Star Trek is about. Instead of thrashing decades old story lines, the director should have just come up with something original."
5,No Issues,The movie came on time (even faster than I expected) and there were no issues. Great Service! Of course the movie was awesome as well.
5,Best Star Trek Movie,Speechless... this movie was awesome... as good as the original episodes... i hope that there will be a lot more to come from this cast and production professionals... best ever!!!!... from an original 1960's treki...
5,Very Good Film,"I have seen this movie when it first came out in theaters. My wife and I enjoyed it. Can't say I grew up watching the origianl tv shows, but grew up watching The Next Generation and such forth. If you read other reviews, they complain about they missed up this and that. Whatever. Star Trek was a dying breed. Enterpriese was failing on ratings. They had to re-vamp the Star Trek franchise. One reviewer mention minor dissapointments, I agree. But the movie was not a let down. As far as the Blu Ray version, I can't comment on the pic and sound since I'm still waiting on my copy."
4,Great Reboot!,"Good character building and foundation laying without taking away form the movie. Action sequences are continuous and occur frequently. Great overall movie, even for Star Wars fans like myself!"
2,Why rewrite Star Trek history?,"Good action flick, which gets it the second star, but I reject entirely the revisionist history of Star Trek, which keeps it from getting more than two."
5,"From the first to this, what a ride","I was there when the first Stat Trek showed on TV with my kids watching intently. I've seen it as long as they have filmed it though I must say, I wasn't into changing to new Generation, DS9, etc. It took a while for me to warm up to the idea Shatner was there for only so long, and in the ensuing years I warmed to them all, but this! This took me over the edge into a whole new world I cant really describe. Im 72 and I am wowed by this film.If you dont like it you are too jaded to simply look at an awesome movie and come out renewed. All the characters, with the exception of Checkov were totally believable, Bones and Spock seemed spooned from identical replicas of the originals. How cool is that? I sure hope they bring them back for a couple more, these kids have it down to a fine science. Please see this movie, and if you dont like it, you should move from the planet."
2,Disconnected Plot,"Main plot weak and poorly edited. Several sub-plots incomplete and disconnected - have little to do with main story, therefore distracting to viewer. On the plus side, special effects commendable. Summary - Don't waste your money."
1,Too dumbed down to be a Star Trek film,"This movie is not Star Trek by any definition. Rather this film is a reflection of todays ""pop-culture"" as dumbed down as ever. Not too much thought was put into this movie as it followed a very simple and common formula for films today. Take a known brand ""Start Trek"" subtract all of the complex and intriguing script writing, add copious special effects, add a good measure of sexual scenes and then reduce the dialogue until it sounds as dumbed down as common modern American vernacular. Now blitz the media with as much hype and pomp as you can possibly conjure up. Serve while still warm to pop-culture drones and unsuspecting loyalists to a now exploited brand. Net result, make a few bucks with mixed reviews and move on to the next ""horror"" film... Your fellow nepotists at your local film factory will be satisfied regardless."
5,Excellent,"I am not surprised at some of the negative reviews. I suppose for die-hard Trekkies there are things that would upset them. However, I consider myself a moderate Trekkie and I loved this movie. The effects are awesome, the cast was great and the story was interesting. Sure, they changed the Star Trek universe time-line. They had to refresh the series. Anyone who truly knows how time-travel (in the Star Trek world) works knows this is hardly a big deal.The new Star Trek timeline opens up a new pathway for the series and makes it new and refreshing. They would hardly have done well to just remake what we've already seen.There are a few things in this new movie that bothered me, like Spock and Uhura hooking up. The other things are kind of hard to describe, but none of these things detracted (at least for me) from an exciting movie that I hope brings a whole new generation of people to a wonderful franchise as well as future awesome movies."
2,Star Trek,"I enjoyed the movie in the theatre and couldn't wait for it to show up on DVD. I ordered it pre-release so that I would have it the day of release. I am sorely disappointed in the DVD I received from Amazon. It will not play on my laptop because the code on the DVD is NOT Region 1 (US and Canada). It was supposed to be widescreen and it is letterbox to the point of almost being unable to watch because it is so small. I measured the letterbox on my 37"" LG HDTV and it was only 10 inches tall! My friends have purchased the DVD from various local retailers and that is not the case with their versions. I don't know how to go about returning this product or talking with Amazon about it. Any suggestions???"
1,"This movie is ""doo-doo""!","Let me state up front, I am a Trekkie. When I saw the movie trailer for Star Trek 2009, I could hardly wait to see it. What I expected was a good prequel--an origin story with the original crew; done in the manner of ""Batman Begins""--one of the best Batman origin stories ever. Wow, was I disappointed! The movie is NOT Star Trek in any way, shape, or form. Why destroy the Star Trek universe? Gene Roddenberry must be turning over in his grave. Save your money; don't buy the DVD."
2,"Great Movie, Bad DVD","I really liked this movie when I saw it in the theater. So I pre-ordered it. Nice price ($9.99). Howver, the quality of the DVD is horrible. It looks like it was recorded by an amateur, with glaring reflections almost obliterating some scenes. Extremely disappointing! I would have prefered to pay more and have a good quality DVD."
3,"Oh ... it's kinda, well ... cute.","But that's not a good thing. I really wanted to like this one becasue I had heard such good things about it, but I dunno. Throughout the whole movie, I felt like I was watching a bunch of kids play dress-up. When it was over, my friend turned tome and said, ""it was okay ... cute."" I don't think sci-fi should be cute. Whatever."
5,The New Star Trek,I grew up with TOS & at first I didn't like the story line. But after I finished watching it & the ending cleared up the story line. That is the New movie is a alternate time line.This could be a great series. If you're a fan of the old series & don't think you will like it go get it. You will like it.
3,Entertaining...but it's not Star Trek.,This was reasonably entertaining...but definitely not Star Trek...should have just made a new franchise rather than rehashing old characters...it's like changing Darren on Bewitched....just feels strange and fake. The sequences of Kirk as a kid were not needed and the acting in those scenes was extremely amateur. JJ Abrams should NEVER direct Star Trek...stick with Transformers because this was just Transformers with Star Trek character stand-ins.
3,Generic action movie,"As a generic action movie, this one is pretty good. Everything is fast, everything is urgent, everything blows up in spectacular detail, and bits of comedy lighten it up. It's Transformers but scoring a few points higher on the IQ scale. That said, being a little smarter than Transformers doesn't do justice to Gene Roddenberry's world. Characters are shallow and petty, action scenes are comically exaggerated, the plot is full of holes, and props are so inconsistent that it's distracting. Too often a bad character portrayal (bumbling idiot Scotty and his anthropomorphic sidekick as comic relief) or a bad prop (concrete walls in the Enterprise) jolted me out of the weak grip that the story held."
3,Meh...,"I liked it. It was more like Back to the future for me. I was not a big fan of the whole time travel idea. I was more of a what if film. If you forget ALL of the previous films or just treat it like a what if, you can enjoy the film. I enjoyed it more as an action film with a sense of humor...Kind of like Die Hard."
5,Star Trek,Excellent movie-captivating because it had a few important differences between it and the original movie. I liked the differences even tho I am a big fan of the original cast. Cast did a superb job.
5,The best Star Trek thus far!,"I've been a fan of Star Trek for a long time and remember the original series (which I still consider to be the best). This movie helps answers many of the questions I've had about the original series, and characters in general. It is very well done, and I think that all Star Trek fans will appreciate it. I'm glad I purchased it on Blu-Ray as this is something I'll watch again and again.Easily the best Star Trek movie I've seen, and the best movie I've watched in a long time."
5,Excellent!,Excellent Movie! Good start into bringing a new generation of Trekkies into the world(ie my son).
5,2nd favorite...,...item i bought on amazon this year - i love this move - saw it 3 times in the theatre - first favorite: the book Live Like A Fruit Fly - although it quotes star wars throughout the book :)
4,package labeling,"When I ordered this video I was under the impression that I was purching a dvd not a blu ray disk. I was dissappointed that the label on the order was not more clear.At present I don't own a blu ray player and it took some time before I could find one to borrow just to play this movie.On the 4 star side, the movie itself is very good. Kirk was just a arrogant as in the TV shows. The Spock character was less than Vulcan. McCoy was delightful, Checkov was comical, and Sulu...ever the swashbuckler... well, was Sulu."
4,A nice surprise,"If it weren't for my 11yo son I wouldn't have seen this movie. I wasn't looking forward to another Star Trek movie after the last few. Boy am I glad my son wanted to see it.Other than a few distractions such as Spock always looking like he was smirking this movie left me wanting MORE. After enough time to get used to the characters, even Spock about to bust into a smile was ok ;)The story is a good one on the whole. Just don't get distracted at some key points and you can follow the plot without having to rewind it to figure out what you missed lol.I am a big fan of the original series and TNG, and a few of the movies. This one is going to be right up there with my faves."
4,Great reimaging of the Star Trek story,"At first I didn't like the movie (in theatre), but then I watched it again and let go of my prejudice for the original Star Trek. The characters are all really vivid and loud and bright. This new timeline is going to be radically different, but the rich Star Trek history is still there. One of the biggest stars of this movie the USS Enterprise herself. Absolutely breathtaking in her majesty, and the chance to see the operations of the ship (engineering) and prepping for take off, etc... is cool. The bridge has to be the most awesome ever."
4,Star Trek Movie DVD 2009,"If you're a fan of the 'Star Trek' series, you'll love this movie. I was not a Trekkie, but had always wondered how Dr. McCoy got his nickname, why Spock and Kirk became such close friends, and whats the deal with Scotty. I've already lent the DVD out to friends and family as they wanted to see it as well."
5,Great movie for Star Treck fans!!!,This is an awesome movie...the special affects are great! I saw it in the theater and wanted it on DVD right away.
4,Excellent action packed movie !,This movie look exceptionally good on blu ray. the colors are vivid and bright and the sound is crisp and clear. there are over 3 hours of extra features on the second disk. there is also a demo game for star trek on the third disk. The demo game was a waste of time not worth playing. Acting was excellent and the story kept pace and didn't get boring. Tyler perry was an admiral in this movie and he made me wanna puke but he only had about 5 minutes in the film so it wasn't too bad; at least they didnt give him a starring role elese i wouldn't have bothered to buy the film. Overall the director did an excellent job on the movie and I'm waiting for star trek 2 (hopefully Tyler Perry won't be in another star trek movie)!
2,Why can't Hollywood shoot in Hi Def?,"I Purchased the BlueRay version and basically it was shot in Widescreen Mode using 2/3's of my 55"" Samsung LED LCD TV making it look like crap. It looks fine on my iPhone I Like the movie but the BlueRay Version is a waste of money."
1,"Slick, campy production but not a Star Trek movie","JJ Abrams is a good director of CGI type action movies. JJ Abrams is also a Star Wars fan as opposed to a Star Trek fan. Star Wars is futuristic fantasy. Star Trek is harder sci-fi. Hence JJ Abrams did not stay true to the Star Trek franchise & made a JJ Abrams movie with Star Trek characters. No Respect for the Star Trek fan base. No respect for the original body of work that Gene Rodenberry created.Spock is sexually active and in a relationship with a former student- not a Vulcan thing. The time line story isn't very good. The screenplay has an air of being written by 3 people- a Star Wars fan, a Teletubbie script writer, and a Lifetime Network Man-hater Movie of the Week.I lost respect for Leonard Nimoy on this one- the things actors will do for a paycheck. I'd rather see Spock team up with Ron Jeremy for Skin Trek. I get more enjoyment watching Priceline commercials with William Shatner; I find them more sincere."
4,better than i thought,"I love the origional Star Trek MOVIES with captain Kirk but hated all the others. I figured this movie would be really stupid having the young crew but surprisingly it was pretty good. The reason I gave it 4 stars was basically because of the story line . They did such a good job on the story line that they could make a whole new series and it was good to see Spock again (Nemoy). I believe there will be a sequal and I can't wait to see it . The reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is because even though it was good , it still wasn't as good as the origional movies."
2,Was this Star Trek?,"This is hard for me to write. If I watched this movie and knew nothing about Star Trek I would say it was a good movie. Having any knowledge at all and being a huge fan of the series I can no longer make that statement.Do not read more if you plan on watching this movie and do not want to know more.I did not mind the alternate time line but it was so made just to please the hollywood crowd. I have to give it a low rating. Maybe they will make a second and actually try to remember what Star Trek and the original characters were all about. Kirk was not a screw up, yes he was a young hot shot. Spock would never have had some sort of weird love relationship with Uhura. He spent his life and dedicated it to being Vulcan. Scotty was a brilliant dedicated chief engineer and not some bumbling fool that happens to also know something about star ships. Get my drift? Sorry if I spoiled the movie!"
1,Total Storyline Garbage,"I 100% agree, this movie was garbage and I am glad that I did not buy it. This movie was nothing like star trek. The writers came up with their own version of star trek that is as much like star trek as cat is to a a dog. The plot and storyline of this movie was laughable at best. They should have named it something else but not star trek. Here's one little example: kirk is put in charge of the ship's bridge and in a few short minutes goes from being a recruit to being the captain of a ship. That is absurd as captains get to be in their position after many years of military experience at a minimum of ten to twelve years on the low side. That is just a small example."
5,more MORE!!!,Best movie I have seen in YEARS!!!The fact that it is a Star Trek Movie is just icing!!!Can't wait for the MMO.I NEED my own Starship!!
3,good summer movie okay star trek movie,"A lot was good with the movie. It moved fast enough so that you didn't ask to many questions but when I got to really think about it the movie was just okay. If you got caught up in the hype about how this was the best star trek movie ever then you really didn't care about what was on the screen. I'll give you just one thing to think about. Kirk gets stranded on a planet, he gets chased by a monster, just happens to end up in a cave where older Spock is, they then go to the Federation base on the planet that just happens to have Mister Scott on it who just happens to be working on a transporter program that would allow one to beam aboard a ship in warp. Thats a lot to swallow. As I said great summer movie. Shove the popcorn down your throat, sit back, take the ride and don't think. That all being said I will probably buy the movie to add it to my collection. Of course, I'll wait until it's been put in the discount bin at Wal Mart"
1,DVD disappointment,Loved the movie but the DVD skipped all over when played. Double checked on different player and still did the same thing. But Amazon's easy return policy makes the return process a snap and I will definitely reorder from Amazon again.
4,Woo hoo!!!! Got my order in today!!!!,"This movie was great! Can't wait to get the blu-ray to watch it up close in all of it's glory. The casting was perfect and the acting was good. There'll be plenty of extras too to keep me entertained for a while as well. If you want the best Christmas gifts, you gotta get them yourself :-)"
4,"If less than I hoped for, more than I feared","Entertaining, with some great effects, and some solid acting and real heart.My only disappointment was that, as the film went on the action took over to the pointwhere the emotions got a bit lost, and the climactic battle felt a bit predictable.The action is fun, but it gets repetitive, while the human scenes retain their humorand freshness.What always made Star Trek special for me was it's emphasis on characters andintelligence first, action second. So I was sorry that ended up a bit reversed by theend here.But if it's not quite a great movie, it's certainly an enjoyable and well-made one."
2,Cheesy,"Sure do miss the originals. This starts out with loud noise, too much action and general overall chaos. By the time all this was over I was asking myself - and when do we get to the plot.Not of the quality or character of the original. We didn't like it much."
2,Wanted to like it,I really wanted to like this movie but I was disappointed. What finally got to me was all of the unlikly and unbelivable coincidences which result in J.T. Kirk being at the helm of the Enterprise.
2,Expecting better....,"I was so psyched to finally watch this movie. I guess I was just expecting to much. I thought the whole story line was ridiculous. It botherd me that the federation starships kept getting there ass handed to them..including 7 starships at once. I was hoping to see an updated version of the ""Wrath of Khan "" starship showdown. Got a lame ass ending instaed. Old spock/new spock...bleh...And jeez...couldn't they just take out the drilling machines chain with a couple of well placed photon torpedo shots???? I watched District 9 and enjoyed it much more than Star Trek..."
2,"The title is ""Star Trek"" so it MUST be wonderful!","If you like video games and CGI's this movie is a 10. However if you are greedy enough to want more from script and direction then altered personalities, biker style Romulans with dialogue to match, and key players who look and sound like your local high school troupe, you may find this wanting."
4,Good Flick,I gave this movie a four star rate because a Treky like myself I know that anyone loving Sci-fi will love it.
3,Great movie except plot,"First off, I'd like to say that I really liked this movie. The only thing keeping it from excellence was the general plot. The fact that Abrams and crew could do so much with such a weak story is testament to their talent. Dialogue, performance, characterization, score, practical and computer effects....all awesome. I just didn't find the vengeful time-traveling Romulan conflict interesting at all. I'm really looking forward to a sequel though.I went through all the special features in one sitting. Very well done."
3,Too Much Packed In,"This movie will rate 5 stars for many. It was nice to see Mr. Spock one more time. Production values are top rate but this is a very different Star Trek than what I think of as Star Trek. This is more like Buck Rodgers or Battlestar Gallactica. There is nothing much to reflect on. It is more good guy, bad guy and that makes money in Hollywood. It may make a difference if you know that, ""The Undiscovered Country - Star Trek 6 is my personal favorite Star Trek. I also did not like the first Star Trek Movie. I am still waiting one more TGN Star Trek..."
1,absolute garbage,"Just stupid from the start. Hot shot twerp Jimmy Kirk, Duh. Spock playing kissy face? Eh, this movie is so stupid it isn't even worth talking about."
4,Great fun,"I confess to enjoying this film thoroughly, even though the plot has holes big enough to drive a starship through. I rebelled initially when Romulans appeared. Romulans? Who fought a war with the Federation and who were never even seen until Original Series episode ""Balance of Terror""? However, the plot manages to sort this out.The ""Enterprise"" crew look reasonably like (and act reasonably like) younger versions of the beloved original series characters, and there are lots of affectionate nods towards the old series, including McCoy's famous ""Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a ..."". Zachary Quinto is especially effective as Spock. However, I am disappointed that there was only a slight element of the classic Spock-McCoy contretemps, and, in spite of numerous fights, Kirk failed to tear his shirt even once... Perhaps in the next film, to which I eagerly look forward."
5,Most satisfying movie of 2009!,"I wasn't what you could consider a ""Star Trek fan going into this film. I'm much more of a Star Wars guy. But J.J. Abrams and company hit this one out of the park. This movie is a good time from start to finish. There are plenty of tidbits for the hardcore fans, but the movie is extremely accesible for a newcomer. Perfect pacing, great action scenes, amazing special effects and best pf all, great writing and top notching acting by the entire cast. I'm looking forward to many more of these films, as long as they can keep all the talent that made this one possible.The Bluray itself sports a pristine transfer and plenty of great extra features (all in HD too). A must have disc."
5,"Great movie, looks fantastic in blu-ray","Great movie, looks fantastic in blu-ray, 5 stars all the way. I will watch this movie 20 more times!"
5,Is this DVD information correct?,"Is the product information on this title correct or am I reading it wrong? ""Language in French and Spanish, and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish?"" Before I pre-order, I want to make sure the spoken language on this DVD is in English!"
2,Hate it,"This is one of the best bad movies that you'll ever see.As a stand alone movie it has everything that would make a winner. The actors were good, the story was well told and the look of the movie is spectacular.As part of the Star Trek franchise, it is a disaster. Destroying the planet Vulcan? Making one of the founding members of the Federation an endangered species?NO- the producer over-reached and created something that can't stand beside the existing body of work.J.J. Abrams is great but in this case he screwed the pooch. He re-wrote history and undermined a near-sacred franchise in a way that in completely untenable. You simply CAN NOT do that with a shared treasure like Star Trek with generations of fans that know the story and trivia much better than the bleeding idiots who OKed production of this wretched script.He should have known better.Pretend that it never happened and maybe it will go away."
4,A whole New Franchise,"What a novel concept for renewing a tired franchise! Go back in time, mess it up, and start from scratch. I love the idea. However, my only fault was the emotional Spock. Fighting, marooning Kirk, his kissing Uhura.... not very Spock-like. However, with Lenord Nimoy in the movie as the adult Spock, the whole Young Spock thing could happen. It's a fun ride, and the redesign of the Enterprise is cool too. It would be fun to see this turned into a TV series."
1,For a Friend,David loved this movie in addition to his other Startrek movies. He is a huge Startrek fan so he really enjoys it. Thank you.
5,Awesome Movie,This is easily one of the best movies ever made. I love it! I don't need to say anything just see it.
5,Best Blu Ray on the market,"This is the best Blu ray on the market. Quality is amazing, content is spectacular, and the movie is great, directed by JJ Abrams (Lost) and it has many tie ins to the old shows and movies. Can't wait for the the next ones!"
4,New look at an old classic.,I loved this movie. The villian from the future changing the past allows for variance from the Star Trek mythology that so many know so well. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto do an excellent job as Kirk and Spock. All the cast worked well with one another and Eric Bana was an outstanding villian. This was a very good adventure movie and I recommend it highly. Gene Rodenberry would have loved it.
4,Permission to review? Permission granted.,"I saw this movie in theaters and i thought it was an incredable movie. The story line is good, the action is great, and the special effects are amazing. I highly recommend this movie even if your not a trecky (star treck fan). Right from the start you will love Captain Kirk. Do not rent this movie buy the movie."
5,My favorite Star Trek,"I'm not a die-hard Trekkie, but I've seen all the films. Pound for pound, this is the best. Just watch it."
4,not much for star trek but great movie!,"In all honesty ,I was never much of a star trek fan.. every once in a while I may turn it on and watch a few minutes.. but my son and hubby rented it and I sat down to a movie I shockingly enjoyed.. Graphics were nice,storyline was decent, action was good.. just a nice balanced movie.. Id think most would enjoy this film.. I did and believe me, Im suprised lol."
2,Horrible,"Kirk is marooned on Delta Vega. On his way to the Federation outpost there, a big bad snow creature attacks. As in STAR WARS, however, there's always a bigger fish, and one eats the smaller one and pursues Kirk to the only cave on the entire planet with Spock in it. It seems that no one hesitates these days to abuse the willing suspension of disbelief.The new movie has some great and not so great casting. Still, someone who is familiar with STAR TREK should have done the movies. It wasn't an issue of how close they could make it to the older series, but how much different.They should have called it SPACE DEBRIS, or better, GALAXY QUEST, PART II."
3,Good movie,"I'm a huge Star Trek fan,and this movie shows us how the Kirk and the rest of the gang met. There's plenty of action and SPVX. It's not as good a movie as my fav The Undiscovered Country which was the 6th and final movie with the original cast. Non the less I'm glad I purchased it,and as always Amazon got it to me intact and on schedule"
3,modern updates inc.,"Take this film for what it is: an US blockbuster-style action-packed special-effectorama with good-looking actors quoting a famous series of the past. It is no worse than most spin-offs from the original series that, each in their way, could not keep up with the original one.As such it works perfectly fine as many US films are known to do.Neglect the usual simplistic ethics, the trite underdog plot, the intricate but so convenient time warps, the action scenes copied and pasted from countless action movies to this replica. Doing otherwise would be highly illogical."
4,Pipes and I beams on a starship?!?,I would have given this 5 stars as I did enjoy watching it. But really?!? Pipes and I beams in a starship? Did the special effects budget run a little low or what?
5,Where are the Trailers ?,"looks like they pulled out all the stops for an ""initial"" release from Paramount---where the hell are the trailers??? Cmon why skimp????"
1,Disappointed!,"I was extremely disappointed in this movie. They justified all the completely wrong things in the movie to an alternate reality/time line. As if having one character say that justifies completely rewriting the ""history"" of Star Trek. I was not able to get connected to any of the characters. It just went on an on. Chekov didn't even show up till later in the original series. He was much younger than the rest of the characters. Did they just add him for the comic relief of his ridiculous Russian accent? Wictor, Wictor - gag! And the chase scene where a very young Kirk is racing his step dad's car is just stupid. JJ Abrams should be embarrassed. Not worth the time spent watching."
5,Blu-ray Star Trek XI (3-Disc) !,It's Star Trek. It's great! What else needs to be said?Only this... it's cheaper at wall_mart on line...Star Trek XI (3-Disc) (Blu-ray + Digital Copy) (Special Edition)(Widescreen)Release Date: 11/17/2009List Price: $39.99Our Price: $19.96You save: $20.03 (50%)Availability:Online
1,Big lame Hollywood,"The title of the review says it all. This is more mindless, trying too hard to appease the masses, exploding crap that Hollywood continues to pump out. Many people will suck it down, so there probably will be a sequel."
1,"A Great Sci-Fi Movie, But No Trek","I was really looking forward to this film, I closed my eyes during trailers so nothing would be spoiled, and I drove 2 hours to see it in a digital high def theatre.Here's the thing, this is a great sci-fi movie, but it is not Star Trek.At what point do you just admit that it's a completely different thing.The only reason they slapped the Star Trek name on this is because of the cynical knowledge that people respond to brand names.Also the movie burns like a fire work, it's great the first few viewings, but there isn't any meat to keep you coming back for multiple viewings."
1,Non Canon Movie,"This was the worst Star Trek movie ever made! Its more Fantasy than Science Fiction and completely not Canon. This movie is very low brow, geared toward the uneducated and uninformed. Fanboys and some sad Trekkies may buy this movie, but the die hard Trekkers such as myself will not walk, but Run from this movie.Blu Ray is also just a Fad so save your money!"
3,Not for English-speaking children who don't read,"This is a wonderful performance, no doubt about it...although it is abridged...for example, the Queen of the Night's first aria is skipped entirely, much of the masonic music is gone, and almost half of the performance is a series of extraneous explanations by Papageno and others of the role of the director, the nature of opera, and explication of plot. Everything is ganz auf deutsch. Kein Wort English..except as subtitles..this might be ok for kids with rapid reading skills, but it was totally lost on my 2 granddaughters, age 5 and 3. It was so disappointing for them not to understand anything that was being said...yet they responded beautifully to the music and singing. Goes to show you that for kids of all ages, nothing is really necessary beyond a fine performance of the original!!"
2,Why not be more specific?,"Why not to write two little words in product description, such a ""IN GERMAN""? Unless I'm missing something. Not everybody has the time to read other customers' reviews to figure this out. Very little music, too much talk. AND in German. Very dissapointed by the people who present the product to the public. PLEASE BE MORE SPECIFIC NEXT TIME, WON'T YOU?"
2,"Flat bottom, not round (picture doesn't match product!)","The sticky rice holder does not match the one in the picture- the picture has a conically shaped sticky rice holder, which makes it fit in any pot. The sticky rice holder I received has a flat bottom which is more shallow at the top (too shallow to fit in any pots I own). Right now, I can't make sticky rice with it (and I could if the seller sent me the steamer basket listed)."
5,just what I need,I have a basket already however I fail to heed advise saying that I should line with cheese cloth needless to say it's more then hard to clean so therefore I bought another in which I will use with the cheese cloth
2,At this PRICE! it should come with a FREE Side Of Beef!,"While I feel that this is a great grill, I also feel it is extremely over priced. Two days after purcasing this grill I went to Lowes, and subsequently Home Depot, and Builders Square. All of which have higher quality grills at a price of at least $700.00 less. These grills are of a higher quality construction, and materials. They have a higher BTU, and are made by a brand name manufacturer. Needless to say, I sent this grill packing as fast as I could!!!!!"
4,SOUSA IN STEREO,"THIS REISSUE OF A LATE 50'S RECORDING WITH THE WARNER BROTHERS MILITARYBAND CONDUCTED BY HENRY MANCINI,DOESN'T HAVE THE IMPACT OF A DIGITALRECORDING,BUT THE PLAYING IS RATHER INFECTIOUS.A SOUSA MARCH OR MILITARYMARCH SHOULD BE PLAYED BY A MILITARY BAND AND NOT A SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA.THE MUSIC AND THE PLAYING ON THIS DISC WOULD MAKE A MAN WITH AWOODEN LEG GET UP AND MARCH! IF YOU REALLY LIKE MARCHES,YOU'LL LIKE THISDISC!"
2,Not the best whale CD,"A rare misfire from the Sittelle label, as most of their nature CDs have at least some merit, this collection of whale sounds is a close-to-unlistenable mess. The recordings used here have appeared on other CDs and tapes I have heard (they are listed as copyrighted by the Marine Mammal Fund), and a lot of them are muddy sounding and flat. If you are looking for whale CDs, you'd be better off with Roger Payne's classics like ""Songs of the Humpback Whale"" or the boxed set ""The Sounds of Marine Mammals in the Wild,"" which have better sound quality."
2,Not Like the Picture!,"The picture implies that you will be getting a variety of at least 4 different folders. While I received 6 folders, there are only 2 designs. They are nice, but it wasn't at all what I was expecting. In addition, the inside pockets are a little lower than normal and I worry papers will fall out."
5,STUPID PEOPLE,"This is a great toy. the lady you dislocated her sons arm, is stupid! Why would you continually yank at your sons arm, until it was out of the socket, is beyond belief. It everyone out there, this is a great toy, and like another review said, all you have to do it release the suction before removing your arm!! if you are an idiot then Sock'em Boppers are not for you, if your not an idiot then buy this, your kids will be just fine!!!"
1,horrible,this is horrible i bought 1 for my daughter (5 years old)and it brock her friends jaw!!!! it also bopped on the 3rd day....DONT BUY THIS TOY!!!!
3,"Close call, but not like my old ""SockeM Boppers""","I have a pair of ""Sockem"" Boppers. Then I ordered a pair of these ""Socker"" Boppers. The ""SockeR"" ones are almost duplicates, except the air valves refuse to stay closed and constantly leak air, causing us to re-inflate the gloves almost non-stop. My ""Sockem"" Boppers never have this problem. Cheap knock-offs!! Try to find the old ""Sockem"" Boppers, not ""Socker"" Boppers."
3,a little disapointed,"this was the must have toy for my soon to be 4 year old son this year. in fact he only wanted this and didn't ask for any thing else. he was beside himself when he opened them Christmas morning and played with them on and off all day, now 24 hours later they already have a leak. we are very disapointed i didn't expect them to last very long, a month at best, but 1 day is a little much. i will probably replace them because he loves them so much but it's a shame they can't make them a little more durable"
2,there was a hole in this product the day it was opened,"My child had a lot of fun with this the first few days she had it, but it's appeal has worn off since that time."
2,cheap toy,I found the toy was made of cheap manafacture and broke the same day at least it should have contain a repair kit
2,"Fun, but not durable","My three year old enjoyed this toy immensely while it lasted. Unfortunately, two pairs popped within a couple of days of owning them. If they were more durable, I would have voted higher."
4,fun for the whole family,"we have had these for quite some time and after all thus time, we just now got a hole in one of them. Overall a wonderfully fun product."
3,Fun to play with.,"We love this Socker boppers. They are a lot of fun and provide a safe way to play ""rough"" without hurting. The only down side is that they de-inflate very easily. And after a few months, they don't inflate to the max due to tiny holes. I probaly won't buy them again."
2,good but not durable,everything was fine but they could not last more then a few fights...one of them popped right away and another soon followed after that one. cant use them anymore...the patch didnt work for too long after we put it on
3,Average,The stuff punctures easily and is not sturdy enough to withstand even normal handling by kids. The product needs to be a bit stronger for the price that you are paying for this patented polymer.
5,kids love it!,the kid I gave it to loved it for sure. And the older kids were using it also. A big hit at Christmas.
4,So much fun,These were so much fun. They provided the kids with something to do at family gatherings. It keeps them busy and is not something that will hurt the children and are big enough even small children can play.
1,Training Tool,The first one broke after about two weeks. The replacement tube broke after about ten days. Recommend NOT buying it. It's poorly made.
1,Don't Buy These,"I bought a medium resistance and a heavy resistance band. I broke the medium resistance band almost immediately. The tubing snapped right at the handle on one end. I threw it away and started using the heavy band. After a couple of months the tubing snapped at one end just like the first band. I tied knots in the tubing to keep it from pulling back through the handle and continued using it. A couple of weeks later the other end of the tubing broke. I tied knots in that end too. Now I have a short VERY high resistance band which is working fine so far. I am not a very strong guy, so these bands must be for real wimps. I do like the really comfortable handles."
4,useful equipment,"I have previously purchased one of these for home and wanted another to leave at work. I do wish it were longer, but if you have something to wrap it around, it works."
4,Too long,"I'm 5'2"" and I probably should have gotten a shorter one. The item itself is perfect and works just fine. I'm the one with the defect :)"
2,Defective product,"I have bought 2 of this tubes, and the same thing happened, they the handles came off, I contacted the company and they did answer the first time and sent me a replacement, but only the first time, now I wont buy this product because the company wont replace it even when they know their product is defective. Don't buy it!"
1,Valeo 4-Foot Medium Resistance Tube with Foam Handles,Terrible.. the tubing stretches out and don't return to its original resistance.I don't recommend this product at all.Valeo Resistance Tube
1,"Valeo Resistance Tube, Light","Terrible.. the tubing stretches out and don't return to its original resistance.I don't recommend this product at all.Valeo Resistance Tube, Light"
4,Fun Play,"An interesting translation of an oldie. I read it for Commedia Class, and if you are studying the Italian Stock characters, it's a pretty interesting, fun play to read."
4,Homemade Baby Food,"Homemade Baby Food gives you easy, fresh recipes to make for a baby. It gives you recipes which are healthy yet not too difficult to make, especially when you have so little time while caring for a baby."
1,Not for me!,My husband bought this book to help me out and all it did was confuse me. I really don't like the layout at all. I wouldn't recommend this for a first time parent. It has allergy-pron foods listed for babies before one year of age. I would go so far as to say this book is unsafe. I'm actually thinking of telling my husband to return it.
1,poorly written and of little use,"There are many books out there that are better than this one. Don't waste your money! This book has recipes in it that suggest you boil 2 cups of breast milk for a soup recipe - now who out there who wants to make their own baby food thinks its a good idea to boil 2 cups of liquid gold? There are numerous nutritional blunders like this one, so definitely skip this book. If I still had my receipt I'd return it!"
1,Do not trust this book,"Do not buy this book! There are many recipes that introduce foods in too early compared to the information in other baby cook books. I was shocked to see recipes which included eggs and yogurt for four month olds! (both of which should not be introduced until after six months) Check out ""The Healthy Baby Meal PLanner"" or ""First Foods"" they are much easier to read and in my opinion safer choices."
2,Not worth the money,"This book sounds great from the title, but when you read it you find that you don't learn anything you didn't already know. The information is superficial and poorly organized and the recipes are repetitive and not worth the print (see reviewer's example above). If you are planning to buy this book, think again."
1,Cant get more boring than this,I read a single pebble as a part of my nineth grade reading standards. I found this book quite boring along with pointless. If I had the choice I would not have chosen this even as a free choice book. I don't recomend this to ANYONE!
4,My cardiologist recomended this book,My cardiologist recommended this book and said that it was his favorite. I enjoyed it and hated to see it end.
4,"+1/2. Top-notch, no-nonsense bluegrass fiddling","A welcome reissue of one of the great bluegrass instrumental albums of all time... This 1976 classic features the venerable fiddler Kenny Baker, a longtime pal of Bill Monroe's, backed up by a small set of superpickers able to follow his lead on these ingenious tunes. Baker's sense of melody and sweetness as saws around the beats on these tunes is really remarkable -- few fiddlers can sound so old-fashioned and yet so fluid and inventive at the same time. This is some real pretty playing... Highly recommended!"
4,Relief At Last!,"As someone who at one time used scents to help celebrate the joy of life, then was attacked by extreme environmental sensitivities, this book has been an eye-opener. I am in the process of making my own products for my pleasure and value the support this book has provided. In addition to containing none of the items that set off my respiratory problems, the products I make are unique, contain no unnatural preservatives and are less expensive than anything I have found on the commercial market."
3,Good for a new fan,Dosent cover there whole carrer mostly there radio hits. But overall its good for someone who is new to the Scorpions.20 centurymasters mostly covers radio hits. But for newbies only.
1,"Hilarious, funniest CD ever !!!!!","From the juxtaposition in the title of ""20th Century Masters"" with ""Best of Scorpions"" , through each of the songs the laughs never end.This is a perfect CD. If you are Beavis or Butthead you can rock out, if you have a brain you can laugh your a*s off at the indescribable suckitude of Scorpions.Seriously though, I expected more from this CD given Germany's long history of extraordinary pop music."
2,It's just lacking in material,"I really do not like the 20th century Masters line up of discs that try to cover all of the ""Best&Greatest"" songs from various bands. The problem is that 10 tracks hardly constitutes enough coverage to do a group justice.And here for the Scorpions, one of my favorite bands, this horrible series rears it's horrendus,ugly head.Now it does have some of the Scorps best songs that you might of heard on the radio like ""Rock you like a Hurricane"" ""Still Loving You"" ""big city Nights"" ""Winds of Change"" ""No One Like You"" ect, but i just cant imagine a Scorpions song collection with out ""Blackout"" ""Love Drive"" ""Passion Rules the Game"" ""Now!"" ""Lady Star Light"" ect. There are just better collections out there."
3,Not Bad,"This is the first Scorpions CD i bought just to fill my collection, and it covers most of their hits."
2,buyer beware,"I love Placebo, they are one of my favorite bands. There are two problems with this book. It is not well written, and there just isn't that much information for the money. Of the book's 88 pages, only pages 9-65 are part of the biography. There are 18 chapters in these 57 pages, often 2 pages in the book contain only one page of writing. The whole book reads like it was written as a college project last minute. Definitely not nearly as captivating as many other rock biographies I have read. Great band, bad book."
3,The Topic of My Composition Is....,"Yuck! I bought this book primarily to learn more about the frontman of one of my favorite bands, Placebo. While our hero, Brian Molko, is obviously fascinating ""Bruised and Broken"" is a real let-down and certainly not doing him or the reader justice! The prose and grammatical structure contained in this book is truly poor writing. Didn't anyone proofread the manuscript before sending it to print?! I expected a deeper, more captivating and more meaningful insight given the subject; reading this is like reading a fifth-grader's (that's age 10 to 11 years old) composition about Brian Molko. I waited three months to receive this book and spent $15.00 for 65 pages of drab expression - the book actually contains 88 pages but pages 69 to 88 are quotes from Brian and the Placebo's discography. Save your money; just peruse Bravo Magazine or the band's website if you want to learn more about Placebo."
4,Interesting....,"I'm a recent Placebo fan so I found this book very interesting in displaying the information surrounding the band's lead singer. I found the book to be rather coherent. I also liked the section with the Cult Molko Quotes because they were really funny. I recomend the book, especially if you're a fan."
4,Well it figures,"Placebo may not be one of the hottest bands in America, but they have built quite a fan base in Europe, and why not with rocks most effeminate lead singer. Brian Molko has lead an interesting life and many things the general public think about him are cracked by friends and teachers of this strange man."
2,Try cloth/cotton training pants instead,I got these for my daughter when she was about 20 months old. I had been putting her in the potty for a while and she was kind of potty trained for the big job but not for the small one. I got this thinking this would do the trick.... it would make her feel wet and she would tell me. So far that hasn't happened. Maybe this doesnt feel as dry as an ordinary diaper but it still a diaper... she doesn't feel wet and it hasnt helped with potty training at all. It makes more sense to try Gerber/Luvable training pants (thick cotton panties)...your child will feel the wetness and its cheaper
1,These caused my daughter to have a diaper rash,"just so you know (i didn't) these are scented and my 2 y/o daughter who normally does NOT have sensitive skin had a bad rash after using these. i know it was the diapers because i went back to her normal cloth diapers, the rash went away then i tried these again and the rash came back."
4,pampers,"have used this product since over a month, comparing to easy up from pampers, i liked this one better, better absorbing, and haven't had any leaks, just it tears easily on the sides, and a solution for that is just pull it up carefuly, other than that i'm really happy with pampers feel n learn training pants."
3,Textbooks are difficult to read on the Kindle,"I bought this for my son. He's been able to use it, but it is hard to use on the Kindle as a reference like you would a regular text book. He's been able to read the book, but if he wants to work on any of the projects or flip back to a section to review, it is more difficult. The information in the book is useful."
1,Not durable at all,"My son received this as a birthday present and was so excited to use it...he loves baseball. We put it together and on his second ""pitch"" using the Tee stand, the stand broke. It has a great concept of attaching the ball to the base with the rope but when a 4 yr old can break the stand by simply swinging, it's not made very sturdy."
2,Broke the first week,I purchased this for my Grandson. We set it up and he hit the stick when he was batting and it broke. Game over!
2,Not too happy with this one,"The first time my three year old swung and missed the ball, the stand went flying from the base, breaking the connecting piece. Had to heavy duty glue it together, making it not so portable, so he could use it. Other than that, it's great."
1,Fragile,My 3 year old grand-daughter broke this the first day using a plastic wiffle ball bat. Very overpriced for poor quality.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this T-Ball set for my 7 and 4 years old. The third swing broke the stand in half. My four year old was using a soft bat, nothing that should have caused that kind of damage. We had to duct tape it together in order to continue playing. The bases are nothing more than a lightweight piece of foam. Not worth the money! Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed in this product and promptly returned it. Do not waste your time and money on this item."
1,Should be 1/2 star only,I would rate this product at less than one star. I was highly disappointed in this product. The bat that comes with it is large and clumsy not suited for small hands. The Tee does not attach to the stand very well and once you get it to stay a three year old can break it and make it non functional. You would be better off purchasing a small Tee ball bat and ball and making a stand from PVC pipe.
1,boring,DO NOT GET THIS TOY it is the worst excuse for a humanoid robot and only walks around then falls down before you know it. Get the real robosapien v2 it is alot better.
1,Same as all the other Minis...,DONT GET IT! Be patiant my young padawan learner. Wait for the REAL V2! THe mini....it just....walks....and stuff...Hmmm...Sounds...like fun...
4,its only a toy,"its not gunna be like an android from star trek or anything. stupid idiots ""it only walks""!!! well it was 10-15 bucks i meen come on dont be such an idiot. its not the best but it works"
5,Outdoor cooking at it's best!!,"I have owned many grills over the years but the Weber Summit Silver A is the epitome of outdoor cooking. I have cooked entire meals on mine, including bread and dessert, and with the precise temperature control to the ease of cleanup and exquisite looks, you couldn't get anything better for the money. I would recommend this grill, and have, to anybody who is tired or buying cheaper grills that fall apart in a year or two and are virtual infernos on wheels. This is an outdoor cooking experience you don't want to miss!!"
2,Only if your over 80,"If you are over 80 and prefer the large type Readers digest, this is the book for you. Really nothing new or informative in this book for a young person or family looking to move and work in hawaii. The Polancy book was more informative for someone more interested in getting a job versus finding a hospice."
2,Nope,"Nothing can match the book. It's long, it has a lot of exposition, however, it's Dostoyevsky! Don't miss the experience."
2,Truly Great Book deserves a Great Movie,"I just finished re-reading the book; it is a masterpiece. I wish I could say the same for the BBC series. For one, the musical score is either absent or irritating. So much of what is compeling in the book goes on inside of the Characters. How about voice-overs or something else (music?)? Let the audience in on the torment and conflict of Raskolnikov (the main character) and interplay of the characters that is so powerful in the book. What I saw was an acceptable theatrical production on film. I've written much more but it's unfortunately been truncated. Simply read the book instead or view this and know that this pales before the book. This is a dreary protrayal."
1,Worst of the Worst,"The acting is awful, the scenery offers nothing and it drags and drags so that I wound up just shutting it down and preparing it for an EBay sale. Save your money on this one."
4,Wonderful dramatisation of Dostoyevsky's novel,This BBC production of Crime and Punishment (featuring John Hurt) is simply extraordinary. Presented the details with all the gripping tensions of the original text. Any fan of Dostoyevsky will love it.
3,good if you have prior experience with the I Ching,The title should be How to use the I Ching if you have experience with the I Ching. It is a nice book if you use it as a supplement to other books. There are much better books than this one if you want an easy to use guide to the I Ching.
4,Thorough but somewhat dry,"A very well-researched book, it made for a good read just due to the obscure nature of the subject, but i think it would seem cumbersome to someone who hasn't read much about occultism and late eighteenth-early nineteenth century Germany and Austria."
5,the most complete book about Nazi-occult,"Thanx to the autor,the book is brilliant.A meticolous and perfect reconstruction of the most important peoples,organizations and societies.A very good study about Guido von List,Jrg Lanz von Liebenfels,Rudolf von Sebottendorf,Karl Maria Wiligut and the Germanenorden,the Ordo Novi Templi,the Thule Gesellschaft,the SS mystic castle Wewelsburg.Only for scholars and truly interested and involved people.Not stupid,idiot,ignorant people.Only for the Elite."
5,Excellent presentation & documentation; a classic!,"Folks who think that Nazism isn't all that bad would *hate* this book. Dr. Goodrick-Clarke has documented, with impressive comprehensiveness, aspects of the origins of the occult sections of Nazism from Ariosophy, Guido List, and other sources. He has gone back to original, primary sources (some of which are hard to get), and this research is impeccable. If one also reads ""Unholy Alliance"" (Levander), ""Die Runenkunde im Dritten Reich"" (Hunger), ""Schwarze Fahnen, Runenzeichen"" (WeiBmann), you'll see that this book is a first-class survey of the subject at hand. A ""must read"" for anyone interested in the occult aspects of Nazism!"
4,No hype -- the real facts of Nazi-Occult connections,"There are a surprising number of books that supposedly link Nazism to the occult, or to paganism, or to satanism, and on and on. Most such books are sensationalist trash. Many writers take a few known connections and pad them into book-length drivel with lots of illustrations. Others rely on innuendo and guilt by association. This writer, however, takes the trouble to seriously delve into the belief systems of these groups and carefully analyze not only their philosophical linkages but also the overlap of memberships. Anyone who wants to seriously learn about the esoteric philosophies that lay beneath Hitlerism should read this book. It is often dry and academic, but it also avoids sensationalism."
4,Early Angelina really strutting her stuff,"If you're a fan of Ms. Jolie, buy this and enjoy her in it. She plays a 20 year old vamp who seduces Danny Aiello in a flagrant, delicious way that only Angelina could. If you don't feel a sudden intake of breath when she struts into the diner early in the movie, then you need to switch back to Regis and Kelly. Angelina's not a major character, but she's on screen enough for me to feel fine about my mini-buck investment. The movie itself is a bizarre little noir that has it's moments (decent acting, OK script, good desert atmosphere) and its non-moments (uneven directing, plot holes), but not bad. The movie rates a 3, Angelina rates a 5, you do the math."
2,Wet Noodle...,"This movie drove me crazy it was so bad. I literally wanted to bleach my eyeballs out after sitting through it. The best part of this movie was Angelina Jolie - end of story. She steals the screen in anything she does, but even she couldn't save this steaming piece of crap. The plot is inexorably stupid. I guess if you're a diehard AJ fan and feel like seeing some of her earlier work, you might only be slightly homicidal after seeing it."
3,Mojave Moon,"This movie was light entertainment but nothing to rave about,will like though if you are an Anjelina Jolie fan."
3,hmmmmmmmm...,"A little on the, say, bizzare side- but then again isn't everything if you look close enough? Watch it. Angelina is always entertaining."
2,Huzzah for Angelina Jolie!,"I rented this movie for the sheer fact that Angelina Jolie was in it. THIS MOVIE SUCKS. I'm sorry for the vulgarity or bluntness of the comment, but that is my opinion, which is the encompassing purpose of these reviews. The movie was a terrible attempt at hitting into the challenging action/comedy genre, a feat only acheived by some, and mostly entirely missed by others. Now is when the reader may ask, why then does the reviewer give it TWO stars? Why not one? Why review at all? The answer to this can be explained in two words, which then, through the transitive property in mathematics, would be the basic equivalent to two stars: Angelina Jolie. The 15 minute scene stealer stole the whole movie. Though this is most likely one of the worst movies in her career, she brightened the dim mark with her natural acting and raw ability to master the screen."
2,Do you love Angelina? or not?,"I absolutely love Angelina Jolie, so of course I will sit and watch anything if it means looking at her for two hours. I own this video and I do watch it, but not because its a great film. If you are looking to find a Good movie to watch then keep looking. If you are an Anjelina fan, then you probably allready own it anyway."
2,Bad story,"I bought this movie cause I'm a big fan of Angelina and it had to be part of my collection, but the truth is that if you're not such a fan of her you'll be wasting your time. The movie it's pretty bad, it doesnt make much scence. The performances are not that bad, but the story its bad."
4,Mojave Moon,"This movie is good for no other reason than Angelina Jolie, but DannyAiello was also good. The confusion of the start of the movie was neveranswered completely until the end. Good directing and script. The desertbrought back memior's of when I was stationed at Barstow, good shots."
3,silly but fun early Angelina Jolie film,"A silly romantic comedy about the strange patterns we all blame on the moon. Angelina Jolie is cute in her role as a wayward child hitching a ride from a much older man (Danny Aiello). Peter MacNicol's cameo is over-the-top hilarity that's worth watching the whole movie for. Overall, ""Mojave Moon"" is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, nor should it."
1,Crappy movie. Nice knockers.,It's as if Sherwood Schwartz tried to make a David Lynch film.Lame script. No atmosphere. Bad acting.Nice knockers though.Get 'Wild at Heart' instead.
2,Danny Aiello & Ann Archer. What were you both thinking??,"I give this movie 2 stars because of the actress and actor. Otherwise, crapy movie. I loved the song by Sharee Ford Payne ""Stay Awhile"". I have been hunting it down ever since. With no luck."
2,Beware of positive reviews,"Shoddy fiction, stories written in first person, present tense, none the least bit erotic. Written just for him, primarily by her, from you know who's viewpoint. No variation in tone, each story reads like the one you just finished, assuming you forced yourself to read more than two paragraphs. Few writers successfully pull of writing a book of erotic stories, certainly not the ones who attempted His. A male reader's time would be better spent reading, or re-reading, the classics of the genre -- The Pearl, My Secret Life, A Man with a Maid, My Life and Loves (Frank Harris). And anything by Anais Nin (Delta of Venus, Little Birds). Opus Pistorum (aka Under the Roofs of Paris) by Henry Miller is about as hot, and off track, as male fiction gets. His -- 30 Erotic Stories -- is as short on imagination as heat. Look elsewhere if you're into erotica, or think you might be."
1,Don't waste your time,Guys typically don't like to read erotic books. I do like the Anne Rice Sleeping beauty book but that's a bit different. The stories are pretty much the same for each one. They mainly talk about having sex with strangers in a way that would never happen. Sure it's fantasy but make it somewhat believable. You want to impress your man? Show up to his place wearing a trenchcoat and nothing else. Ravage him and he will remember that more then some story in a book. Just make sure he doesn't have company over or something or that would be a moment you both will not forget.
1,Uhhhhhh!,I couldn't get into this book at all... I read the first two stories and didn't even get excited like I should have. I couldn't follow it!
2,the deconstruction of radclyffe hall,"the major players in this book were so thougoughly unlikeable that it flavored [negatively] nearly every page. Author goes into exhaustive detail about the minutea of these womens' lives. The greater part of the book was taken up with Hall's youth, Una Lady troubridge and a russian nurse; , of whom she was embarrasingly enamoured. If prospective readers enjoy tortured prose,a woman of some talent but a larger ego,and a great deal of egomaniacal self justification you are going to love this book!"
3,Anticlimatic,"This is the sixth and final installment of Lustbader's saga of Nick Linnear. On the plus side it does clear up all the loose ends that were left hanging in the previous five volumes. However the main problem is the final battle scene. After five books, each over 500 pages long, the final battle between Nick and his ultimate antagonist only last a page and a half! I felt that Lustbader was working his way up to a real no holds barred fight but just sort of sizzled in the end. An overall great series and overall a good ending if you discount the brevity of the final fight."
5,Conclusion of the Linnear Yakusa/Mafia Trilogy,"SECOND SKIN is simply thrilling. I raced through the last 200 pages, almost breathless. Lustbader keeps four or five very suspenseful storylines afloat with the frenzied deft of a juggler; my favorite being the mother's attempts to save her teenaged daughter, a plucky heroine in her own right when it comes to playing gangsters off one another. SECOND SKIN is easily the best of the trilogy started in THE KAISHO and continued in FLOATING CITY. I read the three as one long book and found myself endlessly fascinated with the interlocking character relationships and their attendant complications. Lustbader is a pro, with Linnear and Croaker being his best literary creations."
5,Excellant Series Final,"This fourth in the Nicholas Linnear series is excellant. Probably the last, BUT....... Lustbader exceeds expections in this taught thriller."
1,"Grab a burger at the local fast food, money better spent.","Absolutely one of the WORST Books I've ever had the displeasure of reading. Kept plugging away at it in hopes that something would change.... ANYTHING!!! What A Crock...... A little Sci-Fi never hurt anyone, a little supernatural can be tolerated but this thing is a mass of Kung Fu, ESP, and Ghostbusters all wrapped up in one...."
3,good collar but with one exception,"we recently had our bulldog castrated and he was looking a bit down in the dumps, so I decided to make him feel a bit more manly by getting him a spiked collar, it looks cool, has a sturdy build quality and it is definitely a quality item. The problem with the item is when the dog comes close to you, the collar, beiong spiked, quite easilyt causes pain if the dog rubs against your leg, or worse, comes to sit beside you on a chair/sofa.Great item if you dont mind the odd stabbing pain from the spikes poking you...."
4,looked great -- didn't completely survive sibling,"Great collar. Looks awesome, wears well, but ""sister"" liked to chew on the end during play and eventually the clasp/buckle loosened and gave out. We chose the spiked collar to perhaps discourage ""sis"" from chewing up ""brother's"" collar....she definitely did not chew up the spiked portion."
5,Unbelieveably inexpenive leather dog collar,"Low cost, high quality spiked leather dog collar. Great price, great quality."
1,This book is totally dated - it will not help!,I just took the Praxis and had studied this book from cover to cover. It is consists of sample tests with questions. The problem is this book is completely dated not one question on the test was close to any in this book. this book tells you to put an infant to sleep on its' stomach. This book was such a waste of my time and money. Trust me on this!
3,Like a book of paper doll cutouts,"The book is filled with illustrations which are very nice, but I wasn't too impressed. Had I not bought it through Amazon, and was able to flip through it beforehand, I probably would not have bought it. Still, it looks pretty good on a coffee table."
3,Microsoft streets and trips 2008,"The only problem I have is that no where in the instructions does it tell you how to connect the GPS to your laptop computer. The ""memory stick"" as I thought it was (looked like one anyway) didn't fit into anything but the computer. I read where it said you could ""go Wirless"" and thought that the ""memory stick"" was how it was done. By accedent I learned that on the OTHER end there was ALSO a cap that covered the part that connected to the GPS. I almost broke open the plastic to get to the GPS to connect it to my computer. I called Microsoft Help on the phone. They said that I ws not the first with this problem. at least 14 other folks called with the same issue. I hope this helps other in the future. JW in Ohio"
2,Not worth the upgrade,"I bought this program to get the latest maps and updated places like hotels. It is my 4th upgrade over the years, starting back in 2003.As far as I can tell, this version has NO IMPROVEMENTS AT ALL over my 2006 version, is more difficult to install and it tried to attach a Microsoft ""live search"" toolbar and default home page to my system. I live in western Pennsylvania and the new Mon-Valley expressway (PA-576) and several other new tollroads open since July of 2006 do not show up on the map! What is the purpose of buying the new version if there are no real improvements? On the plus side, the new GPS unit design may be a little easier to deal with, but if you already have T&S; with GPS, don't waste your money on this version."
2,Jury is still out on this one,"I am a directionaly challenged Realtor, so I thought this product might help. Pros: its cheap and works relatively well once you have played around with it. GPS receiver does have some lag-time to the screen so you need to know a little about where you are going before missing turns.I bought an inverter for extra juice to extend the battery life of the laptop and have a well lit screen. A CD player/cassette converter can put the laptop sound into your car stereo for extra loud voice directions over loud, obnoxious clients. Cons: not intuitive, a regular GPS is so much simpler."
3,"Not many new features in this version, but Streets & Trips product line is good","As far as the features are concerned, this version is not much different from the previous one. I assume the GPS and data are latest. I have the previous version of the software and disappointed to see that the new one is not much different; in that respect this version is a shame for Microsoft. If the OS is Vista, it makes sense to use the latest software.I used other mapping systems. I like Streets & Trips because of it's simplicity and ease of use. This product is great to get a clear understanding of a place and adding information to the map. For example, adding the details like rent and distance of apartments in a neighborhood and analyzing which one is best.Using this product as a laptop based navigation system (as a replacement of Vehicle GPS Navigator) is ineffective, unsafe and waste of time and money."
2,Get 2007 Edition instead,"This is no better than the 2007 Version, just adds activation scheme. I like one on my desktop and laptop, you can't do that with this version."
3,streets & maps 2007,NOT as good as 2003 edition. Campgrounds are not in it. Cannot use GPS for finding a co-ordinate. Old edition better. Pretty much works the same without as many sites of interest and addresses show in wrong place.WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT!
1,Problem with Pharos driver - don't buy 2008 (old version),"Had a problem with this product. The software is fine, the problem is with the hardware.Make sure you get the latest diver for Pharos GPS device, the old one does not work well.I had to Microsoft tech support help me get the stuff fixed.Also, the 2008 version is not very up to date and because you are buying the 2008 version in 2010 you will not get any software updates.Overall, buy the 2010 not the 2008."
2,ugh.,"The information support on Microsoft's webstie is severely lacking. Updating the software does not seem to be possible...even when brand-new. And since we had a new tollway extension in '07, it would have been nice to have that ON the '08 S&T--or; at least updatable.I've only tried the GPS once (when in Ft. Lauderdale), and it didn't work. Would try it again, but I got a Navagon for Fathers' Day...so I don't need it.I like the concept of trip optimization. However, it still needs some work."
4,Microsoft Streets and Trips 2008 with GPS [OLD VERSION],Bought it when it was the new version. Great GPS for my laptop. Only bad this is that you can't upgrade once you have it. I have to buy the 2009 version vs just paying for a software update. Poor planning on Microsoft's part.
5,Mr. Deeds,"Adam Sandler plays a small town guy that inheritsbillions of dollars. He falls in love with the womanthat is secretly using him to get the ""dirt"" on himfor the celebrity gossip magazine that she works for.She ends up actually falling in love with him, but hefinds out that she is using him before she could tellhim the truth about herself."
1,"Boring, Stupid, Predictable",I usually find Adam Sandler's movies to be entertaining and amusing. It was hard to even finish watching this one. One star.
2,Not His Best,"This movie is one of Adam Sandler's worst movies. The warmheartedness that is usually present in his other offerings is completely missing in this outing. This is probably due to the fact that there is absolutely no chemistry between Sandler and Winona Ryder. Winona just doesn't come off as being interested in Sandler. Without the romance which is the key to his movies, this one falls completely flat. All of the characters seem to be reading their lines off of cue cards. Ther performances are really that stiff. The only thing that saves this one from going into the garbage can is one very hilarious scene in which Sandler rescues some cats from a burning apartment building, but one scene can't save a movie."
1,Predictable and Boring.,"Billy Madison was great. Happy Gilmore was hillarious. This movie was simply made to make money for producers and such. It has a factory made movie feel to it. Lets have Adam tackle a guy and beat him up again, thats funny right?..."
1,godawful,lame jokes and no laughs make a godawful comedy. if you think this is funny rent Cradle 2 The Grave. one of Sandler's worst
3,Very Average,"The movie is fine if you want to waste a couple of hours, but it cannot be called good or great. It's filled with chuckles rather than laughs, so you will neither love it nor be totally disappointed.Deeds (Sandler) inherits $40 billion in company stocks from his uncle. An evil friend of the uncle wants to make profits off of the stocks, and so tries to buy them from Sandler. The ending is not what you would expect, but it's not funny or intelligent or surprising either.The whole movie is so-so."
2,Not Sandler's worst but still awfully stupid,"This movie is just a hack job; a bunch of well-known actors & actresses going through the motions to collect a paycheck. Of course, who can blame them? They were handed a hack script that was just paint by the numbers --- introduce your good guys & your villains, and then the characters with mixed a agenda, but who have a change of heart at the end. Make sure the bad guys and the stuffed shirts get their comeuppance, blah blah blah.This movie was dull and predictable, and just not funny AT ALL. A movie where a man smashing another man's frostbitten foot with a fire poker passes for humor is just simply wretched fare. I couldn't get it out of the VCR fast enough.That having been said --- unfortunately --- this is far from Sandler's worst work, and as such, deserves a second star for the (cough) lofty heights it has reached."
2,An off-film for Sandler,"This film looked promising in the ads, and since I am such a huge Sandler fan, I had to rent it. The film tries to be sentimental while retaining its lowbrow credibility; it fails. Plus even if it were pulled off, who wants to see an Adam Sandler movie with motional stuff? Not me. The film is very loosely based on ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,"" the Frank Capra classic. I haven't seen that one, but looking at this film, one wonders what the point was in re-making it. Terrible."
1,Boring!,"Come on now. There are a few parts in this movie that did make me laugh, but Adam Sandler himself did not have one funny line through this whole movie. Pretty much, a small town guy named Longfellow Deeds inherits 40 billion dollars from his dead uncle who owned a radio empire. An undercover reporter tries to get information from him and gets it, then Deeds finds out shes a reporter. In the end she feels guilty and they end up together. Its just so boring and stupid."
1,Move on.,"Originally a movie made in 1936 about a Tuba Player from Vermont who went to the big city. It later became a television show in 1969 till 1970... and then in 2002 it was turned into a travesty by the worlds worst comedian Adam Sandler. Honestly, I used to like Adam Sandler... but after like 5 of his movies, that are all basically the same thing ""Adam doesn't have money."" ""Adam needs money."" ""Adam gets money."" ""Adam is a good guy."" ""Hooray for Adam."" - I wasn't sold on ""Mr. Deeds."" I felt bad for John Turturro. This movie was CLEARLY below him. Supporting actor to Adam Sandler?!? John Turturro was by far the funniest part of the movie. Adam Sandler was still doing the same tired, played out comedy. Move on."
4,Very Funny!!!,"Adam Sandler does another awesome and hilarious job as Longfellow Deeds. Deeds owns a pizza place and writes greeting cards in a small town. He soon inherits 40 billion dollars from his dead uncle. A reporter named Babe Bennett tries to get close to him to get a story. She soon finds out that he is a really sweet guy and doesn't want to continue doing her story because her boss takes her camera and alters Deeds to look like a bad guy, and she feels really bad about it. When he finds out, he gets rid of his money and moves back to his town. He also finds out that the company is about to be sold, so he appears at a shareholders meeting ands tries to stop it. I also like the character, Emilio Lopez because he just appears out of nowhere. I highly recommend MR. DEEDS!!!"
3,amusing,"Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler), a small town pizza shop owner who writes greeting cards (not that Hallmark has accepted any), inherits a $40 billion business from an uncle he never met. So at the behest of the company's executives, he goes to the big city to sign paperwork until the executives can raise the money to buy him out.It's big news, and tabloid TV reporter Babe (Winona Ryder) goes undercover to get the scoop on him.Of course, the executives turn out to be crooked, and Deeds's small-town honesty is needed to save the day. And of course he and Babe fall in love.It's predictable, but fun, and requires major suspension of disbelief. Not a bad way to spend an hour and a half with the kids, but not a movie to purchase for the collection."
3,So-so remake.,"Mr. Deeds starring Adam Sandler is a very loose remake of the Gary Cooper classic Mr. Deeds Goes To Town. The best thing about this 2002 film is the surprisely great chemistry between Sandler and Winona Ryder. Ryder is such a natural actress, her and Sandler are complete opposites when it comes to acting but their different styles seem to mesh well together (who knew?!). The comedy is a bit forced and contrived but there are some amusing moments, give this quriky film a try."
2,I cant get into this one,"I usualy like Adam Sandlers movies, but with this one i just couldnt get into it. It just came off to me as a re-written, (in a diffrent way) version of Sandlers earlier movies. I didnt think this movie was very funny at all, and it was the same thing I have seen Adam play for years, a guy who has a heart of gold, yet this voilent side to him aswell, who finds a girl, struggles to get, then keep the girl, and then do somthing nice and get the girl in the end....sorry, i know alot of people here are saying this is a good movie.... but i feel i've seen it before! and was a bit too predictable IMO... apart from GOING OVERBOARD, this is about the only Adam Sandler flick i couldnt grasp."
4,Funny Comedy,"It is good for laughs. and worth your time, one of Adam Sandler funniest movies. It makes you also think, is there people really that good ?"
4,Mr. Deeds,"As good as any Adam Sandler movie, especially cuz he doesn't talk in that weird voice like he does in Little Nicky"
1,"Horrible, ridiculous, unfunny movie","That about says it all. It's inane and juvenile with colossally bad humor. I couldn't even muster a smile during this piece of junk. Bad, bad, bad. Adam Sandler is always terrible but this is off the deep end of Sandler terribleness. And Winona Ryder just looks embarrassed being in this movie. She mails her performance in and you never once believe she would ever fall for Sandler's Mr. Deeds.Watch the original. Please."
2,disappointing ...,"While I have really enjoyed Sandler in some of his other films and I think he can be very funny, this movie just didn't give him the material he needed to do what it is he does best. My 16 year old told me before I watched this film that it had a ""message"" and didn't have same amount of comedy he was used to watching. He then proceeded to watch ""Billy Madison"" for the umpteenth time mouthing most of the jokes as they happened. This isn't going to happen with Mr. Deeds, nor will it be a classic one to watch over and over.While I felt the movie had some entertainment value, it is definitely one to rent and not one to watch again and again."
2,Phony and cheesy,"I was honestly confused during this movie. A typical Adam Sandler movie is filled with gross humor, and not so nice people. This movie was totally the opposite, but it wasn't good. The actors were fake, predictable, and the plot was very weak. I'm not sure if Adam meant to play his character in a phony, cheesy way, or if he didn't know how to play a nice, regular person. I think that he should stick to his normal roles. I wouldn't suggest you see this movie because it's not very good quality, and you'll want to turn on another movie right after, due to the lack of entertainment."
1,Mr. Deeds is Mr. Dud,"I didn't find a single funny scene in this flick. how can they produce such garbage and actually sell it. winona ryder whom I usually like was pretty bad here too. save your money. There is nothing clever about this movie. This is defintely one of the worse movies of all time. I could not believe they call this a ""comedy"". Three thumbs down!"
3,MY GRADE: C plus to B minus.,"Adam Sandler plays a hick boy who inherits a ton of money from his uncle and goes on to bring his ""country charm"" to the Big Apple. Winona Ryder, who plays a journalist, impersonates a school teacher and lets herself be saved in order to get into his inner circle. The tale is predictable and has a few funny moments but a lot of the humor just falls flat. It's a bit of a shame as there are some good supporting cast in this picture, likePeter Gallagher, Jared Harris and John Turturro.This is a loose remake of ""Mr Deeds Goes to Town"" a superior film compared to this one. But don't let that opinion stop you if you love anything Sandler does. It had a budget of $50M and was loved at the Box Office yielding over $171M.STORY/PLOTTING: C to C plus; HUMOR: C; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus;CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: end of June 2012 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus."
4,Very entertaing,"This movie is basically about this guy who's not that smart and suddenly he gets inherited with 40 bllion dollars. It's Adam Sandler so I was expecting a mediocore comedy thaat doesn't really stay with you, but this proved to be otherwise.It had a poor dvd format, but I don't care, It's a great show"
5,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Wow! What a great movie! I was laughing all the way throught this hilarious comedy about a young man named Longfellow Deeds (Sandler) whos uncle leaves him an enormous fortune after he dies of 40 Billion dollars!!! First, Mr. Deeds meets a girl, so called ""Pam Dawson"" who is supposedly a school nurse from Winchestertonfieldsville, Iowa. Hahaha! What a bad liar! The two love each other, and end up sort of becoming girlfriend/boyfriends. Somehow, Deeds keeps seeing footage of himself, on the show Inside Access, doing some rulebreaking out on the streets and getting drunk. Also, the footage of him saving peoples' lives is turned upside-down to make him look like a loser. After pondering for many days of how the footage was taken, Longfellow Deeds finds out the truth about ""Pam Dawson"" and how the footage was taken. This is a great movie with laughs for everyone in the family, so rent it, grab a bowl of popcorn, sit down, and enjoy this hysterical comedy!"
2,Adam Sandler vs Gary Cooper,"The folks I talked to who loved Mr. Deeds with Adam Sandler were the ones who have never seen the original with Gary Cooper. Among the ones who have seen the Gary Cooper version, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, all including myself, find Gary Cooper's portrayal far superior. So I say, find the Gary Cooper version and compare for yourself. Gary Cooper is unbeatable!!"
3,Not that funny,"I really loved Sandler's fims (Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison), but this one was just, well...stupid. When I rented this I thought it was gonna be laugh-out-loud funny throughout the whole thing. I was wrong. There was only a couple of parts that really made me laugh.So, 2 things to keep in mind if you see ""Mr. Deeds"":1) It's not your average Sandler movie.2) Winona should stick with the dramas."
5,One Of The Best Movies I've Ever Seen,This Movie Is One Of The Best Movies Ever Made. The Only Bad Thing About It Was Casting Winona Ryder As Adam Sandler's Girlfriend.
3,Mr. Deeds - Review,"Longfellow Deeds, a humble guy, inherits controlling interest in a massive media corporation. Deeds starts injecting small-town values into the company with hilarious results! Winona Ryder plays a NY tabloid reporter who's sent undercover to do an exposé on Deeds.Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder, John Turturro; Director: Steven Brill"
3,A few good laughs...,"But not good for repeated viewings like Happy Gilmore. This movie is a bit wooden, especially Winona Ryder's performance. Ick. Adam Sandler is (surprise, surprise) a lovable goofball named Deeds, a pizzeria owner/wannabe greeting card writer who inherits a fortune from an uncle he didn't know he had. He brings a childlike charm to the proper household and meets tabloid reporter Babe Bennett (Ryder), who lies to Deeds to gain his trust so she can get the scoop about him. When her ruse is exposed, Deeds turns his back on her (but not for long). The ending is a bit strange and a letdown - the real heir is revealed, so Deeds returns to small town life with Babe. Aww...happy ending, another formula Sony movie. The true comic gems are Steve Buscemi, Conchata Ferrel and John Turturro (""You underestimate my sneakiness"") in bit roles."
4,Adam's not such a bad guy after all.,"Mr. Deeds is a very funny movie and I couldn't stop laughing!Adam Sandler is his usual silly self without all the cursing,and this time he's actually playing a decent person! This1930's remake of the same movie is a story about friction consisting of doing whats right and being very selfish. Its awesome how Longfellow Deeds is able to keep his simple ways even being a billionare. And one thing's for sure you wont find many wealthy folks giving up all their inheritance away to The United Negro College fund either. Anyway this movie can relate to all people of all backgrounds because it shows how money is not everything. This is a great movie to watch if you love comedy and love to laugh. Hit the video store and watch the older version as well!"
2,Not an Adam Fan,"I am just not a fan of Sandler. I've liked a few of his movies enough to be open minded about seeing a new one when they come out, but this is not one I will watch again. Boring and void of anything interesting I couldn't care less what what goes on in this movie. I cannot recommend this movie at all."
1,One of the most boring Movie,The Movie is super boring. I was expecting more coming from Adam Sandler!!! I regret buying this movie!! He has had great movies but this would be one of the worst movies I've seen. Makes me just want to return the movie since I wont be watching it again!
4,Funny movie,"This is a remake of an older film, which I think was derived from a book. Saw the older version, never read the book. I don't remember the other version very well, so will not try to make any comparisons here. To begin with, this is light comedy, sometimes going into the realm of slapstick, so don't watch this if you're looking for Wodehouse or Wilde. I like the story, and I particularly like the Deeds character, I wish there were more people in the world like him. That said, I can't say that any acting performance in the film really impressed me much. This is just a good, generally clean, comedy. I give it 4 stars strictly for the laughs."
3,All right,"This is typical Adam Sandler fare - comedy mixed into the story. I can't say this is one of his better films - it's more of a movie rental than to buy, unless you're a die-hard Sandler fan.The story is entertaining, but honestly, the movie could have been written better, especially regarding the inheritance. But there's a decent amount of Adam Sandler-esque slapstick comedy bits to be entertaining."
2,Don't Bother,Do yourself a favor and watch the original Gary Cooper movie instead. The acting may be a little over the top but just like It's A Wonderful Life the story works better in the 1930's. The idea of a gullible country bumpkin was more believable prior to cable TV and the internet.Also the chemistry between Adam Sandler and Winona Ryder is just painful to watch.
3,Great Audio and Video Quality,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was great, but not perfect. I was not disappointed with it. I give it a 9.3 on a 10 point scale.The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 was also very good.The movie overall was okay, not great."
3,Another Adam Sandler-type movie,"Just like other 'Adam Sandler' movies, this is a funny movie albeit one that does not require much of your brains. It is recommendable for those lazy weekend afternoons. & as expected, just like most (if not all) of Adam Sandler's movies, Rob Schneider takes a cameo role. You simply must NOT have any expectations to enjoy it. Happy viewing :-)"
1,Not worth the money,"Taper off one cigarette per day, after that, carry around some cinnamon gum to ward off cravings. I guess this could be considered a 'spoiler' but in my mind that would only be the case if this 'method' were in any way original. It is not. I heard the exact same advice twenty-odd years ago..Seriously the book is very, very short and devoid of any new knowledge. There are no testimonials, scientific studies, or sage wisdom. There is no chronology of struggles and successes. If it used a standard type font (instead of enormous 24(?) point) the whole thing could be done on one type-written page.Seriously, I bought this book, sight unseen, after hearing some guy on the radio mention it... There is nothing else to it except a list of obvious reasons to quit smoking... but if you are in the market for this book, you already know all those... Save your money..."
2,Not the full story,"This dvd was well made, and was a good American Experience production of an underrated president. My main issue with this dvd was that it said nothing, NOTHING about the First Iraq War. I don't understand how you can make a documentary about a president, who is to be the nation's commander in chief for the military and not say anything about the biggest military action of the 90's under Bush Sr.I couldn't imagine talking about FDR and not WWII, LBJ and not Vietnam, or Wilson and WWI, but we can talk about George Bush Sr. and not talk about Operation Desert Storm; it's almost like they wanted to ignore it, as if to avoid it.This is a major failure of this video! If you are looking for a full story of this president watch something else."
4,More respect for this president than before,First of i am a very loyal dem. i was 18 when Bush Sr was elected president in 1988 and i voted against him that year for Dukakis and in 1992 for Clinton. That aside after buying this dvd off amazon.com and watching it i appreciate him more. he was a war hero in ww 2 all they way. he even went against his gop leanings to work with the dems in congress at times at the rage of conservatives in his party. He did what he thought was right. now does that mean i would have voted for him back then in hindsight? nope not really. but i give props to pbs for a great insight of his life. His son W. is another matter entirely(eyeroll). but that is another review.
2,Picture is deceiving - Disappointing,"Read the measurements carefully...this is MUCH smaller than it appears, and not high quality. I've not been impressed with Amazon's jewelry in the slightest."
1,"Could not burn using PC, Win XP and Nero inCD","Unfortunately I could not burn to a single one of these (nor to any of their CD versions). I bought 10 of each (CD and DVD). I'm running a Dell PC using Win XP and Nero burning software (inCD). I do not know the technical reasons why, but not a single one of these would work on my computer. I tried them on one other Dell PC computer which uses XP profesional and they would not burn either, so I just wanted to give a ""heads up""."
5,"McCaffrey, Smooth & tropic",I love it! You can play this all the time and not tire of it.Very Unique!
5,"McCaffrey, ""Smooth & Tropic""","Extremely original album! Lots of variety. A very ""international"", world album. Each track is unique."
4,Great classic scifi,Ever wonder who first came up with the idea of a space ship crew's descendants reverting to primitivism. Ben Bova thought of it first.
3,Buyer beware!,"I was unable to test the Thrustmaster Elite Rudder Pedals as they are completely imcompatable with my Force Feedback Joystick. Just a word of caution to prosective buyers - If you plan to use these rudder pedals with any version of Logitech Wingman Joystick, I would strongly suggest you first visit Logitech's website to insure that they are compatable with Third Party Analog Rudder Pedals. Due to my own fault, I failed to do ALL my homework before ordering, and, eventhough Amazon took them back, I, non the less, had to pay for return shipping. I was very impressed with the weight and positive feel of the pedals, and am truly sorry they would not work with my system."
4,Good For Basic Rudder Pedals,I have used these rudder pedals before and after obtaining a pilot's license. I purchased them sometime ago to use with Flight Unlimited III and Flight Simulator 98. They serve the purpose of having pedals vs using the keyboard or joystick for this function. To obtain more realism in rudder pedals you would have to spend considerably more. While earning my license they did serve the purpose of getting used to their function to taxi and also good (if you turn off auto coordination in your software program) for practicing coordinated turns and proper takeoff application. They are sturdy and have held up for many years.
5,overnight,This product works great on overnight treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.Give it time to dry on your scalp and NOTHING comes off onto your bed linens.
3,Burns a lot,"I have pretty significant psoriasis. This product was thin and needed thick application to see little, if any result. Perhaps it would work best on only mild cases."
2,website color representations confusing,"It might be my eyes, but the taupe and caramel colors look identical. Too bad. The price seems right but the uncertainty of what the product actually looks like is a deal-breaker. That, and no mention of the pile weight (e.g., 18oz, 22oz)."
5,Excellent Saw,It's a very good saw. Very light and effective. The leather strap could be replaced with paracord to make it tactical :P.
4,Looks more expensive than it is. No universal key option.,"Great lock, looks good, feels solid. I bought it from my front door. I was hoping for an easy path to having one key for all my Schlage locks but this is not the case here. :( I have 2 other Schlage locks that came with a special key to allow re-calibration and be able to have 1 key for all doors. This Dexter doesn't have this. I erroneously assumed that at this price range it'd be possible. It took me a couple months to install my front door and the lock set so I didn't return it. The aged bronze looks good so I'm not terribly upset."
4,Foundations,"While I rate B5 as 5-star Sci-Fi series (leaving every incarnation of Star Trek in the dust) I only give this pack 4-stars and the beginning of season 1 gets only 3. Season one seemed to thrash about looking for a purpose before the story arc really took form and charicture. Chrysalis is a must own as it fails to pull a single punch, leaving you breathless at the end. Quality of Mercy is a little ""Treky"" in it's presentation. Babylon Squared is neat in that it sets the foundation for things to come. Voice in the Wilderness is a standout in season 1 for its good writing, but again some of the concepts seem a little ""Treky"""
5,Reagan believed in something greater than himself.,Hearing these speeches bring back fond memories. Reagan's secret as a communicator was that he believed what he said and made the listener feel that sincerity in his heart.
2,Looking for Definitive Reagan material? This isn't it!,"I've been trying to figure out the most cost-effective way to get my hands on as much good Reagan stuff as possible. I shyed away from the expensive 4-vol video set and got two volumes of this CD series, but it's very disappointing. The track ""Berlin Wall"" isn't even THE speech at the Berlin Wall. Also missing is the great speech he gave before the Pres. election of 1964. Of course there's great stuff here (""Farewell Address"" for ex.) but I enjoyed the books-on-tape version of ""In His Own Words"", rather than this mish-mash of convention speeches and Statue of the Union addresses..."
5,You have to admire this man,"Maybe it's because of the fact that since Reagan was President, we haven't had any leadership that was strong or honest, or maybe it's because Reagan was such a strong leader with moral core values, but one can sure be nostalgic to return to that ""decade of greed"" that seems to have so many liberals upset these days. Listening to his speeches brings the warm feeling of a time that seems so long ago and may never be repeated in our lifetimes. His words and speeches will upset the right people, and warm the hearts of the good folks. He dispised communists and communism and as is apparent today, they don't care much for him. That's a good thing. We still hear their complaints of him today. Now - I wish they would put on CD all of his radio addresses. That is a CD I would purchase in a heartbeat."
2,CAUTION - Mis Advertised,"This CD advertises that it contains the ""Berlin Wall"" Speach. It does NOT. So, if you're looking for that one, dont' buy this CD."
3,They Left Too Much Out,"Seems like most of the good and famous stuff was left out. Either they weren't very good at what they were doing or they did it on purpose. They should have at least put this quote in there:""America is on the move again and expanding toward new eras of opportunity for everyone. Now were accused of having a secret. Well if we have it is that we're going to keep the mighty engine of this nation revved up and that means a future of sustained economic growth without inflation that's going to create for our children and grand children a prosperity that finally will last!"""
3,Cowboy Chic,"I enjoyed the book, but I was a bit disappointed, since there wasn't enough technical decorating information on color schemes, regional variations in styles, etc.Great pictures, though."
5,Covers It Nicely,"It will cover any area that you want it to.Big and small, it will get the job done.Overall, it deserves a 5-star rating and I would recommend this product to anyone that has holes to cover/fix."
5,GREAT for larger holes,"This product is fantastic for repairing those larger holes, dents etch in your drywall. Used it throughout our kitchen/tv room remodel. creates a strong patch....in fact I was a little amazed at just how strong the patch was. After putting this up and adding compound you would be hard pressed to find it either visually or by pushing on the patch."
3,Too heavy for travelling purposes,"This product is too heavy to use for travel nowadays with all the weight restrictions. Further, it did not come with a travel bag as advertised. I sent an inquiry asking where it was and could i get the travel bag. I am still waiting for a repy which means no one bothered to respond back."
2,not what i needed,"Item To heavy to mount on mirror or wall with suction cups provided. Item to heavy to carry on a plane in suitcase. I read some of the reviews before buying but still thought the item would work, but i was wrong."
4,Mirror,This would have been better if the bottom mirror which has the largest magnification would be more easily accessible. other than that it is a pretty good mirror
3,Wouldn't really call it a Travel sized mirror...,"...unless you usually carry something this cumbersome when you travel. I found it slightly heavy, awkward and inconvenient to even consider packing it in suitcase. It would be perfectly suited as a useful, non-travel, bathroom counter or bureau top mirror. Unfortunately that was not what I was looking for or needing at this time so it was returned."
3,gooseneck not very goosy,it didn't seem to have very much range in the goose neck. The 10X is on the lone side and I even tried to swop the positions and that didn't work either. I think the goose neck flexibleness is because it is too short.
2,"Author In Search of a Plot,Unfortunately She never Finds One","Several years ago I read ""The Hide and Seek Files"" by this author, and it was an EXCELLENT book.Thinking that Ms. March undoubtedly had more than one good book in her, I ordered and read ""Between the Worlds.""Perhaps Ms. March does have more than one good book in her. I sincerely hope so, but Between the Worlds wasn't one of them. I have not read any of her other books, but the two mentioned here, at this time.A typical paragraph from Between the Worlds is the one given here: ""I do not want to be an unquiet ghost woman hovering in the glades and groves, endlessly circling the old stones and calling and calling for ever simply because in this life I was unvoiced for ever.""The story, such as it is, centers around Lerryn and her female lover, Tarn. It also deals with their problems with past loves, their present children & grandchildren, and explores the issues of women being accused of witchcraft in the past, and the need for women's land."
1,Not what I expected,"I returned this after I received it. To me it looked very cheap and not worth the cost. Looked like a child's charm, but it was hand crafted. The return was very easy and they handled it very well. It was a good company to deal with, unfortunately I was not satisfied with the item."
5,Can be used as a informative supplement to class room text.,I am a chemistry major and found a lot of informative material included. The book explained the ideas thoroughly and the problems at the end of each section were a good source of review and practice. Everything was straight forward and easy to comprehend.
4,"Different, but excellent","Robbie's fans won't be surprised that he's once again re-invented himself with a new style. While ""I've Been Expecting You"" differed only slightly in format from ""Life Thru a Lens,"" ""Sing When You're Winning"" and ""Swing When You're Winning"" both marked extreme departures for Robbie. Both, however, were wonderful and showed a great deal of flexibility for the singer.The same can be said for ""Escapology."" The style is much different from any of Robbie's previous releases, but this is not a bad thing. The album's a great listen straight through. My only reason for giving the album four stars instead of five is that the new style is just a bit too radio-friendly for me. Perhaps this is Robbie's continued attempt to break into the US music scene. In any case, buy ""Escapology"" and be rewarded with something new and refreshing."
5,80 million- well worth it!,"Robbie's brand spanking new album, Escapology, is simply amazing. A brilliant blend of rock and pop, mixing old Robbie flavas with brave new ones. As always Robbie's tunes are heart felt and sung with brutal honesty. ""Come Undone"" is catchy, witty and full of robbisms! While "" sexed up"" is a beautiful ballad that provokes emotion even in the steel-hearted. If you liked Robbie's other work, especially I've Been Expecting You then this is for you. If you didn't then this album cannot fail to convert you into a true Robbie fan."
5,WHY DON`T YOU LIKE THIS CUTE GUY?!?,"HI I'm from Germany and here Robbie is a MEGA-star! My favourite songs are: Angels + Let me entertain you (Life thru a lens), Rock DJ + Kids (Sing when you`re winning), Feel + Come undone + Something beautiful (Escapology)! I can just tell you that his songs are great and he is one of the biggest entertainer alive. I also like ""harder"" music like Eminem or Linkin Park, but Robbie made his own thing and this is really really good!"
4,Will he finally make it here?,"He's a mega star all over the globe, 5 years strong; but in our little world he's Robbie who? Will he make it here this time? Chances are NO! I bought the Euro version months ago and love it. Even thou his US label changed the org. tracks (for the better I think) the Radio Gods (programmers) still wont give him a chance. Keep up the hip hop,rap and the same tired rock. I for one know better. If your a fan of RW obtain both versions."
2,He really need to escape for a while,"I purchased almost all Robbie's albums and DVDs, but this one is really way disappointing.He definately wants to try everything but he totally lost his style this time.If I heard these songs from the radio, I won't believe they are from the great star in Singing When You're Winning. The music is restless and in trand, but could be from any 20 year old new comer.Maybe the right thing for Robbie to do is to escape from his success for sometime."
4,Escapology proper.,"This is the real version of ""Escapology"" (the United States received an oddly-edited version that wiped away most of the rock tracks, added a couple UK B-sides, and generally neutered the record's overall effect).This was Williams' final album with Guy Chambers, and although the songwriting is perhaps not at the level of their previous albums, in hindsight it definitely represents the end of an era in Robbie's career, as he has since gone on to work with various songwriters and producers, occasionally succeeding but more often than not leaving fans longing for the glory days. Standout tracks include of course the mega-single 'Feel', the epic 'Come Undone', and the Elton-John-inspired 'Hot Fudge', along with 'Nan's Song', the first track credited to Robbie alone as songwriter.""Escapology"" may not be a stone cold masterpiece, but it is a grand finale to a great songwriting partnership, and an increasingly obvious bookmark in an amazing pop music career."
5,Excellent british pop,Great british pop by Robbie williams. This is my second record by him .Will buy more in the future by the same artist.Excellent tunes.
1,Help with hidden tracks???,"Track 14 (Nan's Song) contains 2 hidden songs. The first oneruns from 3:58 to 5:57 and the second one begins at 12:09.I found out the second song is called ""I Tried Love,"" butstill need help with the first song. If anyone can help,please e-mail me at joechan099 at hotmail. Thanx in advance."
1,Half A Star Rating Is Proper,"To compare him to Elton John(True KING OF POP) and George Michael(Pop Prince Of Yesteryear)is ridiculous! This is the BLANDEST recorded music from any artist...lackluster, no punch noise. Just because a guy strips naked and shows his privates doesn't make him a ""musician"". Williams is so lucky to have scored the mediocre ""Angels"" as any form a hit single in the U.S.A., period. So called 'singers' of his calibre are a dime a dozen here in America. Nick Lachey's ""Soulo"" album easily outshines any of Williams' recorded efforts on any level. And all you people wonder WHY America hasn't caught on to pseudoporn pinup Williams?"
2,Don't let the cover fool you,"I saw this album and I thought cool title,cool cover and it's Robbie Williams,ex Take That member.I bought it and I was like what is this?The lyrics make no sense and the music is so boring.The only good songs Robbie Williams has done are with Take That and ""Angels""."
5,"1 if by land, 2 if by sea-- 3 if by CD! They're back...","Wow. As a brand new US fan of this cheeky Brit, I am bowled over by the quality of the songs in this collection. ""Feel"" is sensual & addictive; and there is a song for every mood, and maybe a few you haven't felt yet! Guy Chambers was so much a part of this recording, it saddens me that they have parted ways, so ENJOY what may be their last collaboration and keep your fingers crossed..."
4,Handsome Man,"Robbie Williams is so huge & yet most Americans have no idea who he is. He is amazing. He is so honest & so out there & so in your face. He knows exactly who he is, exactly what his place is in this world & exactly how much fun he's going to have while he's on top. I adore him & adore this CD. It's all I've been listening to since I got it a few days ago."
4,Awesome,"I'm a Californian and I have all six of Robbie's albums. This one is my #2 favorite (1st is Sing When You're Winning). The song ""Always and Forever"" is a beautiful, slow tempo song. ""Sexed Up"" is in that same vein; it's kind of sad if you understand what it's really about. If you like songs that are more uppity and pop, try ""Hot Fudge"" or ""Monsoon"". Great song and lyrics to sing along to! One of my favorite songs on the whole album is ""Come Undone"" which is his new single I think. It's very powerful and is true Robbie. The booklet also has cool photos. I hope Robbie tours America very soon!!!"
5,He's getting even better!,"I think too many people reviewing this album tend to write Robbie Williams off as a brat and therefore start off biased to anythin he does. Shame really, because the guy's much more than a popcorn munching teenybopper. Escapology is an album that sounds different from anything he's done before and covers a lot of new ground. Tracks like Feel, Revolution, The World's most handsome man, Monsoon and Hot Fudge are all first class and deserve extended airplay. The other tracks are excellent too, but special mention must be made of Me and my Monkey and Nan's song which are by far the best songs on the album. Don't mis the hidden tracks on the CD especially the second one which is a scream.Go on give the guy a chance to grow on you. I promise you he's worth the trouble. Music needs characters like Robbie Williams to kee things interesting."
3,Warning: copy protected not-CD,"Warning! When I bought this from Amazon, it came as oneof the new ""copy protected"" not-CDs that have recentlybeen coming out.These may not play on all systems, especially computers.(When I tried to play it on my Windows PC it crashed the PCso hard I had to power-cycle it)Music is pretty good, some outstanding tracks, a couple fillers."
3,Not up to par...,"Initially I was very excited to hear Robbie Williams was going to release a new album with original tracks. However, upon purchase of the album I have found that the American version is edited for content. This completely destroys any since of rhythm in some songs. Further more I have found only 3 or 4 acceptable tracks on the album that resemble his earlier work. Sorry Robbie but ""album fillers"" are not acceptable, especially when your American audience is already struggling to get you air play. In closing if you are on the fence about which album to purchase I would highly recommend ""THE EGO HAS LANDED"" and ""SING WHEN YOU'RE WINNING"" the three or four good tracks are worth downloading but that's about it. Tracks 1, 4, 5, 11"
3,ny music lover,"This CD was OK & it was also the first one I purchased by this artist. I think Rolling Stone Magazine got it right when they gave it 3 stars also. ""Me & My Monkey"" is over 7 min. long & it is a little strange-sounding in words & music, but of course that's what we've come to expect from Robbie Williams, I guess. ""Something Beautiful"" is the best song on the CD. Nice beat & great words."
5,Robbie Wins while he's winning.,"As a long-time Robbie fan (Okay then, since Slane) this album shines with Robbie's growth as a songwriter. The many time songwriter of the year winner wins again.Just like the hit song ""Millenium"" showed the cheeky-rebel can't cheat the oncoming middle age mellowness, but it's a fresh combination that exudes from the earlier tracks in the album. The imp still lives, in the man! Buy it.With Robbies earlier albums already Five star earners, this album should be a six."
3,Escapolgy an escape,"I found this cd a little short of pizzaz. It's style did remind me of Rod Stewart's latest effort in covering the standards, so can only say it is fairly pleasant. Sure was not as good as I would have hoped, but far better than Williams previous release here.A successful recent release by Michael Bublé may well have made Williams' entry into this market a little easier. And this IS a fair alternative to top 40 pop...."
2,Arrogance doesn't pay !,"A star can't shine forever, ain't it ? At least to me ! Mind you, I was a big Robbie fan, owning all his albums and singles, until he turned Sinatra. Being the most decorated Brit popstar, and later managed to be a sweet ol' crooner, really got to his head I suppose ! None of the 14 songs here is even worthy of mention. Simply said, they are all tuneless and void of melody. I can't even remember a single tune here, not to mention his arrogant lyrics (especially in ""Handsome Man""). Has any songs been released as singles ? Not that I know of. Well, none of em is good enough !"
1,Ear Candy music,"If Robbie Willimas could be compared to a food type itwould be KFC, nice to listen to, but it has no value whatso ever. The songs are so simple on this cd, it could ofbeen written by a child.He really needs to go back to music school, Sexed Up is justplain stupid, his image of going out and getting drunk wonthelp the dismal first week sales either. Robbie has reallyhurt himself with this album. Its quite sad, really."
1,He should stick to drinking,"Yeppers give it a rest Robbie, their is nothing worsethan a man, trying to act and sing like a 14 year old.The music on this album will take your breath away becauseits so bad. He trys to go deep on the album's ballads, buthe sounds like a wash up Vegas singer. This must be withouta doubt, the worst of this career, he needs to grow up interms of his image and his music, or else he wont be aroundin a years time."
4,"SOUNDTRACK, not SONGTRACK","Sarah, it's people like you that tick me off. You don't realize how hard it is for composers (do you know what a 'composer' is?) to create a new theme and new music for every film they're hired to do. This is a SOUNDTRACK, i.e. it's music from the movie. It's not a SONGTRACK. If you want SONGS, go buy a group album. And if it doesn't have what you want on it, DON'T BUY IT!!Oh, and John Powell's music is awesome!"
1,that song,"Artist Name is ""Wild Cherry""Song Title is ""Play That Funky Music White Boy""not include........."
1,dissapointing,"My opinion bout this cd is quite the same as corinne brocki.. I'm really eager to buy this soundtrack so so much because I love the songs in the movie, yet the orchestra songs good 2.. but I've search in many cd's stores and still could find the cd.. they said the cd hasn't come out yet.. so I check in the internet to know when it would come out in indonesia and get some review of the musics inside the cd but I can't find any kind of music except orchestra.. =( I really really want to hear the songs in the movieeee but not the orchestra one. pls pls pls pls compiled the songs in the movie into a cd.. I really like it so much!!! ^ ^"
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,"This CD is not exactly what I was looking for but for a score soundtrack, its not bad. Evolution had such great songs in it even though the movie was only so-so. I was hoping that this soundtrack had those songs but it didn't. It was just the score. Because it is a pretty good score, I will still give it a 3."
4,evolution,"hey guys im soo desperate to know what is the name of that funky song played in the party where sean william scott acts as the bartender, it is the part right before the crocodile-like alien springs out the lake by the golf coarse and eats that guy who wants to wash his trousers cuz he spilled wine on it. the movie is a good movie, but it was under used in soo many ways."
2,Egyptian song,"I saw the movie, and in the beginning of the movie there was this really weird music with an egyptian sound somewhere. The music was played during the scene where we first get to see the school where the two ""heroes"" of the story work. Could anyone help me find out who the arist(s) is/are and what the title of this song is, because it kinda rocked :)"
5,It's great,"This soundtrack has great music... and a note to Sarah, this is a soundtrack with the movies score, not from all the music used in the film. The PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC is only used in the movie, but wasn't created in the movie and it's not it's theme. Again, great movie score (soundtrack) from a great movie!"
3,"question about the ""songs"" from the movie","where can i find ""out with a bang""if anyone knows can you post it up?thanks"
3,Title of Song?,"I only know that the song that was played in sean willam scott's car right at the beginning of the show..it's ""Borderline"" by Buckcherry.But I wanna know the catchy tune in which david duchovny and orlando jones were in the jeep...towards the end of the show!thanx!"
2,Name Of The Ending Credits Song!,"Hi everyone to clear things up if you are looking for the song at the end of the film ""Where the smiley face appears"" its called ""Out With A Bang"" By ""Self"" now this is a really hard song to find its from their album ""Ornament And Crime"" if u manage to get a copy like my self u wont be disapointed! :), as for this soundtrack :( it anit my cup of tea as my fav song ""Self"" was not included, to bad! anyways just thought i'd give u guys my 2 cents worth ;)."
1,Don't buy it!,"Beware! This CD is only the background music from the movie, none of the good songs or even vocal overlays. It is a supreme disapointment."
3,What song,what is the song when the kids start to party outside the college.. it's a heavy metal a song and goes like give up or get up .. pleaze help me
2,OK SOundtrack,"Now I bought this soundtrack because I wanted to hear that song that was played very often through the whole movie. You know the oe where the french horns are playing that carnival music and that lady hums with it, that's not on the soundtrack. Maybe it is and it's hiddn within, but it's not in any of the songs I listened to. The music is ok though."
4,Need to know the name of the song,I create music videos and I wanted to use the song at the end of teh movie. It's the part where the smile face fades away and they're driving down the road with one of the flying aliens. Does anyone know the name?
1,review,The book was informative but the materials neede for the project were not as stable. The product had to be redone several times.
4,"Not just Vastu tradition, but a wonderful sense of style","This interesting book provides a useful introduction to the Vastu tradition, which many have compared to feng shui. However, the photographs in this book demonstrate a great sense of style, color, and design. Designers and even architects will find something of use here."
3,This was an ok book,"This book was boring in the beginning, but during the middle and the end, it became good... I really dont have much to say about it... it was ok, but I am looking forward to reading getting to the good part and blind ambitions..."
4,It Shows the true meaning of Best Friends,"I have read a lot of novels, mostly about the male/female relationships. This novel really focus on how a friendship should be. Misty and Reesy were the only children for their parents and they had a bond that most sister don't have. It was refreshing to read a novel that focused mainly on this and not relationship. These women were there for each other through thick and then, they had each others back when needed, and they broke each other down when needed. To be honest they keep one another grounded. I really enjoyed this book and I would suggest reading it, if you don't have a bestfriend now, when you finsh this book, you will want one."
5,READING SATISFACTION GUARANTEED,"Scenes From A Sistah is a definite must read for all. It is a witty and heartfelt story about the trials and tribulations of a true friendship. Misty Fine has it all when it comes to her career and finances but she's not that successful when it comes to choosing men. Unlike Misty, Reesy Snowden is not at all concerned with a career. Even though she comes from very successful parents and is educated. Reesy keeps Misty from falling apart when her relationships come apart.Lolita made this a wonderful and enjoying journey into the lives of two unforgettable characters. I hope to be able to make another trip in the near future. Much love to you Lolita, for you are a true asset to African American Readers. And an inspiration to aspiring writers"
4,GOOD BOOK BUT HAD NO PLOT,"This book was okay but there was no definite plot.Don't get me wrong it was funny,vibrant and sexy but it lacked something."
5,What a page turner,"this book was great it kept me reading for hours. I love to see when African American females are portrayed as being intelligent and strong, while also showing their weaknesses."
4,WHAT ENDING..........,"I READ THIS BOOK IN 1 DAY. OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE GIRLS TO THE END. TRUE SISTERHOOD. I KEPT HOPING THAT REESY WAS GOING TO FIND SOMEONE. STEFAN HAD SOME REAL ISSUES. I CANT BELIEVE MISTY BELIEVED ROMAN. I GLAD THERE'S A SEQUEL, CAUSE THAT WASN'T MUCH OF AN ENDING."
4,This book had some great scenes,I read this book in less than a day and enjoyed it. It was fast reading and kept you wanting more. More could of evolved more from the ending.
4,a book about and for girlfriends,"Highly entertaining and enjoyable...although I couldn't believe sometimes how gullible Misty could be regarding men even though she was quite competent and professional regarding her career. This is a book that I recommend to others especially reading groups. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get upset but you'll still want to read this book until the end."
4,All I can say is WOW!,"I am an avid reader of all books that are written by african american authors... but this book was really wonderful! I read the entire book in about 4 hours... I couldn't put it down. If you want to simply loose yourself into the real life trials and tribulations of real life sistahs... then this is the book for you! I just ordered ""getting to the good part...."" I can't wait!"
5,Exceptional!!!,This book was an exceptional story of unconditional love and friendship. I was very pleased with this book and I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes to read. It was also very funny.
2,Not a novel; may be better as a group of short stories,The author goes into too much depth in some areas (e.g. the chapter about pubic hair) and not enough depth in other areas (e.g. the relationship between her fiance & his mother). I may have enjoyed this book more if it were written in the form of a group of short stories as opposed to a novel. The book seemed to run out of steam and I got the impression that so did Ms. Files as the ending seemed weak.
2,Sterotypical and Typical,"I don't know how this book has gotten five stars. I'm not saying it's awful but...I really can't get into how this women ""misty"" does what she did to get and keep a man. I'm tired of these stories. Black women are not all suckers and I'm tired of reading about how we are. The sexual sterotypes are exhausting. I'm sorry, but thumbs down on this one. (As an aside. My Brother, on the other hand loved the book and feels that his life matches misty's...interesting!)"
1,boring,"I thought this book was the most boring book I have ever read. I read a lot African-American books and I have my own library collection. I loved Lolita Files book ""Child of God"" but I cannot for the life of me finish this book. The next series sounds interesting but I am leery of purchasing that book. But really this book is too slow. I want to go ahead and read Taste Like Chicken but I like to start from the beginning so I can get a feel of the characters. Who knows, but please how can you rate this book as being a very good read, it is a VERY SLOW READ."
5,"Real,Raw and Hilarious","I received this book as a gift. My husband and I took turns reading it to each other, at bedtime. Oftentimes, we had knots in our stomachs, from laughing. Together, we finished the book in three nights. Before closing my eyes, I often joked, "" Don't imitate Stefan, use the bathroom before you dose off!"" This is one of my fondest memories, as my husband often spoke highly of meeting Ms. Files. He died later that month on May 21, 1997. Thank you Ms. Files, for being a part of some of our last sharing.We really enjoyed it. You are on your way. Thank you. END"
3,"Interesting story, not impressively written","While I enjoyed the story, I wasn't thrilled with the quality of writing. Then again, I'm a professional editor, so I should probably be more forgiving. The book provides really interesting insight into the world of high-end pot growing and competition, which I found fascinating. Just expect some stoner-style attempts at flowery prose that gets tiresome fairly quickly."
5,Great compilation and excellent Live recording...,"This collection of Hans Zimmer movie soundtrack songs, ""Wings of a Film"", is a beautiful compilation. I was especially stoked to find the lovely and haunting ""Thunderbird"" theme from the film ""Thelma & Louise"", at last presented in its entirety. This tune's absence (there's a truncated version) from the ""Thelma & Louise"" soundtrack album was a glaring omission, and thankfully it can be found on this recording, faithfully and beautifully executed by slide guitar virtuoso Pete Haycock (who performed it for the film). It's an absolutely beautiful version...I recommend this Hans Zimmer album in its entirety, and I also recommend Pete Haycock's new CD, ""Pete Haycock's True Blues LIVE"", which features more amazing slide guitar artistry by this artist (check out the RMI Sound website or Pete Haycock's website for info).Kudos to Hans for this collection of film music!"
2,Disappointed,"I am surprised that so many gave this color book a good review. It has very few pages, and was a disappointment to me. I wish I had bought a thicker one, as Ihad to purchase another gift, just so this one wouldn't look so cheap."
5,great for my daughter,"Some have complained about the amount of coloring pages being too low, but honestly for 2 dollars this book is great. each princess has like 10 coloring pages so this was a great stocking stuffer this year. For 2 dollars i dont think you could get better, my girl colors all the time and still has plenty of pages left."
4,Historical perspective from a coalition partner,"Thoroughly enjoyed reading a British version of the political and military events leading to the UN mission in Korea. Understandably long on detail regarding the British brigade and the Commonwealth division, this twenty-year-old history provides useful insights into the motivations and concerns of a ""junior partner"" in coalition warfare (a la Operation Iraqi Freedom). Organized chronologically, this history explores general themes in each chapter (command structure, readiness, prisoners of war, etc.). This tends to make it an occasionally repetitious but still worthwhile read."
4,Excellent History of a lesser-known conflict,"Author Max Hastings does an excellent job of providing an overall military and political history of the Korean War. His writing is clear and informative and the reader comes away with a strong understanding of the events that shaped this conflict. Hastings is more objective than many historians and presents an unbiased account of the decisions and mistakes that shaped the conflict. This book is highly recommended for anyone trying to understand this ""Forgotten War."""
2,Not so impressed,"Having read this book after several others on the subject I found it a little disappointing. It's obvious that the author is British because a larger portion of the book is devoted to the British units than is probably justified considering they comprised only a small fraction of the UN forces. For a more insightful and comprehensive rendition of the events of the Korean War, I recommend ""Korea: The Untold Story of the War"" by Joseph C Goulden."
2,Red China definitely used Chiang's old weapons arsenal,"The US provided Chiang with many weapons to fight both Japanese and Communists. When Mao Zedong took mainland China he inherited a huge arsenal of american-made weapons (like Khomeini did from the ousted Shah in Iran in 1979). Go to search engines and put in in quotes Li-Fujen: Kuomintang Faces Doom (1949). This is for more on Chiang's defecting-to-Mao soldiers having american weapons.These american-made weapons definitely helped the Red Chinese cause. This book is definitely too flattering to Red China. And the US was 97% of the UN fighting force in Korea. Americans had 5,764,143 men in combat in Korea. The rest of the UN contributed a small 156,000. The US was way more efficient than Red China in this war case closed."
3,A little too complimentary to Red China,I found the Chinese Communists to be sloppy in this conflict. They seem to have lost about eight times as many people as the US did in this war! Yet Hastings is slightly too admiring of their performance in the Korean War. To me they just got lucky they got their hands on US weapons formerly owned by Chiang Kai-shek.
4,A good overview,"British Historian Max Hasting's gives the ""forgotten war"" the kind of good overall one volume treatment that it deserves. For some reason, Korea has just never registered with Americans the way World War Two or Vietnam has. But the stakes were high as America rushed its untrained Pacific army from Japan to the Korean peninsula in a desperate attempt to forestall a communist takeover of the South in 1950. The heroism of those first soldiers cannot be understated. Hastings captures the whole saga of the war as a horrible tragedy and as the first test of the West's determination to literally fight the spread of communism. Ultimately, as Hastings points out, the sacrifice of the allied troops was not in vain. That democracy exists today in South Korea is a testement to those who fought and died to preserve the country's freedom."
5,Great Head Bolt Set,I purchased this head bolt set a couple months ago and all of them fit the engine and heads great and have held up with not problems or leaks as of yet.
3,Pretty good wireless lapel microphone,"I have been using the Shure PG14 / PG185 sysytem for 2 weeks now at my Unitarian Universalist church. It was realativly inexpensive, but not what I would call ""cheap"". The included condensor microphone is of good quailty. There are no drop outs or static even when the transmiter unit is a good 95 feet from the reciver. The antenna's for the reciver are inside the box, so you can't bend or break them. I did not expect a ""dual diversity"" reciver and audio companding for around 300 dollars. My only probem was the output from the reciver was not enough to drive my high level input on the Mackie mixer to anything more than a whisper. I sacrificed one of my microphone channels ( The system also has ""mic level"" output), wich has way more gain, and the system works pretty good now. It's worth the price. It's good for church use."
5,Plug and Play,"This unit was virtually plug-n-play, It works well with our existing sound system. The sound is excellent and the quality is good especially for the reasonable price."
4,Solid wireless system!,"I've used cheaper imitations and they always disappoint. The Shure wireless system is easy to use and consistently operates, thus far I have had no frequency interruptions!"
5,Great mug,"It is the perfect mug for the ""not such a morning person"". Leave me alone til I have my morning coffee. It is very well made and a nice big size."
2,"too much cross, not enough cowboy","I was really looking forward to reading this book, but after only a few chapters my disappointment was overwhelming. Bill Watts has a really interesting story to tell. Sadly, he forcibly and REPEATEDLY inserts his religous awakening into every annecdote in this book, thereby ruining the entire tale... Would NOT be a good addition to any library outside of a church or prison."
2,Blowhard,"Big Watts is a big fat egomaniacal gas bag. This blowhard can't help but come off as a narcissist of the highest order. Even though he is a 'born again Christian' he still can't help but tell pathetic story after pathetic story tooting his own horn about how tough he was, how crazy he was and how WATTS would SMASH, stretch or pluck somebody's eyeball out and you can just see his ego and pride swell. He is a carney. His ego was so big that there wasn't even enough room for his own kids. He ran them off with his obnoxious behavior too.Bill Watts is somebody that I hope I never meet and somebody I think that needs a lot of therapy. I hope he gets it."
3,Rating The Bill Watts Story,"I liked this book. It had a lot of good information, however, I felt that it contained too many details and would have been better if it had contained at least 50 less pages."
4,The stories behind success...,"Everyone knows there's no such thing as ""overnight success"". The back stories are legendary now, but that's the story of this album. Don & Dick Addrisi were recognized songwriters who were one their way to better recognition as artists in their own right. However, the vaults at record companies are filled with the last president's projects that the new president doesn't want to handle. These demos languished for too long, but now see the light of day. Those interested in these fine songwriters will find the initial demos of interest and some of the other unreleased songs. Those only interested in the 'hits' will be better off buying the ""Got to get it on again"" album."
3,Does not fit well for bed with footboard,"The bed skirt does not allow for a bed with a footboard. I had to create a split at the corners, fold them under and hem them so I could use this with a footboard."
4,A Good Book for Young People,"I rate this book highly because without a lot of fanfare, this little book has chugged along and provided a non-judgemental reference tool for young people for a couple generations. Eric Johnson was an elementary school teacher of mine"
4,Measuring Spoons/Cups,"Nice little set of measuring devices I use regularly. I am glad to purchase anything that is for ""the cure"". God Bless"
4,Cute measuring set,"I like this set -- it's cute and convenient -- and I'm happy to buy products that support cancer research. The spoon set includes a 1.5 teaspoon, which I actually use a lot. The only complaint I have is that the name of each spoon (indicating the measured amount) have now all rubbed off, so it takes a moment to figure out which is which. I suppose I could marker them back on, but haven't yet."
5,Amazon asked me to write a review for this.,I needed a set of measuring cups and spoons. Ok so they were pink but they were breast cancer pink. I am not a metrosexual. I am closer to Homer Simpson. It is sad.Excellent quality and I recommend buying them while they are still floating around. Thank you.
3,after years of owning these...,the ink wears off so i cannot read it. the 1/2 cup is obvious (along with the full cup) but the others...now i have to buy a new set of measuring cups/spoon with engraved letters on them![...]
1,Doesn't last,"I bought a few sets of kitchen aid cups and spoons because I do a lot of baking. After a year of use, the markings on the measuring spoons has completely faded which makes it very annoying when your baking. I'm always double checking to make sure I have the right spoon. I'm replacing all my plastic with stainless, it just last longer."
3,Love the color.....,"Bought these to go with my new PINK Kitchen Aid mixer ( +++++) and I found myself alittle disappointed. The measuring sets keep coming off the ring that holds them ... and they are always falling all over the place. They measurements are only metric and although that may be politically correct, I am not familiar with the global measuring standards.The biggest dissapointment was they bent alittle when washed in the dishwasher! Top rack and since it seems to be a heavy plastic I don't think they should have done this."
4,Touring the streets of a London I've never known,"""This is a wonderful mixed collection of early music by a variety of English or London-based composers with a fair amount of melodious, dancing recorder parts. The music is playful and while you could imagine some pieces being played in front of a more educated audience, others are definately the playful music of the streets and public houses.There is a mixture of tempos, with some very lively tunes and some more complex pieces. The playing is relaxed and sometimes playful. Nice sound as well - one presto passage on a Finger composition sounds like a saxophone."
3,Alot smaller than it looks,"this package is actually much smaller than it looks. the stuff is okay but i gave it to few people for the holidays and when i paid them a visit and saw a little basket sitting on the table i thought what smuck gave this tinky thing to an entire office of 4 people. well..... i was that smuck hehe. anyways if you're planning to give it to 1 person maybe two go ahead, but don't try to please an office with it because there won't be enough to go around!"
3,Great products; not as big as it seems in photo,"I give this a 3 because it has great products in it and was the perfect ""thank you"" gift for my son's teachers. I was just a little shocked to see it was not as ""big"" as it appeared in the photo once delivered. Without any other items around it in the photo, you can't tell it's about 6-8"" wide by about 12"" tall. It was compact, and shrink wrapped, so all the items fit in the box base. This is great to ship it, but it doesn't look like a $25 gift without opening it, ""fluffing"" it up, and putting my own ribbon on it so it would look like the image shown."
1,Customer review,"I bought this gift basket thinking there was Ghirardelli chocolate (b/c the description said so), but there was no Ghirardelli."
2,thank you gift,Smaller then expected and the cookies were hard and the shortbread delectable cookies were also hard and not very tasty
3,buyer beware,"it was ok bought for wife could have been better coffee in it was bitter, the rest of it was ok the chocolate was ok but it was mostly no name companies just think a better gift basket is out there buyer beware it is cheap"
4,"Gift, so no actual experience",I sent this as a gift to a neighbor for helping remove some brush. He said it was nice and he liked it. I liked the ease of ordering and sending the gift.
3,Lots of pictures,The author emphasizes that applique uniformity doesn't have to be perfect from block-to-block. I liked the section with directions on how to design your own applique patterns from foldling and cutting paper. The author often uses just her eye to place pattern pieces with beautiful results.
5,awesome!,"This book is awesome! Great ideas and instructions for doing applique! And of course, it doesn't have to be limited to just quits!"
3,Frankly disappointing,"Well, at least the cover has a lot of character, style, and artistic merit. The album lacks distinctiveness, or maybe I'm just expecting KC to scale previous heights. Better than most albums out there, however below the standard of Lark's, Starless, or Red."
3,Seems Pretty Mediocre to Me,"Many Crimson fans seem enthralled with this album. I can't imagine why. The band has regressed to an overdriven variation on heavy metal with an especially clean sound which reminds me very much of ground already plowed by Rush decades ago.The material here kicks up dust in a few places but is mostly disappointing. I was especially sad to hear Adrian Belew writing lyrics that revisit ground others have already visited - most notably ""The Facts of Life"" which combines a title used by Talking Heads (who Belew has played with, and must have an awareness of) with a lyrical idea used best by XTC (""Across This Antheap"") and Captain Beefheart (""Ant Man Bee"") in past.I find both the music and lyrics here to cover ground already covered in past eras, and to provide little new. AT least ""Level 5"" and ""Electric"" get their teeth into things though."
4,Still the standard bearers for true progressive rock,"While the move to a more metallic approach may be in part an attempt to reach a younger audience, it is by no means a callous one: the band sounds inspired and invigorated. One suspects the power percussion of Pat Mastelloto is just more suited to a heavier style than Bill Bruford's jazzier grooves. Guitarist Adrian Belew remains Fripp's best hiring move: still providing smiles among the many shadows, and his voice sounds stronger. The usual daunting instrumental passages are some of the Crim's most interesting in years. And while the songs aren't quite at the level of the gems on Thrak (save for the cheekily witty ""Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With""), ""Eyes Wide Open"" is simply lovely. Not sequenced quite as effectively as it could have been, but still multi-dimensional listening, a rarity these days."
4,Is Crimson Repeating Itself?,I have LEVEL FIVE and HAPPY... Fripp has always said that when King Crimson music is made a group calling itself King crimson will appear. While I truly enjoy this album(much awaited after the superior LEVEL FIVE and the HAPPY... ep); I find that this album by the current Crimso's is actually an adjunct to the two cds above.It cannot be listened to and appreciated without the above context. So? Is King Crimson repeating itself? My answer is yes.This 'Industrial Jazz' field has been furrowed many times since the CONSTRUCTION OF LIGHT album. That is why I have a sneaking suspicion that this lineup of the Crim will be no more after their current tour.
1,Hard to believe,The album is by the King Crimson! Complete meanless to me!Where is the beautiful melody? Where are the profound lyrics?Nothing but trash.Can't believe it is highly rated by so many people.
1,Truly Awful,"I cannot believe this release has gotten so many positive reviews. I hate this CD. I am going to throw it away......it's that bad.I have been a fan of King Crimson for many years and have truly enjoyed some of their earlier work. What happened to that great style they used to have? Remember when they put out good music, such as Elephant Talk, Heartbeat, Three Of A Perfect Pair, Sleepless, etc.But this,..... this is pure [garbage].Don't even consider buying this. If you really want it, e-mail me and I'll send you my copy....but hurry, before I throw it in the river."
5,The Creme de la Crim,"Sure this CD has great production, great songs, great hooks, great playing and great writing. But as you listen to this fantastic CD, consider this: this band has been around for over 30 years! Name a band that has that kind of mileage and still puts out quality material. In short, King Crimson is a great band. They have become legends without having to compromise, or lose any of their current or former members to the grim reaper. Their music stands on it's own without any external marketing manipulation, unlike today's disposable video stars.At the risk of sounding like an overly zealous Dream Theater fan that praises anything the band puts out (you know who you are), this is truly a great CD!"
3,"Broke on me Halloween Night, BUT..","I wish it had been more durable! The strap broke 1/2 way through walking my son in the neighborhood on Halloween night. I got a lot of compliments on the actual wings. I think if you reinforce the straps, it is a good buy. Very very pretty wings."
2,A Boring Topic Put in the Most Boring Way,"I would recommend any book about colonial printing rather than this book. I originally bought it so I could get information on colonial broadsides but it has no information on them and the information it does have is dull and monotonous. Again, just choose another book"
2,Not really the Sonics...,"After the original line-up of the Sonics split, a band who were The Sonics only in name kept on going. This music isn't bad, it's just a far cry from the 1965-66 Sonics. So if you're after the 200 MPH, wigged out, totally rockin', brilliant Sonics, look elsewhere."
1,crap,this is crap.i love the first 3 sonics albums & this is utterly boring genero 60's rock.ignore.
5,Done it Again,Buy the damn book. It is that good. My only gripe is now I am impatient for the next one.
1,Tripe,The fact that anyone could finsh this book would be truly amazing. It would seem the author has no plot. Is he still in high school? It felt like a story a high schooler would write.
5,Erikson Delivers again,"Once again Erikson has delivered.Most authors that take on such an expansive series tend to suck after the 4th or 5th book (ex: Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, etc.) because they try to extend the series too long or lose sight of their original goal.Erikson on the other hand has defined this series as only being ten books. He has thought out each book in advance and how all the main and side characters interact leaving a breathtaking glimpse into the world he has created. If you decided to go back and chronical all interactions and time frames I am sure they would match up perfectly. A VERY well thought out series and some incredible writing."
5,"great book, as always, by this author","I love this series, but do not feel they can be read as stand alone books. But the most brilliant series ever I guess in fantasy. Wish they were on audiotape or kindle.If you like George R. R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", you will like these I believe. But it does take about 500 pages in the first book to really start to ""get it"" and like it so much.Good luck and worth trying."
1,Never again,"The Samsonite Cruisair was expensive for what it is. After several uses, the plastic latch broke. I called Samsonite - they do not have a replacement part that I can buy. I can, however, drive 50 miles to a repair center. Just say no to Samsonite!"
4,Good solid suitcase - shame about the lining,I bought two of these suitcases and have used them several time a year for 4 years. Unfortunately the fastenings on the divider broke and I had the case repaired. The repair didn't last and Samsonite gave me a full refund to buy a new case
3,"Good, but not detailed enough.","This is a decent dictionary, but it's not as good as the complete word study dictionaries. I got it for $20 and it served me well for a while, but I really don't use it anymore as it is not a complete dictionary, and there were often a few words that I couldn't find in it. It's worth the extra money for a more scholastic dictionary."
2,Less than the basic...,"This dictionary is poor indeed. To make it plain, Vine's dictionary may be simple enough to be used even by people not acquainted with the Biblical languages or the linguistic technical terms, but many times it offers enlightening information even to scholars. On the contrary, Renn's dictionary says less than the basic. To give an example, the very important article ""Create"" says nothing (!) about the use of ""qanah"" in the Old Testament. The same lemma, mentioning the word ""ktizo"" in the New Testament, says nothing about its background and its classical use. Just compare these articles with the ones of Vine, and you will understand what I mean. Hence, I would recommend this dictionary only to people who find even Vine's dictionary difficult to read."
4,Energetic live set.,"This, the first live release from OCS, is an energetic live set from the lads. It is a bit rough at times and the sound quality, while still very good, could have been better given the year it was recorded. The band is both tight and a bit loose at times. Simon Fowler's voice strains on occasion but overall they are in fine form and this disc is a great deal of fun. It is always a pleasure to listen to Steve Cradock in a live context be it with OCS or with Paul Weller. He seems to come from the George Harrison school of guitar artistry, where every note counts. Where I prefer their studio work, this is still a worthy addition to any OCS fan's collection."
4,The Setting is a Synagogue,"Wanted to correct previous poster. Story takes place in a synagogue, otherwise known as a temple. Not in a church. The holiday is Yom Kippur, the day of Atonement."
3,A terrific period piece,"Frasier's novels are always a wonderful look back in time to the 70s and early 80s. If you like Barbara Pym, you will like this. (I like both)."
5,Better than expected,"When I first felt this pad with my fingers, I doubted it would do much at all. But I was surprised. We bought this for our son's kayak seat - an older Necky with hard plastic seat. The day it arrived he had already left to go camping with Boy Scouts for the weekend. I had a huge sewing project and used it all weekend on my hard wood dining room chair. It really did work well. Again, I was totally surprised this thing worked, but it really did. My tail end didn't ache or hurt in any way after using for about 8 hours straight. My Necky kayak has a padded seat, but I think this will feel better than the padded seat and plan to order one for me too."
2,Yak pad too small. Not enough cushion,"I bought the pad to give me cushioning on my bottom and not raise my center of gravity too much. It does the second well, but minimal cushion. Look for a pad with 1"" cushion and at leat 4-5"" larger on front to back depth."
3,tolerable,pretty thin for long trips...and to expensive for the usefulness of the product...i would look for a thicker seat for improved comfort
5,Comfortable kayak Seat,Great and comfortable gel seat. Such a seat makes a big difference on our long distance paddles.KayakGuide.comPlaces to Paddle(tm)
1,Hard as a Rock,Hard as a rock. I can't imagine how this is better than the 4 dollar stadium seat I picked up last year.I'll be considering returning this item if its not too much trouble.
1,Disorganized and difficult to read,"The anatomy is explained with spacial relations of parts of the brain that have not been discussed. In some cases, the names exist only as descriptors and the location remains a mystery without another textbook. In other cases, there is a structure named with location shown in many places, but there is no description of it's function in the book. Acronyms exist without a glossary listing of them, so the only way to know the acronym is to flip back in the book until you find the location it is first used - fun for a >600 page book."
3,ok,"when I first recived this book it seemed great, it was very colorful, has many diagrams and clinical case presentations that you may see on the USMLA. However, over time, it seemed difficult to read, often mentioning a topic without having previously having discused the topic. For example the motor systems chapter is very confusing and I had to use another textbook to understand plantar reflexes and B sign. I would say get the atlas and textbook by Nolte and the text by Martin."
5,The Tracks Of Tyler Hilton,"This CD is awesome! It is one you don't want to miss out on! If you like John Mayer then you'll love Tyler Hilton! He rocks the house! I mean, don't get me wrong...John Mayer is awesome but Tyler Hilton is even better! His hit song When It Comes is really a great song. Tyler is such a nice person and his songs are so great. This is basically his debut album so even if you only know one of his songs, buy the album! I promise you'll love it!"
5,Worth it all,After listening to Tyler Hilton's new CD The Tracks Of... I know it was worth the money... He's got an incrediblely appealing voice and his tunes on guitar and paino put me in awe. Five stars all the way.
5,A Bit of Grace,"Tyler Hilton's The Tracks Of is absolutely phenomenal!This guy's voice is as smooth as gravy. He sings somewhat country and he sings it with a soulful tone. His music is just great. For those of you who haven't gone out and bought it yet, what are you waiting for? Trust me, you won't be dissapointed!"
5,an amazing disc from a hilton with real talent,"this album is amazing. it's hard to believe that tyler's not from the south with the bluesy-rock sound he produces here. the first single, 'when it comes,' is the perfect anthem for his own generation. his guitar skills are up to par, and his songwriting is very originial as well, but it's his voice that makes this album stand out. he's deep and throaty and he belts out perfect high notes as well. i definitely would share this cd with my friends, if i wasn't scared they'd keep it :)"
5,Tyler Hilton is Awesome!!!!!!!!,THis CD is great! His voice is soo incredible! Everyone should buy this CD it's soooo worth it!!
5,Tyler Hilton: An Artist you Want to Know!,"Tyler Hilton is an amazing and truely talented musician. I first met him over a year ago and received a free sample of his music and fell in love with it. When it Comes, and Rollin' Home both featured on the sample CD are tracks on The Tracks of Tyler Hilton. Tyler's voice is incredible to listen to, he writes his own lyrics, which are great. The Tracks of Tyler Hilton is a CD with songs that everyone can relate to. I recommend you buy the CD immediately, you won't be disappointed!"
5,Tyler Hilton Is Amazing,"Tyler Hilton is simply amazing. I love his CD and love him on One Tree Hill. I saw him live last night and he has a great voice and sounds exactly as he does live as he does on the CD. He is extremely talented and the single ""When It Comes"" is one of the best from anyone. Tyler Hilton is amazing!"
5,Awesome!,"I first saw Tyler Hilton on One tree hill. I listened to some of his music and loved it. My friend gave me his CD, and I'm constantly listening to it. My favorite songs are Glad and Rollin home. If you haven't already, you should go out and buy a copy of the tracks of...Katie Wisconsinprettyinpink1323@yahoo.com"
2,Disappointed,"The product said like new, and yes the cd plays, but the case was all kinds of broken and looked awful. It was suppose to be a birthday gift."
5,.:Tyler Hilton Fan:.,Hello my name is Evelina and I watch One Tree Hill everyweek an the first time i heard tyler hiltons song was on that show last week! after that i went out an bouught the cd and now thats all i listen too! That Tracks of is an awsome cd and has to be one of the best. tyler's voice is differant than most singers are an thats what gives him his uniqueness that made me fall head over heels for him! Tyler cd would make a great christmas present!
5,The Tracks of...an amazing singer/song wiriter,"Tyler Hilton's The Tracks Of...is one of the most entertaining albums I own. Every song is just as good as the other. His style sounds like a mix of John Mayer, Ryan Adams, Elvis, and The Beatles. Hes going to take the world by storm. If you don't know his name, you might want to write it down."
5,Tyler Hilton's great album,"Tyler has such a unique sound to his music, I think he is one of the greatest artists I have heard in a long time. One thing that sets him apart from the other artist is that he is an actual musician, he writes all his own music. I think one of the best things about Tyler is that he is a very nice to all his fans. At every concert he tries to meet as many fans as possible. If you ever get a chance to go to his show, you have to because you will be so impressed."
5,This CD Rocks!!,"Tyler Hilton is a rising star, about to explode in the music scene! I highly recommend this CD for its unique sound and lyrics (not to mention Tyler is extremely HOT!). Some of the best songs include: The Letter Song, Glad, Rolling Home, Pink & Black, Kiss On, and Picture Perfect (oops that's almost the whole CD!). The other amazing song on this CD is When It Comes, which you might have already heard. This talented artist writes all his own songs and with his raspy, but young sound to his music these songs are bound to be a hit! I could have this CD on repeat for days without getting sick of it!!"
5,absolutely recommended!,"well, first, i was very sceptical about buying this album... aside from hating tyler hilton's character in one tree hill, i do not have any assurance that he plays good music, but still, i gave it a try... and damn! when i listened to this CD, it was so good that i kept playing it over and over again! the songs played in this CD are soothing to the ears and heaven to the soul.. i just loved how he strammed the guitar well... and the genra of the music is really nice! it's so fun listening to this CD! favorites are glad, kiss on, insomnia... and the whole bunch of it?! promise! YOU WON'T REGRET BUYING THE CD!"
5,AWESOME CD,Tyler Hilton's cd is one of the best cd's i have heard in a long time. its a must have for any tyler fans.
5,Going to be big,"Tyler Hilton's lyrics, songs and voice is something to rave about. His style and sound is so unique it automatically sparked an interest. His songs.. original and deep. He is, without a doubt, going to be around for a long time. Perfoms wonderfully in concert (the acoustic is incredible) and on the CD. Isn't professionally fixed up. Tyler Hilton = THE REAL DEAL. - Ashlie"
5,Actually very good,"When I randomly watched an episode of one tree hill, I saw tyler but didn't think much of it. I didn't care for the character he played and didn't realize he actually had a cd out. Then I caught another episode where he played his song ""When It Comes"" and absolutely loved it. I couldn't believe it was him playing so I started searching on the internet about him. He actually wrote this song. They guy is young, but has a ton of talent. His voice is different. While others compare him to howie day and jack johnson, I say he is separate from them. His style isn't the same as theirs and I like that. His others songs have an old school mellow but rocking out feel. It's hard to explain but this is a must have cd. Cannot wait for his next cd to come out."
3,Not Bad,He's got a great voice. Reminiscent of Bryan Adams. The tracks all seem similar to me. It's a good start I guess. Doesn't make me want to run out and buy any more yet. Might have to warm up to it.A-
5,awesome!!,Tyler's music is so awesome! i can't stop listening to it. it's that amazing. it's worth buying his cd. he touched my heart with his music.
5,amazing artist,Tyler Hilton is an amazing rising star. His sound is unlike any other which draws many fans to him. This album is really good and you should definately check it out!
5,a review of tyler hilton by a fan...,"This is an amazing cd that I have had now for a long time. It is one of my all time favorites and I listen to it almost everyday. Tyler has an incredibly soulful voice that is accompanied by amazing guitar playing that makes the cd worth every penny you spent. I highly recommend the tracks of Tyler Hilton, so go and pick it up."
4,We liked it,"My boys have been big fans of the original Nate the Great book. This isn't quite a much fun as the original, but we liked it."
5,Magnificent!,"High-end ashtrays are somewhat difficult to find. Cartier only offers one, and it's sized for cigars. This ashtray is stunning. Bear in mind that it's almost 6.5 lbs. of crystal, so it's not conveniently portable. The price I paid on Amazon was a bargain."
3,Colonial Slavery Biography Worth Reading,"This book was won the 1951 Newbery Medal and I think writing styles have really changed since then. This book is written an omniscient POV which I didn't like. But it is a biography worthy of being told and worthy of being read. The story of Amos' journey as a young African prince captured in 1725 and sold into slavery, taught to be a tanner, and eventually given his freedom where he continued to ply his trade to provide for his family. It is a touching, inspiring story of triumph and the way it is written provides a good glimpse into the Colonial period."
3,Amos fortune Free Man Highlights and low lights,"This book was a good book. I am using such a simple adjective because I don't think that it was disappointing but I don't think it deserves anything better. It was enjoyable because it does give you some perception on slavery but it is too smoothed over to give it any great thought or detail. The author skips a lot of the story as in (spoiler alert) when he marries the first two women, Lily and Lydia Kate Evergreen doesn't get into his emotion or feelings. We (the readers) don't even know if he was upset! He is also sold originally to a Quaker who is extremely forgiving and offers his freedom during the first years. This is not at all how slavery was. in fact, it was extremely rare to be sold to such a kind man. When the owner (Mr. Copeland) dies, he is put up for auction again and is sold for 62 pounds and is again sold to a nice man and is freed in four years. I wish it wasn't as candy-coated and was a little more realistic."
2,Okay,"This book captures the life of an African prince named At-Mun. At the beggining of the book his father gets killed and his tribe gets enslaved. The slave-ship sails of without his cripple sister whose only twelve years old.During his time in slavery At-Mun he physically treated badly. He is sold twice, once right before he was to be freed. Every chance he gets he tries to find his sister.Upon his eventual emancipation, he buys a slave to free and marry her. Then he sets up his own tannery and starts a family.Overall, this non-fiction about slavery and separation evokes satisfaction. But does he find his sister? Read and find out!"
2,More Boring Than I Thought,"As with most other kids I thought this book was not worth writing. While reading the description it sounded fantasticly exciting. In the beginning it actually sounded like an interesting piece of history. By the end it was one of the most boring books I've ever read. Now I have come to realize that just because a book wins the Newbery Medal does not mean that it is a good book. With 1,000 good books one book can be published because it is pollitically correct or is spewed out by a good author. I have no doubts about Elizabeth Yates but I think that Amos Fortune is a book about a man that had a good life, but one that was not nessicarily worth writing about."
2,kinda good,"this book was not the best. Some parts where exciting, but most of the book was boring. I would not recamend this to a younger kid because it has some big words."
5,Research Project on Slavery,"If you did a research project on slavery, I think you found the right book. You will learn about how slaves were treated and what they became."
4,Fortunate enough to have read this book,"This book is about a young African prince who is captured and brought to America and sold as a slave. Amos is somewhat fortunate because his new ""family"" teaches him to read and speak the English language. Elizabeth Yates takes you through Amos's fortunes and misfortunes. You will not want to put this book down."
4,A man who led the way for others,"Amos Fortune was born At-mun, the son of a king in Africa. Before he knew it, he was seized and taken to America, to be sold as a slave. He was fortunate, however, and was sold to a kind Quaker who treated him justly and beneficently and allowed him to buy his freedom. All his life (and he lived a long life, living to nearly one hundred) Amos helped others become free, including all three of his wives.With a copyright date of 1950, I anticipated there would be lots of racist elements to this book. There were, but the book was redeemed somewhat by the depiction of Amos as a pioneer, a good man, a man who led the way for others."
3,Amos Fortune Free Man,"This book was a bit slow starting but then picked up towards the middle and end (so much that I wish it hadn't of stopped.) Even though the print and layout of book seemed kind of juvenile it's content and vocabulary was fitting for up to a 14 or 15 year old.Definitely a different type of ""slavery"" book; Fortune was one that we as a society should know more about. Elizabeth Yates' book made me want to learn more about the man, Amos Fortune.I would recommend this book to any age level."
5,Not so boring.,Quite contrary to other peoples opinions on this book I found it engaging rather than boring. The main character (Amos) is an example good of patience. It is well written and an excellent book.
2,Outdated and not very helpful,"As several other reviewers have mentioned, there are numerous faults with this book: the Persian font is too small and cramped, the dictionary is not comprehensive, and the lessons do not necessarily proceed in the most logical fashion (e.g., why do we learn inseparable pronouns before we learn actual pronouns). Moreover, this book suffers from having a non-native author. As someone else mentioned, there are quite a few grammatical errors, or usage of the wrong, or lesser used preposition.The books merits, though, are the careful explanation of how to make the Persian letters. It is also somewhat useful if you have learned Farsi in the classroom, and need some backup as to certain rules (such as how to form plurals). But for the beginner, I'd recommend the Lonely Planet guidebook as a more comprehensive and easier introduction."
1,Don't Buy,For people who do not know how to read the persian alphabet this is a horrible book!!! The persian letters are entirely illegible!!! Waste of money. The letters are smaller than any type print I've ever seen.
5,An excellent presentation of the Persian alphabet,"Mace does an excellent job of teaching the Persian alphabet. It is worth buying the book just for the alphabet exercises. The correct name of the national language of Iran is Persian. The word ""Farsi"" is the Persian translation of the word ""Persian."" Just like we say ""French"" in English and not ""Francais,"" we say ""Persian"" in English and not ""Farsi."""
3,OK for introduction but better texts available,I am a student and non-native speaker of Persian language. The book is ok to get started but check out these two texts which are far superior:A Practical Guide to the Persian Alphabet - Ahmad JabbariA Persian Reader. Book One- LilyThe problem with this book and many other Persian language books is that they assume some knowledge of Farsi and provide little hands on practice and explanation. This is sad way to learn a newlanguage.
4,A good book,"Teach yourself modern Persian by John Mace is a good book for beginners. The book is divided in two parts: Alphabet and Grammar. If you're totally new to Persian the alphabet part is good, otherwise you can skip it. The grammar part is not bad, but some of the grammar is a little old fashioned. If you work through this book, you will have a good basis for learning more Persian. For learning words and phrases faster and easier, I've found this program to be very useful: PersianHelper, which can be found at [web address] 'Colloquial Persian' by Rafiee is a better book if you want to learn a language that is a little more up to date."
5,Useful and Thorough,"This book is particularly useful for two reasons. First is that it does an excellent job in teaching the Arabic script. I picked it up in a little more than a week. The rest of the book reinforces this, as well as both grammar and vocabulary. Very, very useful."
2,Not a good idea!,"This book does a decent job of teaching the Persian alphabet in that it takes you through, letter by letter, so that you learn slowly and thoroughly as you go along. However, the Persian characters are actually printed in such a way that they're difficult to see!Also, a lot of the sample sentences grammar points and sample sentences Mace provides are grammatically incorrect Persian! Not a good book to start learning from."
3,"Good, easy book, with a few problems","Okay, the good points. This book proceeds in a good, logical manner, with plenty of attention to each different subject. The dialogues are useful, and are not ridiculously difficult to learn. The alphabet is explained very well. Overall, it's a very useful and enjoyable intro to Farsi.There are three problems with this book: the text size is VERY small, making it very difficult to see how the letters are formed. Secondly, the organization of the vocabulary before each text does not proceed logically, nor does it include the appropriate words for the lesson. Finally, the language presented here is the formal, written language, and spoken Farsi really varies drastically from this. (For example, most Persians cut some syllables out of words)"
2,Wild Romp,"I was disappointed in this kit I bought for my grandson, while watching him play with it the key directional magnet broke. It was attached only by a thin thread of a wire. He was using it as it was supposed to be used, it worked for only a couple hours after being put together. Now we are trying to fix it so it can be used again."
2,Fun With Magnets,"If your kid likes throwing things, this toy is perfect. The magnets are a perfect size to be thrown by little hands. The pendulum thingy is made of cheap plastic, but I gave this toy two stars because it must've been delicious, as it was the first thing our puppy chewed up. Metal base came bent, so, we never actually got to enjoy this toy for its actual functions. This thing was a stocking stuffer, not a main attraction, but I wouldn't buy this again. Not even as a gift for a family that I hated..."
2,Not interesting for long,"The R.O.M.P. has been a disappointing purchase. I don't recommend it. My 12 yr old daughter had a Newton's CradleNewtons Cradle - Largethat she loved. It was endlessly fascinating to her to drop the ball and watch it seem to ricochet off both sides. When the cradle finally broke, I thought I would find something different, yet similar. That is why I bought the R.O.M.P. The R.O.M.P does what it was advertised to do, but unfortunately it turns out that this is only (mildly) interesting the first time you see it. This isn't the sort of toy/device/equipment that you will find yourself playing with days later and then again days after that. Note that the pendulum is a pendulum-like; as on a grandfather clock, it is straight and stiff, not flexible like a string or a chain. I don't know why but I think that it is something about the pendulum's straight stiffness (as opposed to the flexibility of a string) that makes this toy less arresting than it might be."
3,Fun in the office- once set up,"I was very excited of the potential of the ROMP when i place my order. when i recieved it though, i spent a hour trying to force the screw into through the platform and into the plastic L. the best way i can describe it was trying to force a square peg into a round hole.I purchased this amazing ROMP to set up in my new office space, for passerbys to have something to fidget with. in that sense, the ROMP was a huge sucess. co-workers and guests would sometimes spend 20-30 minutes to try and get the pendulum to stay in motion by playing with the bottom magnets.One major gripe would be that after a month, the glue to the swinging magnet wore off and would frequently fall off. it is sort of a dissapointment but it was also amusing to see people still try and play with it- even though there wasnt a magnet on the top.overall i think the ROMP is a fun and interesting office toy for the money."
5,Magnetically Stimulating,"The Hog Wild ROMP is so much fun. Watching the random movements of the pendulum is very stimulating. I love to change the positions of the magnets and try different polarities. The base is solidly constructed, and the magnets are robust. The mounted arm is a plastic material, (I wish this was metal, but it should last as long as you are careful). The pendulum is plastic too, but this is OK because it needs to be light enough to move around. I also find that the plastic pendulum will flex a little, which is fun when playing with the attractive nature of the magnets. Overall, this is a great gift for anyone."
4,Disco Is the Last Thing I Would Call This Chick,"I love this CD. All these years all I thought she had to offer was Pull Up to the Bumper. I play this CD all the time. Pull Up is probably my least favorite now. Guess that makes me weird for ""getting it"". I know my neighbors hate me but who gives a fcuk.I thought Kelis and Andre 3000 were out there some cosmic trip. They're mere schoolkids still playing in the sandbox compared to Grace.Makes me wonder how come she never hooked up with Prince or Rick James or Bootsy Collins during the late 70's/early 80's. But them again maybe Grace wasn't trying to be down with any particular camp or boxed into one sound. Too bad her imagery overshadowed the sheer magnitude of the songs had during their original releases. But I can definitely appreciate her contribution to the music industry now.Would love to see a serious DVD collection of her music videos and live performances. That ish would definitely win a special Grammy."
5,awesome,i seen this same tower in crate and barrel for 300+ $....and gotit for 149.00 with free 2day shipping ...u cant beat it ....ez to put together...i love it
4,Winsome Wine Tower,"Overall, an okay product. It is solid and looks good in our dining room. The color is almost like a dark cherry. It takes up very little space, but provides a lot of storage space. The negatives, it took a friend and I almost four hours to put together (and normally, I don't have a problem with these things). The biggest problem, besides the directions were almost non-existent, the drawer was almost impossible to get screws into. I had to repeatedly re-drill the holes and line them up. If you can get it for a reasonable price, go for it. It is not going to be a super high quality product. But it is much higher quality than particle board furniture pieces."
1,Awful,"This was the worst piece of furniture I have ever purchased. I recently moved into a new condo and had to buy all new furniture and this was the only item I had a problem with. The wood was warped, the screw holes were not aligned properly and the pieces just did not fit where they were suppose to go. A complete disappointment."
5,Storage with Style,My wife and I love this wine rack. It has a great look and style. It fits right in with our furniture. We have had many comments on it. The selling company was great and the project came quickly.
3,Acceptable,It's black with shades of red as others have mentioned. I have to return the top because it was dented in several areas. Will update to discuss replacement and customer service experience.
