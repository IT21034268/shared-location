4,Great Work by a Great Scholar,"I have been reading about India in an amateurish way for years, but no single work has a greater feel for the subject than this book.In particular, I enjoyed his courage. Most scholars timidly suggest that Jainism began in the time of Mahavira, but this author boldly asserts the antiquity of the Jain way."
4,"Half indological, half spiritual","Heinrich Zimmer: Very knowledgable indologist. The book: Presenting hinduism, buddhism and tantrism in a colloquial way. Main weight is on hinduism which is presented according to the kama, artha, dharma, moksha pattern. The tendency is to eulogize hinduism, which is not typical for an indologist. The author has a good writing style and shows a lot of his knowledge in this book. He could not finish the book during his lifetime, so the part about tantrism had to be completed according to his notes by others. If someone does not like vedanta, the book may seem to be onesided to him. For me, this was just the right side."
5,The Greatest Cast Album Of All,"Of the two cast recordings of Sunset Boulevard available, this original version got it right the first time. There is a perfect flow and rhythm. In particular, ""The Lady's Paying"" is much tighter here than in the Glenn Close recording, which screws with the momentum by adding a couple of humor changes that are unnecessary and do not add to the enjoyment of the song. Patti LuPone is spectacular, sad and maddening. The first act CD is cut just perfect. A perfect blend of song, lyric, and book."
3,sunset boulevard,"Great cd. just a shame it took so long to get to me....however when i wrote in, amazon customer services did rectify this and get the product to me in a matter of days.... thanks Amazon."
4,"Golden ""Sunset""","With the revival of ""Sunset Blvd."" making it's way through London, and prominent talk once again of making a movie of this musical, I thought it was time to revist ""Sunset Blvd."", by way of its soundtracks. The 'World Premiere' recording is, by far, the best. LuPone can send chills down your spine with her magnificent vocals; drawing her audience into the fantasy world that defines Norma Desmond, without losing her importance or reducing her to 'comic relief'. Her supporting cast can hold their own against her, with a stand-out performance by Anderson, who brings the right ammount of innocence and deviousness (with a touch of wit and sarcasm) to his vocal performance. The only flaw is the edited version of the soundtrack. Unlike its American Premiere counterpart, the songs are not sung in their full length, while most of the dialogue has been scrapped , giving the sense that the whole project was rushed through."
2,A questionable cast spoiling a not-quite-there-yet score.,"I very much enjoyed the American version of Sunset Blvd., but the original London version doesn't do much for me. It contains the original (and no longer current) versions of many of the songs, leaving the material with a ""score"" lacking the polish it received when it arrived in America. There are, however, subtle but tantalizing hints of what the show would eventually become. But it is the cast that is the reason to not buy this 2-disc set. Unless you want to hear Kevin Anderson trying to act and sing at the same time, Daniel Benzali sing a role in the wrong range, and Patti LuPone miscast more than just any other actress in musical theatre history, skip it and buy the far superior Glenn Close/Alan Campbell version instead."
4,One Of Webber's Better Scores,"As with most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals, the orchestrations are extremely good, with an excellent cast (esp. Ms. Lupone) & memorable songs.Top tracks include:With One LookThe Greatest Star Of AllThe Perfect YearSunset BoulevardAs If We Never Said GoodbyeThese are great songs & this musical could have rivaled ""Phantom Of The Opera"", however, Mr. Webber limits the show to only a few songs, which are ""reprised"" throughtout the production.Great songs ... just wish there were are couple more!"
4,"Great Musical, Great Recording!","I recommend that anyone who hasn't heard Sunset Boulevard should go out and buy themselves a copy of this recording today. The performers are well cast, and I found that they were, vocally and dramatically, far superior than their American Premiere Recording counterparts. Patti Lupone as Norma Desmond has an amazing voice (much stronger than Glenn Close's) and believable acting. The orchestrations are beautifully done; my only problem with this recording is that the end of the final scene was cut, while it wasn't on the APR."
1,You sent the wrong product,"you sent an identidal Flipper to the Right handed one. I definitely ordered one of each. the order said ""left-handed"" and you sent the wrong one."
5,Works Great!,I bought this for my son is a gift because he likes to grill a lot and I saw it being used on a TV show. I asked him how he liked it and he said it works great!
2,Weird Movie,"This movie certainly has great actors in it, and they did a good performance, but I didn't really care for the story. I would not recommend this movie too highly. I would be interested to read the story it came from.Agnes of God"
2,A failure in many respects,"Jane Fonda, whom I respect highly as an actress, cannot save this dud. Neither the score nor the cinematography is memorable. Many scenes revolve around the fact that Dr. Livingstone is a smoker, which is a very flimsy hook upon which to hang a film. This film did not hold my interest--at several points I was consciously bored and had to exert will-power to finish watching it. Moreover, the views of psychiatric practice and hypnosis are wholly unrealistic. It seems this film could not decide what to be, and certainly lacked the courage to demythologize its subject."
5,3 great actresess carry this movie!,The 3 actresses made this movie believeable. Tense drama and a glimpse at the way things actually run in a Nun's life make this a fantastic movie. Worth seeing again.
1,Not Vintage MacLean,"This is the weakest book of his I have read, and that is about thirty MacLean novels. I understand that he passed away prior to this book being published and that is was compiled posthumously. While admittedly not all of his books are great, I don't feel this is up to snuff with any of the others. Don't make this your first MacLean book and unless you feel the desire to read every one of his books like I choose to, take a pass on it. I am unwilling to touch any of the Alistair MacNeill books written using MacLeans notecards because I feel those are apt to be pretty weak too, and no one ever seems to duplicate the originals. If you are going to give a couple of MacLean novels a try, go for ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""Puppet on a Chain"", ""Bear Island"", & ""Ice Station Zebra""."
4,Betrayal by Force,"Major Peter Petersen is sent to deliver a message in Alistair MacLean's PARTISANS, but suspicion is the vital element that insures survival in the deadly game of espionage during any war. The questions is who is being set-up and for what reason, but then who is connect to whom by what ties.MacLean delivers an excellent adventure where Petersen is never sure until the last chapter who he can trust and who has more than life at stake.A good read at any time.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
1,Strange !!!,"For a novel about a very dirty, ugly conflict in WWII - this book is strangely woven with a humorous thread. It could have been so much more - oh well. Not recommended. Read Circus or Guns."
4,More than just a basketball book,"The book was mostly appealling to me because of my love for Carolina basketball. However, the novel would be interesting to any basketball lover in that of the genius behind Dean's coaching strategies. He also sets a great standard for morals that a person should have in life. The book DOES travel into other sectors of life rather than just basketball. Dean Smith provides an excellent role model as his character is nothing less than the fine aspects of discipline, church, and honesty."
1,Chronological yet disjointed,"The book cover states ""with warmth, humor, and unflinching candor, he gives readers the best seat in the house...."" If you are expecting any of that you will be disappointed...there are no warm fuzzies, it is not funny, and maybe not so sincere. This book does provide a wordy chronological history of over 30 years of Tarheel basketball....blah, blah, blah."
2,Strictly for Tar Heel Fans!,"This is a year by year by year by year (!) review of Tar Heel basketball with Dean's life prior to Carolina thrown in for good measure.(He actually had one). It makes no effort to be balanced. You see, Dean never made a mistake, had a player who flunked out or got in trouble-ever! Down in Chapel Hill, life goes on and the Heels keep winning. Phooey! I'll take Bobby Knight throwing chairs and tantrums anyday. However, if you're from Carolina or a UNC alum, ignore this review and buy the book right away. You'll never notice the shortcomings. Now, how about a bio of Dean's predecessor and mentor, Frank McGuire.(He first hired Dean as an assistant). That would be a story."
1,I could wretch,This book is boring and Dean fancies himself a martyr. I don't need to read another book about someone who believes that Jesus cares about a sporting event....yuck.
5,great service,"fits my superjet perfectly! it is a little big for my kawasaki, but will still work fine. company emailed me promptly with updates about my package a+ service. decent shipping. overall very pleased!"
3,The Frontier in American History,"This book provides a reasonable perspective of the attitudes regarding the frontier in an expanding United States. Vestiges of these attitudes can be seen today with regard to areas of scientific exploration. The prose is a little dry, but the research done by the author seems solid."
1,Dated material,Not what I expected from a history book very dry and extremely dated. I SHOULD have looked more closely at publication date.
4,Slightly misleading,The prodoct works as expected. The only negative for this is that the color is not what I expected. The seller advertised it as blue yet it came in the drab silvergrey. Honesty is best.
1,Horrible waste of time,This book by far was very disappointing. Three quarters the way through it gave u a dictionary.....What the heck.......then that was it...it ended like that!!! By far very disappointing read.
3,Smaller than I thought,"I used this for a ceramic class. The pockets were good for holding tools and I loved the color. The apron was smaller than I expected it to be in terms of length. I was expecting something that went a bit above my knees but at most it covered my upper and mid-section only, leaving my inner thigh exposed to the clay. It wasn't really a big deal but people who are taller may want to consider something else."
4,Like it~,"Like it, and it help me to cook avoiding the splashing oil.But I still feel it to be a little bit expensive. It would be even better if the neck tie is shorter."
4,Very nice little apron!,"I bought several of these aprons in white and our craft group painted on them. The fabric is a nice weight, not too heavy, but neither flimsy. I would like it if the bib were a little wider, but it suffices. We are using them to protect clothing as we craft. They took the paint nicely and look very cute! You certainly can't beat the price."
4,Petite chef - perfect apron,"Loves it, especially the pockets for various kitchen tools. Nicely constructed. Gets a bit wrinkley after a wash and dry."
3,nice gift for teenager,"Nice quality overall. Wish was little longer and wish came in size larger, for the size 13 plus teenager. But was a nice present to go with the other Lakers gear."
4,Entrances young children who will listen over and over.,"A mix of humor, suspense, and happy endings, these folk tales are entertaining for all ages. Sharon Kennedy's voice conveys perfectly the action in the story, and the listener's mind conjures up images as if reading from a picture book. We are transported to the Irish countryside with its bogs, hills, and windy roads - the perfect locale for wizards, leprechauns, and talking animals! My two preschoolers beg to hear these tales over and over, and I gladly comply as I've not tired of them yet either."
5,Dreamy Listening,"We have long loved Sharon Kennedy's stories... from the time we first heard her read in Providence, RI about 10 years ago. Our CDs are scratched and our kids were so happy to see we could download them!"
4,A pleasant reading,"I enjoyed this book a lot. Zadie Smith is a young,sophisticated voice in the otherwise plain landscape of new writers. This book is not exceptional, but it is outstanding in the subtelty the author employs when discussing the complex realities of race and academia. I don't think this will be the author's best (I personally found White Teeth to be an even more rewarding reading), but it is definitely book worthy of a reader's time."
2,Disappointing,"I read ""On Beauty"" based on its favorable reviews and my fondness for ""White Teeth."" However, I was disappointed to find ""On Beauty"" a shallow and immature book with underdeveloped characters. Equally bothering to me is the cultural context, which does not ring true. I have lived in the Boston area most of my life and am an academic. Smith's knowledge of Boston is slight and removed, while her perception of academia is that of a student. In addition, she has a weak grasp of American English. These problems combined to destroy this reader's ""willing suspension of disbelief."""
2,No more books about writers.,"I am tired of books about writers. I'm more tired of books about academics and universities. I give a free pass to Nabokov and that's it. This is purported to have such a great ear for language and move so seamlessly between these different races and classes and I didn't buy a bit of it. It lost me for good at the scene at the spoken word/poetry jam. Ultimately this could turn out to actually represent reality but I certainly hope I would never know about it. Goofy. The snarky Haitian guy, what? Maybe literature is becoming so narrowly focused that it's just writers writing for writers and reviewers (being writers) getting all fired up but it's getting lost on me."
3,Story of Contrasts,"This is the story of two families, the Belseys and the Kipps. One based in London, the other in the States. One conservative and Christian and the other liberal and 'god-aversive'. The patriachs of each family are academics and take opposing views on artworks of Rembrant resulting in an 'academic fight' that encroaches on other areas of college life and is further intensified when their families become entwined through relationships between their children and wives.The story is not only about the obvious clashes in viewpoint but a close examination of academia - the high morals, competitiveness, a critique of sorts of the meritocracy and the strange closeted environment of colleges.Initially I found the story slow and was wondering what was the point, but the story really hits a home run in the last quarter."
3,over--hyped,"I am not sure at all why this book became as hyped as it did, but I can't agree with the over-assessment of it. There is much talent here, and an energetic cast of characters but it strikes me as false, and lacks alot of depth. Perhaps I am wrong, but I just couldn't understand why it was lauded. Smith seems to stay on the surface and this is always interesting and lively, but it isn't a work of literary brilliance, though highly entertaining (which is alot in itself). I wouldn't have minded if it had just been noted as such."
2,Disappointed,"After reading White Teeth I was expecting this novel to be of the same calibre, sadly it is not. The plot is very jerky and the characters are under developed. The idea for the novel is good but it does not hang together well. White Teeth's weakness was it's ending and I think this novel has the same weakness or more so, a novel that seems to go nowhere, shame as it had so much potential."
2,Barely OK,"This is not a great book. Certainly don't rush to buy it on hard cover. The plot is somewhat disheveled, although some of the characters are well drawn. The most annoying thing about it is that Smith fails to understand and hence accurately render the African-American adolescents she depicts. Their language sounds constructed and forced. The prose also gets profuse at times. I don't recommend it. Buy Ishiguro's book, _Never Let Me Go_ instead."
2,Over-hyped,"I rushed out to buy this book based upon the terrific reviews it received, especially from the New York Times (both Sunday and daily editions). And I loved White Teeth. But this book absolutely made me cringe. I must admit I was unable to get past the first 150 pages. To get that far required a major amount of willpower... I kept waiting for it to get better, which it didn't.The portraits are so self-conscious and false. Not a single character rang even halfway true to me. And the dialogue...so phony that the author's not especially skilled hand, was evident everywhere. If the author thinks she understands the United States, even New England...she is wrong. One year at the Radcliffe Institute does not, obviously, an expert make.An homage to Forster's Howard End...I think not."
1,Don't bother,"Just don't bother.It's seldom I quit reading a book I've started, but I wish I had quit trying on this one.Cartoon characters, no depth. Plot? Are you joking?Don't bother, really."
1,Regrets,"I really regret that I actually brought the book, If you want to read it I suggest getting it from the library but even then I wouldn't waste my time, the book has some moments but all the characters are very flat and one-dimentional. Also they were very unbelievable and I couldn't warm to any of them and I don't know why this book is so long Smith could have cut the story in half and it would have still had the same effect- emptiness. Overall I found the book shallow and too try hard."
4,On Beauty,"This is a truly wonderful book. Informative with regard to mixed race families, univeristy life, women and their weight as well as men and their unfaithful hearts.I was not expecting to enjoy this book as much as I did.Unabridged on CD was wonderfully narrated."
3,OK book but please stop mis-interpreting Forster!,"The book has nice prose passages, especially when the siblings are interacting. Other than that ...I'm impressed by Smith's knowledgeable treatment of Rembrandt, although the relation between art and reality as illustrated by the lives of the two families is a bit obscure and feels forced at the end.Now that I've dispensed with the book itself, I have a plea to everyone who has been mis-using the Forster quote ""Only connect"". Read the quote --it is not about communication, but self-integration. ""Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer. Only connect, and the beast and the monk, robbed of the isolation that is life to either, will die.""Sorry to be nitpicky, but it is one of the great quotes of all time and it makes me sad that so few people understand it."
2,so bad i had to give up after just 50 or so pages,I cannot believe this book was nominated for a prize. I had to leave this book after giving it a few chances - it was just babbling and pointless.
2,Pointless and disappointing,"Considering the awards it won, this should be a great book, but I found it very unengaging. The author sets up any number of interesting subplots (son of H is about to wed daughter of M, his arch enemy; K gets cheated out of inheriting a valuable painting by her deceased friend's family) but all these conflicts somehow just evaporate. Considering that the first 200 pages of the book are the setup, and the second 200 are one expectation after another thwarted on the part of the reader, this makes for very disappointing reading. Add to that that every character manages to lose our sympathy the second they gain it (K and C seem to become friends, even though every single recorded conversation contains snubs and misunderstandings) and I had the hardest figuring why I should care about any of them."
1,On Boredom,"This was the first book I read by Zadie Smith. The hype around this young author and the mixed feelings reflected and expressed by most reviewers triggered my curiosity. So I started reading it with a sense of anticipation, however I was disappointed almost immediately.I think the story and all the characters in it are poorly developed. I always finish a book that I've started, even when I don't like it much, but I must admit that this was the first time ever that I really struggled to get to the end, it was so boring it often became soporific. It was a relief to turn the last page.On a more positive note, I do believe that the prose was very good and the style original. That's the only reason why I gave it 1 star. And that's also the reason why I'm going to give this author a second chance and shall read White Teeth soon."
3,I don't know...,"Don't let the title mislead you... The book is indeed about beauty, but also about contradictions, love, cheating, family. Two completely different men, one liberal the other conservative. Their families. But are they really so different? A book not boring at all and that, in the end, really is 'on beauty'."
4,One of Zadie's Best,"Zadie Smith's 'On Beauty' is beautifully written with a compelling plot. She once again tackles the portrayal of an intercultural family, as in White Teeth, however this time the action is largely situated in Boston, though occasionally drifts back to London. The novel confronts everything that White Teeth attempted to do (underwrites the importance and normative value of intercultural/racial families in our society, confronts racist tendencies in our communities and selves and wrestles with the qualifiers of identity) without the overwhelmingly broad set of characters and plot points. This time around, Smith narrows down her focus which enables her to reinforce the plot in an articulate and convincing way.Loved it!"
1,Forced and Unbelievable,"The characters felt fake and forced. I think the author harped too much on ethnicity. It didnt seem to be a major them, but he just kept going about it. Also it really failed to keep my attention. There was really no point to it."
3,Unjustified Fanfare,"The critics gushed over this one. While it is well-written, I couldn't help wondering why it was written."
2,Don't fall for the hype.,"From the accompanying reviews, I'm glad to see that I'm not the only person ""On Beauty"" left cold. The starred reviews! The alleged play on ""Howard's End""! What are these reviewers falling for? The book did not engage me and I couldn't be bothered to finish. If the novel had been set in England, Zadie Smith might have better understood the types she was writing about. As it is, little rings true in ""On Beauty"". Ignore the fuss and read something else."
2,Pointless,"The story is weak and the characters meaningless. I never reached a point where I could relate to or sympathize with any of the characters. The story never really developed, it just seemed to wander without direction. Though Smith made a worthy effort to tie together multiple social issues, inter-racial relationships, contrasting classes and personal family/spousal conflict, she failed in the end. The book falls flat."
4,I'm a new fan!,"This is my first Zadie Smith read, one of my book club picks. It's very different from the books I usually enjoy, but I found myself drawn into the story. If it had a better ending I would have rated it a five star. All in all, however. it is well worth the time and I recommend it wholeheartedly."
1,Not Very Good At All,"I can't believe this book got any good reviews. It is just plain awful. It looks like something that went from first draft to publishing with no editorial review in between. Her characterization of Americans and American speech patterns is ridiculous and quite annoying. Her American characters are caricatures -- for example why is Kiki obese? Oh, because women of color just get obese when they get older, no reason, no explanation, no delving into her character to understand why a sexy, happily-married woman would just balloon up to an unhealthy fatness. I really loved White Teeth. Ms. Smith should stick to writing about English people and their ways, and leave us alone.Finally, many of the newspaper reviewers talked about Howard's End and how it's such a reflection on it, etc. I didn't read Howards' End, so sorry, if that is what it takes to appreciate the book, than there should be something on the cover that says, ""make sure you read Howard's End first."""
1,one star too many,This claptrap would have never been published had the author not been black and female.
2,Underwhelmed,"Truly, I wanted to read this book. I tend toward more non-fiction and had asked my manager at work for a recommendation - she passed along this book. I found it difficult to get into - though I did like some of the characterizations (ie, fall leaving and slamming the door on the way out) - it just overall seemed like her writing wasn't very well integrated - in terms of the style(s) of writing in the book and the uneven development of characters.I found the way the characters spoke to be distractingly unnatural - and found found the oblique physical descriptions of people (explicit for some characters, almost soft porn - and very vague for others) difficult to hook into. The drama and the sub plots - just not all worked out very well and in the end - not that interesting. I forced myself to finish it in the hopes it would improve - not sure I would bother with another of her books."
2,Wouldn't have been published if she were not already famous.,"Zadie Smith has talent, but this book is lacking as a novel and would not have been published if the same work was delivered by an unknown author. The lack of a story is pathetic. The character development is rather good, but there's literally no story, beyond reading about a sad family going through a hard time. Do not waste your time."
2,has potential,"Why did Howard and Kiki ever get married? How did all of their children go such different ways? Why, after 443 pages, do I not know or care? Zadie Smith has written some beautiful passages, surrounded by flat characters. Phew, and not to mention the unending snippets of sociopolitical commentary she drags us through without ever getting to a point, or a compelling concept."
3,Boring and predictable for the well-read reader,"I grant that Zadie Smith can write an evocative scene, or describe a setting well. But this skill does not an engaging story make.On Beauty sets out to examine the issues which divide men and women, parents and children, husbands and wives, Old World (UK) and New World (US), and academe and reality. Given the huge number of books which have tackled all or some of these subjects already, a great onus is placed upon the author to deliver a unique insight or two, and here Smith fails.Perhaps Smith could learn from her brilliant contemporary, Kate Atkinson, who can pull an engaging plot and lovely prose together while engaing us intellectually.Smith also incorporates some of her poet-husband's work in this book, which I found a tad precious. As well as a crude attempt to boost his sales.I keep reading rave reviews of Smith's work, so I keep reading her books, but this may be the last. Somehow I am missing whatever the raves are about."
3,disappointing,"It surprises me that Zadie Smith was a contender for the Booker Prize with this novel. It struck me as structurally similar to her earlier White Teeth, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The structure of the two parallel families is the same, the multicultural aspects of exile/mixed marriage/mixed races are the same, only that Smith now transports most of the plot to Massachusetts. I don't think she has the same cultural understanding of the US as she has of England (and as she showed in White Teeth). The worst really is to read American teenagers, however educated and academic they may be, asking for ""favours"". English spelling does no favor to her portrait of hip-hop culture, which seems to be limited to one of the characters' use of ""scene"" anyway. In short, Smith's characters are a bit culturally superficial; she makes up for it with lively descriptions of the characters' inner lives, but somehow that is also so much like White Teeth. All in all, I am disappointed."
5,'On Beauty' is Beautiful,"Zadie Smith takes the English language and weaves a tapestry of prose to be marveled at. This is one of the most down to earth, insightful and just plain entertaining books I have read in many years.Some books are best read during a specific season or time in your life. this is an anytime read. You won't be disappointed."
2,Disapointing read,"I first spotted this book when it was released in hardcover and was excited about it. I LOVED her novel White Teeth and was impressed by the glowing reviews of On Beauty. Once it came out in paperback, I scooped it up. My first impression was not a good one. The dialouge in the beginning was flat, boring and often times confusing. But I trudged on, hoping that it would be another Zadie Smith gem. It never got any better. The characters were dull, annoying and stereotypical. The plotline was never interesting. All in all, i was very disapointed. Zadie Smith is usually a brilliant writer and that is the only reason I forced myself to make it through the book, months later. A good book usually takes me about 3 days. If you haven't read White Teeth, get that instead.White Teeth: A Novel"
2,trite and self indulgent,"Our book club read it with disbelief and puzzlement: why the universal critical acclaim? The writing is stilted, the story tedious and plot absurd: all in all I couldn't care too much about any of the characters. If anything, it is similar to her meandering horrible first book."
3,"A nice vacation read, but I was ready for it to be done....","I've read Howard's End a few times and think it far superior to this book. However, On Beauty was a nice read during my recent Mexican cruise. I thought there were some interesting parallels to Forester's book, and I enjoyed the descriptions of the politics that goes on with professors at a liberal arts college. However, I didn't really care about any of the characters that much, and found most of them shallow and annoying. I'm not sure if I'll be willing to invest much time in another book by this author in the future."
4,Good grasp of developmental issues,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Coming to it from a background as an academic whose area is developmental issues across the lifespan, I found her depiction of the individual characters insightful and sympathetic."
2,"Had high hopes, but...","After hearing several people suggest that this was indeed a good book, I made the purchase. This certainly wasn't one of the worst books I have ever read, but it is certainly very poorly written. As you read chapter after chapter, you are left wondering why exactly you are reading this book in the first place. I can't say I have ever read any other of Zadie Smith's works, but throughout the entire book, I couldn't help but feel like a 13-14 year old decided to write a book. You wanted to like the characters and find something interesting, but the book never delivers. I certainly regret making the purchase instead of borrowing the book from a friend or the library. If you are truly interested in reading this book, don't let me discourage you, but do not BUY the book."
2,Disappointing,"I was hugely disappointed with ""On Beauty"" after being blown away with Smith's debut ""White Teeth"". I was certain that she was the UK's new wunderkind.Many of the storylines lagged with soggy prose and inconsistent characterisation. Who are these people? We get to the end of this book not really knowing the essence of these characters. Too many of the characters are unlikeable. Not helpful for one who is desperately trying to like a book.I was also concerned with the amount of typos. I am a shameless stickler when it comes to this and was horrified to find so many mistakes. Where were the editors?It's not all bad, though. There are some beautifully written and hilarious moments throughout this book. The overall picture for me, however, was that of a boring effort and one which did not deserve to be shortlisted for the 2005 Man Booker Prize."
1,Disappointing,"After having read ""White Teeth"" a few years ago, I was anticipating another novel of similar caliber. What a disappointment!While she acknowledges up front that it is written as an hommage to E.M. Forster- the storyline is needlessly convoluted in order to mirror the plot of ""Howard's End"". What's worse are the underdeveloped, frustratingly shallow and across the board uninteresting characters- at the end of the book the reader doesn't particularly care what happens to any of them. I gather the intent was to examine personal relationships through the lens of larger scale issues of class, race, gender and aesthetic- but to say that she falls short is a gross understatement. It just feels so contrived- the dialogue- the meandering plot- the lifeless characters- all of it. This is definitely not a novel that will transport you into the story. It was a complete waste of time to read (I am kicking myslf for buying it in hardback)-and such a let-down after having read Ms. Smith's other work."
2,Utterly Lacking,"Zadie Smith may have bitten off more than she can chew with ""On Beauty."" An examination of families, academia, race, class, infidelity, truth, and, ostensibly, beauty, the novel is wide ranging yet lacks a cohesive center. Smith relies heavily on dialogue that is unrealistic, clunky, and detracts from both the narrative threads and character development. Her grasps of American English is tenuous at best, especially her portrayal of ""street"" talk and even her use of academic language. Furthermore, her characters' voices lack consistency and constantly contradict themselves in tone and cadence. That said, the plot is fairly engaging, in particular the story line that follows Harold Belsey through a mid-life crisis. Perhaps in the future Smith should stick to a world that she knows and understands, as well as employ an adequate copy editor. For an intelligent and witty look at academic life and marital relationships, I heartily recommend Richard Russo's ""Straight Man."""
1,Disappointing,"I recently got this book and White Teeth and was disappointed in both. Descriptive passages without narrative momentum, snarky and repetitive. This author does not have much to say. I would recommend at least getting them from the library before you waste any money."
3,Doesn't dazzle but has a great dialouge.,"On Beauty takes place in a suburb of Massachusetts and follows two families: The Belseys and The Kipps. Howard Belsey is an Art History professor at the prestigious Wellington University. His archrival Monty Kipps comes to Wellington for a year with his family as a visiting professor. Howard and Monty represent opposite ends of the spectrum: liberal and conservative, non-religious and religious, pro-Affirmative action and anti-Affirmative action and on and on. Their views are brought to life as On Beauty covers the year they share at Wellington.On Beauty has strong character description. It tackles the various issues that professors and students of a university face as well as the issues of the home (loyalty, fidelity, marriage, parenting, etc.) While not a fast paced read this book provides a good deal of conversation starters and controversial topics. It would be a good book group read."
1,On Beauty,"I did recieve this book. I did not order this book. If I did order this book it is because I clicked on the incorrect box. I have not read the book. I will keep it, however. It is just too much hasstle to return the book to you.Arnetta Swan"
2,I suggest David Lodge...,"If you'd like to read funny novels about academia, read David Lodge. As did many reviewers, I enjoyed White Teeth for the author's brash, audacious style (with certain reservations). This review should be rated in yawns not stars- she is an author with prodigiously interesting images but who really struggles when it comes to investing her own heart into characters and plotlines. Too clever for her own good and the reliance on Howard's End is a misstep. Clearly, Zadie Smith is the darling of critics but I trust Amazon reviewers on this one."
2,Didn't do much for me.,"This book, though good, wasn't great. I expect great from something receiving so much hype. I was interested in the story, but didn't much care about what happened for the characters. I wish I had spent my time somewhere else."
2,am I the only person who thinks this author is severely over-rated ?,"White Teeth was dead boring but gave her the benefit of the doubt and perservered with Autograph Man, which again failed to capture my interest on any level. Have only read On Beauty as I always try and read the Booker shortlist and how this novel can be nominated,let alone shortlisted is beyond me. Again it just seems to be a raving mess. I really want to like this author - she interviews well, is very beautiful, I definately admire her, but if this wins over Arthur and George and Never let me Go there is something seriously wrong ( although last years winner was rubbish too!)"
1,Write about what you know,"Zadie Smith knows little about life in a small liberal arts school in Massachusetts. After all, she is not even American and it appears that she has done little research on this subject matter. Characters did not seem realistic or believable. It seemed to me that she or her publisher wanted to market the book to an American audience so she made the book take place in the US, but that subject is not her expertise.I understand that this book was nominated for the Booker - I am starting to lose respect for the prize. It is not even well written. There is much better fiction out there - skip this one!"
2,Better under the original title: Howard's End,"As gifted a writer as Zadie Smith is, she disappoints in ""On Beauty"". Lifting a novel's entire structure from E.M Forster is not an ""homage"" - it is plagiarism. Translating another author's plot into present-day idiom is, at best, a sophomoric exercise. I expected better from this talented author.Do yourself a favor and ignore the hype that surrounds this book. Read the work in its original form, E.M. Forster's ""Howard End"". And pick up Zadie Smith's ""White Teeth"" to see what this author can do when she refrains from the derivative."
2,Couldn't Finish the Book,"I initially enjoyed this book and the characters but as I got further into the story, I started to feel like it wasn't going anywhere. The story seemed to run out of steam for me after Carlene discovered the truth about Howard's affair. I found myself wandering and losing interest after that point and then I finally gave up without finishing the book."
2,So what IS the fuss?,"So I read it -based upon the euphoric reviews. Excuse me - while there are two hilarious scenes regarding academia (Zora's blackmail of the dean to gain admission to a class and a university faculty meeting) and one truly sad scene when an older faculty member goes back to visit his working class dad, there is nothing else to recommend reading 400+ pages about basically uninteresting, sometimes nasty folks - no matter what their color. The book is disjointed in terms of narrative and uninteresting in terms of characters. If I met them at a gathering of any sort I would run for cover and I am so annoyed that I spent as much time with them as I did."
3,Worthwhile But Requires Perserverance,"For its first 200 pages, 'On Beauty' lacks clear momentum. The characters aren't yet in sharp focus and the reader - this reader at least - is uncertain of where the plot is heading. Once the story begins to come together, however, it takes off with a bang, rewarding the patient reader with plot-lines that neatly (but unpredictably) interweave and characters that are fully realized and sympathetic, despite their flaws. Smith's send-up of the vacuousness of modern academia is spot-on, and the pain her characters cause each other and themselves really resonates. The ending of the novel is simultaneously ambiguous and satisfying - as in life, some characters are left happily and others less so.I would recommend 'On Beauty,' but it requires a willingness to plod through the first sections."
3,Mixed Response,"It has taken me over a month to get round to writing this review, as I really struggled to decide whether or not this book is worthy of recommendation. An enjoyable read, certainly, but often it seemed to me that Smith was making a point and I was simply missing it...unclear where the narrative was going, what the characters were about and actually at times what the whole point of the story was. Howard's spinelessness irritated me endlessly. A shame, since Smith's style of writing is accessible and persuasive. Will read 'White Teeth' on the basis of having read this novel though, as I am told it is superior to 'On Beauty'."
2,Hype Only,"After writing ""White Teeth,"" (which I highly recommend) Zadie Smith has not come close to a satisfying read.The plot of ""On Beauty"" is unoriginal -- how many times have we read about middle aged professors sleeping around, with the ""good"" wife and hip kids -- puhleese!The main charcters are uninteresting, and the writing is just OK.When the cover of a book has the author's name in type 5 times larger than the title, watch out!Waste of time."
1,Chekov would've hated this novel,"Chekov would've hated this novel. Why? By the end of the novel, there are a dozen guns on the mantle, not one of them fired.Every character had potential. Every story thread had potential.But non of them go anywhere!I read the whole novel WAITING and nothing ever really happened.There is an affair which has no real meaning in the book but to supposedly add weight. There are friendships which never go anyhwere.The supposed main plot never even really happens.Guns guns everywhere but not a single shot fired!"
2,what an overrated slim book,"Hard to beleive a first time novelist would have gotten this published, let alone well reviewed. the characters don't speak anything like real people (an inner city rapper: ""I'm awfully glad you could come.""), the plot is barely in existence, the last third feel chopped together in a software program. Its childish. Prudish. Pompous. Read any two pages and you'll see."
1,Oh Dear,"Having read White Teeth with glee and interest, I felt that On Beauty might be as good if not better. It is not. It is annoying. What happened to the editorial process? Zadie Smith uses English vernacular where American would be appropriate. It's a trap a lot of English people new to America fall into and it is jarring.The story is just a ghastly rehash of the usual academics-are-god type that has been written countless times, and it is done without gusto. There is a smugness to the tone of the writing that is also unattractive. There is a lack of wisdom to the whole enterprise that makes this read like a high school essay.In summary, I agree with the above reviewer's comment ""the author overlooked the necessity to keep the book interesting and credible."""
2,High expectations crushed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the only book by Zadie Smith that I have read and by the contents of this one I don't feel like reading any other. However, I guess I should not judge this ""it"" author by one lousy book. This book was so boring, it centered too much on academia and not on the people who had potential of being slightly riveting. There were too many stories at once, the connection between the characters was dubious, none of the chapters of the characters culminated in a satisfying ending. To conclude, Howard is such a bore, it was a mistake to center the book on this character."
1,Too many words and not enough substance,"This was the first time while reading a book I have lost my place and thought it wouldn't matter where I started again. I was tempted to go on reading close to the end rather than try and find my place. Now having finished and read the whole thing I regret the extra time spent. Not only did the characters not learn from each other or develop over time, but I stayed much the same too from taking the journey with them."
2,Bland and unbelievable,"I cannot understand the praise this book has received. The subject matter was kind of boring, the characters completely unbelievable. It was an ok read and I laughed once or twice but it was really nothing special."
3,I own this DVD ...,"I love this dvd only because it does have some of Aaliyah's music videos on it. BUT... it is pretty poor quality! You pay full price for this dvd that comes factory sealed.. but I tell you... U couldnt tell the difference between this and a cheap bootleg off the streets!! The music videos are not edited well.. there is some cut off at the begining and the end of the videos and like I said.. the quality is pretty poor. BUT... if you are a huge Aaliyah fan... this is still one that you would want for your collection just for sentimental reasons. But Im warning you... just because this is a dvd factory sealed, that doesn't mean anything... don't expect too much!! You WILL be disappointed."
1,DVD is Not Legal,This DVD listed is not legal. It is made by a company putting MEPG files on a dvd. It was listed on EBay and all auctions with people bidding or who had won were cancelled.
3,Music Videos on DVD: Aaliyah,"Not the greatest quality, but if you want to get a few videos you may have not have been lucky to get of her, I would buy it. I was disappointed because I wanted Summer Bunnies, it is not on there. The box is misleading, and the people who rated this item did not rate it honest. Summer Bunnies is not on this DVD. Very disappointing. I had all of her videos. Thank God, it was only $8."
4,Volere Volare,A clever comedy that mixes animation with real life. Well done another masterpiece from Maurizio Nichetti.
1,Worst movie ever!!,"First of all, I don't wanna diss Ice T nor Snoop Dogg. But I feel that I must warn everybody about this ridiculous movie. Not only the movie is ridiculous but the price too! The fight scenes are very fake (you can see that they don't even touch each other ever). The shooing scenes are even worse. No special effects were used what so ever. Snoop Dogg & Ice T both got better movies out there, so just stay away from this one! PEACE!!!"
1,One of the worst of all time,"Looking at the cover and reading about rhe movie made me think: ""Dang, this can be one funky movie with Snoop Dogg and all"" but watching the movie almost made me puke.First of all the filmmakers are using some really weird filter which makes everything seem all fluffy and weird. And the sound is very weird as well, as well as the camera-work.And there is no introduction in SNOOPS mission, the movie starts in a factory in Russia and ends one hour later in the same factory.And the only words that the ""actors"" are saying are stuff like: ""Dang, I wanna Smoke some W**d"" and ""M****erF**ker, Kill That N***a""...If I would have made the movie It would have been 200 times better"
1,"Whoever made this, kill yourself","this movie is absolutely ridiculous, you have to be kidding me this is pathetic"
1,Hated it!,"This movie was painful to sit through. I just knew that it had to get better, but it never did! Please don't waste your time seeing this one."
1,Incompetent,"Albert Pyun is a strange director. Some of his movies are very enjoyable while others are just incompetent in every way. ""Urban Menace"" falls into the latter category. The story is incoherent, something about a bunch of guys running around killing eachother for some reason we're never really told. Snoop Dogg was apparently some sort of priest of the church that burned down in the beginning of the movie. Anyway, I didn't care about any of the characters and was completely uninterested in the so called ""story"". The picture quality is extremely bad.Watch this movie only if you want to see some of the most incompetent filmmaking available on DVD."
1,not even snoop could save this one,bad movie terrible visual effects low budget filming just horrible i hate i even purchased it
1,Dasheiks 2 Centz: The Worst movie of all time.,"If there is an award for worst movie of all time, this has to be the winner. I can,t even continue..."
1,Snoop Dogg worst movie ever,"This movie was done in one day because ,it look like the actor just made up their own dialogue. Don't waste your money or time people."
1,Urban Manure,They can't be serious. This is the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life.It's pitiful.It stinks.
1,Made Because of Snoop Dog's Indiscretion with an Aardvark,"One insightful reviewer wrote Snoop Dogg was forced into being in this travesty because someone had a picture of him and an aardvark doing what only should be done with one's spouse. That reviewer may well be on point. Either that or Snoop Dogg was seduced with that funny plant sometimes called Mary Jane. Also, what is up with the lighting for this story? The movie appears to have been recorded on film made in 1917. Bright lights obscure faces, and color is as rarely seen as is any semblance of acting. Maybe an out-dated film stock was deliberately purchased to save money. I wish everyone involved in this abysmal attempt at movie making had saved their time and effort. It would have saved me from regurgitating my dinner while being visually assaulted by it."
1,Don't bother!,"This must be the most god awful movie on the PLANET! If I was alowed to give this film ZERO stars I would, but Amazon won't let me!This film is so bad, I can hardly believe this would be sold by anyone anywhere! Don't waste your time or your money! HORRID."
1,WACK.....WACK....WACK,THIS IS THE MOST WACKEST MOVIE I EVER SAW ..IF YOU SEE THIS MOVIE IT`S BECAUSE YOUR INTO WACK MOVIES..THE CAMERA SHOTS WHERE THE WORST.....OHHH I CAN EVEN GO ON...
1,What a terrible film!,"I received Urban Menace as a gift from a friend who knew I was a fan of Snoop Dogg. Well, not even the D-O double G's appearance in the film could make it worth watching. Bad acting, terrible camera work, and a nonexistent plot all contribute to the overall worthlessness of the film. Some parts of the film are funny because they are so poorly done-- example: Big Pun portrays a ""gang boss"", but he's still wearing a Big Pun T-shirt, and he always looks straight at the camera, obviously reading cue cards. If you see a copy of this, may God forbid your buying of it. If you know someone with a copy, you may watch it ONE time just to see the scenes with Big Pun, and the scenes with Snoop Dogg as some kind of otherwordly-avenger."
5,This was the greatest ghetto film i have ever seen in my lyf,This film was dope yo! My bro SN double OP was awesome ice tand big pun were representin!!get this movie!!!
5,Simply Brilliant!,"even though after reading all ur negative reviews towards this movie, i went out and bought it and i was truelly shocked as it was really just awesome!"
4,A helpful tool while learning arabic.,"While learning arabic you find sentences which you have a hard time to fully understand. You find each word in Hans Wehr or al-Mawrid, but the words context is new for you and your grammar books don't help you much in grasping the meaning of the sentence. That's when you pick up this helpful tool which often have alot of examples that makes the grammar more clearer and understandable for you, thus the true meaning of that tricky sentence is now fully translatable, meaningwise and grammatically.Ofcourse, it have some flaws, spelling errors, etc., but it is a very helpful tool, like no other source or reference tool."
1,Don't buy from TheFactoryDepot - will be remanufactured,DO NOT BUY THIS FROM THE FACTORY DEPOT.I can't say anything about this product from other vendors but FactoryDepot sent me a remanufactured generic toner cartridge instead of the Verbatim listed.They have this remanufactured cartridge listed elsewhere for $10 less.If you're going to get a remanufactured generic cartridge go to one of the other vendors like Professor Ink and get it for under $30 shipped.
4,"Sumptuous reproductions, informative text, nice layout.","Interesting background information on one of this country's foremost contemporary artists. A somewhat fatuous portrayal of the artist and his lifestyle, but a terrific and - thankfully - colorful exhibit of the recent works of this talented artist. Definitely worth buying."
5,Inspiring,"I am an artist, and I loved it!Inspiring artist bio, amazing paintings and descriptions.I loved the Story of a Painting, Its true how much effort has to go in a painting before it is a success."
5,this book touched me,"While I have read a great number of his other books and enjoyed most of them thoroughly, this book touched me like no others. I have two grandmothers living in similar retirement communities to that in the story and this gave me some great insight and understanding to their lives in there. It felt like a true story based on their lives and those of their friends. I highly recogmend the book although it is certainly not like his other epics."
2,Kept waiting for it to get better....,"""Recessional"" was alot like the salad bar served nightly at ""The Palms"" - lots of choices with very little quality. I got the distinct impression that the story line of this shallow novel was only a vehicle for Michener's pontifications on subjects as diverse as Aids, Race Relations and Aging. There was very little character development, so it was difficult to care about any one in particular. But the biggest problem I had was the inattention to detail; detail which has made earlier Michener novels so captivating and entertaining. There are few Michener books I haven't read, so it it hard for me to suggest, but perhaps it is time for Mr. Michener to pack up his typewriter and enjoy the company of his peers in a ""Palms"""
4,not your typical Michener saga,"i liked this book very much, but if you are a regular fan of Michener, you may be dissapointed. I would suggest this book to anyone that has the time to read it."
4,God's Waiting Room!,"A very good description of the options faced by those in the twilight of their life. The plot was really secondary to what I considered the main point of the story, which is the lives of the residents, and the activities of the caretakers. In all, it is a depressing story, but I guess that's the point."
2,Disappointed Michener Fan,"I have read and enjoyed nearly all James Michener's books so when I found ""Recesional"" at a flea market I thought I was in for yet another good read. I finished this book only because I felt compelled to say I read it through. The book is way below Michener's usual attention to detail, has a sappy storyline, several blatant inaccuracies and a reference to a ""retard"" I found disturbing for an author of this caliber. Definitely one for the recycle bin."
2,agree with Kirkus,"The Kirkus review says it all. I wonder if Michener did more than preside over this book rather than write it himself. It seems driven by research his staff has unearthed about retirement homes, death and diseases. He then weaves a weak story, with corny dialogue around this information and calls it a novel. It would get little attention if his name wasn't on it."
1,A dud,"This is a book your boring granddaddy might have written. That it was (allegedly) written by the monumentally talented James A. Michener is hard to believe. It was written relatively late in his life, and he was losing it."
3,I don't remember that?,"I got this because GTA4 Episodes radio plays ""Call From The Grave"". So then I read up on this, I remembered Bathory from `83-`85, but hadn't listened to them in decades. So with this saying it was the original line up, I went ahead and got it. Some of these I don't remember at all, or like. Call From The Grave is awesome, and there are a few others. Half the disc is great, the other half is better off forgotten."
3,Sadly poorly fitting.,"The cover was less of a glove fit than expected (based on the presale description). In particular, the positioning of the sidemirror pockets was poor and causes the fabric to be tightly stretched in a line towards the front wheel. Secondly, there was nocord in the shipping box to run under the car between the two eyelets provided (low down middle of the cover)."
3,"Nothing amazing, but a decent film","This was made here in Chicago and is another one of those films which is better and more interesting on the small screen. Thomas Ian Griffith plays a cop who tends to overdo the rough stuff. When a suitcase full of money disappears during a drug bust, he and his partners are the most likely suspects. There are a couple of nice plot twists, but nothing that made me want to jump up and down. James Earl Jones puts in a nice appearance as the owner of a bar."
2,I was not impressed,"Having watched this movie four times and being TIG fan, I still feel that the movie was unconvincing, poorly written, very raw in too many episodes. However, if you like handsome men kicking butt- this film is for you. Thomas Ian Griffith is an attractive wild cop with moral standards. He plays the piano relatively well and is faithful to his girlfriend. What else would a girl want to see in a movie?"
2,"An average film, but nothing special","Thomas Griffin acts as a kind of Van Damme in this film, it's like a low-budget version of Hard target except not nearly as good ( because no Van-Damme or John Woo ). I am a fan of martial arts pictures and like most american karate films this one is poorly choreographed. Ok Griffin has cool moves ... . The only reason that I wanted to watch this was of Lance Henrikson as he is such a great villian ( see Hard target ). Overall an average film with about 5 kickiboxing scenes along the way."
5,"Great action flick, great way to expose corruption!",It's nice cop vs. corrupt cop. Truth always come out in the end who the corrupt cops are. This movie details that well.
4,An Ideal Character for Suzanne Pleshette,"I thought Suzanne Pleshette was just wonderful in this movie. She is a Police Captain and she is assigned to clean up a station with a lot of corrupt cops. She is tough, but fair. Suzanne Pleshette is so pretty and classy, I really enjoyed it. This role just fits her so well. Even though she had to be hard as nails at times, she still had a sense of humor and she really became emotional at times due to the sadness of so much corruption. It is an excellent movie, the only thing I would have liked to have seen more of is her husband. I wish they would have spent a little more time on her relationship with him, but other than that it was great. If you are a fan of Suzanne Pleshette's this is a must have."
2,bike basket,This basket it s hard to put up and it keeps on moving....I tried to use it for my little dog and it could not hold him. My dog is only 6 pounds.It's really made with cheap material.:(
3,Prety Good,"The basket fits perfectly on my bike, my only complaint is the nature of front baskets, which make the front of the bike heavy. Other than that I fully enjoy it. It fits a lot of things, it sturdy and was easy to assemble."
2,Not what i expected from Wald,"I would have given this just one star but I gave it two due to how easy it was to install. But, it got a low rating from me because of the quality of this particular basket. I bought it to replace my Wald Giant delivery basket which was to big for my needs, the quality of that basket was exceptional. This not so much, when i looked at it right out of the box it looked very flimsy especially the clips on the bottom of the basket. Its first test was a 100 mile 2 day trip where we were hit with rain for two days straight, any exposed unpainted metal rusted in a day and i live in the high desert not by the ocean. Then on the second day i put a small nalgene and my set of rain gear in and the clip that holds the support leg to the basket broke and I had to fix it with some bailing wire and tape. Overall im not happy with Wald and at this point I believe I wont be purchasing a basket of this style from them again."
4,it's a basket. it works.,"I started riding my bike more often, so I got this, to be able to cart things around without wearing a backpack.It's quite large, so I can fit things in it just fine. It's sturdy, so I haven't had any problems carrying too much stuff, although I haven't done a serious stress test (most I carried at once: 4 drinks and some food).The only problem I had was assembly. I have a bike with a quick-release front wheel, so I had to mount with the alternate hole in the support bar. However, that meant I needed screws of a different length, so I had to go get them at Ace. Finally, during assembly: don't over-tighten the screw nuts. I snapped a screw by doing that.Other than that assembly hassle, this works great."
3,Bicycle basket,"The basket is good quality, strong and durable. It is smaller than we thought, therefore it does not hold as much. Also, the brackets to connect it to the wheels for more stability were not long enough to attach to the wheels of the beach cruiser we bought it for."
3,TOO SHORT,"The basket is good and sturdy but the support struts were too shor for 2 bikes and I had to ""jurry rig"" extentions."
1,Don't buy from Niagara Cycle,"The product is fine. It did not fit my bicycle. After two emails, two phone calls and emails to Amazon, I have yet to get a return authorization that you must send with the returned item ( or they send it back ). This is not the customer service I would expect from companies that partner with Amazon. Do not buy from this company if you are not quite sure it is exactly what you want."
5,Excellent Basket,This is the 3rd time I've purchased this basket for 3 different bikes. I can tell you it is the best and I would never ever buy another. It is deep and wide enough for my huge book bag and plenty of room for some grocerys.
4,it works great don't overload like the warning label said!,read the warning label: it's a nice basket had no problem putting it on.. may have to had more cross arms to stabilize and so can handle more weight or thicker arms ...put two 1 gallon milk bottles and basket started to sway...
4,Good purchase. It works,There are more expensive baskets that are cheaper made. I had to add some extra hardware to make it fit on the wheel properly. But it went on and seems solid. It's a nice looking and a strong feeling carrier. It'll do the trick!
1,Never purchased,"Don't hate this item but never purchased it, so why did you ask me to rate it. Thank you anyway."
4,Good for a bag of groceries,"Installation was easy. I attached the legs to the fender eyelets. If you don't have fender eyelets, this might not be for you. Holds a large reusable grocery bag pretty well. It's a bit heavier than I expected. Made in USA."
4,Bike Basket,"I had bought this basket for my daughter who had an older bike and it worked great. Unfortunately, my bike had a different type front wheel that made it tricky to get on."
3,Does not fit hybrid bicycles,"Purchased this to mount on my hybrid bicycle but the brackets that attach to the front wheel hub are not the correct angle. I bought a few things from a hardware store to make it fit (an elbow joint, a few washers, larger screws, and nuts to keep it tight).Since my basket installation was modified, it does rattle but I still feel secure with the contents in it. As far as volume, it could fit about 2 gallons of milk (although it would be tight). Hope this helps."
3,Does not work with quick release,"You cannot use this basket if you have quick release front wheel, which I did not know when I ordered it. The spaces between the bars are also pretty big, so not good for small items."
3,same problem as everyone else,Does not work with quick release front wheel. I tied it with a plastic thingy. It s not elegant but it works...
3,somewhat disappointed,"The basket itself was fine, but had to go out and buy screws and bolts.When I have to assemble, I don't want to have to go out and purchase more stuff."
5,WALD 135 BASKET,"Excellent product, very easy to install. Holds two gallon plastic jugs of water with a little room left over for sundries. Low price. I should have had Amazon send two."
4,Decent Basket,"Make sure your handle bars are the correct diameter and that there is a spot on your front tire to mount the legs of the basket otherwise this is not the basket for you ... i hadn't bought a basket before and probably should have considered this stuff beforehand, the basket ended up fitting on one of my bikes."
4,It is a good basket,"For the price, it is quite good. Holds up really well. Way more than 25lbs worth of stuff."
3,Good starter book,"This book is excellent for the price. It contains basic knowledge with a bit of advanced aquarist practices. Most pics are of good quality, with the exception of some fish that are in terrible condition. This was my first African Cichlid book and I would recommend it to newcommers to the hobby."
2,Inferior,Looks and feels inferior to my other Kipling products. The zipper is problematic in that it does not open and close with ease.
4,Tells it like it is about being a mom,"I listened to this in the car with a friend who has a 2-year-old adopted child, on the way from Connecticut to New York. I was alternately laughing hysterically, and wiping tears from my eyes. Anyone who has ever been, or ever had, a mother, should hear this music."
2,Does not support treo 755p UNLESS you use the adapter and purchase a stereo adapter plug,"The literature leads you to believe it works with the treo 755p. NOT UNLESS you use the bluetooth adapter. It seems to connect since both phone and the earphones indicate connected but it does not respond when music is played. To make it work you have to use the blue tooth adapter (which you shouldn't have to do since the phone is bluetooth). In addition, the stereo jack with the adapter does not fit in the small earplug jack outlet in the phone. You have to purchase a jack adapter also. Very disappointing."
2,Don't like it,"I own several Platronics Headsets (DSP400 / DSP500) to talk on Skype and I own a Macbook.I bough this headset to use with Skype, so I don't need to be wired to the computer while talking (since I talk a lot on Skype). I tried them with MacOSX 10.4.x (Tiger) and now with 10.5.x (Leopard) since I read the quality of bluetooth headsets would be better on Leopard.Since I own several plantronics headsets I was expecting a good quality. I have to confess that I hate the quality. The sound quality is bad and lagged. It drives me nuts to talk for a long time with them because of the lag and because I have to repeat myself several times (because the other person doesn't understand properly)."
3,Pulsar 590A Headset,"Innovative design which is what we've come to expect from Plantronics.However, they should have invested more time in ergonomics.These things are just plain uncomfortable to wear for any extended period of time.Consequently, I'm going with a Motorola ear bud headset.Lesson to design engineers here."
4,Nice headphones with small problem,"Nice sound, very comfortable but who ever deisgn that blue light indicator should be shot.No way to turn off light and it's so annoying to ppl around and at the night time."
4,Good item,"Well it is a really nice bluetooth headset. Nice quality sound when I use it for my pc. I just couldn't make it work with my phone for songs without connecting the analog adapter. Which meant I had to carry it with me... so I had to return it. I think my phone is not compatible with stereo bluetooth or something like that. If you are buying this for your phone, please check for compatibility before making the purchase:) Good luck!"
4,Excellent bluetooth headphone,Have it paired with my macbook pro and iphone and works seemlessly between both. Pairing directly to the macbook doesnt appear to work too well. Use the analog adaptor it works really well.
3,Toy misses the mark,"I didn't look carefully at the picture - the extendable boom mic only extends an inch or so - this means it's not directly in front of the mouth and the result is that I had to speak too loudly to be heard. The audio for music worked as advertised, but the maximum volume was too low as sent through my Verizon XV 6800 Pocket PC Phone.I ended up returning the item and getting a Blue Parrot Trucker's Headset which has a true boom mic and audio volume sufficient to be heard in any conditions. It doesn't have the stereo music capability, but I'm very happy with it's functionality as a phone headset"
5,590A is a terrific product. Great sound and support. Works perfectly with my ipod and blackberry phone at the same time.,"I purchased the Pulsar 590A 2 months ago. It is a terrific product. The sound is great. I purchased it to simultaneously connect to my ipod and Blackberry Pearl phone while walking. Again, I could not be more satisfied.In addition, Plantronics support is amazing. I asked them for the cost to just replace the adapter. I thought I broke it. They said it should be almost impossible to break with normal use. I got another Pulsar 590A headset and adapter without cost to me in less than a week.The unit is small and folds into a nice looking case. The light is no big deal. Very nice looking headphones. I do not understand anyone negatively reviewing this product."
1,Poor Quality !!!!,"I purchased my first headset in Dec 05, after one week of use the unit would not charge, but Plantronics was good enough to send me another one seeing how it was still under warranty! Received the replacement unit mid Jan 06, as of yesterday the unit started having the same problem as the first one; i'm no longer able to charge it. I expected a better design/quality product from Plantronics! I'm now waiting on yet another replacement unit!"
3,Mixed feelings,"Highlights:- great sound in headset, except my voice does not come thru well- listeners report great sound from the mike- good rangeLowlights:- could not pair with home bluetooth cordless from Uniden but could with Nokia cell- voice call volume, even when set to minimum is too loud- cannot pair with multiple phones"
2,Good Sound BAD Construction/Design/Material,"GOOD:The unit produces good (maybe even above average) sound for most lay people. Pairing with the analog adapter was easy; and, pairing with laptop, desktop, and cell phone were very straightforward.BAD:The design of the headset unit is rather small. The (muted silvery) parts of the headset that connect the top part to the ear ""cups"" (speakers) are very cheap. The top (black) part is rather stiff.UGLY:If you have a wide or big head, you will need to spread the headset a lot everytime you put it on. When you do that, the muted silvery part will break sooner than later. It will break either around the area where it connects to the top (black) part or the other side where it connects to the ear ""cup"" units.BOTTOM LINE:If you have small head, this is most likely be a very good bluetooth stereo headsets for you. Otherwise, be very careful when putting them on your head and expect them to break."
4,Plantronics Pulsar 590A Bluetooth Headset,"The sound is pretty good. The only complaint is the connector connecting the charger to the headset - it does not connect well all the time. Overall, I think this is a good bluetooth headset available in the market."
1,"Breaks easy, beware!","This headset was used about 4-5 times and the frame broke. The store that sold it will not replace it, so now it is just trash. Do NOT buy this product, it is flimsy and will break where the earpiece attaches to the head set frame."
2,Cool product Poor quality 590A,"My initial impression was the sound quality was good but the workmanship was cheap. The cheapness was confirmed after about a month when the headphones stopped working and stopped taking a charge. Additionally, when speaking with Plantronics support I noticed a small crack on the union between the headband and the right earphone. Now, these headphones were never dropped and handled delicated since day one due to the noticably cheap quality.On the positive side Plantronics support seems first rate, the reason for the second star. Plantronics must be well aware of the problem because they went straight to processing a return. They are shipping me out a new unit in advance of me sending the old pair back. a much appreciated CS touch. hopfully the new batch has these issues fixed"
1,Don't buy this product!!,"I've had my pair for four months now they look great and the sound isn't bad overall. But that's where it ends. My pair died and would not recharge and the hinges developed cracks since it has plastic hinges with steel pins holding them together. My friends pair also has cracks in his hinges and i am talking about 2 to 3 cracks. I sent them in and they told me that I should not keep them on the stand when not in use, Isn't that what the stand is for????"
3,Not Great for Ventrilo,"I bought this product as a replacement for my often broken computer headsets. The battery life is great, good sound, and great microphone. The only thing I wasn't aware of is that you can't use stereo sound and voice at the same time. You can easily switch between the two with your control panel however, so its not a game stopping issue, just not the fabled PC Headset replacement we're all hoping for."
1,Don't even think of using these for VOIP,"I bought these thinking I could use them for both Skype and my cell. Connects and works fine for cell use (although the annoying blue light flash needs to go). But this headset does NOT work for Skype and Plantronics is clear (AFTER you buy the headset, nowhere is this mentioned on the package or product listing) that Skype/VOIP is NOT supported. I'm a pretty techie guy (build my own PCs., water and phase-change cool them) and I tried everything, several BT stacks and 3 different USB and internal dongles. A one-hundred and fifty dollar stereo bluetooth headset will not work for VOIP? The cheapest mono headsets will work, but not this? Absolutely unacceptable for a higher-end headset and the shifty Plantronics people should make this clear on the packaging. I hope Amazon will change the product details to reflect this."
3,Works well with LG CU500,"This headset works really well with the stereo music player on my phone (the LG CU500) but I find myself using it less and less simply because the headset is so clunky, and that stupid gigantic blinking blue light makes me look like a geek. I'm now in the market for a new headset that's more low-key in appearance and more stylish...."
3,Great Seller,"Shipped on-time.New Condition.Great for listening to music or video,terrible for calls.When I receive a call,no one can hear me talk."
4,blue light annoying,"I have bought 3 now in the last year. I need it, because I have a hearing aid, and this is the only way to use a GSM mobile hands free. But it is a little strange to act as a blue light. I needed 3, because the mechanical quality is very poor.I even was once stopped, driving in my car, by a police officer, that said the use of a flasshing blue light while driving was against the law.That is the reason I am now searching for a better one, of a competitor I presume"
2,Audio Lag made them unusable for me.,As previously mentioned there is a lag of approx. .5 sec. I purchased these for use when practicing playing a guitar. Hitting a string and then hearing the sound .5 seconds later made my otherwise poor playing that much worse and made them unusable.I tried to test them as a headset with my HP bluetooth enabled notebook as well but was unable to get them to recognize each other and I finally gave up. I did not have this problem with another bluetooth headset I have.Tech. support at Plantronics was less than helpful. They insisted the lag was normal and typical of all wireless headphones.If all you need them for is to listen to music they may suffice. But consider the audio lag if you want them for any other purpose.
5,I can't believe I like it,"Don't expect a Wes Craven-written, Steven Spielberg-produced cinematography-rich motion picture, and you'll have a blast. It's like a movie made for a college class assignment. Terrible acting, cheesy effects, horrible dialogue, home-made sets, all shot with home video camera splendor ... I LOVE IT!!! Just the no-stress-on-the-brain recreation one occasionally needs. Very original."
4,Nicely made,"A good slasher film. A bit cheesy in parts by over-all a ... good horror movie to add to one's collection. Don't expect to be scared senseless, I don't think that was the idea of the movie. Just settle back and enjoy a lovely romp of slashing - plus a nice twist..."
1,Did we watch the SAME movie?,"This movie is AWFUL, the acting is HORRIBLE, the sets are really AMATEURISH, the gore and blood level is high but so FAKE LOOKING that i really didn't care...and did i mention the acting? Oh, i did..well it's 80% of why i almost couldn't finish off watching this movie.Ok, enough with the insults..there are some good things about this film that i ACTUALLY liked!!-THE STORY...original but couldv'e been better with a bigger budget, different producers, and sorry Canada..but maybe a US film studio filming it.-THE GIRLS...while most were good-looking, they were also very annoying especially the japanese host and the female contestants.-THE FRIEND - Yes, i knew someone in this film (Jerry, he played the character ""RICK"") that was kinda strange seeing that i bought the film without knowing he was in it. Hmmm... maybe he didn't anyone to know!So that's it, you've been warned!!!"
1,Really NOT GOOD!!!!!! A real CRAPPER!!,Let me start by saying I bought this movie according to the reviews. Everybody tried to tell me how great it was. Well it's not! I wish hell I stayed away. Let start with the plot it could have been good but they screwed it up. It about a Japanese reality show where contestants race for their life for big money while being chased by really silly characters. The acting was very weak and the quality of gore was just to fake. Not to mention the film quality was just like some home video style. No matter what people say about this just back away from this one because the hype does not fit the film.
1,Not even worth a Rental,"Ok, so Renting movies isnt very well known anymore but still, I wouldnt rent this movie much less buy it. Thankfully my friend bought it and all I had to do was watch. Well we both are Horror movie officianados or whatever you consider a Horror Nerd and neither of us found anything about this movie likeable. It was horrible. Simply Put. Horrible. Dont ever buy it. Download it for free or something if you HAVE to. But otherwise forget it."
4,Something nice for cheap,"This bracelet was gift for my girlfriend who likes strawberries, she liked it very much (she's pretty blunt), the only thing is that it was a tad big for her skinny wrist, so she wears it as an anklet, but it is a good product for a good price."
5,"this is one of the best kids tapes ever, adults love it too.","it's hard to find cute, but not too cute kids tapes goin to the zoo is that tape along with jessica harpers wonderful life we are singing and loving our time in the car. buy it today!"
5,Hero worship,"I've listened to Tom's music for years, but I've never played one of his abums as many times as this one (Unless it was the companion volume 'I've Got A Yo-Yo) Buy them both, you won't regret it! I look forward to Tom's next visit to Britain (though I usually finish up walking home in the rain after his concerts)Public transport in the UK is not that good!"
4,Fun songs which my kids love!,This is a really fun cd with lots of variety and great stories and silly songs. My kids quickly developed their favorites but we listen to the entire cd over and over. A great addition to our musical collection for road trips or sitting around the house on a quite evening. You will find yourself singing along with the songs and humming the tunes later.... even when the kids are not in the car with you!
5,THE MAGYAR VENUS,"I am Hungarian born and since 1996 have visited one of the ""Venus"" sites in Austria, along the Danube (THE VENUS OF WILLENDORF). Familiar as I am with the subject, Ms. Hamilton has still taught me something new, interesting, and she did it in her usual ""painless"" way. Of course, the murder mystery portion is also interesting...breathtakingly interesting.If you have never travelled to Budapest or if you have or if you want to, this book is for you. if you want an ""edge of your seat"" exciting experience, read the book. I dare you to put it down without finishing it."
2,Twisted Plot,"Even if you only read the cover, the author still deceived you. The Magyars conquered Hungary about 800 AD and the venus goes back a few thousand years.I also noted every one of Hamilton's Hungarians was either shady, greedy, or both. Worst of all, her plot was filled with unlikely coincidences.I grew up in a Hungarian family and so I regret the author didn't take advantage of Hungarian culture. For example, Hungarian is the world's most pretty language but the author hardly mentioned it. The author also could have written more about Hungarian cuisine.Hungarian cold cuts and sausage have a very unusual flavor that is unlike anything else in the world. Outside Hungary very few people know the taste sensation of a good Hurka."
2,Another Italian Cannibal/Zombie movie.,"Here's another Italian cannibal movie and I continue to find there isn't much exciting about this genre. Again, we have mostly controversy over killing animals which I really don't find either disturbing or entertaining at all.I am also a little bored at seeing Kerman in another movie.There really was one scene where they could have taken the movie 'too far' but they held back.I was hoping they would take things too far."
3,Inspired by Amazon review,"I was inspired by Bill Eyeball to buy this one. He writes that he bought this tape and ""(his) reward was watching two women being butchered alive."" I guess that goes with the title. Fun film, in a hokey politically-correct sort of way. I fell asleep a couple of times (there's a plot), but whenever I woke up I was rewarded by something being tortured or killed. It brought back happy memories of my youth working in the hog slaughterhouse."
2,Bottom of the Italian barrel,"This movie gets 2 stars only for it';s gore content. if you are a completest who needs to see every cannibal gore movie, then by all means check this out... just don't expect much. This movies tries to mix a Jim Jones type cult w/ cannibals. The gore is poorly done. The movie is hard to watch. Not the best of it's genre."
3,a cannibal mix-tape of sorts,"this film is obviously for cannibal sub-genre completists. but if you're closely acquainted with the other notable cannibal films you will quickly notice one thing: umberto lenzi unabashedly stole whole chunks from other films to put into eaten alive. how copyright laws in italy work is beyond me! it is entertaining for what it is, and anything with kerman or rassimov in it is going to be at least fun for an hour or two. but i cant deny stealing jungle holocaust's scene of me me lai being cut open, gutted, and then having hot rocks thrown into her chest cavity to cook the meat, cause really every movie should put that scene in at some point. just think of the possibilities!"
3,Eaten Alive In Jones Town !,"Umberto Lenzi's ""EATEN ALIVE"" is a must have for exploitaion cannibal genre fans! While not the best of it's genre & not quite as good as Lenzi's cult classic ""CANNIBAL FEROX"" it is still a very disgustingly fun entry with plenty of morbid education to be learned about the animal food chain along with a JonesTown massacre twist wich is something different for this genre makes this one worthy of at least 3 exploitative stars."
3,Jim Jones spin off.,It was better the first time i saw it. ok for the second time around. Not a kids show.Cult movie.
4,I liked it!,"The two leads were incredibly beautiful actors, who were enjoyable to watch. The storyline held my interest and I thought Richard Gere did a great job. His obsession with the French woman and his shiftlessness were believable. I've never seen the original film."
2,Lifeless,"I've not seen Jean-Luc Godard's original but it has to be better than this overripe film. I'd call it a case of style over substance but there's no discernible style here. Richard Gere's preening narcissistic punk is downright grating. You wonder what Valerie Kaprisky's architecture student sees in this jerk. But, then, Kaprisky's only real talent on display here is shedding her clothes. Which leads to the film's mandatory love scenes. Boring! There's no compelling reason to see this mediocrity."
1,jean-luc godard's vision was killed.,"Jean-luc godard's first major motion picture, BREATHLESS, is still known to this date for being one of the most influential films of all time. It has a serious plot, but very comedic undertones and that's what this director and these actors could not capture. They took everything that was unique and original in Breathless and still would be to this day, and they painted a soap opera picture over it with over-dramatized acting and unnecessary suspense.whoever made this is a moron."
1,No wonder it was on sale,"I bought this DVD at Best Buy for something like $5, based on the notion that Richard Gere is, in reality, a fairly nice guy. There are really only three reasons to watch this film, however: 1) the music, 2) Valerie Kaprisky's boobs, and 3) the last scene in which Gere's character picks up a gun and is going to be ventilated by the LAPD.Gere plays a lowlife who conducts a crime spree from Las Vegas to L.A., including (accidently) killing a California Highway Patrol officer. Naturally, the more crimes he commits, the more the girl covers for him, lies for him, hides him, and participates in the offenses.Unfortunately, films like this just glorify the most negative type of behavior, and make it seem cool and sexy. By projecting that kind of notion, it becomes nothing but recruitment propaganda for the prison system."
5,Enjoyed this book.,Good sampling of Persian dishes. Had fun making some of the recipes with my husband.
2,Disappointed,"Im very disappointed with this publication, not at all what i was expecting. I love Persian food and used to eat at a local restaurant in the Gaslamp District, downtown San Diego. The dishes depicted are nothing like the wonderful meals served at my favorite restaurants, i was hoping to at least make a few dishes that i remember form my time in California. Guess ill have to keep searching for a better publication ?"
5,GREAT,"We went to see this concert at the beautiful Bass Hall in Fort Worth. He let us know they were making a DVD of the performance, so we could hardly wait. It didn't disappoint! If you're a Lindsey Buckingham fan-(or even Fleetwood Mac fan), you will love this!"
1,"Again, not what you are looking for","Like several other discs available, allegedly of the Drifters Greatest Hits, these are not originals.Save your money. Keep looking for the originals. (I found them in ""The Drifters' Golden Hits"")."
1,NOT 3D CARBON FIBER,OPENED THE BOX AND IT WAS NOT CARBON FIBER!!! IT WAS CLEAR!!! AMAZON NEEDS TO CHECK THEIR INVENTORY ON THIS!update*** 19-NOV-2010Amazon's replacement was still the same. it's not 3d carbon fiber. will return for a refund!!!
2,Doesn't ship on time,"This book is not super-comprehensive, but is a good overview with lots of neat details regarding the oils it includes. However, I ordered this for a Christmas present and got the other things I ordered at the same time, but DID NOT recieve this until after Christmas. Very disappointing."
2,Disappointing but for one of the fours stories,"I had read one of the stories already-The Oracle of the Dog- which was fine, but you can find that in an anthology of Chesterton's Father Brown. Of the other three stories only the Dorothy Sayers was a pleasure. Try to find The Elopement of Lord Peter somewhere else and skip this book."
2,"Rambling, Tendentious",The interviewer has an obvious agenda; he is anti-death penalty. He seeks to portray Wuornos as insane. The reality is much more complex than that.
1,Worst movie ever,I swear that this should've kept in mind the age difference in this movie. The rest of the films seemed to run quite well except this one where they had Rocky and Colt look like they were 16 or 17!
4,My kids LOVE the three ninjas movies,Super fun age appropriate boy stuff. My 5 year old laughs out loud every time he watches these movies. They were recommended by a 16 year old friend who had loved them growing up.
5,3 ninjas kick back is super rad,"The second movie in the 3 ninjas saga was cool, especially how they go to Japan and fight ninja dudes there. The new Rocky is a geek, but the story line was cool, plus Alan McRae came back as their father, the FBI agent, Sam Douglas! Sam Douglas is tough! This movie is cool, and the fighting sequences are action-packed."
1,Nothing to write home about...,"Well, this album has two nice songs. They are not hot. They are just nice. ""Where my homes"" and ""I'll take her"" are the songs I am talking about. The rest are either bad or just remixes of the two abovementioned. Not worth buying! They should have just released a single."
2,I loved these at first!!!,My husband and I were a week away from getting married and still could not agree on our wedding band set. We came across these and instantly fell in love with them.. I ordered them right away and got them 2 days later. The color on the bands were perfect and the outside of the ring was smooth and beautiful.. It was exactly what we wanted.. We haev been married for 3 weeks today and we are so unhappy with the quality of these rings. The color is coming off of mine and is almost completely off my husbands and they are scratched.. I thought titanium was the strongest metal and that if wouldn't scratch... The seller is trying to work with us to make us happy.. I guess we'll see.
5,A Mystery To Die For!,"'Object of His Affection' by T.L. Gray is a fast-paced crime mystery loaded with suspense that will have the reader eagerly turning the pages. A police detective is pushed to the edge as he struggles to maintain his integrity in an already tainted investigation, ""A Mystery To Die For!'Rusty Beach Amazon.com: So You'd Like to... Read A Great Mystery!"
5,Gritty suspense sure to please,"You won't be dissapointed with this crime thriller. Immediately, you identify with Detective Ross Burke. He's human. He makes mistakes. And he has the same problems ordinary people have, plus a few they don't. His struggle to stop evil before it strikes again leaves him exhausted, bewildered and determined. Will he cross the line to obtain justice? This is the battle he must fight from within, while struggling to maintain his integrity in an already tainted investigation."
5,A-mazing,"I have never worked with gumpaste before or made flowers by hand like the book instructs. But I found all of the examples and instructions to be spot on. The flowers I made looked near exact to the picture (I tweaked the flower just a tad, adding my own touch.) Everything is carefully explained and the glossary in the back does just what it is should with easy-to-understand definitions of the contents in the book and things some may not know. The pictures are also wonderful and amazing to look at. I love this book."
5,Making sugar roses,"I scanned through the book, and I am looking forwad to making some of the beautif flowers, Thank you for sharing. This is what I needed to complete my project. I foresee myself in the future to order from you again."
2,Wagan.com says inside the 2227 model is PLASTIC,"Yes, Wagan admits the inside of their mdl 2227 12v coffee mug is plastic even though their advertising states Stainless Steel. It is only SS on the outside. Too bad, because I was going to buy one of these."
4,The weight of the cake,"Set in England during WWII, The Ministry of Fear is the story of Arthur Rowe surviving but not truly living in the shadow of what was once his life. He finds himself hunted by shadowy forces of espionage and the memory of having mercifully murdered his sick wife. Somewhat convuluted at times and not Greene's best effort, but still brilliant and heart tugging. Greene's fire always burns brightest when he speaks to the heart and not of cloak and dagger stuff."
4,Not the Third Man - merely the wrong one,"Greene at his most paranoid turns the war novel into something a great deal more sinister. Forget Da's Army and the spirit of the blitz and see ww2 turn into one man's own private nightmare. Like the dream you have where you keep running, but all you enter is one strange room after another, this is a fascinating book, marred only by the occasional lapse in pace and one of Greene's less memorable leading men."
3,A good yarn,"Proceeds in a surreal fashion, predicting Orwell's 1984 in many respects. A good read, particularly if you like Greene's brand of writing."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book is full of errors, some blatant, some subtle, especially about Jesus Christ himself and about Scripture. I'd give it zero stars. While there are a few parts that are ok, there are some outrageous errors in it and it contradicts or misinterprets the teaching of the Church in a number of places. You can get good information elsewhere without these errors that will lead people astray. Read the real Catechism of the Catholic Church if you want to know the faith. And PS, contrary to the claims of this or any other supposedly Catholic book, the Second Vatican Council reaffirmed in its document Dei Verbum (see section 19), what the Church has always maintained: that the gospels are historically accurate, that they really teach what Jesus did and taught. Don't be fooled!"
3,A diamond in a box of rubies,"I bought this CD originally thinking it was a typical knock-off, you know, a ""All Original Recordings"" type of thing where they are all original recordings with all new original musicians. I was surprised that these really were the original recordings. Although the CD doesn't distinguish itself from others of the same type, THIS CD IS WORTH HAVING for DUANE EDDY'S guitar work on B J THOMAS' ""ROCK AND ROLL LULLABY."" It's way better than allthe versions on various BJ Thomas collections. If you enjoy the sound of a semi-hollow body Gibson through a Fender Twin Reverb, buy this."
3,"Not too bad, not too good!","This is a romantic comedy drama (directed by Robert Ellis Miller in 1974) about the relationship between a free-spirited Russian girl (beautiful Goldie Hawn) who is trying to get to the west and a world-weary American foreign correspondent. Hopkins is playing Kostya, a cheery local black marketeer. He's wonderful with that russian accent he took. Despite the quality of the film, Hopkins says in his biography that it was the worst film he ever played and he argues that he didn't even see it! It's up to you now... Make your opinion!"
5,Now I know what I was doing wrong,"My fitness trainer loaned me this book and before I got halfway through it I knew I had to own it. I will be referencing it again and again and recommending it to everyone I know who is seeking a healthier lifestyle. What a refreshing change to all the books that promise you can become healthy with little or no work or planning. Do it the hard way (gain, lose, gain, lose) or learn to do it the right way, using this book as a guide.You'll be delighted to find out you can throw words like ""determination"" and ""willpower"" out the window and replace them with ""commitment"" - and when you are ready to make the commitment to become a healthier person, you'll really find yourself making those changes.This is a very sensible approach to health and fitness, and is not a diet or fitness plan - you'll find no menus or exercises in here. This book is great for mentally preparing for your journey to health and wellness."
5,Tunes to blast all summer long & into the rest of the year,"This band knows how to deliver rock & roll with the kind of drumbeat, tantilizing guitar riffs and solid bass while not over-powering the deep, gritty vocals that will thunder from yourspeakers. There are slower more acoustic moments on this cd butBNS comes back with another onslaught of heavy, old style metalthat they have cultivated from the bands that have influencedthem. No-they are not copying styles but using their own musicand lyrics to pay tribute to the great rockers who have proceeded them. Get your copy and you'll love each track. As alistener you'll even be able to find people in your own life thatthese musician's are speaking about. Once you own the cd you'llneed to see a live show to understand what many of us already know. This is 'Your New Favorite Band!'"
5,Their Best,"Recipe for Disaster is without a doubt the best album they ever released. Its southern tinged hard rock at its finest. Powerful yet melodic, even haunting. Unfortunately they decided to try and be Metallica/Pantera and self destructed with their next release, Tequila. They threw every concept of melody out the window with Teequila and it really stunk bad. This however is one of the best hard rock albums ever released.They apparently have a new album out, Distilled. Let's see if they learned their lesson and went back to their roots of hard melodic rock."
3,Decent Southern Rock At Best,"Review by Tyler Wagnon:Brand New Sin is a band that I have tried really hard time and time again to get into, but just can't. They play southern-influenced hard rock a la Down, Crowbar, Black Label Society and the like, which is alright and demands certain level of respect, but it just doesn't quite get the juices flowing.Some of the riffs can be a little stoner-ish from time to time, but for the most part they keep things up tempo with a nice rock flair. Joe Altier's vocals bring to mind Phil Anselmo mixed with Zakk Wylde. The guitars take on a soulful feel much like Corrosion of Conformity, so add them to the influences as well.There is nothing wrong with this style of music, as there is nothing about it to hate, but at the same time it's hard to latch on to."
4,What is the best diet? Can dieting be bad for you?,"Nowadays, there are a lot of diets that claim to be the be-all and the end-all. This book demystifies many popular diets and explains in simple terms what your body needs for you to be healthy.When I was told I had to lose 30 pounds, I thought of going to a doctor to avoid damaging my health by cutting necessary nutrients out of my intake. Then my own doctor told me the only way to lose weight is to eat less. That and exercise seem to be the key to fitness and weight loss. Anybody with a serious weight problem should see a specialist. And it has often been said that before you begin a diet and /or exercise plan you should see a doctor."
2,BORING BOOK! but SOME good info,"ok this book is like really boring! but if you are willing to go on a diet the hard way this book is for you! it's not exactly what i thought it will be because i usually look for books on dieting that are simple and affective! i'm 11 and my weight is like 95 pounds! i don't wanna be a fat so! i was looking for a boook to help get rid of my fat easily and quickly but i guess this book is not right for me! try a book called Eat more, weigh less : Dr. Dean Ornish's life choice program for losing weight safely while eating abundantly if ya wanna loose weight by eating only!"
4,Exactly what I've been looking for!,"After years of looking for ""the answer"" to the weight loss questions I had, this book is it! It covers healthy eating, exercise, the mind battle all overeaters face... the answer is here, but the answer also lies in you - your choices, your decisions. This book teaches that dieting doesn't have to be a restrictive period of torture!"
4,Dieting for Dummies,"I think this book is an excellent resource. I completely dissagree with the customer from Ann Arbor. As the title indicates, this book is intended to give the general public basic background about healthy eating and weight loss. This sound, research-based information is sorely needed in response to fad diet claims so prominent these days. And, by the way, eggs do not cause heart disease, and neither does dietary cholesterol. It is well known that saturated fat is the culprit. Maybe you should have read the book instead of returned it?"
2,ONLY A SOUVENIR,"This collection was made for World Cup USA 1994. It is less than exciting; perhaps three tunes are really enjoyable. If you want a souvenir the price is right. A better collection of soccer-themed music was done for the next World Cup. I'd suggest ""Music of the World Cup: Allez! Ola! Ole!"" done for WC France 1998."
4,Good bang for the buck,"Now that NJ has gotten ticket happy for people who talk on their cell phones while driving, this bluetooth is a great choice. It's rechargeable, lightweight and easy to use. I don't use it that often (about once a week) so I have no idea how long the battery lasts if used on a daily basis, but since I've had it, I've only had to charge it once. Great chioce if you want an inexpensive, rechargeable bluetooth."
1,is suck,"when i bought it said brand new in box, but when i recive the item is in a plastic bag, doesnt look brand new to me!"
1,MOTOROLA Bluetooth Headset H500,"I purchased this headset Friday 12/2/2005 from the Alltell office. I used it for the first time on Monday 12/12/2005.Pros: Excellent headset speaker. Best I've ever heard.All features work great!!Cons: Extream back ground noise. Very poor sound quality to the person on the other end. If you drive a Tractor-Trailer truck as I do, forget this headset.DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET!!!"
5,Hiaasen does it again...,"My first read by Hiaasen was Double Whammy, and this book was equally impressive. Great use of dialogue, humorous situations, and a brilliant unfolding plot makes up Stormy Weather."
3,Not so Stormy,While I enjoyed this book I was a little disappointed.Familiar ideas are presented however it seems that no real progression of thought has been made since double whammy and naked tongue.The entertainment value is lost with too many Hiassen cliches and too many re-run renamed villans. Superfluous characters are introduced for comical effect who play no real role in terms of plot development.Lacking is the underlying evil and the bigger picture conspiracy.Read one of his earlier books before this one. I think that you will feel more satisfied at the result.
5,Utterly brilliant,"This is one of the best crime thrillers I've ever read -- like all great crime novels, it transcends the genre by being such a wonderful example of it. It's similar to what Elmore Leonard does, but much as I love Leonard, I have even more of an affection for Hiaasen. STORMY WEATHER is an absolute laugh riot from start to finish, the labyrinthe plot makes it un-putdownable, and it's got an intense streak of moral high ground to keep things interesting. This book rules. --Thomas S. Roche is the editor of the NOIROTICA series."
5,Escapism at its best . I think I know most of these people,"Great humor , great characters , great storyline drawing them all together. Everyone knows someone resembling these characters. I am a fan from way back , and cannot wait for the next one."
4,Miami without the models,"Hiaasen's been chronicling Miami for decades, and his amusement by, and occasional disdain for, its habitues is in full bloom in ""Stormy Weather"". After beginning innocuously enough, introducing a weaselly New Yorker and his wife who plan to videotape the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, his cast of characters soon take on the sun-baked and brain-rotted pall that Miami cast over all...residents and tourists alike. Any book that can make you sympathize with a crazy ex-governor who straps himself to suspension bridges, can't be all bad.If your image of Miami is of tanned and beautiful models strolling Ocean Drive, I highly recommend this novel, just so you can find out how loony the ""American Riviera"" really is."
4,Essential reading for any visitors to Florida!,"Carl Hiaasen, an investigative journalist for Florida, has written several funny, satirical crime stories, featuring an ex-governor of Florida and a State Highway Patrol trooper. This story centres around crimes and scams following adevastating hurricane. Hiaasen manages to knit several separate events into afascinating and amusing story.Hiaasen's books are essential reading for anyone who believes there is more toFlorida than theme parks and Miami Vice."
4,"sarcastic, funny, a good read","this is the first hiaasen book that i read and i was impressed. most lines were witty and hiaasen is one natural satirist :) even though there are plenty of characters with intertwined lives, i never got lost and i believe almost all of them were given enough space for the character to evolve. i have acquired more of his books here in Manila and i can't wait to read them."
4,"Pretty good, not perfect","I love this author's sense of humor and I liked the setup of the story, etc. The only thing that kept me from giving this five stars is that it was a little over the top character wise and by that I mean every single character was a little bit ""too much."" Isn't anyone in Florida normal? Still, I plan to read his other books now because I do think he's funny and talented and certainly a good writer."
5,Great read,I loved this book. My first from this author. It was fast paced and I even laughed out loud. I lived through hurricane Andrew which made it all the more interesting for me. I recommend it highly.
5,Another home run,"Having read every Hiaasen book I can find, I felt confident I wouldn't be disappointed.His characters are engaging and quirky. Many of his tales speak on environmental issues in south Florida. Having toured the area myself, the places and names are familiar to me. I enjoy the way some characters appear in multiple stories. It's like hearing from an old friend....."
4,Wacky and Captive,"This is my first Hiaasen novel and won't be my last. The story moves fast and the characters are difficult to keep up with at first. Finally it clicked in for me and I was able to identify the main characters, ancillary characters and settings. Very descriptive scenery and good character development. More of an adventure although impossible in real life (mine, anyway)and I am sure the characters resemble real people living somewhere even as wacky as they were, but not in my unexciting suburban area. The humor comes from imagining the scenes as described and the predicaments each main character gets him/herself into as well as the thinking processes they exhibit. It was eating road kill that clouded the overall ambience..."
4,Stormy Weather strings you along for a wacky wild ride.,"You are forced to watch as normal everyday people are suddenly transformed by the aftermath of a tremendous (although not transcendent) hurricane. The plot is however a little more transparent than one might hope as most of the sequences occur in a very predictable fashion. This book does however make you think, about your life, and what would happen if... There are several scenes which will take you out of your seat, a characteristic more common today on screens than in books, but it happens here. It is an excellent read, and is quite difficult to put down, but most will see how the plots are interwoven quite quickly"
3,my first Hiaasen read...,"His quirky characters remind me of Elmore Leonard (that's a GOOD thing). It gets a bit confusing sometimes, jumping from character to character, but overall, it serves up an enjoyable story."
5,Another Hiaasen winner!,"There are restaurants I go to and order whatever the 'Special' is because I know it will be the best thing available. It is the same for me with Mr. Hiaasen and his books; I have never read one I did not thoroughly enjoy, and this is simply the next fun one."
3,Always a good read,I have read most of Carl Hiassen's books. Some are more entertaining than others. This one was ok. My favourite is still Sick Puppy.
3,Beach Reading 101,"One the seemingly ubiquitous South Florida crimeish writer set, Hiassen isn't too shabby. The idea for this book seems to have been to think up a bunch of characters (some quirky, some not), a bunch of odd situations occurring in the aftermath of a hurricane, and try and weave them all together. My favorite character died early on though, and some others were a tad too implausible for my taste. I would call it a crime book since most of the action seems to revolve around criminals and schemers trying to make money off the aftermath of the hurricane, and those in their way. Not a bad beach read, but not exactly challenging."
1,So where are the funny bits then?,"OK, so it's a readable story and I cracked the occasional wry grin at some of the bizarre scenarios, but where are the belly laughs that the hype promised me? Perhaps it's a cultural thing and Hiaasen's humour doesn't cross the Atlantic very well? The book seemed to be packed full of in-jokes that only Americans will understand and it made me feel like my friends were talking about a party to which I wasn't invited. Sorry, but for satire and a good laugh, give me a Tom Sharpe book any day!"
3,Really a grate Book. It was a joy to read.,"This book has an any thing goes idea to it. I can't see any one not liking this book, It has it all people geting shot, Big storms, I nut who use to be govener of the state of florida and even a monkey. Some parts got a little slow but I had my share of laughs. I would recamend this book to any one."
3,Stormy Weather: not Hiasens best.,I enjoyed Basket Case and Skinny Dip very much. This one lacks the detailed build up the other books had.
4,"vintage Hiaasen: Miami plagued with loonies, post-hurricane","Carl Hiaasen's books fall largely in the domain of ""if you've read one of them, you've read them all"". This is especially true of the characterizations, but thankfully not the wacky story lines. And Hiaasen has a hiliarious way with words, which can sometimes be rather vulgar (yes, some folks might be offended).In Stormy Weather we have greedy out-of-towners and locals trying to make a fast buck after a hurricane wipes out half of Miami. Of course these folks are violent, crude, and more often than not do not get their way due to hilarious mishaps. Hiaasen is well-known for his hatred of crooked politicians, racists, polluters, and big business. And in Stormy Weather all these elements suffer rather badly, to no surprise.Bottom line: while it doesn't hold a candle to his classics (Skin Tight, Strip Tease), Stormy Weather stands firmly among Hiaasen's better works. Recommended."
4,Crazy Characters Abound,"The cast of characters in this book are so odd and out there, I found myself wondering how the heck Carl was going to put them all together. The crazy one-eyed Everglades living former Governor, the skull juggling lost son, a maniac who is little more evil than Manson, a hot trailerpark chick who knows her only asset is her body and a newlywed who thinks about his job more than his new wife? Three-quarters into this book I couldn't figure out how they would all tie in together and how it would resolve. The storyline was wildly engaging and I must admit, I didn't like the ending but overall it was a fun ride. I enjoyed it enough to try another one of his books."
5,Wonderful John Rutter Music,"I have been a fan of John Rutter since I first heard this recording on tape 25 years ago. I upgraded to CD and have several different version of the music. This is a GREAT recording and belongs in your collection. The singing is great, the orchestrations colorful and it is a wonderful listening experience."
5,Dark Shadows,I am in the midst of watching the Dark Shadows series once again. I was 10 the first time. I was surprised how quickly it engaged me in the story line at age 52. I love it all over again!! It is a masterpiece legacy for Dan Curtis.
4,THE DARK SAGA CONTINUES. . .,"I found Collection 3 not to be as good or as full of twists and turns as Collection 2. But in order to follow this unique series, I recommend you get through this collection. As with any series, there are ups and downs in the writing. Each episode lasts approximately 20 minutes (since there's no commercials). You get so wrapped up in the story that before you know it, you have watched a few episodes one after the other - and it leaves you wanting more! I find the interviews of the cast members at the end of each disk very interesting and informative. Hang in there, Dark Shadows only gets better!"
4,DVD technical review,"I finally recieved this DVD and so I will provide a quick technical review of the actual product. The color episodes of Dark Shadows begin on this set (about 5 episodes in). The color is of course not crystal clear as this was early live color video. That being said, it looks better than i expected. The colors do still bleed together a bit, but i do perceive an improvement over the quality of the broadcasts on Sci-fi channel. All the rest of the aspects of this DVD set are consistent with previous releases."
2,"""special edition"" simply means the buyer is gonna get screwed.","2 classmates bought the regular edition, and not the UofP special edition. they had the same book but did not end up spending as much as the rest of us. I paid $110 for a USED copy and was not able to access any of the additional info with the access code because the code is only good once. the previous owner of the book had already registered the access code, so it was worthless for me."
4,Satisfied,"I was very satisfied with this book, I needed this book for a class I was takeing and the school wanted us to buy it from them for over $130.00. This purchased saved me BIG money. This book was also in better condition than the seller stated."
1,AWFUL EXPERIENCE,"This order was the worst thing I could have ever done!!! The book was not as advertised and when I contacted the seller and was told to return the book, I did. I NEVER RECEIVED ANY CREDIT FOR THE RETURN!THIS SELLER IS CERTAINLY NOT UP TO AMAZON STANDARDS.NEVER, NEVER, NEVER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER!!!"
1,CD was broken and seller did not disclose!,"It was disappointing that the CD was broken. The book was not gently used either--the book should have been classified as in acceptable condition--not good and definitely not ""very good""."
3,Sound is lousy...,"I have this on tape and it sounds lousy, it seems when I play this, the songs seem slower, when I play the ""NAKED"" version the songs just fly by...I know these versions are WAY different than the NAKED versions.... must have recorded several versions of each song.... this a great collection of songs, dont get me wrong but its just the production is garbage, maybe I have been spoiled on CDs so long that tapes just sound like crap... NAKED is much better to me.... my opinion...""I`ve got a feeling"" is just awesome... great song...."
3,Not the best,"I wasn't too happy with the song selections on this CD. It's good enough to keep and the more you play, you begin to like it more. The Beatles do not make anything bad."
5,Let It Be - Fully Clothed,It is sad that the new version (Let It Be - Naked) is seeing so much demand. This is the version released when the Beatles were a group. It is the only one that counts.
1,Even 'They' could blow it,"With the type of career they had it's easy to overlook this abomination but still it stains. No one really cares about Mcartney's emotional problems while recording this album. The guys really needed some curly fries, hot dogs and beer and a good listen to this album. Then they would have burnt the masters. I know people might want to flame me but I challenge any one person to tell me this is their favourite Beatles long player? or that this any more than 10% as good as Revolver. Look past your love for the artist and see this long player for what it is."
2,Perhaps If I'd Seen The Movie,But every artist is allowed a misstep or two. I suppose we should all do so well under the circumstances.
2,"I'M TIRED, SO TIRED....","TO MY SURPRISE, NOTHING REALLY STOOD OUT AS I EXPECTED IT TO. THIS ALBUM DIDN'T DO IT FOR ME 35 YEARS AGO EITHER. I WAS HOPING I WAS WRONG; PERHAPS I'M JUST TIRED LIKE 'THEY' WERE THEN..."
2,Get Back To Get Back,"Forget this over produced rubbish. If you really care about what this album SHOULD have sounded like, and what The Beatles had originally planned to release when they recorded the music for this set, look for the bootleg CD 'GET BACK' which is far superior to this. Now Capitol, GET WITH IT."
3,OK,"This is a pretty good album with songs like Two of Us, Get Back and The Long and Winding Road.By the way, everyone is waiting for the stripped-down version to be released in November. I can't wait either, because it's going to reveal what a GREAT CONTRIBUTION Phil Spector made to the original."
3,"Decent, but in comparison to their usual standards...","This album has some good songs, but it also has some uninspired performances from the Beatles. ""Get Back"" is the highlight for me, while ""The Long and Winding Road"" is a low point, both for Phil Spector's string and choral overdubs, and for it being a bit of a mawkish lounge song. Like the ""white album"", the Beatles do seem like one another's sidemen rather than a cohesive band. However, unlike that album, this is not an all-time classic. If you're just starting out buying Beatles, don't start here."
4,let it be-naked-personal rewiew-by 12 year old greg,"i agree with others, i think it is a fantastic album for a band that was about to split up!.....i recently boughtt the new beatles let it be...naked album, and the sound has defianatley improved.i hav been listning to it a lot recently, although it has a couple of the tracks missing.probaby my favourite tracks r one after 909, ive got a feeling,dig a pony,and get back.if you r quite a big beatles fan, then i would advise you to go out and buy this album.i reckon people hav highly underestimated this album way, i mean, let it be ballard is beautiful and fantastic(written about paul mccartneys mother, mary.)although john lennon is probably my favourite beatle.any way back to let it be.overall i fink it is an absouluteley superb album with some really decent songs on it.fankx for reading my review by the way!"
3,A Good Documentary,"Works well as a documentary of the breakdown of The Beatles. The only problem is Phil Spector's involvment with this record. Most of the songs are quite good and show a harder side of The Beatles (rather than pop i.e. the title track). There's a few mediocre moments, but it all evens out. In some cases Spector's arrangments (but not in all places) cover up the mediocre performances (i.e. ""I Me Mine"") but it is a Beatles record. You have to expect some of both from the most overhyped band in the world..."
5,"Still A Classic, It Grows In Stature Through the Years","No group should have as much talent as the Beatles had. It was nearly impossible for them to screw up any project they had their heart in. They came as close as they could to messing up this one, but they didn't succeed. Phil Spector's sweetened versions of ""Let It Be"" and ""The Long And Winding Road"" earned Paul McCartney's ire (John Lennon was the one who had the idea to bring Spector in), but the fact is, this is a classic just like the Beatles' other great work. Billy Preston gained immortality with his piano accompaniment."
4,Let it Be,"The original title for this album was ""Get Back"" because - after years of experimentation, the Beatles were ready to return to their routes. I for one don't recall their routes involving Phil Spector. Still, the album contains many great songs, which I have enjoyed listening to again and again. ""Two of Us"" is one of my favorite Beatles songs, as is ""Let it Be."" Other goodies include ""The Long and Winding Road,"" ""For You Blue,"" ""Get Back"" and ""One After 909."" Then we have the complete duds ""Dig It"" and ""Maggie Mae"" which should never have come out. But on the whole this is a very good, enjoyable album."
4,Still Very Good,"How can any record that contains the songs ""Let It Be,"" ""The Long and Winding Road,"" ""Get Back,"" ""Two of Us,"" ""For You Blue,"" ""Dig a Pony,"" ""I, Me, Mine,"" and ""I've Got A Feeling,"" rate any less than four stars? By gosh, this is a great album. It's not up to the Beatles masterpiece standards, but it's still very good, much better than most of their conteporaries.To those who think that Ringo couldn't play drums, listen to this record. Most of it was recorded live. Ringo had, and still has, great chops."
4,"Up there But not ""Up There""","Let It Be was one of the Greatest beatle albums, but in comparison to other post-1967 albums, it's a little rough. Don't get me wrong, this album has its momemts. Across the Universe is an altime great, along with let it Be and The Long and Winding Road. Two of Us is pretty good overall but not that great for the Beatles. I Me Mine is catchy, but needed more. The same for Dig it. 9 out of 12 are good, and u (yes, you) must get one copy 2 day. Better than Abbey Road."
5,Hey music guy from Seattle!,"This album may be no Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road, but lay off. What are you some kinda Beatle hating degenerate? Has the moisture up there in Washington gone to your head? You can't possibly have the guts to mock some of the best musical abilities ever to come together in one band. Lay off, and when you get in your ""White Castle burger eating mood"" you can be sure to pop in the Magical Mystery Tour and know that you disgust the rest of the world that appreciates good music."
3,Less Than Fab,"O.K., this album has some great hits (Get Back, Let It Be, Long & Winding Road), but in the final analysis is a very average album. Get the blue album instead (1967-1970); filler like Maggie Mae and Dig It merely tarnish the memory of this once dominant group. Even the album cover says it all; no longer a fab group, but merely four individuals charting different courses. Not helped by the dated ""wall of sound"" production of Phil Spector. And what have they done to Across The Universe; a much superior version can be found on Anthology 2."
4,Let It Be,"Released in 1970, a great farewell album for the Beatles. This is as close as they came to re-capturing the magic behind the early years. Recommended!"
5,Beatles - 'Let It Be' (Capitol),"Review number 340.Yet,another classic rock album I haven't heard in eons.This was,obviously the Fab Four's final 'actual' lp,put out in 1970.Remember fans all over being HEAVILY depressed after hearing about the Beatle's break-up.As far as I'm conderned,'Let It Be' was the perfect swan song for these superstar Brit rockers.Remember most of the tracks here,especially ""Dig A Pony"",the title cut ""Let It Be"",""I've Got A Feeling"",the impressive ""The Long And Winding Road"" and my personal favorite of this CD reissue ""Get Back"".Also really like the way Sir Paul McCartney performs this gem while out on his solo tours.Highly recommended."
5,Underrated,"OK, so Paul McCartney was angry at Phil Spector for allegedly ruining this album -- but don't believe it. He had a point about using his music without his permission, but he didn't have a point about the final product. This album is beautiful, provactive and fun: all in all, what one expects of the Beatles.But then, it isn't a typical Beatles album. It was made under the worst of conditions by a band which had become less a partnership and more a reluctant collaboration between four very different artists. But, unlike the White Album, this disc still manages to be consistent and balanced. Each member's contribution compliments the next, and Spector's production (albeit overdone on ""Long and Winding Road) ties it all together. Don't let McCartney give this album a bad name."
3,Back to basics,"Although a fine album, you can definitely hear the fat lady singing. OK, not literally of course, but ""Let It Be"" surely marks the end of a phenomenal era of rock music. The boys here were making an attempt to return to their roots, possibly to save what seemed to be the inevitable end of the band. For an even more complete account of what was happening, I recommend that in-studio documentary movie ""Let It Be"". This, of course, offers the historic rooftop concert."
4,"Get Back,Jojo!","This is the best song I've ever heard by the Beatles! My Mom and I sing it all the time! It's silly and has deep meaning at the same time, if you know how to find it. I'm a loner like Jojo, and I often wish I knew how to get back where I belong. Sweet Lorretta needs help! ""Let It Be"" and ""Across the Universe"" are cool too. Unfortunately, I haven't heard the whole album."
3,Now You Know Why The Beatles Didn't Last Into The 1980s,"After having heard ""Let It Be"", The Beatles' swan song, I can now understand why this group wasn't around to make any more records past 1970. Most of the record sounded contrived, with the exception of the three hit singles (""The Long and Winding Road""; ""Get Back"" and the title track); and all are forgettable. The Fab Four seemed to be phoning it in after ""Abbey Road"", and it shows. The rock band KISS should, likewise, should have called it quits after they released ""Dynasty"" in 1979. At least The Beatles haven't tortured Americans with 40+ years of continuous new material since their breakup..."
1,Phil Spector totally ruined this album!!!!,"this is the worst beatles album. All songs are good, but Phil Spector did NOT need to put so much orchestratian in the album. I still like the beatles, but no (...) this is the worst beatle album. I DON,T HATE THEM, i jsut think that Spector should not have left this album the way it was and leave the orchestra alone."
1,Why?,"Why the hell did this album show up in my recommended search results??? I don't even like this album! Those four french morons should have ""let their careers be"" and not have even bothered with this freak side-show nonsense!"
1,Their worst,"The Beatles were pretty much over by the preceding album (White Album) which consisted mostly of solo performances with some perfunctory overdubs. This album was their attempt to recapture their ""roots"" but they could not rekindle the innocence of bygone years. Only Billy Preston's keyboard work redeems this otherwise slapped-together effort. Put it this way: if this album had been a demo by some unknowns, no record company would have touched it."
1,Unfinished Business,"""Let It Be"" is an amalgamation of choppy, incoherent pieces that just don't add up. The material on this album sounds like it came from the editing room floor at Abbey Road studios and that's where it should've stayed!On the brighter side, the singles versions of ""The Long and Winding Road,"" ""Let It Be"" and ""Get Back"" are far better than those on the album. As an aside, to this day, I'll never understand why they let the album version of ""Get Back"" end with Ringo saying ""On behalf of the group, I hope we all passed the audition."" Sorry, I'm missing something here. Anyway, Beatles fans would do well to skip this album and get their 1967-1970 complilation album that included these and other great songs of that era.Given the overall weakness of ""Let It Be,"" I think the Beatles should've called it ""Let It Alone."" Fans, take note."
3,Nice buy,"I bought this because I want to save on shipping fees. But I still expect it will be good. It's good, but there's no lyrics coming with it, which it's a little bit disappointing."
4,Don't Let Me Down?,"I'm looking for the song, ""Don't Let Me Down"" by this band called the Beatles. iTunes has never heard of them. And Amazon keeps directing me to the Let It Be album, even though the song in question is not on that album. I am becoming annoyed. Where can I find this song? And why is it not considered one of their classics? Help! Anybody."
3,Overrated,"There aren't significant differences between this recording and the original. True, you can hear the bass line a little better here, Lennon's harmony there, but unless you're a Beatles junkie it's not worth the price. The ""re-master"" is just the producer's opinion of how the songs could be better. The originals are great enough, this isn't an improvement."
4,let it be,"great classic rock. the beatles last album, which i have on album and wanted the cd for my collection. brings back alot of memories"
4,Really good,"I know this album isn't the greatest ever created, but it has some definite gems. John and Paul's harmonization on Two of Us is awesome. Across The Universe is, in my opinion, one of John's best. Let It Be sounds better in the single version, but it stands out as well. The Long and winding road is a great song, but Spector kind of ruined it. John's bizzare rocker Dig A Pony is good as well. As a nice ending, Get Back is a McCartney classic. Overall, this album is very good, but underrated. Considering the group was about to split up, this CD is a must-buy."
3,Can't Stand Spector,"Sorry, Philfans. And yes, I know he was asked by the Beatles themselves to ""fix"" this album. But, after hearing the 3rd Anthology and seeing the video I was reminded of the original ""Let It Be"" film which was available on laserdisc in the 1980's and I remembered the untouched ""Let It Be"" and ""The Long and Winding Road"" and ""Across The Universe"" and it made me rethink this album all together.I don't see it as raw and live, like I used to. The rooftop tracks are great but where's ""Don't Let Me Down""? (""On Past Masters 2"" sez everyone.)One side should have been studio tracks, the other the rooftop stuff. But that's all been discussed, yes?All in all ""Two Of Us"" is wonderful as is all the live stuff. The Spector stuff I could do without. Maybe someday they'll remaster and both the album, without the Spector touches, and the film (which was pretty sloppy too. You see unseen footage in the Anthology boxed video.)"
4,Good not Great,"The songs ""Let it Be"", ""Get Back"", ""Across the Universe"", and ""I've Got a Feeling"" make this album a four. Could easily be considered the best album by lesser groups but being that they are THE BEATLES you kind of expect more."
5,top smoke ?? :),"Huh!!! What was that Ringo???Excellent remastered cd of the Beatles, giving us quality listening pleasure.Raw cd with lots of power...support your favorite artists."
3,its decent,"now i love the beatles as much as the next guy, but i feel that the majority or their albums have maybe two to three songs worth having the album for, let it be was the same way. id say the three on this one would be ""ACROSS THE UNIVERSE"", of course ""LET IT BE"", and ""GET BACK"". songs like ""DIG IT"" and ""MAGGIE MAE"" are just on this to fill the album with the exception of the song ""LET IT BE"", this album is nothing to boast about...."
5,Maybe Not The Greatest Album But A Great Song,"This is definitely not the Beatles best album but there is one reason that I still give it five stars. It has one of the greatest songs of all time on it. The title track ""Let It Be"" is simply magnificent and that alone is enough that this album deserves to be in any collection. The soulful and wanting sounds of this song truly move my soul more than any other song I can think of. Given all that the rest of the songs are still fairly good and though they may not be as good as many other Beatles albums this album is still worth it, in that it is still better than most other music you will find out there."
3,Whats with the Apple on the CD?,I'm 19 and even I know that the Apple on the cd should be RED instead of the usual green! Unless only the American version had a red album but I don't think that is the case.Tisk Tisk.
3,Sad Breakup but Not Enough Proof,"Wow.....good CD, what's with the 4 less than one minute songs though. that was the only thing i didn't like. other than that this album is really cool. you should buy it if you love the beatles2 best songs- let it be & the long and winding road2 worst songs-one after 909 & dig it"
4,Don't Buy -- Will Be Reissued In November!,"The saga of this album has been well documented. This was recorded in early 1969 prior to Abbey Road, which was released later in the year. By the time Let It Be was released in the Spring of 1970, the Beatles no longer existed as a functioning group, and the session tapes were given to Phil Spector. Paul always complained about Spector's overproduction. If John or George had issues, they did not go public with them, and as solo artists they would both work with Spector. Well, with John and George are no longer with us (and Spector has his own issues) we now hear that Let It Be will be re-released without the Spector influence. Could Paul be finally having the last laugh 30+ years later? The re-issue will not contain ""Dig It"" and ""Maggie Mae"" but will instead have ""Don't Let Me Down"" which was recorded during the same sessions. Release date is November 17."
4,LIB: Good But Lacking in Quality,"Speaking as a Beatles fan, I like the album Let It Be, but it seems to lack the quality of the preceding albums.It's very easy to tell that the Beatles were struggling with their disagreements. One of the most tell-tale signs is John's asinine introduction to ""Two Of Us"", where he basically calls Linda a horse.But the album has some good music on it nonetheless. Although John considered the White Album to be a Beatles album with solo works on it, Let it Be and Abbey Road are also. George proved through his songs on Let it Be and Abbey Road that he had as much musical muscle as John and Paul, John was almost totally preoccupied by ""Yukko"", and had little remaining interest in the band, Paul was struggling to keep the Beatles together and Ringo was in the middle of the entire battle.All in all, Let it Be may not have the quality of Sgt. Pepper, but it's a Beatles album, and if it's Beatles, it's quality."
5,Another Beatles' masterpiece,"This new remastered ""Let It Be"" album is almost like having it released for the first time. Any Beatles fan must have this.Non-Beatles music people need to listen to this."
5,Great fun,"This is a great album - however not as great as some of the other Beatles albums - it does feel a bit short, but its still a lot better than most. Some brilliant, timeless songs are here to be cherished forever. So just let it be."
4,The End,"The last Beatles album. So sad to see them go. Any Beatles fan knows , though,that this was primarily Paul's and George Martin's production. For that reason, I never bought it. I only bought it now after so many years to have John's Across the Universe. Anyway, if you are a die-hard fan you'll need to get it."
3,"Let it be. No, really, let it be","I think it is telling that the artwork doesn't show the four of them together. Definitely a shallow album and had it been released by anyone else it would have sunk without a trace. Buy it for completeness, as part of the Beatles story but don't expect anything great musically or lyrically. You can't deny the catchiness of the title track but my goodness is it banal. This is the sound of a band breaking up, of a band that has lost the essential spirit that binds musicians together to create more than the some of the parts. At this time all of them were producing better solo work (however esoteric or commercially unsuccessful)."
2,It's just not very good...,"This album has two giant faults which are cheesy production and a lack of great songs. There are a few bright and charming moments, but those are heavily outweighed by uninspired numbers like ""For You Blue"" and production massacres of ""The Long and Winding Road"" and ""Across the Universe."" No number of excuses or explanations can write away these fundamental problems with Let it Be. It's just not very good."
5,Phil Spector cleans up this mess,"From what I read,""Let it Be"" was a mess.Phil Spector was given hours of tapes,and was told to make an Album of this junk.He was in his glory.Phil Spector had little respect for other Artist.He always took over,and made the records into what he wanted them to sound like.Years later,when he worked with Lennon,John had to lay down the law,and they became a great team.The Beatles were already broke up when this album came out,and were shocked to hear the over production,especially on ""The Long and Winding Road.""I think this is a great album,even though you can tell the Beatles were not into there music anymore.Even the film,with everyone fighting,and Paul telling George and Ringo how to play Guitar and Drums.If you are a Beatles fan,you have to get this CD,even though Phil Spector makes this record so different from all the other Beatle albums that George Martin produced."
4,Very Depressing To Hear The End Of The Beatles.,"The albums Abbey Road and Let It Be marked the end of the greatest Rock and Roll band of all time. Abbey Road was a brilliant album. Let It Be falls short of brilliance, but remains an essential album for any Beatles fan. This is one of the few Beatles albums to contain not so great songs. These songs are Dig A Pony, I Me Mine, and Dig It. The rest of the songs on the album, however, are up to par with the rest of The Beatles's songs. This album contains such classics as Across The Universe, Let It Be, The Long And Winding Road and Get Back. It also contains more little known gems, such as I've Got A Feeling, One After 909 and For You Blue, which is one of Harrison's best songs. This album is essential listening to all Beatles fans."
4,This Album has good songs and bad songs,"Though most of the CD is filled with the good songs.""Two Of Us."" But on the bad side I'd say ""Dig It"" would be about the worst with ""I dig a Pony"" second behing DIG IT. Dig it seems a 50 second mesh of words creating nothing but a meaningless song. But overall it's a good album and I recommend that you buy it!"
1,No MUSIC,"With a track listing on Amazon, I assumed we were ordering a music CD, what we received was a Video CD in quick time format."
1,Unfortunate Encore,"It is truly a shame that this was ever released. They should have just bowed out with Abbey Road.With the possible exception of ""Get Back"", this is pretty forgettable. John's awful singing on ""Across the Universe"" is painful.Skip It."
2,exceptionally bad,"There is not much more to say, this is acceptionally bad for the ears and spells narcism and l'arrogance. I donot like this hiphop music"
2,"THE SAD :( ""LET IT BE""","What goes up must come down.... It happened to Elvis, Michael Jackson, and the list goes on and on!even the Beatles in 1969 came tumbling down! This CD proves it.. worn out mad Beatles. Please give credit to Paul and Ringo however for putting out ""Let It Be"" Naked ...which did save this period for The Beatles."
1,Let It Be,"I never recieved this DVD.......I emailed the seller and all he wanted was my zip code,which I sent to him....I have emailed him three times but never recieved my purchuse. I am on a fixed income and wanted it to give as a gift..I am very disappointed.....Lois Eddy"
4,A Good one,My seventh favirote album from the Fab four is Let it Be. Let it Be is my favirote song of all the Beatle songs Long and winding road is great and so is one after 909 one of there older numbers which finally got recorded. This was the album where Yoko just was there to much and it showed because they broke up after finishing this album in January 1970. GodBless
2,Pax on Phil Spector,"I still have trouble listening to this album after all these years. Spector ruined what was really an OK effort, not great. I sense the HAND of Alan Klein at work, yet again. This may have been a final cash in, but the listener is left wondering 'what the hell happend here?' The only two songs that ever capture me are the George Harrison penned tunes. TO me, this album is personified by I,Me,Mine."
3,Beatles Let it Be,I did not like it as much as the early Beatles songs.Still enjoyable with good melodies and acceptablewords to songs with a lot of meaning.Their early sixties Beatles a lot more funTony Scrivanos
5,"Great, and not even one of their best","Let it Be is usually placed behind Sgt Pepper, Abbey Road, White Album, Revolver, and maybe one or two other Beatle albums. The fact that this album is considered no better than the Beatles' fifth best work, and yet includes classics (or at least semi-classics) such as Across the Universe, Two of Us, Let it Be, Long and Winding Road, and Get Back, says ALOT about the band. I started listening to it again for the first time in 30 years and became smitten with it again."
5,What else can be said....?,"Okay, let's face it this is The Beatles last studio recording and it still holds up today!The truth about this group is that for those who actually saw them or even heard them during their short but triumphant time in the music biz there has never been a group that can hold a candle to them, they changed the music industry and the sound of modern day music for the best!While music that is being produced today (some) is very inventive it is still eons behind The Beatles contributions.There are many songs that we still hear today that many of us still know all of the words to and usually sing them with great fortitude.There are very few ""Beatles"" releases that are not worth the price being asked and this is not one of them...."
4,Turned out pretty well in the end!,"This album is a curious mix of old and new ideas, old and new recordings, old and new productions. As such it's a bit of a mish mosh, and yet it bosts the usual four absolute classic Beatles hits, and some jolly fine performances, particularly those done on the roof of Apple. Phil Spector cobbled together some different takes here and there, so it's not all audio verite, but what the heck, we're grateful for what we can get."
3,Let It Be,"I bought this CD for one reason-the version of ""Let It Be"" that only seems to appear on this album. Specifially, the guitar solo is what I paid for. It is one of my favorites of George's. The tone is beautiful and the phrasing is very elegant while still having a few juicy dissonances. The solo on all of the ""greatest hits"" packages and many radio broadcasts has some horrible chorus type tone rather than this crunchy distortion.""Two of Us"" is a great tune that is really incredible since John and Paul were at each other's throats so much yet still turned out something this beautiful.Lots of duds on this one though."
4,It's the Beatles!...Shut up!,"Their contract was up.They didn't re-sign. End of story. But what a legacy! No matter HOW you MIX it!My title is what McCartney said when asked about the White Album being too long and should have been cut down to a single, better record.The Beatles songs are cemented into my own personal being just like all the things that happened to me along the way that make me who I am today.And I'm talking about the first time I heard the song. Where I was, my age at the time, the whole life experience. It's as deep as my mother reading to me as a child.It's the Beatles! Shut up!"
3,Agree,"Although I don't like the album quite as much, The Long and Winding Road and Get Back are good songs that wouldn't have existed without Phil Spector stepping in.The Beatles basically dumped a bunch of unfinished demo tapes on Spector, who turned it into a respectable release."
4,Vibin'!,"Now, who do you know that didn't have this in their private stash of LPs? They didn't mind other albums gettin' mishandled by clubhanded party guests and Malt-o-Meal eating babies, but this one was always in the ""don't nobody but me touch it"" file....and for good reason, too. Like me, them audiophiles couldn't live normal life if anything disrupted that funky groovin' and mellow vibin' Ayers and crew presented on this mystic thang. The newest Ayers I purchased was ""Naste"" a few years ago....it was, kool, but can you imagine hip-hop in your vibe? That, to say the least, wuddn't fer me. That's why I love this ol' skool Ayers. You can put it on and you feel that...Uhmmm-huuuh."
3,good little compass keychain,"This is more of a novelty item than a serious compass, but it generally works just fine and is a seriously good value. Very handy for orienting yourself on unfamiliar streets."
4,"Micro, but effective","Solid small compass, packed away nicely of course. Helped me navigate the wilderness this past weekend."
5,Excellent! Worth the money!,"This CD is great for children and adults alike! The music is relaxing, fun and catchy. My daughter loves it! We picked it up at our local library. I plan on purchasing it for her for Christmas!"
4,Class of 1999,"i know it's guilty pleasure, but i loved this movie. if you find anything on bradley gregg e-mail me! the last time i saw him was on the jenny jones show, but accident...she said he was a member of her staff. anyway, this movie is about teens outwitting adults, esp. teachers, and takes place in my hometown of detroit, mi. rah for the teens!"
3,Not Bad...Not Bad...,"Viewed: 9/11Rate: 69/11: Not too bad at all, Class of 1999 is pretty much Weak Terminators meet The Warriors in a school setting with a bit of Escape from New York thrown in. Class of 1999 is not a masterpiece, to be sure, but I think, for a somewhat low budget film, it is very creative as it can be. Of course, everybody knew what kind of a risk they were taking when they knew it was going to be a cheap-o fare of entertainment. That's why it helped more to have some veterans on board such as John P. Ryan, Pam Grier, Malcolm McDowell, and Stacy Keach. The last one had the coolest eyes and hair I've seen. I just wish that Oscar ""Manny"" Manheim would show up at school and take on Mr. Hardin once again. All in all, I liked how Class of 1999 turned out, and I wasn't bored at all."
3,"Oh my, people","I dunno what movie you saw, but this movie is terrible. The only good thing about it is it's comedic value. That, and I watched it with a total hottie."
2,This movie...,"I don't know which movie you people saw, but in my opinion, this movie was terrible. The only good thing about it is it's comedic value. That, and I watched it with a total hottie."
1,Worst pants Ever,It was 8 years ago and the pants were apparently at its worse. Stacey Keach's hair should be jettisoned into space. If you like bad movies or wear horrible pants this is the film for you.
5,The easiest clean up...,"I was so surprised how easy it is to clean up weeds. Sure it is better to pull the weed at the root; however, with a bad back and limited time....I don't have 3 hours to spare. This and the full size makes clean up a snap--what took 3 hours of pulling was reduced to 15 minutes and NO BACK PAIN! Now I enjoy the quick clean up because I know it will be quick and painless. Hey....you don't get extra points for pain and suffering--get this and the larger version for standing position too!"
3,rake really small,"Since I thought I was ordering a longer hanlde one which this one isnt I now have to bend over some---works ok, kinda cheesy, but would prefer a long handle one. My error"
1,wrong item delivered,"i probably would have liked it, however i was sent the wrong item. i looked forward to using this thing too!"
4,And a punk legend returns!,"This IS a good CD! It sounds little like ""WAy of Life"" and even less like the masterpiece ""1989"". The ""new"" Resort- Roi with ex Anti Nowhere League guys (and not much of a ""We Are the League"" sound either!)- is rawer & faster but, at the same time, CLEANER than any of their previous releases. Five new songs which recall a cruder Sham 69 c.1978 (for want of a better discription), re recordings of ""violence in our minds"", ""held hostage"" and ""rebels with a cause""- three only song to appear on all three albums this is THE best version and the best track on ""Resurection"". But wait, there's MORE: three 4 Skins classics, plus good covers of Warzone and Agnostic Front! Too bad there were no Anti Nowhere Leage covers- I'd LUV to hear Roi crooning to ""let's breat the law"", ""woman"" and especially ""so what"" (Id also have liked this line uo to have done ""king of the jungle"" again.)"
3,Author! Author!,Well worth the price for the Director's Commentary alone (by writer / director Phil Leirness).Hilarious! --Features loads of Hollywood insider dirt!
4,Great Music Great Cast,"Creative Genius Phil Leirness gives us an entertaining film shot in 1997 but not released on DVD until 2002. The cast are all spot-on and John Saxon gives his usual solid performance. Sid Hillman's songs are an added bonus as is Director Phil Leirness' entertaining commentary, listen carefully and you may hear Sean Connery..."
2,Nothing is ALL bad.......,"DREAMCATCHER, as a title, suggests there may be story reasons for spending time watching this movie. Stephen King does know how to spin a tale (as we are reminded in seeing at least one of his books make it to the screen every year). The problem is there just is no story here. A scary movie? No, a very funny spoof of the alien genre duds perhaps. BUT, there are four really good reasons to sit through this otherwise forgetable bit of indigestion: Damien Lewis, Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, and Timothy Olyphant. They make the best of a scrawny script and play off each other very well. As for Donnie Wahlberg, Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore - well, maybe it was easy money. A movie to see only if the desperation level is higher than the judicious taste level."
4,"Good mix of horror, sci-fi and action!","The story is original, the characters well played and the film script which had indeed the potential to be a disaster...is NOT!"
1,Dreamcatcher,STEVEN KINGS MOVIE.......DreamcatcherHAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST DUMB-ASS MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEENI WON'T TELL YOU ANYMORE THEN THATBUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE..AND FIND OUT THE HARD WAY...LIKE I DID.
1,Just plain awful,"This supposed ""horror"" movie has a lame plot that never develops despite expecting you to sit through it's awful 124 minute run time. ""Dreamcatcher,"" like most Stephen King movies, should have aired on TV and spared the poor saps who spent money on his latest piece of trash."
1,GOD AWFUL,"THIIS IS ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT WAS PURE TORTURE SITTING AND WATCHING IT. I KEPT THINKING TO MYSELF THIS HAS TO GET BETTER IT CANT GET ANY WORSE. IT PROCEDED TO GET EVEN WORSE AND WORSE BY EVERY MOMENT, WATCHING THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY, SANITY, AND MONEY. IF YOU LIKE STEPHEN AND I DO, PLEASE DO YOURSELF THE FAVOR AND DONT TORTURE YOURSELF WITH THIS POORLY ACTED, POORLY SCRIPTED, POORLY STUPID LOOKIN ALIENS..BY FAR ONE OF THE WORST THINGS I HAVE EVER SAT THROUGH IN MY LIFE. I GAVE THIS MOVIE 1 STAR SIMPLY BECAUSE ZERO WAS NOT AN OPTION.THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This movie is absolutely terrible! I had to ask myself if this is the downfall of Morgan Freeman. I don't know why a respected actor, such as Morgan Freeman, would take on such a script. This want to be ""aliens"" movie leaves much distaste with it's gorry scences and lack of script. Save your time and money!This movie starts out with a lot of potential. After the first alien comes out of the persons butt, with LOTS of blood, I was ready to turn my head and read a book, which I should've done. Graphic scene after graphic scene is what this movie is about. Unless you are into blood and evil creatures, do not buy this movie!!!!"
3,Bad adaption of a so-so Stephen King book,"Hey I love Stephen King as much as the next guy, but DreamCatcher will certainly never be praised as one of his all time greatest works. It was barely OK. The movie starts off pretty good and true to the film. But after a half hour or so it takes on a story of it's own. The last 20 minutes is so rushed you'll feel like you missed something. You did, read the book.Morgan Freeman (how does he end up in all these movies?) does a good job, but even he is getting to be boring by playing the same character over and over again."
3,What Happened?,"I'd been waiting for this movie ever since they kicked me out of the theater because I didn't have parental guidance. This film is all I've been thinking about for months. So, in waiting I read the book. It rocked. Okay, September rolls around and I immeadiately purchase this film, first day. And when I watch, I nod for the first hour or so, not a bad adaption. But as soon as the film nears the end everything falls apart. Kind of makes me wonder wheteher Kasdan even read the ending. Everythin has changed for the worst. What happened to the big ""Duddits is our Dreamcatcher ending?"" Instead of this deep meaning they go for something like Duddits is really an alien. What is this crap? My advice, if you have to se the movie, don't read the book first. You'll be thorugly disappointed. I know I was."
3,Confusing,"I'm not a fan of Stephen King's work so I was a bit hesitant to rent this movie. And the fact that the movie had aliens in it didn't make me want to see it. However, I did rent it and I must say that it wasn't all that bad. Stephen King has a certain style; foul language and confusing storylines. This movie had both. Four childhood friends, all with special abilities, agree to meet on the weekend at a cabin when they are trapped by a blizzard. Challenged to stop an alien force, the friends must first prevent the slaughter of innocent civilians by the military, then overcome a threat to the bond between them."
3,Stand By Me Meets A Low Budget Alien Flick. 3 STARS.,"Yes, I also wondered what the deal was with the alien having a Prince Charles accent! I agree with the other reviewer who stated that the first half of this movie was decent, worth watching. At first you have to laugh at how overdone the farting was here, I mean wasn't it enough to have to hear the the fat guy in the hunting cap blowing away, but we then have to hear the woman in the snow blasting at it.I'll say this: this was much more entertaining than The Storm of The Century, It, and The Stand. There's so many other bad Kind adaptations, you get my point.I kept this DVD and give it three stars, because it's one of those movies that aren't that bad when there's absolutely nothing else on to watch. With that said, I think any fans who haven't, should read the book and notice what was left out.Still a half-ways decent addition to your King collection.3 STAR RATING From Scraggy's Tomb of Horror, USA."
2,A Typical King Horror Flick,"This was a sadly typical horror flick; in all fairness I don't like horror flicks and at first didn't realize this was one of them. It didn't take long for the movie to clearly identify itself as a movie devoted to blood and gore.If you're really into horror movies you may enjoy this one; for those of us who don't, this is a great one to skip!"
2,"Cliche', cliche', cliche.......","Starts good, but fall on it's face past half of the movie. Definitely another Stephen King film. Never again."
5,Get over it already,"This isn't the book, how can it be? Get over it already. I've read the book. As a long time SK fan, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Why are you making comparisons? SK hardly ever contributes much to a movie based on one of his novels. Why are you bashing him? I dare say by the time a movie adaptation of one his novels hits the big screen, he's sick of the story and written four of five more new ones. That being said, I went in with no expectations and enjoyed the movie. It is a small group of people's interpretation of what that story (those people, that place) might look like. If everything was meant to be taken verbatim then I imagine Stephen King would have done it himself. Do yourselves a favor; put your expectations in the trash. You'll probably have a lot more fun in life."
5,dvd,"Creepy Stephen King movie. I bought this as a gift for someone who had wanted this, and they love it. So if you are looking for something for that King fan, this might be it."
3,It's like Alien except they crawl out your butt instead bursting out your chest!,"I saw this movie a long time ago and I wasn't really that crazy about it, but it does have it's moments and the butt-weasel aliens are pretty funny. I mentioned it to my girlfreind a couple of times and thought it would be easier to just watch the movie with her than to try to explain it. I only bought it because there aren't any video rental stores around anymore and I haven't seen it on cable. Even if there is a video store in your area, you can probably just buy this movie for a little more than it would cost you to rent it. It's not a bad movie by any means, the cast is good, the effects are okay and the story is pretty unique."
5,I love this movie,"Great cast. Jason Lee is so funny. Morgan Freeman is not his typical self. And Donnie Wahlberg is nearly unrecognizable, but fabulous in the role."
1,Worst movie EVER!,"When the guy took out a gun and used it as a phone I knew there was no saving this movie. Why did the evil alien speak with a British accent? Why did the good alien take on the form of a retarded boy and let people undress him stuff dog poop in his mouth? Why did the good alien invite his friend out into the path of speeding traffic? This movie has flashback scenes to when a group of friends were once young children. Hello? Wasn't this done already back in ""IT""? This movie is horrible. There is nothing good about it. The acting is horrible. The special effects are horrible. The story is the worst part. What was Morgan Freeman thinking?"
1,A stupid movie,"I don't like it. The story sounds unoriginal. I saw the summary to the book (which I have not read and never will), and I can say that it is one of King's worst ideas. The movie's plot is worse. I advise you to stay away and never watch this crap."
1,review part 2,"why are there people demanding we read the book first?!?!?!?!?!?a movie is what a movie is.WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE LIMITS MOVIES HAVE/BOOKS DONT.that doesnt excuse the movie version to be awefull as this certainly was.look at the hannible movies,both are brilliant.exorcist,jaws,some of kings books have been adapted quite well.BUT THIS!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?and how could you mr. freeman allow yourself to be part of such junk??????????what i hate most about movies is the fact that the audience are forced to take for granted what the directors claim to be a plot.example;why does drowning(maybe)give jason super human strength?ok,we are forced to take it.BELEIVEABLITY is key to any/every movie(comedies not included)if all involved couldnt make the movie version somewhat as good as the book,then why do it all?no,one doesnt have to read book before watching movie.one wont help the other.ONLY NOT MAKING THIS WOULD MAKE THIS A GOOD MOVIE.AGAIN,YOU DONT HAVE TO READ BOOK FIRST.sheesh!!!!!!!!"
1,people who think this is good should dream on,"This movie was bad from the beginning. From the onset the dialogue is jarring and unnatural. Many parts of the plot are unexplained and you're left with a general feeling of, ""huh?"" I hope, for the future generations of movies watchers, that this film is never aired again. It is sad that there are so many talented actors in the film, such as Morgan Freeman (he's the reason to watch this), because their skills are wasted. I now know to look a movie up on Amazon before renting or buy the video."
2,"Horrible, All Around!!!","First of all I am not even sure if this movie had a plot at all. I fell asleep through most of this movie. The character development was horrible. Whenever I decide to watch a King movie I set my expectations low, because lets face it most of them aren't very good. I set my expectations very low and I still was disappointed. I recommmend tht you read the book. I can't even really recommend this movie to King fans because I am afraid it will disappoint fans and non-fans alike."
2,Dreamcatcher (Widescreen Edition) (2003)-Sci-fi's first ugly look behind the bathroom door!,"Dream Catcher (Widescreen Edition) (2003) could have been a good sci-fi experience for me but our first glimpse behind the bathroom door was just too unsightly, even for a die hard Steven King fan like me. As such, I can not rate this film at higher than 2 stars. If this visually explicit scene could have been eliminated I am sure I would have liked this film and rated it at least 3 to 4 stars.It was enough to demonstrate that the creature gestated in the digestive tract of its host by the difficulty the victim had with eating and the resulting rude noises. The audience didn't need the very explicit lesson in Digestive Diseases. That scene aside, there was much I liked about the remainder of this movie. Pardon me for my sensibilities. I am still a Steven King fan but feel he should have stopped short at the Bathroom door since crossing that ugly threshold added nothing essential to the film."
4,Stephen King still scary as ever,"""Dreamcatcher"" was adapted from the book by the king of horror, Stephen King. Like all his books/movies, he takes an ordinary event and twists it to something original and supernatural. This movie remains one of the more unique works filmed. Its plot, which ties to one another smoothly, was written creatively. The writers offer the audience many unexpected twists and turns that keep their eyes wide open anxiously awaiting for what will happen next. Morgan Freeman, Tom Sizemore, Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Donnie Wahlberg, and many others act their roles wonderfully. The special effects, especially the alien make-up and the design, were crafted realistic-looking, giving ""Dreamcatcher"" the added scary effect. Fans of Stephen King should watch this movie. It'll become a never-forgotten experience."
1,"Dreadful. I'll never recover those 2 precious, wasted hours","This is perhaps the worst big-budget horror film I've ever seen.I'm just surprised these guys didn't realize what a horrible turkey they had on their hands and sent it straight to video. At least then they could salve their pride. This movie is crude, It's got enormous, ridiculous plot holes. It's basically unwatchable for anyone who hasn't read the book.My sense is that this is a monster movie masquerading as science fiction, but it's just not smart enough to be convincing in either genre. The script is just too thin, and disjointed, despite being amazingly long.Lawrence Kasdan is the writer for 'The Empire Strikes Back and is a legendary talent - I'm sure this project was sold on his famous name, so this is a professional tragedy of sorts. Hopefully this isn't his last work."
2,"Nothing special here, move along","Many things in the movie do not connect. A lot of things in the beginning have absolutely nothing to do with the outcome at the end. If you're going to place events in a movie, then place them there for a reason!The story is done in a way that tries to make the movie special, but it turns out to be just another ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" type of movie. This is good to watch one time, but after that you won't want to watch it over and over again. Spend your money on something else."
2,Disappointing,"This movie could have been so much better. It started out fairly well but just didn't hold together after the initial introduction. The movie lost me completely in the bathroom scene. You've got a monster trapped in the toilet, but that toothpick on the floor is out of your reach, and you need it so badly that you let the monster out to get it? You have to ask yourself, ""What's WRONG with this person?""Morgan Freeman's performance in this movie was also a big disappointment. He's such a talented actor, but here he seems to be just going through the motions. His character just falls flat. And as noted in an earlier review, the hair and eyebrows make him look silly and cartoonish.No big surprises in the final battle sequence. You pretty much know by this point who the two sides are going to be. But that last little bit after the fight - whose idea was that? I just wanted to shout at the television, ""What? NO! That CAN'T be the end!"" What a let-down."
2,"Not great but if you have time to kill, okay.","I didn't really care for this movie but it's not the worst I have seen. If you liked the book, then you will probably feel the same as I do.The movie just misses way too much of the story and the ending is completely horrible. I watched this because I really liked the book and was hoping that this would be somewhat worthy but it is not. Why are so many movies that are made from Stephen King stories so off? His books are incredible (one of my favorite authors) but the movies are mostly flat. I think they miss out on the feelings that King displays so well in his characters.I'd recommend reading the book and skipping this movie all together."
2,typical Stephen King,"This movie reminds me of almost all movies Stephen Kings been associated with--it starts great and is really interesting for the first third--barely holds your interest for the second third-and falls apart by the final third. As he too frequently does-there's a gifted ""special"" person who plays a significant role in the movies outcome. That doesn't ruin the movie--but the covert military operation which is headed by Morgan Freeman is a total waste and takes what little suspense is left in the movie and thows it out for good.The concept was good--some friends are isolated, and encounter a stranger who has a mysterious ailment--and that part of the story is quite entertaiining, but the ending is lame and ruins the initial story line. Suspense and horror are replaced by mayhem and firepower. Is it worth watching--sort of--but is it worth owning--no way!"
1,DISAPOINTING AT BEST,"If I had not read the book this movie would have made little or no sense at all, (not that it was very understandable even having read the book). A great book which could have been a great movie, but never achieved the promise of the cast, or story. I was really looking forward to the film being a ""constant reader"" as Mr. King calls us, to the conflict between good and evil, the Duddits connection (from watching the movie you have no idea of what the connection between him and the other boys/men was). The story line was choppy, trying to fill in the gaps with a few flashback scenes, you never really got the point that Mr. Gray had taken over one of the friends, (they had to have a character tell you this so you knew what was happening). The lack of detail in the second half of the movie was confusing, and the new ending was a disappointment."
2,I should have just read the book,Dreamcatcher wasn't a horrible movie but maybe if I had read the book I would have gotten a better feel for the film. The film is long and drawn out and never really expalins what's going on. Jason Lee's performance is what saved the film for me. Kudos also go to Thomas Jane who just appeared in the vastly superior The Mist. I guess I will read the book and then view the film again. I would say the film is for die hard King fans only.
1,"Loved the movie, but....","the DVD froze up on us in the same spot each time we tried to play it. Didn't matter what we tried to do to get past the spot, it was froze up only about a third of the way through the movie. We had looked all over for this movie as we loved it and watched it whenever it came on cable tv, but wanted a copy of our own. Were very disapointed with the quality of the DVD, and also with the return policy. My question is, how do you know the DVD is of bad quality until you open it and play it??"
1,What's this?,"Stephen King is a very good writer and he can make you feel scared, but whn they adapt a book to the movies they only make trash. People full of manias and fears, people with faces of fake fear and trying to make you scared, and non-sense flashbacks. Since ""The Shine"" no movie had success in movies. And Morgan Freeman can't save the movie."
4,You Got Worms!,"4 Stars = ClassicThe critics mostly dumped on this film. I thought it was a well constructed, acted, sci-fi/horror film, that really got the short end of the proverbial stick, poked right in the eye, or any orifice available.The cinematography is quite stunning, the special effects done very well. The storyline is very good, as far as these type of movies go. Some pretty good gore scenes that help build dread & suspense of being isolated in the deep woods in mid winter, with no help insight. Then when help is found, things even get worse. Though the military, government actions in this film are clichéd, but then again, that's what these films are comprised of, almost 100% of the time. It's not whether it's a new idea, but how well that idea is executed in the film. Here it works.Interesting characters & plot twists, make ""Dreamcatcher"" worthy of a nightmare!"
4,*Good Movie!*,"I liked this movie.It was interesting.I wanted to see what was going to happen next.I know alot of people have said bad things about it,however you have to watch it and judge for yourself."
2,Very disappointing,"I love horror films and tend to be extremely forgiving of even the worst schlock, but Dreamcatcher is truly a disappointment. Upon first viewing there were aspects of this film that I enjoyed, but the more I thought about it... the less any of it made sense. The plot is convoluted, the characters are wasted, and the alien fungus-monsters seem to have the psychic ability to create massive plot holes wherever they roam.Stephen King cannabalized half a dozen of his previous works to produce this self-plagiarism, and the movie adaptation is even worse. I have seen (and own) some of the worst movies ever made, and I enjoy them greatly -- but Dreamcatcher does not merit a second viewing... or a first, for that matter."
3,"Strange, Not scary.","The Dream Catcher was a ok, not very scary. Made me jump once or twice, but from sudden movement or sound. It was a little pointless. And I was disappointed in how the movie turned out. I kinda wish i hadn't bought it."
2,No No No No No,How disappointing. Its extremely rare when you see a film that is faithful to the novel. Apparently they didn't want to remain faithful to story. Can someone please make a good adaptation of a stephen king novel? Does any studio exist that will take the time to do this? Please lord. Good to see more upcoming actors like Jason Lee and Timothy Olyphant get more screen time although the film doesn't do them much justice. Watch this one with no expectations and you may like it. That and I hope you didn't read the novel first.
2,"Interesting, but not if you like Stephen King","OK... so every now and then there is a movie that comes out that may be okay in it's own right, but has next to no similarities to the story on which it was based. I have been a Stephen King fan for years and have always made a point of reading his books before seeing any of the movies. I enjoyed the book, the story was great... I'm not sure what they screenplay writers read, but it was NOT the book. They got some of the basic plotline and such, but there was almost no character development (and where there was, it was wrong... totally different from the actual chracters in the book) and they must have been bored with their own work by the end, because what they put in for an ending was very simply made up. They missed the entire point of the book and went WAY off track. So if you like Stephen King, don't bother. If you like campy ""B"" movies and have never read a Stephen King book in your life... you may just like it."
2,"Great book, Lousy Movie","Stephen King should pass up the money and not let his novels be made into movies. It never works out right. The one decent movie made from one of his books ( The Shining ), he hates.This movie is great for the brief period of time that it follows the novel. The first act where you are introduced to the characters could not have been done better. The casting is great as well as the initial build up of suspense. The problem is that when the aliens are finally introduced, the movie tries to go over the top with cliched military conspiraccies and surprise twists when a subtle hand is what is needed. The ending is the most rediculous thing I have ever seen.Don't waste your time or money on this. Check out the book from the library and leave it at that."
2,"Dreamcatcher, catches a nightmare","I'm a huge fan of anything Stephan King, that being said I'm embarassed for him for having put his name on this movie. I've read the book and this movie is a huge disappointment. This movie has none of the depth or character developement of the book. You don't get a sense of the friendships, why they work, how or why they've lasted this long. The intorduction of the binding facgor of these friendships (the man child they saved a pre-teens)was sloppy at best, and pretentious at worst.If you haven't read the book then you might fine this movie (and I use the term losely) entertaining. But I highly doubt it."
1,Heed the Warnings,"DreamCatcher is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As a longtime Stephen King fan, I ignored the warnings. Fortunately, I didn't have to pay to see this dog! It is the most vulgar/graphic movie I have ever seen. Obviously it is made for the 8-12 yr. old set, as only they can appreciate flatulence, belching, gaping [...] wounds, slime, blood, guts and the sheer tastelessness of the movie. Should you actually persevere to the end, it turns very cartoonish and explains very little. A much better alien film, with suspense, is John Carpenter's ""The Thing"""
1,Terrible,"I lied ... this movie actually gets zero stars, but this rating system wasn't built for movies as bad as this one, therefore it unofficially gets a 1. In fact, you can't even describe this movie as being bad. It would have to improve by about 800% just to become bad. At no point is this movie even close to being watchable. When I saw this movie, I had slept for 15 hours that day, and was all hyper due to being so well rested. However, it put me to sleep again in about 5 mins. The only reason I woke up was because of a loud farting sound, apparently caused by aliens crawling up people's butts. Then I stayed awake long enough to have the honor of seeing some kid pick up a dog turd. Afterwards, I forced myself back to sleep. Don't watch this movie."
1,Bad Dream.,"An absolute nightmare. A film filled with unecessary cruelty and poor storytelling. Stephen King has written better tales and has had his name attatched to better projects. Is this the same Kasdan who co-wrote ""The Empire Strikes Back?"" This mess leaves a bad taste. The worst film of 2003."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.,"I cannot believe this movie got made, with decent actors no less. Don't waste your time watching this movie, unless you enjoy senseless, annoying, and incredibly moronic writing. Movies produced using the works of Stephen King are typically quite awful. The only exceptions include movies that are based on short stories and movies that he himself did not have much to do with. This probably has something to do with the fact that he churns out mindless works one after another, much to the delight of his lowest common denominator audience. Save yourself the time and watch Magnolia."
2,"Tosh, but it has its moments","This movie really isn't sure what it wants to be. Part Independence Day, part X-Men, and part Alien, it even makes references in passing to another Stephen King story, Stand By Me.Essentially the film can be divided into two halves -- the enigmatic first half where four thirtysomethings make moderate use of their ESP capabilities on their way through their professional lives, one flashback to 20-years-ago, towards a mid-winter cabin destination. In the second half, we get the ridiculous Alien/Independence Day sub-plot, with Morgan Freeman being forced to swear (frequently) in order to convince us that he's not the same endearing character from Se7en and the Shawshank Redemption.In the end, the Earth is saved -- my apologies if that ruins it for anyone -- but this dog's dinner should retain your attention for about an hour. Once the aliens turn up and start visiting people's bottoms, don't feel embarrassed about reaching for the fast-forward button."
1,BORING,"THIS MOVIE REALLY SUCKED it wasnt scary what-so-ever, whoever thinks this movie is good, you are on crack....The Ring, now there's a good movie"
3,"Entertaining, suspenseful, though unrealistic","I have not read this book so did not know what to expect with the movie. I was reasonably entertained by the characters and their dialogue. It becomes creepy and sort of trite when the aliens show up and start incubating in and inhabiting human bodies. The story remains suspenseful, as long as you don't try to reason too much and logically explain the events occurring.It includes the usual alien activity. The take over humans, hatch in humans, exercise mind control, hijack cars, etc. The aliens in this movie are vicious but have a sense of humor.Morgan Freeman lends authenticity to the story but still does not make it realistic.I think you can expect to entertained and creeped out bu don't expect any meaningful story or realism when it comes to the aliens' involvement. It is a mix of many of King's previous movies, the good and the bad."
1,The Worst I've Ever Seen,"It wasn't just gross or stupid...it was stupidly gross! I finished it - thinking it would get better and begin to make sense - on the contrary. Dreamcatcher is a misnomer, it should be titled Butt Weasels."
1,The Poorest 2 Hour Adaptation of a Sci Fi Novel,"I read this book recently while traveling - like most Stephen King novels, the book holds the reader's attention - with sufficient descriptions, narratives and character development. Unfortunately, this adaptation significantly deviates from the story's plot, is not a true representation of how the tale is told in King's novel. In fact, there are several scenes that are not representative of anything in the novel and the distortion of a solid sci fi/horror story is very disappointing. If you've read the book I'm sure that you'll find yourself numerous times wanting to turn off the movie and retain your fond memories of a good read."
1,what in the h*ll??????,"Is this movie about and what I did not understand was what aliens had to do with indian dreamcatchers??? The movie starts out well but about 45 minutes into it loses its focus and plot and everything else.......My fiance and I could not even finish the movie, King should have focused more on a different plot line without aliens, and been more involved with the childhood friends and their little ""odd"" friend. The past scenes with them as kids was the only really entertaining thing about this movie and I wish there had been more like the story in the movie with the evil clown (cant remember the name).This movie was awful."
1,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE SEEN THIS YEAR,"ONE DAY DURING THEIR CHILDHOOD, A GROUP OF FRIENDS SAVE A YOUNG BOY FROM SOME BULLIES. IN RETURN, THEY GET AN AMAZING POWER THAT ALLOWS THEM TO KNOW THINGS. WHEN THEY REUNITE DECADES LATER, THEY MUST USE THIS POWER TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM A MENACE LIKE NO OTHER. I TRYED TO GIVE THIS A CHANCE, BUT THIS MOVIE IS UNDENIABLY BORING. MUCH OF THIS MOVIE IS POINTLESS. IT TRYS TO GET EXCITING TOWARD THE END, BUT IT WAS WAY TOO LATE TO SAVE THIS TIME-WASTER. THE WHOLE CAST IS WASTED, ESPECIALLY MORGAN FREEMAN, WHO PLAYS AN ALIEN HUNTER. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BORING HORROR/SCI-FI MOVIES I'VE SEEN IN YEARS. AND TO THINK THAT THIS GOD AWFUL MOVIE WAS BASED ON A STEPHEN KING NOVEL IS VERY UNBELIEVABLE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH. BELIEVE ME, IT'S DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT."
1,"Recipe for disaster...er, Dreamcatcher","Stand By Me, Men in Black, Independence Day, Outbreak, What Dreams May Come, the segment of Creepshow with fast-reproducing alien fungus, any Toxic Avenger movie, Deliverance, Forrest Gump.Frappe' 'em all together in a blender and strain away most of the entertainment value and plot line conclusions. Add a dash of poor acting and cheesey, unconvincing dialogue. Garnish with special effects.Voila, you've created Dreamcatcher. Watch and TRY to enjoy, though it's doubtful you will."
1,This move is stupid,"Ok, stayed up until 1AM watching this piece of garbage last night, and boy, was it a waste of time! As the description says, it's a hodge-podge of almost every Stephen King story out there: aliens, telepathy, four guys going down a railroad track to find a missing kid - NO I'm not kidding, grown-up friends haunted by the events of their youth, etc. etc. etc. And the worst part is, NONE of it works together. It's a complete mess, and by the time you get to the end, you find yourself saying, ""Oh, come on! You have GOT to be kidding me!""I think it really says something about this movie that the alien 'worms' exit through the rear ends of their victims."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, and if I could, I would give it no stars. It even insults the average action/horror fan's intelligence or appreciation for some type of entertainment. I mean, this wasn't even engaging in any way, shape or form. Actually, I take that back, Donnie Wahlberg as a retard was pretty funny."
1,It sucks and it's boring.,"At first, the movie seems pretty good and shows some potential. But then it slows down...way down...and then picks up a little bit with some ass-aliens, then mashes in some kind of crazy-general alien hunter side plot and also explores what it might be like inside the memory banks of a person. The movie is just so slow and so boring that I practically fell asleep watching it. The ending, which I won't spoil, had me laughing out loud (the best part of the movie for the wrong reason). I thought, ""Hey, what if that retard was..."" and then it happened. A classically bad horror ending at it's worst."
3,Not Stephen King's Best,"We watched this last night, and I am an avid Stephen King fan. I read the book when it first came out and was unimpressed. I have been unimpressed by most of his recent (5-10 years) stuff. But the book was a pleasant way to kill some winter hours. The video was impressively true to the book. There are only two scenes I can think of that were missing from the movie, that were in the book (I'm sure there are more but I don't remember them): the approval of Duddits' mom from the get-go (in the movie we don't meet her until the end) and when Mr. Gray stops in a diner to eat for the first time in a human body (would have been a great scene).I think the movie was a good adaptation of a so-so/weird book. I prefer Stephen King's mind-thrilling twisting plots with plenty of down-to-earth irony and horror (like Christine, Carrie, Needful Things), not far-fetched sci-fi imagination with no catharsis."
2,Freeman & Lee,"All I can say is the three best things about this flim is actors = Morgen Freeman Jason Lee &Timothy Olyphant-Dreamcatcher (Widescreen Edition)If anyone thinks something else oh well, to each His/Her own."
2,First half good - last half very bad,The first part of this movie starts off great. It has a nice look and follows the plot in the book. Then in the middle of the movie it veers off into its own direction. The characters just don't make sense at that point.Perhaps the story would have been better told as a miniseries so the makers of the film wouldn't have had to cut corners.
2,"Don't , just don't....","This is a horror movie about poop. Yes, there are aliens and government conspiracies, but all the tension and horror in this movie revolves around the human digestional tract, bad gas, and the toilet. Still interested?The only kudos I will concede to this movie are: 1. I do like how Jonsey's mental warehouse was filmed. It did justice to the discription in the book. and 2. Yes, Duddits is played by ex-New Kid On The Block, Donnie Wahlberg. Considering how horrible his musical skills were, his acting is great.If you are still going to buy this DVD, check out the bonus feature that has an outtake of Owen, Duddits, and Henry in the car. It is almost hilarious enough to make the purchase worthwhile."
1,Dreamcatcher,Bad acting and cardboard characters aside - the profanity in this movie is nauseating. It's pretty bad when you have to buy the DVD so you can use the guardian filter just to watch the movie.
1,I walked out after 30 minutes...it was that BAD!,"I have NEVER walked out of a movie, however, I walked out of this one. This movie sucked so much. It would have not only been a waste of money, but time. I lost the money, but I sure as heck saved my time by walking out of the film."
3,Just your average flesh eating aliens slugs infection/,"We have this a special men in black team led by Morgan Freeman( not God or the President this time out?),and four telepathic friends of a ""retard""...All taking place in a forest hunting retreatwhere the aliens had the misfortune to crash.The government policy is nothing gets out of the zone alive.One of the fellows ( Jonesie) gets taken over by a gray man'smind control, but not completely.This battle is a horrible one of a Stephen King type..."
2,Another Letdown......,"I gave this movie 2 stars basically because of the gore and special effects. It's hard to believe that Morgan Freeman agreed to make this movie. This is one of those geez, what a letdown movie. (...), I'm sure the book was much better! Four friends, each with their own special powers, must come together to stop a entity that is trying to take their lives. Freeman plays a alien hunter. Not a true horror film. This is another one of those movies that I bought first ( cheap, thank goodness ) without renting it. I hope other people don't make the same mistake!!"
1,They really DUD IT!!!,"The script is worth $1, a little more than the other Stephen King novels-turned-to-movies.What does the dreamcatcher have to do with anything in the movie?"
1,........,"Please, if you have a brain do NOT buy this or rent this movie.Save yourself $25 if you're gunna buy it or Save yourself $3 if you're gunna rent it....most of all you don't want to waste 2 and a half hours of your life when you can be doing more important things that watching this horrible movie.I haven't read the book, but this movie was bad, and I am sure the book isn't too good as well. Stephen King is known for making horrible movies, very cheesey and...just ugh...this one was the worst ever!It seemed like an interesting movie at first, then it just went downhill after the first 20 mins.I cannot even think of why Morgan Freeman would take on such a stupid script...and also Jason Lee, he's not that great of an actor..but I like him and now...I don't know anymore. It's horrible! The Aliens must have gotten to Stephen King's readers/watchers cause I don't know who in the their right mind would rent/buy/read/watch anything by that man."
2,a disappointing deary dull thriller,"the movie takes a while for it to come into gear but when the alien invasion starts the characters start to use these telepathic powers that they got when they were kids, the movie is probably my least favourite stephen king movie and not something you would watch over and over again, the movie drags on alot and really isn't set out properly to fit in with the story in my opinion."
1,is this a comedy???,"This has to be one of the strangest mainstream films ever made, but i'm not sure that was entirely intentional. The first part of the movie sets things up well - classic chiller you might say (strange virus, atmospeheric Maine woods). Why then did the producers decide to turn the rest of the film into a made for tv b-movie? Damian Lewis's possession is hilarious, but is this the intended effect? You're left in little doubt that the film makers must be having fun with the audience when the next part of the film plays like some dreaful Independence day type nonsense, with Morgan Freeman completely wasted - he feels tagged on. And after all this, watching the end credits would make you think you'd just been watching Ghostbusters. This is a dreaful but enjoyable film."
3,Cute film,I don't think the film was worth the money. It was cute at certain moments. The film was too slow. It wasn't enjoyable for me to watch how a persin with mental illness was treated at the time. See more at [...]
4,Well done movie about an intriguing historical theme...,"This movie is a superb historical attempt to portray the Madness of King George III of England. It takes place shortly after the American Revolution, and combines a couple incidents in King George's life into a condensed time period. Although not 100% historically accurate, it is superbly done. Great acting, cast and sets. Nice movie for those interested in the time period or historically themed movies."
2,More a drama than a comedy,"""The Madness of King George"" is far from an excellent movie and a must see but nevertheless it's still both fun and wonderful to watch. The costumes and sets are great and Sir Nigel Hawthorne really carries the movie with his wonderful performance.The film starts slow - v e r y s l o w - and I almost shut it off. What surprised me after seeing this movie, was that it was more a drama than a comedy. There is nothing in the dialogue that is interesting, or poetic, or transcendent, or makes you think. None of the acting was particularly outstanding; the performances have been vastly overrated. All in all, you can do much worse."
2,Contains multiple choice/exam-type questions and a key only.,"This book only contains multiple choice/exam type questions and a key to the correct answers, there are no explanations. This book assumes that you have studied the principles and use of MRI technology."
2,wrong answers,I'm taking the MRI registry tomorrow & I've been studing several pieces of material. I believe there are wrong answers in this study guide. Guess we'll find out tomorrow.
2,a who done it let down,"If you want to see someone post some woman against a wall and grind like he's going out of his silly mind, you might like this one. I personally didn't. The sex is simulated and all the main character does is lie to his wife and 'poke' every woman he sees. He ends up with a close call, which makes you disgusted with him all together. I hate myself for buying this movie. As a matter of fact, there is no movie. It's stupid sex that isn't even real."
2,Soft Porn crap,"This movie is really abysmal. Apart from its promise that it would satisfy everyone's bestial desires, this movie fails on every level. It's filmed on digital video, thus the picture quality is questionable. The acting is the pits and the lead actor is just too old and craggy to be someone credible enough to be a casanova. Utter crap, even if the movie is put under the Hong Kong Category 3 genre."
1,"Absurd movie -- must have been ""rent-due"" day in L.A.","Disgusting scenes of excess violence toward women and fake orgasms all around make this ridiculous farce seem like a soft-core version of every Porn King's first feature film. As a further insult, the viewer is subjected to tortuous ""analysis"" via a Rogerian psychiatrist. The featured ""actor"" looks like a janitor in a West Virginia high school; Rosanna Arquette and Alexandra Paul, who cannot be made to look ugly, nevertheless turn in performances that are spoofs of every bad acting class. These people must have desperately needed the money. If they acted for royalties, then their earnings will be about right. Zero."
1,trashy,"I truely wished I would of read the reveiws on this movie before buying it.The artwork looked pretty Trusting,and enticing,But way to much Profanity.The sex scenes were awfull.The only good part was that Beautifull Brunette that they sent up to the guys room just a little toward the end of the movie.But take my advice RENT this before buying..Or atleast read the other reviews.."
1,can it be worse ?,"don't want to waste much time on this but it is really not a movie . only a mindless and desperate wife will try to force her husband to watch this for saving their marrige . unless , nobody will tell you it's good . i wasted my money only on natasha kinki but this useless dvd almost made me hate her forever . one star is really too much !"
5,He didn't have to drink the kool aid,"In addition to being a compelling, insightful account of the merger announcement and ensuing proxy fight, Backfire gives a wonderful glimpse into the heart and soul of the most powerful woman in American business. Especially when it comes to the Lucent anecdotes and the revealing moments after she first arrived at HP, Burrows provides a rich tapestry of insight and examples that allow you to truly get your mind around (and inside) what makes Carly tick.With a wealth of interview material to draw from obtained prior to the HP's decision to freeze him out, what this tome does without compromise is maintain its sense of impartial perspective -- a never wavering eye on the events of the past and present. No deal had to be struck and no compromises made in order to deliver this saga, and it is far more fascinating, honest, and revealing without those concessions."
2,Journalism?,"The main tragedy of this book is that Burrows is a horrible journalist. The title of the book should read: ""Why I don't like Carly Fiorina"". This reader can't help but have the feeling that had jr. Hewlett denied Burrows access and Fiorina granted more interview time, he would sing her praises. In one way, I can speculate to how Burrows empathizes with jr. Hewlett, they both are guilty of sitting on the sideline, being righteous in their distant criticisms, and both are severely lacking any accountability. Now if I could just go back in time pick the book up at the library instead of putting my money towards the book's sales figures..."
1,A poorly written story that just does not hold up,"It is clear that this book was rushed through to follow onto some of the sensational headlines of the HP/Compaq acquistion battle. The story is so spotty and incomplete that it is apparent that the author must not have had time to do his homework for the book. Also, I wonder what kind of editor rushed this book to press. I found several blatant inconsistencies and contradictions of the facts presented in the book(like where Carly was working at certain times). It is a shame that people will probably read this and take it to be the truth."
4,"Yes Chicago, IL - we are legion.","After reading the reviewer from Chicago, please take the time to read Mr Babinski's full comments. I read a library copy of this book and have now placed it on my birthday list. It's greatest value is for people like me, ex born again Christians. 'Chicago, IL' can't imagine the other side of the great divide you pass through when you 'come out' of Christianity, but WE know and Mr Babinski's subjects do. If you once loved Jesus, worshipped him and shared the gospel with others but now find yourself in a wilderness, take heart! This book is a great first step to discovering 1)You're not alone in this experience and 2)A joyful and rewarding life still awaits you."
5,a great book!,"Thanks, Ed, for this wonderful book.I cannot overemphasize its importance in comforting me after my own deconversion from fundamentalist Christianity.A word to the review by Victor S. Taber: only one year ago I thought exactly like he does -- but now I can only say that nothing could be further from the truth -- his Bible-quotations are completely misplaced concerning people who ""left the fold"": they aren't backsliders, they just started to face the immense problems in fundy Christian's worldview!"
5,cool,"this gun is the best. It has great aiming, fire power , and range. I recomend this gun to anyone!"
5,Just a Bad Day,"I just love these ""little Critter"" books. They're cute and easy for toddlers to relate to. Coming from a small person, having oatmeal for breakfast might just be a reason for a bad day. Again, this is a toddler book and I don't think kids will expect to be given a toy every time they have a bad day."
2,No comfort for a bad day,"I find the Little Critter books cute...most of the time. This book however I threw away. While the critter is having a bad day but throughout the book his mother never one holds and comforts him, and in the end the thing that changes his bad day is the fact that his dad bought him a new toy. There are no real solutions on how to handle a bad day, just the lesson that id you are feeling bad maybe someone can buy you something and make you feel better.Grover's bad, awful day by Anna H. Dickinson is a much better choice."
4,Hard to find book!,"This book has been out of print for quite some time, but I was lucky enough to have had a teacher in high school that made numerous xerox copies of it. She assigned everyone to read it and it was excellent! I hope this is the book that I read b/c ""Whom the Gods Would Destroy"" is the title."
4,Good choice,"I enjoyed this album. I bought it on a whim after it was on the listening station at my local store. It's really a great album, albeit a little dumbed-down musically. A good choice if you're looking to expand your horizons."
2,Don't believe the good reviews,"In short, don't believe all the things that other reviewers on Amazon are saying about this amp. I've had it for about 3 years, and it is not worth it. If you are new to electric guitar, you may think that the Spider sounds good, but if you have had experience with amps you will know that it's no good. It sounds digital and cheesy. There is absolutely no warmth to the sound at all. This amp only sounds good to the untrained ear."
5,Holy Crap!,"I am new to the world of electric guitars, but have been playing acustic for a couple of years now. So I bought a new Fender Stratocaster, and this amp. All I can say is holy crap this thing is awesome. I don't even know what 3/4 of the little knobs do, all I know is that I can spend hours a day messing around and creating totally crazy sounds. And this thing is LOUD, I've only had the balls to turn it a little past 1/2 way....when I did this I tried playing and talking to my wife and it was useless, she couldn't hear a word I was saying. I can't imagine 3/4 volume or all the way power. Since I don't have any experience with effect pedals I really can't comment on how the built in effects measure up, but to a rookie they sound pretty cool. I'm not sure I will ever understand all of the features or how to use them like a professional, but that's why I bought this amp cause I figured it would be hard to grow out of for a casual player with no aspirations of performing in public."
4,the line 6 beast! :],"well, this is my opinion i absolutley love it, its so versatile, i own this and a bugera 333xl the bugera still sounds better just because of the warmth of the tubes, but thi is the best for any beginner guitar player, id recommend it for anyone! :]"
5,Brillant!,"I think this album is brilliant and have been listening to it for years! Thank you, Mr. Russell."
4,Fine cheap Saw,"It's not exciting, but you'll never have to worry about it. This saw does a fine job, cuts smoothly enough, and can be thrown away when it dulls. For the price it is a fine addition to the shop. Just don't confuse it with a premium tool. I have used it to clean up several through tenons and dowels and it's still sharp. I'm satisfied."
4,its ok,"ok, its sharp.for cutting off small things like dowels it works fine. for trimming off larger peices, like thick edge banding it can be tricky for getting a straight cut because the blade is so flexible. as for cutting dovetails with this... good luck. it will flex too much to get really straight cuts even using your finger or piece of wood to guide it. it would be good for cleaning cuts & corners out though."
5,I love this little saw!,"This is one damn handy little saw. I use it for dovetails and trimming dowels, mostly. The blade is flexible, the saw is lightwieght and very easy to use. Best of all, the blade is replaceable and affordable. I don't think you can go wrong with one of these."
3,Nicely made,"But you'll want something else for cuts the are mostly in rip direction. Blade binds and is a bit too flexible for some tasks,but great for others. Stanley makes a better set blade, with a useless tang and handle. Wish I could combine the two.I'll keep this tool, for a few jobs it's been perfect, but not as broadly useful as I'd hoped. Still looking for that perfect single saw forcedar strip boat building"
4,It did the job.,"I had a drawer that fell everytime you pulled it out - very irritating. I purchased a drawer rail at home depot, and it was a left side rail which did not work. I purchased this through Amazon to avoid the hassle of looking at the store. Now my drawer works great. No complaints."
4,A big Western with a stupendous music score.,"I loved this movie as a kid when I saw it in the theatre back in 1958 or 1959 and I still love it. The movie score by Jerome Morass is absolutely magnificent. Gregory Peck plays a pacifist Easterner who's trying to avoid getting caught up in the land dispute his fiance's (Carol Baker) family is having with a local clan. His shallow fiance and her father (Charles Bickford) interpret his unwillingness to fight as a sign of weakness. Charlton Heston and the beautiful Jean Simmons are fine in their roles. Burl Ives won an Oscar for his portrayal of Rufus Hennesey, the leader of a very large extended family. Last, but not least, Chuck Connors (of the Rifleman TV series) turns in his finest film performance. A big movie with big stars made by a big-time director (William Wyler who won best director Oscars for Ben-Hur and The Best Years of Our Lives). A fine film with a good message about the futility of fighting in order to resolve conflicts."
4,The Big Country,This movie was an excellent view of what the feud between The Hatfields and The McCoys began. Only disaster can come from the hatred that festers over the years. Good cinematographry and well acted by a great cast.
4,THE BIG COUNTRY,"Great transfer on to B/R and watching this last night on a 150 inch screen was like seeing a first night screening at the cinema. Great story,acting and I think everybody involved from making this film in the first place to new B/R transfer have given me a great deal of pleasure for a 5 star western/film. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. And at a great price."
4,Great Western,"Cast is great - good to see an early Heston in a Western role. A little long, but very enjoyable."
3,"Good flick, but stretched","This is a fine movie in story, cinematography, acting and music. But as others have noted, it is stretched horizontally. It makes you wonder who they hire as video editors these days. If you do not notice such things, then it is not a problem. But it was immediately apparent to me from the opening credits with the horses in profile all the way through the movie. The most noticeable effect is that all the heads are clearly too broad in profile. And it is more annoying because of the dark letterbox bands at the top and bottom, which could have been shrunk to show more of the picture in the correct aspect ratio.It reminds me that I have never seen this problem on Netflix, and even if it occurs there you are not out any additional money. Blu-ray discs should be checked for higher quality, not shoved out the door."
1,Not playable in Australia,"This is the third one that will not play here in Australia, I orderd it from thr Australian site I was looking forward to watching this one again and world normally have given a 4 or 5 star rating depending on repduction quality.This movie is a classic and I believe it must have been a wrong delivery to Amazon as i do not believe that thay would make this kind of a mistake as my other moves do play and are of high quality.To Amazons credit they are refunding me."
5,The Big Country,"I haven't had a chance to see the blue ray version.However, it's a great movie and I know we will not be disappointed"
5,Should be rated as one of the best movies ever made.,"My father took me to see this movie soon after its release. The greatest value of The Big Country are the lessens taught regarding morality, ethics and having a personal code of conduct strong enough to sustain one during times of moral decisions. This movie should be required viewing for every youngster during their formative ages. It certainly had a positive impact on me and my children and I intend to see that my grandchildren have an opportunity to experience the message brought by ""The Big Country"". The musical score is superlative throughout and is simply unequaled by any other soundtrack. The overall performance by the entire cast, the wonderful scenery and this story has resulted in an all time classic we can repeatedly enjoy."
2,Great movie - BUT,"The picture and sound are great for this movie. The problems are with using aditional feature like pause, stop, start, etc. Maybe it is just my DVD player although I have never had trouble with any other DVD or Blu-ray. I had several interuptions when trying to watch the movie and every time I paused or stopped the movie I had to start over from the beginning. Pushing resume or play started at the beginning. I love the movie and liked the quality, but am marking it down because of the inability to control the playing. If you never pause and resume you are OK."
3,What happened to the opening?,"I bought this DVD because from experience I knew the color would be even better than the VHS. It was -- EXCEPT for the opening credits. There's supposed to be a copper/brown wash over the scenes of the stagecoach. That's how it was on both VHS issues (P&S and Wide). Here, it's BLACK-AND-WHITE! The aforementioned copper brown flashes on screen a couple of times, but otherwise b/w. The rest of the picture's color is fine. I checked on three DVD players, then took it in as defective. The replacement is the same, so obviously they released it this way. MGM didn't take very much care here. The film itself is still great, but what happened to the opening?"
1,Poor reproduction,"I love this movie but I hate this DVD. This had to have been copied by high school students, no professional could have done this poor of a job.I have this movie on VHS, on two tapes, and it looks like they copied it from the VHS rather than the original movie stock. The background fades in and out just enough to be noticeable, obviously someone didn't turn off the security feature all the way. In the middle of the movie there is a moment of very dark video similar to the VHS, which fades to black on the first cassette and then fades back in on the second.This is sad and I will make sure to never purchase from this production company again!"
3,Too bad this restoration is poor. This is the Blu-ray version.,"I was hoping for a great restoration, but.....no cigar. There is flicker that is very annoying and is noticable immediately. I moved from the standard playback to ""movie playback"", but there was no improvement. The music was low fidelity. It's too bad because it is so spectactular it raises the hair on my neck when rendered in high fidelity. It deserves the Oscar it won since it matches extremely well to each scene, and frankly is ""magic."" I cannot understand why master copies of this film were not saved. The necessity that so many restorations of wonderful films required bringing pieces and remnants together just makes me sad."
5,"The grand, epic-like movie that you somehow missed","This is one of the best movies that you've never seen and, maybe, never really heard about. You know the music, though, as this is one of the greatest movie scores ever written and will leave you thinking ""so this is where that music came from."" From the opening frame, the movie sweeps you off of your feet and doesn't set you down until ""The End."" Director William Wyler is an absolute master of the epic (though not strictly one, this film feels every bit like one). If you loved his Ben-Hur (which also had phenomenal music), you'll love this, too. It is, truly, one of the finest movies to come out of Hollywood, Western or not. I don't even have room to go on about the superb cinematography or acting. If you live for grand, sweeping dramas, definitely don't miss this."
3,MGM didn't do justice to The Big Country on DVD,"I was a little disappointed in the video transfer of The Big Country to DVD. This wasn't a great transfer as white spots and occassional film shivers in the picture occurred. Unfortunately, MGM seems to have joined the rush to market DVDs without taking the time and money to assure the film's fans of a good quality DVD version of the film. The movie is worth five stars, but the DVD version only three due to quality."
5,Its a big country!,"The Big Country is one of the best westerns ever made in my opinion. It's unique in that it doesn't have all of the shoot em' up good guy against bad guy spagetti western flavor. It focuses more on the different people and their surroundings, and also how their outlooks on life effect everything else.The thing that really sets this movie apart from a lot of westerns I have seen is the sheer magnitude in which it is shot. How ""big"" of a country that they film it to be. While watching this movie you feel like your actually there, you feel the immensity of it.Along with the good photography and amazing characters/actors, the music really kicks the movie into another level entirely. The musical score is powerful and helps set the mood of the entire movie.Set asside a couple of hours and enjoy it."
5,"absolutely spendid, action-packed, great love story",This movie is one of my most favorite. It has a good story line and a story within a story. The score is fabulous and you find yourself rooting for Gregory Peck at every turn. Recommend it highly for an action packed western!
4,My dog likes them,"My 10 month old Boxer puppy really likes these. They do have a stinky smell, but it doesn't waft throughout the house so it doesn't bother me. I wish they lasted longer. She makes pretty short work of them, and I'd really like to find a chew that would keep her busy longer than 15 minutes! Price was fairly reasonable in comparison to other similar products I've purchased."
5,Great treats for dogs!,"We have a little 35 pound pit/mix and he eats these in about 3 minutes. He grabs it, then goes to a certain spot on our rug to chew it up. So if you have a breed with a powerful set of jaws, you shouldn't have a problem with them stinking or being left around the house. Most dogs love these things, because they are more appetising, and easier to digest than rawhide (they are also more nutritious). Other great thing about these things, is that it helps clean their teeth, and lets them expend a bit of energy.A doggy's jaw needs some excercise, which it doesn't really get chewing on kibble. These make great treats. Our dog used to get separation anxiety when we left, but we started giving him treats right before leaving, and he'd go chew it up as we left, and he stopped getting getting anxious about us leaving."
3,Stinky Tendons,Unless your dog is an outside dog that lives outside and would be gnawing on these in your yard these beef tendons STINK. Their smell permeates the entire house. For that reason alone I would have a difficult time purchasing them again. Their odor is horrific.
3,Not as good as chicken sticks,"I have 6 little dogs so I know dog treats! I usually order the chicken sticks but thought I would give these beef sticks a shot. My dogs take them but then drop them on the floor, which is where they stay. But on the chicken sticks, they are gobbled up quickly, which reminds me, I need to order another barrel of those tasty treats today! As for this experiment, I won't buy them again, dogs know what they like and it isn't these sticks."
4,My dog loves these but....,"If your dog is a heavy chewer these are obviously tasty but not nearly as hard as bully sticks. If you want to give your dog a ""project"" while you are away from home I suggest you don't expect this product to substitute for the more expensive, heavy duty bully sticks. I keep these and the bully sticks in my freezer. The frozen bully stick keeps my labrador busy for a few hours. These treats are gone before my car has left the driveway. For the reviews that say this product is smelly, keeping it in the freezer in a freezer baggie solves that problem."
5,Great treat for your dog!,"These are made out of dried beef tendon, which besides being tasty for your pup, is great for their dental health. These are very competitively priced and are of high quality. The only drawback is that they are a little rich if you have a small dog, so I would limit to 1 a day if you do. More than that you could cause loose stool for your pup, but you get that with any rich treats you give your dog and is not unique to this item."
3,where made?,"I haven't purchased this but giving 3 stars because its description doesn't specify where they're made. There have recently been dogs dying from eating dried chicken products from China (such as those chicken wrapped apples and yam treats my dog loved so). That's not the first dog food product from there that there's been an issue with. From now on, just to be safe, I will only purchase USA products and I won't buy unless I know that's where it's made."
1,MADE IN CHINA!,"I googled these treats - as I now do for all pet snack products - and learned that these, too, have made the dreaded list of dog products made in China. Other reviewers who have taken the time to write about this spoiled, rancid garbage that has made their dogs ill are completely right. Sure, the imported treats are very cheap, but ones that are stamped A Product of China or Made In China, Taiwan, etc., should be avoided at any and all cost. The spoiled meats cause liver and kidney failure and are deadly because they are poison. Period."
1,Horrible,"I have already contacted the company that sells these and your company. These dog chews are horrible! I actually gagged when I opened the package. They smell like rotten beef. I didn't realize that they were made in another country either until I got them. They are not fit to feed to a rat. I am very upset about this and now trusting the companies you deal with. You can see that I buy much from amazon, and have never complained before. I believe I should be compensated for this terrible experience."
2,Smelly!,"Once I opened the package, there was a terrible smell resembling decay/rotting fish that came from these. I tried to ""air' them out to see if the smell would go away, only to have my next door neighbor tell me about a ""dead animal smell"" that she could smell all the way up from her 2nd floor apartment 300 feet away. Sure enough, I brought her over to where these were ""aerating"" and it was the culprit. (I guess the wind was blowing just right that day). I have purchased other products from this brand previously with no issues. But whatever this was, the smell was too awful to give to the dog."
1,Made my dog sick each time.,Dog threw up each time she ate one before we had to throw out. Not sure if it was just my dog but I wouldn't recommend for every dog.
2,Pieces are fused together,"I will not order this again - many of the pieces were fused together and I could not cut them apart, leaving me no option but to give them to my dog - making for a very big treat (which he loved) but a very expensive treat."
1,"Not ""All Natural""","Read the packages carefully before buying. Cadet is known for ""irradiating"" their products. That is not ""all natural."" Our holistic vet advises to never feed irradiated or ""high-pressure pasturised"" products to animals. It's not worth the risk and it definitely puts more toxic junk into their systems.Merrick is not great either. They own their own rendering plant in TX. Road kill; euthanized pets; diseased, dead, dying, and downed animals are allowed and included in rendered meats and by-products."
1,Cadet Beef Tendons Canine Treats Not as Depicted!!,"First, I waited for over two weeks to get what appeared to be a good alternative to the chicken sticks that my Shih Tzus love. Imagine my disgust when I opened the box of Cadet Natural Beef Tendons Canine Treats and found black bugs in the bag and in the packing box. In addition, the Cadet treats are not as depicted in the picture. I expected sticks, not these humongous strips, fit for a Great Dane. I immediately dumped the whole box into the trash, called Amazon, who were very apologetic and immediately refunded my purchase. Thank you, Amazon! But shame on Cadet! I am boycotting all of their products and will never buy another item from them, ever!!! The lesson for me is read the customer reviews. Had I done so, I would have avoided the whole horrible experience and I wouldn't be making chicken strips for my Shih Tzus right now.Cadet 1-Pound Bag 100-Percent Natural Beef Tendons Canine Treats"
1,RANCID,I almost fell over when I opened the bag. Product was rotten. I returned it for a full refund.
2,My dog seems to like it but . . .,"I cut it up into smaller pieces for my terrier. She really seemed to go for the treat but after about 2 weeks, I think it's what's making her vomit. She is fine on the days I don't give it to her, but the handful of times I did, sure enough, the same day or next day, she would throw up.I'm returning the product. Also, it smells pretty bad. I'll stick to piggy slivers."
3,Worse than before,Seems like this company/brand is falling apart. They used to be great but they're just okay now. These used to be thin long strips that actually looked like achilles tendons (two points of insertion at 1 end and one point of attachment on the other end) as pictured. The new one is just a giant slab thats 2-3 inches wide and doesn't interest my dog at all.
2,Eh.,"These crack loudly when she chews them. I prefer bully sticks (as does she). These aren't really worth it - they are loud, go quickly, and the pieces are unwiedly sizes. These are not a bully stick substitute."
3,"Rigid and Pointy, Take Care","These chews are quite rigid and they have some sharp points on them. We have had some bloody stool with these so I will not be buying again. Part of this may be my dog not chewing them thoroughly so if your dog chews carefully you may have a better experience. I have a beagle that's kind of a chow hound so probably the pieces get swallowed before they're truly ready to go. But I also buy bison or buffalo tendons and have never had that problem with them. They seem to be softer, more fleshy. This is also true of things like bully sticks and yak milk chews, whether they are not as sharp or they digest easier, I'm not sure but we've had no problems. I may look for another brand and see if we have a better experience with those, as the beef tendons are definitely more cost effective than the bison tendons."
2,not consistent quality,I have ordered these before and was happy with them. They were long and usually curled length wise in sort of like a stick of cinnamon. The dogs enjoyed them with nothing left behind. This time I ordered 3 packages and they were flat shapes and irregular sizes. These shredded into small sharp shard-like pieces that looked decidedly dangerous and the dogs couldn't finish them. If they had tried I think these would have caused harm. At these prices I won't risk it again.
4,My dog loves em,"I got this bag to replace the ones we were buying at $4.99 a pop at the petstore. These are smaller in size (length) than the petstore ones. Otherwise, good to go; they smell, but not more than expected. They don't make my dog sick in any way. It takes my 9 mo boxer mix about 60m to finish one."
4,tendon dog treat,"he likes these, not as much as the bull sticks. good for mixing it up a bit, and one will keep him busy for up to an hour!"
1,Not what advertised,"These are complete crap. They are not the beef tendons they used to be, or that shown in the picture on amazon. What I received is some kind of dried out, pressed flat, jerky like wafers. Also the label in the picture on amazon says ""100 percent natural"" but the label on the package I received says ""premium quality"". What I received is junk that I'm afraid to even feed my dog."
1,These are YUCK!,This product is not at all the same as the Old West Beef Tendons. I am very dissatisfied with this product! They were not chewy but very brittle with a disgusting powdery coating.
3,Really stinky,"These are really stinky. Not a problem as far as the dog is concerned; most dogs would be hard pressed to decide if they wanted to eat or roll in four day old road kill, after all. I, however, am thanking my lucky stars I have an airproof tin tub to store these treats in. The strips are also irregularly sized and shaped. Again, the dog doesn't seem to mind, but, given the smell, I would prefer not to have to poke thru the bag looking for a large piece when I want to keep the dog occupied for a while. I assume the dog would give these a five star rating; I give them only a three."
2,Whew! Stinky...,"Great price. Our dog loves them. But wow, these smell really, really bad. They don't leave any stains based on artificial coloring but we won't order these again based on the odor - worse smelling than any other variety we've tried in 13 years of dog ownership."
3,Dog seems to like them but man do they stink!,"These treats are really greasy and stinky and only suitable for outdoors. However, because of that the dog really likes them. But then again he likes licking his butt and rolling in poop too."
2,Too Big and Hard to Break!,"I need to find a new source of tendon chews for my 3 small dogs (30 lbs. and under). I purchased these a couple of times and only a few were really large. Previous tendons I've purchased have been round, evidently these are flattened and they are hard as rocks. So there's a huge piece that I can seldom break into smaller pieces, so I get little value for my money. It seems it wouldn't be that difficult for Cadet to at least break these into 1/2"" wide pieces instead of 1"" plus, then it might be possible to break a 10-12"" piece in half. My dogs are also having diarrhea this time and they never get diarrhea from tendons. I won't be ordering these again."
2,NOt as pictured,"I expected this would be/look like what was shown on the bag..the beef tendons, the slightly rounded twisty things I've always gotten before, but these were SUPER flat and easily crunched...these are not the beef tendons pictured in THIS bag used as the photograph unfortunately."
3,Large tendons,"I should have listened to the reviews on this item, it said 100 pieces, I thought that this would keep my dog occupied for days, there were only 8 LARGE pieces, they are very brittle and cannot be broken. This will keep her occupied for 8 hours, it is better than the twisted tendons at $4 a piece, but not the size or description of the item on line. She did, however, LOVE them and I will probably order again!"
1,Does not fit all LG phones,This tip does not fit my LG VX4650 phone. The seller really needs to inform which LG phones this tip fits.
1,"Horrible, Horrible movie!!","If you like to see adults get beat up then you should definatly buy this movie. That was supposed to be the funniest part of the movie I'm guessing. If a baby was supposed to be smarter than Albert Einstein I don't think they would be saying things like ""Diaper Gravy"". All in all this was the worst movie I've ever seen. You'll have to pay me at least $100 to ever see it again."
1,Horrible,"I'm sorry to those who liked it but I rented it and it was a waste of money. i fell asleep 40 minutes into it. I don't know, maybe its just boring to see babies talking like adults. I'm not bothering to see the 2nd one."
1,AWFUL!!!,"It's the worst movie for children I've ever seen!. Was it supposed to entertain the kids?. My 6 and 7-year old children kept yawning all the time... The idea behind the ""scientific project"" is scary as it is having those poor children confined in an underground lab. The family running the child care is out of this world and K.Turner overacts. What else?. Find a better way to entertain your children: read, play a board-game, draw, talk,... if you share time with them YOU'll always know what they're talking about!"
3,Kids will love the adorable babies and dumb adults.,"The theme of this movie is a universal truth. The baby actors have a special magic that is captured beautifully in this story. The lip animations are sometimes amazing. The slapstick humor borderlines on violent and the adult dialog is not enough to keep parents entertained. Director Bob Clark's great sense of humor is fantastic fun for kids, but parents will be bored if not confused by the gapping holes in the plot. Kathleen Turner plays a great Evil Witch but whats her story? Why are the characters doing what they are doing? And another thing, can someone please get Christopher Lloyd a cab out of town, I will gladly pay the fare."
1,"If Babies Could talk, they'd be Mocking this Film.","Wow, what a Stinker This turned out to be, is there Anyone on Earth who Liked this film, if there Is, I haven't Met them. When your sitting in a Movie Theatre watching a Kids movie, and the Kids around you are Rolling their eyes and Tuning Out, driving there Matchbox cars on the Arm Rests, that is a Sure-Fire Sign that the Makers of the film have Failed to Hook their Target Audience...."
5,Sly vs. Wit,Sly and Wit are the two babies. I thought the movie was great. I mean it mad you hate those adults in the movie.It was wonderfully created movie1
3,"cheesy,but cool",most of the funny parts are kiddy cheesy funny that would not be funny to older people.but there was also a couple funny parts that werent corny.i will admit there were many boring parts in this movie.i can see why other reviewers give this flick 1 star.because it was kind of corny
1,***WARNING*** May be hazardous to your health..,"Dont waste your time, just dont! This movie totally sucked. Not at all what I expected. Why anyone would want to put themselves through this torture is beyond me. I learned my lesson the hard way a few years ago when I picked this garbage up from the ""bargain bin"" at a local video store. Please..at this point I think Id pay someone to get this movie off of my hands. Thats how bad it is!"
1,AAHHH!!! (as in suprise and/or alarm),"me and my fellow cohorts thought we'd find a new way to torture ourselves via the medium of motion picture, or ""talkies"" as i perfer to call them. i started it all with ""head"" starring the monkeys, and thought it best i end the torture 3 or so weeks later, after such masterpieces as ""battlefield earth"", ""kazaam"", and ""santa with muscles"", by renting ""da hip hop witch""(check the reviews on that, and i think his grudge against me is still in effect). but the pain was far from over after we found this ""doozy"".why was this movie even made? here's all i have to say about the movie.1-Gene Siskel called it one of the worst movies of the year... and then died later that year(possibly from the movie, we can't be sure...more tests)2-maximum of 1,000 words, hrmm, i could have done it in two: Diaper Gravy."
1,"Horrible, terrible, pathetic, and for little kids!","What in the world was going on with the minds of the makers of this film? To me, it's obvious that this film was made for very young children. I felt embarrassed that I saw it in the first place. You'd think that a live-action movie of toddlers would be one of the best theatrical movies ever. How can anyone older than 8 enjoy this film? It's complete GARBAGE! The only reason I gave it one star is the fact that this is a live-action 'Rugrats', and also because you shouldn't really expect much from a film that's aimed at 5 year olds. However, they still should have aimed more toward a general audience instead of little kids only. So unless you need some entertainment for 5 year olds, I'm sure it would be anybody's best interests to leave this crap alone."
1,How I hate this stupid movie,"Babies can talk? give me a break. You see the DVD's cover? Tell you the truth, if you watch this stupid movie you will have to see this ugly-looking kid throughout the film."
2,This movie rates with teh worst MST3K films,"This is horrible trash. Baby Geniuses has got to be among the worst films I have ever seen. The ""slapstick"" comedy is unrealistic and just plain unfunny. The plot is unbelieveable and underdeveloped. It makes you think about whatever the parents who let their childern star in this movie are on. All in all, if MST3K was still on, this movie would be on its hit list in teh next few years."
3,Fun for kids,My kids enjoyed the babies in this movie and I thought they were pretty cute. I would recommend this movie for ages seven to ten.
2,Choose another movie to entertain yourself...,"The previews of this movie made it look halarious. It was anything but. Actually it was just a bunch of mumbo jumbo about nothing. I thought the kid was cute when he was trying on different outfits and dancing around...especially when he put on the white polyester suit and did his ""Saturday Night Fever"" dance. But even then, the computer generated like moves cut it down. This movie was hardly entertaining."
2,Acute but worthless movie.,This movie had it's great moments like when the parents were changing the two kids diapers that was funny. THe acting was bad. The story was bad. This movie cand make a toddler poop in his diaper and have his dad change him and wipe him . BAD
3,Babies out of Control!!!,"Kathleen Turner, star of Romancing the Stone (1986), Body Heat (1981), is the star of Baby Geniuses and plays the same character as she did in Body Heat...as a sexy seductress with her own evil lust and plans for meanness in a PG kind of way. One thing, little babies is what this movie is geared towards. Not kids, not adults, babies.Christopher Lloyd is there, and it doesn't help the pain. Basically, all babies are geniuses, and Kathleen Turner is the antagonist. I didn't buy this movie, but, afterwards, I had to, because it is soooo stupid. If you are feeling the need to laugh at something, this too, is a movie for you."
2,More of a car accident than a movie,"Both can result in Post Tramadic Stress Syndrom and both make you not want to repeat the experience. The actors are bad(and trust me I have seen many ""bad movies)the plot is invisable(there isn't one) and my time was wasted. I realize that this is a kid's movie for a specific audience but happened to making a movie enjoyable for adults? Or kids over 5 for that matterOverall-I know you are not thinking about wasting your time with this movie but just in case you've blown a circut and feel compleaded to rent do not bother."
1,pains me to give it even a one,"well to wuote another reviewer: ""This movie makes the movies on MST3K look like cinematic masterpieces"". by the way, that is the funniest thing ive heard in months. if only it were a joke. hell even i was a kid when i watched this, and MY intelligence was insulted. just look at the dvd cover. 'nuff said about the actors."
1,"The biggest piece of ""diaper gravy"" of 1999.","There is so much wrong with this movie. For one thing, the babies' mouths DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT move in sync with what they are saying. A couple of times, the adult actors' voices do not go with what they are saying, either. This was a major annoyance in the movie. It would not have been so bad if they just had the babies do their actions and have voice-overs without their lips moving (like Homeward Bound, a 5-star movie). But no, the movie is ruined. Buy and be sorry."
1,I must protest with all that I have......,"Either Johnny8Ball is at the height of his sarcastic powers or he has contributed the single worst review ever to appear on Amazon.com. Not only is the movie he selected one of the most incompetent and offensive ever made, it is perverse, dull, slapdash, and horribly unfunny. The alleged ""humor"" never hits (NOT ONCE!) and the performances by the ""legendary cast"" range from embarrassing to downright shameful. Hopefully, potential viewers will avoid the obviously jaded rambling of Mr. Eight Ball and stay far, far away from a film that would not appeal to anyone, adults or children."
1,Trash,"This movie is horrible, I mean for a comedy it isn't even funny. They aren't even babies there toddlers, I mean come on folks, my two younger brothers didn't even like this movie. How can people even compare this to the Rugrats. If you want a movie to entertain your kids or yourself rent any other movie than this. I highly recommend not wasting your money on even renting it."
5,great suite,This suite is very warm and comfy the only problem I had after my purchase was I seem it for about $10.00 less than what I paid for it
3,This Scoot-About has one big flaw,I bought this Scoot About for my grandaughter who is 2. The major problem with this toy is that the back wheel are too close together and she runs over her own feet when scooting around. I do like the fact that she is learning to turn the handlebars the direction that she wants to go. I just wish I had bought one with the back wheel farther apart.
5,Great way to learn,"We got this for our Grandson when he was about 16 months, as a Christmas gift. He knew what it was for right off. He threw his leg over it and took off, although he was standing up. Now, he will be 2 in a couple of months and he goes everywhere on it. It's good an sturdy and well built too. Even my 10 yr old Grandson rides it to the toy room when it's time to put up the toys."
4,Radio Flyer Scoot-About,"This toy is great for toddlers that are not ready for peddles yet. I would have given it 5 stars if it would have A lower seat adjustment it does adjust but my grandson is A little short for his age (17 months) but he still plays on it he straddles it and walks around with it and loves to be pushed when u get him to sit on the seat and put his feet up on the front.I'm sure as soon as he grows a little more he will enjoy it even more.We also have the little wagon and he loves pulling it around and hauling blocks,toys,and etc.We can't wait till he can peddle, Radio Flyer has so many nice ride on toys.I grew up with their toys also."
2,Made cheaply.,The screw that holds the handle bar did not fit since the holes where not aligned. I had to use a drill to make a larger hole. I was expected better product from this brand.
3,"Good, but a few quality issues","I share the views of a couple of other viewers that the quality control could be a bit better. I am handy with tools and it took me about 30 minutes to put together, with the aid of my wife holding a couple of parts. The screws that go on the underside are cheap and would be easily stripped if you tried to tighten them too much. The hole that holds the bolt in the steering fork was off a hair -- that took a good 5-7 minutes for something that should take 30 seconds. The plastic seems of pretty good quality. The steering is a bit tight, and should be easier for a toddler. These are fit and finish issues -- Radio Flyer, a good Illinois company, needs to talk to their fabricator in China about these issues."
3,Generally Pleased,"Bought 3 of these for our 3 two year old grandchildren. They seem to like them very much, though one of the 3 had some quality control issues (handle bar on one was difficult to turn)."
5,Radio Flyer Scooter,"We bought the Radio Flyer Scooter for our one year old for her birthday. She was riding it before we could wrap it. This was perfect, because she was then able to show off the scooter at her party. By the third day, she was ringing the bell all by herself. The steering is a little difficult for her right now, but in a couple of months, we predict this to be her favorite toy."
3,Nice scooter but will be outgrown quickly,"I purchased this scoot-about for my son when he was 18 months old. However, it took him about three months to get into using it. At first, he was hitting his heels on the back wheels, but now he zooms around all over the place on it and has a fabulous time! I like it because it is small enough that he can use it in the house without causing too much damage. The seat height is adjustable, which is a great feature. Besides taking him a while to figure out, I don't think he will use it for much longer as we are getting him a larger back for his birthday in a couple of months. Over all, I think it is a well made product, but he will outgrow it before he got much use out of it."
5,Radio Flyer Scooter Bike,"My year old granddaughter hopped right on, put her ""cell phone"" in the basket, and off she went. Her older brother had the same scooter when he was little and he also loved it."
4,Fun first trike,"This is such a cute little tricycle. My 2yr old seems to enjoy it. I like that it has an adjustable seat, and it was pretty easy to put together. He has short legs, so he should be able to use it for awhile. If your child has long legs, his/her heels may hit the back wheels while scooting around."
2,heels keep hitting the rear wheels,"My son has been using this for close to 5 months now and he's had the same problem from day 1 - his heels keep hitting the rear wheels. I didn't really mind so much when he was just starting to walk but now that he's running around, he has learned to take baby steps while using it so his heels won't hit the rear wheels."
4,Overall: a hit,"I bought this for my godson's 1st birthday. His dad mentioned that it did require 4 tools to put together and from context clues I gathered that it wasn't very easy for him to assemble. But now that it's together the little guy really likes it and enjoys the mobility it offers. I found the steering to be a bit stiff, which together with the 1 year old not having a strong concept about how to steer, led to him running into walls fairly often but I'm optimistic that the steering will loosen up with use and the user will figure out how to turn corners soon. Overall, it was a hit."
3,Just too small,"We bought this bike for our 2 1/2 year old son 5 months ago so he could learn steering without worrying about pedals. I ignored the comments people made about the bike being small because my son is very short for his age (only 32"" tall). Nevertheless, by the time he figured out how to steer, he was too big for it and his feet constantly trip on the wheels. I'm disappointed with how fast he outgrew it."
3,scoot-about trike,"The bike has tipped over forward several times (handlebars to the ground) as my 2 year old nephew has ridden it. And, as other reviewers have mentioned, his heels tend to hit the back wheels. He's even on the short side for his age. (I've tried the seat at the different settings.) I think I'm going to look into the classic tricycle."
2,Did they test this?,"I agree with some other reviewers that this bike is poorly designed. Our daughter has the same problem of her feet hitting the back wheels when she tries to scoot. Some of the features are nice, like the adjustable height of the seat, the easy turning of the wheels using the handlebar, and she loves to ring the bell, but it is too frustrating for her to ride on this toy because her range of motion is limited by the wheels. She ends up trying to compensate by making the bike scoot backward. Not how it was intended to be used. It's a good looking bike, but the function is very poorly designed."
5,"My baby is so happy with this flyer scoot,","I received the flyer scooter in excellent condition, """"""my baby believes tha he is the best driver in the word"""""", he enjoys it so much...."
1,Too small,I bought this for my grandaughter's second birthday. It was too small for her and she isn't very large for her age. The quality was good and she liked the bell but was not able to ride it without her knees bumping into the handlebars.
1,Warning - POS,"This kids scootter/bike is a major pos. Cheap welds, even cheaper screw on parts, steering is bad, offset welds. Do not buy this."
4,"Fun, but cannot grasp how to work it","I assembled this for our son and found it to be moderate - not super easy but not too hard. I am disappointed that everytime this comes out, my son is still trying to determine what to do with his feet. And I can never quite be sure where to put the seat. He got it for his 1 yr. birthday and now he is 19m. He is far from dumb, but this toy is just not sinking in! But he enjoys walking it, ringing the bell, and vrooming!"
1,"super saving shipping not honored, could not cancel within minutes","this item was ordered with ""free with super saver shipping."" however, we were still charged shipping and within minutes of the confirmation email, this order ""could not be changed."" no apparent way to get in contact with anyone and ammend the order. very displeased with this service!"
5,Great learning material,"I've tried to find informative materials on satire as a form and genre, but it was so hard to find. This text was fantastic and exactly what I was looking for!"
4,Almost 5 stars,This is a very good movie. IF you like old school Kung Fu movies this is one of the best. The final fight seen draged out a little for me but all and all it was a good movie.
3,Good but Overhyped,"This is a must have for any serious Kung fu fan. Good fights ( lots a different styles) some comedy..and this is actually one of the better dvd transfers of old kung fu flicks I have seen. The final fight scene was a bit dissapointing, and I think the movie is a bit overhyped. That being said, its still a classic."
4,Still dont know who the bad guy is,"One of the best martial arts movies of all time. The intro scene is enough to capture any fan. The background music is hilarious, and all of the fighters have some goofy yet extreme super power. Highly entertaining."
2,Defective master?,"I was thrilled to see this classic released on DVD, however I've received two copies and both are defective. About 28 minutes in the picture freezes. My first copy disabled my DVD player completely; it wouldn't recognize any command except Power Off. The replacement copy shows very pixilated picture/frames then picks up the action in full again at about minute 36.There's a big disclaimer before the film begins that the original 35mm film is damaged so the picture quality of the DVD is compromised. Does this mean all copies have defects? Are others experiencing this same issue?"
1,"Cheasy, very cheasy","I am a big fan of the classic kung fu movies. However, I found this movie to be extremely cheasy. The One-Armed Boxer, the hero, is from a prior film. This movie fails to offer enough background about the hero, so I found myself rooting for the enemy instead. Additionally, the One-Armed Boxer's missing arm is clearly noticeable tucked within his shirt. It is hard to take him and his fighting scenes serious. Where this film lacks in plot, it makes up for in a multitude of characters and creative fight scenes. You will see where many video games got inspiration for characters and fighting techniques. Instead of this film, I suggest a film with Bruce Lee, the Venom Mob, Gordon Liu, Jackie Chan or the ""Five Fingers of Death""."
1,GREAT MOVIE!...but...,"I am writing neither to critique the movie nor to eplore the quality of the video or audio. I would simply like to warn potential buyers of the manufacturer defects that I have enconter with TWO copies of this DVD.The first copy was scratched so severly it looked like a fat guy attempted to use it to ski down slopes of rough pavement. So Amazon promptly shipped out another. The second copy didn't have a scratch but the movie hung up in the EXACT same place as the first. ANNOYING! I am currently waiting on another copy, but if it's bad I'm giving up.*IMPORTANT* Consumers, take my review very seriously because I suspect these other reviewers have no experience with the DVD, they're just fans of the film. And what an awesome film it is."
2,Does quality matter???,"I bought this movie yesterday and it really is a classic! But the quality seems to go to hell throught certain scenes, flickering colors. It even stopped playing about 30 min. in. I don't know what's up but I really feel ripped off. Maybe the double disc version will be better. Highly doubtfull concidering this version was supposedly remastered?"
3,Great Movie... Defective Disc,"This review is referring specifically to the new 2-Disc Anniversary Edition of MotFG. Needless to say, this movie is a kung fu classic and this remaster looks and sounds excellent (as good as it can get). The first disc includes the original Mandarin version, while disc 2 includes the dubbed version. However, on Disc 2 (the English dubbed disc) there is a glitch which keeps chapter 10 from playing (roughly 32 minutes into the movie). I don't know how widespread this problem may be (or not), but keep this in mind."
4,"Classic movie, very good DVD with some problems","This Ultimate Edition stuff just should not be used as a term for DVDs unless there really is no more room for improvement. That said, this is a great effort in restoration of a classic movie. The movie itself is a must see for martial arts fans. Special features are very well done. However, the picture still could have been cleaned up more. And the flickering of the image as well as color issues were also places where improvement had room. But overall well worth buying even if it's not exactly Ultimate."
5,"Tanka Tanka Skunk, Awesome!!!",A skunk named Skunk and an elephant named Tanka love rhythm and rhyme. Skunk and Tanka like to meet different animals like alligator and polar bear. They always make a rhythm with the animals' names by dividing the syllables into beats. Skunk and Tanka also make rhymes out of the animal names. The book is an amazing way to teach syllables. Webb uses rhyme as well as rhythm to emphasize the syllables in the names of animals most children know. The illustrations only add to the magic. The animals are cartoon structure with vibrant colors that catch the audience's eyes. It brings excitement and learning together as one. The classroom becomes full of educated musicians.
4,Animals and rhythm,"I borrowed this book from the library for my 4 year old son to look at, and it was a success! He can read individual words, but sentences and paragraphs tend to overwhelm him. The animal names (with accompanying illustrations) in large print and arranged in a catchy rhythm had him reading the book to himself. Not great literature, but a fun read."
5,Great Beat,I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old who love this book. They go around the house citing phrases out of this book. The 3 year old has it memorized. The beat keeps them really engaged. We have read this book over and over again it is a bedtime favorite.
5,Chilling,This book was a chilling book on the life of Ivan Milat. I couldn't put it down. It gave me chill's & made me feel quiet emotional at times. A must read.
3,Sins of the Brother,Had to return for a refund. Was unable to get the full enjoyment out of product due to incomplete download.
1,Don't waste your time or money on this one.,"This book was very disappointing. Whilst it did give an overall feeling of Milat's background and the kind of person he is, the books is written in the language of the socioeconomic class of the people involved (bottom of the ladder), which after a few chapters is very irritating.The lack of forensic detail you would expect in this genre is sorely missing, and my overall feeling was that I would have been much better informed by simply reading the newspapers at the time.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,pretty painful,"There's one dance number in here that looks like it was choreographed by Salvador Dali on a $10 budget... and I can watch it over and over... but the rest of the movie is terrible. Maybe it's poor subtitling, but the jokes are thin and the plot is dull. I have a huge affinity for Bollywood and I admit my standards are pretty forgiving, but this one is really weak.It's such a shame because that one dance scene is so awesome."
3,Looks good . . . but?,"I bought the shuffle first and wrestled with the software installation . . . it finally worked great, but I decided to get something that offered more unlimited space. SO - The Nano - This little cutie comes with everything EXCEPT a manual. It has a quick start guide, but NO detailed info whatsoever. I'm hoping that the software won't give me the same problem as the shuffle did. I'm charging the Nano right now as I have no information on how to tell when or if it's out of battery power! My software for the shuffle, was as others have said, void of any options. It just assumed I wanted the songs installed in a random manner. I DIDN'T. So, I ended up uninstalling everything and over riding an error message to install everything in the way I WANTED it. By the way the three stars is just for the appearance in wishful thinking that this install will be better than the shuffle. I'll review it again after I've gone through the set up process."
5,Idiots,"Please explain to me how you people could be stupid enough to judge a electronic device's worth on a drop test. Do you purposely drop it on the ground, or are you so stupid to let it drop? I mean, come on. No wonder you have trouble returning them to the store."
1,overpriced,The price keeps getting lower on Amazon & customer service does not respond to my inquiries. There are different prices throughout the day which is ridiculous.
5,Outstanding Product,"I have had the nano for about four months. It is one of the best buys that I have ever made. I run six days a week in all weather, always with my nano. Battery life is great: I get at least 8 hours on it. As for delicacy, I bought the sleave to help protect the nano (based on other reviews), and I have not had any scratches are mechanical issues. My only problem at all is that there are some downloads that are not compatible with the iPod!"
1,How Long to Charge???/,"Ok, the 2 girls wanted one each. Looks simple, 1st page plug and and follow the directions. Well page 5 tells you how to change it, I have it plug in and charging going on 3 1/2 hours and still on the opening screen, do not disconnect."
1,BUYERS BEWARE,"I guess the sales people forget to tell you certain things about the IPod, so I am saying this now:THE BATTERIES ARE NON-REPLACABLE.Sure, you can buy into a battery extension program for a maximum of one extra year with IPod AUD$99.00...But I don't think I will waste my money on it. I'll buy the Creative Neeon with replacable battery or the new Sony NWA1000."
1,Buyer beware: Don't buy this product without extended warranty,"The 40GB click wheel iPod I bought for my husband for Christmas last year died (hard drive fried) 360 days after he opened the box but one year and 3 weeks past when I bought it. Appeals to an Apple Store and the ""Apple Cares"" (how's that for an oxymoron?) phone line fell on deaf ears. They were unwilling to make any exception or provide discounts on a replacement, ""...our warranty clearly states...from the date of purchase..."". So, in all caps, if you must buy an iPod, BUYER BEWARE! Think of this as a disposable purchase that will only last as long as the warranty."
4,best ipod yet !!!!!!,"Let me start off by saying that the only reason i gave this 4 stars is that ist does not include necessary things like a wall charger adapter. I have been through all the ipods that apple has released, and let me tell you, this is the best one. It is slim and stylish, and with 4 gigs of space a real stunner being so small. Sound quality is great since it has a flash drive and it doesn't skip around either. Don't forget that it also includes a nice velvety free case. And don't listen to all those people saying it breaks to easily...i have had mine for a while, and as long as you don't rough around with it it probably won't break. However it dos scrach easily so i suggest keeping on the plasticy cover that comes with it because it works just fine and at the same time protects the ipod. If you are looking to buy an ipod for he first time or are just upgrading get this one!!!!"
2,scratches!!!,Love this little guy but I can hardly read the screen after 5 days of delicate use because it is so scratched up. I'm extremely upset that my 249.00 piece of electronic fun is going to need plastic surgery soon to be able to use it.
2,All hype and no substance.,"Pros:+ Impressive design. Simple and very elegant.+ Good support and integration from 3rd party.Cons:- Poor battery life. The UP TO 14 hours is realisticly 8 hours for new batteries. (Lets hope the battery last for a least a year)- Locked to iTunes. No every machine has iTunes installed.- One-way sync means no backing up your music.- Easily scratches.- Overpriced accessories.- No radio.- No recording.- Restrictive file format support.- OPTIONAL charger!!! For the price, who are we kidding.IMO, the Nano is not worth its value. Apple should be very proud of the campaigning job they've done with the Ipod."
1,Buyer Beware!!!!!!,"This is a great sounding player with a lot of features that I really like. Unfortunately, I rarily get to enjoy them because the unit has so many problems. Pray you never get the exclamation folder. If you don't know what I'm talking about, consider yourself lucky. After multiple calls to the help center, downloading the latest updater software (two updates so far) that the help center said would fix my problem and all the bugs these units have, and searching the support site for advice from others that may have had this problem, I've given up and am sending it back to Apple. If you get the Nano, make sure you also get the Apple extended warranty."
1,It died after one month and all the replacements BREAK,"My first ipod broke after a month, it died, it did nothing. I called apple, mailed it back and received a replacement. The SECOND replacement, did not work properly, I sent it back. I received replacement number 3, its dead, it does nothing. I have called customer service numerous times, and they have tried to reset it, I switched cables, I have tried everything they have suggested to me, its still dead. The customer service I have received is appalling, I have been 'disconnected' a number of times. I wish I could return the whole thing and get my money back!!! DONT DO ITI would also like to add I purchased the ipod in February, I expect to be given a new one this month (June) so every month I get a new IPOD that ultimately breaks, its infuriating and ridiculous. I HATE IT I spend more time trying to get them fixed then I actually get to listen to it"
5,Word....,"If you are going to buy a fine German car and want to fit only two people into it, you buy a Porsche, not a VW. And if you want to do the same and put 4 into it you get something like a BMW, not a VW...So if you want to load 1000+ of your favorite songs into an MP3 player and rock out, you get an IPOD.Part of the Keep It Simple Stupid concept of life."
3,It is so light.,"It is so light but the earphone quality has some room to improve. The battery doesn't last as long as fourteen hours in the specs. In General, I am satisfied with this product."
1,Bring back the mini!,"This is a delicate product. It's all scratched up after only a week of use. They may be superficial, but lets face it, we're paying a big premium because this thing LOOKS GOOD. It should look good for more than a freaking week! Also the battery seems to take forever to charge, which is surprising. I hear that the new Sony mini players are a better bet.Update: Filled up after 811 songs. So much for holding 1000."
1,CRUDDY PLASTIC,after buying 2 of these for family members it turns out they suck! they scratch SO easy it not even funny. i gave them as gifts to some family members who were very excited but after opening them and passing them to 2 other friends sitting with us they were scratched how the heck can a brand new item get scratched in 2 min without leaving the hand?!? come on apple get off you bottom and fix this prob or i will NOT buy your products this coming holiday season for the rest of my family (which is kinda large and they all want nanos). untill apple sorts out this issue my review is 1 star but i really wish it was like -5 stars because thay how much it sucks. fix the scratches!hb.
5,The best MP3 Player on the market,"It scratches, it's expensive for the storage size, not good on durability, it is made by apple, the iTunes store is horrible. Now we have all the negatives lets look at the nano. Scratches well anything with a screen will scratch so get a protector for it, try invisible sheild works and adds no bulk to the player. Expensive for the amount of storage, it weighs an once and is as thin as a pencil, you are not paying for the storage you are paying for the small size. Durability, it has no moving parts, next complaint... it is made by Apple, yeah and your point is... Itunes is horrible? Ok it is the largest store around and it was the 50th to the market so how can it be that bad the songs are less than $1.00. this thing is great and iPOD's have the best add ons in the business. You will not find a better player period...."
4,"Amizing, but soo weak and vulnerable","I loved this ipod soooo0o0o much. it was amazing in every possible way. that was until i went to whipe the fingerprints off with my shirt. MY SHIRT SCRATCHED HTE SURFACE!! The finish on this ipod is so soft that clothing will scratch it. and then i jsut thought, ""screw it, it'll jsut be scratched up"" but then after jstu a normal day at school ,being very cautious with it, the screen cracked. i have no i dea how. the screen is sooo0o0o weak.In conclusion, this is an amazing product, so by all means buy it. But pleeasseeeee buy a very strong case for it. and keep the p[lastic film 0o0n the surface when it comes!"
2,Waste of money,"1st the ipod is expensive. It should at least come with a protective cover. 2nd i rarely used it and only when im in the gym. Quite to often when i go to turn the ipod on it goes into something called ""disk mode"" which freezes the unit up and cant be played. Theres not hard reset button so i have to go without listening to music for the hour or so im in the gym then take it home plug it in the cpu to get it to unfreeze. Im so pissed at this thing because im all exicted to finnaly listen to some music and get amped in the gym and the dang thing freezes. For the money i spent on this thing it shouldnt happen"
5,iPods R GR8,This is a great product at a great price. I'm a first time buyer of an ipod and it worth every penny I've paid.
3,It broke in a month,"I love the nano for how portable it is and how good the quality of the sound is wonderful. However, it died within a month. It is extremely fragile... scratches easily... and so you have to be very careful with it. Which kind of stinks because if its portable but you have to care for it like a newborn... then it takes away from its practical usefulness."
2,Can't play Pink Floyd's Dark Side of The Moon,".. or any album, (e.g. many Dance, Classical or Progressive Rock picks) where the tracks run together seemlessly. In other words, NO GAPLESS PLAYBACK. Instead you get a split second of silence interrupting tracks that should run together without any disturbance.Completely unforgivable for a 5th generation product from the Market Leader!Bad Apple!GaryP.S. The MP3 format has a flaw which means some silence is always present at the end of a song. But the popular LAME encoding method for MP3s embeds a value containing the proper length of the track into the file so that the decoder can tell when the file should be cut and the next mp3 in sequence should start playing. The Rio Karma (20GB), and some PC-side players have this feature. Even ""Aeroplayer"" for the Palm PDA has this feature."
4,Cool for what it is,"I love my ipod, got this one cause it was easier to bring to the gym with me, the only thing is 350 songs actually fill it up pretty past, I can't imagine how it would hold 1000 songs, but thats ok, it's cool, the black one(which I have) does scratch easy, but besides that,I've been pretty happy with this little thing."
3,"battery life sucks, some minor flaws, but great overall","This is a great bugger but it has some flaws.-Battery life stinks. Yes I fiddle with the backlight once in a while, but I am still getting about 7 hours out of this. thats half the facotry specs-some software flaws. I have to 'reset' it often becuase it randomly decides it no longer wants to fast forward-cant unplug sync cable with headphones still plugged in-otherwise these are minor, except for (1) - I love this thing"
4,Great little gem...,The iPod Nano is a miniature version of the discontinued iPod Mini + iPod Photo. It plays like a regular iPod in a compact little package. The only thing I didn't like was that the screen got scratched up when I put it in my pocket the first week. The screen is VERY fragile.
3,4gb nano,"it sounds and looks great, but now after buying it, new versions came out that were cheaper and have more GBs, i wish i would of waited, also the last time i went to charge it on my computer it told me there was an update, it totally messed things up and said there was an error and i had to restore it back to original settings and reload all my music, then i hear hear all kinds of stories about how the battery life is short and it will give me trouble later, so i'm kinda leary about how long it will last before it breaks"
3,Warning - this is the old version,"Please note that this is the old version (""Generation 1"") iPod nano, not the new (""Generation 2"") version. The new version has much better battery life and a brighter screen, but if you want it in black you have to pay the extra for the 8GB (4GB is not available in black in Gen 2 at the time of writing)."
3,Itchy and Scratchy,"When I am walking to work, listening to music on my iPod, all is well. But to adjust it, I must get it out of the protective cocoon I have devised. Just like so many other folks, I proudly handed my new iPod to friends and family the first day I got it. Then I looked at it -- Ugh! It looked like I dragged it along a sidewalk for a mile by the headphones. I went to Decalgirl and got some skins to cover it -- but too late. It is not ruined but....How does Black Nano work? Well, the synching with iTunes, etc., works fine. And the sound is OK but I agree with others that anyone interested should look seriously at the Mini. The Mini is tough, has loads of accessories (including cases!), and works well.And finally -- when is Apple going to ship a complete product? For $250, the Nano should come with decent headphones, a travel/home charging kit, and, most of all, a protective case. If Apple had any sense they'd throw in $10 worth of iTunes songs as an intro to that service."
1,Wasted My Money,"I am so sorry I wasted my money on this iPod. It's unreliable and doesn't work most of the time. The battery runs down fast; iTunes frequently won't recognize it and I've had to reset a dozen times. Oh yeah, it went back to the factory once. They said it's fine. I wish I could get my money back."
1,Dont Buy The Ipod Nano,Dont buy it i bought one when it first came out and within the week i got it the screen cracked. The nano is so delicate that it can break in the palm of your hand. And the warranty does not cover it so apple told me to pay $250.00 to repair it. And thats the same price i bought the ipod nano for.
2,Don't Even Think About It!!,"On Feburary 10 2007, I will have had my Ipod Nano for approximately one whole year. Not once have I ever dropped this thing (I bought the protective case the same day) and I have never experienced any real problems out of this product. My one and only complaint is the lack of battery life. Why after 10 and a half months am I only getting about 2 hours of battery life out of this thing?? I refuse to send it in for a battery replacement so that the same thing can occur once again next year. I think that I will just purchase the Zune which has so much more to offer than the Ipod and I will advise all others to do the same. Besides, Microsoft rules over Apple anyways!!"
1,Product is useless,"I bought a iPod Nano two months ago, and it suddenly stopped working. However, unlike my other portable electronics and cell phones that I have dropped numerous times over multiple years, m iPod had never even been dropped. However, when I took it to the Apple store, they said that they refused to do anything about it but told me that I could get 10% off a replacement product. I strongly recommend avoiding this product."
4,Protect Your iPod,I got the Nano and ordered an acrylic cover for it from agent18.com. This is the best cover I have seen. It completely protects the nano - especially the screen. Check it out.
1,Don't jog with this!,"I got the black one and got a few scratches on it. I jog every weekend for about 25 minutes each morning. Condensation got under the screen and it's not covered in my warranty. It still works but for this price, unexcusable."
5,The Greatest...as usual,"First I had the mini..now I have the nano. So lightweight I don't even ""feel it"" when I a wearing it during workouts. Sound quality..top notch. Caveat: Don't order Apple's ""Grey"" Sports Armband. It is really white..it is overpriced..and it DOES NOT hold up well under workout conditons."
5,"Ok, I thought ""what's with the hype?""","Man, this thing is the bomb! Easy to use, although I'm doing so unconventionally, great for the gym. Because of the reviews I read, I bought the Belkin silicone sleeve to protect it from scratches which also came with a ""screen saver"", so to speak, and an arm band. Software is cake compared to the Samsung yepp that made quite the sound as it hit the bottom of my trash can!! (that's the best sound it ever made!) I'm sorry I waited to long to cross over to the dark side!!"
4,great!,"I am loving my ipod nano. It is so small and light and the sound is great! I have just one suggestion : get another earbuds, because the ones that come inside the box are not so good!"
1,"Great idea, flawed product","It's hard not to like a ipod that is so small with such a nice screen, however, the face of the unit scratches so easily (after 1 week of gentle service) that I can't imagine I will be able to see anything clearly on it in a few months. Apple needs to rethink the design or ship it with some sort of protective case."
5,Project RED,"This is a nifty little device. The only advice I would give about it is to go to Apple's website to order it, because you now have the option on their site to get a Project RED iPod.A number of companies are participating in Project RED by donating a percentage of their profits towards the purchase of anti-retroviral drugs to help fight AIDS in Africa. The Project RED iPod is also bright red, which also stirs awareness for the cause, as I believe red iPods are otherwise unheard of.So, yeah. Get an iPod, listen to your tunes, download my band when our album comes out. And, while you're at it, do something good for other people (apart from Apple's shareholders, who I'm sure are doing just fine). Support the cause."
2,Huge flaw... Nano scratches more easily than it should...,This is gorgeous and beautiful piece of art to look at but there's a major flaw: it scratches too easily. It scratches easily when in a pocket with nothing else and eventually makes the screen unreadable in short time. Look up discussions at the Apple support website or ipodlounge.I recommend waiting until the second generation on this one.All the best.
4,Great !!,"This nano is one of the smallest players on the market today. Despite the small form factor, at 4GB the iPod nano holds more than any other flash player out there, and comes in a package nearly a third the size of other MP3 players with the same storage capacity.Pros: Slim; intuitive; under-rated 15-hour battery; vivid color LCD; rich sound; games; now works with Outlook; skip-free; fast write times; no need for partitioning to use as USB Mass Storage Device.Cons: Non-replaceable battery; no FM/voice/line-in recorder; doesn't replace 6GB iPod mini's storage capacity.Verdict: Slim, stylish, and fully loaded, the iPod nano is a great deal for a flash-based MP3 player."
2,low battery,The first generation ipod nano I bought can only play for about 5 hours before the battery is dead. My old ipod nano could last for 15 hours. I thought refurbished meant more than just Polishing the brass.
2,Worst MP3 player out there,"Pros: Good-LookingCon: The entire IPodI have never owned an ipod, and i still know just by the specs that they are horrible. You can only use files that you have paid for and downloaded from itunes. Period. This would still be ridiculus even if Itunes was a decent program. People give good reviews for these ipods simply because they havent tried anything else, because the ipod is so popular. Every part of the ipod is terrible and i would reccomend any 20 dollar MP3 player over it. I doubt you'll listen to me as there are so many other good reviews out here, and youll probably be very pleased with it until you see another non-Apple MP3 player in action."
1,iPods? Please...I'll stick with Creative Nomads...,"4 GB. That is it. 4. Any serious music listener knows that 4 GB is hideous! If you want an mp3 player, get a creative nomad! Those are even better than iPods! GASP! '_' <Whoa!) Who cares about what Eminem uses or what the trend is? Nanos still stink! Why do people think that iPods are so great, anyway? If someone can explain to me why, I will stop making fun of them. For now, I still am convinced that iPods are a waste of money. This 4 GB iPod is more expensive than a 40 GB Creative Nomad Zen Xtra Jukebox. If you don't believe me, go ahead and compare the prices!"
3,Beautiful with great sound but lacking key features,"I just received the Nano as a graduation gift and the size, the beauty, and the sound of it really did impress me. However, my previous MP3 player was a Creative Muvo and I miss many of the features on that player such as radio, voice recorder, and a much longer battery life. If you're looking for an mp3 player for around the same price I recommend the the Sandisk Sansa e260 or e70. It sounds just as good as the ipod nano, is almost as small, and includes all of the features above including a larger screen."
3,not user friendly,"after receiving my ipod i connected it to my laptop and it says dont disconnect. after a while i removed the ipod and try to switch on, it displays a folder icon and an apple website link. i installed itunes and still the same problem. after around few hours i found that the software on my ipod is old version and need to upgrade. after upgrade it worked fine.pros:Good design, sleekclick wheelphotos looks goodcons:- can be controlled only through itunes, difficult to navigate/transfer files without itunes (this is not good, u should have itunes installed on u r PC). it changes file names.- finger prints prone, need to clean every time u touch it- dosent comes with charging, sample files- user manual is not in detail. no information on initial charging etc"
3,come on!!!,"I purchased an iPod Nano 2 weeks ago. When I brought it home, I had forgotten something. A case to protect it. I had to call the Apple store to ask if they made a case and they said, ""No we don't. We are coming in soon."" Why is it taking so long for Apple to create a case? My iPod isn't scratched yet because I left the wrapping on it. If you buy a product that is so fragile and scratchable, wouldn't you want to buy a case? Come on Apple, make a case already. P.S. Keep the wrapping on your iPod, so it won't get scratches. Take the wrapping off when you buy a case."
1,Buggy Windows Software and Horrible Support,"This is truly my first bad experience with an apple product. Out of the box this puppy works great- however as soon as the ipod software updates the software on the unit- its dead in the water. Windows can't find it- and itunes won't run it. This happens with the june 28, 2006 update- and it happened on TWO different ipod nanos (returned the first one thinking it might have been defective) and it happened on TWO different computers. Support from Apple was non existant, and a tech support actually hung up on me because they were closing. Until Apple sorts out the bugs- avoid this device. A truly disappointing experience. Shame on you apple!"
5,Ipod Nano,"I got the ipod nano for christmas and loved it!Because it is black smudges show easily. So I reccomend a leather flip case or folio case. But any should work. (The cheap tube like ones dont do much though.) Any way it holds lots of songs and pretty much never skips during a song.(hint if you want good songs try Limewire.com!) But I have a problem with the little earphone covers falling off! It has neat features like games, music quizes, photos and a stopwatch. The ipod nano has a screenlock where you pick a code and it locks it when u press the sreenlock button.So u can unlock it with your code!I thinks my nano is great and love it!"
5,My new toy,"I was the dvd junkie until my sister and I went on a trip and she introduced me to the world of IPOD. She has the IPOD mini, but I purchased the nano because I wanted soemthing that would go everywhere with me with ease. It is so small and compact that it fits into ANYTHING! The sound is awesome and this thing in perfect for those music lovers who want user friendly devices. I am certainly getting my money's worth!"
1,Spontaneous Combustion,"Do NOT get the old Ipods. I got a first generation Ipod Nano several years ago for Christmas. It's done well until lately when the battery life started getting weaker. Today I found out just how weak. I was covering the front desk at work when I left the Ipod on my own desk charging. My co-worker runs up to me minutes later and says, ""Something just exploded on your desk!"" When I came and looked, I found the battery had exploded, melted the Ipod, and was emitting some very foul-smelling smoke. My co-worker said the thing hissed and flames shot out everywhere before fizzling out. Thank goodness I wasn't sitting there at the time. After doing some internet research, I discovered this is not an uncommon occurrence in Ipods and some Iphones, especially with some of the older models, and people have been burned and property damaged as a result. Be careful. Let's hope the newest and latest is also safest..."
4,"New customer, bought used item.",Puchased used and refurbished product and so far am pleased with it. The price was cheaper than buying a new product.
2,...,"So this a good ipod, but mine doesn't hold a charge very well. I listen to it for like 20 minutes and then it goes dead!"
3,free ipod nano,it turns out the 1st gen had a battery problem where it would overheat so apple started a replacment program where you can trade in a 1st gen and get the new one free to do this copy and paste the following URL address into ur browser:[...]i hope this has been helpfull for all ipod nano 1st gen owners
3,"Nice toy, but too fragile!","I received this iPod as a gift, and it worked great for all of five days. That was before the LCD screen became cracked when my purse thumped against another shopper at the mall while the iPod was in my purse. I was shocked that the iPod broke so easily, considering the impact of the thump wasn't any greater than what usually happens when people jostle against each other in busy crowds. The iPod was well secured in its protective sleeve in a zippered pouch, too. The iPod still works, but I can't read the screen at all, which pretty much renders the gadget useless because I can't read it to program it. Well, it was nice while it lasted, but I think when I go to replace my iPod, I'll go with a heftier version."
5,"So it scratches, all of them do",Alight this is it. IM tired of u people complaining about how the ipod nao scracthes or the screen cracks when u drop it. WELL DUH!!! of course its gonna scratch its not like u can drop a cd player and nothing happens or a ds or a psp! SO STOP WHINING. all in all this is a very good product and i would reccomend that u buy it
1,Amazon Service,Do NOT order this product with the expectation of getting it by Christmas and apply for their credit card for the $30. savings!!You will be told the product will not arrive until after Christmas (actually after Jan. 2006 and we ordered on 11-26-05) and they will have all your credit information. Very misleading site.
2,Bill from Atlanta,"BUYERS BEWARE: This isn't an easy product to learn. It isn't intuitive and the instructions are awful. Additionally, I ordered it on February 16 and the ""ships in 24 hours"" didn't ship until February 21. Maybe the hours are longer at Amazon. Finally, DON'T BUY THE FM TRANSMITTER FOR $5.95. You'll be charged $6.95 in shipping and handling by the supplier, MyGearStore, and don't buy the 49 cent car charger or the 99 cent travel charger, for which the supplier Blue Proton will charge a whopping $15.98 in S/H. Save your $22 in S/H and go to Circuit City. As any marketing 101 student knows, the purchase IS the product. This one failed miserably on all counts. I was being charitable to give two stars."
3,where is the volume for my hard rock?,"ok, i am a bit disappointed with the scratches, considering i have even made sure there is absolutely nothing else in the pocket than the black nano. but is it only my hearing or is the sound very low? even when its turned as loud as possible its still very low. and i am aware of the ""soundcheck"" feature. but is it possible that it turns all the songs at a similar low level as the one it used to measure to begin with? On the plane to Riga last week it was impossible to hear music through the noise of the engine. and thet surely never happened with my sony discman. or is the american apple so scared of being sued for messing up peoples hearing that they are acting as ""parents"" and put the max volume at a safe level."
3,Why the Nano?,Why get an iPod 4gb Nano for $240+ when you can purchase an iPod 30gb video for just $50 more?... I know its small but c'mon where it's commen sense! To me the iPod Nano is like a waist of money to me! Just go with the iPod video and enjoy the nice video playback feature and also enjoy the 30gb's!
5,OMG OMG OMG ITS SO AWESOME!,OMG OMG OMG! this ipod nano is so sexy! its the sexiest ipod outthere you know!!! omg omg omg im looking at it right now and its so awesome! i am 11 years old and its sooooo cool! mine has not 1 scrathc on it and i keepe it in my pocket! omg its sooo sexy i thing im going to make love to it right now after i download my music on it!
2,No wonder easy scratch is really a concern....,"Just use for 2 weeks. Then, you will notice lots of scratches...If you don't care about scratch, then it's ok. But, scratches are really bothering for this luxury item."
2,Ipod 4 gb,I saw nothing in the advertisement to indicate this was a refurbished ipod. It seems to be working great but I thought I was getting a new one.
3,over rated,"Take the very nice IPOD MINI add to it a weak color screen too small to see and take away a chunk of the memory and presto you have the IPOD Nano.As a simple IPOD it is not a bad device, but with a screen to small to really see pictures (and I have VERY good eyes) and with memory gone it is not as good a value as the discontinued Mini.still it is an ipod and you get all the advantages of it, but for my money I'd go with a used mini."

3,XP users beware,"XP is listed above in ""See more system requirements,"" yet customer reviewer Always N Bloom stated, ""There is no way that this 95-98-ME software can be run using XP platform."" I emailed the software company (Nova Development), asking them to confirm that I can run Christian Greeting Card Factory on XP (as stated on Nova's website). Here is their response: ""It was never tested, so you may or may not be able to run it. We have heard users give us answers on both sides. Thank you, Jeff, Customer Service Representative, Nova Development.""BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU HAVE XP, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RUN THIS SOFTWARE."
3,Does not work with Office 2010,"I loved this software to make cards for all my Christian friends. I have windows 7 and it used to work until I upgraded to Office 2010. The software will come up, but I can not print the cards out anymore. How sad..."
2,Disappointed,I have the Greeting Card Factory Version 3 and love it but wanted more religious cards so ordered the Art Explosion Christian Greeting Card Factory thinking I would have good results. I was very disappointed that the selections for each category were so limited and verses seemed to be repeated more often than in my other software. I paid just as much for it as I had the other program but received only 25% as many options. I wouldn't recommend it for that price. CC
2,"A Waste of time-Buy the ""Complete Hank Williams"" set","Hank was the greatest country singer of all time and ranks with Frank Sinatra in the popular music field. Even the out-of-print ""40 Greatest Hits"" double set doesn't do him justice. Go ahead and get the 10-c.d. ""Complete Hank Williams."" He's worth it! Besides, prices are firming up, the set won't always be available, and you can leave it to your descendents. To them, it'll be like listening to Abraham Lincoln or George Washington."
2,Thornton's Talking Critters,"Burgess was the model for talking animal stories. His characters use good English, are modeled on real behavior of the beast in question, and there is a minimal plotline. Mostly written for what is now about a first to third grade level, the stories are a good 'read aloud' for pre-schoolers as well. Move on from these to Wind in the Willows (Grahame), Wainscot Weasel, or Brian Jacques' Redwall series."
5,A Great book that any detective fan should not miss,"Sherlock holmes, master consulting detective is at work in 56 short stories and 4 novels, which is everything ever written about the great detective, those of you who have never read sherlock holmes will be addicted after the first story you read, for those of you who have only read some, well here is the rest of them in one book. From a study in scarlet to the adventure of the retired colourman you will come across unique characters, with a variety of cases which range from robbery to murder. if u want proof of how good these stories are listen to this: after sir arthur conan doyle killed off holmes in the final problem, so many fans were trying to get him to come back, so he had no choice to write more, now how does that sound for a fanbase, if u are remotely interested in mysteries or crime, this is the book for you"
3,Where was the proofreader?,"What a shame that such a good collection of stories is ruined by such poor copy editing. It is certainly worth a dollar to have every Sherlock Holmes story in one place, but the typos make some of it almost impossible to read. I'm glad I still have my old hardbound book version of these stories. If you are a fan of these stories and have already read them, this is a great way to have an inexpensive, complete collection. If you want to read these for the first time, seek a more reliable source."
4,Surprised by the quality of the writing,"Being that much of these compilation was written over a hundred years ago the writing is surprisingly modern. All of my experience with Sherlock Holmes has previously been with TV and Movies. The books are much better. Fully fleshed out characters (Holmes isn't someone you'd invite over for dinner unless you needed his expertise), simple but elegant place and mood descriptions. Sir Arthur could write.The only reason I didn't give it a five is that it's obvious Sir Arthur was tiring of the character and was sometime just punching out the stories to meet the demand. Still, hidden inside most stories is some redeemable character or place description."
4,"Better early, than late","When I ordered this two-book combo, I had already read a copy of the first volume. This set was actually bought in order to replace it after a ""water-damage incident."" I also wanted to read the second volume, to find out what the rest of the story was. With this set, you might as well have both books. But if you don't, I prefer the first over the second.I'll just state that part, if not most, of the second half could have been left unwritten. As one of the short stories says, Sherlock himself would write 'dry', actionless accounts, and this seems to have happened in ""The Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes."" This is somewhat remedied in a m""made for T.V."" series- starring Jeremy Brett- which makes any storyline changes seem light-handed."
3,I love these stories!,"The stories of course are amazing. I think I'd rather buy a better quality copy next time. Perhaps I would even get each book separately. Don't get me wrong, I use these copies to read on the train for about two semesters, but they're just so big! And the one I used is falling apart, but don't take my word for it because I put it through hell.It comes with two books, the first of which is thicker than any textbook I've ever owned. I never actually got to open the second one because I ended up getting a tablet. If you weren't aware, I think all these books are public domain and the e-books are available for free on all the book stores apps.All in all, a decent set for the price. This was definitely a great deal before I got my tablet. But don't expect them to last very long and they're not very practical for everyday reading."
5,Amazing!,"Buy this if you like and want to read Sherlock Holmes! By the way, the typos that people keep talking about, aren't even typos. They're just spelled the British way. In Europe and Canada, some words are spelled differently."
4,The Complete Sherlock Holmes (leatherbound),"The book is beautiful, and I appreciate having the stories in one volume. That being said, there are numerous misspelled words. I stopped counting after twenty-five. A visually appealing edition, but is it really so hard to correct the obvious typos?"
5,"The series was great, ACD is as thrilling today as ever!","I loved this series. As soon as I read one Sherlock Holmes Adventure I absolutely had to read them all. No other cunning detectives I have ever read of compare to the legendary sleuth mind of SH. You can follow Holmes and Watson from the time they meet, through Watson's marriage, Holmes' cocaine habits, the death of Moriarty, to Holmes' retirement. If you love good mysteries you won't be able to put these down. The only problem is that ACD didn't write more."
1,Bantam Books,Just bought a book by Bantam Books. Probably the worst printed book I have ever purchased. Printed words so close to the binding you can barely read them. I will definitely stay away from Bantam Books in the future.
3,missing stories and typos,"It was a good collection but it has multiple typos: spelling, punctuations, and quotations. It is missing ten short stories: ALMOST THE ENTIRE CASEBOOK OF SHERLOCK HOLMES excluding ""the mazarin stone"" and ""the problem of thor bridge."" Other than that it is a great read and if they ever revise it I will be the first to get it."
4,Fascinating stories about the world's greatest sleuth,"I loved reading this collection! However, there were so many typos that it was distracting: sometimes 2 to a standard page. The typos were not ""old English"" spellings, but were all typos that would not be picked up by a spell checker. For example, the word ""know"" was spelled as ""now,"" and ""there"" was spelled as ""here."" I highly recommend the Sherlock Holmes series, but would get a different version. It would be worth the extra few cents to get a cleaner copy."
2,"Great content, but poor formatting for Kindle","I love Sherlock Holmes, and thought this would be a great thing at a great price.Trouble is, it doesn't look all that great on the Kindle. They don't use typesetter's quotes (smart quotes), and so it looks more like an old DOS screen than a book, especially given how much dialog is in these books. Other books on the Kindle look a lot better.If you care about your ebooks looking like books, don't get this edition.I recommend this edition instead:The Complete Sherlock Holmes (Collection of all his adventures; 9 Volumes in one Book)"
4,Time to finish?,"Time to start reading! The height of the books are about the size of a mechanical pencil + one inch and they are fairly thick. Its going to take you a pretty long time to finish these, money well spent."
2,Sherlock Holmes: the Complete Collection,"I purchased this item at Amazon for my Kindle. The text started out fine, but later on was filled with misspellings, typos, etc. Also, it was NOT a complete collection. Only two of the 12 ""Casebook of Sherlock Holmes"" stories were included! I wish there was some way the items could be better-screened so purchases could be made on an informed basis. Oh, well, caveat emptor!"
4,Reasonably priced Holmes Collection,"Anyone who is at least moderately interested in mystery stories should make an effort to make themself familiar with Sherlock Holmes. It is widely known that Holmes is one of the best fictional detectives ever, but it it surprising how many people have not actually read any of his stories. The Gramercy Books edtion of the Complete Sherlock Holmes (ISBN 0517220784) is probably the best deal as it is the cheapest hardcover edition I have been able to find (Holmes deserves hardcover). This is definitely a book that any self-respecting mystery lover will locate on his shelf. One small note is that the print is a little on the small side (newspaper size) and is in two columns, but this merely allows the book to avoid being an oversized monstrosity like some other editions are."
5,A Masterpiece ...,"Here we have the complete cannon of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes works. Four Novels and 56 short stories. Usually, collections like this are poorly put together with unnecessary frills and padding. Here we have nothing but pure gold.Anyone who likes mystery, or literature must read the cannon of Holmes. See the famous expressions like ""the game is a foot"", and ""when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable must be the truth""... Most enjoyable to me are Holmes amazing observations -where he looks at someone and can tell what they had for breakfast, and where they were a week ago from the dust on their shoes. It's really a fun read!So, if you want to solve the mystery of what to read next, the answer is elementary my good friends... Buy this book!Relic113"
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR!,"I missed the several reviews that said this edition was MISSING TEN STORIES! Complete? Hardly! NOT every Sherlock Holmes story written by Doyle. If that's what you are looking for, this ISN'T IT!"
3,"Great value, but flawed","This is a review of the 99 cent Kindle version. A complete Sherlock Holmes collection for less than a dollar would be a good value no matter what, but a large number of typographical errors started to become annoying. Mostly these are incorrect words substituted for the correct word, implying that the people who formatted it relied too heavily on spell checkers after importing scanned text. One error was a completely missing section of a whole sentence. I have purchased the more expensive (relatively speaking) $3.25 version, and will see if it's better."
2,Wrong item reviewed,I thought I would be reading reviews of the Naxos audiobooks Sherlock Holmes.Instead there are reviews of the printed book version. Why didn't somebody at Amazon catch this? Where do I find reviews for the audiobooks version?
1,sherlock is the schizz !!! apple allen in alabama,"spending time with this great classic is like hooking up with an old boyfriend! time has enhanced perception,love, & appreciation. even without jude law!/"
1,Let's Get Small,"This, without any doubt, is the smallest type I have ever seen in a book. Ever.There must be 10,000 words on a page.You know how Ripley's Believe-It-Or-Not has the entire King James bible on a postage stamp?Sort of like that.UNreadable."
2,Typos mar an otherwise great value,"The stories themselves are, of course, beyond reproach. And the value of all four novels and all the short stories for under a buck is ridiculous. However, the number of typos here is outrageous, and it's particularly off-putting here because of the exquisite craft of the writing. There were several instances in the first few stories I read where a series of typos changed the meaning of the story, causing me to go back and re-read. The exact kind of irritating experience I don't want when I'm reading purely for pleasure. Why can't someone simply proofread and correct the Kindle version before it's published? I am sure they've sold a thousand Kindle versions of this book. If Amazon charged $1.49 instead of $.99, they could pay some smarty-pants grad student $500 to proofread and I bet they'd have lost very few sales. Instead, I find myself once again reluctant to purchase any book written before the Kindle era."
4,"good price, but many minor typos",It was great having all 60+ Sherloch Holmes stories. There were a large amount of typos (not Victorian English!). The price was great though.
5,"Great Find, Great Shipping, Great Price","The books are amazing reads!! My husband and I read them to each other on long road trips. It has become a ""thing"" for us to have a Sherlock Holmes story handy when we travel.The package shipped VERY quickly and was in GREAT condition!"
2,Good as far as it goes,"The book is not quite as advertised. There are 46 short stories in this Kindle edition. Doyle wrote 56 Holmes short stories. I counted them in my hard bound edition of a complete Sherlock Holmes works. THE FALSE ADVERTISING IS THE PHRASE "" (Every Sherlock Holmes story written by Doyle!) "". NOT TRUE! Other than this it is a good collection with a working linked-TOC. The stories left out must still not be available in inexpensive e-text due to their copy-write date."
5,Magnificent!,An absolutely spectacular value. To pay only 99-cents for such a comprehensive and well done collection of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's seminal creation of detective fiction seems almost criminal! I LOVE this ebook collection! A standing ovation to the publishers! The only way it could be improved upon would be if illustrations were included. I would especially be thrilled if Sydney Pagget's original illustrations from The Strand magazine were added to this edition.
4,Great book,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I was not previously that familiar with Sherlock Holmes mysteries, but very much enjoyed all of them."
2,VERY Small Type Makes Reading Difficult (Impossible?),"The typeface is very small. This is a problem with buying books online; there is just no way to know if the font used is average-sized and readable -- or excruciatingly tiny and sure to bring on a case of eyestrain. These books are the latter.If microscopic print doesn't bother you, these two are a very nice set in a shelf-box. I'd love them - except I can't see them. Too bad, really.Since there is no preview that can inform a potential buyer as to font-size, I felt my review would focus on this, so as to alert those interested."
3,"Content fine, typeface small","The two books include all of Doyles' SH writings, which is good. The typeface is very small, however, in case your eyesight is not good."
3,Really starting to wonder about the Kindle,"This is the second book that I've downloaded to my kindle that is ruined by excessive typos, the first beingThe Most Dangerous Game - New Century Edition with DirectLink Technology. I LOVE the idea of moving away from paper media, but what the ****'s the point when publishers don't care enough to edit out the typos. I had read as far as the Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle in my print copy, so I started there. Everything seemed to be all right until I got into the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes where all of a sudden the volume becomes plagued with typos to the extent that I've now opted to go back to reading the print version.What is it that makes publishers think readers reading on a digital device don't care about spelling?Navigating the content is easy enough, and I love the stories, but I can't justify a rating any higher than OK for a version that is so riddled with typos."
1,The print IS too small!,"The book is oversized but I agree with the previous reviewer that the print is too small--luckily, I found ""The Annotated Sherlock Holmes"" edited by William S. Baring-Gould at a used bookstore and is the BEST complete Sherlock Holmes collection I have EVER seen and the supplemental material is extensive and staggeringly wonderful--try to find that one (it will probably be in 2 volumes)in the used book section of this site..."
2,hard back is too clumsy,I received the hard back and it is too difficult to read (2 columns of print per page of very small print) I'm going to buy the paperback which looked a lot more reader friendly.
3,Shocking Number of Typos,"The stories are great, and the edition is easy to navigate but there are is an unacceptable number of typos. I believe there is another complete collection of ""Holmes"" stories that is also 99 cents. Maybe it has less typos?"
1,What an insult to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,"This is the smallest type I have ever seen also, as another reviewer pointed out. Since the Great Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was probably not a midget, the publishers of this atrocity have done the impossible and that is to make the stories of Sherlock Holmes unreadable. Yes, UNREADABLE. There is another book of the complete Sherlock Holmes and it is CHEAPER. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THE PAPERBACK.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle deserves much better than this and so do you, his patient, yet victimized readers. Something like this needs a spit on the ground. My apology to the family of the great Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Another thing, Why does everyone seem to forget that the SIR in Doyle's name. HE WAS KNIGHTED IN 1902 AND THEY'RE STILL NOT CALLING HIM SIR! AGHHHH!Sir Arthur Conan Doyle1859-1930"
3,So Confused!,"When I got to the book, ""The Sign of Four"", it was the story of Joseph Smith and the Mormons populating Salt Lake. The next book was as it should be, but would have liked to have ""The Sign of Four"", and not feel like a religious belief was being pushed on me. Anyone else have this issue?"
3,Alzheimers,"Explains how different forms of dementia show themselves and how they are likely to progress. Offers advice on dealing with problems as they arise, on seeking professional help and on trying to see the sufferers' point of view. Discusses the emotional stress carers go through and suggests ways of keeping the strain to a minimum, the possible causes of dementia and the search for a cure, and, the legal and financial problems that may arise."
3,Actually Good,"I'm not too fond of National Lampoon's films, but this one was actually a Canadian film first. It's not bad. You have your average breasts and gross-out sexual humor (a staple of any teen sex comedy) In the end it's sweet and has a heart. Avril Lavigne's cameo is horrible, and as an American, I enjoyed seeing the sights of Canada."
3,"""Going the Distance"" (2004)","brief plot outline: buckle your seat belts for extreme comedy- National Lampoon is taking you on the road! In the bawdy tradition of ""American Pie"" and ""Eurotrip"", this rapid-fire funfest is the ultimate coming-of-age experience, where the rules get broken, and the laughs come a mile a minute!When three hard-up high school grads jump in an RV and skip town, they have no idea it's going to be the most outrageous ride of their lives! Encountering every kind of cross-country craziness- from meeting beautiful hitchhikers and Avril Lavigne to running afoul of the law, two brutal bar babes and a bigwig on the music scene (Jason Priestly)- these helplessly hedonistic horn-dogs are in for the ultimate education!"
2,Invest your money elsewhere to learn to write romance...,"I'm sure this set of tapes was very good in its day. The problem is that its day came along about 20 years ago. If you want to learn about the history of the genre and some of the basic subdivisions its contains...category, historical, regency, etc., then you might find this series to have some small value to you. But if you want to learn about the genre as it operates today, your money would be better spent on the new edition of ""How to Write a Romance"" by Kathryn Falk, publisher of Romantic Times Magazine. Ms. Wilbee needs to do a serious update of this series in order for it to be of any value today."
2,My hamsters did not like it.,"I bought 2, one for each of my hamsters. Neither one went inside it nor did they acknowledge it. I think it was too small for them. I recommend this product for the smaller dwarf hamsters. When I place them in it, it just fit them but left no room for them to do anything. Would you want to sleep in cramped quarters?"
4,Ghetto Dawg,"Very genre specific, I enjoyed it because it was filmed close to my hometown, part of the draw of the movie for me was seeing the places near my home, and the use of local actors and actresses as extras. This movie was shot before hurricane Sandy and features shots of the Jersey Shore that you can no longer see."
2,Not the best I've ever seen,"This movie is worth owning if you can find it cheaply and you're an American Pit Bull Terrier enthusiast and want everything related to the breed. That's the best I can say about it.Otherwise, hang on to your money, or rent a copy. I've got an old VHS version of this movie, and in all the years I've had it, I believe I've only watched it twice. (And I think it likely that the 2nd viewing was just to make sure that I hadn't missed any redeeming qualities that the film didn't appear to have.) The high point for me was when one of the characters couldn't pronounce Durango. The rest of the movie was so bad I've blocked most of it out. Just chalk it up to an hour and a half of my life that I'll never get back.Sorry I can't give a more detailed review, but that just gives you an idea of how lame this movie is. I can't remember anything about it except the basics of the plot. And nothing about it would inspire me to go back and reacquaint myself."
4,"A fun, light-hearted, original story with potential.","This book is entertaining, and has has a lot of potential. The story, set in a world that's a bizzare blend of modern-day US and feudal Japan, is fast-paced, intriguing, and delightfully original - a young samurai, the last one who remembers the way of Bushido, struggles to make ends meet in a world where Samurai are unionized, lazy, and corrupt.The art, while very cartoony, is also very underrated - the wealth of little details generously sprinkled throughout the book testifies to the amount of work and dedication that went into making the story (see if you can spot a homeless Uncle Sam lookalike begging for money on the street)The only initial drawback is the format - like Japanese manga, Blade for Barter is meant to be read right-to-left. However, that takes very little time to adjust to, and stops being an issue farily quickly.Overall, a really fun read. Looking forward to volume 2."
2,Depressing,"The author seems to be angry at God and it is shown by his very low opinion of God. His characterizations of God and His motives are far from Biblical truth. He attributes God as having been ""lured (by Satan)...into torturing the innocent Job."" (p. 32). It is clear that Mr. Miles' lacks an understanding of certain basic hermeneutic and exegetical principles."
3,"Interesting Read, Milk not Meat","No doubt Miles is a gifted author. The book has a great story line to work with, but it lacks the authority to bring clarity to the subject. I much more enjoyed ""Jesus The Christ"" by James Talmage."
4,Jesus:A crisis in the life of god,A new and exciting look at the scriptures and their true meaning of Jesus' role in God's relationship with mankind. It will challenge your thinking and understanding of the role of Jesus' in the New Testament.
1,This is supposed to be humor?,"I wrote a longer review on this book a while back,but for some reason it was not posted.I really didn't enjoy it at all and had a hard time wading through it,but I did.This book is so self -centered that it lacked any humor. If you think of the better stand up comics such as Buttons,Skelton,Mason,Dangerfield,Gleason,Carney,Hope,Cohen,or just about anyone you can think of ;you'll find that the object of their humor is self-directed.Anyway,if you like the humor of the ones I've mentioned;you won't find it in this book."
1,It stinks and I don't like it.,"There is not one laugh in this book. Save your money, you can get more laughs from an obituary column."
4,Nothing Wrong with 2 different versions,Great album with occasionally muddy sound. Just a note - the US and UK versions have a different track listing and the versions of Only Dreaming and The Rise are totally different mixes on the two. US track listing is:1. Nothing Wrong2. Open Up3. Hands Off Me4. Big Stick5. She Said6. Sayonara7. World Around8. Hard-Away9. The Rise10. Only Dreaming (Wide Awake)11. Do You Understand?12. Never Know13. Pushing On14. Time Is Tight
3,Red Lorry Yellow Lorry..........Desperately,"Chris Reed and Company deliver the goods with their special brand of melancholic, post punk rock approach. No psychedelia here. A pounding, feedback driven controlled frenzy that takes no prisoners. Serious business here. Machine gun drum riffs, wailing lead guitar, nightmarish droning vocals. What else do you want! Compares favorably to Joy Division at their most aggressive. This band kicks ___, and takes no prisoners live, if you were so lucky. Dig this, and you will love all the others. More proof that the eighties weren't devoid of great rock bands! The contrarians to the wimp rock of the period. They carried the torch brightly."
4,Great math text.,We used this book for our homeschool 4th grade math. It was very easy to use and to teach. Ready made test and answer books that accompany the book make teaching math a snap. Lessons progress at a manageable rate. Lots of skills review. Concentrates heavily on basic mathematic skills such as multiplication and division.
5,a lifesaver,Since I first used the Saxon math series I was hooked. I was looking for a thorough math curriculum for my children with enough review and this is it! This level 5/4 is no exception.
1,Boring and unfair. Just plain Horrible!,I think that they should give you only eighty math problems on facts practices in the earlier lessons. They make you do it in FIVE MINUTES! Should they expect kids to be good automatically? NO! Kids should work at their own rate. How could a beginning fourth grader finnish one hundred math problems in five minutes?!? They don't even try to make it fun for kids who despise math! Just because you're in fourth grade doesn't mean education has to be strict and boring!!!
1,"""Some, some more""??","My son is currently using this text in the fourth grade, and I was appalled when I flipped through his book the other day. Instead of seeing simple, common terminology such as ""add"" or ""subtract"", I saw ""some, some more"" and ""larger, smaller, difference"". What this book has done is take basic concepts that are familiar to nine-year-olds and convoluted them, apparently trying to make simple tasks even easier. With books like these, which fail to use standard terminology, it's no wonder that America's youth is struggling with math skills. Addition and subtraction are basic skills that all students must know, and this book is doing our bright kids a disservice."
1,It is for the audience,"""Pleasure is the absence of pain"" was how one philosopher phrased it, I don't remember who it was, as I was looking out the window at a jaybird when my boy, who has a PHD, was talking it up. Now, I don't know how much shocking or flogging or punching jailbirds will stop them doing their plainfaced bad deeds, but it sure will make a lot US out here feel GOOD. WE didn't get put in prison. Tailgating and backstabbing and firing people because you don't like them and all the mean stuff we enjoy doing out here ain't illegal, and we ain't got CAUGHT at the stuff that IS. YET. Put this corporate punishment on TV, where we can all watch it. Who knows if that fellow DID the stuff they say he did, or whether YOU did it and didn't get CAUGHT, but you can GUARANTEE that you'll FEEL GOOD because it's happening to SOMEONE ELSE.That is my two cents.Review by O. J. Haney."
5,A Gem!,"This is an ""unabidged and unaltered repliication of the work originally published 1947"" which ""is printed in an edition limited to 400 copies"" by Amereon House, the publishing division of Amereron Ltd.It includes the text and ilustrations of Lear's five pubished nonsense works and Holbrook Jackson's introduction titled ""Edward Lear: Laureate of Nonsense"".A book to share and to treasure...Order your copy while stocks last."
4,The Complete Nonsense of Edward Lear,"It was the works of Edward Lear that popularized the term limerick, and since these illustrations and stories were originally created by Edward Lear about one hundred years ago, you will need to take this into consideration when reading this book. It is quaint, but entertaining in its way, though don't expect to understand its message completely. It is nonsense after all. I am glad to have it and find it inspirational when considering certain artistic projects. It is fun, but dumb and that is the intention I believe. Very Kooky and certainly wacky, it rolls on and on. Try it, you will feel saner and more rational after sampling its pages."
1,C300 4matic does not fit,"This item matches ""what fits your car"", but caused my car to hesitate, like it had too much/little air.I picked up new filters from the dealer yesterday ...and those were actually 1/4"" longer...and this fixed my problem.2009 4matic sport."
5,MBZ air filters - OEM for MBZ - fits as advertised,"Save yourself some coin and use the MANN filters on your MBZ - the air intake shroud on my '08 E350 actually has ""MANN"" labeling in the plastic stamping. Fit perfect."
4,"cool, music, cool español!!!","in the new era of español music, this Aterciopelados leads the sound of the new generation of rock musicians, with fresh lyrics and with music sometimes remember me, punk rock, almost a mystery. Keep cool ""mis amigos"""
5,Entertaining and Fun,"This has been a really fun CD for my daughters. It includes songs, poems and stories about the seasons (leaves blowing, riding on a swing, walking to school). The lyrics are sung in a clear, appealing voice and sound like they are truly being sung to a group of children. My four-year-old daughter listens to it at least once a day and often more. Some songs include movement, while others invite the listener to sing along. The CD winds down to some soothing songs at the end. The CD insert includes all the lyrics and suggestions for variations for the songs. This is one of our favorites."
4,PETERSON PLAYS THE CLAVICHORD (PETERSON SUONA LA SPINETTA),"First : Oscar Peterson plays the clavichord - not piano - and Joe Pass the acoustic guitar.Second : if you know the first thing, we can say this is an excellent disc, because the songs are wonderful and the musician are formidable.Obviously the sounds are very different than our habits: just the first track, ""Summertime"", can give you a turn.Later, slowly, we can understand that Peterson, when wanted to play the clavichord for this recording (in 1976), was not crazy, naturally: the songs from ""Porgy and Bess"" are some of the most performed standards, another version was needless, if he cannot try something new.And some pieces are very good, with these instruments: play ""It ain't necessarily so"", for example, ""I got Plenty o'nuttin"" , ""There is a boat..."".Joe Pass is very good to maintain the romantic tone of music, even if the metallic sound of the clavichord, and his performance is really magnificent."
1,HARPSIWHAT?,ONE OF THE WORST RENDITIONS OF PORGY & BESS I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF LISTENING TO . WHOEVER THOUGHT A HARPSICORD WAS A PLEASING INSTRUMENT TO LISTEN TO??? THAT'S WHY THEY INVENTED PIANOSISN'T IT? PLEASE PUT THIS WHERE SOME OTHER UNSUSPECTING CUSTOMER WILL SEE IT AND RECONSIDER BUYING IT.
1,splinter,I purchased these for Christmas and I was disappointed that these bones splinter. I guess I got what I paid for.
3,Shooting Caterpillars in Spain,"This book was interesting enough, but NOT what I expected after reading a review in the NY Times. There is lots of ""British humor"" that I just did not get. I almost put it down mid-way, but did manage to finish. Maybe if you are Brtitish you'll love it?"
5,The first book in my all-time favorite time-travel series!,"I found ""The Ivanhoe Gambit"" in a used book store back around '90 and absolutely devoured it! It took about a year (and a chance meeting with the author) to collect the rest of the books in the series. If you like tightly written time-travel stories, the idea of adventure and intrigue in a fascinating medieval setting, plus a great set of interesting and believable characters, GET THIS BOOK! And, while you can, collect all the other books in the series and become a Time Wars addict like me. More, Simon--please!"
4,"Groat stery, but lots of typographical orrers!","If you can wade through and dicipher all the typos, this is a very enjoyable book."
5,The 1st in a Timeless Series!,"Simon Hawke's debut novel in his short-lived TimeWars series is top-notch entertainment from the first page to the last. What authors like Tolkien did for fantasy, Simon Hawke did for sci-fi time travel. If you've never read this series, well do yourself a favor and find them. Well worth the effort and money.Classic stuff!"
4,A book that crosses sci-fi and medevil warfare,"The book starts out like some far fetched story about some futuristc time-line keepers who sign up for kicks jumping all over the past. But befor you know it, you can""t put it down. I think the writers of the movie ""TIMECOP"" based alot of their movie off of this book, but I think the book was alot more interesting. I highly recomend this book!"
3,Nice Movie,It was a very good movie But what ever you do DO NOT SEE HIGH NOON AT MEGA MOUNTAIN it stunk
2,This movie is bad.,"And embarrassing. It's not a total loss, no because it can be entertaining...but only once in a while. Sure, the kids will probably like it , and even worse, try to imitate it but really, if you're not 6, 7 or younger, I wouldn't waste your time. That's what this was - a BIG waste of time.And it's so over exaggerated...Ugh.Not recommended."
1,3 ninjas,my favorite one is colt.he`s cool.he kiks those bad guys but.so whatever you do dont fight colt
4,GOOD MOVIE,"This movie is a great movie for kids. I enjoyed it as a young child or preteen and now my son (age 5) loves all three movies. It has some cheesy acting but it is overall good. My favorite is the first one; however, all of them make my son belly laught. All three ninja movies are without rude or vulgar humor and there isn't any bad language. Adults too will enjoy the movie as long as you realize it is geared toward children. I would say the target audience is between the ages of 4 and 10 and the movie will definetely meet their expectations."
1,this is sucked,I thought it was dumb and so did everyone I know. The fighting was not realistic and the acting was horribel.
3,3 ninjas are at it again !!!,Well this is the 3rd installment on the series and to say it was ok but it was not as good as the other two.The original Rocky and Tum Tum return for there 3rd and last returns as the ninjas.The movie about a man that was dumping a lot of waste in the land where the indian people left and they help a girl that is looking for here father that has a disc that contains the chemicals there dumping in the fields.I really like the movie and there was alot of comedy and action but overal its alright but not as good as the other two.
1,Kids movie,Kids movie not too much in it for an adult. Very violent and lots of it. My granddaughters did like.
1,"HARDY, HAR, HAR! THIS JUST ISN'T FUNNY!","I may be one of the few people in the world who really doesn't like ""The Honeymooners."" The tiresome lines, the weak plots and the stab at acting do nothing to make this show appealing. One major flaw with ""The Honeymooners"" is that the show is so darn BORING! You can predict the story and outcome right away.The tiresome lines and stilted phrases are bad enough, but the dreaded ""homminas"" are extremely annoying. Add to this mix Alice the big mouth, Ralphie Boy the cliche spouting windbag, Norton the Irritant and Dishrag Trixie. Fat jokes and chauvinism are abound in any ""Honeymooners"" collection and this is no exception."
2,Very disappointed!,"I haven't watched the whole dvd yet, but after watching the Christmas one I'm not interested. The only thing I did like were the differant parts Jackie Gleason played. This was supose to be a Christmas show, but it certainly didn't seem like a Christmas show to me. This was a gift for someone and after watching it together we were both VERY diasppointed!"
2,So Simple,"'Straw Men' is a disappointingly simple book. Mr. Smith guides the reader along a predictable and sometimes aggravatingly obvious path throughout the story. The clues in this mystery novel leave nothing for the reader to deduce on their own.There is no reason you'll need your brain for this read. Everything will be throughly explained to you and that is what is so sad about it. You are treated like a obtuse three year-old.If don't think it's suspicious when a beat cop has a $50k Mercedes SUV as a second vehicle, this book might be a good challenge for you. Otherwise stick to James Patterson or James Lee Burke.I give this book two stars for the sole fact that it takes place in Pittsburgh."
4,Great Music!,"Ignore the other reviewer. Tiny is a master.I guess the other reviewer was expecting something else -- maybe the ""blues"" title threw him off?"
4,Clear Thinking through the Hysteria,"Albert Jay Nock's The Myth of a Guilty Nation is a double-barreled, no-holds-barred attack on the Treaty of Versailles. Nock viewed the war-guilt clause of the treaty (which placed total blame for WWI upon the Germans) as a piece of moralistic buncombe which would get the United States and her allies in trouble down the road. His predictions in this matter were more correct than most people writing during the time. Nock was one of the critics of our war policy who remained true to his cause throughout the war and refused to be silenced. Never one to jump on any band-wagon, Nock rips into Wilsonian idealism as well as French and British diplomatic duplicity. A must read for any understanding of the Versailles Treaty, its presuppositions and its consequences."
5,Just what I needed,"Unless you want to chop out your original stereo wiring harness, this is the trick. Yes, you could chop it out, but if you ever sell your car and want to put the original radio back in it's slot,,,,,,then this item is the ticket for you."
3,Nice for kids - few annoyances.,"Overall, I think it's a good idea. Nice concept for kids. My boys are 6 and 7, and they each got one for Christmas.Two annoying things about the players:1 - the detachable caps. In order to charge or download music, the cap must be removed. There's no way to keep it attached to the player. This is a fairly critical flaw for something made for *kids*.2 - so far - play time is NOT 8 hours. Maybe we have a defective ""charger"" (the disney speaker stand was purchased also, and it seems defective). The MP3 player only played for 3 hours total - mostly on the stand, and only about 10 minutes off the stand before the player stopped working.Invest in a USB wall charger.I'm also NOT a fan of Disney's Mix Clips. So I won't waste my money on those. The player holds enough music for kids, and I find our Veggie Tales collection enough to keep the boys happy.Think about it before you buy it. It's ""Okay""."
1,RIght idea...bad player...,"Do yourself a favor and don't buy one of these. The support is poor and worst of all our Mix Stick in the ""chrome blue"" stopped playing about 4 months after we bought it. My 8 yr old son got it for a Xmas gift and loved it then it just died. You could plug it into your computer and it wouldn't recognize it so there was just nothing you could do. I researched it quite a bit trying to fine some answers but to no avail.If you are going to get an MP3 player I suggest that you get an MP3 player with better support, longer warranty and has a battery you can replace. For the same price my Philips SA1110 1GB has all these things and it's now my son's."
1,Waste of money,"We bought this mix stick for our daughter for an 8th birthday gift. We thought it a great intro to the world of MP3 players. It is easy enough to use, just plug into your computer and load songs on it. It works like a flash drive. BUT, 6 months later it stopped working, for no reason. This child is very careful with her things and it truly just stopped. I tried to solve the problem myself, but there is NO online support for this thing. Just some useless FAQs. I called Memorex customer service and was told the warranty was 45 days and to replace was $38. Of course I could get her a new one for about $5 more. This is NOT WORTH THE MONEY for only 45 days of guranteed service. Spend $30 more and get an ipod shuffle. More storage space, cute colors and WAY better warranty and online support."
5,Beautiful music,I love John Rutter anyway but this album was wonderfully cheerful! I used several of the songs in my wedding as the wedding party processed in. It fit perfectly!
4,Works not so crazy,i've use this program to also extract frams and edit them with photo impact then put them back into video format. It the best extractor i've found so far but it does crash on anymore then 300 frames being extracted. the main reason is as stated by the reviewer before me to crisp up chroma key back grounds. long and boring but well worth doing frame by frame
2,NEVER MIND the file size....,"Over and over again I tried to slice the file size of finished animation - to no avail.Yes - if you only used a postage stamp size image you might get by with being able to use it on your website with a halfway decent loading time.We tried to use the gif animator in our gallery on several occasions - guranted, with high quality images of max filesize 12kb each (can't go any lower if anyone is to see any quality at all) and the finished, so called improved file size still was larger than any website page can carry - unless you want to wait for the 30-45 seconds for that single instance to load - no one does, not even at the best websites. So, we have another 'wonderful' program dusting away on our shelves."
4,Jocassee Gorges Guide has a good Map,"The written information in this guide is somewhat dated, but still useful. The trails and facilities in the Gorges State Park are evolving constantly, and if you are planning on visiting there, it would be best to contact the park for current hours, etc. However, the topo map detailing the roads ( and some of the trails ), which is a part of the guide is worth the price of admission until someone comes out with something better."
3,Great Mix,"Charles Stross held my interest quickly and kept it. I spent about six hours over two days on the book and although at times I found it a little hard to follow some of the jargon and the names gave me some trouble I enjoyed it. I would recommend to others who also found time travel interesting or enjoyed intrigue as well as fantasy. This is my first experience with Charles Stross and although I prefer stand alone novels in a series I will probably buy the second novel. If Mr. Stoss had completed this story I would have given him a 4.75. It is a great line of thought, interesting, well presented and unique to my reading experience, but I do not enjoy being left hanging."
2,not good,"unbelievable protagonist. silly situation. ridiculous decisions. just not good. I rarely put a book away before finishing it, even bad ones but I couldn't make it to halfway."
2,A distinct lack of snark,"Let me start by saying I love Charles Stross. His Laundry Files series is snarky and well-written, funny and with good and complex characters.That's why this book was such a disappointment. If this exact book had been written by someone with less potential, I'd probably have enjoyed it more -- but I bought it being familiar with Stross' track record on his later novels, and was expecting more than I got.The book's biggest flaw, besides an incomprehensible political situation with warring clans of merchants, is that so much of the story comes from exposition. Rather than having his characters really experience the world, and the story being shown rather than told, the characters spout huge blocks of expository dialogue, so they end up telling you more than showing you.I'd say stay away from this one. It's not horrible, but it's not interesting enough to try and slog through the dialogue and the politics to try to find the nuggets of good story."
4,more a SF action adventure than fantasy (which I see as good),"Since others have outlined the plot of this book, I will just say that I enjoyed reading it. However, the author does seem to have a lot of trouble with the various relationships of Miriam's family. First, her mother is her presumed uncle's sister, then his step sister, then possibly a half sister. Roland is variously described as a first cousin to Miriam, then a 2nd cousin, etc. Gets very confusing! Just the same, the concept is fun and Miriam (of course) always gets out of a jam. I still don't know just why, on her first visit to the alternate world, there was a knight in armor shooting at her with an automatic weapon. Forget the strange juxtoposition of that - why was he shooting at her in the first place, instead of trying to capture her and find out who she was and how she arrived on the road he was travelling.A good, fast book, if you are looking for a fast read."
1,Couldn't get past first 50 pages,"I thought I'd try this out because I enjoy Zelanzy's Amber series, and people have compared this effort to it.Unfortunately, I could only read about the first 50 pages, and I certainly wasn't drawn into it. Even on a long airline flight with nothing better to do, I couldn't pick it back up.The main character is petty and navel gazing. I realize you can start a main character one way and let them develop over time, but I think I was supposed to like her... anyway, I couldn't stand to hear one more observation through her perceptions. Back to the library it goes."
1,Buy the paperback if you must,"I'd have to agree with an earlier review of this book in that ""The Family Trade"" is a vehicle for future books in the series. By itself, there's not a whole lot of substance although it has some interesting ideas. I regret buying the hardback version of this book."
1,"Suspend your disbelief, and then suspend it some more...","Start with a good premise.Then fill it with so many holes that you can drive Mack trucks through it...I found that reading this story only had me thinking that for a heroine who was so smart so often, and able to predict life threatening situations with such great ability, she was certainly unable to see how many ways she could have been eliminated so as to make this story a non-starter.Oh, there it is, it dawns on me that if the other characters could see how easily I do that our protagonist could be snuffed out, then the book would have ended. And that is what should have happened. This book should have died in the slush pile."
2,the family trade vol. 1,"i was one of the many people who bought the book in the children's section for a underage child. it's a darn good thing i read it first so i could toss it out. the cuss words are many and not for reading books of children. writter's do not need to put cuss words in a book to sell them for i tossed mine in the garbage. not even whiting out the words would save it. disgusted, a good story had to be ruined."
3,The Subsequent Books Are Better,"If you read this book because you like more recent Stross books, as I do, you may be disappointed. Don't let that stop you from reading the rest of the series. It gets better as it goes along, with more interesting ideas and less of the medieval kings-and-court stuff."
2,A big mess,"The author tells a good story but really needs to work harder. Even the main characters lack definition, and their personalities drift something awful. Some conversations make no sense except from the author's perspective - he alone knows what's going on. Alas, it is a good story, but the price in reader suffering is very high."
2,Not a whole book,"I can't believe anyone would rate this well. It is not a story, it is a portion of a story. 300 loosely packed pages later, Mr. Stross stops the story so that he can sell the next volume for another $7 (or $17 hardcover).It is a sad state of affairs that he can so rest on his laurels as to put this lackluster effort forward.Wait for the combined volume a few years from now, maybe then it will be a worthwhile read."
3,"Great idea, too much filler","Why don't people just write books instead of writing series? It's a rhetorical question, I understand the economic incentives fine. But this is a book with a nice, Amber-like idea (woman discovers she can cross between universes, is princess in alternate world), a decent understanding of what real people would do in that situation (smuggle drugs via alternate world, silly), and a couple of good scenes where loyalties shift, and 300 pages out of about 350 that we could essentially have done without if it meant THE STORY WOULD END IN ONE BOOK."
3,Wait 'til the next book,"There are a number of good reviews below that hit both the strong and weak points of this book. I would just like to add that if you have something else to read, wait until the author writes the other half of this book, then read the whole thing. This one has multiple threads, one introduced near the end, and none of them resolved. If you have a low tolerance for authors who can't complete any part of a storyline in one book, this would not be the book for you."
4,Warning: Seriesbait Ahead,"While The Family Trade is unabashedly the gateway drug for a longer series, it is also a nice little trip. The beginning is a bit exposition-heavy, but the premise is intriguing and well executed. Once the action gets going the book is almost impossible to put down. I won't bother to summarize the plot - there are plenty of other summaries on this page. Suffice to say that I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good time and doesn't mind getting hooked."
2,Cliffhanger ending,"I've bought and read all of the books in this series. The story line is pretty good, but the author loves cliffhanger endings. I won't be buying any more in this series."
1,2 of the DVDs are blank,"2 of the DVDs are blank, I why not recommend this DVD when I cant even see all the episodes, My favorite show but crappy set."
1,Not brand new as described,"I love time trax, and I love collecting movies, the only problem that I have is when I pay a premium price for an item that is supposed to be brand new, but it turns out to be a dv case full of used and scratched/scuffed discs that have obviously seen their way around the break room or wherever some employee decided to watch it. I only come to that conclusion because the item is not from a private seller. It is suppose to be factory direct via amazon. Very disappointing. I begrudgingly will not send it back as I have been waiting a long time for these to be available and I am sure with all o the problems this item has had it probably won't be around very much longer, if you don't care about condition than go for it."
2,Alpha Syndrome,"Specifically regarding Cascadia Lab's Saturday Matinee DVD with Stagecoach to Denver and Homesteaders of Paradise Valley. These two Red Ryder films deserve better.Stagecoach to Denver is from a soft 16mm dupe print which has some segments that are very dark. However, it will suffice for viewing on a small, regular television screen. Don't bother watching on an HD screen.Homesteaders of Paradise Valley is from a substandard 16mm dupe print which is soft but has much surface noise and flickering white horizontal lines. Also, some outdoor scenes are very dark. The soundtrack has an intermittent hum. Overall, this is fair to poor.These are available on Amazon for $2.60 with shipping. I think that is too much. If you can find this at a Dollar store, it is worth a dollar but not more. If you have low standards, you will not be disappointed.Cascadia seems to be like Alpha: sometimes they manage to obtain a good print but most of the time they use whatever they can get for little money."
2,Samsung TV replacement lamp,"I was dissapointed with my original order.I received the wrong part and when I called the number on the package for assistance, they tried to make it my fault that I received the wrong part. They said I got the part I ordered. I did not. I had a copy of my original order that I printed out and I did not get what I ordered. Then, I had to pay to return the wrong part, pay a restocking fee and then pay again to have the right part sent. I finally got the right part but feel I overpaid for it."
1,Failed lamp,"Went to Circuit City where the TV was first purchased. Store associate had to purchase on line at Circuit City Customer Service desk in store for a replacement lamp. One of the vendors that came up was Amazon. Based on price, we decided to purchase. After a little over a year the lamp failed. The original lamp lasted 3 years. Amazon would not stand behind the product, giving only a one year warranty and neither would Samsung. Samsung gives only 90 days. I believe all warranties giving such a minimal time frame for replacement are ridiculous. Great companies like Sears especially the Craftsman line would give you a direct replacement no questions asked, insuring repeat business. I can not afford to keep replacing these costly lamps at $122.00 each. I guess it's customer service SECOND now. I will no longer purchase a product from either Amazon or Samsung."
1,Had I ever received it.,I am still weaiting for the book to arrive. It has been almost a month. Maybe it will arrive some day.
1,What is the point of this book?,Seriously...who in their right mind would spend money and buy this book? You should be certified by a major agency like PADI or NAUI before diving i.e. you get their manuals as part of their training which tells you most of the things you need to know. The rest comes from practise and more advanced training. I think the Dummies series needs to stop wasting paper by printing these useless books and focus on topics where they are actually needed.
5,Great musical variety - BRAVO!,"This was one of the first music purchases for our (then) three-year-old. It was delightful for us as parents to hear the wonderful variety of styles J McCutcheon uses. Our family loves music, but we tend to get bored with CD's that sound the same from song to song. This CD will keep both young and old interested, and our little ones love the lyrics and quickly learn the songs. It is great sing-along travelling music for a captured audience!"
1,What happen to quality of Fram gas filter's ???,"I used this same number of Fram filter before for my Honda. But, When I checked this flter and the other(I bought 2 diffrent filters, the other one for Tocoma). I noticed something is wrong on Fram filter. The filter itself looks the same, but if you looked inside the fitting, they sprayed the black paint inside the thread and sealing areas. How do I know if the paint is not spray inside the filter element? I used magnifying glass to look inside, it seems it does have some black paint. I believe this is wrong, gasoline can melt the paint and cause injector clog up. When I looked at my old filter, both ends had no paint covering the fittings as well as in the thread area.Unless Fram can tell me I am wrong. I will advice reader a zero star for Fram gas filters!! (if there is zero)."
3,"Song of Kali is a dark, depressing novel.","Dan Simmons does great atmosphere.He presents a disturbing picture of Calcutta in Song of Kali. The city's evil, its oppressiveness, is palpable. He casts a fascinating, if thoroughly unflattering, light on Calcutta.Unfortunately, Simmons' characters do not come to life as much as his settings, and we are left with mediocre characters walking on a great stage.Song of Kali is a depressing book filled with mostly unlikeable characters (although the wife of the protagonist is a notable exception). The story and the setting were interesting enough to keep me turning pages in spite of my distaste.Overall, Song of Kali is an unpleasant, yet unforgettable experience."
2,Just kind of weak,"So I guess I was a little gullible for placing any stock in the whole ""most frightening novel ever"" stuff that is plastered all over the cover of this book. Like another review noted, there is the ""germ"" of a good, and frightening, book here. But is never really develops.It is also a little difficult to look past Simmions' disparaging description of the citizens and culture of India. Before beginning the book, I was aware that ""Calcutta as a nexus of evil"" was to be one of the major premises of the story. Still, I expected the author to approach that notion with more sophistication than simply portraying India and Indians as uncivilized and inferior.I purchased this book because I enjoyed one of Simmons' other works, Hyperion. Song of Kali was no where near as good. It was easy to read. The plot developed at a suitable pace. It simply didn't amount to much."
3,A dark journey into horror,"Song Of Kali is only the second book that I've read of Dan Simmons's novels, the first being the truly superb Drood. I wish half stars were available on web sites to rate books other than just the full stars. My true score/ rating for this novel is 3.5 stars. It is a very good read and the length for this particular novel is just about right. It is a dark and depressing story and features some genuine creepy moments, it is not in my view as scary as some make it out to be, well that's in my view. I would definitely read it if you are contemplating doing so. I will say this, Dan Simmons is a superb writer (Drood in particular is a masterful novel, excellent prose)and I will most certainly reading more of his books in the future."
5,"Depressing, disturbing, and SCARY.","Simmon's debut presents an intense character study, not of any human characters, but of the city of Calcutta itself. Indeed, with the notable exception of the narrator's wife, the character developement in this novel is often thin and weak (a problem Simmons almost overcompensates for in his follow up novels). What makes Song Of Kali so effective and terrifying are two things: the attention to detail in describing the sights, smells, oppressive heat, and claustrophobic crowding of the poorest of the poor; and his writing style itself. While the protagonist may be somewhat weak, Simmons makes what happens to him so vivid your disbelief is suspended for you. Even the most horrifying (and supposedly supernatural) events in the story give the reader an out: you don't have to accept a character's description as accurate, not taking a description at face value only hightens the tension and therein lies this novels power."
2,Disappointing,"I was blown away by Dan Simmons' Hyperion series (and I'm not a sci-fi fan), so I was eagerly anticipating this book after reading all the rapturous reviews. I didn't find it scary, just gross - and, overall, terribly sad. It paints a horrible picture of Calcutta, with filth, vermin, death and disease everywhere.It probably says more about me that I have no problem whatsoever believing in vampires, ESP, monsters, ancient gods come to life, etc., but I just can't see why anyone would bring their infant to such a nasty place! ;)"
2,More Pulp Than Poetry,"After all the raves for Simmons' supposedly finely crafted prose, I expected something quite poetic--ala Rushdie. But Simmons' style is a lot closer to Elmore Leonard than I expected. More pulp than poetry. Frankly, I found his writing pedestrian. If you consider the unimaginative M. Night Shyamalan to be an engaging director of horror films, Simmons might bring the night terror you're looking for."
2,A poor book,The book is full of little actions and descriptions which don't have much meaning in the story. Looks like they are here for filling the pages.The text would have needed radical cuttings. At one point I even wondered if Simmons had written it himself; but actually it was his first novel.Slow and pointless.
3,"Well written, good story, but ultimately not very scary","I must say that I truly enjoyed reading this book. Throughout the novel, there is a lot of mystery and encroaching horror. The ultimate payoff, however, is not there and you're left wondering if this is really even a horror novel at all. The Kali figure doesn't even seem real much less hard to get away from. Where's the ancient evil?"
2,Disappointment,The book is extremely predictable and the story is just one cliché after another. One extra star for good depiction of the city.
4,If you're even a little familiar with Kali... it's neither horrific nor frightening.,"For those familiar with Kali even slightly, this book does not even live up to its billing as ""frightening"", let alone ""horror"". Some of the philosophy is rather intriguing: the notion that there is no such thing as evil, only power, and violence ""is an attempt to exercise power"". An interesting read, nonetheless."
3,"Good, but overhyped.","I'll get to the point: the book is good, but not a masterpiece (understandably).Regardless of what the hype on the back cover claims, this is not the scariest book out there. It's not the goriest, not the most depraved, not the most chilling. It's a fascinating view of a city that the book claims is rotten to the core accompanied by a mildly compelling storyline.However, the story resolves itself suddenly without a satisfying conclusion or any real explanation of the book's events. It's an entertaining read, but not the 'masterwork' worthy of many re-reads like the 'Hyperion' books (by this author) are.If you're looking for a horror novel, check out an early-mid Stephen King work. If you're looking for a fantasy (or sci-fi) novel, check Tad Williams, Terry Goodkind, J.R.R. Tolkien, or Ursula K. Leguin."
2,"Entertainingly quick read, but a new edition is needed, badly.","I have never encountered a paperback book of any kind, fiction or non-fiction, that had as many punctuation and spelling errors as this one. It actually became distracting at times. That being said, the story is a decently written novel about India and how it is the worst place in the entire world. I'm looking forward to exploring more about India, partly to figure out what the hell Dan Simmons' problem was with the place. From the one page ""prologue"", it is clear that Simmons is virulently hateful of India.I was told it was one of the scariest novels ever written. While it has managed to haunt my thoughts, I believe that is a result more out of wonder if India is really as evil as it is in the novel."
3,Not for the weak stomach,"Dan Simmons is brilliant at putting you in a place you have never been and your actually feeling like you are really there experiencing all the elements. In Terror you were freezing and hungry as you read it. In Song of Kali you will be hot, sweaty, cringing and nasuated for the weak of stomach. He can really write wonderful scenes! The story is a good read and held my attention but it is disturbing. Don't read it expecting great explanations or pretty nice bows tieing up everything at the end. Still a good read, just don't do as I did and try and eat a tuna sandwhich while reading certain scenes!"
2,Dark and depressing,This book started out a little depressing and went completely downhill. Likely I was not in the mood to read about the tragedies which occur in this novel but I did not enjoy this read.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Another horror novel of the disturbing sort. When a book publisher type discovers a heretofore unknown work by a dead author, he goes to India in search of it.What he uncovers is a whole lot of nastiness associated with the worship of the goddess Kali, and publishing this work would make things even nastier.Pretty much a story of unrelenting and likely unstoppable evil."
5,Calcutta- Hell on Earth,"I loved this book because it totally could happen. I've been there and the way Simmons describes it is almost too kind. It's the bowels of the earth, to be sure. Also, I really believe in this sort of thing...statues coming to life and all that. And when you read what happens to the baby, well, it's not for the squeamish. The people who live there are gross and infested with lice, rats and human feces. Gawd, it's terrible. In the end, the protagonist considers Calcutta in a mushroom cloud and I agree. Some places should just not exist."
3,At Times Brilliant. At Times Boring.,"The Song of Kali was at times brilliant, and at times boring. The story is about a writer for Harper's who heads to Calcutta to research a story on a poet by the name of M. Das. Once there, chaos insues.The first 100 pages were brilliant. I loved the story and couldn't put the book down. Somewhere thereafter, the author lost his focus. The story meanders through near endless line after line about the city of Calcutta, making the story trudge along line a bloated corpse. I could barely finish the last 100 pages. The book had become so filled with tedious description that I found I had little desire left to finish. (Not did I care what happened)This story is not horror. It is ""Literature"", if you catch my drift."
3,A Scary Mystery with an Unhappy Ending,"A journalist is sent off to India to collect a new epic poem written by a famous poet supposedly dead for eight years. Expecting something scary, I was sorely disappointed. Song of Kali is more proof that the judges of the World Fantasy Award just don't have time to read. Granted, the writing is clear and precise; Simmons isn't lacking technical skill. In fact, the book isn't bad, it just can't be called fantasy, and isn't quite horror. So what is it? It's a scary mystery with an unhappy ending."
1,Not What It Proclaims To Be,"I picked up Song of Kali because it was tauted as being a horror novel. It clearly was not. It was a novel about a city with a very seedy and violent nature, but it was not a horror novel. I personally feel robbed that it was advertised as such and obviously wasn't.If you want to read a novel about Calcutta and the underbelly of its society, then by all means read this novel. But, don't expect too much. What little plot there was could be seen coming from miles away. My advice would be to buy a used copy or get it from the library."
3,Just read 100 pages and it's TOO creepy!,"This is book for real horror/splatterpunk fans, not people like me who read fiction or combination of epic fiction and thrillers.Book is set in India, where I have never been and I really don't know if morbid underground cults and human sacrifices described in book exist, but book just sucks you in those unpleasant places and you feel as if you are witness to them.All in all, this book reminds me of Clive Barker's early story 'Midnight meat train' from 'Books of Blood' and is too scary for me!"
2,I expected too much,"I had high expectations about this book, somehow driven by the good reviews.But it didn't took long before I began turning pages thinking ""maybe it's now this is gonna warm up"", just to find out it didn't. And it never did.Except for some curiosities about the indian way of life/culture and the description of Calcuta, the story doesn't have more to hook the reader. I felt disapointed at the end and felt this is a book I wouldn't spend money on if I could turn back time. Consider yourself advised."
4,The City Itself is The Monster,"Suffice to say this book has prompted my first ever Amazon review.I first read Dan Simmons' The Crook Factory after the repeated prompting of a friend. The book grew on me, and years later picked up The Terror, which was thoroughly engrossing, despite an ending that was a bit of a letdown.I was excited to finally grab The Song of Kali on Kindle, and blew through it in a matter of days. Simmons has truly made the streets of Calcutta the villain in this novel, and a people utterly resigned to their plight its victims. The uneasiness Simmons creates through his atmospheric writing grows as the book progresses, and weighs heavily on the reader throughout, reaching its apex at a moment of true shock. Cheers, Dan; I was completely caught off guard and gasped aloud.Intentional or not, Simmons' doesn't tie things up in a bow for the reader. Life is usually like that, which makes The Song of Kali so unsettling."
4,A really good book,"Although not what I would call scary or shocking, this book was very engrossing. It puts you dead-center in Calcutta so that you can almost smell and see what's being described. The writing style is excellent, the characters are entirely believable and the story moves at a perfect pace. It's different - highly recommended."
2,"Great setting, shaky plot","The strength of this book is its stunning power of setting: the misery and festering evil that is this version of Calcutta. The scenes live and breathe and are vicarious fun to drift through - just like a movie.However, the hero is extremely unlikable, constantly exploding like a five year-old prone to tantrums and impulsive behavior. Also, the plot has real credibility problems. Why did the hero take his wife and baby to such an awful place as Calcutta? He knew he was inconveniencing his wife (a math professor who had work to do), and he also knew that she, while Indian, was not steeped in the right culture to serve as an effective interpreter and guide for him.Why? Well, obviously to put them in danger as a clumsy plot device. Ultimately, the plot problems capsize the interest of the setting. I wouldn't recommend this one unless you want to try a library copy first."
4,Very good depiction of urban poverty and spiritual terror,"If you are intersted in this book, DO NOT READ THE REVIEWS BELOW. The reviews below give away MAJOR plot points and ruined my reading of what would have been a suspenseful book."
4,Literate and Disturbing,"...this is hardly the most frightening book ever written. I wouldn't even put it in the top 10. That said, Mr. Simmons has crafted a chilling read. Right from the introduction, I found myself completely seduced by his fictional Calcutta as a den of unspeakable evil. This has stayed with me after reading the book, and I find that I am now drawn to Calcutta in the same way I was drawn to New England after reading H.P. Lovecraft, just to see if it is really that disturbing.The book is extremely enjoyable to read, with an almost literary quality. The author is deft at handling the demands of exposition within the constraints of the first person narration. A few moments ring untrue, but others (including the climax) are just fantastic. Overall the book has the messy feel of a true-life story, which of course makes it all the more disturbing.Highly recommended!"
1,Tedious and silly,"SONG OF KALI is a combination of non-sensical plot choices (ex. the protagonist decides to bring his infant daughter from the US to India on a short business trip; the ""rationale"" given for this is so pathetically feeble, the author might just as well SAY ""so the baby can be placed in danger for plot purposes""), repellant characters (particularly the protagonist, who's foolish, mean-spirited, rude, self-absorbed, racist... 300 pages spent with this jerk felt like a long, LONG time), fantasy/horror elements that don't manage to get off the ground, and storytelling that's heavy-handed and simple-minded. The whole novel comes across as if the author hated Calcutta so much during his brief visit to the city that he felt compelled to glorify his ""ick! ick! ICK!"" reaction by turning that reaction into a one-dimensional novel."
1,"Racism, or just ignorance?","Wow... worst book ever written. It's depiction of one of India's holiest cities and it's inhabitants is deluded at best, and diabolically racist at it's worst. Not to mention how many Hindus (myself included) his depiction of our beloved Goddess, Kali Ma... Hindus definitely don't sacrifice people to Kali... most Hindus are at the very least semi-vegetarians. Disgusting anti-religious sentiment and racist hatred is what summarizes this book best.Jai Sri Kali Mata!"
1,I would give this 0 stars if possible. The worst book I ever read this year.,"I have never read A dan simmons book before, I'm never going to read another book by him. The fact that this won the World Fantasy Award is more disturbing to me than the novel itself. I found the novel really xenophobic and meanly racist. Never going to read any of this racist author again."
1,Not good,"Did not like this calender, did not even use it. I stopped buying game based calenders after this one. go with proven ideas!"
3,Seems expensive for what you get,"Thought this was going to be a decent size (larger) bag. Disappointed in value of product, but otherwise product is fine and as advertised."
3,not what I expected,It was a terrible movie. It wasn't what I expected but the quality of the film was good. I wouldn't recommend watching it.
3,BAD SEED,"Once there was a girl who had a curlRight in the middle of her foreheadWhen she was good, she was very vey goodWhen she was bad, SHE WAS MURDEROUS!Rhoda is charming and manipulative, though why are the adults around her too stupid to see what she is really doing? 'Bad Seed' is a terrific film, though it might put you off having children!A solid 1950's scary movie to be watched late at night."
5,Creepy!,I hate that little girl! Some of those old movies are still creepier than any slasher film made today and this is one of them.
5,A straight out DEVIL,I just love this DVD with this bad girl. I have it on VHS and I just had to get it on DVD. This is a keeper for life. This lil girl ain't no joke. This was a great price and i received it super super fast. Thanks for a good transaction. I will be doing business with you again.
5,The Bad Seed is a great film,"Considering this film was really a fimed version of a stage show, it really is an entertaining peice of 50's film. The acting is great (esp Patty McCormack) The extras which includes an interview with Patty McCormack is a real bonus."
5,Twisted Daughter,"Patty McCormack is THE BAD SEED. This is a twisted and shocking tale. Whatever you do, do not trade a basket full of kisses for as basket full of hugs with Patty McCormack. You may just get more than you bargained for. McCormack gives a chilling and incredibly detached performance as a sweet child whose vividly demented aspirations of obtaining simple possessions of others reap horrific acts on her part.Nancy Kelly as her mom and Eileen Heckart as the mother of one of her victims both give emotionally gripping and heart wrenching performances.Composer Alex North brilliantly put ""Au Claire de la Lune"" to effective use as McCormack played this piece on the piano throughout the film raising the tune to demented proportions. It is totally nerve racking."
5,Thriller fans must buy!,"It did not take any gory special effects or even a change of scenery to make the Bad Seed the chilling and groundbreakinglittle thriller it was.It tells the story of a cute little girl who gets pleasue out of killing people any way she can. The movie's theme was used in later years in The Good Son with Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood which I thought was good, but not like The Bad Seed was.Nancy Keller and Patricia McComack deliver Oscar-worthy peformances in it.I think a lot of today's horror flicks are uninspired and mostly garbage, and so I advise young people like myself to go watch this straight through with the lights turned off."
5,Wonderful horror in a normal setting!,"Nancy Kelly and Patty MacCormack are excellent in The Bad Seed, as is Evelyn Varden! This picture views like a play, but has the qualities necessary to keep you interested and intrigued. Never has such normalcy been viewed so watchable...and cunning to the finish. I wish I'd been able to see it on the stage. Awesome and recommended."
2,Avert Your Ears,"Despite the Oscar nominations and Golden Globe wins, THE BAD SEED has not aged all that well. It was adapted from a Broadway play taken from a best-selling novel that remains largely stage-bound with lots of expository material left to reveal plot and character. The acting honors are well-deserved, especially young Patty McCormack as the murderous brat but Nancy Kelly's raspy whine is hard to take, inevitably reaching a near-howl as the story unfolds. Just when I was ready to hit the 'stop' button, the grieving, drunken mom played marvelously with a tinge of humor by Eileen Heckart showed up--twice--thank goodness. Does anyone see a potential tv sitcom here?"
1,High Definition It Isn't!,"With all the reviews of THE BAD SEED already posted here, it doesn't seem necessary to add any more comments about the film itself. However, if you're thinking of ""upgrading"" your DVD of this movie to Blu-ray, don't bother. The picture quality on this disc, as a previous viewer noted, is substandard for ANY format. All the things you would expect from a good Blu-ray edition, such as finely detailed images and remarkable clarity and contrast, are totally missing with this release. It's also worth noting that the DVD was presented in a standard version, while the Blu-ray is in widescreen 1:85:1. This might seem to be an improvement, but all indications are that the picture area has simply been enlarged to fill the screen. Many scenes seem rather awkwardly framed, with the actors' heads almost cut off at the top. Sad to say it, but I think this was a low-budget rush job to get the disc out in time for Halloween. Very disappointing, to say the least."
5,Great,I've always loved this money and now I can watch it any time I want insead of waiting for it to be on tv
5,The Bad Seed,It was just like I remember! Excellent black and white movie. This movie is timeless and will still capture the attention of generations to come. Timeless writing and storyline. Wonderful DVD quality.
2,The Play's the Thing!,"The stage version of ""The Bad Seed"" was brilliant with an equally brilliant ending.The movie is much too stagey, a bit too Broadwayesque in its presentation, that is, practically filming a stage show with all its limitations, including the stage-acting..a tad pompous. Except for Patty McCormack, the other characters should have been re-cast."
1,ddid not see,Did not have a chance to see it. Your movie did not plamy jpad. customer service did not. pick up phoneI paid for nothingwont ever do this again eill use my netflix
2,Self Torture,"If you have no imagination, and want to suffer intense boredom for a couple of hours, by all means watch this movie. I suppose it might have been the thing in 1956, but now it's drivel. I expect it to show up on Mystery Science Theater 3000 any day now."
3,Doesn't compare to the book....,"This really is a great story, but the film can't begin to compare to the horror of the book. And typical of Hollywood, they had to change a brilliant ending to something pat and hackneyed. I gave the movie 3 stars because of three outstanding performances by Patty McCormack, Eileen Heckart, and Henry Jones. Nancy Kelly is hopelessly miscast as Christine Penmark, who in the book one visualizes as a Lana Turner type. She hyperventilates and overacts throughout the entire movie. And the ending of this film totally destroys the story. If you want a great story, one that will really make you THINK and gasp, read the book......."
3,The concept is still chilling,"and the film watchable, but tough to say more. It seems like LeRoy, as a director, just sat there watching the actors perform the play, and it shows. As many have said, the very best scenes are between Rhoda and Leroy, the handyman. Eileen Heckert is also a standout. McCormick was effective in her role, but it still seemed too stagy at times. The rest of the cast overacts embarassingly, particularly Kelly, who, I'd bet, walked over to the next sound stage on the lot after chewing up all the scenery in her own film. You're about ready for someone to lock her in a soundproof trunk about a third of the way through. And it's definitely difficult to feel one iota of sympathy for the kid whatever. The tacked-on ""Hollywood ending"" is just idiotic; there's nothing wrong with the ending as initially intended. It was one of the best parts of the film."
3,"Flawed, but still fun to watch.","I first saw this movie when I was a child, and remember loving every minute of it.Fast forward 30+ years to last night when I watched it for the first time since my childhood. I was expecting it to be every bit as exciting as it was back then. Wrong! I felt as if I was watching nothing more than a filmed Broadway play. Blame that on the director, and also to many of the over-the-top performances. Mainly it's Nancy Kelly, who wrings her hands, throws herself on the sofa, and overacts all over the place. Patty McCormack, as Rhoda, is still fun to watch. But the movie really comes to life in the scenes between Rhoda, and Leroy (wonderfully played by Henry Jones). If only the entire movie was as good as those few scenes between Leroy and Rhoda!"
5,One of our family favorites,This movie keeps you stuck to your seat until it's finished! The acting and storyline is like none other! I would definately buy this movie!
5,CHILLING!!!,"Another terrific Baby Shower Gift!A must for new parents...Still chilling after all these years.The Bad Seed...She'll warm your heart, then RIP IT OUT!"
5,A spine-tingling movie,The Bad Seed is the only horror movie I'll watch at night because it is the most extreme movie I've ever watched.
5,The Bad Seed,"This was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid. It is just as I remember it, black & white and all."
5,The Bad Seed,The first time I saw this movie I was about 12 years old. I am now 50 and I enjoy this movie as much now as I did so many years ago. Someone made an updated version of this movie however it did not come near the original version. If you are going to get this movie stick with the original version.
4,better than I first thought,"At first I didn't like ""Size""' very well, but after a few listens it started to grow on me . The best cuts are as follows: ""How to fall in Love""-- really catchy tune and different than most Bee Gees songs, despite relying on those famous harmonies. Ditto for ""Anything for you.""""Blue Island"" is really gorgeous. ""Above and Beyond"" is a toe tapper,and ""Fallen Angel"" is impossible to listen to and sit still at the same time. This song more than any caused me to give a listen to ""Size""'enough times to fully appreciate the rest.As already mentioned,the harmonies on this CD are classic Gibb, yet are used in a different way than usual, as are the musical arrangements.Perhaps,""Kiss Of Life"" demonstrates these qualities better than any other cut, and has come to be my favorite. What is different about their sound on ""Size""' is really hard to put into words, so I'll stop trying. Suffice it to say,""Size Isn't Everything"" will not disappoint and deserves a listen----or two."
4,Simply the best of the Bee Gees,"I've been on a long search for this album and when I finally got it, I can't stop listening. I almost listen two to three times a day to this album, almost more than I listen to my ""Still Waters"" or ""One"" or ""E.S.P"" albums. ""Paying The Price Of Love"", ""Kiss Of Life"", ""Haunted House"", ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" and ""Fallen Angel"" are the best. Maurice takes an great lead on ""Omega Man"" and ""Above And Beyond"" and they both rock hard.I would advise any big fan of the Brothers Gibb, to buy this album if you haven't got it yet, because it's really great. Some people say that this is the best album the Bee Gees ever released, that is so true, but ""Still Waters"" I guess are the best."
3,IT WAS GOOD,IT WAS GOOD MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THERE ARE BLUE ISLAND FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS PAYING THE PRICE OF LOVE I DIDN'T LIKE THE OTHER SONGS ON THERE.FROM A LOYAL CARING BEE GEES FAN KIRSTEN
5,Family Values,"Quite interesting songs from the soundtrack, not the mc hammer, hammer!!! ha ha, but easy listenning tunes that we sometimes like in a soundtrack."
4,Hard to rate reality,This is a movie based on true events and true to life the good guys don't always win. When money and power are put on the table even the innocent will be disregarded. I didn't exactly like the way the film was done with little character development but it is a film that's true to reality and that should be respected above all else. These kinds of cases are common amongst disabled children and seeking justice for these kids doesn't always happen. Sometimes they end up even worse than their condition. It's sick that there are those who take advantage of children for their own pleasure but this movie shines a light on to that reality. I do think the film skips a lot of story that could have been written in by the idea of the film is understood.
3,"Not a bad book, but has a few problems","My main problem with this book is that the text looks like a magazine, so often it's difficult to discern what is important versus what is trivial. In addition, in the first chapter the authors present all of the financial statements, which overwhelms some students. Finally, some topics are used before they are intoduced in detail.Nonetheless, the book is excellent in many ways. If you carefully read the text of each chapter, you will get a good background in basic accounting. There are many problems at the end of the chapter, and the online materials are splendid. Use them to you advantage, read the book, and attend your class, and with hard work success is probable."
5,my favorite book,"This book is great for all ages. each time i read it it see it from a different perspective - first as a young woman, then a married woman, then a young mom, now a mom in the midst of having teens, and each time i come to appreciate it more.looking back, reading this book influenced the kind of mother i was. it is an easy read, and interesting.historical, based on real pioneers, a good story.an excellent book. i would recommend it to anyone. in fact i just bought several copies to give away."
5,She left a legacy,"A Lantern in Her Hand is a wonderful account of pioneer life and details about our heritage. I live in Iowa, where the author is from and personally know one of her relatives. Read this book and you will be inspired by those who came before us who gave up so much to establish their states. I especially liked Aldrich's discription of prairie life and ""the way things were""."
5,Lovely Book,"A pioneer lady travels to Nebraska. This is her story from beginning to end - from living in a ""Sodie"" to a nice home. Anyone who is interested in the life of our early pioneers would be interested in this book. It is a peaceful, fulfilling book. No violence or swearing or lewd acts."
5,My favorite book from childhood!,I read this book thirty years ago and can still remember how deeply it affected me. I've read it several times since then and it never loses its magic. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone--young or old.
4,Insights about life that still apply.,Recently had a family reunion in Nebraska to return ashes of a family member. This book was suggested because it would give one a real feel as to what life was like for the early pioneer families.The book was a bit silly at first; but as the young lady matured so did her actions and speech. I ended up enjoying it very much and enjoying the insights about life and family that still apply.
2,Well-worn story about a woman's life..,"Bess Aldrich's ""Lantern in Her Hand"" is about 75 years old now. It tells the story of one woman named Abby Deal, and her life from a young girl to an elderly grandmother. It seems stuck in its time, as Abby acts like an ""old fashioned"" woman, but I suppose I can't expect differently. The story moves slowly, and it tells of how Nebraska became settled. Typical grandmother-granddaughter subplot where they leave in two different worlds, and typical subplot about another granddaughter who is just like Abby."
1,Terrible,"This book had been recommended to me, and it seemed like it would be good when I read the introduction, but after three times of starting and trying to finish this book, I decided it just wasn't worth it. It may have some events that are significant and add to the story with the sense that should go along with them, but somehow, this book bored me and seemed very flat and detached from any real feeling. When I was reading it, I couldn't feel the story and could not relate to Abbie, maybe because few of her feelings were aptly expressed in the story. The only thing I could really feel was the inevitable rushing of time and Abbie's fear of death,who snatches people away. It may be a good book to other people, especially those who can stand to finish it, but it just didn't keep my attention, and I can usually tolerate some slowness in a book."
2,Hopes and Dreams of Girlhood and Life,"This is the story of a young girl who dreamed big dreams and had great hopes of her life. Instead of her life fulfilling her dreams, however, she spent her days baking bread, piecing quilts, and taking care of children. Her children eventually accomplished the great things Abbie had hoped to do, but they seemed to care little for the life Abbie herself had led. It was a disappointing book for me, but it aptly brought to life the hopes and dreams of a young girl, and how real life prevents her from living her dreams. It did inspire me to analyze my dreams, to see if they are realistic, and to consider whether God might have other plans. Good dreams may need to be exchanged for what is best for us."
1,Worst. Book. Ever,"This is the worst book ever, I cannot stand it. Whoa, I don't care if you can use 700 words to describe a sunset, that dosen't make a book good. Unentertaining garbage."
5,MORE RAVENS??,Bernd Heinrich is the master of the study of ravens and crows. He has traveled extensively to capture the real beauty of the woods in Maine and elsewhere. Want to become a naturalist? Read this book!
2,A self-congratulatory ego trip,"Heinrich obviously wants us to think of him as the modern Thoreau, but his thoughts are far shallower and less interesting. Furthermore Thoreau saw no need to ostentatiously parade his specialized knowledge before his readers, as Heinrich does. The specifying of 6 different kinds of warbler calls heard on a particular morning does not add to the atmosphere or enjoyment for almost anyone - but it DOES impress you with how much Heinrich knows about bird calls. Much of the book is in the same vein - paragraph after paragraph written not to instruct or entertain, but to impress. There are better choices out there by writers who are more impressed with their surroundings and less impressed with themselves."
3,It is relaxing to read this book,"This book starts out pretty good but eventually becomes fragmented and seems to lose it's continuity. I grew tired of the non-stop dissertations on plant and animal life. The best parts of the book are when the author is interacting with his own species, but even those stories seemed to go nowhere. I wonder though, if the author became more eccentric after his year in the woods, or if he started out that way."
5,Atomic genius,"After listening to every song at least three times I still could not take this cd out of my player!! Pat Bucanan is a musical talent that exudes nothing but pure genius. His rhythm on guitar is second to none; vocals (all the umbrellas - christina ) on par with the best.. ""Look out world""!! I rate this cd 5 STARS; because this is the type of music I've been looking for! Energetic, upbeat, totally unique with masterful songs written by someone who has listened to their heart; PERIOD! With soulful sounds radiating from Pat's vocals accompanied by zeal, passion and most of all unpolluted spirit. Best yet, Pat has to be one of the greatest guitar players in the world! (Bar None - Evidence: atomic fireball) Where do I sign up to get on the fan list!"
5,great movie about families and relationships,"i really like this movie because i can see where the mom and the teenager is coming from in this movie. it's cute, sweet, and you should see it :0]"
2,Bob Hoskins good actor,"Can't believe I'm writing a review for this movie.Out of all the flicks I reviewed this is probably the oddest of them all.Well Mermaids isn't my kind of movie ,but I can say I seen it.Bob Hoskins is a great actor and has been in films such as , Roger Rabbit , Enemy at the Gates and Unleashed w/ Jet Li.Mermaids is too soft for me to ever watch , I guess I'm trying to say it's for younger females."
5,good video,"I like this video, I got this to replace a VHS of it. this was always one of my favorite movies. right now, yes it is dated, but I do still enjoy the show."
5,Perfect!,"WOW! I was compelled to watch one of the most romantic comedies of all time - ""Mermaids"" starring Cher, Bob Hoskins, Winona Ryder and Christina Ricci. It is wonderful. Funny, romantic, great music, heartwarming and clever. If you've never seen it, don't miss it! It outclasses so many of the tasteless flicks of today."
4,Charming,"This Movie was a wonderful movie with a somewhat realistic view, i think it is worth the money and a great Movie for women everywhere."
5,Excellant portrayal of mother-daughter dynamics,"I, too, could not believe they had stopped production of ""Mermaids"" video. Cher should have received an Oscar for this role, not MoonStruck! The relationship between her and Winona Ryder was very intense. Society would say the two daughters had a disadvantaged childhood, but did they? What tremendous strength Winona shows in her role by being herself and not her mother. This was not a comedy; it was comedic, but mostly a drama of how a family can still be a family, but not an adjusted one. I really want this video for my collection; I've been looking two years!!"
5,Great item and great for cats!,I found these dispensers indispensable. I can't be around all the time and my cat still needs to eat. Also great for long vacations as it makes the cat-sitter's job an every-other day event instead of 2 or 3 times a day. P.S. my cat did NOT get fat from having food around all the time.
4,Happy Cats...........,"Purchased this primarily to feed some feral cats that arrived in my yard...putting a bowl outside daily was getting to be a pain. This set works well, water bottle hasn't produced any mold/mildew so far, and hopefully won't, like a cheap one I bought at Walmart last year. The set is a little smaller than I envisioned it, but a gallon is a gallon and works well. It is a bit pricey, but so far worth it."
4,Shark 12 inch Carpentry Saw,"This saw has changed my views on handsaws. It's easy for a woman to use, inexpensive, not made in China (huge) and cuts easily. I've used mine for many things and am going to order a new blade tohave on hand, as this is now my go-to saw. I dislike power tools, especially saws, so was really, really happy to find a manual saw that works so easily and so well. The only downside I have found is that theplastic knob that holds in the blade loosens up with use. But for the price, I highly recommend this saw."
5,Cuts clean,This lives up to the reviews that I read before purchasing. Pleased. I kept the container and the saw blade guard that it came with and use them religiously for storage.
5,Unbeatable...,This is the second one of these saws I've owned (had the first for 12 years) and it is simply indispensable. Cutting on the pull seems to give me a lot more control and a straighter cut than a traditional handsaw. I use it frequently and it's just a great tool.
5,first handsaw I've ever enjoyed using,"My only memories of hand saws were from using my dad's old 70's era push-cut beast as a kid. It was slow, difficult to control, and laborious. This has completely changed my opinion of hand cutting. It works incredibly fast on cross cuts (don't force it, just let the weight of the blade do the work) and reasonably well on rips (though seemingly a bit slower for some reason).The handle is well designed in that the angle allows you to grip it horizontally (as you would in most circumstances) but also vertically for sawing into a board (teeth away from you) which I used to put notches in a board to make a joint. I've been reaching for it more often than power saws lately because it is quick, fast, less messy and not noisy."
4,Shark Corp 12 Inch Carpentry Saw,"Blade is fantastic. The handle came unscrewed while I was using it and I thought it broke. I simply tightened it. Makes it easy to change blades. Not as ""Solid"" as I thought. With that said it's a very very very sharp blade and cuts through 1 x 3 wood nicely. Have not used it on PVC yet. It's a good product. Made in Japan we like that. Great tool to have. I would buy another."
5,kick-*** album,"If you want the best Dolls album, buy this one. This has almost every single song by the New York Dolls on there, and the sound quality is incredible. It's worth spending money on this bad boy."
4,A nice collection with a few unreleased tracks.,"Rock n' Roll is a nice collection of New York Dolls music.Not only are the tracks remastered but they've included a few unreleased ones as well (Courageous Cat Theme, Lone Star Queen). A cool booklet with a lot of information isincluded with the CD. It's a shame this disc wasn't that wellpublicized when it firsy came out. The disc sold poorly and their only two studio albums have never been digitally remastered. The only thing missing from this collection is the New York Dolls anthem PILLS!Strongly recommended."
5,Can't beat it for the money!,"For a mere $60.99 (nearly $20 less than at Musician's Friend and about half the MSRP) at Amazon.com, this mixer is your best bet. It has the cost of an entry-level mixer without the bleeding and fragile faders, 2-band EQ, and utter lack of scratch features that one normally finds on entry-level mixers. The faders are tough yet sensitive, with no sound bleeding. The 3-band EQ, crossfader-style cuing, and mic EQ add great functionality to this mixer. The hamster switch and crossfader slope are a nice touch if you're ever feeling a bit hip-hop or want to cut up some beats. I was originally going to get a DM950 and just upgrade in a few months, but at this price, why bother? I recommend this mixer to every startup DJ, whether you're aiming for scratch, trance, jungle, Baroque, whatever. This is an excellent mixer that doesn't sacrifice quality, though it definitely won't break the bank. I will definitely continue to buy Numark products!"
3,DM1050,"i got this mixer as a gift, 2 years ago. its a very good entry level mixer, but beyond that, its useless. within 3 days the crossfader began to bleed through, and 4 or 5 days after that it became completely unresponsive. ive had it rebuilt twice only to have the same thing happen within days. ive resorted to using the volume sliders to fade and the line switches to cut, for the past year or so. if you want someone to learn the basics before jumping in to quality equipment by all means buy them this mixer, its the training wheels on the schwinn of DJing. this mixer would be a good mate for some entry level turn tables... but for someone who has been DJing for some time this mixer would be a few steps backwards.JMHO-Grimm"
4,Solid mixer,"I've had this mixer for 5 or 6 years - it's now somewhat outdated but still works great. I originally bought it to practice being a radio dj but since I don't do that now, this mixer has been sitting around collecting dust. I was recently going to sell it until I discovered a cool alternate use for it: I have my Sansa Fuze MP3 player connected to it and MP3's sound quite analog through this mixer, even better and more alive than through my big Sherwood receiver. This thing is great as a headphone amp - I actually forget that I'm listening to compressed music files. Additionally, I've never had any technical issues with this mixer and it's extremely easy to use (no computer involved!)"
4,Great value,"the botton line is that is this is a great value for a mixer. It's my first one, but I've used others. And I have to say, this has great functionality, seems quite durable, and is both functional and simple. For my purposes (just playing records when I DJ - no scratching, etc), it gets the job done. I can't speak to anything outside of that. I like the controls, and the cue fader is great and profoundly simple (something I think is missing from many larger, more expensive mixers).I would say that the one and only drawback is that it does not have XLR or 1/4"" outputs - only RCA, which is a problem some places. But you can always get cables to convert RCA to your preferred format. Also works great w/an iPod and monster cables."
4,These Guys Rock!,"i checked out your power's on cd ,sounds great ,i also have a copy of Chipper Dove's Live cd from NYC. That cd is fantastic it must have been a great show, with the crowd going nuts. keep that good ole rock n roll coming."
3,Does not work with SX66,"I could not rate this item since I have an SX-66 and this tip will not work with that phone.Unfortunately the Amazon page does not mention what Siemens phones this tip works with, so I purchased it and found out the bad news later.I'm sure it works with other Siemens phones well."
1,Not For Real Boxing Fans,"I saw this when it came out in the movie theatres because I'm a big fan of boxing and used to box, light heavy, in my younger days. Hilary Swank as a boxer? Yea, sure. It just didn't cut it with me. Women's boxing is not a serious sport, more like professional wrestling than boxing. This film would have been much better if Clint Eastwood trained a male character. Then you could take it seriously. By the end of the flick, when Clint Eastwood kills Hilary Swank with a lethal injection because she is paralyzed and want's to die, it gave mercy killing a new meaning. Mercy of the viewer for bringing this joke of a movie to an end and letting us out of the theatre. I doubt the people giving this flick good ratings know much about boxing."
2,Overhyped Hollywood Schmaltz,"Am I the only person who misses the days when Clint Eastwood made real movies? While his whole career from an artistic sense has been pure downhill since The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly, Million Dollar Baby marks a new low point for the former macho man. A three disc special edition for this slop? Who are they kidding? Do they think this is The Battle of Algiers?The sad fact is that while the quality of world filmmaking continues to increase, Hollywood films continue to get worse and worse, stifled by corporate and union bureaucracies and a total lack of original thought. Million Dollar Baby was not even one of the ten best films of 2004, but it earned the best pic prize because the Oscars are not so much a measure of artistic merit as they are a shameless self-promotion vehicle. It hasn't been this bad since the 1960s, when dreadful flics like Tom Jones and Oliver won the big prize."
2,Why Are Full Screen DVD's Even Made???,"O.K., I have not seen this movie yet but will plunk down by hard earned bucks as soon as it's released on the 12th of July. What I don't get is, are there people out there that buy full screen DVD's or worse, prefer them?! Why do you want to watch a cropped off version of the movie? I don't get it, you might as well stick to Video tape which made the huge, ripping off the public, mistake of turning out 95% of the factory tapes in pan and scan. Wake up folks, buy the real version of the movie. Make thes inferior versions go away. Wide screen will get five stars, hear this movie is awesome."
1,The best movie I've ever seen...,"And that is saying a lot...because I consider myself to be a lover of movies...This ranks right alongside if not above Braveheart, The Godfather, and E.T. I can't say it is the movie I liked the most...but it is SO well acted...so well directed...and the story, although seemingly contrived worked for me. Swank has proved that she is in a class all by herself, with her second Oscar and quite possibly the best female performance I can EVER remember...it is the subtleties of her portrayal that makes this performance work... I was wondering if my assessment of this flick was way off, so I started surfing reviews...and for once,"
3,James C. Duckett hits the nail on the head,"I have been struggling with the reason why this movie left me so deflated (except for the obvious ones) and Mr. Duckett hit it on the head....Maggie completely goes against her nature in her final request. That was what bothered me so about it. Aside from that, the acting was phenomenal by all three of the leads, and it is well worth your time to see, even if only the first two thirds of it are satisfying."
5,Great!!!,"The beginning comes across very slow...a very powerful, emotional movie. Clint Eastwood is the best...no one will ever be able to replace such a wonderful actor/producer. I look forward to seeing more work of his. I was not prepared for this movie to be so emotional...I cried!!!Great movie to see!!!"
3,"""The Aviator"" got screwed.","That's right. This is one of the best boxing movies of our decade--this and ""The fighter""--however Marty Scorces's epic about the extraordinary and bizarre life of Howard Hughes was far more interesting that this mediative story about perseverance and self-determitism.Eastwood has proven himself one of the most competent naturalistic directors of our time. However, the deck was stacked too deeply against Maggie's family.The controversial ending was handled believably, and Eastwood provided commentary on Swank's options."
2,Pretentious and Sentimental,"A friend asked me recently if I liked boxing movies, and was surprised when I said yes. But this isn't a boxing movie. It's an ode to Clint Eastwood's self-image. Clint is a great comic actor; he's funny whether he's getting beaten or beating some poor fool to a pulp. In this droning fraud, he does neither. Instead he quotes the poetry of William Butler Yeats. I like poetry and I like boxing, but this is just pretentiousness on the part of an aging actor who has begun to take himself too seriously as a tough guy. Equally pretentious is the performance of Morgan Freeman as God... (or was that another movie...?). In fact the only quality bit in Million Dollar Baby is the performance of Hillary swank, which is almost good enough to save the project. To class this sentimental escape with such great boxing movies as Raging Bull or Cinderella Man is a disgrace and an outrage."
5,Five stars all the way!,"I did not want to watch this movie or care for boxingbut ""hubby"" did. He watches movies I like so I joined him to watch. I am so glad I did. I have always been a Clint fan since Rawhide days, he is so laid back and that makes him sexy. I think Morgan is a great actor, so natural. Hilary is just outstanding amd what hard work. Great and moving movie"
3,Cinderella man is a far better boxing movie,"Moderate amounts of action + weepy ending = decent ""date"" movie. ""Unforgiven"" was Clint's masterpiece as a ""Clint Eastwood"" movie. In MDB, his role could have been played any of hundreds of character actors. In MDB, you just keep looking for Clint's revolver or orangatang. Clint was just way too intrusive, and he reduced MDB to a ""Clint Eastwood"" movie. Too much ego, not enough workmanship.Morgan Freedman's narration was good but very distracting, making me look for penguins or characters from other movies he has narrated. Plus narration just seems completely redundant in a movie that should be driven by character rather than exposition.Editing was OK, cinematography flat, fight scenes uninspired, a good number of loose ends in the plot.The really sad thing was that this Academy Award was clearly a ""gimme"" for Clint based on his entire career. But then he went on to do far superior movies like ""Letters From Iwo Jima,"" which was not going to win after MDB."
2,Very predictable- May contain spoilers,"This film had its moments, but mostly, it was predictable and very unrealistic. What happened to her in the ring during her last fight is illegal and there is absolutetly no way in hell they would allow the other fighter to win that fight, as was mentioned by the white trash mother. I watch boxing and I was appalled at that scene. It pretty much ruined the movie for me from that point on. It could have been a good movie but instead it chose to go cliche."
5,Sublime moviemaking,"Having just seen Million Dollar Baby, I have now seen all of the 2005 Best Picture Oscar Nominees. Suffice to say, it ranks right up there with Sideways, Ray, The Aviator, & Finding Neverland. The acting and directing are nothing short of superb, if not second to none. Morgan Freeman should be, in my opinion, a shoe-in for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his stellar work in this one. Hilary Swank, while facing somewhat stiffer competition, should win as well for her intrepid performance as Maggie Fitzgerald, an indomitable and prodigious performance that leaves little to be desired.Eastwood was simply extraordinary in his directing and acting roles as well, although I feel Jamie Foxx is undoubtedly more deserving of the Best Actor award. Million Dollar Baby asserts itself as a powerful moviegoing experience quite unlike any other that you will most likely see for some time to come. In summation, run don't walk to this one."
4,Review,The movie came in excellent condition. The acting was great. Definitely worthy of winning best picture in 2004. Love the actors in it.
4,First part very good but second not so,"This film has two parts which have different qualities. In the first part there is the excellent account of a young woman boxer who wants to become a champion and is looking for a fine trainer to teach her. After much hesitation, Frankie (Clint Eastwood) accepts to be her mentor and her talent and stubborness coupled with fine coaching lead her to the top class of women's box. The second part is about the sensitive issue of euthanasia and although Eastwood tries his best the film can not be compared to the Spanish The Sea Inside which is head and soulders above it in terms of realism, acting and emotional weight."
2,"Brilliant Movie, Terrible DVD","For a film with 3 different releases (2-disc wide, 2-disc full, and 2-disk+soundtrack digipack) its bizarre and unfortunate they are such sub-par releases. The 2-discs come with a very basic outer clamshell package, no chapter list insert is included, no outer cardboard sleeve is included, and only 3 extra features (That are interesting, but did it really need 2 discs?) and comes with NO commentaries. On top of that the DVD has a very poor animorphic wide screen transfer (come on WB this is a huge release, you couldn't get it right?). Its too bad really, because this is a truly amazing film that deserved an amazing DVD."
3,"Good until the end, but very depressing and sad","This was a good movie up until the end. When Maggie went to see her mom and sister after buying her mom a house, the movie got too dark and depressing.I like Clint Eastwood, and this was a great performance by him (and all the other stars in the movie), but the movie itself wasn't the best.I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but I wish they'd make some sort of ""alternate ending"" where you don't have to go through all the melancholy."
3,Just Okay,"Alright, so I know I am going to be slammed for this... but for some reason, I could not get into this movie nearly as much as other reviewers. I was very excited to see this, given the concept. It certainly is a powerful story, and the acting is above par, but for some reason this movie just didn't ""click"". One of the large issues is pacing - things tend to drag. Some of the dialogue seems a little forced. In conclusion, certainly worth a rental, but I was underwhelmed."
3,Decent-mostly,"First a rant-the only reason I watched this was because I thought I had the HD-DVD version from Netflix, but they sent the plain DVD. Anyway, the story was mostly entertaining, although I was dangerously close to boredom several times. I loved Clint Eastwood in his Dirty Harry movies, but in this movie his gravelly monotone voice drove me nuts. Hilary Swank was hotter than I remembered and Morgan Freeman is always solid. The two halves of this movie are very disjointed to the point of being surreal. 15 minutes should have been trimmed from the film to make a tighter, more compelling presentation."
1,million dollar baby,"I was very disappointed,when the dvd arrived I had paid extra to get it in a hurry so my terminally ill father in law could enjoy it for christmas but firstly, the dvd box arrived damaged with no time to send for a replacement then it wouldn't play! And of course once you open it you're stuck with it so all $36 was wasted & my father in law was so disappointed. The only good thing was it arrived on time but I had paid for that. was obvious another box had been resting on my order to cause the damage. Pity not sure if I'd order dvd again."
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Yes, pretty good acting and excellent fight scenes but it looked like something that would have happened 100 years ago. That is, of course, if women were fighting then. The whole idea of a ""dirty fighter"" hitting someone after the bell rings is an anachronism. Hillary and Morgan were OK but Clint should hang it up. Either that, or he should go back to Dirty Harry movies."
3,What is the story?,"Frankly, this movie has no story, unless one considers life's tragedies to be little more than a prelude to giving up and death. So what? Anyone can give up; many, maybe even most people, do when confronted with major setbacks in life. What is the story in that? If Maggie had fought her way to the top in boxing, then used her celebrity and knowledge to help disadvantaged kids . . . that would be a story. If, after being paralyzed, Maggie was shown going through the fear, depression, anger, etc. that comes with such an injury, then finding new meaning in her life when what had been her whole former life had been destroyed . . . that would be a story. What story is there in a cowardly coach that criminally kills her and then disappears . . . especially after seeing his priest then knowingly defying the Church?The best I can say is that this is a movie that never reaches its potential. It doesn't even make a passable case for euthanasia."
3,Mixed feelings,"I had decidedly mixed feelings about this movie. First of all, my expectations were high since this was an Academy Award-winning film. It started out like many sports movies with a young, unknown athlete (in this case Hillary Swank) who decides that her whole life will be dedicated to winning a championship in her sport. Her mentor (Clint Eastwood) is a crusty old curmudgeon who keeps telling her that he doesn't coach girls. When his best fighter leaves him, however, he finds himself with time on his hands and frustration in his heart, and he agrees to train her. I did not expect the dark turn that the movie takes and I'm not sure what point is being made by the crisis situation. On the positive side, the characters are real and believable. It is the situations in which they find themselves that strains credibility. Morgan Freeman is still able to put his indelible stamp on any movie in which he appears, and I was grateful for his soothing presence amidst the tragedy of the film."
2,no suspenson of disbelief,"There is not a single important issue in this plot that could have moved forward without the writer and director making impossibly false choices. Maggie's progress , especially in light of her background; the incredible rule breaking in the championship match that go almost unmentioned; the results of the match, (vaguely referred to), that would actually be the exact opposite; are just few of the items that will be absurd to discerning viewers. Even looking at this as a fantasy, (which reviewers don't seem to be doing), there is no way to accept so much that would never have occurred in the real world. Fantastic situations must be accompanied by believeable explanations. This film uses no explanation, but rather more fantasy, to explain."
5,HD-DVD is crystal clear,"I saw this one in the theater, then bought the standard DVD. Now that I own the HD-DVD edition, it's like being back in the theater. Faces are very sharp and clear, sweat glistens with reality and the entire journey, much of it in shadows, has a much greater feel of realism thanks to the HD presentation. Warner Home Video hits it out of the park again."
5,Worth much more than a Million Dollars without adjusting for inflation,"Philosophical without being preachy. Teaches without making an effort to teach. Brilliant movie. Each dialogue is a quotation to cherish. The emotions are so universal, cutting across cultures, nationalities, classes. The incidents so easily relatable. The fears so readily recognisable. The lonliness, the betrayals, the politics so human that one can not blame anyone nor can one forgive anyone. What a brilliant movie - what pity that I am watching it decades after it was released."
3,Way Overrated,"I'm starting to take the oscars as a stamp of approval for people who aren't into movies. This movie has absolutely nothing special to offer. Its basically a lesson in competent movie making. Everything about it is cliche and competent, but nothing close to artistic.The movie is well paced, and the overall story is acceptable, but its so predictable and trite that most people are wasting their time. The characters are all one dimensional: stubborn old manager; pure-hearted, hard-working girl; simple, honest retired boxer.There's also such a contrived ""right to die"" issue involved that it starts to feel like propoganda (and I'm even on the side that Clint appears to be on).So: not a complete waste of time, but very typical, predictable and flat."
3,Very Overrated movie - 2.5 Stars,"This movie was so hyped and overrated and when I saw it it was not this super amazing movie that people described. Please, don't give this movie 5 stars...it is simply NOT that good! It's a decent movie however."
2,"Good until the end, then very depressing","We figured someone would die in this film (an old timer or something), but didn't expect what we got.It's extemely depressing. My husband commented that the people who recommended the film to him must not have ever experienced real suffering in their own lives, as he has and prefers not to watch on screen. I said, as a parent, I hate these kind of endings. I don't want all lollypops and flowers, but this was too much.I don't have lots of time to watch movies. Wished I'd skipped this one."
3,Much too depressing,"This film has a lot of strengths to it. Good acting, some good turns of the plot, some characters to care about. But it is really just too damn depressing at the end. What's going on? We start out with a good action movie, a sports triumph. How did we get from there to ""Gee, I hope someone kills off the main character soon"".All I can say is - What were you thinking? Why did you take this film in that direction? Why exploit that particular emotion? A film is a work of art, and just like any other work of art, it is free to go where it chooses. Why did this one go to the depths of depression? Do I really have to follow you there?Gee. Pass the popcorn. What is this, Ibsen?Greatness and depression are not synonyms. Reminds me of the Saty Nite Live skits of Mr. Bill. Oh nooooooooooooo. Uh oh, we'll have to cut off your leg now. Oh Nooooooooooo. Uh oh, we'll have to cut off your tongue now. Oh nooooooooooooooo. Uh oh, we'll have to kill you now. Oh nooooooooooooooooooo."
2,Great acting/cinematography but horribly depressing,"The acting in this movie is of course superb, as expected with such a great cast. The directing/cinematography was also compelling and very well-done. However, the depressing turn that this movie takes I feel took away from these virtues and did not add to the quality of storyline or emotion involved as it did in ""Boys Don't Cry"" (I've seen ""Boys Don't Cry"" several times, but would not watch ""Million Dollar Baby"" again). This is why I gave this movie only 2 stars."
4,Only a TKO,"I gave this movie 4 stars because I enjoyed the stars. Eastwood is not only a great actor, but a wonderful director. Morgan Freeman gives everything he has in a film. Hillary Swank I've seen on occasions, but I have to say she did a great job.The only problem I had with this film was the final fight scene for the championship. When Maggie was knocked down (on a foul) by Blue Bear, the whole thing came to a screaching hault. It was like watching a superbowl and all of a sudden everything stops and no one is told why. If Maggie were to be hospitalized and 'nearly' dies, that would have been a great ending. Her comeback to beat the bear. As it was, I just saw too many holes in the story. You can't just kill someone with a massive does of adrenline and walk out of the hospital. The bear would have been disqualified had she punched someone who was already down.Still, I enjoyed the movie all the way to that point. I'd like to see a remake and the ending done the right way. How about it Clint?"
3,Good and bad,"What I can recommend about this film is the acting of Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman who give Oscar worthy performances. They carry this film alone. But, Clint's lack of acting skills was noticable when paired up with Morgan and Hillary... A lot of one-dimensional characters like the mentally challenged guy in the gym, the cocky female boxing champ, and the greedy family, didn't pull me into the story as it should have. Biggest disappointment was the ending (the plot twist), which could have been done in one-fourth the time, as opposed to the draggy way it resolved."
2,Lame at best!,"Eastwood performance reminds of the mummy. The whole story is performed in a slow and untouching way (I had no feeling for the characters). Do you want to see the pinnacle in boxing movies? the Rocky series is the one to go, nothing even comes close."
1,Worst Move I Ever Saw,"Despite the fact that Hillary Swank is a beautiful, super-talented actress, this movie was the worst I have ever seen. I say this because of the terrible evil that it is clearly trying to promote, namely the murder of anybody who is physically handicapped in some way. The mind of the character played by Hillary Swank was completely intact, yet instead of taking loving care of her, Clint Eastwood took advantage of her physical helplessness by murdering her. This is left-wing propaganda at its most shameful."
2,What A Waste!,"I don't recomend this movie. And although the acting is very good (the 2 stars), the story is troubleing. Admittedly, I'm a ""happy ending"" kind of guy, but there was nothing redeeeming about the way this movie ends. Are we to believe that we are no different than pets being put to sleep at the local shelter? Dunn suffers no consequences for his actions in ending Maggie's life nor does the boxer who broke her neck. Maggie's battles accomplished nothing beyond scars, broken bones and in the end, a broken neck. So much time is devoted to Dunn's broken relationship with his daughter, but we never learn why the relationship was estranged. Like another Academy Winner ""American Beauty"", this DVD went from the player straight to the garbage can. What a waste! I think I will watch Shawshank Redemption again. Now there's a movie!"
1,Dehumanizing.....,"This movie blatantly equates man to the level of an animal (a dog to be specific). Instead of emphasizing the fact that man as a person is important and valuable as a creation of God, man is reduced to the level of animal, without a soul. In the movie Clint Eastwood, despite his CLAIMED Catholic faith, decides to murder the boxer that he trained, in the name of being humane. The very purpose of this movie is appalling."
1,GIrl Power!,"When I think of this movie I think of the proccess of Vomiting. FIrst You take in the food, in this case two over-used plot devices: First, Girls proving they can be just as tough as the guy, second, traning really hard to become a success at whatever stupid sport imaginable. Second Your stomach combines the two pieces of food into one consistincy and then finally you puke this combination on to the floor.Why did this win the Oscar for Best Picture? My only guess is that in this particular regurgitation had some good acting and directing in it. It is still nothing more than another vomit stain on the living room of the biggest vomit producing machine in the world: hollywood"
1,Totally over rated - lack of storyline - massive lack of realisism,"How did this film ever win any awards !Sentimental chick flick.A per previous reviews ""Champ"" did the sentimental boxer movie so much better (if that's your thing)Hilary Swank is totally unconvincing as a boxer - i wonder if she even spent a couple of days training for this movie. Sorry but compare that the Will Smiths preparation for Ali (not a great film either but at least it was possible to believe that he could at least fight his way out of a paper bag)The actual fight scenes are nonsense. That even goes for the corner work - check out the dry sponge as clint carefully dabs it over her face - probably in fear of smudging her makeupA waste of 2 hours"
2,Tough to take,"It was beautifully acted by Hillary Swank, and had a few exciting boxing moments, but, this was the most depressing movie I've ever seen and I really walked out of the theater feeling terribly down and regretful I'd seen it. This movie shows life being so cruel to its lead characters it just seemed out of balance to me. Especially because the whole beginning of the movie seems to be calling for an eventual relief from all the hardship. Unfortunately, It begins close to the bottom and takes you lower. It is a well acted and directed movie, though, so if you can take this sort sad subject matter, it might be worth a look."
4,"Sad, sad, very sad","I did not leave the theater totally depressed. I knew I had seen a very well made movie. As good an actor as Clint Eastwood has become he has mastered the other side of the camera also. He just doesn't make bad movies. I don't see Hillary Swank as a movie star, just a damn fine actress. One of the best. What can you say about Morgan Freeman? He just gives great narration. I put off seeing this movie because of the subject matter. Not only another boxing movie, but girl boxing. I'd be hard pressed to think of a more misbegotten sport. No matter. Boxing's not the point, (it rarely is) it's merely the vehicle. I felt the movie was about pursuing dreams, & facilatating the dreams of others when you can. It's about taking chances, opening youself up to different options, the ability to adapt & change. A solid four."
4,Kept me wondering,"Geeze this was a good movie, but I wish they would have let us know what happened to the evil German prostitute/boxer. Kind of left me feeling empty on that one big point."
5,Another Mystic River,"If you like Mystic River you will love this Picture, It gets your heart beat up/it makes you laugh/it make you cry.My wife and I see 35 to 40 films a year, this is in the top 10 all time great films,"
1,Propoganda anyone?,THis movie is nothing but pro-euthanasia propoganda. Anyone with a serious disability should be angry. I will never watch another movie directed by Eastwood or starring Hillary Swank.
1,Yech...,"...cliche-ridden tripe. I love Clint, but this one really didn't do anything for me. I saw every plot twist coming a mile away. I like Hilary Swank, but this character was also a big cliche and not worthy of her talent. Ditto Morgan Freeman. Sorry, Clint, not a winner in my book. Better luck next time.For a GREAT film on the same topic, try ""The Sea Inside""."
2,What's so great about Hilary Swank?,"Million Dollar Baby is slow, boring, and not worth Oscar gold. Hilary Swank is not that good of an actress, I find her unbearable to watch. Morgan Freeman always seems to play the same character but to my surprise Clint Eastwood is quite good in this film, his acting has never been better. The story and pace of the film is what leaves me disappointed. I just couldn't get into this weeper, oh well."
2,**contains spoilers**,"You know, at the price of movies, it's cheaper to buy the DVD. So I buy the DVD, no problem. But be honest about what I'm getting. I thought I was buying some movie about an against-all-odds underdog woman boxer, not a political statement on euthanasia. And it is so preposterous that Swank's character (This role just reconfirms Swank is a man.) has fought & persisited & trained for all this time & then pow accident decides she will opt for dead in like 15 minutes. If I'm supposed to believe her character up until then, I believe her character would want to prove the doctors wrong & fight to walk & even box again. Please, this sucks. Eastwood, don't veil your statements with a boxing movie. Just retire already. The only thing right about it (& I say this about many movies) is having Morgan Freeman on the cast list."
5,A jewel of movie,"This movie is amazing, I mean you can't miss this one, it is superb acted,it's so beautiful, the Academy didn't get wrong to give 4 oscars to this one, it inspires you, it's so powerful, you'regonna love it, I can assure you that."
4,A touching story.,'Million Dollar Baby' is a simple story of a woman boxer rising up through the ranks in the sleazy boxing world. It has fine performances by all the leading actors. It is a very touching story that will bring tears to the eyes of many people.
4,Nice Work,"Very nice film and Clint Eastwood's best work. Noteworthy performances by both Swank and Freeman earned them their most deserved Oscars; however, I'm not so sure about Best Picture. I still think Ray should have been the winner on that.Nonetheless, the performances in this movie were well done without being overdramatic. I found the trailer trash relatives to be a bit too caricature, but the intimate ""father-daughter"" like moments between Swank and Eastwood were very touching without being overdone.Worthwhile movie and Eastwood's best."
5,Swank!!,Hillary gives the awsome performance with her small town southern ways-but it cant hide her beauty. Is Morgan in every movie? He's great as always. The movie is a must have and deserved the best picture it recieved. A tear jerker at a couple parts and a delight overall
5,If only they were all this good...,"The tale itself is pretty simple, but a well-written script and a group of incredibly gifted actors move this from what could have been melodrama to something special.While it looks initially like a ""boxing movie,"" it obviously becomes more than that. You've got 3 characters, each with their own somewhat tortured past, all searching for something. The magic of this film comes when they join forces, so to speak, to try to attain a shared goal.Hilary Swank is more than deserving of the Oscar she won for her role, as is Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood could have easily taken that honor, too. The interplay between Eastwood and Freeman is so natural that it hardly feels like acting, and the same goes for his scenes with Hilary Swank.Fantastic film, one that everyone should see."
4,"Predictable, but uplifting","Eastwood's gritty-looking boxing film Million Dollar Baby may not pass the smell test when it comes to believability in some parts, but on the whole the messages and the heart of the film are in the right place . You can make up your own minds as to whether the mercy killing at the end is moral, but I wouldn't focus too hard on that. Take with you instead that spirit and drive are what makes life worth living, and that winners only do what losers won't. Well worth your time if you aren't too cynical about moviegoing."
4,Swank and Eastwood Are Amazing!!!,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film that has been getting rave reviews, so i decided to go see it. The first twenty minutes or so seemed like it was going to drag on (THAT'S THE REASON I'M ONLY GIVING IT FOUR INSTEAD OF FIVE), but soon afterwards the film was amazing. It was a touching phenomenon that was brilliantly filmed, written, and acted. Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood, along with co-star Morgan Freeman, are brilliant, and the ending of the film is touching and riveting. GO see it now!!!"
3,Lifetime Movie of the Week Disguising as a Movie Masterpiece,"This movie is beautifully acted, and the conviction of the acting hides the fact that this is a movie that ends in a sentimental way that is just not believable. I won't talk about the last third of the movie, but I will say this movie is full of stereotypes and cliches and somehow hoodwinked movie critics into thinking it was a masterpiece. I love how often the Academy awards mediocrity. Well, at least this film wasn't blatantly overacted like Eastwood's Mystic River.I can't believe how one month of media hype could lead the Acdemy voters into awarding this film a Best Picture award. But what should I expect from the Oscars? How many great movies have not won Best Picture Oscars? Too many to list here.One more thing--besides not being a very original drama, it's also not a very good movie about boxing."
2,"A Depressing ,Disappointing Movie !!!!","With all the Murder Madness and Mayhem in the News I cannot help but believe we have become so De-sensitized ....that a Movie like this would be receiving Rave reviews and talk of Major Accolades !!! !!!THE EMPEROR IS NAKED ...what is wrong with everyone, this movie is so outrageously unbelievable ...I respect Clint Eastwood and I admire Morgan freemans work as a actor but this Movie is utter Rubbish !!!..There are some places in our Souls that are reserved for the most damaging effects on our senses ..a place that we can retreat too in times of absolute unexplainable Madness ..but that is in REALITY I do not need to be taken there by a Movie ...after all ladies and gentlemen this is a ILLUSION a Story being read to us visually by the director with a cast of Characters ..if we ever reach the point in our minds eye that we cannot differenciate between what real and whats a illusion then we are really on a downword slide ."
1,smash mouth boredom,"A very dark, but curiously shallow movie. (Why do we often think that movies depicting broken lives and terrible pain are deep?) Story line: White trash girl who wants to box talks old trainer into working with her. First good things happen, then bad things happen. I kept watching, thinking that soon I would begin to like one of the characters and be drawn into the story. Didn't happen. Beyond learning a little bit about boxing and the boxing world, this movie was a waste of time. And I usually like Clint Eastwood....."
1,One star for the acting,"This could have been such a terrific, uplifting movie. Good actors, potentially great story. I was expecting a Rocky. Instead it's just a cheap endorsement for mercy killing of the severely handicapped. And, no, I am not a right-wing evangelist type. I am a liberal with a conscience."
4,Old Fashioned Romance,"Let's hear it for a great ""feel-good"" movie! Obviously not the type of flick that garners kudos from the critics or at the Oscars (not brooding or avant garde at all). However, the chemistry between the characters played by Moira Kelly and D.B. Sweeney is a treat to behold. This is definitely a wonderful example of the basic ""Old Fashioned Romance"" genre of movies that builds its characters sufficiently to be believable, has characters that you come to like as the story progresses, centers on a relationship that evolves from animosity to love, and ultimately has an ending that leaves you feeling good. Similar in some aspects to the Anne Heche/Harrison Ford vehicle ""6 Days and 7 Nights"", Cutting Edge delivers more warmth and ultimately can bring a tear to your eye at the climax even though you know how it is going to end long before it does. Definitely a ""Saturday night with your date, some wine, and a bowl of popcorn"" classic."
4,You can't turn this movie off. It's hypnotic.,This movie has the right blend of smart ass remarks and story to keep you going. It's hard to turn it off. It's like Heart and Souls or Off Beat. It's one of those movies that a lot of people haven't heard of but should. Corny??? Yes. Cheesy at times???? Of course. Guilty pleasure??? Absolutely.Dig it.
5,"A classic, great duo.","This is a movie we watch at least twice a year.....we love the one liners. This is one of our favorites.....we lent it out and never got it back, so I am replacing it."
5,awesome,I loved this movie. It was awesome. Its the frist in a set of three. The story is beautiful. It shows triumph over both personal and physical tribulations. And the loves story was beautiful. The stars were perfect for their parts. Cast well done. This is just and over all perfect movie.
4,Best Ice Skating movie by non-skaters ever,"D. B. Sweeney is a good straight man for Kelly, but this is Moira Kelly's film, and she knocks it out of the park as the spoiled brat trying to win Olympic Gold for her father. The editing is excellent to keep us unaware (most of the time) that these are not ice skaters, but actors pretending to be ice skaters.In the standard formula movie where the boy and girl start off hating each other and end up loving each other, this is much better than most, because of the strong performances by Kelly and Sweeney, and by a very strong supporting cast. A bit hokey at times, but still a very enjoyable movie."
2,Not good,"I'm female and didn't like this movie. I was expecting lots of ice skating stunts, but there weren't many. Most of the movie focused on the ""love"" story between the two main characters. ""Love"" is in quotation marks because it was not a believeable love story: the two characters were very different and neither was likeable. The female's sudden, inexplicable transformation from nasty to sweet is likewise unbelieveable (but predictable). Additionally, the movie was full of unappealing cliches: the female constantly nagging the hapless male, random women fawning all over the male (even though he's nothing to write home about), tough guy getting in touch with his sensitive ""inner self,"" and on and on. I don't recommend it."
2,Not a Family Movie,"This movie has many scenes where the leading man is in and out if bed with numerous women. It also has a fair amount of swearing. These things ruin a movie for family viewing. I was expecting a clean, romantic story."
2,Objectionable in Part,"The original Cutting Edge is a well cast, and entertaining movie. But the language used in places is inexcusable. I can handle, but don't like the occasional cuss word, (which, speech being the index of the mind, is the usual way low class people express themselves). Be that as it may, I absolutely detest hearing the name of God used loosely or in cursing. It adds nothing to a movie, but subtracts from it. Such blasphemy is comfortable only to people who are perishing, and devils.Joe Brenner"
2,A Disappointment,"Having done figure skating for many years of my life, I was looking forward to seeing a movie about the sport, but this one definitely failed to deliver. When it origianlly premiered in the movie theaters back in 1992, I was 12 and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread, so about 10 years later I decided to buy it on DVD. That was definitely a mistake! This movie lacks a lot of the sophistication that an adult viewer may appreciate. After seeing it again as an adult I realize how unrealistic, over dramatic and predictable this film is. I mean to start with, how and why did an Olympic level pairs skater become partners with an injured hockey player to begin with? In real life that would obviously never happen. The movie has a few funny moments, however it's very cheezy. Truly a disappointment. If you insist on seeing this movie, I would highly recommend renting it first."
1,TERRIBLE movie,"I REALLY wanted to like this movie but didn't. It was terrible.I do not see how hte characters could fall in love. She was a total heartless *itch the whole movie. He wasn't that good himself.I lvoe figure skating, but the movie is not good at all. They focus on the ""love"" story for most of the movie- what love story? The ending was not any good either.This is the worst movie I have seen in a while. If I could I would give it no stars, but htat is not possible. I am so glad my college was playing on our movie channel. I would definitly want my money back if I had rented it.and yes- I am a girl who loves chick flicks, but this movie is terrible!STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE! FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!"
1,"Boring, and a bad influence, considering its PG","The alchohol scene had no place at all in a PG movie. Some underaged friends of mine intentionally mimicked the lemon-drop shooters scene, to a degree that almost lead to the death of one of them. The movie is boring, predictable, and irritating. Both Moira's character and her trainer have got to go.The Redwings had the right idea but rejecting the character, played by DB Sweeney in the movie. We all should have rejected the entire movie."
2,"DVD THE CUTTING EDGE, not working correctly",I am having a problem with this movie. When it is playing the sound and the actors voices don't match. How would I go about sending it back and replacing it
4,Angry Chemistry,"I remember enjoying this film back when I first saw it, over 10 years ago. I hadn't rewatched it in quite a few years, but just decided to do so tonight. Sometimes movies aren't as good as I remember, but this one is. If you're the type of person who reads romance novels & loves that angry chemistry that some characters have, you'll probably be into this. The movie is about a figure skater who tries to make her comeback with an ex-hockey player (D.B. Sweeney). Plus Sweeney's character is also that red blooded sort of man who's more into sports & beer than literature & wine. The young woman is rich & spoiled, but also emotionally bruised & lonely. This is a PG movie, so don't expect any flesh. But do expect heat. Such as heated gazes. There probably isn't enough actual ice skating for big fans of ice skating, but it's enough for the casual viewer."
4,A guilty pleasure,"I hate to admit it, but I love this movie. It's perfect lazy viewing material--cute guy, bitchy girl, both attracted to each other combined with the bitchy, competitive, graceful world of competitive ice skating. The Olympic setting still resonates today, and the politically-fraught relationships between skaters rings true given all that we've seen go on in the real world. I love D.B. Sweeney in this flick (how can you not), and Moira Kelly is beautiful, flawed, and tough in an endearingly prickly way. This is a great rainy day flick."
5,Romantic and entertaining!,"A great romantic, feel good movie! My husband really loves this movie, too! Before watching this movie,the men might think it is too much of a ""chick-flick"", but they may be pleasantly surprised. Very funny and fast-paced. Good for the whole family."
4,Nice.,"Normally, I cannot even tolerate cute, funny, romantic movies. I had no idea that I would get hooked on The Cutting Edge. I feel it's different than most generic ""chick flicks"" in that it actually has plot....it was not predictable or boring in any way. I would especially like to mention Moira Kelly's performance; she plays the part of a wealthy ice-skater perfectly. Sadly enough, this movie is not for everyone. In order to enjoy it, the viewer should have an avid interest in figure skating, and of course be in the mood for a romantic film. But all in all, The Cutting Edge is a good movie."
4,"A ""must have"" for skating fans!","This is a movie that every skating fan (virutally) knows and loves. It's not the most accuarte portrayl of figure skating ... there has yet to be a skating movie made that IS and accurate portrayal of figure skating. But, it's fun and romantic and sweet and well acted. It's a bit fluffy, but that's what it's supposed to be. If you don't like figure skating --- or if you don't like pairs skating ... you probably won't ""get"" this movie. If you do, you will love it. A warning, though - if you know too much about pairs, you may find yourself arguing out loud with the movie at times, though."
5,Love It!,Saw this movie many years ago and it left a lasting impression. My teenage daughter is now at the stage where she likes romantic comedies and has most of the newer ones. We bought it for her and sat as a family to watch it. Love never goes out of style.
2,"Loved the movie, but anamorphic widescreen was horrible!",This movie was one of my all time favorites. I wanted the updated version with the bonus interview with D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly. That was the only thing good about the newer version. The quality is worse than my VHS movie. It was extremely dark and the widescreen didn't cut it for me as this is a movie with a lot of movement in it and I'd like to see more screen for that. Not a fan of widescreen to begin with but they need to redo the quality of this beautifully acted and scripted story.
5,truly cutting edge,Never get tired of watching this movie. If you like ice skating and a great love story...this is the movie for you. Please come out with a sequel!
3,A great figure skatting story that's somewhat unpredictable.,"I really like this movie, D.B. Sweeney is a great actor. I also really enjoy figure skating and romantic movies, so this is a great movie to watch."
5,"Pure Magic, this movie!","My old VHS tape is getting worn down to a nub, so I splurged and got the ""Gold Medal Edition"" of the CUTTING EDGE, the sweetest story ever! What IS it about this movie? I can watch it again and again and never get tired of it. I only wish there had been more ""making of"" or interviews with the crew and cast. What absolutely lovely people--Moira and DB. I feel they are my old friends! So absolutely real in their performances. PURE MAGIC! And thanks to all the great people who worked on the dazzling scenes on ice, the film editing, the costuming and the music! It may not be the best-known film of all time, but it is the best-loved film of all time!"
4,Only the goofy ending spoils this pic...,"I really like The Cutting Edge. Moira Kelly and D.B. Sweeney are pretty well matched as prima donna skater and post-injury hockey player doing anything to stay in skates. Decent supporting cast. Ya gotta love the ""toe-pick"" scene. The only thing that takes away from this movie is the danged goofy mush-ball ending. If you can ignore the last 5 seconds of the film, it can be pretty funny at times."
4,I don't even like figure skating but I liked this!,I have seen this movie countless times on TV and am glad it is finally making its debut on DVD like so many other movies. What can I say about this one. I felt it was inspirational and certainly was more about the romance between the two main characters than it was about the figure skating. The main memory I have of this is the fateful 'pemchenko twist' or something like that. The most daring figure skating move ever to hit the ice. With all of the comedy that was presented with the movie and certainly with the atheletic ability of the actors this movie was definately a good choice. I have watched this at least 5 times and will watch it again. It was first released relatively clsoe to the winter olypmics in '92 and certainly caught some spark from that but generally was a sleeper hit. At least to me. I enjoyed it and so will you.
2,Wrong Aspect Ratio,"The movie is fantastic. It is a wonderful romantic comedy with hockey and skating. The soundtrack during the skating sequences is pretty bad, but all in all this is a very good movie. The problem is with the DVD. Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1? What kind of an aspect ration is that... it seems like it is made for a 4:3 TV then a letter box widescreen? It is not 16:9 and appears stretched. My TV (new model) could not find a watchable format other than the 4:3 look. too bad."
1,Cutting Edge - blu-ray,Cannot believe that this is billed as blu-ray.............it is so horrible and even my regular DVD is better quality than this............do not buy..........
4,Very good film hampered by a mediocre ending,I enjoyed the chemistry between the actors throughout this film. But something seemed to drain out of the last 10 minutes.
3,Rockeater,"This tool is very sharp, actually too sharp to have in a tool pouch. Actually my old rock saw cuts better than this one. Perhaps its too sharp to cut drywall efficiently.JS"
5,NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT,"I collect drywall saws and currently have over 352 in my personal collection. The Rockeater by Shark is the very best drywall saw available to mankind. I use it everyday and it has never let me down. I am so impressed by this saw that I had a custom leather sheath made so I can wear it at all times. Not only does it make drywall work a pleaseure but I have also used to to cut down trees, cut off the door of an SUV to help remove a crash victim, kill a bear during a hiking trip and fight off an attack by radical insurgents in the Anwar province in Iraq. I would recommend buying two of these beauties...one for each hand...especially when fighting bears or repelling insurgent attacks."
5,Sharp!!,The best drywall saw there is! Supersharp! A blade cover would help to protect it. highly recommended! as well as other Shark products.
3,"THE ""RIMAS"" de Becquer -","Becquer has a melancholy tone to most of his work - although some verses are romantic - the ""poor man"" sound helplessly filled with despair. Perhaps Byronesque. Some of his imagery is beautiful. I feel he needs a pat on his back, assuring him life will get better."
4,Courage Amongst Adversity,"Balm in Gilead is a great story of courage, perseverance, and passion in the face of adversity. Margaret Morgan-Lawrence strived to become a doctor because of the death of her younger brother. Throughout her journey to become a healer she encounters institutional racism. Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot expresses her mother's memories vividly. If you are looking for a story that insprires you to strive toward a profession you feel called to this is the book for you."
4,The Essential Book for Aviation Accident Investigations,"I'm delighted with the level of detail in this book with a few reservations. The author is outstanding on technical detail for the most part. His information on technological advances needs improvement. I look forward to seeing more information on the use of GPS mapping of crash scenes as well as better information on interviewing techniques in the next edition. While the graphics are old, they are fairly good, but I recommend color photos for the next edition. Finally, I would like to see details on digital photography in the next edition as well as underwater retrieval and analysis techniques."
1,Obsolete research.,"I was not at all impressed with this old, uninteresting article. Read it only if you need asoporific."
2,Research on empathy,"This article describes a very small research study that found no particularly surprising or significant results. The authors used a old and idiosyncratic definition of empathy, making the results difficult to generalize. Some subtle racism is evident in the researchers' approach to the study. This was apparently a quick and dirty study. Poor scholarship throughout."
2,Plodding and disappointing,"Too plodding to recommend, but Dos Passos' style is interesting. Running words together, along with his aggressive devotion to the sense of smell, make areas of this quite readable. The disjointed story lines are just too muddled overall, in my opinion (and I am a fan of Dos Passos in general).Put simply, I expected too much after enjoying 'Three Soldiers' and 'USA'. It just moves.......too......slow.....zzzzzz"
5,a gem of a novel on life in New York,"Manhattan Transfer presents the good, the bad and the ugly side of life in New York. Money seems to be the driving force behind everybody's lives and love is hard to come by. However, even the failure to realise one's goals does not deter one from hanging on in New York, as Bud does. It is, after all, the 'center of things.' It is in the end Jimmy, who emerges as the man who dares to rebel aganst the 'getting and spending' life that the city promises. The various vignettes that Dos Passos offers somehow tie up, as they all have common concerns, concerns that centre around the great American Dream. What Dos Passos really wants to reveal is the hollowness of this dream."
4,An in-depth look at human nature by a truly great modernist,"THis often overlooked work by an often overlooked member of the Lost Generation is a true classic. Although it pales in comparison to Dos Passos' ""U.S.A."" trilogy, this is a great look at mankind in the early twentieth century in its own right, as well as an early predecessor of ""U.S.A."" Using his unique style of writing Dos Passos tells the tale of one man's journey to New York, and then proceeds to conntinue the story through the eyes of every single person he meets, and everyone they meet. A great read."
1,"Let's Put on a Musical!: How to Choose the Right Show for Your School, Community, or Professional Theater","Arrived in a timely manner, however this is the exact same book as the prior edition. We went through it page by page for comparison.I was expecting new shows, updated synopsis', but found none of it, only a different cover. I, for one am very disappointed."
3,Lets do put on a musical!,"Although there are glaring faux pas in this book..wrong vocal range, rather irrelevant political comments by the the author,and and to me the biggest mistake, giving away the ending of one musical, this book is a must for any musical director on any level. I have been involved in musical theatre in various forms and organizational levels for many years and really enjoyed looking into what the author had to say about some of my favorites. Having just witnessed a LONG awaited production of 1776 by my local community theatre group, I found the book right on the money in the case of a musical that has ""too many men"". Since the director has on occasion corresponded with Mr Filichia,I would imagine that he might have used the book as well. Would be nice if there were some kind of performer cross index. And the musical that he gave away the ending of is ""Shenandoah""(talk about an overabundance of men!) So dont read the last paragraph of the description....."
3,WALKABOUT MENS CASUAL,NICE SHOES FIT WELL HARD TO PUT ON OPENING IS SMALL TO GET YOUR FOOT IN ... DONT BUY IF YOU HAVE A HIGH INSTEP
5,Really good,"First of all, this film was very good. Very dramatic. I would reccomend it.Second of all, someone said it wasn't realisitc the way the patients were treated. Yes, at the time it was. At the time they didn't treat ""crazy"" people like humans."
3,Have Been Watching Since I Was a Little Girl,"If you're reading this review because you're wondering whether or not to watch this movie - please watch it. It's a classic. It's sad, funny, upsetting, thought provoking....takes you through the entire gammut of emotions. All the stars are here before they even realized they were stars and their performance reflects what they all soon became - bonafied movie stars! Watch it. I don't think you'll regret it."
5,AUDIO IN ITALIAN ?,Blank.I could know if l' audio in Italian is present?Questo è il mio film preferito. Scusate se non parlo bene l'inglese. Grazie
4,DESPERATE SANITY AMIDST MADNESS,"Based on Ken Kesey's 1962 memoirish novel, the resulting movie's a timeless metaphor for the human condition.Sterling performances by the entire cast mesh perfectly under Milos Foreman's precise direction. Jack Nicholson is the everyman who discovers a desperate sanity amidst the madness, but it's Louise Fletcher who steals the show as an unforgettable nurse devoid of compassion."
5,"Sane, Superb and Scary","The acting, dialogue and situations are to say the least REALISTIC and that is what is so scary at times. It shows how you can get swallowed into any situation and get lose reality. Directing and acting superb. A necessary addition to any collection of excellent/superb films. While watching it you may question your sanity in terms of the film."
5,Nicholson's best acting job.....EVER!!!,"O Me Digas! This film has it all. Right when you think it's safe to laugh, you find yourself sitting on the sofa in complete shock. There are many elements to this film and they are all entwined perfectly.Nicholson plays an eccentric who is forced to stay at a psych ward. It's there that he begins to make his co-nutties feel a little bit better about themselves. He ends up becoming the nemesis of the head nurse, and she counters by making his life a living hell. The end of the film will shock you and make you feel resentment towards the authorities in the hospital.This film has a great message, humor, a high shock value, and Jack Nicholson at his very best. You cannot go wrong with this film, one of my personal all time favorites."
4,Great movie but.............,"it will never live up to the book. Nicholson's portrayal of McMurphy while great, does not live up to the book as many things in the movie do not. I read the book first so the movie was kind of a let down. The movie is just way to topical and really doesn't flesh the characters out at all. So watch the movie, and if you like it read the book. The book blows the movie away."
5,one flew over the cuckoos nest,"Thank you so much for my order, I was very happy with my purchase it came just in time. All in good condition and the packaging protected the video well. I was very happy with the price. I will be happy to purchase from you again, like I said all was up to my expectation."
4,"Great movie, but DVD could have been done better","This is a classic movie with no doubt. The DVD is poorly done. The picture and sound weren't even average and at times the transfer seems almost like VHS. The DVD has no extras on it, not even a tralior. If you like this movie, I would not buy it until a better version comes out."
4,Martini,"I just saw the movie a few weeks ago for the 3rd time, and among other funny scenes, I found myself laughing once again at the scene when Jack Nicholson's/Mack's girlfriend 'Candi' asks the guys: ""So are you all crazy?"", and Danny Devito's character Martini answers simply: ""Yes."" He is so adorable! Yet, can someone please tell me what was wrong with him? I don't think he had a mental illness; he was just mentally challenged, right? I always thought state hospitals were for the mentally ill (i.e. disorders such as schizophrenia/bipolar disorder) only. If someone has read the book and knows more about Martini's condition, let me know!"
5,Real Life!,"After visiting one of these facilities, I could see that a lot of research went into this movie. Which came first though, the chicken or the egg?"
5,A Classic,"I bought this to repalce an old copy but the acting is excellent. Jack Nicholson, the topic, the social and medical issues presented still haunt us today as a society."
4,Great movie,Jack Nicholson does a brilliant job in this movie; great performance and acting overall. A good insight on how mental health was treated a 40-50 years ago.
5,Great Film!,Excellent movie; Jack Nicholson is fantastic as always and the movie is still relevant today. I highly recommend this movie!
5,A gem for the ages.,"This has always been one of my favorite movies, and having just watched it again confirms my opinion that this is one of the best films ever made. Could ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" be an example of truly flawless cinema? It seems that way to me. One of the most powerful and heart-wrenching films I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few. A masterpiece for the ages."
3,COOOOKU,"This is an old video but it was very interesting when I saw. If you like surprise endings, you will like this video. The message is if you pretend that you are crazy you will be taken seriously."
1,disappointed,"I was most disappointed because I wanted a DVD and it was featured as a DVD and when it came, it was a VHS tape. Don't think I would trust this person again for anything."
5,a paradoxal film,"the most fascinating as well as the most fustrating film because at the end of this movie ,you feel like killing the first nurse you see!Probably Milos foreman's finest movie."
5,very powerful and moving,it is really good i think it was one of the best made becuase it shows people life inside a mental hospital and one mans misson to get out and be free
5,"Great movie, great DVD.","Excellent quality throughout. The video looks fantastic. There is some light grain in the opening and closing shots, possibly due to opticals. The image throughout is vivid, clear of artifacts, and detailed. The sound has fantastic fidelity. The extras include a great making-of documentary, facinating commentary, deleted scenes, and an OK trailer.This is a must-own...avoid the old 1-disc edition released in 1997!"
4,A moving experience,"It took years to get Ken Kesey's novel to the big screen but, when it did, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next"" became only the second film to date to sweep the Oscars (""It Happened One Night"" was the first) and brought the oft-nominated Jack Nicholson his first statuette. It was a richly deserved award, matched only by Louise Fletcher's sinister turn as Nurse Ratched, the nemisis to Nicholson's Randall MacMurphy. Set in a 60's mental asylum (and psychiatric centers were asylums then in every sense of the word), we are treated to MacMurphy's antics as he tries to fake mental illness while, at the same time, he works to convince his fellow patients they're not as crazy as they think they are. But the final scene is timeless, a masterfully played out scene that gives us the real hope that the human soul does remain long after we're done. As a footnote, who can forget Louise Fletcher's powerfully moving acceptance speech at the 1976 ceremony when she pulled off Best Actress?"
5,AWESOME! ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST,"THIS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE! I GO ABSOLUTELY ""CUCKOO"" FOR ""ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST""!!! I RECOMMEND THIS FILM ALONG WITH THE BOOK! THIS FILM HAS SOME HUMOR AND SOME SERIOUSNESS!!IF YOU LOVE JACK NICHOLSON, YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE! THIS IS A DEFINITE ***** MOVIE AND WORTH ALL OSCARS. I TIP MY TOP HAT FOR JACK NICHOLSON, CHRISTOPHER LLOYD, DANNY DEVITO AND MANY OTHER ACTORS IN THIS FILM! JACK IS A CONVINCING CRAZY MCMURPHY!!!IF YOU BUY THE FILM, YOU MUST ALSO BUY THE BOOK TO GO ALONG WITH IT!! BUY THEM BOTH TODAY--I AM SURE YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!"
4,An Old Classic,This was purchased after watching Shutter Island..I wanted to compare the two. This one was more realistic AND more frightening. No one compares to Jack and I do like DeCaprio but both were good movies.
5,"Good time, good price, great product.","I had this paper I had to write on a movie and I decided to do it on one I had never seen before. My boyfriend suggested ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" so I began my search. When I found this one it was perfect. Just the right price and it came in perfect timing."
5,Beyond Perfection,"I cannott praise this superb film enough. First of all, the acting is magnificent. Louise Fletcher is outstanding as the sadistic Nurse Ratched, and Jack Nicholsion gives an equally stunning performance as the outgoing R.P MacMurphy. Also, the direction is masterful- Bravo to Milos Forman!All and all this is an incredible film and I'd put it ahead of CITIZEN KANE and CASABLANCA any day of the week."
4,A classic,"One Flew Over The Cukoo's Nest is a classic movie. it is so because, it deals with human nature, the need to be free as humans and whether or not one can ""connect"" with someone that just has a wall herself (the nurse).This was Jack Nicholson's time. He had done some forgetable films before Easy RIder. Easy Rider got him into the mainstream, and then Cukoo's Nest catapulted him.All if the actors were great.The direction (Milos Forman), the writing (Bo Goldman, Dale Wasserman, Ken Kesey, Lawrence Hauben), the production were all first rate.I could watch this over again."
5,Darn that nurse!,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is edgy, surprisely comical, and heartbreaking in parts. Jack Nicholson won his first Oscar for this movie, this is his best role to date. Nicholson brings depth and vulgarity to his role, he knows how to balance between with ease and talent. Louise Fletcher plays Nurse Ratchett, I'll just say she is not a sweetheart, she plays a character that most people won't like but she's fabulous in this drama. I highly recommend watching this beloved classic, enjoy!"
5,A MUST SEE CLASSIC! FILMS THIS GREAT DON'T COME AROUND OFTEN!,This is such a great movie! I never laughed so much in a drama and it wasn't because of something unintentional. There are genuine laughs to be had in this fantastic sad but inspirational story. Nicholson has never been better and won an Oscar for his role as R.P. McMurphy! Films like this are few and far between. If you've never seen this 5 time Oscar winning movie you don't know what your missing. A classic gem that should be in everyone's film collection. The DVD transfer is excellent with interesting extras on the 2 disc edition.!
5,A TEN STAR MOVIE BEAUTIFULLY TRANSFERED TO DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS ONE MOVIE THAT I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT ANYONE WOULD NOT LOVE! IT'S NO WONDER THAT IT WON ALL THE AWARDS AND I CAN'T THINK OF A MOVIE THAT THE STORY IS PERFECT FROM BEGINING TO END. I WISH I COULD GIVE 10 STARS. THE DVD IS BEAUTIFUL AND THE SPECIAL FEATURES TELLS A GOOD STORY ON HOW LONG IT TOOK TO FINALLY GET THE DIRECTOR MILOS FORMAN TO DO THE MOVIE. ONE MOVIE FOR ALL COLLECTIONS.
4,One of the best film i have ever seen!,"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest! I think this movie was great. I like it, because the charcters are ""well-acted"" especially by Jack Nicholson. Also the nurse's part is cast and acted extraordinarily by Luise Fletcher. The whole film is really entertaining. You can laugh, cry and enjoy. I have seen a lot of films, but this one is one of the best. Usually, I don't like films which are laid in mental hospitals, but movie is exciting. ""One Flev over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is a film which shows us the real life in such hospitals. I like that very much and so I recommend this movie to everyone. SEE IT!"
3,I FOUND IT INTERESTING BUT NOT MUCH ACTION,"THE BOOK SOMETIMES BECOMES BORING BECAUSE THERE IS LITTLE ACTION. THE CHARACTERS ARE INTERESTING ESPECIALLY THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE BIG NURSE AND MCMURPHY. HOWEVER BY THE END OF THE BOOK YOU DON'T CARE MUCH ABOUT THE CHARACTERS, AND THE ENDING IS PREDICTABLE. ALSO, A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MCMURPHY WHO HAS HAD THE LABOTOMY!? END"
3,Watch Girl Interrupted instead.,"This movie was interesting and a bit emotional, a bit good; but its pace is slow (the norm for its time.) Also, the ending really didn't fit the movie. I'd suggest you just watch Girl Interrupted. That seems to be pretty much a remake but much more lively, in color, and the ending fits quite well."
4,A great classic movie with some interesting view points,"I've had some bad experiences in the past with blu-ray discs and older movies. Most of the time they are just scamming people out of a couple bucks by putting it in a blu-ray box.This isn't one of those movies, the picture quality and sound quality are above and beyond the original. Definitely a great addition to my blu-ray collection."
5,A great great Movie !,"This is a GREAT movie. The acting is fantastic. Nicholson is just amazing also with the other guys. You understand easily why the movie won 5 academy awards. It's funny to see Dany Devito with hair and Louise Fletcher, the nasty but so quiet nurse, is so gorgeous and unfortunately evil. You won't understand how much you will sympathize with all those nuts but It happens. Thanks Milos Forman !"
5,One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (film),"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (film) *****The film adaptation of 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' the great American Novel by Ken Kasey is almost as perfect as the book. Jock Nicholson plays the lead role of McMurphy, the work camp sentenced felon who claims insanity to escape is fate. Little Does he know he is biting off more then he can chew as he soon becomes aquainted with his own personal hell, Nurse Ratchet played by Louise Fletcher.The movie does not follow the book completly but does so enough not to lose any impact of any scene or plot line. A few minor changes here and there set the directors' view apart.While not as suspenceful as the book and not as detailed the movie still does a fine job of bringing one of the most important books in history to mainstream culture. Nicholson's performance is breathtaking and the movie as a whole is flawless. A personal favorite."
4,Nice addition for those collecting,"I deliberately held off on buying this Oscar winner when the first offering was released because it now seems that most of the movie studios are realizing the full potential of DVD by going back and rereleasing special ""Collector"" editions. Especially with the Oscar winners and the AFI 100. ""Cuckoo"" is no exception and I'm glad I waited. One of the best behind-the-scenes documentaries I've seen. Great stories by Douglas, Zaentz, Forman and Goldman. Jack, however, is noticably missing. That aside, some of the deleted scene are hilarious and it's obvious some time and thought went into the new addition with crisp reworked sound and letterbox format. Fans will not be disappointed."
5,"Fascinating, entertaining","Based on a novel by Ken Kesey, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a clever story with an excellent twist.Kudos to Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher and Milos Forman for quite an excellent movie."
5,One of my favorites.,"This is one of my favorite Jack Nicholson movies. The collector's edition has some nice goodies: a 52 page hard-bound book, reproduction of the original press book, a 52 card deck, 4 mini-reproduction of the original worldwide theatrical posters and 6 cast/character photos. A great package for a great movie that received 5 Academy Awards."
5,A Humble Opinion,"One of my absolute all time favorites. Jack Nicholson is amazing, the cast is unbelievable, the story is very touching. I will never be able to explain how great this movie is! :) The DVD is amazing - tons of extras, deleted scenes, documentary. I would definitely recommend it!"
4,Very Good Movie,"I just watched this movie today. I thought it was very good. I'm reading the book for school. We have to read the book but we can't watch the movie. Our school district won't let us. They say it's to ""graphic"". Big deal. I didn't think it was. Jack Nicholson played his part as McMurphey very well. Although it may be a good movie, it is not for everyone.Rated R For Adult Language, Adult Situations, Some Violence and Sexuality/Nudity.Running Time: 133 Minutes"
4,How Times Change,"While I commend the excellent acting of the main characters, I found the film to be boring. After an hour of Nicholson's antics and conflict with the hospital--enough already! The believability is poor. No wonder the novel's author sued. When the Chief is carrying the cabinet, he can barely walk and breathe. But the next shot shows it flying out the heavy-metal screened window like it was launched from a catapult. That action clearly made enough noise to awaken most of the hospital, yet we see many of the patients in that very ward slowly waking up due to other noise."
3,"Excellent movie, poor DVD","One of my favorites. Unfortunately, not properly remastered. This DVD has only VHS quality."
3,Captioning?,This isn't really a review. Can someone please tell me if this DVD has Closed Captioning? I need to find this out for a friend.Thank you
4,"Not a ""towering"" performance, but very nice indeed","These performances from 1962 highlight the wonderful sounds that used to be made from the Prague orchestras. With the fall of the Iron Curtain and more availability of western recordings, Prague started sounding like London. Non-wobbly horns, blended winds, etc. However, if liked the historic distinctive sounds of these orchestras, you're in for a treat. Suk takes a nice, sober approach, letting the music speak for itself. This does not imply autopilot, or boring. But this is not the Beethoven on steroids that some hotshots insist on. Honest virtuosity serving the music, is the best way I can describe it. And to hear the wind choir piping up with that distinctive timbre, is just great. AND the 2 Romances for a very useful compilation. Maybe not your first choice, but definately one worth owning. Nice, bright, recording quality."
4,"Cute, mellow and educational","The title song is very catchy, you will find yourself trying to memorize the words to sing to your toddler if your car cassette happens to be broken. My 2-yr old really likes ""Michael row the boat ashore,"" especially the verse where ""Jordan's river is chilly and cold..."" he rubs his arms and says ""BRRRR!""I liked the ""Changing Garden of Mr. Bell,"" very pretty and touching. Also ""C-A-N-A-D-A"", lots of information about Canada that is educational and amusing.The only song my son didn't like was ""First People."" I can only assume because it has too much talking, not enough singing. But overall, a fun album to own for a toddler."
2,Disappointed,"We love Raffi and had heard ""Bananaphone"" on Pandora, hoping to one day get the CD. Got this as a Christmas present for my husband to listen to with the children and the songs were not fun...more ballad-style. If we had known the CD was all ballads we could have just bought the song. Don't prepare for a toe tapper with this one."
3,Hohner Puck,"I bought this harmonica on a whim, thinking it would be good for just carrying around in my pocket. It is very small, and fits nicely in a pocket. The sound however, is also very small. It's loud enough, I'm talking about sound quality; it's kind of mousey sounding. It can still be fun to play with, but a full-sized harmonica is still a relatively small instrument and pretty easy to carry."
4,Nice Product,"The smell is a bit unusual, but it makes my hair feel great, along with the conditioner. Will purchase again. What I liked most about the product is the Apple Cider Vinegar and the other natural ingredients. I'm of African American decent, so I have curly/wavy hair, and this product doesn't lather greatly, so that's good for my natural hair. If you're used to lather, this isn't the product for you, but it you're looking for natural, healthy hair products, I say, ""This is it!"""
5,Great Must See for High School Graduate,"I think Justin did a great job at taking the stress out of stepping onto a college campus. The secrets in this DVD are extremely practical and well researched. As a former teacher, I know these strategies are essential for college success. I recommend this for students, parents and educators. Great job!"
5,Star Wars Galaxy of Fear,In Star Wars Galaxy of Fear Nightmare Machine. Two kids from the destroyed planet Alderan has foiled three phases of ProjectStarscream. This evil plot was made from evil scientist Bog.When Tash and Zak go to Hologram Funworld. It is not so fun. It'scary. The people start disapearing. The Holograms are real.Will Tash and Zak stop another plot of Project Starscream. Readthis book to find out. What I like most about the book is whenZak spews tons of cards on Bog's face. I didn't like about this book is that it is comfusing. This book is good. You should really try to read it.
5,Review of the Nightmare Machine,"I own all of the Galaxy of Fear books except Spore and this is best after the Brain Spiders and Planet Plague. There's one character in it from 2 of the movies- Lando Calrissian. While exploring, Zak, Tash, Lando, and Devee find an attraction called the Nightmare Machine. The owner of Hologram Fun World lets them try it. They are shown their greates fears, and must overcome them. There are some fears that real peopie might have in it. This is a good book in a good series."
5,frog mold,"Bought these to a whim so I vould make candy molds in the shape of frogs, put rice crispies in them now I call them crunchy frog. (nudge nudge know what I mean)"
4,flimsy,"the molding was very cute, but the form was flimsy. I made the regrettable mistake of trying to machine wash it due to there being a big sticker price tag affixed to it which left residue I had to remove with goo gone. The form warped in the wash (I imagine it is not reccomended, so I don't blame the product) but I was able to bend the form so it will lay mostly flat. In all, a good form with cute molding but really should be made of stiffer stuff. Also, seller should not affix price tags with glue to the mold."
3,Did I say it was small?,"Nicely glazed and kilned, like a small, colorful Fiesta Ware dish. We have one color for each of our three cats. Do they love them? Of course. But all three push some kibble out of the dish as they eat. Did I say that this dish is rather small?"
2,Not worth buying,"The dish is easy to clean, a very nice color and yes a nice piece of glazeware....but it is way too shallow. It really is more like a slightly curved plate. When the product says sip of milk they really mean sip. It would work well for serving soft cat food, but nothing else."
1,did not receive,This item was shipped to the wrong address even though the order confirmation I received from you had the right address. According to the UPS records they had been given an address different than the one on the confirmation order! I am still try to get the item sent to me but have not had any luck so far.VERY DISTRESSFUL!!!
5,Where dreams and poetry meet,"A review from the author of DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF: A PERSONAL APPROACH TO DREAM INTERPRETATION; and DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO DREAMS, DAYDREAMS, AND FANTASIES.In IMMACULATE BRIGHT ROOMS, Michael Hettich offers dreamlike flights of fancy to the center of what it means to be human, fragile, and still hopeful for connection. A lovely collection of poetry to ponder and savor. See also his MANY SIMPLE THINGS."
3,cheap quality,"the style of the boot is very cute. it fits really loose, not sure if they're just too big but i ordered the same size shoe that i wear normally. they are pretty thin so don't expect them to keep your feet much warmer than sneakers, they just cover a little more leg. the lacy part of the shoe easily gets dog hair stuck in it and also catches on things. I bought boots to help keep my feet dry at work and i knew that these particular boots wouldn't be ""water proof"" but these get wet instantly! my skate shoes protect against the water better than these. so these boots are ""cute"" but they aren't made well at all."
1,Embryo / DVD,Shame on Passport Video. My VHS Tapes look better than this DVD. The transfer looks to be off someones 6 hour tape. What a waste. I'll think twice before I purchase another Passport Video.
1,can you say crapola?,"all i can say about this purchase is ""BUYER BEWARE"".could barely make out this movie the transfer was so BAD!!!if anyone has acquired a decent transfer please contact me with details.saw this as a kid at the drive-in and had fond memories of it. could only tolerate a few minutes of the dark choppy mess with even crappier audio. yuck"
1,Can I have that 44 mins of my life back?,"I could only stomach 44 minutes of this movie before I had to turn it off. There was nothing about this movie that was good save for Rock Hudson, which is actually quite sad if you think about how he use to make star quality movies. I guess the 70s were the time for the B movie genre. The video quality is so very poor and the plot so very badly written and executed. It requires me to rate it with at least a one although I don't think it worthy even of that."
1,A TOTAL RIP OFF,"Not a bad movie for its time and type but this is the WORST transfer of all time. It looks as if someone taped it off broadcast television. The first images, at night, are so dark and muddy it's not even clear what's on the screen. I had really looked forward to having this in my collection but after watching it I threw it in the garbage. Utterly worthless."
1,Silly junk,Best actor: the dogBest Actress: wasn't in this movieRunning time with banter of witty friends and cocktails: 114 minutesRunning time home alone: 114 hoursWinner: Worst production values for the yearWinner: Worst copy to DVD - EVER
2,Embryo,"Most the video was dark and it was really hard trying to see the picture. The audio was good but overall, I would rate the quality of the picture as bad."
2,HORRIBLE TRANSFER,"One of the worst video transfers of any of the movies that I own and, I have many movies. Its so dark and poor quality that I can't honestly recomend it to anyone. The only reason that it gets any stars at all is that I could hear it like radio and I like Rock Hudson as well as Barbara Carrera."
3,creepy,"I saw this movie once and thought it was another one of these made for TV movies , but I was entertained , since there was nothing else on , but I have to admit I was creeped out .And to see todays medical technology , makes me wonder ."
3,"Not Dead Cities, but good nonetheless","The opening track Moonchild is repetitive, but that's not such a bad thing. I think it does a good job of introducing the cd. Don't Save Us From the Flames and * are my favorite tracks on this cd. Flames takes us from fast paced choruses to dreamy, slow paced verses with few instruments. Asterisk(*) is probably the ""heaviest"" track on the album and I love it for that. Manic guitars and vocals, and soaring electronics. What a perfect combination! This is a good cd, at times cheesy, but it certainly doesn't surpass Dead Cities."
3,Simple envelopments,"3 1/2M83 followed up their popular debut with more airy electro-art, often shining just as, if not brighter in the production department than with actual songwriting, which can lend to partial aesthetic overkill sporadically. With hearts in the right place though, most of these repetitive sound washes of beauty do work, and are moving."
4,"really, really good.","the first time i heard m83, was on james lavelle's global underground barcelona. the song was ""run into flowers"". i never really paid much attention to it. i just thought it was a decent song.then, about a year later, i see ""dead cities, red seas, and lost ghosts"" at ear-xtacy in louisville. i bought it, not really knowing what to expect. i was blown away. amazed......""before the dawn...."", though not as good as ""dead cities..."", picks up where the last one left off. i'm not gonna try to give a detailed explanation of what m83 sounds like, because it will take too long. let me just say it's pop music for the year 3000.my favorite song is ""teen angst"". it sends shivers up my spine everytime i hear it. that is a beautiful song. absolutely immaculate.""dead cities...."" 4and1/2 stars.""before the dawn....."" 4 starsbuy either one, or buy both. it's a win-win situation.this message is not endorsed by the bush administration, halliburton or its affiliates.(dp)"
3,What am I missing????,"Ok, let's just cut to the chase and say that it is becoming very tiresome to hear comparisons to Slowdive, Ride, Lush, Chapterhouse, etc etc. There was a shoegaze scene and it is long gone. Many bands have tried to duplicate it but it will never be the way it was. RIP all those bands for they paved such a crucial scene that will live forever. Now onto M83..the idea is great and at times it is enjoyable but those times are few and far between. This cd is all over the place and once the mood kicks in, it suddenly changes. It goes from cheesy rock to decent ambient to complete Pink Floyd rip off. It is mostly filler. It is not a horrible cd at all but certainly not worth the hype."
5,At risk of redundancy...,"This album is just mindblowing. I can't decide if it's better than Dead Cities because they evoke entirely different moods for me, but I'll be surprised if an album comes out this year that I enjoy more.Also, in response to the reviewer who said M83 was entirely electronic, in interviews, they (he?) frequently reference using guitars, organs, etc. so I'm not sure that the whole album is synths."
3,Ran out of ideas?,"I really liked their first cd. Who knows, maybe this one will grow on me, but it seems like there aren't as many new ideas on this as the first. Still a good album, but I was expecting more."
2,Ambient Prococateur,"French ambient provocateur Anthony Gonzalez trades the elegant white noise of Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts for a more pompous adventure with Before the Dawn Heals Us. Gonzalez's soundscapes were once contained and mimetic: songs with titles such as ""Birds"" and ""On a White Lake, Near a Green Mountain"" contained a hint of what was to come. The songs on Before the Dawn Heals Us become the soundtrack to an imagined concept: a particularly harrowing night in the life of what, from the titles, may well be a vampire. Or a drug addict. Or someone who just can't sleep. It's hard to know from the music, which features much synthetic choral manipulation and dissonant guitars. The best bits are the spoken word interludes, especially on the beautifully conceived and executed ""Car Chase Terror!"", which is all that and more."
2,Hagar's Lost Voyage,"This TV special could have been great- but was not. In my opinion, it could have been better.I'd love to see Steven Spielberg do a live action Hagar movie with Danny Devito and Bette Midler. Ah well. Maybe someday! Best wishes, Chris Browne"
2,DANGER-DANGER unstable game- Save your money!,Watch out! This Russian-French produced game has the most unstable copy protection scheme I've ever seen. The original dual-layer DVD disc has the Tages protection encoded in the disc. The game loads up about once every 30 tries because the copy protection is unable to detect that the original retail DVD is in your drive. You will be frustrated and then angry!The few times it has loaded the game is okay- a little quirky but okay.I bought it because the free download demo worked fine and it was fairly fun- even with the software bugs and crashes.I cannot recommend the retail version- the copy protection is a serious and infuriating slap at the gaming public.
3,"Fun Game, but not spectacular","I'll keep this short.-I found the game highly entertaining.-I didn't experience any major bugs that I can remember.-You're choices between Tech and Nature effect the look of Silverfall.-Cell-shading type of graphics were well done.-My only real complaint is that it was too easy. I was a combat spec'd Tech Troll, and Even late in the game I was one-shotting things. I was also leveling up every 15 minutes or so. At first it was cool, but after awhile it took away the excitement you normally feel when you ding in other RPGs. Basically, I would say this is a good game for the casual RPG fan, or anyone that just wants to sit down for an hour and bash things."
2,"bad, bad, bad","Where to start..graphics hideous, sound terrible, game play buggy. Avoid unless u can get it for under a buck!!! I think I spent 3.00 for it and am using it for a coaster!"
4,Awesome,"I have only played the demo, and i have to say, wow, they sure did somthing right. Fast gamesply, not as fast as Diablo 2, but with the graphics that sort of speed would push alot of systems pretty hard. The quest system is fun and not too mundane like some games quests. The map system is handy, you can zoom to settlment locations.This game is definitely on my to buy list."
3,not the good ones,"These are not the Minolta 8x40 Activa WP FP that are $159 on other sites whose MSRP is $276. This MSRP is $159 and they are selling them for $139, so they must be a different cheaper pair.I don't know what these are but I don't think they are SKU # 8460-417, the same that are highly rated on ConsumerReports and ePionions.Maybe I'm wrong but I would be careful if you want to buy them and get what you were expecting."
5,Very cool recording,I bought this CD to supplement learning the Title song for a choir concert that I sang in. The recording quality is excellent. I love John Rutter's music.
4,Fine quick read on delegating tasks,"This small book (95 pages) is a great look at delegating - the barriers and benefits, exactly how to set goals, how to communicate, and how to track delegations. It is aimed largely at the supervisory level, and is more task oriented. Thus, it is probably not as useful for an executive wanting to delegate large responsibilities, but still is a good basic look at delegating."
2,As a teacher sees it,"I had the pleasure of reading reviews of this title before buying the product. Unfortunately the reviews I read did not clarify my mind about the product and I ordered it anyway, I was under the wrong impression that this dvd will create interest in various topics of physics among my students. However, to my utter dismay, the video is for those students who want to learn the subject without a teacher and to me it looks like a dry presentation of a very interesting subject. I would be useful only for those who wish to study the subject of physics at home without the help or guidance of a teacher.-drheracoaching"
1,disappointed....,"This is the 2nd time I have purchased this item - I loved my 1st one. It was a great holster; I only replaced it because the elastic siding was wearing out & making my blackberry slide out much too easily. I dropped it on several occasions because it would slide out of the case. But it took it over 2 years of daily wear to get to that point - so I considered it a really good product & ordered another one. This time the price was about a third of what I had initially paid. Unfortunately - the quality is definitely sub-par. After less than 3 months, the clip feels loose & the inside covering is peeling apart in 2 places and exposing my blackberry to a gummy residue. At the price - it's not worth sending it back. I would have rather paid more & gotten a quality product like I did the first time. I can't help but wonder if this is just a lemon or is it counterfeit?"
3,Pretty Good,"I have had this holster for a little over a month to hold my blackberry pearl. It securely holds my phone and protects it well. The clip is more handy than I had anticipated and swivel to different degrees which is useful. It seems to be well made but the little blackberry emblem has already fallen off which makes the case look kinda ghetto. Overall, a pretty good case for the price but plan on having that small repair."
5,Just what I was looking for,"After finding that my new BlackBerry Pearl did not come with a holster, I started searching for one on Amazon. While viewing another third-party case, I saw the little blurb that showed that most people that had viewed that item bought this one instead, and now I know why. This is the perfect holster for the Pearl. It fits the device snugly, is easy to use with one hand, is well-made, and just looks sharp. It has a solidly-attached plastic spring-clamp type belt clip that has a locking-swivel to hold the case in place at any angle you prefer. All in all, this is a great product and if you're looking for a holster for your Pearl 8100, I strongly recommend this one."
3,Smooth transaction,"My transaction went very smoothly; however, product broke right after my 30-day return policy ran out. Beware of the product quality."
2,"Nice case, CHEAP belt clip","I purchased 2 of these and they both suffered the same fate: a broken belt clip. The belt clip snapped off when I bumped the holster (bound to happen when you're wearing it on your side). The case itself is great, love that it allows the pearl to recognize that it's in the holster, but to me is worthless without a sturdier clip.For what it's worth, the seller is great it's just the product that isn't."
2,"Looks great and works great, but not long-lasting","I am now in the process of ordering my third one of these, which is a testament to how much I like them. This case is really sleek looking and I love the fact that it automatically puts the BlackBerry into sleep mode. My first one lasted almost a year before the swivel clip broke off. My second one was ordered April 28, and here it is June 27 and the clip already broke. I told my brother about this excellent holster and he is already on his third one in 6 months.I love the functionality and style of this holster, but it seems the quality is not there in the way the clip attaches to the case. I suggest ordering at least two so you have a backup when the first one breaks."
1,Do Not Buy!,I purchased this product and it was great for about a month. The other day I was getting out of my car and the clip broke off from my belt. The phone fell into the street and was destroyed by oncoming traffic. I'm out a $400.00 phone because of the cheap plastic used in this product. If your looking for durability look elsewhere.
