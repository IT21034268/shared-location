1,I couldn't stop laughing,"See it here, a clever George W. Bush, laid-back and on top of everything. Well, he never calls him ""George W. Bush"", but the character who is President in this novel puts his cowboy boots on his desk and calls his brother Jeb, who is Governor of Florida.The protagonist is the most brilliant person who ever lived, he works at the Pentagon and just avoids University Faculty because, gosh darn it, they are so dumb.The premise of the book was fun, but the relentless Rush-like Republican Party Propaganda distracted from the book. This may be readable in a century or so when everyone has forgotten the current politics, but that day is not here yet."
4,Not to shabby!! A darn good read,"Well this is definitely better than Doc Travis's two book. I found this to be a darn entertain'n read boys and girls! Definitely one for the collection. There are of course the parts of the book I would have done differently, but JR manages to pull off yet another great yarn.I especially liked the StarShip Troopers reference and I'm sure you will too once you read the tail and figure out what its all about. This tale has it all science experiment gone terribly wrong, alien invasion, allies and back-stabbers, new tech showcased, and a possible sequel hinted at, another good read from Baen Publishing.I do appreciate the authors realism as opposed to Doc Travis. Yes, I'm a proud American, but even I don't think the boys in uniform are gonna kick those nasty aliens back off planet without a single lose... Something Doc Travis for all his enjoyable tails needs to take to heart.I definitely recommend this, pretty darn good!"
3,It is what it is,"All of the reviewers who are bashing this book for being too political or right-wing don't seem to know much about warrior culture. This is military sci-fi, written from the American military's point of view. If there's any sense of ethnocentricity or triumphalism, it's because the professional military is very proud of what it does. If you believe the military is nothing but a bunch of trigger-happy thugs who have no place in civilized society, that's YOUR bias, not the author's. And for God's sake, why are you reading military sci-fi?That being said, this is still a very mediocre story. If a Hollywood producer pitched to you a ""big summer blockbuster, 'Stargate' meets 'Starcraft'!"" this is pretty much the story you'd get. Ringo shamelessly steals almost everything, and after the premise has been established, the story writes itself. There are no surprises or character development to speak of. Yawn."
2,Set in an Alternate (Bizarro) Universe,"I like much of John Ringo's books but this one is weak. The overall plot line could be fun but the characters are not believable. The main character seems like a version of superman without the Krytonite weakness.The story would be more enjoyable if the author did not stop to ram crud down your throat every few pages. John Ringo is one of the 10% of the people in the US who does not believe in global warming and who think dropping nukes is OK. Also, he seems to be afraid of ""liberals"" and other bogeymen. Why some macho guy can be afraid of liberal pansies is beyong me!Then there was the description of a President who has a brother named Jeb who is the govenor of Florida. After reading that sycophantic twaddle, I realized that this story was set in an alternate bizarro universe where everything is backwards. Of course, he gives that away in the book's title."
1,Politics,"The best definition of a chocolate chip cookie I ever heard was that the cookie exists only as something to hold the chocolate chips.In a John Ringo story, the plot exists only as a vehicle for the author to spout politics.Which he does quite often !If you're a Republican and into Fantasy, you'll LOVE this.If you are a friend of Rush Limbaugh, buy him a copy.If you're not a Right-Winger, don't read this unless you like being insulted.It's a pity this guy can't just write an entertaining story and leave the politics out;but I guess he can't."
2,VHS Audio Problems,"After using the DVD and VHS for about a month with no problems, the VHS suddenly lost its audio capability. This is very annoying since I now can not return it to www.Amazon.com and the closest service center is an hour drive from our house. The 1-800 line kept me on hold for 20 minutes before someone told me I had to take the unit to a service center (big help). I would not recommend this unit."
1,I'm getting a new one!,"This product has had problems from the start...when the DVD plays, it makes a VERY loud whirring sound. When I tried to get it fixed under the warranty, they claimed there was no problem at all, and refused to allow me to return it. Now ten months later the whirring sound is so loud, you can't even hear some of the dialog. We're buying a new one, definitely a different model, and giving this trash away."
3,Did you hear that?,"The VHS player sound was perfect, but I could hardly hear the movie when I played a DVD. I bought this unit to go with my new Sony WEGA TV, but the sound output on the DVD side was low even when the TV volume was cranked up to maximum. I called GoVideo to see if this was a known problem and they were not aware of it. I checked all connections, bought new cables, and nothing improved the sound. Unable to resolve the problem, I returned the unit and am still shopping around. The DVD output volume was my only problem, otherwise I thought it was a great machine, so I can only give it an average rating."
1,DVD quit on first day,"Very dissapointed with this product. The very first time I used it, I tried to watch a new DVD and it kept losing the signal (picture/sound would go away). I replaced the cables and tried different DVDs but this problem continued. The VCR worked okay but overall the product was very slow to respond to any command. I like the idea of having a combination DVD/VCR and the price was reasonable and maybe I got stuck with a bad one. But I would not buy from this company again."
1,Bad right out of the gate,"Bad experience. I've owned it for about three hours now. The very first tape I put in the VCR unit has became jammed. (I've owned my previous VCR for nine years and never once had a tape get jammed.) It won't eject, play, or rewind. The nearest service center is a four-hour drive from my house. I'm sending it back and getting a brand that has a service center near me."
1,DVR 4300 has real problems,"My GoVideo DVR 4300 went bad within 6 months after purchase from Radio Shack. Most of the warranty had already expired. The unit developed severe VCR tracking problems, resulting in unwatchable portions of recorded programs. It was sent to the shop three times and each time it was returned with the same problems. It is by far the worst electronic device I ever purchased. I have gone back to my old (20 years) unit which works just fine, even if the technology is outdated."
2,Very Loud,"I bought this unit to save space .. .I wish I wouldn't have. After hooking up the unit, I found it was extremely loud when running--both DVD's and VCR tapes. Hence, I returned it for another one. What happened? The same thing . . .terribly loud. I would not recommend this brand. In fact, I am almost considering buying two separate units for my bedroom. It appears as if almost all of the combo units on the markets are having problems. If anyone else finds a good one, I would like to know!"
1,Where were the honest reviews when I was shopping???,"What a present. What a disappointment. Go Video, you should be ashamed. This player has known defects, and you have to know it. As with others who have posted, the unit worked fine playing the first DVD, but after the first, the picture froze, and when it finally advanced, it jumped around like a jumping bean. ... This is a gift giver's worst nightmare. I won't make this mistake again."
1,Taking the second one back!,"I purchased this machine at Costco. Worked fine playing the first DVD. Subsequently, it played the same scene over and over and wouldn't advance to the next scene. It also had a ""jumpy"" picture. I thought it was just a bad one so I took it back and got another. Played the first two DVD's fine and now the picture is jumping just like the last time! It goes back tomorrow and I'm getting another brand."
2,DVR4300-VCR TOO NOISY,VCR IS TOO NOISY. THE UNIT IS BEING RETURNED. READ AN EARLIER REVIEW REGARDING THIS PROBLEM.
3,Not for fussy kitties,"I'm sure this food is great for some kitties, but my two mostly lick up the gravy and leave the ""slices"" of turkey in their bowls....then they try to muscle in on the dogs food. We switched them to the pate style turkey & giblets dinner and it's working out much better. The pate style is also much easier to portion out if you're trying to feed two at once."
3,a little on the short side,"Stylish ipod protector. When my ipod video is inserted, sock is a little short (top of screen is exposed). Would be a ton better if it actually pulled up past the screen at least an inch or so, that way I could put my headphones in the bottom of the sock and still have full protection of my ipod. Also a little expensive for a piece of strechy material."
2,Worm Farm,"This worm farm was interesting put together, but be warned it is extremely flimsy. It is made from styroam and plastic and is not very portable. The mail-in certificate for worms as advertised is misleading - you have to pay additional money to get a kit. It is cheaper to go to a bait store and buy nightcrawlers to put in the container. This lasted about a month at my house and I ended up tossing it in the garbage. Very cheaply made and not worth what you pay for it. You could make your own."
3,WormVue Wonders,"I purchased this for my 5yr. old grandson for Christmas last year and he was thrilled with it. By the end of the day he could label all parts of a worm and was studying the included booklet with great interest.The worms were ordered and arrived alive and well. After 5 months, however, none of the worms had yet become visible. Thinking they were dead, his mother convinced him to empty the container. There were the worms, in perfect health! He released them to the backyard garden and goes to visit them daily.I was very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Worms not visible!,"The children's area of our museum has this toy. They keep healthy worms in it at all times (I asked). However, we have yet to see a single worm and we check every time we go (we've been doing this for over 2 years). The worms never bore near the sides.The toy is also cheaply made, the area in the picture you see that looks like rock is styrofoam. It isn't very big. And the sides scratch easily. The dark covers on either side are cheap cardboard and don't last long either. Our museum attendants have had to replace them with thick black cardboard pieces. Even with the thicker, darker covers against the plastic sides, the worms won't dig near the sides.This toy is a good concept, but poorly done and a total waste of money."
1,garbage,"this is the worst toy ive ever bought, first its made of styrofoam and nothing fits together right i put worms in it the first day for my child and by that night three or four worms were able to crawl out and get onto the floor, it is impossible to seal and is complete garbage!"
4,Another Winner from Writer's Digest Books,"Raymond Obstfeld provides the writer with essential guidelines to creating memorable unforgettable scenes in his book ""Novelist's Essential Guide to Crafting Scenes."" His topics include: Point of view, focus, characterization, plot, theme, structure, setting, and revision.Among other things, I particularly enjoyed his:* Descriptive Chapter Titles in the Table of Contents* The Format of the Book* The Practical Nature of the Author's Tips* The Instant Workshop Focus Exercises* Alternative Examples* Quotations from Legendary Writers* Invaluable InstructionI plan to keep this valuable reference tool handy for ready access to implement Obstfeld's ideas: To improve my writing skills and to help me develop my current writing projects."
5,Scottish rock,"I just loved this cd the very first time I heard it. I had heard a cut from a friend's mix called, God. It made me want to get the whole cd and it is certainly a winner! Every cut is just wonderful and exactly what I was looking for. If you like the scottish theme, bagpipes and rock and violin you won't be disappointed in this selection."
1,RIP OFF!,THE PRICE AND PART NUMBER SUGGEST THAT IT IS A STANDARD 4 PACK OF WR8CP SPARK PLUGS. WHAT I RECEIVED WAS A SINGLE SPARK PLUG NOT A FOUR PACK! THIS WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE SPARK PLUG I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. COMPLETE AND TOTAL RIP OFF!
5,Terrific timer,"This timer is very convenient. While the set-up is easy enough (for most home handymen) I had a contactor install it during a renovation. I use it to activate outdoor entryway lights. If I choose to shut them off before the ""off"" time is reached the timer re-sets and cycles on at the pre-programmed time the following day. There are seven different programs so there can be a variety of ""ON"" ""OFF"" cycles."
3,watch minimum load!,"Note this particular time WILL NOT WORK unless the load is at least 40W- which could be a problem with CCFL bulbs. I ordered the timer, and this warning is prominent on the back of the package, but not clear in the Amazon product description."
5,Excellent Timer,"It works flawlessly. I installed 3 with no issue. Fitted perfect in the box, wiring was easy and is easy to program. Great for lights coming on/off when you are away or arrive/depart in the dark."
3,L.E.D. Gripe,Will not work on low-wattage L.E.D. Bulbs -- flickers or refuses to turn off completely. The manufacturer should state this on the box.
4,"Nothing special, but it has worked well so far.","I don't have much to say about it, but it works well for my needs."
3,Works Well,"The installation was fairly straight forward and installed well. The basic operation of the timer works well. However, I had just installed another brand which had a couple of features that I like much better. There is no back light on the settings thus requiring one to use a flashight in low lighted areas to read the info in the setting window. My other timer has a red light that turns on when the lights are on. This timer has no indicater light and the outside lights could be on or not and one would never know except for opening the door and going outside. I installed the timers to keep my outside christmas lights lit while I was on vacation. The timer worked without a problem. Perhaps there is an upgrade to this timer that offers the two features that I miss."
3,not sure if it works,"I got my old light switch out to find that I only had one white wire connected comming into the switch, so this would not work...needs 2 white wires commin in. You might want to check this out first."
3,"Good switch, but item not as pictured/described","This switch, shown to be an Aube-branded electronic timer made by Honeywell, is a great product. But if you order it, you'll receive a different switch: the Honeywell EconoSwitch RPLS530A, which is identical in all but appearance, having the Honeywell logo printed on the switch cover.Is this a problem? It was for me: I didn't want the Honeywell name prominently displayed on my Decora switchbank, and if I had I would have ordered the Honeywell switch directly from Amazon for a buck-and-a-half less. So back it went. To their credit, the seller (WRM) and Amazon issued a full refund.Anyway, if you do decide to buy one of these switches -- the Aube is still offered by another Amazon vendor -- you'll be pleased. They're well-designed, reliable, and easy to install and use."
1,POS!!,This thing is TOTAL JUNK. Do not buy. It's a 1980's remnant. Amazon should not sell products this bad.
1,Hartz UltraGuard Rid Flea & Tick Shampoo for Dogs with Oatmeal 18oz,Not enough lather to soap up my dog whole body with out using half the bottle. It make the bath a very long process the get the dog fully washed
3,Smoe flees gone.,"Did'nt work as good as I hoped. I did see a few of flees in the tub when I was done, but there were still lots more. smelled nice though."
4,the pom doesn't love it,"not the best smelling product, but it seems to help with the tick problem down in Florida; the dog doesn't love it, but tollerates it"
5,HARTZ ULTRAGUARD RID FLEA & TICK SHAMPOO FOR DOGS WITH OATMEAL 180Z REALLY DOES WORK!!!!,THIS SHAMPOO REALLY DOES WORK!! I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT. IT HELPS WITH FLEA BITES AND FLEAS. IT ALSO HAS OATMEAL IN IT WHICH IS REALLY GREAT BECAUSE MY DOG HAS SENSITIVE SKIN AND THE OATMEAL DOESNT DRY OUT HIS SKIN.. THE SMELL OF THE SHAMPOO ISNT STRONG BUT IT WILL STILL WASH BAD ODOR OFF OF YOUR DOG FOR SURE. THIS SHAMPOO WOULD BE JUST PERFECT IF THE SCENT OF THE SHAMPOO WAS MUCH STRONGER. I REALLY LOVE BATHING MY DOG WITH THIS SHAMPOO AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.
1,Nope,This product was runny. It did not remove all fleas. I have to use a ton of product to wash my Yorkie. I will never but this online again. I have owned and washed dogs for over 20 years and have never used such a runny product. I am so surprised by Hartz on this one.
2,fleas still there,"I read reviews before I purchased this product and was hoping it would get rid of fleas from my dog. But after I shampooed her with this product over a month or so, she still scratching. I think fleas still there. I gave two stars because in the beginning of using this product, the scratching was reduced but after awhile, she still itched."
1,Gross vanilla scent!,"Nowhere in the description of this product does it mention that this shampoo is vanilla scented. It's disgusting, my dog wouldn't be caught dead smelling like this shampoo! Hard to say what's worse: the smell of this shampoo, or the fleas..."
5,"A real page turner, couldn't put it down","The best sci-fi who-done-it I have read since ""The City And The City"". Better than 99% of the sub $10.00 ebooks out there. This is a writer who knows his craft, and the power of economical writing. That is, he keeps what helps drive the story and character development, and leaves out the fluff. I have just ordered the second book of the series. I wish there were (hope there will be) more in the series."
2,Not my kind of reading,Well done but I couldn't my get my brain into it. May try again later in a few months.
3,Really just okay.,I have read many books about time travel and I really enjoy sci-fi. I found this one far to confusing and the central plot became rather secondary to everything else. It seemed to me that the author knew what was happening but didn't realise that the readers needed more information. Glad I didn't pay for it and I would definitely not read any sequels.
3,Don't Take Your Snake For a Stroll,"A fun book for readers that are a bit older. My 4 and 5 year old enjoy the story, but don't get the humor regarding each animal. I think this is great for first grade and up. When I read this at elementary school story time, it gets the best reaction from the first and second graders."
1,Dictionary of Islamic Terms - Concise? -- YEAH RiiiiGHT!,WHERE are the ENGLISH WORDS?You give the ENGLISH WORD FIRST -- THEN you can give the Arabic words.You give the ENGLISH MEANING but NOT the ENGLISH WORD??GOOD GRIEF! LAMEST ENGLISH DICTONARY EVER! EVER! EVER!DON'T YOU KNOW that when you are giving the ENGLISH translation of the DEFINITION you ALSO SHOULD GIVE THE ENGLISH WORD!!???!!SHEESH! WORST DICTIONARY EVER!I AM SENDING THIS BACK! HORRIBLE BOOK!
4,An enjoyable read,"The author is very skilled with her characterizations, and the dialogue is reminiscent of the banter of other period novels. The humor was delightful. As for the heroine going through many stages of emotions, I would be sorely dissapointed in one of these types of books that didn't have this gamut of emotion. I look forward to her next book (and if you find one in the trash, keep it for a real reader.)"
2,A Dilemma,"I found myself puzzled that this book was ever listed as a Regency. It would have worked fine set in San Francisco, but certanly not in Regency England. An Actress at Almacks? A debutante in a red evening gown? Even Miss Scarlett wouldn't do that.The writing was fine and dialogue snappy, but the inconsistant details made it difficult to lose myself in the story. As someone else mentioned, perhaps a beta reader more familar with the mores of the time wouldn't be out of line."
1,Didn't work and smelled bad.,"I used this product exactly as the directions said. I found it to be very stinky, as you have to mix the granules with canned food. Also, it didn't work, so now I have ordered another product called Worm X Plus. This is supposed to be effective, and used to only be available by prescription. It is in liver flavored pill form, and one dose is supposed to work."
1,pretty but to heavy,this watch was very pretty but the watch itself was way to heavy for the band. It would fall under your wrist and not stay upright and I wanted the watch face to be on top to show it off.
5,Expect nothing less from the east coast.,Forever I Burn truly shows what the east coast of the u s of a has to offer. Beings the first time i heard them was the first time i saw them. instant love. broken mirrors is the best track on this cd. enjoy!
1,The dentate Gyrus and role in Sizure,"The dentate Gyrus and role in Sizures (Epilepsy Research Suplement, n 7) by Charles e. Ribak, et al"
2,impossible to zero-balance,impossible to zero-balance..i get it zero and retest about 3 times and its off..or get it zero and then try to do powder and get it dead on and then off...dont have the patience for it after trying to get it to work for 3 days...all other lee tools work well just not this one
2,Accurate.......for those with endless patience.,"Does it do what it is supposed to? YES. BUT I agree with the other reviewer- time consuming to set up, I was trying to be cheap....I took it back, bought a digital....problem solved, so save your pennies unless you have unlimited time to fiddle with this one and ""hope"" which is a bad idea for handloaders......"
3,Acceptable as a last resort,"If you are living in a post apocalyptic world where all electricity and batteries are gone and there is no way on the earth that you can obtain a digital scale, then yes this is an accurate and reliable powder measure. And that's really the only time I can ever see using this thing. It is agonizingly slow to use and its accuracy and consistency depend on too many other factors. Its good as a back up, you know, in case the world ends and you're still reloading...but otherwise I can't see how anyone would choose this instead of a digital scale."
2,I did love the cover!!!,"But that was the only thing about this book I liked. I do like time travels if they are done well. Lets just say this was not one of them. From what i could guess by other reviews this was a funny book - I think I read a different book than everyone else or I have no sense of humor.The characters bored me , the book was so blah, blah that I had to skim the pages just to get to the end. Please save your money."
1,Bad buy,"The DVD/CD player is a bad buy. The sound amplifier on the DVD player does not work. The nearest ""authorized"" repair shop is an hour's drive away from where I live. I do not recommend this product or manufacturer to anyone."
1,Audio Is Horrible.,The audio is horrible and I have returned this product. The manufacturer has informed me that I received a defective product. The customer service is horrible as well. They bounce you around from number to number.
4,Go Video Is a GO,"GoVideo is making a name for itself. My friend has this combo DVD/VCR unit and it works pretty well from what I saw. The DVD side looked good and functioned well. You get the standard DVD options that you get on most units. The VCR records and plays back in HiFi. Most pre-recorded tapes looked good. Recorded pictures on this unit looked good too. The picture looked good for VHS. VHS is VHS, what else can you say. It has A/V inputs and is programmable with on-screen features. You really can't go wrong at this price. It is very affordable and a nice compact unit."
1,REVIEW DV2130 PRODUCT CAPABILITY,"I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH GOVIDEO AND I TOOK A CHANCE IN PURCHASINGA DVD/VHS PLAYER DV2130. MY FIRST DISATISFACTION WAS UPON OPENING THE BOX AND SEEING THE PAPER THAT SAYS DO NOT RETURN TO THE PLACE OF PURCHASE BUT CALL OR EMAIL GOVIDEO. BUT I WAS CONFIDENT THAT ALL WOULD BE WELL. I HAVE PLAYED ONLY TWO VHS TAPES IN MY NEW PLAYER WHICH I PURCHASED ONLY 4 DAYS AGO AND THE THING COULD HAVE BURNED MY HOUSE DOWN FROM THE EXTREME HEAT IT PRODUCED. I HAVE EMAILED BECAUSE THE SUPPORT LINES ARE CLOSED ON WEEKENDS. I WILL RAISE EXTREME PROBLEMS IF MY MACHINE IS NOT REPLACED. I WILL LET YOU KNOW MY RESULTS. FROM THE OTHER REVIEWS I SAY ""DON'T"" GOVIDEO. GO TO NAME YOU KNOW AND TRUST. AND A STORE THAT WILL TAKE THE PRODUCT BACK."
2,This One Isn't Worth The Money!,"This was a Christmas present for my 2 daughters. Thinking it would be perfect because it played both vhs and dvd movies. Don't let the low or sales prices fool you! It is so noisy when it is playing. It's high pitch noice is so loud, I can even hear it in another room. My daughters refuse to watch it. ... To say the least I am very disappointed in this product."
3,Decent space saver but limited features,"The DVD player in this dual deck is OK, on a par withlower-end budget players. The VCR in this deck is OK, ona par with lower-end budget VCRs. So far, so fair.BUT the recorder won't record any DVD that is Macrovisionencoded (which is most of them), so don't expect to use thisas a one stop way to record your DVDs. The DVD player alsodoesn't play VCDs or SVCDs. So it has basic functionality,but little more.Overall, this is useful for those who want both a DVDplayer and a VCR, and who want to save a bit of space. But atthe price you could purchase a better DVD player and a betterVCR separately. So this only makes sense for those who needto save the space.David"
2,I own this player,I bought this player about 6 month ago. It worked great at first but now the dvd portion skips and wont play sometimes. the vcr portion has horrible tracking problems and at one point quit working all together. Most of the time it auto tracks constanty and messes up the image. If I had it to do over I would not buy this player.
2,VERY POOR SOUND,I PURCHASED THIS UNIT AND HAVE EMAILED THE MANUFACTURER TWICE (WITH NO REPLY) COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE SOUND VOLUME ON DVD PLAYBACK IS ALMOST INAUDIBLE!
4,FBI EXAM,I took the FBI Exam this morning 3/27/2001. This book was a very good aid in studying. The practice tests were very helpful study aids prior to the actual exam.
2,"Too old, information is not relevant.","The information is way outdated. The only thing I found beneficial was some of the exam questions, however only about a fourth is relevant these days as the exam has shifted gears and is more looked upon at critical thinking/analysis and behavioral type assessments."
1,Completely Useless,I can't believe they are still selling this book. The strategies and practice tests are nothing like the actual test. You'd be better off buying a LSAT or GMAT test book and running through the arguments/critical thinking sections.Please discontinue this book!
2,Useful but disappointing.,"Bought this book hoping for some useful information on the type questions asked phase 1 and phase 2 Special agent testing portions. This book appears to be a collection of police tests or practice exams strung together in sort of a mismatched manner. There is no table of contents or Index. There is no sample interview questions, there are no common pitfalls or other useful suggestions. Some of the sample tests might be relative to the phase 1 test, and the writing refresher at the back of the book should be useful for the phase 2. However I think people will find more benefit in studying LSAT Logical Reasoning questions off the internet."
5,Surprisingly great,"I grew up breathing Blondie. There's no band whose music I know any better, and I consider this to be the best, most fun tribute album I know. I absolutely can't stand almost any other I've ever heard, but I've been listening to this one a lot.Of course, none of them bests Blondie, but The Short Fuses' ""Maria"" comes close. Tuuli's ""Accidents Never Happen"" is crunchily bratty, and High School Sweethearts' ""Living in the Real World"" is its equal...but Debbie tore both those vocals up more herself.I love it. And I can't believe I'm saying that about a cash-in tribute record."
2,No more Blondie Tribute albums ever.... PLEASE!!!!,"First of all I am a huge Blondie FANATIC--I have almost everything EVER recorded on CD/LP/CS/DVD/VID/VCD etc. I have this an some other tribute albums and all I have to say is LISTEN to the sound clips EVERYONE--I did not have that option when I purchased this CD. I don't know why I bought it, maybe a weak moment (cuz I have to have everything even remotely related to Blondie), but TRUST ME this CD sucks. There are a couple of bright spots, original even, but overall it leaves one with the impression of ""Why did they bother?"". Stick to the original, you won't regret it."
1,1 star for the fact that it's Blondie related,"Don't be fooled! This Album SUCKS!It was given one star for the fact that it's blondie related and it's neat to hear most of the more rare Blondie songs done in a ""new"" manner.It says Blondie Tribute and is called: How Many Bands Does It Take to Screw up a Blondie Tribute?Answer: ONE There is only one woman singing all 22 tracks under the disguise as 22 bands. It is apparent in the names that were chosen for the bands that they just pulled it out of a hat.Chris Stein nor any other band member has given any sort of review on this. This was made purely for the fact that at it's time of release Tribute CD's were all the rage for Big artists.IF YOU WANT A REAL BLONDIE TRIBUTE ALBUM check out ""Platinum Girl"". at least they actually have real artists and bands covering blondie."
3,Not quite spiritual,"This book is interesting reading because the author is forthright and humorous.Since he writes about two eras, one in 1975 and the next in 1992, we do get to compare the changes in the spiritual world.I am surprised at his devotion to Sathya Baba to such a high degree in 1975 byt somehow did not try to pursue for the next 17 years.Some of his observations are platitudinous.Like many of the travel writers,including Paul Theroux,he also stays in very poor hotels paying 50 cents rent and then complains about cockroaches and lizards.And then he stays in the Taj Hotel and keeps drinking tea which at Taj costs more than 50 cents per cup!There are several inconsistent statements as well as contradictory ones. Even though he claims to be a great lover of India,some of his statements are not credible.In every conversation with the Indians,there is an air of elitist posture. William Dalrymple is a much better travel writer who searches more into the meaning of India."
5,A truly remarkable book!,"This is the third book by author Roberts which I have read, and as with his other works, it does not disappoint. He has a remarkable talent for writing about the places he visits, not only from a travelers perspective, but is also able to delve into the psychology of the peoples he writes about. His historical vignettes coupled with his ability to describe current events makes his books a joy to read. I can hardly wait for the next one on Iraq to be published."
4,Beethoven DVD,"I purchased the dvd for my 5 year old son who loves classical music. The content was above his level and there was not much in the way of actual music pieces being performed, but the information and content was very interesting on an adult level. The optional part of the specific musical compositions was also interesting, but didn't perform pieces of music individually. Overall this is a good 35 minutes for someone who wants to know about the artist, but not something I would watch over and over again."
1,StreetGlow is color blind!!!,This Hott Wirez is not purple but is instead a funky pink color. These manufactures need to look at an actual color chart before stating the actual color on the package! I have not seen an actual purple neon wire made since the one I bought from Walmart 3 years ago and they don't carry it anymore.
4,If you loved the book of the same name and didn't want it to end ....,".... and if you found yourself asking for more, then this audio programme is for you. The book packs so much information in about a 100 pages. This CD set expands on the key concepts. The narration is by the author himself.I bought this as I was eager to get the 'Focus Tool' that Mr. Duncan developed for enhancing our present moment awareness practice. I heard that the tool was being sold with this programme. Till date, I haven't found it anywhere. But I can manage with a simple mobile phone that has alarm facility.Please note that the last CD in this programme is a great relaxation CD full of nature sound tracks. You'll love it!"
5,Informative!!,"An excellent book which covers all aspects of this extraordinary man's life and work. Essentiall it covers everything! Not too deep in technical detail but with such a wide scope, it does justice to the material. An excellent book for anyone interested in conservation and nature. Highly recommended!"
5,This is big but very readable,"Viktor Schauberger's works are clearly synthesised into a hard ot put down volume encompasing earth energies, water, plants, soil, and free energy devices. A really big book - rewriting our known science texts. Open your mind and read it - i am sure it will challenge your notions of the world. A good primer for reading more of Schauberger's works."
1,Paperback version,"Please be aware all who are buying this book. The paperback version they give here on amazon is not the actual textbook. It is an All-In-One student workbook. If you are looking to get the actual textbook the only option is the hardback version. Amazon did not label that the paperback was different from the textbook, they call both books the exact same thing. They should have included in the title that it was a workbook."
2,What did he say?,"I got this because I have heard a lot of good things about tae bo. I thought maybe something new for the lower body (I normally do The Firm) and it was only half an hour. But I could not hear a word the man said because of all the background noise, which did not spurn me on but irritated me. I had the volume up as much as it could go but I still could not hear. It's kind of necessary to hear how to do the move properly so you don't hurt yourself and so that you get the results you want.I had my eyes pasted on the tv and to this day, I have an idea of what they are doing, but I don't feel like it's working because I'm sure I'm not doing it properly to get the full effect. Billy, tell those people to pipe down please."
2,SHUT UP BILLY!!!,"Don't get me wrong, the workouts are great and they really work. Billy is just sooooo annoying in the videos. He just doesn't shut up. He constantly repeats the same thing over and over again. Just demonstrate the different moves and close your yap. His constant talking even affects the balance of the workouts - sometimes your are doing 5 reps on the left side and only 3 on the right because he is constantly talking and loses track of the workout.Thank the lord for the MUTE button!!"
4,Good 30 Minute Workout...,"I'm a huge Taebo fan and have been doing it on and off for about eight years. A few months after having my daughter, I decided it was time to up my workouts and turned once again to Taebo. I bought this video after starting out with the Taebo Cardio video. This video is very fast paced and wonderful for a quick, but effective workout. It's divided into abs, upper body, lower body and then an all body segment. The all body segment is very fast paced and will get your heart rate up. The only two negative comments I have; but are very typical of Taebo, are; his counting is uneven (he'll do two sets on one side and then four on the next) and there are a couple exercises where I feel that I'm a little ""out of control"" when he has you pick up the pace. Other than that, I can't complain because it's a great cardio workout in just 30 minutes."
1,This is not a circuit training video,"I bought this video along with BB's regular Cardio Tae Bo, and I was very disappointed. The other Cardio Tae Bo is much better; I recommend buying that one instead. This Cardio Circuit is literally the exact same Tae Bo moves as the other video, only faster and without stopping. There is no slow speed to start; they just launch right into the routine. I also have to say that there were WAY too many people in the background of this video - it is so distracting and you can barely hear Billy speaking. If you like BB Tae Bo, I highly recommend getting his regular cardio video, not this one."
2,I find it boring,I'm a huge Billy fan. I've been doing Tae Bo for years. However I love the original Tae Bo basic workout on VHS & I have never found one available on DVD that equals it (IMO) This one is very high impact. He does this move where he stands still & twists at the waist. It's done for at least half the video. It's very boring & not good for your spine. He will do a set of moves & then go back to that insanely boring twisting. The video doesn't really get my heart rate up & it doesn't keep my interest. With the basic video he would do a set of moves & then go back to a boxing footwork type move. Much more interesting. I will keep searching for a better Tae Bo because I do love Billy
4,A Good Jazz Organ CD,"I have this CD. It's a good jazz organ trio CD. Joey and 2 other Italian musicians, play some all time Italian favorites, jazz style. I enjoyed it very much. If you're a Joey Defrancesco fan, then add this CD to your collection."
4,Works Great For What We Need It For,We are a small firearms manufacturing company and specialize in Saiga conversions. BATFE regulations state that all firearms modified by us must be permanently marked. This little unit can burn our logo into BARE Russian steel in about 20 seconds about 3mm deep. The mark holds up well even after coating the receivers. You can easily see our logo and read our name and address. We bought the entire kit that included the stencil maker which works great!Now the down side. This kit has a learning curve. Not for black marks but for the deep permanent marking you need to practice to get the time down and keep your marks crisp and readable. The instructions are not the best in the wold for these kinds of marks. For the money though this was the best option for us.
3,Could have tasted better...,"If you are an Indian, you are not gonna be excited about it. To their credit, the ingredients were very fresh. But the quantity can be just enough for one.Not sure I would buy again."
4,Tasty Bite is aptly named,"This was really yummy, mildly spicy so that I could add hot sauce as needed, and actually it was good hot or cold. I love this stuff with brown basmati rice cooked in my rice cooker, but I also like it with whole-grain crackers when I just don't feel like cooking."
4,Very good but wish it were a little spicier,"I was recently introduced to Tasty Bite entrees and have stockpiled my office with a number of different varieties (so expect to see quite a few reviews). I'm not one for instant meals but I've made an exception for Tasty Bite because I recognize all of the ingredients used, they're vegetarian (I'm not a vegetarian but I prefer to eat meat that's been just prepared), MSG and Preservative Free and the convenience can't be beat. Since I eat these in the office when I haven't had the time to prepare anything else or go out for lunch, I mostly enjoy them as soups though I believe most are meant to be served on rice. The Janipur Vegetables are very good and I love the Paneer Cheese cubes :). I just wish that this dish were a little spicier to suit my taste. I'll definitely be purchasing this one again."
2,Not that great,"This item has plenty of vegetables, but for some reason, doesn't taste great. When I bought this item, I was looking forward to have more of ""paneer"", or Indian cottage cheese, but there are hardly any cubes of paneer in this dish. So, the image of this dish shown on cover is pretty misleading. This dish is primarily made of beans, peas, carrots and some very hard potatoes. This dish is more expensive than some other packed Indian food on sale and frankly, the price of dish is not at all reasonable."
5,Great Quick Dish,"This stuff is great for an on the run meal or quick dinner. For those nights when you get home late and want something quick, this stuff works great on rice. Its actually somewhat healthy, pretty tastey and filling. Also if you need a quick meal for work, you can take some rice, mix it together, microwave, and have an instant lunch. That it better than most frozen meals and way cheaper."
3,Westin Running Board Lights,I purchased my Westin running boards approximately 2 years ago but I had one light go bad and unfortunately I was unable to just get one replacement and had to get the whole kit with all the wiring and four lights hopefully I will not have anymore problems if so I still have three spares. I like the lights but Westin should make available replacement lights without having to purchase the entire kit. As far as the seller and Amazon I rate them 5 stars. I gave this item 3 stars only because Westin does not sell one replacement you have to buy this light kit if you have a light go bad.
2,alright....but not great,"The case doesnt really fit that well, its a little too big and it doesnt really stay put on the phone. If you can look past all of that, then it is great for protecting such an expensive phone. but i wish it fit better, i had to cut my a little bit to fit around the navigation buttons under the screen..."
4,Very good protection for my Treo,This silicone skin case protects my cell phone while still allowing to fit the Treo in the leather case.I just would love if could protect the screen either.
3,Silicone Skin Case,"Nice idea, but the silicone skin case does not fit the Palm Treo 700p nearly as tight and as well as I expected. The Treo 700p will not fit in any type of carrier or holder with the skin case on. The skin case fits nice and tight onto the phone, but it is not tight around the screen and the keyboard and it tends to catch on your belt, your clothing and other things, which causes the skin to stretch around that area and I didn't like that. Not a bad product, just not as great as I expected."
2,okay,this thing is ok it was a gift for my sister and she said it doesnt really stay on its a little loose not snug like some other ones but she still has it on and it still is ok for protection.
2,Not all its cracked up to be,Product has a loose fit and could use a better design on the top part of the skin. Not too bad for the cost but not what I had expected/wanted.
3,Too much plastic,"I expected a watch more sofisticated for 600 USD. I think Tiger W. does not use this one, even getting paid !"
3,Tag Heuer F1 Chronograph,"My reason for the low rating is the condition in which the watch was received from Jewels Warehouse. 6 weeks after lodging my complaint via Amazon and with the company direct no communication has been received back which means to me they cannot be bothered with after sales. I would definitley purchase from Amazon again, but not Jewels Warehouse purely based on the condition of the watch and the non existent after sales service."
5,relevance to this new age,"I LOVE the Cd and the Chipmunks! they brought back so many memories of my childhood. I hope the Chipmunks' marketers can find ways to reach today's children and give the Chipmunks the relevance they deserve, in a new era."
5,"Excellent and Cute..Alvin, I Love you!","The cd is fantastic, they remain as skweeky! What I was looking for though, was most of the songs they sing on the show. I Love it, I Love it, I Love it!! mmmmmua!!!Magnificent!"
4,"Standard Blues, but different","This is the Badman's second CD that I know of. Its 13 songs are new and original, while maintaining the Blues tradition. They are catchy enough to get stuck in your head. What stands out for me on this CD is Luther's distinctive vocal style that you won't find anywhere else.Luther has a passion for the blues, and it is clearly evident in this effort. Give it a try, you won't be sorry."
5,BUY! I love them! I own 20 racks at least.,I love these shoe racks! We have them stack in the garage because we are running out of room in our closets. You can stack them as high as you like and very sturdy compare to the other plastic ones.
2,OK if you only wear high heels,"I bought this rack because I thought it would be functional and chic-looking. It does look nice compared to other shoe racks, but functionality is terrible. It works great for high heels that hook themselves on the rungs, but any other shoes with flat or simi-flat soles just slide right off."
2,Sub-par cocktail shaker,"I used this shaker set for a little while. You COULD get it to seal if you really JAMMED it in there, but my biggest complaint is the strength of the glass. Seemed okay until I washed it (under cold water), put it down to let it dry only to return and see a giant crack down the side. The thing was split in two, was pretty pissed. Boston shaker glasses are supposed to be tempered to resist chipping and cracking, but this one clearly doesn't cut the cake. Well actually I could cut a cake with the giant glass shard that fell off it. Boo, Craphalon."
2,can we say...Pink Floyd?,"I got this CD with a collection for x-mas when it came out from waveform.I tried to like it, but tried to get rid of it several times and held on to it. Well I took it out again just now and listened to it one more time. These guys are trying to be pink floyd. Since we already have a pink floyd why should we have an imitator?could do without the vocals. This one will be in the next stack to go to the resale shop. Save your money and buy Thievery corp or something else."
3,A good backup,I have to say that this is good back up material. If you're not the very creative type and looking for material already formatted then this may be for you. There is not a lot to it; I wished I had a chance to preview it before I purchased it.
2,Broken Easily,I bought my daughter the Harry and Hermoine dolls. One hour out of the box my daughter dropped Hermoine on the wood floor and her leg snapped off. I was able to super glue it back on but still think they are not very well made. I wouldn't recommend them but my daughter still things they are great.
3,enjoyable,"an enjoyable album from the boys. It falls short of masterpiece by a goo d bit though. Highlights include 'rhyme' 'no glamour for willi' and shane. There are no big long guitar solos, just small and medium ones. If you are a television fan you should get it, that's the bottom line. Thank you"
3,tv makes your brian rot,"this album's got some good complex guitar riff based songs on it, but for some reason i usually get bored before the end of it. not sure why. i ought to listen again but i seem to recall that ""call mr. lee"" is one of the sweeter songs on it. this is not as good as their early records, but still an above average release i'd say."
5,This is way more than 5 stars!!,"If you ABSOLUTELY LOVE HANSON, you'd better get this CD, because this CD ROCKS! I love all of Hanson's songs! Their songs' are a major part of me! I can relate to almost all of them! Irene Hanson"
5,Amazing Performers.,"This LP is amazing. Hamilton has produced a fine crew of talented musicians. In addition to their constructive sound, their live performances are unrivalled. I suggest to see them when you have the opportunity to, because before long, their ticket prices will soar. Casbah Hamilton what!"
5,Excellent all round math book,"I have used mostly A Beka curriculum for my son. This math book covers topics such as banking, investments, trig, and algebra to name a few. This book shows the steps so well that my son seldom ever asked me for help. I highly recommend this book for a solid foundation of mathematics."
3,Easier to balance on than I was hoping.,I thought (and was hoping) that it was going to be more challenging to stand on. I think I'll use it more once I buy a book or video on all of the different things you can use it for.
4,Greatful Band.. I hope they came to europe very soon..,I've listened alone and frustrated at first and i have to say that the guys really rock! Ocean is also a very nice song. I think they play good songs.If you like Creed and Tool you liked downface too...Greetings from Austria..
3,asdf,"I'm not much of a fan of Shady View Terrace, but the last 3 lawrence arms songs rock on this CD. ""A Toast"" is my favorite song brenden has ever written. Well worth the money if it's 10 bucks or less, otherwise just download the songs. PEace"
2,Get Up and Move Around,"The premise of this video is that you can move to the beat of the music; here are four steps (plus the underarm turn and the dip) to help you move. The steps work pretty well when you hear music and you want to move your feet while dancing with a partner. The DVD demonstrates the Box Step, Turning Box Step, Hesitation Step and the Whisk Pattern. It alleges to demonstrate steps of the Waltz, Foxtrot, Merengue, Sway, Samba and Rumba. (I'm sure all of those dances use one of the demonstrated moves; that's all I will say for a rating of two stars.) There is a music CD of twelve songs with the dance they demonstrate clearly labeled. If there is only room for one instructional DVD about Ballroom Dancing in your budget, this is enough."
1,Ballroom Dancing,"Do not like the product. Old fashion ballroom dancing, not the modern 2009 type my friends are doing."
3,Great Introduction To Ballroom Dancing,"I got this DVD as a birthday present. It individually teaches the male and female dance parts, then puts them together. It first teaches a box step, turning box, as well as different variations. Then it shows how some of the moves apply to the waltz, rumba, and other dances. It's easy to learn, and it's not complicated to do. This is a good DVD to get started learning ballroom dancing."
4,Never trust a chicken,"Look out! When impeachable sources Pete the Barncat and J.T. Cluck declare the sky ready to fall, it is up to The Head of Ranch Security to save the day. Or, not... Drover's leg did not even act up, but Hank barely escaped a serious bout with the broom. It was truly a day to be remembered...except for the problem with the hiccups. Oh, well... I missed the buzzards and the coyotes, but #45 was still a great Hank of fun. An entertaining series for all ages.l"
3,Not a lot of Da Vinci,"My 6-year-old boys love these books, but this title was disappointing. We wanted to learn more about Da Vinci, but look closely... this is Da Vinci AND HIS TIME. It's MOSTLY about his time and his contemporaries. So this is a disappointment because it isn't what we wanted or expected."
1,"A COMPLETE waste of time, effort, and $40","This ""DVD player"" was absolute garbage. I've had it for about a week now, and I can't believe how utterly useless it is. We've tried several times to get this thing working, and our efforts were clearly wasted. Brand new DVDs, JUST out of the case, skipped horribly if they played at all, and occaisionally the audio went out for no reason. It's going back tomorrow. I'll never trust a product by Memorex ever again, as my experience doesn't seem to be a unique one."
1,Awful,"-Loud whirs when trying to play a DVD-Weird errors (""i.e. ""No Disc"")-Half the time the sound doesn't work-Just stops working sometimesDefinitely do not recommend this DVD player"
1,No Luck So Far!,"This DVD player appears to have some technical problems. I followed the setup procedure for installing component video, and the instructions said to change the Video Out to Component. Unfortunately Video Out does not allow for changes. You cannot highlight it on the SetUp screen. I checked with the store that I purchased it and the sales associate had the same problem when he went to the setup screen. I can get a picture, but no sound. The next step would be to try S-Video, but since I have the component cables and want the better quality picture and audio that they supposedly provide, this may go back for another player. Maybe the low price tag was too good to be true for a progressive scan player!"
1,Don't buy Memorex,I had a Memorex DVD player for a little over a year. It was hardly used. One day it just kept spinning the DVD and would not load it. What a piece of junk.
1,Don't buy this,I don't really know what else to say but don't buy this. After a week it works worse than the DVD player that I needed to replace.
2,not for me,"many reviews say that this is good for everyone including beginners. i completely disagree. I'm not a yoga expert, but I have been doing yoga for about 7 months now and this yoga is way too advanced. Do not get this if you are a beginner!"
2,nah.,This didn't really do anything for me. It was hard to get into and not nearly as satisfying as Tae Bo.
1,too complicated demonstration too confusing,"I felt the demonstration was way too complicated, by the time I got it figured out I didn't even want to do it."
5,"good pace, nice mix of exercise","I read about this DVD in a gossip mag and saw that many celebrities used Cameron's teachings. I thought, why not try it and see if I can get a celebrity body. I had experience in yoga before doing this tape, but even if I did not, the poses were easy enough to follow along. I like the layout of exercises. We started with yoga, then martial arts and end with meditation. It is the perfect warm up, work out and cool down. I love the way Cameron takes time in between each exercises to ""find your breath"" rather than rush through things like most workout programs. I found it to be moderately challenging and I broke out in a good sweat. I think this is a great program and it is nice to do something different to make exercising more fun. Highly recommend!"
4,Yoga portion is difficult,"The concept is very good. I like variety. I found the yoga portion very difficult as I have NOT been exercising. The martial arts section was easier for me. Overall, I think this DVD would be challenging for someone who has NOT been exercising, but it is a good workout and you need to do the moves as best as you can."
4,Perfect Combination of Yoga and Martial Arts,"I have a bunch of other dvd's that I use for cardio, yoga and pilates. Budokon is good for strength, flexability and mental focus. I've been taking Karate at a studio for about 4 months and the techniques used in the martial arts segment of this DVD are very accurate and easy to follow. It's a great suppliment to my Karate training and to the other workout DVD's that I use. This Budokon DVD is also a great workout for those who are new to fitness and/or Martial Arts. If you're at an advanced fitness level, this DVD would still be a great mind/body workout to add to your routine. You'll get the benefits of yoga and martial arts training together in a quick workout."
3,no sweat,I like Cameron Shayne as an instructor and the way he teaches but the dvd is for a beginner only because if you want a good workout forget it. Just when you start to get going it is over. Even the meditation at the end is practically nothing. The concept of Budokon is good so he should make a serious dvd.
3,Is exactly what it says it is!,"I just finished doing the full workout. The cueing is excellent! I've been doing yoga for a few years but was new to the martial art part. I was able to do all the exercises with no problem... It was relaxing, energizing and felt great! I did feel the power! I am looking forward to doing the short workout with less instruction!"
4,Love It!,Budokon for beginners is just what I was looking for. A workout that relaxes and makes me sweat at the same time. I have slimmed down and feel realy centered.
3,Not as Impressed as I wanted to be,"I had high hopes for this DVD. However, if you are more than 15 lbs overweight (like me) and have the coordination of a wet noodle (like me) it may not impress you much. The triple punches at the start are hard enough to try and keep up with, when he went into the various kicks - I stopped trying and just watched. When he went into a skip and kick - I turned it off. It's just too high of a learning curve for me."
3,"Good, but kinda tough","This mixes classic yoga and powerful martial arts movements. It's designed to build strength and agility while improving mental focus. There are two complete Budokon workouts. I don't like the teachers style all that much, especially in the second routine in which theres less teaching than in the first. This is mainly lower body working out, and there are lots of controlled kicks etc that will work, but it takes a lot of practice to get the prescision. The workout ends with a bit of meditation. This isn't my favourite at all, I prefer something a little more cardio and more exciting. This doesn't do it for me."
2,Weak and outdated,"This book has two parts: one original half by Alex Wayman, one a translation of the French study from the beginning of the 20th century by Tajima. Neither is of great use or contemporary scholarly quality.The first half is devoted to the Mahavairocana Tantra (as it is known in Tibet and later India). The perennially confused and confusing Wayman does little to illuminate the interpretation of this text or its traditions.The latter was a groundbreaking study of the Mahavairocana Sutra (as it is known in Japan), by Tajima. Its scholarship is highly dated and the quality of the translation, filtered as it is through Chinese, Japanese, and then French into English, leaves much to be desired.Try Stephen Hodge's recent translation of the Mahavairocanatantra with Buddhaguhya's commentary if you are seeking a translation. Or Chikyo Yamamoto's translation from the Sino-Japanese side."
3,The most important text of esoteric Buddhism,"The Enlightenment of Vairocana and the Study of the Mahavairocana Sutra constitute probably the most imprtant text in Esoteric Buddhism. It is based on this text that Nagarjuna propagated the doctrine and created the Matrix and Diamond World Mandalas that Kobo Daishi brought back to Japan in the 9th century. It is basically a description of the two mandalas, how they should be set up, which deities should be placed in what position, and what their specific mantras and mudras are, for the purpose of worship, teaching initiates, and identifying with the nature of the buddhas. For the researcher, this is a real find; however, the book could use some illustrations and diagrams (perhaps the inclusion of the matrices) and the cover could be more attractive."
1,"bad, disk error! BOO :(","BOO, DISK ERROR, Can't listen to this gem of old time jazz music cd. The album art is quality tho."
5,Splendid Overview of British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars,"Richard O'Neill's coffee table book is a splendid, though terse, overview of the British Royal Navy during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. It does a fine job covering virtually every aspect, from the types of ships to their crews and various subjects such as punishment and entertainment available onshore and off by seamen. It is not the definitive word on the Royal Navy during this period, nor is it meant to be, since O'Neill spends much time relating the real history to the events chronicled in O'Brian's novels. May be regarded as an essential purchase by diehard fans of the Aubrey/Maturin series."
3,Do not read this book! Yet.,"This book is maddening. Yes, it is very cool, all the history you can take in. Nice pictures and what not.My BIG CONCERN is that the author has no clue. He puts spoilers in every nook and cranny of the book. Here is a made up example that recounts my experience: While giving the book a pre-bedtime read, I come across an interesting illustration, the caption reads something along the lines of ""The victorian sailor enjoyed drinking, too bad Jack Aubrey's favorite sailor dies from drinking in the book you are about to read."" or ""Spying in the Royal Navy was always a concern, for example, in the 100 days, Preserved Killick's mother turns out to be a spy for Spain.""No warning, momentus events and dark secrets get spilled at random."
4,Enhance O'Brian,"I enjoy reading this book along with O'Brian's opus. It is fairly basic, but provides a wonderful context for the tales, and has excellent illustrations."
1,This should not be a Kindle edition,"I'm sure this is a beautiful book with many gorgeous illustrations, but it should not be sold as a Kindle version because the illustrations cannot be deciphered on the Kindle, and the captions confuse the text."
2,Disappointing book,"I thought this book would have the kind of beautiful, meticulous paintings Geoff Hunt provided for cover art on the Aubrey-Maturin series. It didn't. If you want knowledge of the ships of the era, get the Geoff Hunt book.The illustrations in this books are mediocre to downright inferior compared to the work of Hunt: a number of landscapes portrayed from a distance, ships ditto, water colors artfully contrived but all without the details which convey the appearance of reality, details always present in the far better work of Geoff Hunt."
5,Patrick O'Brians Navy: The Illustrated Companion to Jack Aubrey's,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. I really only knew that he listed it on his wish list, but when he opened it, I knew I hit it right! He said, the rest of you go on with what you are doing. I'm going to read my book. I'm as happy as he is."
4,Good general book on 18th century navies,"No matter what naval fiction you may or may not read (I find Aubrey unreadable but enjoy Hornblower and Jack Aubrey) this is a good companion book for figuring out where the orlop is and what that silly looking triangular sail is all about. I can't say I learned much from reading it, but I've managed to figure out a lot over 50 years of reading naval history and fiction. If you are new to this stuff, it will save you a lot of time"
3,slightly disappointed,"As a great fan of Patrick O'Brian's writing, I had unrealistically high expectations for this book. It is a little light on details and failed to live up to my hopes and expectations. I still have it on my shelf, and will keep it. I just wanted more."
1,"Dim, didn't stick, dinged my laptop","I bought this thing to stick on the underside of the hutch over my desk. I was very disappointed in the dimness of the light. If there was another light on in the room, it was hard to tell that this one was on at all.The adhesive patches didn't stick for very long. Unfortunately, they decided to fail while my laptop screen was under the light. The falling light put a small permanent dent in my screen.I don't recommend this thing to anyone."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased 2 Rite Lites to use under my kitchen cabinets. The light output was not strong enough to assist in food prep or even read a recipe. Additionally, the batteries were drained very quickly so I would have to be replacing batteries all the time. I called the company to see if I could return them and was told no if I didn't have the original packaging -- even though I had the invoice. I was very disappointed to have $32.00 worth of merchandise that I couldn't use or return."
1,Save your money,"This is a really nice little light - it works great the first day! The second day it's a lot dimmer, and by the third day it's completely dark. This has happened with two sets of brand new batteries - I'm not going to let it eat any more. I'm off to find a different light, and you should too: give this one a pass."
2,Not much light and doesn't stick well,This product does not give out very much light and also doesn't stick well to the surface. I kept having to put it back up. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,Have to be a big licorice fan...,"Yes I bought them, but in all fairness, I thought they were like the ones that come in Jelly Belly bridge mix; more like what candy corn is made from. I guess I selectively ignored the 'gummy' right in the title. It's not that there's anything wrong with them, but it takes a real fan of licorice to enjoy 5 lbs of these. I was burned out only half way through the bag and the rest is still sitting in a cupboard over a year later. :)"
2,"Definitely not ""real"" licorice","Haribo candy from Amazon is always good but these are not anything like what I'd call real licorice and have hardly any licorice flavor. This is just soft, black candy.If you want REAL licorice, fresh and with real ingredients, not ""carnuba wax"" and ""beeswax"" and ""modified food starch""...bleh! Get TUBIS licorice.Tubi's Organic Soft Licorice, 3.5-Ounces (Pack of 12)or Panda licoricePanda All Natural Soft Licorice Chews, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12). THAT is what REAL licorice is supposed to taste like.It helps that those 2 licorice brands are the only ones that don't hurt my stomach. Must be that carnuba wax that was killin' me..ew..."
2,"Yeah, whatever... disappointing","Well, I've trying different licorices from various websites, and kept running into this one. Based on the FOUR 5-star reviews already listed here, I was excited to try it. However, if ""into every life a little rain must fall"", then ""bad candy is like a storm.""There isn't much licorice taste to these at all (a friend and I thought they had a hint of chocolate ?) While they aren't sticky, they are kind of mushy and bland. A way better choice for a good licorice experience is ""Gustafs Platinum Select-Sweet"" - THOSE you can't eat just one."
2,Melanie fans beware!,"That Kid Chris seems to have a knack for producing minimalistic trance dance tracks, and truly, ""Come With Me Tonight,"" will take you in; HOWEVER, if you're a Melanie fan and looking for something new and exciting, this is not the cut! The CD jacket indicates vocals by Melanie, but the only ""vocal"" that even remotely resembles Melanie is the chronic, breathy and yes, SPOKEN line of ""come with me tonight."" There is one other female vocal ""line"" that repeats throughout the entire song as well, but this sounds more like an electronic young Aretha Franklin. Who would want vocals from Melanie on their cut without using her truly unique and incredible VOICE to its maximum power? Unfortunately, That Kid Chris."
1,this is NOT the folksinger Melanie Safka on this single.,"We just identified on a Melanie chat list that this is NOT Melanie Safka, so if that's who you are looking for - this single ain't it..."
2,Disappointed with F1 2002,"I gave this game 2 stars. It would have been 1 or zero but for the graphics and sound which are very good (GBA standards) and track maps which are excellent (very close to Autosport quality -speed and gear indications for corners). But, the big downside is the gameplay which is terrible. The tracks are flat and featureless. I'm a lifelong veteran of F1 simulations on every console platform and PC version imaginable and I cannot keep any car in this game(even with max downforce) on the track for very long. The tires wear out at an astounding rate (the second lap in shorter races) and it is like driving on ice. I've actually spun out at under 25 mph in a hairpin! I find it hard to believe this game was actually play-tested by gamers of varying skill levels. It could have been a great portable F1 experience if they put in some reasonable driving capability."
4,Entertaining Action Double Flick,"Entertaining pair of action movies, with The Last Hard Men being the least known of the pair. I am not going to cover the cast, or plot lines, as this review is for the video quality, which is quite good. recommended"
1,No English Audio Track?,"This movie looks amazing. Great CGI animation and backgrounds. I only wish I could watch the movie instead of reading the subtitles. You spend so much time reading, they might as well give you a book instead of a DVD. It's a sad state of affairs when an animated movie with no actors onscreen cannot be dubbed in English for a DVD release. I'm glad I didn't buy this DVD."
1,I was so dissapointed.,"I loved GIST. This movie I have not watched. I will not get to watch this movie unless they fix one small issue. This movie needs an English soundtrack.I do not speak Japanese and I am not willing to read a movie. Books are for reading movies are for watching. Some of my friends are anime ""purists"" (AKA snobs) that only use the subtitles because they say the dub's are normally bad. I don't care its a movie I do not want to read it.I hope someday I'll be able to watch this movie. What little I saw before I turned it off looked fantastic."
1,No show,DVD never arrived. Email to the vendor unanswered. Money lost. Buyer beware. Amazon needs to check the folks the have as vendors.
2,WHAT TH???????????????????????,"After seeing the truly aweful Ghost in the Shell series, I was really jazzed for the new movie. It was a complete disapointment! Boring enough for me to fall asleep. The subtitles, even though I know ther will be a english dub eventually, really took away from a weak story. The anime was good but I'm not a fan of combining CG. ""Couldn't have been a better sequel?"", COME ON!! What a waste, I'm saddened that it ruined the first one, which was/is a classic. Don't waste the rental."
1,Wish I could give this 0 or .5 stars .. horrible job DreamWorks,"Actually, I wish Amazon would allow for two ratings ... one for the movie itself, and one for the DVD. Fantastic movie, horrendous DVD transfer by DreamWorks. As has been stated by everyone here, the way DreamWorks has handled this movie is shameful and beyond disappointing.Do NOT buy this DVD ... it simply is not worth parting with your hard earned cash. Either rent it or find a away to watch the newly released Australian or UK releases (~March 2006) which have DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1 English voice-over tracks."
4,Special Edition English Dub needed NOW!,"1st off I love this film.It took repeat viewings,but after awhile the exposition in the film began to click!However the issue I have is that after nearly 2 years there is no english dub special edition. Please hurry!!!!!"
1,I Wouldn't say NOT to buy ths DVD...,"..However, I was not happy about the fact that it is such a lame release. I LOVE Ghost In Th Shell, the Original, and I could not wait for this film. The artwork IS breathtaking, and it really is an amazing piece of filmwork... but all of the DVD features that it actually does have... suck. There is no English dubbing, which is nice to have when you want to follow the animation, and really enjoy the beauty of some of the screenshots.As with many of the other reviewers, I am not going to recommend you buy this.. but you may like to own this, so that if and when 'they' re-release it.. you can have it as a collectors item. We ARE Americans, and we do collect things, so that may be the only appeal of getting this DREAMWORKS release. Otherwise, save your cash, borrow it from a friend, and wait for the re-release."
1,Very Disappointed with Dreamworks,"Having seen this movie in the theatre I was stunned by the artwork and level of detail involved. The subtitles used in the theatre were the normal subtitles. The story has a few twists and turns and was very enjoyable. Then Dreamworks released the DVD with poor artwork, and closed captioning for subtitles. I have been trying to locate an email address to contact them and express my disappointment with them. I do not recommend the original version. Dreamworks has an excange program now because of the level of disappointment with their product."
1,The subtitles are terrible,"This dvd has terrible subtitles. Everytime there is a sound like footsteps or beeping, the subtitles show it. Whoever did the subtitles must be a complete amateur or a moron. This is probably a good movie but since I don't speek japanese I refused to watch because of the subtitling. I can only blame Dreamworks since the other Ghost in the Shell DVDs not from Dreamworks seem to be quite adequate. I don't understand why they were so cheap as to not include an English dub as well."
3,Audio Warning on US Blu-ray release,"Just a quick warning to those after the ""high Definition"" experience with this blu-ray, while the domestic US release has an English dub, there are no high definition audio tracks on this disc at all. Just plain old Dolby Digital. The Japanese versions (there are 2) have either Uncompressed PCM or Dolby True HD and DTS HD MA. If you are happy with subtitles, these are far superior versions. I have compared both Japanese versions against the US and would recommend the Japanese Absolute Edition over this US one. You can pick the Absolute Edition up from amazon.co.jp or other sellers, however it is quite a bit more expensive than this release. But if you love this film and have the sound system for HD audio, it is well worth it.One other point for international buyers, this version and the 2 Japanese releases are region locked to ""Region A""Score marked down for the poor audio."
1,ghost in the shell game,"Beautiful animation, absolutely incomprehensible story. I felt like I was watching the Matrix after someone had arbitrarily scrambled all the scenes. It has to do with dolls that kill (for reasons I couldn't figure out), which for some reason had a need for human souls, and are finally tracked down by a detective based on clues that don't seem to be explained in any way."
3,Not The Same Without All of Section 9,"I watched this movie & was in awe of the incredible computer graphics, the artwork, that appears during the monumental festival parade.The story line was not new, one of the series episodes featured a similiar them of personal androids killing their masters.It was an interesting movie, but it left a void. Where was the rest of section 9 characters?The first movie, the anime series worked as the cast of characters from section 9 worked together as each character added their expertise towards their objective. It was fascinating to see them in action.Questions about this movie still remain:Why was Togusa's hair black? He has appeared,previously, with dirty blonde hair. His hair color & style set him a part from the others.Why would the ""Major"" lose her android body & disappear into the net?It makes no sense as she was attached to her specific body & wouldn't change to a new body type."
4,Language problem,"Ghost in the Shell 2 pushes anime to the next level. The story is awesome, not to mention the multiple use of combining animation to computer generated images. The only downfall to this is the Japanese language and English subtitles. I did some research about having the English translation version, but they were hurting on the budget so they couldn't translate it. Overall, on a scale from 1 - 10, this one deserves a 9 because of the translation."
1,For God's sake I can hear!!!!,"I have not read all the reviews but I can assume I am saying nothing new. But, I will feel better if i do. I really shouldn't be rating this film because I saw a total of about 12 minutes. I could not get past the Closed Captions!!! What were they thinking. At least give us the choice!"
4,Ghost in the Shell 2 Innocence,"First,Let me say that I am a huge fan of Ghost in the Shell and I have watched and own both of the seasons and enjoyed this movie a lot.The only reason I gave this movie four stars instead of five is that the film was only in Japanese so I had to watch it with subtitles but that didn't take away from the experience of it being a great film.If you hate subtitles this film isn't for you but it's still very awesome."
1,Wait for Bandai Visual's rerelease!,"If you're interested in getting this movie I'd suggest preordering the version coming out next month by Bandai Entertainment/Bandai Visual USA. That release will have newly translated subtitles, the original Japanese dialog in Dolby 5.1, two English 5.1 soundtracks (The R2 UK dub that was produced by Richard Epcar, the English voice of main character Bateau, and a newly commissioned dub adapted from Bandai's new translation), and Director's commentary. There is officially no reason to buy Dreamworks' pitiful release."
1,I got taken...,I was just getting into the whole Ghost in a shell story line starting with Stand Alone complex and working backwards and I was so dissapointed in this DVD. The story and plot are challenging enough in english; trying to read them at high speed was not fun. They should at least put on the cover that the DVD is only in Japanese. I feel like I was tricked into buying this. Thanks for nothing.
1,Dreamworks ruined the viewing experience.,"Being a huge fan of the first GITS film, I decided to rent this film on DVD one day. While the film is brilliant, the region 1 DVD from Dreamworks is horrible. The DVD doesn't feature an english dub, AND the subtitles are awful. They're hearing-impared, which means that when you view certain scenes, it says '[helicopter approching], or '[telephone ringing].' The HoH subtitles are the visual equivalent of watching the movie with someone who won't shut up. ""Oooo, here comes a helicopter!"" ""Did you hear that explosion?"". I will admit though that the DVD does have a great audio/video transfer of the film.Luckily, since I've seen this, Dreamworks corrected the HoH subtitles. This can be told apart by the V4 mark on the DVD case's spine.If you want a dubbed version of GITS2, check out this petition:http://www.petitiononline.com/GITS/petition.html"
3,The best movie you will never watch.,Unless you are fluent in Japaneese you will spend more time reading the dialogue than whatching the stunning visuals of the film. The film has a rich engaging storyline too bad it seems more like reading a book than watching a movie. The publishing of this movie by a major label that is so poor quality is inexcusable. Especially when dubbing is readily available...
1,"OK, But...",I have to agree with the folks who complained about the fact that the ONLY version we got of this feature-length animation film is one in Japanese with subtitles... to Everything. There is too much going on in this movie to have to pay attention to Reading for almost two hours! Grrr. And you have to read Fast! Because the lines go by so fast that I sometimes had to hit the pause button just to make sure I could read what was on the screen before it moved on to the next line. Imagine watching a whole movie via Pause-Play-Pause... A real drag. And not very entertaining like the first GITS movie was.I am Really Upset that I paid money for this that I can't get back because I opened the durned thing.So my advise to those English-speaking consumers out there who are interested in getting this is to wait to see if a version comes out With English voice-overs. Just like the First GITS movie.
1,A Beautiful movie but too many missing features.,"The DVD release I have to say is just awful. There is no english track of any kind given this movie was targeted to American audiences. The second thing the commentaries was in japanese. I'm sorry but the majority of everybody here speak english and even if we sushi, we still speak in American tongues. This movie probably would look better on the book shelf or with your super anime collections and thats probably it. Until Dreamworks re-release Ghost in the Shell 2 with an english then I'll buy it. Otherwise, Pass."
2,"Good Graphics, bad script, WARNING NOTE","Having programed on the visual systems they used for GITS2, they did a great job......being a political science major who enjoys philosophic debates.....not bad.....but unfortunately i am also a sci-fi fan and the plot gets really bogged down about half way into the movie......the biggest problem for me and a real annoying feature that i wish AMAZON would correct is tell us when something is a NON-ENGLISH soundtrack.....unless you understand Japanese you have to have subtitles......this is unfortunate that dreamworks did not create an English version as they did in Ghost in the Shell 1 or its tv version ""stand alone complex""........so i have to down grade it for that because to keep up with the story you have to keep pressing the pause button to read the dialog and then go on.....shame on you dream works and shame on amazon.com for not warning us with a warning label....."
1,One Star is Too Much,"It's not just that there's no english soundtrack, or that the closed captioning is so large that it covers a third of the screen, but this movie is just plain boring. I'm a big fan of Shiro's ""Ghost in the Shell"", but #2 is one of the slowest movies I've seen in years. The majority of the snail paced plot deals with a depressed cop and his dog! What a disappointment. Yes, the animation is great, but it's no better than most of the new Anime movies being produced today. There's much better stuff to spend your money on. I hope I can get my money back."
2,It needs an english voice!,This has no english voice not even english subtitles even if this dvd came with just subtitles I would still be pissed cause you can't enjoy most of the movie by looking down all the time Dreamworks should never do amine ever again.
2,verry lazy,I agree with most of what is being said about this edition of this movie and if I could get in toutch with dreamworks I would tell them to offer this movie with what the fans want and maby it would have better sales here the artwork was amazing but i am not deaf and i do not want to read the movie that is what the manga (graphic novel) is for
1,If I could rate this as less than 1 star I would,"This was the most ridiculous piece of crap ever made. Watching this movie was a complete waste of an hour and a half. The animation was decent but the plot was utter garbage. The story had no point to it, and the philosophical language only made it easier to pass out during the movie. I would rather dip myself in honey and tie myself to a tree in the woods so that the bugs could eat me alive, than ever watch this junk again."
1,Get Ghost in the Shell 1 and skip this one,"GitS 2 is a confused mis-mash of CGI and traditional Japanese animation. The CGI is completely out of place and it distracts the viewer, not letting them into the story. It has the makings for a good story, but the presentation is simply awful."
1,Stupid Subtitles...............,"This is a marvelous film that is ruined by what appears to be a stuck Closed Caption feature. I was going to return it until I read the other reviews. I guess I have to assume that Dreamworks intended you to read ""[helicopter blades rotating]"" or ""[light sounding footsteps]"" including the brackets/brackets closed. Is this defective? Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!"
2,Truly horrible DVD of a truly great movie....,"This has to be the saddest excuse for a DVD I've ever wasted money on. Let me get this straight right off: I LIKE subtitles! it's far better to hear the original voices with their emotional inflections and character intact, even if you need subtitles to get the actual meaning. This disk though contains not a normal English vocal subtitle track, but one designed for the hearing impaired (and not a very good one even at that, does a deaf person really need to be told that an aquarium with obvious air bubbles rising is making a ""Bubbling sound""?) These intrusive popups of notations like ""footsteps"" or ""gunshots"" simply mar the sumptuous visuals, and became so annoying that I couldn't even bring myself to finish the whole movie. Someone at Dreamworks seriously needs to seek more productive employment in the food service industry...."
4,How to get a corrected copy of Ghost In the Shell2!,"Attention! There is now a way to get a corrected version of this movie. As noted the subtitles for this movie are for the hearing impared only, and not a standard translation for the movie. There is now a NO COST TO THE PURCHASER way to get a correct version of this film.1. Go to www.gofishpictures.com. 2. Click on the Ghost In the Shell link. 3. Where it says, for DVD features, news, and trailers. ENTER HERE, click on that link. You will come to a screen with thirteen links on it, click on THE DVD. 4. Where it says Questions about your DVD?

Just fill in the information (adress, e-mail, that kind of stuff), then they will send you the pre-postage paid mailer(says it could be up to two weeks). Put the disc in the envelope and send it back to them, then they will send you a corrected subtitled copy of the movie. By the way I liked the movie!"
1,I want to cry,"This is perhaps one of the greatest animations ever -- and a DVD release with one of the WORST English subtitles in the history of home video. I'm not sure what brainless moron at DreamWorks Home Entertainment put together the release for this DVD, but DreamWorks has done a disservice to the American animation community and Ghost In the Shell's creators.I only hope that DreamWorks will own up to their horrible mistake of mislabeling their DVD box to say it includes Closed Captioning AND English subtitles, because this is false advertising. This DVD ONLY contains the Closed Captioning which makes it impossible to watch for a hearing audience.Purchase this DVD (and any future DreamWorks animations) at your own risk because they are obviously cutting corners in search of making money rather than providing the public with a quality product. Very very disappointing."
3,A fantastic movie with a truly awful DVD,"It pains me to give this DVD 3 stars, because the movie just might be the most amazing anime of all time. However, the DVD is just awful and certainly warrants the reduction in its rating. First off, there is no English dub. This is normally no huge problem for me, since I tend to watch anime in Japanese with English subtitles. However, the subtitles on this DVD, as others have pointed out in their reviews, seem to be closed captioning subtitles. They include stuff like ""[Sound of gunshots]"" which really distracts from the movie. I'm baffled as to why they chose to do this. It's simply ridiculous. That being said, if you're a Ghost in the Shell fan, you need to see this DVD regardless of its crap quality. The movie itself is nothing less than brilliant."
4,The DVD is fixable,"The movie is worth it, and you can get your DVD fixed. Dreamworks will replace it for free with one with good subtitling, if you go to gofishpictures.com/GITS2 there is a form to fill out to replace the less desirable disc."
1,Beautiful Images/ Zero Story/Quotational Hell,"First off, let me just say, I live in Japan and secondly I like animation. Having said that I was horribly disappointed with this dvd.Feeling like I had missed something, I asked a number of Anime loving Japanese ""do you understand this movie""? Guess what answer they gave me! Its not surprising this film didnt do so well in Japan. Yes, Mamoru Oshi has in the past created some master works. Yes, we know he loves his dog (his dog in the movie and ominpresent) and that he desperately wants to let everyone know that by quoting Milton, the Bible and other notable figures in Western Literature in your movie, you can appear to be sophisticated in Western Culture.ENOUGH WITH THE QUOTATIONS!In the end, when no one from ANY culture can understand your story, its time to rewrite the whole thing."
3,Please check out SAC instead,"That being said, GITSI is ok......Again. It is far better than the first film. THe nudity is far less annoying and prominent (simply because Motoko isn't present) and i think it's better that we get to explore the character of Bateu. It's an ok film, but the fact there is no english voices will infuriate some, and the subtitles have captions (if you don't know what captions are you probably don't want to know.)"
3,Wow what were they thinking when they made this?,"I am a huge fan of anything Ghost in the Shell, however I think that it is absurd for this movie to be released in japanese only(despite amazon having it listed as english), there are quality english dubbed versions of this that can be found on the internet of you know where to look. This is a beautiful movie and story, however this dvd version is just terrible, the way it has been packaged and produced and with no english version. Even the artwork on the cover hardly matches the look of the movie.This seriously deserves to be re-released in an english dub and repackaged in a nicer looking form that more accurately reperesents the look and feel of the movie."
1,"No english dub at all , only subs !","In the Amazon discription , it says english audio ... so where the heck is it ? I know the history behind the film , but you'd think by know there wpould be an english version by now.If you hate sub titles , avoid this dvd . Amazon didn't list it right !"
1,"Subtitles messed up, what everyone else is saying","Yeah, I'm sure you've read everyone else saying that the subtitles are close-captioned, but let me just point out: A better studio would admit their mistake. In this case, Dreamworks has failed to issue a recall, and instead tried to pass off this quite glaring mistake as a feature. I can only imagine that they had not a single person testing this product, as even a casual viewing would've revealed this.Incindentally, this might be my all-time favourite movie, but I'm still not keeping this awful DVD."
1,THIS DVD IS DEFECTIVE,"I seriously loved this film and wanted to give it five stars, but alas, it was released without the advertised English subtitles. Dreamworks has admitted they goofed, and hopefully a recall will come soon. If you buy it, beware! The English subtitles are closed-captioned, and if you watch it on a widescreen tv in anamorphic format, the subtitles will be HUGE, obscuring what is one of the most beautifaul animated films ever made. To add insult to injury, it has no English dub, which can be a problem if you simply want to admire the animation. I can't believe Dreamworks released this work of art in such terrible condition. For Shame!"
5,Great movie!,"I'm glad they finally made a translated version of this movie, which they should have done from the start. Graphics are great and the story will have you watching the movie again to actually understand it."
2,Existential and moody - put on your thinking cap,"If you thought the first Ghost in the Shell tackled the deep issues of the human condition and what makes us humans, you were wrong. Though visually stunning, Mamoru substitutes substance with his own rambling beliefs about determinism (greatly influenced by Japanese culture), the essence of the human condition, and identity, ultimately leaving the viewer confused and disappointed. The most confusing scene involves a recursive journey deep into the mind of the only fully human character as he and his partner question a man whose obsession with machinery has led him to transfer his ""ghost"" entirely into the body of a doll to preserve his life indefinitely.The short and sadly lacking action scenese are bloody, brutal, and satisfying, and the animation style of laying hand drawn characters over computer animated backgrounds works well, but does not make up for the movies failures."
4,Ghost in the shell,"This movie is only for die hard fans. It is all spoken in Japanise, but there are English subtitiles. The Graphics are realistic. I love the way they kept the main characters in 2-d and the back ground in 3-d. It makes it like the comic strip witch the movie was baised off of."
1,horrible,"The movie looked awesome, too bad I couldn't understand any of it because it wasn't in ENGLISH!! The DVD case makes it look like a bootleg anyways, there's hardly anything to it. The subtitles are horrible, you can't even understand what's going on half the time, it's like they were written by a third grader or something. Beautiful movie though, wish I could understand Japanese because it looked really impressive."
1,Buy if you understand Japanese,Sadly the subtitles are so bad as to distract heavily from the movie. I really could not enjoy it at all. There is even a petition online for a version with English dubbing or better subtitles.(...)
1,"Subtitles are horrendous, do not buy this movie","Unless you understand Japanese well enough to enjoy this movie do not waste your money. The subtitles assault you with over the top OBVIOUS detail, it's like they mixed up the normal subtitles with the closed captioned ""hearing impaired"" ones. Every background sound/noise is presented to you in text, [dog barking], [helicopter approaching], [sound of gunfire], and it's not something you can disable in the setup menu or your dvd player. How someone could have overlooked this obvious flaw I don't know, however I will be returning my copy and awaiting a release that is done right. While I am a fan of subtitles, you also don't have an English dub option to choose from as well if that's your thing."
1,Movie Amazing/DVD Horrendous,"Do not purchase this DVD. It is absolute trash. The only subtitles they have are closed-captioned for the hearing impaired, so you get captions like ""person walking, someone singing in japanese, etc...."" This is completely inexcuseable, and ruins the film. It is beyond annoying. I recommend staying as far away as possible from this release. Hopefully a proper version will be put out in the future, as such as terrific film definitely warrants one."
2,Good flick but...,"Unless you don't mind your movies in Japanese, wait for the special edition. The only way to get English is through the subtitles. Unfortunate and somewhat mystifying considering both versions of the first film had an English dub.Hopefully this won't damage sales so much that the publishers see this as lack of interest and decide not to release a special edition, or at least a decent one. For other problems & valid complaints, read the other reviews here."
1,English Companys shouldn't Release DVDS from Japan,"Is it too much to ask for a Japaness Company to Release an Anime in the US, Dreamwork Rock but not when it come to Anime. I buy my DVD direct form Japan and it better and easier than waiting for the US company to catch up, LONG LIVE ANIME, oh and Initial D Fourth Stage is coming be ready."
5,it has come,"Everything good that has been said about this newer version release is true, anything is better then the DreamWorks version, so yeah right on"
2,Could have been amazing,"Visually stunning. Great strory. However, this is about as bad of a job as I've ever seen in putting a DVD together. I've seen better fan subs."
3,Screw Dreamsworks,"Wait for the <a href=""http://www.madman.com.au"">MadMan Entertainment</a> release. They had representatives, cameramen, journalists, and most importantly, Mamoru Oshii and Mitsuhisa Ishikawa introducing the film, at the Australia premier screening.As an aside, Madman's release of Akira features the eighties English dub as well as the new dub. They listen to the fans, and are not subject to the same licensing limitations as the US publishing houses."
1,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","I saw this movie in the theater - it was a glorious experience. It was nicely subtitled. It was one of the best jobs done on an anime release for North America. So I was counting the days until the DVD release.I wish I hadn't bought it; it includes NO SUBTITLE TRACK. Thus one may watch it in the original Japanese if one wants, but options for an English version are limited. The only option (excluding proper French subtitles) is for Close Captioned English which makes the movie unwatchable for most viewers. This does not seem to be a literal translation of the Japanese but a summary and includes descriptions of sounds. I quit after a few minutes of it and I won't play it again except for the raw Japanese; obviously I can't show this to friends who don't know that language.Don't waste your money on this."
2,The Movie ain't that great either...,"I feel the fanboy pain on the extras issue, but the movie is a major letdown after the first one. Why? Well, the CGI is so ubiquitous and intrusive, the purity of the cel animation of the first film is totally overshadowed. The mix of ultra-real computer animation and flat cel animation totally takes you out of the story. You get the impression the film makers were so taken with the possiblities of CGI, the plot was totally lost. There are the kind of beautiful and poetic moments you expect from a GITS flick, but the storyline is hard to follow and the surrealist detour the film takes in the second act is pretty and all, but way too showy and distracting. To make sure I wasn't just being cranky, I watched the first one again and my initial opinion was confirmed. And if you're expecting extras, you'll be let down on that count as well. Still, bad GITS is better than a lot of the Anime out there, so you may want to pick it up. Just don't expect too much."
2,"Hmmm... no English, but still a good movie.","Firstly, this DVD has NO ENGLISH VOICE TRACK. That is a major negative. I personally hate subtitles as they distract you from what is going on onscreen. I prefer english voice actors, and would have preferred the same actors from the Stand Alone Complex series (and the original movie) to reprise their role, but obviously no love (and money) were given to this movie to be able to put it out in the best possible format. I would have gladly waited another 6 months to a year to have that version, and I suppose I will be waiting and shelling (pun intended) another 20 bucks out for the next version.The movie itself is good with the most breathtaking animation I've ever seen, it's mix of traditional and CG animation is nearly flawless and beautiful.Buy this DVD if you can tolerate subtitles (and subtitles that let you know ever sound effect as well as words), but if you can't, wait for the money-making better edition that will, sooner or later be made."
5,Listen to your Zep CDs again,"It wasn't until this album that I truly appreciated the bass, keyboard, and arranging skills of JPJ. Having been a die hard Zeppelin fan since I was 8, I was always caught up in Page's sterling guitar playing and the manic howl of Plant's voice.After hearing the thundering, visceral power of Zooma, however, I've gone back to my Zep collection with a new perspective on the band and Jones' role in it. Take any Zeppelin track and turn the bass up, and you'll see what I mean. Jone's fantastic bass playing is even more evident in some of Zeppelin's live material. The improvised jam sessions (on the BBC sessions and on numerous bootlegs) are often ""held together"" by Jones' superb bass playing. Listen to Zooma, and I gaurantee you'll have a new respect for Jones and his work."
5,JPJ Zooms Ahead of Ex-Zep Set,"ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! If anyone ever wondered why JPJ was not included during the Plant and Page reunion, the answer can be found here. JPJ's imagination and sheer talent would have not only embarassed JP & RP, the man himself clearly would've upstaged them both. For example, Bass'n drums, in its simplicity, is a finer composition with those two instruments than most songs you hear with a vocal. The other tracks also show where much of Led Zeppelin's sound REALLY came from. However, you do not need to like Led Zep to enjoy this album. It is uncompromising music from beginning to end--a real treat for a true music fan."
2,Great Bass Riffs Seeking The Rest Of The Song,"I listened to the 30 second samples of these songs and they sounded great. The problem is that what you hear in the sample is what you hear for the entire song. You keep waiting for some guitar or vocals or SOMETHING, and it never comes. To be fair, a few of the songs develop into something that is worth listening to again, but most just repeat the same thing over and over with no development.If you are really into bass guitar, listen to this for ideas and inspiration. If you are a guitar player, use this album as your rhythm section and play along. For the rest, this album does not offer much."
4,Best album by any post Zep member,Way to go John. About time one of you guys(X-Zep members) put something out with some substance.This CD has good intestinal fortitude. It's a keeper. Thanx John.
3,Reminds me of Jeff Beck,"Before John Paul Jones was part of Led Zeppelin, he was with the Jeff Beck group (on Truth and, I believe, Beck Ola). Zooma reminds me more of Beck than Zeppelin. Hard driving, heavy, strong. Since this CD has only a short vocal, I'd recommend it for anyone interested in pure music, but not for someone who needs lyrics with their rock. But, a great album. Also like Beck, I think Jones' music would be strengthened with at least a few vocals. I'm sure his popularity would be widened if he had a few singers. Even Beck hired (and fired) Rod Stewart."
4,JPJ rocks out,"When most progressively minded artists release an instrumental or predominately instrumental album, it usually means an attempt to explore new territory and move away from the rock genre. Not for John Paul Jones, though. Perhaps Mr. Jones released 1999's Zooma, his first solo outing, just to prove that he could rock as hard as he did during his days playing bass in Led Zeppelin. The opening track rockets with a bassline brisk, dense and unyielding enough to butt heads with the most aggressive songs of Red Hot Chili Peppers or Rage Against the Machine. With the exception of the organic session jam session, ""The Smile of Your Shadow,"" the album rarely slows down, discharging more killer riffs, hard-edged grooves and rapid-fire funk than a dozen ordinary hard rock discs. Whatever Mr. Jones set out to prove, he likely proved it. Any hard rock band in their prime would be proud to produce instrumentation this dynamic."
1,Boring self indulgence,Although a long time fan of LED ZEP from the beginning I find this album to be boring and self indulgent. Repetitive and unimaginable are two other words that spring to mind. Do other reviewers wear blinkers when listening to their erstwhile gods?
4,ABSOLUTE POWER!,"Actually, it deserves 4.5 stars - this record is very close to a masterpiece. When I bought this LP I didn't expect this kind of music, to be honest. I thought it had to be soft music, kinda Jon Lord's ""Pictured Within"". And I was so surprised after hearing ""Zooma"" for the first time! It's so POWERFUL and HEAVY! This album is obviously better than anything Plant or Page have done in past 10 years. OK, Robert Plant's ""Manic Nirvana"" and Jimmy Page's ""Coverdale/Page"" album were cool enough too. But ""Zooma"" is something completely different! Let's hope Mr. Jones will continue his solo career as it seems to be successful. I heard him saying that he already has some ideas about his second album. Personally I'd like to hear more keyboards and stuff like ""Snake Eyes"". But I'm sure that anything Mr. Jones will produce will sound great because he knows what he is doing! And for those who still hesitate... well, don't! Go and buy this album now! You won't be disappointed!"
4,For those who want to invigorate their music collection,"Though I knew John Paul Jones had worked with those creating what is tagged ""alternative music,"" I did not expect ""Zooma"" to be as rich and dense an experience as it is. JPL eschews the trappings of Led Zeppelin, something his surviving band mates have not really been able to do, and conjures us a fresh, vital set of compositions.Mr. Jones offers plenty of variety: from the opening blast of the title track---as scary as any King Crimson onslaught---to the Ralph Towner-ish The Smile of Your Shadow, to the loose-limbed Bass' n' Drum. But the more ferocious numbers are the most fun to crank up as your bemused friends try to guess who the hell you have unleashed on them now.I would not recommend this CD to anyone looking for a dose of nostalgia but for those who want to invigorate their music collection, ""Zooma"" will be an asset."
5,Led Head Gets Schooled...,"Zeppelin is my all-time favorite band. Every album, every song, every note...perfection (although ""Darlene"" and ""Ozone Baby"" are a bit thin).The post-projects by Plant & Page have been extremely hit & miss, but THIS...wow.From the first seconds of the first track I was rivoted and kept upping the volume. Like a sonic cannon, JPJ comes into the ring swinging haymakers and shattering the deafening silence of all of these years of being behind the scenes with producing.I admit I was first introduced to this as a DJ at an FM station years back with a promo single, but I was way too into Marilyn Manson, Tool & NIN at the time to hear it with the hungry ears like I have now. Lately only newer Jeff Beck and vintage Miles Davis have been this satisfying to listen to.Crimson/Levin fans take heed - there's an OLD sheriff in town, and his guns are swift & true.Play At ""11"" , anger the neighbors and be baptised by this man's continuing fire."
3,"Not ""In Through The Out Door""",Great studio production. Not artsy fartsy and not a bass soloist venture either. I would have to say it struck me as a combo of Aerosmith and Black Crowes without the vocals. Can't say it sticks in my head calling out to be replayed over and over though.
4,Check out the Catholic Truth Society for a less expensive edition,"An excellent item worth five stars, however this edition from Liturgical Training Publications will cost you more than the exact same volume (different cover only) from the Catholic Truth Society of England (including overseas postage!)Also, you can get from CTS the Meditations and Catechesis on the Psalms and Canticles of Evening Prayer that are not available yet in the United States."
3,Both pleased and disappointed.,"I ordered two of the watches as gifts. One worked. One didn't. The problem was with the watch's movement. Fossil warranty isn't valid, as it was purchased from amazon. Had to ship to an amazon approved repair shop at my expense for repair. Not sure I would order again, due to the added expenses due to cost of shipping and insurance."
4,large brimmed visor,"The visor is very large. It will definitely block the sun, but also restricts your vision. I live in sunny south florida and often don't wear my sunglasses since the visor provides so much protection. The velcro strap allows for easy adjustment to fit. All in all, this is a good product, but just be aware that the visor is very large."
5,gotta have 2!!,"works like a champ, identical to the original base. Needed a second one for the the second car, instead of remebering to swap when taking different cars, or when wife leaves and I forget to get the base, partially stranding me and junior at home."
5,Extra base,"Bought second base for ease of transferring car seat from one vehicle to another. SOOOO glad I did, although easy to install, it is more time consuming than necessary to remove it from the LATCH system and put it in the other car. Love the simplicity of one handed removal of car seat and easy install to extra base."
4,peg perego means Quality,"we chose this peg perego stroller for the quality and we are surprise that really is hight quality, In mexico is very expensive but amazon has great prices and like a Prime Member I didnt pay nothing for the shipment. Great!!!"
4,Works fine.,"For any multi-car family, it's great to have a spare car seat base for the convenience. There's not much to say about features, except that it does the job, `nuff said!The seat is a little pricey, but if you shelled out for the Peg Perego infant seat, you probably knew what you were getting into. Despite the price, I'd definitely buy it again.Made in Italy, good craftsmanship.Over 80% of infant car seats are installed incorrectly. Do your baby and yourself a favor and have your car seat installation inspected by an NHTSA-certified inspector. Find a free inspection location at [...] I used the site to find a local police station with an NHTSA-certified officer that verified the installation for both my family cars."
1,"Mouse did not work, bad software","This mouse is a great size and has a great look. However, when I installed the software for the mouse, I found that the mouse is completely unusable. The scroll bar was going out of control and the sensors on the mouse were all messed up. I purchased it brand new and had this problem. I contacted Microsoft and they were very helpful in getting a replacement. Don't purchase this item, too many problems with the intelipoint software."
1,Middle button is unusable.,"Middle button is a disaster. What a huge POS. Whoever invented tilt click needs to be shot, and the scroll feel is atrocious."
4,It's okay,"Well the product is OK but like with anyone, someone always sees at least one flaw in everything. In this case it is simply that the middle wheel is a bit hard to scroll but I'm assuming that's simply because it's brand new. Maybe it will work itself in later and scroll smoother then. Otherwise, it's as advertised and works well. Nothing extraordinary... just your typical optical mouse is all."
4,Better than Logitech!,"I used to own an earlier version of this & hated when it died. I made the mistake of trying 4 different logitech mice (usb, cordless, & wireless) before ordering this usb Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000. Turns out logitech has a quirk that kept freezing their mice, really BITES in the middle of gaming!I'm so happy I came back to this! It's comfortable to hold, & easy to use! Only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5, is because I tried using it with the included Mouse connector adapter to leave a USB port open, and the scroll wheel does NOT work in that configuration. I swapped it to a USB port and it works perfectly, though a tad stiff. Other reviews seem to indicate the stiffness will reduce with use."
3,"It works, but nothing special.","For the price it is a great mouse. Works well nothing gone wrong with it, again nothing special. Plain and simple mouse."
3,"Lousy mouse wheel ruins an otherwise solid, simple mouse.","The summary pretty much sums up my feelings - I love the Microsoft 3000 comfort mouse, but this one has a mouse wheel that requires way too much effort to move. It feels like the rubber wheel is too big, or like something is rubbing on something else inside. Anyway, it's still a solid mouse, and I've owned others of this same model that have a mouse wheel that feels much better, but be ready to be annoyed if you get a lemon."
2,The right click is horrible...,"So I bought 10 for the office, and I broke 2 of it within a year already because of the right click doesn't response... it clicks but it just doesn't register to the computer.I will stay away from it."
5,Nice,Easy to use and does not make my hand/wrist sore. I have not had the time to use for eveything it says it can do. I would recommend.
1,Unusable - mouse wheel is too heavy,"Like others have mentioned, the middle mouse wheel is very heavy. It requires too much force; it's not usable. Nothing more to say."
1,Scroll wheel zoom,"I hate this mouse. It's super easy to click on the scroll wheel and have it suddenly scroll several pages up or down from where you were and loose your place. Because of this I'm always afraid to press down on the wheel so don't get much use out of it, which is the whole purpose of me owning a scroll mouse. I'm already looking to replace it."
4,middle mouse button is very stiff to click,"Overall, the mouse is quite good. Very responsive, smooth movement, nice comfortable grip in my hand, etc.My only complaint is that the middle-mouse button is very stiff/hard to click (surprisingly, scrolling is very easy/responsive -- it's just the click that is difficult)I'm a light-touch typist/clicker, and I find myself thinking I've clicked the middle mouse button to paste -- but, the text not appearing (as I didn't click hard enough)A minor annoyance, and one that I can (hopefully) resolve by retraining myself to click harder.The left-side button is the perfect size, IMO. Nice & small, so I'm not hitting it when I pick up/move the mouse around. (unlike the models with the large left-side mouse button, which I inadvertently clicked every few minutes!)"
1,Died after a few days,This is a decent mouse - when it worked. But after just a few days it went completely dead.
2,Can't recommend it,"I was excited about using this mouse because of all the additional features like zoom and horizontal scrolling. However, I found the this mouse had a ""traction"" problem in that it doesn't respond to movements very well. Sometimes from an idle position, it takes several movements to get the mouse to react. After several weeks of this, I got frustrated with this mouse and went back to using something else."
2,It's design is flawed and makes it hard to use,"When I first received it, I immediately noticed how big it was. Being a female with fairly average hands, it is not at all comfortable. It tends to slip out of my grasp just enough to be annoying while moving it around, and it's width makes it awkward to hold. I do not recommend it for any user without very large hands.Then there is the click wheel. It has some sort of rubber casing on it, making it hard and sticky to scroll and even tougher to click. The four way scroll is useless, being that most webpages are designed with screen size in mind, and only gets in the way when i want to scroll down.When the computer first starts up, you cannot use it at all for a few seconds, as it is shaky and jumps around for a while before settling down. The tracking seems to be a little...off sometimes. Such as you aim at one thing, it goes to it but a tiny nudge makes you click another link.I do not suggest this mouse, you'd be better off with a cordless option."
2,Hard to click,This mouse was very hard for me to click. Maybe because I have small hands. I had to click near the top and it just didn't work for me. We got a new one to replace it.
2,Anything but comfortable.,"I have used this mouse for just 15 minutes. The moment i used it, i felt great discomfort. My ring finger hurts a little when i use this. Its because of the sharp edge of the mouse (the part where the black and silver parts meet)It takes more effort to roll the scroll wheel of this mouse as compared to other mice. If you do a lot of scrolling, your index finger might start paining. Also, you have to press the scroll wheel very hard for it to click. This might prevent accidental clicking, but its way too hard.There are better mice by logitech, which have a simple and comfortable design. I had a logitech mouse before and i liked it from the moment i began using it. I want to return this mouse. I suggest that you have a look at logitech's mice."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this mouse to replace my old IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0. It works fine, except for on the surface where I actually want to use it. I guess there's not enough contrast on the surface (a mostly white desk) but the old mouse worked fine here.On another surface, it is noticeably more responsive than the old mouse and the 'click' feels good in my hand. The middle click and scroll wheel are a bit different to the old one, but I think I'll get used to them.Overall it is disappointing to need to change the surface for the mouse to work on, when the old optical mouse worked fine."
2,Ouch!,"I have several complaint about this mouse...1. the center wheel is Very hard to click...so it makes opening links in a new tab,(FireFox) Very Annoying...2. it's i little stiff to scroll sideways with the Wheel(witch is why I bought it)it makes my finger shake...3. the center wheel doesn't spin freely,there's some resistances, witch feels awkward...4. the wheel on my old mouse clicked,it provided a tactile feedback, witch I liked...5. the left and the right buttons are way to sensitive,you cant rest your fingers on them at all,(if you do, you've clicked on a link)so you end up holding your fingers up in the air,witch I find painful after a while...good points1. I like the way the Lft&Rit; buttons don't appear separate from the rest of the mouse.2. I like the little Magnifying button on the side3. I did like the new driver,(I didn't think I would)(you do have to install the driver if you want to scroll Lft&Rit;)and being able to remap the buttons."
2,Short lived,"I've owned several microsoft items, including pc mice. This mouse lasted a little over 1 month and just died! I will be returning it, but not sure if I'll exchange or try a different one. I actually like the functions it offers."
1,Wheel Is Terrible,"The center wheel spins funny and since it's rubber coated, it feels much different than a typical mouse where you're able to 'feel' how much you're scrolling. I use AutoCAD a lot and use the center wheel for many things, including clicking it as a button. This mouse is SO DIFFICULT to click straight down. It typically tilts left or right as you click so it takes about 5 or 6 tries to get it to work. I would not recommend this mouse to anyone who clicks on the scroll wheel."
2,Terrible middle wheel,"I can't get used the rotation of the wheel. You can't feel it or hear it for each 'click', so I'm constantly zooming in too far and then back out, etc.What's worse is that the middle button doesn't work at all on mine. If I had noticed earlier, I would have sent it back."
2,Not a fan,"The scroll wheel doesn't click and I can't get it to. I find the clicking wheels I've used in the past to be easier to control. Also every day I have to go into Control Panel and set up the side button to act as a ""back"" button. Otherwise that button is useless."
2,Scroll wheel button is the worst!,If you ever use the scroll wheel as a third button don't buy this mouse! It takes an unreasonable amount of pressure to get the scroll button to work. The Microsoft basic optical mouse part #P58-00001 works so much better then this one. How MS could release this mouse to the public that works as poorly as this one is beyond me.
3,A mouse for office use,"This is your basic MS Optical Mouse. Great Price, and good functionality. The only issues I have had with this mouse are quite strange. If my cell phone rings and is near the mouse, the mouse will ""die"" and I will have to unplug and replug it back in. Strange, but not something that really prevents the mouse from being 3 stars."
2,Painful experience!,"Something about the size and shape of this mouse caused my wrist to become very painful after only using one day and evening. I had to rest my wrist a couple of days afterwards to reduce the pain and inflamation. All of the mouse's features worked extremely well with the latest driver I downloaded from Microsoft's website. Because the features worked so well, I gave it 2 stars instead of none. I actually loved the response of this mouse but am going to have to return it due to the size and shape. However, I am a woman with small to medium hands (size 6 ring if that helps anyone) and use my mouse a lot. Maybe it would work for larger hands or for someone who did not use the mouse much."
2,Not durable,"It was a nice mouse initially, but after 4 months of use, the mouse wheel started binding and skipping. There is no way to open the mouse to get rid of whatever gunk may ba causing this."
2,Aches and Pains,"This mouse is a pain to use:1. As stated by numerous users, the middle click is quite difficult to use because of some strange delay time.2. The left click is simply way too stiff, it's terrible for any kind of gaming. I have to click 3-4 times sometimes to get the click to register, pounding my fingers. Trying to use it with my right hand (I'm left handed) does not help - it's quite impossible. The right click seems fine, however. Odd.3. After using this product for several days I've begun to feel slight aches in my hand joints. I've never had a problem with a mouse before.It's quite a shame, since it seems like an okay product, but simply has too many flaws for it to be useable. I would not recommend it to anyone and if I could, I would return it."
2,not suited for me,This may be a personal preference but I do not like the way the buttons are made. The 2 buttons are of the same plastic piece that is molded in the shape of the mouse; I prefer the mouse with buttons that are of separate pieces. It seems I have to apply more pressure for buttons of the same plastic piece.
1,Terrible mouse,"For the most part, this mouse is adequate, but pressing the mouse-wheel to use as a middle-click is very hit and miss. Sometimes the click registers, sometimes it doesn't. This is really annoying. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap."
2,Visually appealing but sub-par.,"Having owned this product since roughly 2006 I can say that I've used it quite a bit, to the point that the paint has begun to wear off at the corner where your palm rests. I am not a fan of this mouse despite its relatively attractive design, maintenance-free optical sensor and smooth scroll-wheel. Aside from minor complaints about the loud clicking action, completely useless 3rd (side) button and slightly cumbersomely large size, my primary complaint for this mouse is that it has been a total nightmare on my wrist. I'd keep shopping and avoid this substandard product."
5,Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000,"I first purchased this mouse about 3 years ago and never had any problems with it, especially considering that I was not particularly gentle with it. When traveling, I often stick it into a backpack along with heavy textbooks and the last time I did this the magnifying button broke (so I would suggest not doing this), leading me to buy another one. When I first got both mice, I did find that the wheel did not scroll very smoothly at first, but after using it for a while it loosens up. I especially love this mouse for the magnifying button on the side. I also find that it is a very good size - not too big or small. I read another review about not being able to rest fingers on the buttons without them clicking, but I never had that problem with my previous mouse or with the one I just bought. Overall, I find this product to be very inexpensive, durable, user friendly and comfortable."
4,Excellent Mouse,"I do a lot of graphic design and I have been using an IBM optical mouse for a few years for the precision. Bottom line: This mouse is way more precise than others, a huge improvement for my design work. The features are nice too especially the magnifying feature. A warning: your mousing surface must be completely clean an smooth or use a good mouse pad. The precision of the tracking means that any rough or dirty surface will screw up the movement very easily. Feels solid in my hand as well. I also like the programmable features. For instance, I like clicking the scroll wheel in Firefox to open a new tab. The default setting on the mouse for that is to shrink the window. I was easily able to customize that right back just for Firefox without getting rid of the feature for other programs. A good mouse and if you look enough you'll get a good price."
5,Like the name says,"This mouse is very responsive and has a nice shape the fits into my hand. I really like the 'back' button that I use with my thumb, and the wheel is quiet and easy to roll. There aren't any flaws, unless you don't like the slightly larger than average size."
5,"Great mouse, Great Price","I bought this mouse originally as a replacement for a $9.99 mouse, and I'll never turn back. THIS MOUSE IS OUTSTANDING FOR GAMING. It's pretty damned accurate, and it easily fits in my hand. Good price, too."
1,Wheel doesn't work,"I couldn't get the middle wheel to work on this mouse, with or without the accompanying software. I'm taking it back to the store where I bought it and exchanging it for another brand. A computer mouse is too simple and inexpensive to spend a lot of time on. It's not worth any more effort to try to get this one to work. There are a lot of others on the market without having to get further frustrated with this one."
2,Not a good choice,"Although the shape of the mouse is comfortable enough, the scroll wheel requires is not smooth at all. It takes an effort to scroll down. Scrolling up is even difficult. I plan to give up this mouse and buy a Logitech or something else from a nearby store."
4,great mouse for the price,my only complaint is the zoom buttons locations.. sometimes i accidently hit it .. other than that its a nice mouse with some extra features.
4,Nice.....but,The mouse wheel feels numb. There is no sensation if it turning like in other wheel mouses I've used. Other than that weird feel it works great.
3,Unpredictable Mouse,"I bought this mouse for it's extra features and ""comfort"" grip. The horizontal scroll and magnifier button only work sometimes. I find that I must go to the mouse properties and hit ""restore defaults"" regularly and after user accounts have been switched. As for the comfort issue, I bought this because I had surgery on my wrist and I thought the dome of the mouse would be high enough. It is not. I also like a mouse with some weight to it; this one is very light and tends to be hard to control."
1,Center Button is unusable!,"I liked the previous version of the Microsoft mouse but I can not say the same about this one!Uncomfortable to hold with my big hands, it just feels too thin.I do sound editing and the center button is something I use allot, but every time I click it the screen scrolls to the left! Totally unusable for me!The older version of this mouse never did this! I do not know why they cant just put a button next to the scroll wheel instead of making the wheel scroll left right up down and click."
1,do not like it,"Too light. When I let go of the mouse, the cord willusually pull the mouse.Something about the lightness and ergonomics causes the mouseto shift when I click unless I am paying attention.Middle mouse button requires way too much force to click.Everything else about the mouse is great.But the above makes it a pain to use."
2,I don't like it,"I got this mouse a few months ago and I am unhappy with it. Here are all the problems with it compared to the earlier ""Intellimouse Optical"" (the light colored one with the large silver buttons on the left and right).1. The mouse driver crashes frequently and all the button mappings are lost until the computer is rebooted.2. The middle click is hard to use because of the ""squishyness"" of the wheel. I prefer the clicky feeling of the old wheel. I use middle click a lot to open a new tab in Firefox.3. I miss the large ""back"" and ""forward"" buttons on the previous mouse.4. The horizontal scrolling feature is not very useful.5. The default button settings are not useful. I never need zoom."
2,Difficult scroll wheel,"I bought this hoping to replace my favorite mouse for desktop work, the Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 4000, which Microsoft no longer makes. I didn't realize how important my old mouse's left magnifier button was to me until I used a mouse without one. So then I bought this Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 which has the magnifier button and the four-way scrolling that I had become accustomed to. Unfortunately, so much force is required to turn the scroll wheel that it is not useable for normal desktop work. I relegated this mouse, which has a six-foot USB cord, to my server (which only occasionally needs a mouse).This is a good-looking mouse, though very large. If the scroll-wheel worked it would have been a good mouse."
2,Disappointed,This is not a good mouse. Problems:- Wheel scrolling is slow- Wheel click is too hard- Optical movement is terrible on my wooden desk
2,Broke in 2 years.,"An ordinary use for 2 years, right click broke...I have never had a mouse broke this early, I don't thinkI would buy Microsoft mouses no more."
1,Died after very little use,"I had given this a so so review, but it has since died. I paid $10, and it wasn't worth it. MS hardware used to be pretty good quality, but it appears that is no longer true. Spend more, get a better mouse. Even when it worked, it was a marginal mouse."
2,Worth about the price,"I got this mouse because I thought it might be a bit like the old Microsoft Optical 5 button mouse I had for years. However I must say things have changed .. for the worse. The mouse is a bit large and has a stiff cord which makes precise movements difficult if the cord is set up against something such as a laptop or keyboard. Additionally the middle mouse wheel/button is dreadful. The scroll has no ""click"" to it and feels as if there is some manner of grease preventing the wheel from spinning freely (which temporarily lessens after several seconds of repeated scrolling as whatever the substance is heats up and looses viscosity). The middle-click functionality of the scroll-wheel is equally horrendous as it takes a considerable amount of force applied at a somewhat unnatural angle to achieve a click.Do not purchase this for anything but a backup mouse for rarely used hardware. For any machine you'll use regularly it's worth buying a nicer mouse."
2,Does not work on even marginally reflective surfaces,"I've got a white IKEA table with a slightly reflective surface. I know this can be a problem for some optical mice, though the past two that I have owned worked on it with no difficulty. The MS Comfort Optical 3000 doesn't register any movement upon it at all. It's a shame, because it does feel more comfortable in my hand than my previous mouse.The scroll wheel in the center is a bit off-putting as well, as it moves so smoothly that my finger doesn't register it as well. I used this mouse with a mousepad for a couple days before remembering that this was not 1995."
3,Okay,"Considering the price, this is a fine mouse. But it is very large. I bought it for my kids after one review said it was too small. I have big hands, this mouse is as big as my hand. But a decent buy."
2,"Good resolution, poor scroll wheel","This mouse has good resolution and works well on a variety of surfaces.What I don't like is the scroll wheel. There is no ""racheting"" action (no little ""notches"" as you rotate the wheel). Combine this with excessive force required to click the scroll button, and it's very difficult to achieve a scroll click without also scrolling at the same time. I also think the little side button is too small, but that's a minor annoyance."
4,"Great Product! Not for Firefox users, though.","This was my first optical mouse and it worked rather impressively. Operation is quite effortless (almost too effortless) and the ergonomic design exceeded my expectations.It, however, didn't cooperate with Mozilla Firefox very well, as my old mouse did. I had to recalbirate the mouse buttons to activate middle click and the autoscroll button. Middle clicking requires an awkward and deliberate motion as you have to click the front-most part of the wheel. That's quite frustrating and somewhat painful, but could be gotten used to.The acoustics of this mouse are quite different from what I'm used to. It makes a rather hollow sound, rather than a high-pitched ""click"", whenever I press a button."
2,great mouse until the phone rings,"As an electrical engineer I cringe when someone says electromagnetic interference because its usually an excuse for something else. Well not in this case. if a cell phone or Blacberry is nearby or if one rings the mouse constantly disconnects itself. Sometimes it re-connects sometimes you have to just reboot the machine.The mouse functions fine otherwise the scroll wheel is a little heavy and hard to click but that is not a feature I look for. The magnify button was the reason I bought it and its very useful if you are right handed which I am. Right now I am using it left handed due to some recent hand surgery and its unusable left handed.I have moved my mobile devices to the other side of the desk but if the problem keeps up I will probably get a new mouse. Good luck getting help from MS, thier products website really needs a user forum but I'm guessing they are afraid of too much negative feedback."
2,Nearby cell phone breaks this mouse,"If you place your cell phone near this mouse (no need to place a call, or receive one), the mouse will freeze up and stop working. I have seen other reviews (here, and at CNET) that say the same thing, so it is a real problem. This is unacceptable in today's world, and despite the smooth feel and low price, I have to recommend that you do not purchase this mouse. I am going to pursue a refund, and get a different mouse."
1,Worst mouse ever,"This is the worst mouse I've ever used. The wheel does not rotate easily, you have to push down on it before you get enough friction for it to move, and of course, pushing down on it causes unwanted responses on the screen, plus the ridges on the wheel are so minor they don't engage your finger which tends to slide over it instead. And the horizontal scrolling (by pushing sideways on the wheel) is awful, awful, awful ...it's not smooth, it jerks a sideways jump at a time, if it moves at all (it also needs way too much force to engage). Plus the shape is not any more ergonomic than mice of decades ago ...your little finger will hurt after a while, and there's no appropriate place for it to rest. And if you have a man's hand this mouse is too small. This mouse is not worth two cents. That's my two cents."
4,It's all about the cord,"My past three mouse purchases had all been wireless, yeah it sound nice, look modern BUT, you keep having to buy batteries. I'm tired of buying AA batteries and of course it always dies at an inconvenient time. So I opted for the corded mouse, optical, Microsoft. Seems well built, fit a medium to large hand easily. I like the first one so much, I bought two more. Great price, bye bye batteries."
1,Possibly comfortable...for a gorilla,"After 2 days of using this mouse every finger on my hand hurts. The problem starts with the shape which is an hourglass and forces the thumb out. The mouse is also wide and forces an unusual angle of the fingers to click buttons. The mouse has an unnatural curve that requires resting the palm on the back. The left and right buttons are stiff and I would say require twice as much force to depress as my previous cheap mouse. The buttons are formed from 1 piece of plastic that acts as a spring. Additionally, the right button does not set flush with the mouse body and produces an annoying ridge. The middle button requires probably 5X the force of my previous mouse and has an unusually long travel. Anyone that clicks the middle button often will soon fatigue. The zoom function is a gimmick. I didn't use the horizontal scrolling. If the mouse has any positive characteristic it is that the scroll wheel has a positive feel."
1,Picky about surface; doesn't track movement,"I don't know why I put up with this mouse. My previous optical mouse worked wonderfully, but since it was wireless and I constantly forgot to turn it off, it would run out of power on a regular basis. Enter Microsoft comfort optical mouse 3000. I was quite happy with the fact that I don't have to worry about the power issue anymore. Little did I know, it was terrible at tracking the mouse movement. I have a black textured desk, and I can see the heterogeneity of the surface with my naked eye! I don't understand why this mouse has so much trouble with it. I tried using a mouse pad with it too, and movement tracking improved, though still worse than I would expect. The distance I moved the mouse around is never consistently proportional to the movement I see on the screen. Terrible! I would never recommend this product to anyone."
3,Microsoft Mouse review,"This is not a comfort mouse for me. All the other features are just fine but because of a hand tremor it is difficult for me to control the right mouse button. This problem makes playing games on the computer almost futile. I've never had that problem with a larger mouse. Also, I have arthritis and the cramped position my hand is forced into causes me pain. I would not have purchased this particular mouse had I known how small it is. My suggestion would be to indicate the size of the mouse by a label of small, medium or large on written descriptions and on the package, or either make the product larger or make another one of a larger size."
2,Mouse wheel is terrible,"The scroll wheel doesn't have a ""clicking"" action -- it is continuous and actually a little difficult to move. The button action on the scroll wheel is difficult to trigger. There is only one side button. I was hoping for two side buttons."
2,"frustrating, NOT ergonomic, NOT comfortable.","Earlier this year I wrote that the mouse's function gradually got better over the course of several months. I gave it 4 stars at the time.The mouse wheel decided today that it will stop cooperating with MS Word again. The zoom function (ctrl-mouse wheel) is not working.The click buttons are finicky too. Occasionally, when I want to select an area, I have to really press down hard on it or otherwise it selects what it wants. This probably happens a few times a day.In my view, this mouse is NOT ergonomic. The dorsal side of my right hand had started hurting so much that I switched to my left hand a few weeks ago. Now my left hand has started to hurt in a corresponding location. I've never had a problem like this with mice before.In other words, I've had so many problems with this mouse that I'm shopping for a new one right now. This mouse is ideal for giving as a gift to people you don't like.Okay, I'm off to do more consumption."
1,Wheel has no traction,"I am long-time fan of the old IntelliMouse Explorer and had hoped this would be a fair replacement for the money. I was wrong. I learned to despise the Comfort Optical 3000 almost immediately. This wheel is slow to respond, spongy and hard to press. The right and left buttons are equally dull and the side button is just a bit awkward. I am returning this mouse and looking again."
5,great item,this mouse is easy to use. it is very comfortable in the hand and works great. i received it very quickly. i would highly recommend this item.
2,Nice mouse except for scroll wheel,"I have used a few Microsoft wired mice, Logitech M310 and a Dell mouse that came with my Dell Studio XPS...all are better than this mouse when it comes to the scroll wheel. The wheel is stiff and doesn't click to a incremental scroll. I do not recommend b/c of that feature. If you aren't a ""scroller"" then this mouse is a good fit. it is accurate and ergonomic."
3,Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000,Needed a back up mouse for the PC and lap top. The price was good and I know Microsoft makes good equipment. No issues with the mouse to date.
1,Middle click button doesnt work. Beware.,"I have been trying to program the middle button to work as ""open in new tab"" in Firefox, which is the default setting. It should do this out of the box, but it doesn't. The mouse would occasionally open the link, but 99% of the time it wouldn't. I looked up the mouse on Google and other people people are having this problem - it is really annoying to have a mouse with no middle click. It turns out to be a hardware design flaw. I can click the very bottom of the click-wheel - a spot where no one would naturally click the button - and the tab opens as it should. The same goes for the very back of the click-wheel - click there and the tab opens.Pressing the click-wheel in a natural or comfortable position will not work at all. Which is unfortunate, as the mouse is called the COMFORT mouse.I have never had bad luck with an MS mouse until now, but come on, how hard is it to get something as simple as a mouse consistently right?"
2,Bad wheel,"Wheel of the mouse doesn't work well, even after I installed the software. It cannot zoom in and zoom out pictures, which could be done by the wheel on any other mouse."
2,Not a good mouse,Pros: The mouse part works as well as the 2 top buttons and the side button.Con: Mouse wheel it hard to push down. There is not tactile click of the wheel to indicate amount of movement.Con pt2: The scroll wheel button become so hard to push that I had to resign the Middle Click to the side.Final Verdict: Avoid!
1,Nearby Cell phone causes problems,"If a cell phone is nearby or you are talking on it this mouse keeps getting disconnected. Reinserting it into the USB slot does not work. However, if you take the cell phone away it starts working properly. This is unacceptable in this day and age. I am going to buy a new mouse and probably not from Microsoft ever again."
2,A disappointing product,"I bought this mouse to replace a previous MS optical mouse. I must say that this model is not as good. As others have stated, the middle click on the mouse wheel requires far too much force. I do not see why the middle click would require more force than the left or right click. That design decision does not make any sense.The 4th button is useless to me as I am lefthanded. I knew the location of this button before I purchased the mouse but MS should really remove the wording from the package that says it is comfortable for either left or right hands.The left click does not provide a consistent feeling either. It feels as though something is misaligned.I will continue to look for a replacement mouse."
2,It doen't work,I always use Cad system for my job. I'm design engineer. This mouse didn't work center roller button especialy using Cad system. Tha's wahy I give negative feedback!
1,"Does not work on ordinary surfaces, does not middle click","I've always had really good luck with Amazon crowdsourcing. Whatever I needed, I could just grab the most popular item on Amazon and be happy with my purchase. I've found really great bargains that way.Until now. The laser on this thing becomes confused on an ordinary desk surface and will not track. I've had to slide an envelope under it just to get this review typed.And in this age of modern browsers, I need a designated middle click to close tabs in Firefox and Chrome. I'm using Intellipoint 8.2 and that option simply does not exist.Glad I didn't pay much for this because it's going straight in the trash."
4,Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 Review,The mouse works great and the shipping was punctual. It was a pretty good value for a mouse and it isn't too cheaply built. The only problem I had with it was the scroll wheel was a little uncomfortable to use. I can't perfectly describe it but it just feels strange and it has a lot of resistance when you try to move it. Still for the price I think it's a pretty good buy. Horizontal scrolling is also a nifty added feature for web browsing.
3,OK mouse,"Sure I understand that you get what you pay for. This mouse is what I expected, its bulky but it gets the job done. The mouse wheel is also not as comfortable to use as those on a higher end mouse. Its difficult to turn and contributes to the theme of ""bulkiness"" that goes with the rest of the mouse. All in all, it gets the job done."
2,Doesn't work as advertised,"While the mouse works fine as a 2 or 3 button mouse, and is a good bargain if that's all you want, those who may be buying it specifically for the benefit of having a 4-button mouse (as I did) will be disappointed. The work I do requires a lot of cutting and pasting, and having a mouse button assigned to cutting and another to pasting makes the work many times faster. While this advertises a 4th button on the wheel, as other reviewers have noted, it is AWFUL. Having spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure it out, it seems like it will only do what you've programmed it to do when you press the wheel while making absolutely no other motions with the wheel (like left/right or up/down). It basically makes the 4th button unusable. If you want an inexpensive 3 button mouse, this is a good option. If you are looking for 4 button functionality, look elsewhere."
3,"Not as good,","This Mouse is not at all as advertise the wheel does not work right it takes several turns for it to move the page up or down the size of the Mouse is about right but could do with the back part a little higher.if you won't a cheap mouse this is it,"
4,"Pretty good, but certain things...","Had this for over a year now and I still like to use it, so that's saying something. Condition has not deteriorated at all.Proslong and comfortable, fits my medium sized handscool side button for extra functionssilent scrollingwired (no battery change required)Consheavier mouse (I like it, but not everyone does)terrible middle click button (tried to use it for CAD like programs, failed miserably)Not wirelessnot compactOverall, I really do like this mouse: it's dependable, usable, and comfortable."
1,Left Click Problem,"Do not buy.....Left mouse button seems to have a 1 second delay in every mouse click.If you reassign the button, the delay is still there for the re-assigned key.Looking on the web a number of people seem to have had the same problem.Driver upgrades/downgrades do not fix - this is a hardware fault.Bought this from another vendor who would not take it back.In future I will stick to Amazon :)"
1,Horrible middle scroll wheel,"I am disappointed about the middle scroll wheel. It will scroll, but not unless you press down harder to scroll which is unusual and feels uncomfortable. The scroll wheel has this smooth plastic that provides no friction against your fingers.You also cannot use the middle scroll wheel as a button.I threw it away immediately after I used it for 5 minutes.Bad design. Please avoid this product.BTW, how did this mouse design pass Microsoft's Quality Assurance dept?"
1,"Not a good mouse for gamers, not a great mouse period","I purchased this mouse at a local superstore for $20. My hand outruns the pointer regardless of speed. During gaming it is hard to get the middle button to activate due to it's latency and the fact that the side scroll tilts with far less pressure than it takes to press down the wheel. Even with accelerated scrolling turned off the wheel either over or under shoots it's mark consistently. During document browsing, as you hold down the side scroll the middle mouse will eventually give in and start the hand free scroll. All in all this mouse is worthless and I would not recommend anyone to purchase it unless I was seriously mad at them."
1,Microsoft destroys another formerly good product,"I just installed the Comfort 3000 mouse and immediately began seeing horizontal flashes across my screen. Updating my ATI Radeon Pro drivers didn't help, but disabling iPoint.exe did. According to reports, version 6 of the mouse software conflicts with ATI and several other video cards, producing constant flashes and horizontal flickering.My eyes can't stand it, so I'm going out to look for another mouse tomorrow. After spending 2 years dealing with Intellimouse Explorers that generated spontaneous doubleclicks, the next mouse will not come from Microsoft."
1,I second the cell phone problem,The mouse cuts out around cell phones. It's a nice mouse but because of this problem it is easily the most annoying mouse I've ever used.
3,Clumsy to use.,"This mouse was not comfortable to use either for me or my husband. It is not a fast mover or pick up objects such as puzzle pieces. If you only need a mouse for office work it would be ok, but NOT for any games."
3,Microsoft Optical Mouse,"Pros: Handles nicely, good size, feels smooth.Cons: the sound of the clicks is like a bomb going off, hard to click in the middle button.Overall its a decent mouse."
3,Not Durable,"This is the second unit of this exact same mouse model because the first one gave up the ghost after 3 years of use. I like the features but think a mouse should last longer. Admittedly, I gave the first one heavy use and it is and was cheap."
2,Functional and comfortable but horrible scrolling capability,"Its an inexpensive mouse, and you can tell when using it. I've never had problems while using it without a mouse pad, and it is comfortable to hold for extended periods. My main problem is the scroll wheel is completely worthless. I use applications that need fast scroll wheel movement, and this cannot deliver. It feels like there's something in the mechanism that is needlessly making it difficult to move the wheel, and the distance the applications scroll is very small. I went to the settings to turn the scroll speed up in a vain attempt to help it out, and it didn't work. So now in order to scroll down a web page I need to make 2 to 3 times as much movements as other mice I've used. Maybe I have a defective model, but its annoying. Also the side scroll function with the tilting scroll wheel, has never worked well enough to be useful. If you're looking for good scrolling options avoid this mouse."
1,Scroll wheel doesnt work (also has no detent clicks),"After looking for a good corded mouse I thought this would be good, being a Microsoft product, but it is nice in concept, very poor in design and manufacturing. The scroll wheel worked for about 30 seconds, while feeling terrible (during the 30 seconds)and then it just stopped. The scroll wheel has no detents and is extremely still and hard to move without clicking. I bought 2 of these and the scroll was equally bad on both! One at least worked for more than 30 seconds, so I am having to return one. Try a different mouse."
3,Not that comfortable...,"PROS: Affordable and well built. It comes with good software for assigning different functions to buttons (for all system or for specific programs).CONS:* SIZE: Not as comfortable as you may think. This is the biggest mouse I have ever had, roughly 12x7x4 cm which looks excessive on any desktop and against contemporary things sizes. Its size and weight is a remembrance of early computer development stages.* FUNCTIONALITY: The wheel scrolls softly up and down, but works terrible as center button. You almost lose the possibility of opening new tabs in a browser as you have to hammer the middle button just for getting an inconsistent response. I solved it assigning middle click to thumb button with Microsoft Intellipoint software, but unfortunately loose other interesting possibilities with thumb button. Despite its form, this mouse is not really symmetrical for left handed people, as it has only one thumb button on left side."
1,Most annoying mouse I've ever used.,"innacurate, needs mouse pad or rough multi-color surface to work. Good luck trying to use the middle mouse button. I do not recommend this mouse to anyone. Buying it was a mistake."
2,It's a mouse. What more do you want?,"I've had the mouse for about two weeks, and it's typical for mice. Points nice, doesn't try to invade small eastern European countries, and so on. Tonight, however, I'm dismayed to learn that the left button is sticking when I click. It was operating fine when I left it this morning, so either someone is purposely breaking into my locked building for the sole purpose of squirting some sort of adhesive into my mouse-- or it's failing. After TWO WEEKS."
3,Rather limited listing,"Not an expert in the field, but I simply had trouble finding simple, common words in this dictionary."
3,"""Practical"" is right","This is a very simple, basic dictionary. Does not separate meanings. Small vocabulary. Works well in restaurant environment for making small talk in both languages :) For serious study, use something bigger."
2,This book needs some work!,"The book covers essentials and a diligent student 'could' learn a lot from it. BUT there are far too many errors in even the latest edition. Furthermore, the author appears to have a rather low opinion of Germans and the German culture; she constantly utilizes quotes and proverbs that paint the German mindset as unwaveringly depressed and negative. Also, who ever heard of Fritz Martini? Citations from his writing appear in most chapters but his writing is obtuse and needlessly difficult. It's not as though every German knows him and his work. I suspect the author studied with him at some point and is attempting to keep his name alive... a name that would otherwise be quickly forgotten!There must be a better book that does the same thing as this one more effectively."
3,"fine, no better than other books","This book is acceptable, but it represents no advance on other textbooks for reading German."
3,Too Many Errors!,"I've only been through the first four chapters so far, and while the general content of the book is great, the book is just riddled with errors. It ships with an errata sheet, but even this doesn't cover all of the problems in the book.This is a very poorly proofread text and might present some real difficulties to new students of German who want to study on their own. As well, not all answers are provided in the back, only a ""selection."" This seems to be a needless oversight for students who want to use this on their own."
5,One of the best I've read,"I have looked at many books in my quest to learn how to read German. Most don't serve that purpose well. Wilson's book stands above the rest. It is clearly written, and has a way of getting me up to a moderate speed quickly. Her long experience in teaching German clearly shows through."
3,TRYING TO FIND HERSELF,"Juliet is wondering who she is and ends up in San Francisco's tenderloin district. First she is astripper at a ""no touch' sex clubwhere she dances and strips. Shecan sit with the customers and talk but no sex allowed. Thenshe breaks the rules and becomesa prostitute for a lot more easymoney as she calls it. She andMary become friends and they end up in a commune, unaware of itsreal purpose. Mary's parents kidnap her to take her home butJuliet has no one to save her until a friend of her father shows up.She returns to her original hometown wondering what to do next.This is Denham's fist novel and she doesn't do much to encourageJuliet to develop depth of character or learn much from herexperiences. It reads more like ascript to develop and explore butmaybe Denham herself will grow from this first attempt and come out fighting in her next book."
1,NOT INSPIRING,"This story is flat, unfeeling and a no-brainer. The editorial reviews find depth and purpose but sadly, I do not. A young girl ends up in the tenderloin district of San Fransisco as a stripper, prostitute, drug addict and hepatitis carrier. Told in the first-person, Julliet is almost a non-person. I could not relate to her at all. Summed up: ""I went, I saw, I became, I returned."" Shades of high school Latin which was more interesting! Read it if you must but borrow it. You may find it interesting but a trip to the grocery store has better taste! This is a first novel but I hope she improves 100% before offering us a second one."
4,Good price. Quality product.,"I bought this starter pack from my DYMO labeler. I have used each of the tapes provided at least once, and they worked pretty well when placed on flat surfaces (i.e. folders, drawers).However, I need to check to see if there are tapes with better adhesive because these do not work well when labeling wires (i.e. coax cable). Even when I wrapped the label around so the ends would overlap, the label kept coming unwrapped. I finally resorted to putting tape over the label to keep it on, but it was frustrating nonetheless.For basic office/home-office uses, this label tape performs well. For other uses, the results are inconclusive."
5,Great way to get what you need,"I'm a label nut. I hate digging through cupboards looking for something and resorted to using Dymo labels on the inside of the doors to stay organized. I got frustrated trying to find the various styles, types and colors of Dymo tapes in local stores. Store A would have the plastic, but not metallics, Store B would have the metallics and paper, but not plastic, Store C would be out of one or more of the colors I needed. Rather than trying to keep in mind which store was likely to have what I needed or calling the store to check, I ordered this package from Amazon.It shipped quickly, contained three of my most commonly used tapes: white paper, white plastic and clear. This is so much easier, cheaper and less frustrating than running around town and spending gas money. I've ordered several more tapes through Amazon and now have plenty whenever I need them."
1,Read the product description very carefully,"I had ordered this product with the intention of receiving 3 paper labels. When I received the order it consisted of 1 Paper, 1 Plastic and 1 Clear tape this is described in the fine print!"
3,The tape glue is not strong enough and the tape comes off easily,"The vendor was fine--prompt shipping etc. But the tape is not as sticky as needed to be. It was good on glass surface, but comes off easily on many other less polished surface."
3,"Two papers, no clear","Love the label maker but I bought this tape kit and it came with two papers and one white. It should have had one paper, one white tape and one clear tape. Disappointed in this since I love the label maker so much."
1,Links too big,"My wife and I have owned fossil watches for several years. This is the first time I bought one without trying it on first at the store. We have never had any issues with fossil, and I will continue to buy their watches, but I was very displeased with this one.The links on this watch are too big. I had to remove a few in order for it to fit me at all. Right now, the watch is too tight, and it leave marks on my arm, so I can't really wear it. If I add ""1"" link it is too big and slides down my wrist. So bad to the point if I bend my wrist up, the knob jams into my hand. This can be very painful if you set your hand down fast or rest your hand on something (I know from experience).Fossil makes great watches, and I normally love them.2 thumbs down on this one."
3,Smells good,"The product smells good, but I have been using for a month and I don't think my hair is any softer or manageable."
3,du bois is the one,perhaps prof Foner's complete work might get me to think differently but Du Bois' work written in 1935 is an astonishing masterpiece--not simply for its detailed history of the period but because of its analysis which sheds good light why we were as we were in 1935 and as we are now. I read this shortened version which might be good as an introduction I suppose but lacks the intricacies of Du Bois' analysis--perhaps I 'll read the big one (I suspect Prof Foner might agree with me)
4,Almost as good as the longer version,This book covers reconstruction in very thorough way. It gives some insight into current issue such as reparations. A good intro history.
1,This Book Makes Me Want to Kill Myself,"This is so boring I don't know how I read through it. This is the reason why people don't like history. It is really boring, and it's extraordinarily complicated, when it could have been simpler."
1,avoid this rubbish,"I used to watch the old Bowery Boys movies in the theatre so I was pleased to see them available on dvd - what a let down. These films look like they were taken from really rubbish quality old video tapes complete with scratches, blips & jumps - I don't expect movies of this vintage to be perfect but in view of the 3 Stooges box sets that I have bought from you which are brilliant this lapse in quality is a disgrace to Amazon & collectors should avoid being ripped off - hope this helps. I returned my copy for a refund on Feb 8th - it's now Feb 22nd & still waiting. Never again."
3,Not too bad,"I bought these in January 2010 and had them for about 3 years now. After I bought them I only skated about a month with them and then put them away till next winter. Skating season where I live is about 3 months. So all in all, i only skated with them about 6 months or so and from all the tightening of the laces, one of the holes that the laces go into broke on me so its hard to tie them now. It seems as if theyre not put together all that good and I paid a lot for them at the time (full price about 60 dollars). They also get rusted and it seems the blade which is nailed in to the bottom of the base starts to come off as you use them more and more. I did see a few people with these same skates. All in all, they could be cheaper, I would recommend going to a sporting store and getting ones from there (much cheaper and convenient). Atleast these were better than rental skate from a rink..."
4,Great relaxing music,This is one of the easier listening music CD's around. Sit back relax and enjoy. Particularly liked Luis Villegas tracks for relaxing steady beat of guitar. Can be played at any time for pleasant background music.
1,So-So,"The true veteran from all these artist's is none other than Kitaro, The other artist's are generic versions of the true Flamencos, Jazz players, etc.....I found the C.D. to be more boring than interesting."
3,"All the right notes, but little passion","Jon Nakamatsu plays Rachmaninov's Third Piano Concerto with grace, yet with little passion, a commodity that should be inherent in any rendition of this work. There are precedents for this sort of interpretation (Rachmaninov himself), yet this recording just seems bland, despite the competency of Nakamatsu.The orchestra also seem to be on auto-pilot, and the SACD multi-channel offers little enhancement. If this is the sort of performance of this work that you prefer, then you would be better off seeking out the Byron Janis versionRachmaninoff: Piano Concertos Nos. 2 & 3 [Hybrid SACD]. If you are after a more exciting rendition in SACD format, Arcadi Volodos' version is a treat, although like the Janis, it is in Stereo SACD only.As this is an expensive disc, I would recommend you listen to the sound bites before purchasing."
2,Central Park Concert,"While I do enjoy a good concert by Garth, I found it sad that the ""Central Park"" concert was cut by a good deal, the video was about 2 hours long, this was maybe 90 minutes on DVD. Very sad."
1,Save your money.,What a total let down. Whoever was responsible for post production editing is hopefully no longer working. The video footage is great. The audio is awful.You have to crank the volume to make out the music/lyrics over the crowd noise.Of the complete set the last disk was the only one with decent audio quality due to the fact that the videos were produced in a studio. As a Garth Brooks fan I was very disappointed with the quality of this product.
5,great value,"This set was a very good value for the money, very entertaining. Great gift for the country music lover evreyone loves Garth Brooks!"
5,wonderful music,It was neat to watch Garth change and mature during the span of his career. We got to see him in concert during the Nashville flood recovery show. WONDERFUL!
3,Garth Brooks Live,"All aspects of this video compilation are outstanding except for one important quality; GARTH'S VOCALS AUDIO!The music videos are fine; however, the vocal audio for live footage is very low. It is hard to hear Garth on several songs, but some improvement is noticed as the concerts progress. It's so sad that such an excellent prodction was ruined because of a few errant audio settings. It's hard to fathom such a debacle in this day and age of production quality control.If you love Garth, you'll still enjoy this set regardless of the audio issues...still very entertaining. A long long time will pass before we see another entertainer who will appeal to such a broad fan base and cause such a frenzy at Garth has accomplished."
4,Definately Garth,This is a must have for any true garth fan. Especially the concert in central park. :)
4,Must See Zombie/Stoner Comedy,"Bong of the Dead is a stoner comedy on the order of Cheech and Chong, but with Zombies. The special effects and gore scenes are amazing for the budget, and the characters are likeable (but often annoying). The middle drags a little and there are far too many scenes of our heroes kicking back and partying. That being said there were a few things I haven't seen in a movie before (especially a zombie movie) so the uniqueness of the story and situations make it a must see for Zombie fans. Give it a watch and you won't be disappointed. Just be aware that the movie is 70% stoner comedy and 30% zombie ....but the 30% makes it worth your time."
2,Little Phrases,"The book is divided into several chapters, parts of Gabrielle's life. None of the stories are perticularly spectacular, but the little phrases, sometimes captured in the English translation, can be profound. I found it easier to read if I bookmarked these phrases."
1,Les rue Deschambault,"horrible book. Had to read it for french class. It is one of the worlds most boring book, second only to As for me and My House. I only came her to see if there was any info on the book, becasue i have to write a composition on it. I definitely reccomend that you Not read this book. It would be a total waste of time. trust me. You will be sorry for wasting your precious time."
2,missing 2 songs!,"I was very disapointed in this cd. As all the other reviews stated the LIVE AT THE COPA portion is missing the last song (i know i'm losing you) but also, WITH A LOT OF SOUL is missing one of their best songs ever YOU'RE MY EVERYTHING. Can anyone tell me if this song was not released on the uk version? Also does anyone notice all the noise during the COPA portion (clicks ETC... And last A WARNING! about THE 2 fer SONG FOR YOU/MASTERPIECE CD. I just read that the masterpieces song are edited. If they are not going to release these cds right, than why release them at all!"
3,Missing a song,"Great stuff, but Copa is missing the last song. I wasn't aware of it until I saw the reproduced back cover of the original album. They should let a person know on the cover if songs are missing."
1,No luck with 2.4 GHz phone and WiFI,"I had no luck getting this item to work, too much interference from my 2.4 GHz phone and my WiFi network made the picture and audio full of static. On one channel (""B"")\ it caused my wifi not to work)."
4,Dirk doesn't fit the environment!,"Yes, this game is fun and easy. The graphics are great, but Dirk the Daring looks annoyingly 2D, in the game and on the box. It's like putting some old cartoon in the real world. If you can ignore this fact, you will enjoy the game."
4,baño de damas( ladies room),"baño de damas or(ladies room) presents the narratives of some women(and of others that are not, but would like to be) shared in a discotheque restroom.based on the play by the famed writer rodolfo santana.with stellar performance and daring scenes by renowned hispanic artists eduardo santamarina,viviana gibelli and lorena meritano. this movie shows us the complexities of the latin female persona in an utterly sensual.amusing and dramatic way... all culminating in the film's unexpected ending."
5,"Excellent , Could never be duplicated-a lost art",Its refreshing to listen to the feelings and sound of someone that tells it like it is with such commitment.
4,The devil among us,"This was one of my favorite episodes from the series and my second favorite book from it as well. If like me you remember these books and show as a child and are looking for a little nostalgia, this will not disappoint. The stories are just enough different from the series that it will not be just like reading the t.v. show. This one was interesting because it is the only time they incorporate a story line of good vs. evil that does not really orbit around the Cylons but between a devil like entity and heavenly entities that seem to be fighting each other for the souls of the fleet, unbeknownst to the ""rag, tag, fugitives""."
2,Holds phone well for a few months,"Holds the phone well for a few months untils the clips on the side loosen and break. After that happens, the phone falls out pretty easily. (and you realize the 8700c bunces and still keeps working) I ended up replacing it with a different holster from RIM that has a magnetic clasp. (The replcement works great)"
2,"Good, But Flawed","This is a very basic holster, and often simple is best - but not this time. The good news: the 8700 slips right in and out with ease, the swivel works great, and the clip is reasonably secure. A minor issue, becuase its plastic, when the virbrate ""ring"" is active, it makes an annoying rattle sound.The real problem is that the 8700 is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs (one on each side). Everyday use must weaken the plastic, becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my case, which meant that they 8700 would not stay put. It slipped out and fell to the floor several times. I replaced the case, and a month later, the tabs on the new case broke too.Due to cheap build quality, I'd suggest you look at third-party case options instead of this one."
2,Very bad,I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in the box the blackberry came in there was a plastic case I tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did I tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic. The reason I gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call. I suggest you get a leather on they work alot better!
5,A Great Collection Of Rick Springfield's Hits!,"I was browsing in my local music store and noticed this excellent collection of Rick Springfield hits. I always liked Rick Springfield's music, especially his eighties material for which the bulk of this collection focuses on. It includes all his hits such as Jessie's Girl, I've Done Everything For You, Affair Of The Heart, Love Is Alright Tonight, Human Touch, Don't Talk To Strangers, Bop 'Til You Drop plus 12 more songs. This is a pretty complete collection of his hits at a very reasonable price (I paid close to what Amazon sells this disc for) and it's also an import."
1,Rotten Egg in a Mirror!,"I not only have seen this movie but, at the time it was being filmed, I was living right next door to my neighbors home which was used as the Riggs residence and let me tell you that the character of Karen was probably paterned after my former neighbor. Everything from Karen being an antique dealer to the closet scene in which all of the shoes are shown, to where she freaks out and acts like a total psycho. The Director of this movie more than likely quizzed her pretty exstensively before filming began. I can only tell you that this movie was put together quickly and what you see in the end is a result of this. So if you wanna see a stinker of a movie filled with lots of bad acting and a stupid plot line, then this is the movie for you."
2,Hands on Baby Massage,"Hands on Baby Massage - Was not in as good a shape as described, quite shabby, wrinkled and discolored, but usable. Not overly impressed."
2,Watch does not keep good time,"I bought this watch because it was beautiful in appearance, yet inexpensive. It worked for awhile, however, after I had a jeweler install a fresh battery, it began to lose time so badly that I stopped wearing it. It's a great looking watch, but sadly, probably not worth the money."
1,"Good looking, but didn't last very long",Not a bad looking watch for casual use. Has a nice feel and seems well made. But looks can be deceiving. In it's short lifetime in my pocket I had to replace the battery once and interpolate between 4 and 6 to know when it was dinner time because the numeral 5 fell of the dial. Then it abruptly stopped working. It's last utility was to fill a small void in the trash bag.
5,More Stars! I need more Stars!,"This is the first Martin Hayes CD I purchased, and it has spoiled me not only for other Irish fiddle players, but for other CD's of his as well. This is just sooo fine! The emotional and dynamic range are just unparalleled. This is not the speed-for-speed's-sake playing of some others, it's evocative, lyrical and just plain tasty. Get it and enjoy!"
2,Fossil Men's Watch #AM3878,"Very nice looking watch, except it's too large - unless you like large watches."
2,did not fit well,"I searched the parts and see whether it fits my car. Amazon system showed that the parts fit my car. However, when the PCV valve came, the upper extrimity was smaller and shorter than the original one. I have to tape it and then put it in my car. Its not a safe way to use it like that."
4,Great for stroller,This is a great concept. It provides activity for the baby and has a slot for the bottle.
3,Schools beware,"My school purchased these books 2 years ago. The content is great. However, after 2 years of use, a quarter of them are almost trashed. The binding does NOT stay on. It is far too heavy of a book for the binding it has. It easily pulls away from the book. One drop to the floor and it has substantial damage."
2,doesn't sink in!,"I got this in a sampler set and tried it out. It's not your average foot cream since its not actually creamy but more like vaseline. I put it on before bed (with socks, like they said) and by morning it still hasn't sunk in. Yes, it's not gooey anymore, but it leaves a gross-feeling film on my feet that I need to wash off if I'm going sock-less. It does moisturize very well, which might be due to its real ""staying power."" Plus, I'm not a fan of coconut-scented things. If you like that vaseline-y feeling, try Vitamins A&E ointment (it's sold next to the diaper rash ointment in most stores). It's cheaper and actually sinks in!"
5,Useful overview of topics,"This book gives an excellent review of microvias and WLCSP technologies, with real-world examples from the electronic packaging industry. It focuses largely on how to create effective & reliable low-cost, high density interconnects in modern high speed system designs. It provides a sufficient amount of theory so that the the reader can understand the fundamental issues assosiated with high density interconnection. It's a comprehensive book with the ability to keep you satisfied no matter what you are looking for."
2,"Okay, But So What?","Books like this are all the same. They suggest that cosmology and the Bible don't have to conflict so long as you take creation story metaphorically. Fine, but so what? The truth is that a lot of religious people don't want to take the creation story metaphorically for fear of going down the slippery slope of taking the whole Bible metaphorically, which is really the only reasonable way to take it. But if the whole Bible is a metaphor, how can it be the Divine word?"
5,ello,"you made need to run screen spanning doctor if you want anything other than mirroring. after running that, i was able to extend my desktop from the built in 17"" 1440x900 screen on the imac to a separate 21"" 1680x1050 monitor. i have so much more room to breath now."
1,Apple Mini-VGA to VGA Display Adapter,"This adapter did not fit the mini-VGA port on my Mac Mini. Apple apparently uses more than one size of mini-VGA port on their various models of computers. Amazon made no mention of that in their product description. Amazon needs to be more accurate and complete in their product descriptions. Amazon also charged me for the return shipping costs, even though my decision to buy this product was based on their incomplete description of this product. Buyer beware!!"
2,confused,"is not that i expect. The picture of these product was similar, that the display that i need, but when the product arrive, wasn't the same."
5,Works for me.,"This cable has been working for me, only issue worth mentioning is that my iMac 800mhz has a frozen refresh rate of 75hz, cannot be changed with any 3rd party software. This results in some very light, barely noticeable scan lines on my 120hz Vizio HDTV. Now I'm quite sure that a better quality HDTV does a better job of converting the refresh rates in order to make a solid image on the screen, and either way it works. Because the max resolution on my mac is 1024x768, the image on the TV is not super sharp, but it's not blurry either. If you plan to use this cable to connect an external monitor, I'm sure that it will work absolutely perfectly. I bought mine used and it has been working perfectly for several months. I don't doubt that some of these cables end up working poorly (according to various reviews) but then again the world is full of people who don't know what they are doing, am I right? I bought a coaxial SVGA cable and have had no issues. Peace."
4,Fascinating and disturbing,"Tight, well-written short stories about contemporary life. A unique, compelling new voice in fiction."
1,Don't buy these!! Amazon shouldn't let them sell on their site!,"I bought this in January, but didn't need it until March. I doesn't work at all and messed up my printer. I can't return it because it is passed the Amazon 30 day return policy. I called the number on the box and it is disconnected. What a rip-off. Amazon shouldn't let them sell defective merchandise on their site!"
5,Here Comes Summer by Jerry Paul Keller,Jerry is my cousin. I haven't seen him since 1965. But my two favorite songs he did was Bee Bee Baby and Faster the Better. He also played back up guitarist for Dibbie Boone in the song You Light Up My Life.If anyone knows how it get in touch with him have have contact me.
4,Underestimated ballad,"""Drowned world..."" opens Madonna's ""Ray of light"" album and a new chapter in her carrier. It's futuristic sound makes it a really special ballad in her collection.Unfortunately, this song was never released in the States and in Europe was cause of some kind of commotion due to its video (Lady Di-kind of-story, chasing papparazzi etc.).The truth is, it's a very good track and this single proves it.It contains a long (more than 9 min) remix by BT and Sasha - excellent!+ edited remix of ""Sky fits heaven"" by Sasha alone.Both songs match each other well. I wish there was a proper maxi single with all available mixes of those two tracks."
1,Boring atomic spying,"I thought that a book about the H-bomb would have Teller, Ulam, Sakharov, Stalin and Truman as the main figures. No, it is about some obscure atomic spies: spying for the A-bomb, not the H-bomb !!!!! The H-bomb appears shortly in the end of the book. A real dissapointment, because it also fails as a spy novel."
3,"Good, but not as good as ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb""","The title is a little deceptive. The development of the H-bomb doesn't start until the book is 3/4 over, most of the book covers the Soviet A-bomb program and the associated Soviet spies.It's still a must read for students of the Cold War."
3,A somewhat misleading book,"I was disappointed in this book. It was primarily a history of Soviet Espionage in the atomic era with very little in the way of history and details about the hydrogen bomb. It details recollections of Soviet Spies in mind-numbing detail throughout the development of the atomic bomb, with very little attention devoted to the time during the development of the hydrogen bomb. I think the title of the book is completely misleading. I give it 3 stars because if the history of atomic espionage is your thing, this book is for you. Also because I was startled by the extent and reach of Soviet intelligence. But this is not why I bought the book."
3,Sometimes innacurrate,"On all things directly nuclear and related to Los Alamos this is quite interesting. But Rhodes often branches out to wider bits of history, and often gets those wrong. For instance his entire discussion of MacArthur's dismissal is innacurate; he claims the joint chiefs wanted to keep him and only agreed to let Truman's firing him if they could deploay bombs to the pacific. This is wrong. See for instance Weintraub's recent ""MacArthur's War"" for a detailed account.Some of Rhodes's other arguments in places are contradictory.Lots of interesting stuff though."
5,"A dramatic story of spies, bombs, personnel and politics","Richard Rhodes is a gifted writer and historian. This sequel to The Making of the Atomic Bomb tell the story of the arms race, the cold war and the unique personalities involved as the USSR and the USA sought to build the H bomb. It makes clear that Klaus Fuchs was instrumental in giving the USSR vital information from Los Alamos which enabled it to build an H bomb years earlier then predicted. The fall of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scary thinking of Gen Curtis LeMay and brutality of Stalin are set forth in well documented style."
5,Detailed yet absolutely gripping,"Rhodes' earlier ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" won a Pulitzer prize; I thought this was even better. The first part is an account of Soviet espionage into the Manhattan project; Rhodes lets us in on all the mundane details while allowing the inherent drama to come through in full force.The second part was even more of a revelation: I never thought the nature of the ""technically sweet"" innovation that saved theH-bomb project would be revealed to the public during my lifetime, but it's spelled out here. I also never thought I'd understand in detail how an H-bomb works, but Rhodes makes it both comprehensible and fascinating.Chapter 24 is the heart of the book--a description of the Mike shot, the world's first thermonuclear explosion. Don't start reading it if you have to go somewhere soon. A classic case of ""I couldn't put it down""."
4,What on earth were we thinking!?,"While perhaps not as engaging as Mr. Rhodes' ""The Making of the A-Bomb"", this book will occasionally surprise the reader with some utterly frightening passages.Did you know, for instance, that the yield from one of the early thermonuclear tests went out of control? Did you know that the US came within days of authorizing the use of nuclear weapons in the Korean war?The only thing I found lacking in this book was a closer study of the effects of the tests themselves. A scientific creation of this magnitude deserves more study. Mr. Rhodes spends more time on the political chess game between the US and the USSR than on the science behind the development of the bomb (although there is a great deal of technical information)."
3,So-So Gathering of Guitar Rock Hits,"The best part about this CD is that it brings together a few difficult to locate guitar-oriented songs in their original versions: ""Only You Know and I Know,"" ""Don't Misunderstand Me,"" and ""The Pusher."" Most of the others can be found on better compilations. Caveat emptor: ""Johnny B. Goode"" by Chuck Berry is a live version, but the others are genuine recordings, including the full version of ""Free Bird"" in its original studio version."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"We knew we were doomed with this book when, on the very first day of our trip to Manhattan, we walked into a recommended ""authentic NY"" pizza joint, took one look around and realized everyone in the place was a tourist. The pizza was gross, overpriced and left us feeling like huge suckers.This book bills itself as the ""insider's"" guide to Manhattan, but it consistently let us down with restaurants and attractions. It also didn't give us a great idea which neighborhoods or areas are dangerous, or best avoided at night, etc. The maps are minimal enough to be almost worthless, and we could have used a lot more information on how to use the subway system. This book is definitely not worth the money."
2,disappointing,I bought this for my 15 month old granddaughter whose favorite things are books. I also bought two other books by this author. My granddaughter ignores them all and moves away to some other activity when I try to read them with her. Maybe its because they are not colorful and the drawings don't connect with her. Perhaps these are good for older children.
4,We like it!,Our 15 month old likes looking at the pictures in this book and we like reading/singing it to him. Sometimes he'll ask for it over and over again.
5,Barnyard Dance!,"This book is so much fun! You'll want to read it over and over and over. Every kid will love it (from 1 to 101). It is great to watch the kids really get into it and start to do the Barnyard Dance all of the time. Once your toes start tappin' they will never want to stop. Parts of the book repeat themselve but it also keeps you on your toes with a simple little twist here and there. It's not to long, so even the youngest little one will love it over and over again."
5,Barnyard Dance!,My 18-month old daughter loves this book! When I read it to her she starts stomping and clapping around the room. It's so much fun to watch her and dance with her too!
4,My 2 year old loves it.,"My two year old girl literally ""bows"" to the horse and ""bows"" to the cow and then she twirls and it goes on and on. She interacts with this book every time we read it. It's so upbeat and fun. We first took it out of the library and it broke my heart to have to return it. So I came here and ordered her her very own copy. I can't wait for her baby brother to engage in this book soon too."
5,"Adults, you'll love storytime again (oh, and kids like it too)","This book must be read out loud. Did I say read? I actually meant chant, sing, dance this book. It's a great way to warm things up, get shy kids involved, burn off extra energy and just have a good time. I have so much fun with this book. Luckily, the kids love it too!"
5,WONDERFUL!,Barnyard Dance has become a family favorite! We read it aloud - like a square dance caller & the kids (& sometimes adults) dance around acting out the story! A great interaction book!
5,ANOTHER WINNER FROM SANDRA,"Sandra Boyntons books have become favorites in our house for our 2 1/2 year old. Barnyard Dance is another hit. This, like her other books have their trademark hilarious and silly illustrations as barnyard animals big and small dance about as a cow plays a fiddle. Accompanying the colorful and lively illustrations is sandra's witty and whimsical rhymes. Cows, ducks, chickens, pigs, horses, sheep...all singing and dancing about. Kids just get a big kick out of all of it. Great fun and fun to read.This is one of those very sturdy board books that will stand up to any abuse your young one can throw at it. Another winner from Sandra!"
5,great book!!,"This book has great rhymes and a fun cadence! My daughter loves the pictures and, at a year old, loves to flip through the pages ""reading"" it to herself. Like all Boynton books, this one is a keeper!"
4,my niece loved it,"I bought this book for my niece for Christmas, and when it came in the mail, I flipped through it. I wasn't really impressed, as it just seemed like another children's book, with animals dancing, and ""moo"", and ""baa"" and whatnot. I suppose the important thing is that my niece loves it, and judging by the other reviews here, your child will probably love it too."
5,The Best of Boynton,"If someone were to ask us to pick our favorite Sandra Boynton book, it would be very difficult, since they are all wonderful, but this one would probably edge out the others by a little. It's fun, and playful, and full of animals. We ""sing"" it like a real square dance, and clap, and our son just loves it. He even points to every animal and names them now, even says ""cluck-cluck-cluck!"" with the chickens! The funny thing is, my husband and I really get a kick out of reading it, too. It's a FUN book! If you are trying to decide which Boynton book to buy, you have to get this one. Then you'll be hooked and you'll need to have them all!"
5,Best Yet,"If you can read it without a ""square dance"" rythmn in your voice then more power to you!! This is Ms Boynton's best children's book! Very fun for parent and child."
5,Fun To Dance To!,"As with all of Boynton's books, it's great fun to read! We like to ""sing"" it and dance along. My son loves all of her books and from the time he could move independently he would find them and ""read"" them to himself."
5,"Can't stop reciting this book aloud, even when no kids are around","I had an unreasonable amount of fun reading this book aloud to my little ones. In fact, I think I love it more than they do. I also find myself reciting the words mindlessly while doing housework. Sandra Boynton is always fun, but this one may be my favorite (tough call -- might be a tie with ""Personal Penguin"" as sung by Davy Jones). Fans of Chicka Chicka Boom Boom will love it."
5,Cute book,I love this author. Her books are educational and very entertaining. I hope to buy more of her books in the near future.
5,A Children's Classic!,"This book has very nice rhythm that makes it very enjoyable for 3-year-old toddlers. This book reminds me of one that I recently bought called ""One, Two, Three: This Book's for Me"" by Stuart Samuel, which also has a distintive cadence. Both books center on farm features and imaginery. Both are excellent."
5,Fun!,"Love, love, love Sandra Boynton books. My son is only 4 months old and even though he doesn't understand the words I am reading, because Sandra writes so rhythmically he is totally engaged. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Favorite Baby Shower Gift,"Barnyard Dance is such a fun little book, and one that I have purchased over and over again for gifts. This book was a favorite of my two daughters. We read and re-read this book and they loved the sing-song way it is written."
5,VERY Fun!,"This is my favorite children's book of all time! Any parent or grandparent out there HAS to get this book! It's got a sing-songy kind of beat to it so you can either read it or sing it. My 2 year old son even stomps his feet and claps his hands when ever i read or sing this book to him. I love this author! Another book we enjoy of hers is ""But not the Hippopotamus"". I've even found myself cleaning the house and picking this book up off the floor and reading it myself! But beware-- This book will never make it to the bookshelf! It's that great!"
1,15 month old son doesn't like the Boynton books at all,"we've got most of the boynton books. even though he greatly enjoys books in general, the boynton books he has never warmed up to. he simply can't stand them - shoves them out of the way and reaches for another book as soon as we open the 2nd page. of all the boynton books, i myself find this one the least interesting visually and the text is insipid. my favorite of her books is hippos go berserk. son doesn't care if it either, though."
2,Pretty disappointing for Shell-Head's first solo video game,"When my 6-year-old son and I saw that Ol' Tin-Britches was FINALLY getting his own video game, we were SOOO excited!! Sadly, the fantastic coverbox artwork is the coolest thing about this standard side-scrolling shoot-the-badguys formulaic time-killer. Sad to say that Shell-Head's first solo outing is standard game fare from a standard of about 10 years ago. If you're sick of the side-scrolling beat-'em-ups, avoid this one! Do yourself a favor and hunt up a good copy of ""Captain America and the Avengers"" were Iron Man was treated like the heavy-hitter he is!!"
2,wait,im a iron man fan and all i can say is by 2007 the new iron man movie will be out along with a video game so buy it then
4,This Book Is Worth It!,"I found this book very useful since it assists the practictioner with the problem of explaining ""concepts"" that are virtually untranslatable. Though there may be a few quibbles with some of the trsanslation, Dahl does an excellent job of helping to understand concepts. For example, his explanation of ""Discovery"" and its scope and limits is brilliant. It is a very useful tool to explain such concepts to the non-U.S. person who has little understanding of the complexities of U.S. law. I highly recommend this book."
4,Just what I was looking for!,"These were just the stencils I was looking for! The only problem I had with them was the paint would run as soon as you tried to move the stencil, or even just leaving the stencil in place. You just have to go back and neaten it up a little bit when you are done. Great product, great price!"
2,Not As Good As Trevor's Weight Loss CD,"I purchased Trevor Scott's weight loss CD and liked it a lot. So, I thought I'd buy this one. However, I didn't find the visualizations and the suggestions quite as good."
3,Not quite a soundtrack,"First of all, this is mislabled as a soundtrack album and it clearly is not, being recorded in stereo. the original soundtrack album would not be recorded in stereo as it was recorded in 1948 long before the invention of stereo.still, it does contain the major themes of this great western classic, one of the best ever.By this time, Tiomkin was established as a western composer and a fine one as later scores would testify.But it is with Red River he and actor John Wayne came of age. Whoever said John Wayne couldn't act only needs to watch this, and several later movies, such as Island in the Sky and The High and the Mighty, to find this out.Still, it will do until a real soundtrack album can be produced. Are you reading this, Film Score Monthly?"
3,Only lovers of full scores will love this overlong selection,"Other than the main themes I found this score a little too long and with all the small cues. It may or may not deserve the attention it got. Orchestral playing is excellent. And Dimitri Tiomkin deserves this accolade to his talent. His scores for Guns of Navarone and for Friendly Persuasion and for The Thing, for High Noon, for Lost Horizon by RCA as a collection and lots of others are more lyrically interesting. But that is one person's opinion. I love the movie itself. I did not go wild over the whole score with all its small cues, just some of the main themes like Off the Missouri song and theme. I give it a 3 star and a good item for Tiomkin musicographers, but not a play and play again item."
3,Dimensions are a little tricky,"I wish I had paid attention to the review before I purchased this item.I too thought it was going to be larger than it turned out to be, due to the ""4.5 x 7.5 inch"" added to the measurements. Apparently, the 4.5 x 7.5 inches concerns the package and has nothing to do with the cupcake topper itself. Since they do not show a picture of the package, and only a picture of one topper, it is a little misleading.Yes, I should have paid more attention, but since I was in a rush, I only saw the second two measurements and thought it was a cake topper, not a cupcake topper.If you are looking for cupcake toppers, they seem very nice. If you need something for a larger cake, this is not it."
1,Very Misleading and Disappointing--Bait-and-Switch Scam,I was extremely disappointed when I opened the package and found 6 very small toppers rather than the 1 larger one I was expecting. Even in the product description it states the measurements are: 1.5 X 4.8 X 7.8. Not sure where they are getting those measurements. I feel like this is a real bait-and-switch scam. I will never order from this vendor again.
2,a waste of time.,"Very Lame Movie.Six young men riding around town in a snot green cadillac with nothing to do but get high and over use the""N"" word to finally win a recording contract, poorly done."
5,The Toothbrush in the stone!,"In this episode, Brushbrush, the toothbrush (duh) gets caught in a stone and can't get out, so everybody in the village tries to pull him out, but fails. I liked it when the Cavity Goon covered Brushbrush in liquid soap, so Timmy couldn't pull him out. That part was funny."
5,croce is a hit,"the sound of this cd rivals anything out there it sounds as if he is in your living room , the song selection is some of his less well known mellower stuff (which i prefer). if you already have his hits ,this is a must"
2,"ok, but not good on it's own",This book explains some of what you need to know for the GRE but: 1) contains a lot of information that you don't need 2)explains only some of what you need and just lists the rest so you have to seek out another book and look that information up. I found Princeton Review to be much more helpful
4,"Seriously useful, but this shouldn't be your only source","This book provides a comprehensive overview of the topic areas that ETS expects you to have down. Its major strength is the diagnostic tests which effectively focus your review on your weak points. If, like me, you're prone to skip the less interesting stuff, the test results broken down by topic area provide excellent motivation to pay a little more attention! However, I would not recommend this as a sole source for GRE studying. You'll need a decent intro psych textbook (obviously) and some official test questions. The questions in this book's tests are not in ETS format. However, I found GRE Psychology a useful adjunct to my GRE preparation."
1,"Dense, useless, incomplete.","You should not be spending this much time on review. Barron's book is just an intro psyc text book minus the pictures. Look for something that reviews instead of trying to teach. This book was a waste of time and money. I got a 730, but it was no thanks to this books. Major concepts that were on the actual test were not in this book. Use an intro text book, ignore this book."
1,"If you can find something else, get it!","Barron's general GRE prep book was a great help, but their prep guide for the psychology test was more or less useless to me. I couldn't believe how bad some of the item writing was. I certainly hope the ETS people have better sense when it comes to writing items. I did WORSE on the practice tests after I did a week and a half of studying."
1,This prep guide is the worst of the worst,"I found this book to be AWFUL! The Psychology review was filled with Tables and recommended you to look them all up in an intro to psyc book. I used this book for 1 week and bought 2 new books. I used Arco's GRE Psychology and the ETS Practicing to take the Psychology Test. These two were very useful. Arco's review was very comprehensive, without the minor details that are not covered on the test."
5,great rally game,"I really love this game. The graphics and sound are great. There are many options including career mode and arcade style. If you like driving games, this should be on your list."
5,My cats love these,These are the best little balls. There are cut out vents that allow the cats to more easily grab them with their paws or teeth. I think they also enjoy the jingle bell in the middle. One of our cats plays fetch and the other plays keep away... works well for both games.
4,Good but too much science for me,"Those who lean more towards the science part of the SF/F genre will love the complex explinations of this book. In contrast, I am a devote fan of fantasy, and I may have startled those around me when I started yelling, many times, about hard sci-fi while reading the book. The obvious plot seems to be replaced with more of the emotional tension that Ringo is good at and scientific explinations. If you've gotten this far in the series, go ahead and read it.I liked this book and, I'm sad that I let the negative reviews on this site prevent me from reading it for so long. It's not as complex plot-wise as the other books, but I definitly look forward to the next one."
2,Dissapointing,"This book is horrible. This is nothing but a short story that is full of page fillers. I buy everything that ringo puts out before its on the stands and have supported him on his bad ghost reviews but this book is bad. This advances nothing in the series at all except killing off one of the evil sides keyholders. One of the big questions in the previous book hasnt been touched: what of the elf queens response to the evils side messing with elf geense (growing elf deomonds) Lost is magic that kept the series interesting like 1. the great jokes, 2. the chaotic rabbit 3. the wood elf girl. The first book in the series was a great refreshing taste. But the quality of each preceding book has dwindled. John you need to go back to David Weber and ask him how he does it. His last book ""At all Costs"" was fantastic. Im sorry all your co-authored books are great though."
1,Just awful,"As most of the reviewers of this book, I loved his early works.Of late, starting with Cally's war, John Ringo, has diviated from writing good solid exciting adventure science fiction, to,sad to say, thrashy soft porn, masquerading as thrillers.This book is no exception. Thin plot, boring story line. It was all I could do to finish it. I doubt I will be buying any moreof his books. I gave this one star as there is no option for'no stars'."
3,A Letdown,I really enjoyed John Ringo's Council War Series. It was a very creative and interesting universe in which to set a story line. That made this book a bit of a disappointment. It was nowhere near as enjoyable and the previous 3 books.The council ruling earth is still divided into warring factions. Both sides critically need energy and think it might be obtained by capturing an automated spaceship bring back fuel from the outer solar system. Both sides plan a mission. One side fights dirty. Both have bits of high tech to leven out a basically feudal society.This book could have been much more. I hope that future installments will live up to the potential. This one did not.
3,A bit on the short side,"The book seemed a bit short to me, sort of like WTDD from the Posleen series, with the majority of the book being spent in preparation for the mission and a few chapters covering the action, which may be realistic for military ops but somehow isn't as satisfying as previous books in this series. Also like WTDD, it's apparent that the real action is just getting started when the book ends, although there's closure on the Icarus mission. I purchased the e-book version on Baen's web site and considered it worth the six bucks, but mostly I'm eager to read the next book and see how things turn out.I could compare this book to /Yendi/ by Steven Brust--a good book in an excellent series which doesn't pull together as many angles as we're accustomed to. Temporary blip.-Max Wilson"
4,Fun fun fun!,"I read the reviews on this book and was actually thinking I might not bother, Lord was I glad I did. I think too many people have hidden goals to be some famous critic and have forgotten to just go with the story and enjoy the ride. I had some good laughs and was drawn in hard when the action hit the fan, and as for Herzer's sex life, well it was a part of all the others so why the heck not this one?God I hope John Ringo keeps going with this, I am having too much fun to stop now! :)BTW I would have given it 5 stars but Herzer should have gotten more nookie ;) LOL"
1,Brazilian Imports are the Worst,"The DVD that I ordered came from Brazil, and when I played it, it was very bad. There is an error with the cover, because Rick Vito and Billy Burnette were not in the concert, but are feautured on the cover. Also, the DVD has terrible picture and sound. If I had known the condition that the footage was going to be, I would have never ordered it. Even though I love Fleetwood Mac, and an trying to collect as much memorabilia as I can, it was a mistake to buy this DVD."
1,DON'T DON'T DON'T ! !,"The DVD that I ordered came from Brazil, and when I played it, it was very bad.DVD has terrible picture and sound. If I had known the condition that the footage was going to be, I would have never ordered it. Even though I love Fleetwood Mac. A waste!"
5,DVD Cover Photo,I purchased the VHS version of the Mirage Live video when it was originally released. I have always wondered why Fleetwood Mac had not released this video in DVD format. I do not know if this was ever offially released by Warner Bros. What concerns me most is the photo on the cover of this DVD. The photo includes Rick Vito and Billy Burnette who joined Fleetwood Mac in 1987 on the Tango in the Night Tour after Lindsey Buckingham left Fleetwood Mac. The Mirage Tour was in 1982 when Lindsey Buckingham as active member. I am curious if anyone knows why this photo was used instead of the original that appeared on the VHS video. The use of this photo concerns me that this may not be an authorixed version of this video.
3,for die hard fleetwood mac fans only!,"I must admit when I first put this dvd into my player I was pretty shocked about how bad it sounded. I new instantly that this was an unauthorized concert. After excepting that fact I let myself just enjoy it for what it was. Being the huge mac fan that I am I was happy to see anything live from the early years of fleetwood mac. That being said there were some other dissapointments I had with this concert, mainly the consistancy of the preformances. For example, at times while nicks is singing gypsy she sounds like a dying lamb, on the other hand her performance of rhiannon is outstanding. Buckingham does a great job on go your own way, but over indulges on its not that funny. Mcvie is good as usual but doesnt get to do enough of her materiel,I would have much rather heard say you love me over its not that funny. all in all worth having only if your a huge fan otherwise you can skip this one."
3,For those that remember the original HBO concert,"To be more specific, this is the 90-minute version of the show that was released in 1983 on VHS by RCA-Columbia Home Video. The HBO version was actually less than 60 minutes. Regardless, this is basically a bootleg rip of a VHS copy - good if you need it, otherwise pass if you only have a passing interest. ""The Dance"" may be more appropriate if you want a better-quality greatest hits collection. Sound and audio quality is no different than if you found one of the original VHS tapes at Goodwill, so you have been warned. And, as many others have previously mentioned, the band line-up on the cover are not period-correct, it's actually the line-up that did the ""Tango In The Night"" Tour in 1987 - a tour that was also filmed for Showtime, televised the following year."
2,APBT Book Review,"A general guide to the Apbt, the history sections of all Stratton's books are exellent, but that is history.a large part of the rest of this book should be for looking at the pictures, as quite a bit of the information is not the best for a new pit bull owner, there are a lot of misconceptionsabout the true trainability & potential of this great breed, for purposes other than fighting.A book that would cover this very well, is the Working Pit Bullby Diane Jessup."
2,Inconsistencies,Quite frankly I am tired of this series which is written by too many people or one very confused person. There are inconsistencies in the writing and the whole series. This title alone is called Book 6 and Book 14 and many of the other titiles are the same. Don't waste your time
4,FIERCE!!!,"Another wonderful house CD from this great label - I especially love the Johnny Vicious remix of Marshall Jefferson. I play this CD before going out to clubs to get me into the mood...I just had to get it after having bought Coolcuts 2, which is one of my favorite compilations..."
2,Really nice.,Really nice looking. It is in my laundry room and looks great. It keeps jackets close to door and off the floor.
5,Really well made,I just redid all my bathrooms and was hesitant to buy without seeing in person. I was so pleasantly surprised on the quality as well as the are in shipping..
4,Great quality,"Wish it was a little bit bigger, but it looks great hanging next to our door, and I like the quality. Would give 5 stars if they would include mounting screws."
3,It looks nice but hooks are not large,"I put 2 of these at our cabin and although they look good, the hooks are not large. I was hoping to use it as a towel rack in the bathroom but it's a little small for that. Also, it does NOT come with hanging hardware."
5,A Little Prairie Flower,"This Centenary Issue spans the period 1926 to 1940, and presents Elsie Carlisle with a diversity of accompaniments, foremost being Jay Wilbur, but featuring also Ray Starita & his Ambassadors, Ambrose, and Jack Harris. Many of the songs have become standards, others deserve to be better remembered, and some are notorious! Elsie was a versatile singer, whose repertoire embraced ballads, torch songs, and comedy numbers, but she also covered risqué songs, like ""My Handy Man"" and ""My Man O' War"". Which makes this probably the most comprehensive guide to all those facets of her art. NOTE: The title is Radio Sweetheart No. 1"
4,Udo Is Still Restless And Wild. **** 4 Star Essential Metal!,"This is a very easy CD to sum up: if you loved any Accept, especially, Death Row, you'll love all U.D.O.-especially this one. Trademark voice that had you banging your head back in the Balls To The Wall days, will do the same here. Guitars crunch in an ultra-heavy way, while still forcing you to air guitar, no matter how old you are, Accept-style solos, solid metal drumming, and the voice of Udo, will delight any fan-no doubt. Why not 5 stars? Only because it didn't hit me in the songwriting department the way that Metal Heart did, or old Accept classics, like Princess of The Dawn. It still jams like a mother, and deserves to be in the CD rack of any and all U.D.O./Accept fans. **** 4 STAR U.D.O. RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF POWER METAL, USA."
2,Silly,I'm amazed looking at the other reviews for this book that they are all so good. I was very disappointed in this book. I have read several other John Saul books and this is by far the worst I've read. I found it slow moving and the premise weak. The ending seemed as though the whole exercise of writing the thing had been so painful he just wanted to be done with it.I will say that it's been many years since I last read a John Saul book and I may have just grown out of them.
3,average....,I read this book a while ago...and I liked it until the end...the ending was weak....and I thought that it was very childish..something that you would expect out of a book written for a 13 year old...not sure if I would read another book by this author...
4,"engrossing and then horrifically sad, sensitive beware","I would have liked to give this book a lower rating than a 4, however, it is so well written then you can picture the events and during the story you grow to understand and like the characters so much, that it deserves at least a 5 just for that reason. No one can deny that Mr. Saul is a very good writer. The reason I reduced the rating is because of content. As I said, you come to genuinely care about the characters. There are a lot of children in the book, those are the characters I most cared about. The problem is that children start to get killed in particularly horrific manners -- one sweet child who died in the book, could have been spared and the book would have been fabulous. The death, a grisly one, was not necessary to the plot, and did not help in the building of the conclusion.I was so upset by this book at the end that I swore I would never read another book by Mr. Saul."
5,One of Saul's Best!,"I can't understand what the other reviewers meant when they said this was not as good a book as they expected. I've read all of Saul's older novels and this one by far has stuck with me. It has all the characters and setting to make for a book unable to put down. I read this until the wee hours of the morning and the setting description and the story plot sent shivers up my spine. This book does differ from Saul's other book by way of the ""villain."" Unlike his other stories that have the evil twist this is unique in that the ""villain"" is inhuman. The setting was described so realistically that I could picture the snow on the ground with the moon barley peeking over the wooded tree tops. You could ""feel"" the eyes watching you from the dead of night and see the ""breath"" on the glass from outside. Truly engaging!!!! A must read."
4,Alright,"Even though I didn't really like this book, it actually gave me a nightmare while camping. Thus, Guardian gets 4 stars instead of 3 since it seemed to have a lasting effect.Anyways, the book wasn't bad, but wasn't that great IMO. I'm just not a big fan of werewolf stuff - so maybe that's why I didn't care for the book much... Parts also seemed repetitive & I just did not care for the main woman character (Maryanne). By the end I seemed to sympathize more w/ the villain/s.Also, the ending seemed to be dragged out or something. However, I did like how it left you to speculate about what would happen in future."
4,This book got to me !,This book pulls you in. Like most Saul books the characters are REAL. You meet them and relate to them in the first half of the book. You like them and pray nothing will happen to tear their fragile world appart. That was a first for me. After the first half of the book my opinion of Maryanne compleatly changed. This book is REALY GOOD. I deducted one star because I cried.
4,The book captured me within minutes,"This was the first John Saul book I have ever read. It Wowed me so much, that ever since I have be finding and reading anything and everthing written by Saul. The story is easy to read (with 1 or 2 slightly slow parts) and keeps you turning pages long into the night. The characters are very well developed and even though it is ""supernatural"" in contant he really leads you to believe that it is real. Let me say one thing, out of the 12 Saul books I've read, I have never been disappointed!"
3,"Good on history, weak on the arts","The historical overview chapters are of interest as an annotated bibliographic guide to finding specific texts on dimensions of Jewish history and theology. The book ends in a real klinker: The final chapter, on Jewish American Literature, is turgid, judgmental, and pretty useless to consult for new finds. Instead of guiding readers, the literary guide codifies the importance of Bellow, Malamud, and Roth, while attacking some of the best books of both Bellow and Roth."
1,"Great Band, Lousy DVD","I, too, have enjoyed NRBQ's live shows. I remember seeing them open for Bonnie Raitt on the Common in Boston when she included ""Me And The Boys"" on her Green Light album. It was even better seeing them on stage at the Paradise on Comm Ave when they were so close you could pass them a beer!So it pains me terribly to say that the crappy video gear and lousy sound recorders employed in the production of this DVD made it impossible for me to even get through the whole thing.If anybody wants a copy cheap, I have a deal for you......"
2,there are better books on the market,"According to the previous positive reviews, this should be a great book. I don't think so! Quite honestly, there is a lot more valuable information on the internet, than what you can learn from this book. It seems to be written for children and there is really nothing extraordinary aboutthe information presented in the book. It's basic stuff for neophytes. Don't buy it, surf the net, download the info and save a few bucks."
3,Amazing title track and some good B sides,"Not a bad singlePolley is a good song, nothing special but a good b sideIronical is a bit of an acoustic number again not a massive standoutJohn Callahan is a terrific bside, has somewhat of a moody jazz feel to it with a feel of doom throughout the music, very very different but very good all the same.Buy for the title track and John Callahan"
2,Money better spent elsewhere,"I found the video hard to follow and annoyingly cheesy. Carradine's ridiculous shiny blue suit distracts one from the moves, which are poorly shot, as if the production of the show was more important than teaching the moves. This is not a serious Tai Chi lesson."
2,"Can't agree more with ""Beware of Stamina Products""","I received my Stamina Products Adjustable Hyperextension Bench on March 13th of '07 and was very disappointed. There was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box. The product was scratched and parts were broken.Fortunately the bench works, but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage. The product seems to be of quality, it's just unfortunate that SPS doesn't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap."
5,I love my SSP Hyper Extension Bench,"My Back was aching so even after reading some of the negative reviews, I took a chance and purchased this unit. The price was great and I wanted an adjustable unit and this one appeared very similar to the one in the Health Club that I go to. The item arrived within three days of purchase and the box was ""very"" heavy and a bit ""beat up"" on the outside. Upon opening the box, I completed an inventory of the parts and everything needed to assemble the unit was there and not scratched or dented like some of the other customers have commented. It took about an hour to assemble and this is one heavy duty piece of gym equipment. I typically do not provide feedback on purchases, but I am just so pleased with this unit that i wanted to add a positive comment to the seller's feedback rating. I use it every day in the morning and evening and my back thanks me for it. I would highly recommend this unit to all."
5,"True love, true writing","This is a novel I return to on a regular basis, both for its beauty and its tender wisdom. The portrayal of long friendship ripening into love is quietly and movingly convincing. Sandy's journey from heartbreaking loss to hard-won renewal gains more with every reading; its clear prose, sometimes sharply witty, always lyrical and poignant, is a model of exquisite writing. I had the distinct pleasure of meeting the author several years ago, and it was plain to see the source of this fine novel's emotional depth, insight, and refreshingly sly humor. I only hope that it is reprinted - it is a superb work deserving of rediscovery by a new generation of readers."
5,You dont wanna miss out on this one!,"This book is my fav, and it'll be youre's too if you read it.Its simply the best.And, you'll love it even better if you can relate to it.Such beautiful work can hardly be overlooked.Its so brilliant that ive read it two times,that may not be much, but it is, if your'e trying to memorize the book.This book has also helped get through the tough times ive had.It puts things in prespective.READ IT ! This book has changed me and the life i have ahead of me."
4,Good . . .,". . . and as another reviewer notes, this is the only detailed guide to the area. Ruby Jenkins passed away last year, so this 1994 edition is likely to be the last ever. And there have been changes--for example, the 2000 Manter Meadow wildfire destroyed most of the Domeland Wilderness Area, focus of several trips in the book, so readers are advised to avoid Domeland hikes.I have found that members of the Kern River Valley Hiking Club, a group founded by Ruby Jenkins and accessible on a certain website, regularly take trips described in the book and respond to questions about current conditions, obscure directions and the like with good humor."
1,Junk!,"Can't transfer video signal.If you attempt to play video on TV from your ipod, don't bother. You couldn't see a thing.Mine went to garbage can."
3,This video is about fishing,You should be aware that this video explains how to catch fish and has nothing to do with presentations (except for fish).
1,Beware,I got this for my Toyota and it just didn't work. The dealer told me some non-OEM parts just won't work. Had to return it.
4,Good Flow of tracks for the Rage listener!,"This cd may not be packed with songs but for a single packs a good punch. Killing in the Name and the two b-sides,also on Live and Rare, flow soo nicely with each other. So if your in the mood for some rage just through this disc in and take on the hard hitting Killing in... the exotic guitar of Clear the lane and finish with one of rages strongest songs...Darkness. All ""real"" rage fans should have this one, or not...whatever."
4,Run for (the) cover!,"You know the album, but don't youthink you could do with a cool portrait of Ernesto 'Che' Guevarra in your CD collection?"
5,"Leery, but satisfied.","When I picked up this book my thought's were ""Mystery? Detective's? No. I don't think so."" I said that 3 years ago, and now I've read every vampire related novel in the library so I sighed and picked it up, desperate for something to read. When I got it home and started I was still leery, but soon I was hooked. Now I've read 5 of the series(all that our Library has) and I want to know if there's more. They're excellent and keep you on your toes trying to solve the mysteries that come up in every novel. My favorite character is Charles. He's so suave, and smart. (another plus is the accent.) All in all, excellent plot lines that enthralls readers, well built characters, even the secondary one's, and always interesting twists. And of course, the best part. The Vampires. So, I give this series 5 stars and 3 thumbs up.(I'll just have to borrow someone else's hand)"
3,Enjoyable,"I'm not one for mysteries, but this was okay. A nice change of pace for a vampire book. I'm planning on continuing to read this series."
3,Somewhat satirical vampire coming-of-age escapist fun,A newly made vampire dedicates his time to discovering his lost past while coming to terms with his new future.
5,Supernatural Mystery,"Good book, I've read it more than once. I can't really say much for the books that follow this one, save ART IN THE BLOOD, DARK SLEEP, LADY CRYMSYN and COLD STREETS. In the rest Jack's pretty much running from difrent forms of the mob. They're not bad or anything, I still like them, but if you read them you may want to have them all on hand. Because one goes RIGHT into the next.Ghost Wolf"
4,The Sims2 Nightlife,"The Sims 2: Nightlife Expansion PackI've been playing the sims for a long time and I'd say that this is one of the necessary expansion packs. It brings great amentities to your sims such as cars and being able to go to the ""downtown"" scene. I'd give this game two thumbs up."
5,Must Have Expansion,"If you have to pick only one expansion for Sims 2 to get, this would be it. Nightlife greatly expands your sims' social interaction and the addition of the downtown neighborhood opens the game up to even more possibilities. Vampirism is a fun addition to the game that offers a very unique way of playing your affected sims. Overall, this expansion lets your sims roam away from the confine of their house and explore restaurants, bowling alley, nightclubs, etc., opening up new worlds to them."
4,Can your Mac handle it???,The Sims2 takes a great computer game (the sims) and makes it even better by adding awesome graphics and Nightlife adds even more things to do with your sims...Unfortunately my brand new intel MacBookPro doesn't seem to be able to handle the game even though it meets the system requirments. The game regularly crashes after a certain length of gameplay (deleting all of the new progress I had made) even after I set the options to lowest detail and made sure no other programs were running. (Maybe I should buy the PC versions and see if the game runs better on that half of my MacBook!)
4,Hells Bells & Ding Dong!!,"Strange pairing and no frills, but two great movies at a rock bottom price. No HD or even multi-channel audio unfortunately, but picture quality passable. Houdini is pan and scan.Would love to see Jalopies with it's own special release as it has be Terry-Thomas at his finest, an utter cad!"
5,"""Houdini""","I bought this blu-ray for ""Houdini"" and ""Daring Young Men"" was in the package. I haven't viewed it, but ""Houdini"" is a wonderful movie. I wish that it was a little more accurate in representing the life of this great American escape artist and magician, but it had all the high production values of a George Pal movie."
3,Quality Disappearing Act,"For my age group (55), these two titles are remembered with the perspective of their initial release to television. The aspect ratio was the same, 4:3, and I had hoped to see a 16:9 cinema release. This Blu-ray transfer seems to have nothing new, infact the color registration on some scenes is disappointing. It looks like a unprocessed film transfer with no real attempt to get that edge Blu-ray HD can deliver. I still enjoy the story and the the story telling from an era where special effects were not the focus. The scenes with Tony Curtis swimming under the ice, looking for breathable air gaps, still leaves you tense and anxious. The outfits on Janet Leigh's slender figure are memorable and just a breathtaking.In my opinion, not worth the Blu-ray cut. DVD would have done fine for the effort put into this release. Hopefully a future enhanced HD Blu-ray release is coming and will do justice to the original theater release."
5,"Favourite Sunday School, Resource","Stories divided into manageable lesson length. Gorgeous, realistic, historically faithful illustrations. Print large enough for older children to read along. Pictures captivating for younger children. Excellent adaptation of biblical text for children's understanding, witnessing to a compassionate, steadfast, and loving God, with a balanced and reasoned sensibility.I have taught Sunday school and other religious programming for decades, and have studied Biblical criticism. This is by far my favourite resource. A frequent choice for any church school gifts, and always a pleaser for families."
3,A fun mix,"Sad to see how the swing craze has died off, it produced some really great stuff.This album is a nice mix of several more obscure swing bands, and the songs are a good range of styles and material. If you enjoy swing, this CD should be satisfying. I bought it on a whim and have enjoyed it. Some highlights to watch out for: ""Ruby Mae"" by Indigo Swing, where the talented musicians from that now-defunct band create the musical sound of riding the rails on a cross-country train, and ""Tossin' and Turnin'"" by the Cigar Store Indians, a rockabilly romp reminiscent of Brian Setzer when he was still with the Stray Cats.Indigo Swing's stuff is still available too, and is great. Their latter two albums, ""All Aboard"" and ""Red Light!"" are well worth a listen--or several. Enjoy :)"
4,Nice Looking Inexpensive Watch,I have had this watch for about 1 month. This is a nice looking watch and has some weight to it. Have not tested this watch to see if it is water proof. It seems to be keeping good time so far.
2,Really disappointed,"So I got this watch and loved it (though it is sorta tiny). I work in a veterinary hospital and this was purchased due to the scratch resistance and waterproof. Looks cute and I like the colours a lot. HOWEVER; though the glass is scratch resistant the PLASTIC beveled date cover is not. This small part sits about 1 - 1.5cm on top of the watch face and EASILY gets scratched. Forget checking the date after that. In addition since we just finished Feb, I had to manually adjust the date and when I unscrewed the pin to do so it just slid right out of the watch. This is a pretty watch but if you are considering something durable - this is not the way to go."
2,Cute w/small dial,"I usually purchase a watch/timepiece with a larger dial/face. This one is extremely small. I'll use it for work because my uniform just happens to be Navy w/Red details. Thank goodness the price was great otherwise, it would have been returned."
4,George L's cables,"I've got a love/hate relationship with these cables, in that they work really nicely, but they have a tendency to malfunction if they get moved around at all. I wired them into my GigRig on a PT Pro, but have had them not work at the worst moment: during a gig. I've just got into the habit of checking all the cables before each show, but that seems like something you shouldn't have to worry about all the time.They are great, in that you can custom make your lengths so your pedal board looks sharp. And sonically, they do a great job too!"
1,this is crap,"Bought this product because a friend recommended it, but despite that the plugs are good quality cables apparently not, since I'm using these types of cables have had many problems apparently sound cables are very delicate and tend to break and the guitar does not sound or loose gain pedals sound, apparently goes only part of the signal.Is a product that does not work well I went back and buy cables and rubber lining gets out as if stay loose cable. and I still have problems with the sound and when this happens I have to identify which is the cable having trouble removing them and testing them one by one until you find one that is bad. I would not recommend this product to Satan."
4,Pretty awesome.,The kit sounds great in my car and delivers a noticeable increase in power for my xterra. The kit took a while to put together and the instructions weren't that clear but I figured it out and now my xterra sounds great. It also add a nice low rumble to my engine.
3,Not as good as previous editions,"This dvd is not as exciting as some of its previous editions but is still satifying. Thanks to PBS for retrieving this ""treasures"" so fans can enjoy these performances. I enjoyed the contemporary clips from Charlie Brown, Ragtime, Saigon, and Into the Woods. And I even liked the rare Ethel Merman and Angela Lansbury clips. I was however disapointed by the ""bonus"" features Too Many Girls and Happy Time. In my opinon they were not eleven o clock numbers. In future editions it would be great to see Jennifer Holidays And Im Telling You from Dreamgirls or something from SideShow. It would also be great to see clips from Chorus Line, Company, Follies or anything else from 70's and 80's. I think its great these dvds are coming out but the numbers need to be more showstoppers. This includes the bonus features. Buy this to complete your collection but look forward to better material in the future."
3,"OK, When are we getting to the really special stuff???","Yes, there have been some wonderful moments in the ""Treasures"" series, and all of them are appreciated, but where are the most obvious choices? Are we just being teased? Where's Jennifer Holiday in Dreamgirls, Dorothy Loudon doing ""Vodka"", even Glenn Close's ""With one Look"" along with so many other brilliant performances, even the short dramatic ones - who can forget Maggie Smith's turn in Lettuce and Lovich? With so many brilliant choices, let's lose the more pedestrian choices going forward and really go for broke with the next (Lord willing) one. By the way, wouldn't it be incredible to find a film of Merman performing ""Rose's Turn"" - What a Loss!"
2,Fire the editor !!,"I was so anxious to own this third instalment of this great series, however the editing of this new editon is completely botched.....It gives this edition a cheap , bootleg quality....``My new philosophy`` is spoiled at the end, `The American dream`` starts off three bars into the number, and for most of the numbers, the audience response ( applause) is abruptly interupted...poor jerry orbach, his number ends in a horrible freeze frame...This said , I still will the first person lining up to purchase the next installments..."
4,"Great, but not enough","I enjoyed this DVD. Ragtime is the best. I adored ""Where You Are"", ""Into The Woods Medly"", ""42nd Street"", and ""My New Philosiphy""! I disliked ""Caladonia"" alot. Some parts were slow. But I LOVE this DVD. Can't wait till #4"
2,Ok.. but the other two volumes were way better,"I have to agree with those who are disappointed with this 3rd volume. Highlights for me were ""Ragtime"", and ""How Now, Dow Jones?"" My favourite item in the 3 volumes would have to be ""Let's take a glass"" from DVD 2. I love the Original Cast CD of ""Grand Hotel"", but never saw it on stage, so seeing this number alone was worth the all the bad items on the discs.Let's hope they continue to show truly great performances from both old shows and new. I look forward to reliving the amazing Tommy Tune choreography from ""Will Rogers Follies"" that hopefully will be seen in a future collection."
4,"Please deliver me from lip-synched ""live"" theatre","The ""Broadway's Lost Treasures"" series is such a wonderful idea and the Tony Award telecast has offered a treasure chest of legendary performances over the decades. Why then do the producers tap into the unrelated Broadway t.v. special that was pretty much lip-synched and way too forced in delivery? More than half of this DVD is very, very good though. The scenes from ""Ragtime' and ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" are worth the price of the video. At the other end of the spectrum Angela Lansbury is just embarrassing. And I LOVE Angela Lansbury!Of the four DVD's in this series; it's the second one that I think is best (""Coco"", ""Grand Hotel"", and ""Nine"" are stunning clips). As someone else pointed out ANY record of live theatre preserved is a step in the right direction and I applaude this series for those ""live"" moments. Please lose the lip-synch and release volumes four, five, six, seven, eight...."
4,Perfect,Very satisfied with the product and seller. The book is an excellent source of information about the Dutch political system.
1,Scraping the barrel,"As a lover of both Eric Dolphy, and Herbie Hancock, I was thrilled to hear of this CD that had them together. Unfortunately, the recording quality and performance of this particular concert is so remarkably poor that I found listening to it a complete waste of time. It seems the label was scraping the bottom of the barrel to find something to release that would make them some money. If you love these guys, don't bother with this particular recording. Check out Herbie Hancock's ""Inventions and Dimensions"" from the same time period, and ANY Dolphy has to be better than this!"
4,Good tune,This is the only song I like by The Corrs along with Summer Sunshine. The violins are really good in the background.
2,"Too, Too","This multi purpose pillow is way too soft for my liking.When I rest my knee on it, it totally goes flat. There is no controlor support from it.When I place my head on the pillow, same thing. No support for my head.It might be multi position, but it lacks in the multi support department."
5,"Iron ""not so"" Giant","I picked up this toy at Blockbuster when VHS was still around. The toy was put in shrink wrap right on top of the box. I kept going back looking for one because everybody just used their keys and pretty much stole every one.It's a really cute little toy, not much to it. Articulated at the shoulders and legs, good likeness also. Fans of the Iron Giant will probably want to pick this up instead of one of the very expensive and rare Warner Bros. line. Hard to believe a simple promo for the video is going for $25+! I've had him for years in my toy case and still enjoy him."
3,great collector s toy,"I found the toy b cuz my nefew likes the movie, i was loking for a biger one but unfortunatly i dont found it..this was the only option ...when i get it after fast delivery ;i saw it was to tinny , my nef has 3 years old and well for him was ok... the giant has great details !! even the rivets on the body, the eyes... even the bump in the head !! just like the movie!! he likes the mobil parts...in general its a great toy...but like i said before is better have a bigger one! still looking for IT.!! tks to this I have a great memories of my youth.. and is a way to remember those times!"
1,disappointed,"Because of what the charge was for shipping, I expected this ""Collector's Action Figure to be made of metal, though I have to admit, that the product description didn't say so. To my surprise it is made out of plastic, and I was charged almost $7.00 for shipping and handling, and I'm sure the actual cost of shipping was not more than a dollar or two at the most. And handling, well the figure came in a plastic bag, and in bubble wrap, in one of those post office boxes. That's a lot of 'shipping and handling' for a 4"" plastic figure with arms that move only at the shoulders, and legs that move only at the hip. The arms and legs weren't jointed. So much for the term 'action figure'. Oh, the head swivels. I order a lot from Amazon.com, and this is only the second time I've been disappointed."
3,Unoficial Near Disaster!,"Few nonofficial releases are worth purchasing. This is one of those things you buy, hoping by some chance it'll be wanted in the future. This audio bio, with radio interviews is poor quality. It is assumed this brit is asking them questions, no such luck. It also comes with a book to follow along. It fell apart within two weeks, with little contact. There are some nice picture, though one could easily find then in those teen magazine. Those publication are much cheaper, than this set.The woman who wrote, and red the biography could've done their homework better."
3,Survey says: ehhhh....,"The CD: bits and pieces of about 3 different interviews w/the guys (all old interviews) interlaced between a tired narration of the guys ""success story"" done by a woman with a really thick British accent (it's so funny to hear how she mispronounces JC, Lance, and Joey's last names...i'm so obsessed with 'NSYNC I find myself yelling at the CD: ""It's pronounced ""Shah-zeyh""- NOT CHAY-sez, you FREAK!"" haha) You'll have to sit thought those bio's for each guy that you've heard a thousand times before...but the interviews are cute. (Chris sure knows how to mess with the interwiewers heads!) And the picture book that comes with it has a bunch of old pictures that we've all seen before, but it's cool because it fits in the double case with the interwiew cd; it's a nice lil' item for people who collect everything 'NSYNC (some of the interwiews might be repeats though if you already own an interwiew cd!)"
2,I think this is a joke!,"I bought this CD, with the thought that it would have songs like the European ones like Together Again and Thinking of You and stuff..well, I was wrong. All it was, was an interview with them..lots of them! Personally..I sent mine back..so..I am getting another CD, with MUSIC this time!"
2,This was a big disappointment,"Ok, I got this because I love *NSync, but it just turned out to be a giant dud. The sound quality on the cd is horrible. I would not recommend wasting your money on this. Spend it on some other *NSync memoribilia."
1,all stuck together,"didn't get a chance to use this product. upon opening the bottle, my excitement just went from 10 to zero as I discovered that all the pills are stuck together. you can't even try to peel from each other as the coating will just tear off. very disappointed, should have listened to previous review that this actually happen to this product. I returned it the same day I received it. I would think twice before purchasing."
1,pills stuck together,"I'm not sure if it works or not, but the pills are all stuck together in a disgusting mass, and pulling them apart causes the capsules to break. Fail."
1,Pills stuck together. completely useless,"I couldnt' use a single pill. I got my money back anyway, but there should be something wrong with this many complaints"
1,this stuff did nothing,i didnt notice increased energy in the gymno strength gainsit was a waste of money i used it for 6 weeks....kre-alkyln creatine is better but a tad more expensive
4,A Hard Truth,"If the First Gulf War validated the Vietnam War, then the events of 9/11 and the Iraq War made the First Gulf War a real event. It was a real war with real casualties. This book tells the story of a nurse who deployed with the 312th Evacuation Hospital to Saudi Arabia on the border of Kuwait and Iraq. No infrastructure was there. Just the sand. The hospital treated over 12,000 patients, U. S. and British troops and hundreds of Iraqi prioners plus civilians severely injured. This was over the course of three months in tents erected in the middle of the Saudi Desert. Was the First Gulf War a dry run for the Iraq War? It doesn't matter. It was real and this book is the real story including how the Reserve forces actually work! It's not necessarily a pretty picture, but then when is war pretty? Some graphic descriptions."
1,which 312th evac,"i, too, served in the 312th evac hospital during the persian gulf war. not sure ms. figueroa was even there based on the content of her book. i just hope none of her former co-reservists in the 345th csh recognize themselves in her very harsh comments. it does not appear that the author took into consideration that some of the people mentioned (nameless of course) may have changed over the last 12 to 13 years. she should have kept her writing just to the facts, excluding hearsay, which may at over a decade later result in some serious character assassinations. regardless, the content of the book is questionable, since as i said, having been there as well, am not sure ms. figueroa got all her facts straight, especially her numbers of patients treated. the book would, however, do well in the category of ""historical fiction."""
5,THE BEST SONG TAKEN FROM ROL,Sky Fits Heaven(Victor Calderone Remix Edit) is fantastic! You're gonna love it!
5,Better than pt.1!!!!!,"Just like the Ray Of Light single (pt.2) this is better than pt.1!!!!! Pt.2 always seems to be better. Comments:01 Substitute For Love (5.08) Great song02 Sky Fits Heaven (Sasha Remix 7.21) Great remix03 Sky Fits Heaven (Victor Calderone Remix 5.48) Really stunning, excellent mix. Better than most of his mixes!!!!!BUY IT!!!!! As well as PT. 1!!!!!"
1,Disappointing Performance,"Stop. Don't waste your money. Amazon will not let you return it, even if it's still new. The Socket CHS-7M is far better. The laser makes a big difference for read rate. This model uses a cheap imager and cannot read very well at all."
1,One Star,"One StarIt's fun to watch a bad magician drop his rabbits. The excellent reviews after this one observe how Mr Aczel's ""proof"" rests on an assumption that pops out clumsily on the third-last page. I'll just throw two additional tomatoes at the performance. One: the key sentence in the quotation on page 1 seems to be an invention, I have the text (Epicurus's letter to Herodotus) in front of me and do not see any mention of life on other worlds. Two: the Inspection Paradox (also known as the Bus Paradox) says some interesting things about average wait times for buses, but it does not imply that on a roulette wheel with 8 ""red"" and 4 ""black"" and 4 ""green"" our chances of hitting ""red"" are greater than 50%."
1,This poorly written book is full of inaccuracies.,"The book reads like a set of author's notes upon which to base a book rather than a finished book. There seems to have been virtually no editing. There are several places in which the author's use of English is questionable (""Jupiter moves in a nearly spherical orbit around the sun..."".40; ""For even if we find planets...where temperatures may be ambient...""p.122-3), and the book engages in quite annoying and uninformative bouts of name-dropping. Further, the book is prone to lengthy digressions, and the central argument is confined to the final 50 pages. The final argument itself is so tendentious and misleading that it cannot be taken seriously as it stands, although I have little doubt the conclusion it argues for is likely. In short, a jumbled mess of a book with more misinformation than information."
3,Kick it down a notch or two,"I loved thier 1st CD. It was lively , fun and is a top 10 fav. This album is well made and thier playing is excellent. However it does not have the energy, power and passion of thier 1st recording. Perhaps this is a mellow one for them, it is nice..but I miss the energy so strong in thier first CD. I highly recommend thier 1st recording over this one. I guess I will have to wait for thier 3rd to see where they're going.. I hope it heads back to the life and fun so evident in their 1st CD."
5,Can't help but dance around the house to this disc.,"After hearing Gaelic Storm in Titanic, I bought their first album which was wonderful. It is like bringing the pub to your house, but without the Guinness :( So when I heard that GS was releasing another album I hurried to get it. I think it is much better. While still having a traditional sound, energy, and beat, they have made the songs sound new. If you are a fan of Irish folk, this is a must buy!"
1,Bweh! :(,"What a disappointment this CD was! After their spectacular first CD (easily one of the best Irish CDs I've heard recently), I was gearing up for more of the same... imagine my surprise. It was like expecting a bonfire and getting a candle instead. Gone is the inventiveness, fun, and verve of their first album; instead there's a series of vapid tune sets and gimmicky songs. There is nothing new on this CD, nothing that they didn't do better on their first CD. Do yourself a favour and get Gaelic Storm's debut CD instead."
5,I don't know what the bad reviews are about...,"I've owned 2 different versions of Creatacard software. I believe my first was the original and now I own version 5 Platinum. I'm currently just shopping for an upgrade because I LOVE THIS SOFTWARE!! I've never had a bug or a hitch, except once when my computer had a virus. I think the other reviewer should look into that possibility! This is fantastic because you can import your own artwork, photos, etc. It has an adequate photo editing program -- good enough to create custom envelopes by clipping images, etc., from the artwork being used. My only beef with it is that it isn't possible to do any sophisticated photo editing, like object removal.I've tried a couple of other printshops out there for greeting cards, and this is definitely the easiest, most straight-forward one I've found. I'm just ready for an upgrade :)"
2,TOO DIFFICULT,"I ORDERED THIS VIDEO THINKING I WOULD GET ONE LIKE MY COMPUTER REPAIR PLACE LOST.HOWEVER, I COULD NEVER MESH THIS WITH MY PRINTER SO IT WAS NOT SATISFACTORY AT ALL.I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT, BUT AT 76 YEARS OF AGE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT AS IT WASAN AMAZON SELLER AND NOT AMAZON. THIS VIDEO WAS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE AMERICAN GREETINGS THAT I HAD USED FOR 7 YEARS. I WORKED OVER 2 HOURS WITH IT AND ATTEMPTED TO DO SO SEVERAL TIMES TO NO AVAIL.MOLLY BRITT"
4,Average Watch,"I was a little surprised at the size and weight of this watch, its almost 0.5in thick, and the bezel is a full 1.5in across so the case is a bit bigger than that. The mineral glass crystal seems substantial and durable, but the clarity is just average. In addition to having glow-in-the-dark markings (which don't work too well) on the hands and dial-markers, it also has an Indiglo style back-light (which does work well). The bezel only rotates counter-clockwise, and it seems very tight at first. Overall, it's a decent everyday watch."
3,Not too great.,This is not what I expected. It has a gold sparkle-ness to it that I didn't expect and do not want. It's not warm and is slightly itchy. It doesn't look that great on either. Not worth the $20 I paid for it.
4,Also got a bad module,"Although I wouldn't be quite as harsh as another reviewer, I do have to register my surprise that of the 2 modules I received one of them was defective. Of course Amazon was great about getting me a replacement at no extra cost. But one would think that PNY would have better quality control. The only downside was that I had to pull my computer out (dealing with the tangle of wires) twice in order to put the second module in a few days later."
4,Good Product,The product works wonderful and was delivered timely. The picture is a misrepresentation of the actual product though.
4,Works as expected.,I bought this memory the help my aging PC run better. Easy to drop in and now my old PC is running great. Need to get some more to completely max out my memory requirements.
3,Not as Pictured,The product does not come with heat sinks like in the picture on the product page.Everything else is the same.
4,Great service!,"I couldn't believe how quickly the product arrived, and then when I realized I made a mistake in what I ordered they worked with me to fix it! I would definitely buy from them again!"
2,"Not a low density memory, be carefull","Buyers be carefull with this memory, first ask to the seller if it is compatible with your pc.The memory i received does not have heat spreader like the picture in the listing, if you see the pictures about this memory in the amazon site it seems to have heat spreader, Seller should remove this picture because buyers buy what they see. i think this is dishonest.Another problem was that, it did not work in my msi motherboard, the memory is not fully compatible with all motherboards.The only reason that i did not request a refund or return the memory was that it worked fine in a pc at 667mhz clock.I hope this helps you."
3,One bad stick That PNY corrected right away for me.,I would of gave a better star but one of the 2 sticks of ram was bad. When I e-mailed PNY they allowed me to only send them one of the 2 sticks back to them for replacement. Otherwise it would of been 5 Stars. I would buy there ram again anytime. I have used there ram numerous times in the past without problems. Would buy again.
2,not for laptops,gateway referred me to this RAM for my laptop. it is not for laptops! my ignorance is my frustration. worked fine replacing my 256 RAM in my homemade desktop.
3,Not as pictured,"The package, photos, and exact product shown on Amazon.com are not the same as the product shipped. The photos and advertising clearly show heat diffusers on the modules. They arrived as plain unprotected modules, same product number. Otherwise, they seem to be working fine. I actually called Amazon prior to ordering, because I saw the unprotected modules in a retail store ($52.99 plus tax), same product number, and was confused. Also, same comment as mine from other Amazon reviews. I was assured by Amazon that if there was a discrepancy in the past, it would have been corrected by now. It turns out that is not the case."
3,Ok but missing parts,"In the pic. you will notice that the ram has heat sinks right.... DON'T BELEVE WHAT YOU SEE!!! They are standard factory RAM ie. ""no heat sinks"". The RAM works fine for the application I needed but the pic. of them on here is deceiving. Where I come from that's called fails advertising."
3,Same defective problem...,"Like another reviewer I also had a problem with one of the sticks. They both worked fine for about 3 weeks, and then suddenly ""poof"" one of them gives up the ghost. Not exactly sure why....PNY has a lifetime guarantee and I am really impressed with the classy operation they are running. I am awaiting my new stick.The product is AWESOME however. Pretty responsive to overclocking and a pretty decent price. I do however feel I should have gone with Kingston..."
3,can't tell much of a difference,"after installing these modules, I come to find out that Win XP will only register 3GB of RAM, which I already had. SO I haven't been able to notice much difference. It's a little unfair for me to review PNY if I have other hardware limitations."
1,AMAZON'S GREAT. THIS RAM'S NOT.,"I love amazon and buy a ton of stuff from them. They really are one of the best e-tailers out there, period.THIS PNY RAM IS GARBAGE. I'VE BOUGHT 7 SETS OF STICKS OF WHICH 3 SETS WERE DEFECTIVE. AND SOME OF IT DOESN'T REAR ITS HEAD FOR A FEW DAYS IN, BUT THEM THE MEMORY ERRORS AND CRASHES BEGIN. I HAD REPLACEMENT SETS SENT FROM AMAZON(WHO WERE GREAT ABOUT EXCHANGING OF COURSE) THAT WAS ALSO DEFECTIVE. Different computers installed on, doesn't matter. The stuff is really just junk. Pay the extra for another brand."
1,DDR2 PNY purchase,"The item was said to be a 200 pin ram that would fit in an inspiron 1501, but it was actually a 240 pin ram. I had to order a seperate product because this item was not returnable after 15 days. This was a christmas gift that was unopened until after the 15 days had past."
3,May not fit PC2-3200 memory slot,"I have an older e-machine that needed a memory boost. it uses pc2-3200 ram. i purchased this pc2-4200 module because it was a better price and in the description was also claimed to be compatible with pc2-3200 systems. while it is the same dimension as the existing pc2-3200 module, the notch placement is slightly different and would not fit into the e-machine. so i returned it. as always, amazon made the process painless. i bought the more expensive pny pc2-3200 modulePNY OPTIMA 2GB (2x1GB) Dual Channel Kit DDR 400 MHz PC3200 Desktop DIMM Memory Modules MD2048KD1-400, which fit perfectly. i'm writing this review for others who may be thinking the same thing, ""pc2-3200 compatible, better price, why not?"""
5,delicious recipes!!,The recipes in this book really work!! I have tried few and they are delicious. I have tried other Cuban cooking books and have been disappointed by the dishes. It seems like some cookbook writers are not thinking that readers are actually going to try the recipes. That is not the case of this book. Chef Garcia's recipes are outstanding!
1,Leave it on the Shelf,"Yes, here are a lot of good recipes in a book. The book quality, also OK. However, never mind how that, the author, Alex Garcia, was indicted by US government on drug trafficking charges! (Check the NY Times November 2003.) Is that the kind of author that you want to send your money to? Yes, all are innocent until proven guilty - but he was under surveillance for 2 years - NOT a nice guy! In my country we keep people like him in jail! There are much better Cuban cookbooks - just search for ""Cuban Cooking book"" here on Amazon!"
3,Os Mutantes - 'A Divina Comedia Ou Ando.....' (Omplatten),"Originally released in 1970, 'A Divina...' was their third effort. Only thing I can honestly about Os Mutantes (aka The Mutants) is that they were a halfway decent Brazilian obscure psych band. Nothing all that great here, you understand. But okay. Their first three CD reissues are supposed to be their best. Line-up: Rita Lee - vocals, Sergio Baptista - guitar and Arnaldo Baptista - drums.Might possibly appeal to some fans of early Beatles, Spectrum, Love and MPB-4. Take a chance here. You might get more out of it than I did."
3,Yummy,"This is really a great product, smells good and keeps your skin very moisturized. I think this item is ideal for both adults and children."
3,NPG guitarist's Solo LP,"This is the very first solo effort by Kat Dyson of the New Power Generation. Dyson has been around the block as a studio musician and has worked on three ""Artist"" albums and two ""NPG"" albums. Her guitar work is clean and precise. Her style would indicate that there is some classical or jazz training under her belt. Not the greatest vocalist, but gets the job done. Many guest musicians on this album. As a whole not a great effort, but not too shabby. A must buy for NPG fans. Recommended for smooth R&B and jass lovers, otherwise maybe a pass."
2,Not very good,"I bought this CD for the song ""Rocky Top"". It has some non-standard version of Rocky Top that I am not familiar with and do not like as well as the one I normally hear on the radio or anywhere else. I had to wind up downloading the song even though I bought the CD."
5,Best of the Best,"If the music of this album doesn't warm your heart, bring a smile to your face, and get your toes a-tapping, then brother, you're dead. There is no real accurate way to describe the Osborne Brothers, other than to say, they are one-of-a-kind. All of their music, not just those numbers found on this album, could never really be called standard/traditional Bluegrass. The songs chosen for this album are all great, and I couldn't imagine any other selections improving the album. This is one of those discs that will remain in you player. A+"
5,Big bang for the buck,Seagate ST3200822A-RK 200 GB ATA Internal Hard Drive delivers lots of high quality storage at an affordable price.
4,"Good drive, good price",The only gripe I have is that I had to update my version of the Intel Application Accelerator. With the old version the drive just would not format. Seagate support was both helpful and reponsive to all my inquiries.
4,"Great brand, great drive","I bought this drive to use not as a internal drive but external, and I when I put it in the enclosure and it doesn't work for some reason. Then I tried a different enclosure and it's worked. I don't know exactly why it does not work but beside that the drive work great."
2,Quiet it is NOT,"To my dismay, I discovered that this drive does not support acoustic management modes. Everytime the cache is flushed (which is every 2-3 min or so) I have to put up with what sounds like the buzzing of a large insect trapped inside the computer case. It may be acceptable in a server room, not on a desktop. I'm going to return this thing and exchange it for either a Maxtor or a WD."
2,making noise,"I have nothing to complain about the functionality, price, and installation. They are all good. 200 giga bytes hard drive only coasts me $100 after rebate. Installation software works great. And copy files in/out without any problem.But, the harddrive drives me crazy by its noise. It makes this low click-click noise while it accessing the disk, AND when it is idle. When it is idle, about every minute, it makes noise last around 3 seconds. The noise is not loud, but just enough to make me pay attention...."
5,it's just simply GREAT!!,"i loved this hard drive since it works just perfect. when it's working, it's as quiet as off!!But I haven't used it for a long time. Just kept for about one month. so hopfully its great performance lasts."
2,the WWE isnt about cars its about wrestling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game was so horrible all u did was ride around in a dumb car collecting little star things. Once u beat the game, all u get is Vince Mcmahon, waste of my 25 dollars."
1,"THIS GAME [isn't good]! ITS TRUE, ITS TRUE!",I don't know why I bought this game. Maybe because after Smackdown!...I was impressed with THQ's ability to make a wrestling game. This game is Twisted Metal of old Playstation fame with a WWE theme. If you are a fan of Twisted Metal this game will offer nothing new in terms of gameplay. If you are a WWE fan the only thing appealing is looking at the cars modeled after wrestlers - but that appeal wears off soon. Definatley a disappointment.
4,Does the job!,"I take one of these before my workout, and definitely notice an increase in circulation. The effect lasts about 2 to 3 hours, which is plenty of time for my workout.The pill itself is not coated, and is medium-large (not as big as TwinLab's Amino Fuel Mass) so if you're not accustomed to swallowing pretty big chalky supplements, they might be difficult for you.The price is right, too--Amazon is much cheaper than the health food store on these sorts of supplements."
3,Not much of an impact,"I'm not really sure what this did for me. It's supposed to increase blood circulation, but I'm not quite sure how I'd know if it were working. Didn't notice any amazing results, but I wasn't really expecting anything amazing. For weightlifting, I'd suggest sticking with creatine, but if you're interested in the other health benefits, it's probably worth a try (good price and no side effects)."
1,good idea that doesn't work,This is a clever idea that is poorly designed. The pressure pad is too short so that when cars pass over it alternates working and released. Therefore the crossing semiphores bounce up and down continuously like the dunking duck. A complete waste of money.
3,Stellar musicians,"I liked the first two discs by these guys better.There's no denying that this band is totally top shelf, it's just that the songs here seem a little uninspired.The first three tracks: China Cat, Estimated Prophet, and St. Stephen/The Eleven are worth the purchase price. But the next couple drag on: Drums & Jam and Blues for Allah--what a boring song. Terrapin Station and Morning Dew finish it all off, but for my tastes just weren't burning."
2,I am Unwilling to Recommend This to Anyone Else,"This is the story of service station mechanic Munch Mancini who has a daughter named Asia who has never met her cousins. This is because they are on the witness protection program but a phone call from Asia's father's sister Lisa puts this into doubt. After meeting up in a park the next day Charlotte, one of the cousin's goes missing and a frantic Lisa calls Munch for help. Charlotte is on medication and does not have it with her so a reluctant Munch begins the search and calls her ex boyfriend Detective Rico Chacon for help.Although not the worst story ever written it does drag on excessively in parts. The ridiculously stupid names Munch and Asia do get on your nerves after a while as does the farfetched detective abilities of a service station mechanic. There are much better books to accompany you on your reading journey than this."
2,Domestic engineer - no mystery,"There is no plot - just hauling children around. Something all women do even when grandchildren arrive. There is no story, no mystery, no outline, just a hodge-podge mixedup adults. B. Sernella has been one of my favorite authors,; however, no one can leave work whenever an urge hits them Especially, a mechanic cannot with customers always Wanting their car repaired Yesterday. Parts of this read do not have a reference in the story and parts that don""t have any resolve before end of the book. I just got seasick from the vechicles envolved. Please do not buy this book. You can almost live this story everyday of your life. Everyone's family has some characters in it."
5,Great shoes with great looks,I've just bought them today. The shoes really gives you a very balances base. I can tell the difference as soon as i put them on. The friction against the floor is great. The shoes hug my feet very well and feels very comfortable. The look of the shoes is quite nice. They go well with my jeans too if i wanted to wear them to walk around. Awesome volleyball shoes.
3,a great resource for youth groups,I run a youth group in our community center and used WWW.Here-I-AM in a recent series on religion. The book was well-received by the kids (ages 11 through 12) allowing them to really think and begin to form their own opinions about religion and God. It's great for starting discussions and helping the kids learn that they can form their own educated opinions about the world around them. Give it a try! I plan to use it next year as well.
3,Not bad...but my least favorite from them.,"Out of all of their albums, this has to be my least favorite. It has a couple great tracks, but the only one that really stands out is the title track. On albums like A Dead Poem, Triarchy of Lost Lovers, and Genesis, they succeed in being far more epic....whereas on this album is feels very tired and run of the mill.Not a bad album by any means, but I recommend pretty much any of their other albums before this one.Oh...and they are from Greece. Not Germany."
4,Beautiful....however....,"I love this cd, unfortunately, I have been with these guys for a really long time, and this album for me is a little less than what I would have hoped for. The Mighty Contract and Triarchy of lost souls are both extremely epic feeling albums. To a lesser degree, so is A dead Poem, as that particular album just plain rocks, but doesnt give you the feel the formers do. Most people would disagree with me on that, but thats a different review isnt it? I just felt that with Sleep of the angels, Rotting Christ lost their epicness, their passion, and their style. It is still Rotting christ, with many good songs (The title track is the best), but they could have done better......"
3,HAIL TO THE HELLENIC GODS,"I GIVE THIS CD 3 STARS BUT ONLY BECAUSE I LIKE THEIR PAST RECORDINGS BETTER, BUT THIS IS STILL A GOOD RECORDING. IF YOU LIKED THE SLOWER GOTHIC FEEL OF ""A DEAD POEM"", THEN THIS SHOULD PLEASE YOU. ROTTING CHRIST WERE PIONEERS OF THE BLACK METAL GENRE(ALONG WITH MAYHEM). IF MYSTIC BLACKNESS IS WHAT YOU ARE CRAVING, THEN BUY ""THY MIGHTY CONTRACT"" OR ""THE TRIARCHY OF THE LOST LOVERS"""
3,Totally just ok album,"No black no white -> gray. Yes just ok album. I cant understand how can somebody find their lets say black metal album ,,as lovely album. I cant get it guys. Its just an average neutral just ok album with very average tracks. And its not black metal -> it just has black metal vocals..the music is lets say slow metal"
5,True Gothic Metal.,"Out of all the different gothic bands out there Rotting Christ has my vote for the top three best gothic artists of all time. All the way from Germany these five men kick off some lurid but calm and relaxing gothic metal.I first saw the album at my local record store and decided to pick it up and check it out, what a great decision I made. The music is so mellow you think your listening to opera but with death vocals. ""Sleep of the Angels"" is by far Rotting Christ's best album to date. ""Dead Poem"" was good but it didn't come close to this album. And yes everyone to there own opinion.I recommend this album to any gothic fan. And if the name of the band offends you cause it's anti-god or whatever just remember.....don't buy it.

5,The Egyptian,"I remember seeing this movie as a young girl and falling in love with it. I don't know if it was the story that attracted me or the music that haunted me. Eventually able to find the book, the movie, and a cassette of the soundtrack. I listened to the music so much I wore out the tape. When I found this CD I was thrilled. It is a sound you can listen to for a long time and often and still find hidden attractions. One of my best purchases of all time and a jewel of my music collection."
1,Not good.,Bernard Hermann was a brilliant composer for film. Especially for the Hitchcock films he scored. And no small composer in traditional music forms. But The Egyptian score is a flop. Musical cliches typical of a very bad sand and sword epic.
2,what a joke,"This album is not good, trashy trance at its finest. Yeah, Sasha is on here but only in his Xpander form, which is horrendous when used in the wrong context. Oh, and that Mark fellow was ripping off BPM Magazines preview of Sasha's Airdrawndagger."
3,Pretty good but far from the best..............,This cd has few good tracks but overall it is far from the best
2,Seller misrepresented condition of book,"This book had pages that were publication errors and many sections had drastic changes in the point size of the lettering. Ink quality of printing was also poor. Also there were pages that had been folded in all around to fit the book, obviously this is a 'misprint' book. I was very disappointed. But being a book lover I kept it. The content was close to what I was looking for, and as this book represents knowledge of my faith, I will still treasure it for its content. But I will never purchase another book from this seller again. This is not a novel but a prayer book, and a reference book. To misrepresent the condition, and sell it when it is obviously poorly manufactured is sad...both for the book, and what it says about the sellers and publishers."
4,action movie,"i like action movies , and this is very good kirk douglas is great in this movie , and so is j wayne"
4,Good Movie,Another classic John Wayne movie. Kirk Douglas is great in this also. Lots of action and several other great actors.
4,NOT BAD AT ALL... BUT NOT GREAT...,"John Wayne and Kirk Douglas star in this action western as two gunfighting rivals who team up to steal $500,000 in gold... Wayne and Douglas have great chemistry on screen and both a rivialy on and off the screen as well... So, with this, you'd expect an excellent film, but this is not an excellent film.This is a good film, but not great... Wayne and Douglas are great as usual. The film does have action, and comedy like many Wayne films. But ""War Wagon"" has a B-movie feel and it is somewhat a slow pacing film at times. The action is nothing to write home about.This film could have been better, but still a good view at times. Wayne is the best ever and his films are good to view nonetheless. I just wish this one was better..."
4,Filled action western!,"John Wayne is an ex-con who is bent on revenge for being framed and robbed of his gold yielding land. Eventually he will team with up with the two faced mercenary Kirk Douglas to steal the gold shipment being transported in a special armored stage better known as the War Wagon.Plenty of fine irony, laughs and action; although for many Wayne's fans it's far from being the most reminded but as easy entertainment, gets the goal."
4,Above-average western,"This is an above-average western that pairs John Wayne & Kirk Douglas as scheming partners who try to capture a heavily defended gold shipment. It has a witty, funny script, and colorful supporting characters."
3,"good western,middling dvd tranfer","This is really an above average , later year wayne western with an energetic, slightly over the hill kirk douglas hamming it up along the way.He is probably one of reasons to see this film. The tiomkin score is below average but how many westerns could the great maestro score and hit the mark every time.But it is the transfer that merits the grade and it is spotty in sharpness and color contrast and in some places downright flat;good western ,poor transfer(or poor print)univeral classic western edition.Good cast,story,fair script.two pros.3 wheels; your move."
3,Decent enough,"Not our favorite, but better than average. It is not the ""Duke"" being larger than life, but overall, the movie is entertaining. Just don't expect something on the order of Rio Bravo or Eldorado."
3,doesnt hold much,"tthe color is good, the nets are very thin and what i dont like is that the elastic is also very very thin and doesnt hold much, I can not create a tight bun with it."
3,Great 3-D Mouse. Not durable.,"Functionally this 3-D mouse is great. The shortcut keys are assignable to useful functions (iso view, save, undo, etc). The problem I have now is that the mouse has a thin tactile rubber coating that is quickly falling off. Once there's a ""hole in the armor"" so to speak, the whole coating starts peeling away, so it looks like my mouse has eczema."
3,"Nice, but too many buttons.","I tried this, & was initially a bit overwhelmed by all the buttons: there are so many, it's easy to trigger them accidentally when you're tiliting the device head. The '2D' function annoyed me at first, but it can prove useful. The best thing about this uinit is the ""hand-rest""-shaped body, which keeps the unit in correct orientation, (a constant problem with the basic unit.) In the end, I decided the buttons were superfluous; I can just add some keyboard shortcuts in Solidworks instead. I returned it & went back to the more basic PE edition. (I also use double-sided tape to keep it in place on my desk.) It's simpler, & MUCH cheaper."
3,SpaceBall User Review,Product functions well. It would be nice to have more indents on some of the buttons so your fingers don't get lost. One major complaint I have is with the protective rubber coating around joystick. The coating is thin and made of rubber and started coming off whithin a month of use.
4,One neva stop learning bout himself -,"...First and foremost big up to the Michael Dyson. When I first heard of da book over da net. I really wanted to read it right then and there. This book reveals a lot bout Tupac and da influence his mom had on him and as a young South African dis book teaches me a lot about self respect,respect for others,especially women and that each and everyone of us has got a purpose in dis world"
5,Strong Book,only a Great Mind&Soul Like Michael Eric Dyson could Bring together another Powerful&Strong Book.The Genius of Mr.Dyson's Writing&Wording bring Home the Meaning&Vibe that 2Pac was saying in many of His Songs&Poems.Very Much on point.The Interviews were on Point as well.Mr.Dyson Writes like Nobody's Business to me.Very Well Read&Yet Full Of Understanding so that everybody can Relate.
3,"Some interesting insight, but not nearly enough relevant information to fill a book.","Some chapters provided some great insight into the struggle and plight of Black youth which makes some of Tupac's decisions and actions more comprehendable. However, if you've been following Tupac for a while now, read and watched his interviews, you can tell that a significant amount of the speculation on his character and his life are simply off-target.So basically what it boils down to, the way I see it, is a book that gives you some information but not enough about Black youth, and some information but not enough (at least in terms of accuracy) about Tupac. If you want to know more about Tupac, read and watch his interviews, he tells you everything you need to know about himself."
2,title misleading,"The author offers some insight into cultural issues, but for the most part, this is a very disappointing book that doesn't bring you any closer to understanding Tupac or the choices he made. Both the intended audience and the style of this book are very confused as well - it offers too little insight to be a biography, but is too focused on one individual to be cultural criticism; it's too academic in some ways, and too much like a magazine article in others.I also echo previous viewers' issues with the author's vocabulary. It's often uncomfortable (like someone is trying too hard to impress you) or completely confounding, such as comparing Tupac's lyrics to 'the ethical poverty of romantic nationalism'. What in the world does that mean, and what does it have to do with Tupac Shakur?"
5,Tupac is the greatest rapper ever,Anybody who gives any Tupac book a rating under 5 stars can bliznow me. Yeaheeyeah. Gk love
2,too wordy,"I think the author spent more time with his face in his thesaurus then he did researching.why can't writers just WRITE!? why do they always have to spin webs of diction and prose, JUST WRITE so we can JUST READ."
4,The Other Side of Tupac,I decided to read this book after seeing Michael Eric Dyson on BET Tonight w/ Suge Knight and had to see what this book was all about. I guess Suge's igonrance and Dyson's comments were what made me have to go out and buy this book. Suge accused Dyson of writing the book to simply make money and that he did not know Tupac well enough to write a book about his life. Dyson's response was that he wrote the book so that other could see the Tupac and that only close friends knew and to say that this book should be read in public schools. No Dyson may not have known Tupac personally but the people he talked to for this book did and there is so much more to Tupac that what the media portrayed or how they portrayed him I should say. There is so much more meaning behind the words he wrote and rapped about. Tupac really did not recieve all the credit he was due.I hope that Suge read the book althought I am sure he will still won't be able to understand what Dyson is trying to say.
5,Great hat for the money,THIS IS A GREAT HAT FOR THE MONEY. It is a little misleading on the size. I thought it was for a grown up but its really sized for little kids.
3,"classic songs, but there's better bargains (in the US)","This has an extremely strong song selection, but as cool as the song selection is, & though it features a hefty 25 tracks, this clearly ain't much a value at all for US shoppers at the current price. I mean, heck--there's the Rhino reissues of the actual albums, box sets, a pile of other compilations... If you're a newer fan & somehow see this cheap, it may be the best single disc Monkee compilation around, but otherwise you can get a lot more for your money."
5,Sword and Sorcery cartoon of an epic conquest.,"Sword and Sorcery cartoon of an epic conquest. The true story of Liu Pei, the father of historical China, Great Conquest is a spectacular animated motion picture filled with breathtaking action and captivating intrigue. Set in what was to become Imperial China, circa 169 a.d., the story follows the key characters who would come together to forge a brave new nation out of the flames of chaos and the unrelenting suffering of the oppressed. Narrated by Pat Morita."
4,Great gift for grads going on...,"Very cute, easy to read book for those who plan to persue their PhD. It is the perfect gift for those entering a graduate level program."
5,best RTS ever??,"STARCRAFT and TOTAL ANNIHILATION = two best RTS. TA was RTS of the year in 1998 (i think) and starcraft is probably the most popular rts of the past 5 years. These two are far more addictive and offer a lot more than aoe, ra and warcraft."
5,"Excellent Game, prompt shipping","I've been a longtime fan of starcraft ever since it came out... which I'm sad to say is becoming a quite large body of time. The product was great, except that the cd-key I was provided with the software was muted on battle.net. I'd never even seen that before. I'm having to spend a great ammount of time correcting that, but otherwise, delicious!"
2,Not As Good As It Gets,"Starcraft was one game I was looking forward to buying because I am such a big fan of strategy games, but i must say it is not the best. This game is rediculously futuristic. This game is a great idea with all the species and missions, but all the units and building structures are too futuristic to make a good game out of the storyline it has. The only reason it got two stars from me is because it is a blast to play online with friends or even just joining into a game with people you don't know. The whole online thing is very nicely set up and it is fun to play. If want it for that reason, get it. Other than than that get a real strategy game."
3,A good work...,"Lets face it, starcraft is a revamp or rehash of warcraft I&II. Here are the Cons: 1. not exactly the best graphics...even for the time it came out. 2. same basic concept and way you play single player missions as W.C. I&II. 3. blizzard didn't exactly do the best job they could with making an engine. 4. blizzard games, by nature, are very addicting and this is definately no except. Pro: 1. simplistic-doesn't have many units, yet tons of strategies... 2. Fun...why the hell else would we play games? 3. multiplayer has tons of features...some of which i haven't used...and i've had it since 1997! Bottom Line: buy it if you like strategy games/warcraft II...but don't buy it for the graphics...trust me."
1,A discrace to strategy games!,"I just can't figure out where these people get it! Everywhere I go I hear, and I quote, ""This is the best game, nothing beats it!"". Well, sorry guys, but for me, nearly, no not even that, everything, beats it. All this game is is a cartoony and futurisic Age of Empires II. The graphis are horrible, the plot is stupid (at least Age II had some historical accuracy), and is a complete waste of computer space, money, and time. I, personally would never even consider buying this game, but if you really like it, be brave, go ahead, but I wouldn't recommend it; save your computer the grief, and use your money on a more practical game. If I could have given it no stars, I might have considered it, but my one star goes to the game's cinematics and ""movies"", which I, to much embarassment, admit are pretty darn good."
5,"VERY good game, especially if you do everything","I am a huge fan of stradegy games. However a lot of stradegy games loose there fun after a while because you have mastered it and nothing changes. This game is different. In addition to regular gameplay and missions you can play online for against other people play. There is also games called map settings games. this is why it never gets boring. People are always making map settings games that have nothing to do with the accual starcraft game. Anything from SCV football to snipers, these can all be made and played online againsed other players, and since new and different maps are being made all the time, it never gets boring. Definetly a good game for any gaming fan."
1,Command and Conquer is better,"Starcraft is one of the most annoying games ive ever played. Sure, terran marines give u a little laugh now and then but the controls are frustrating. You have to right click(why not the usual left-click?) to select units and you cant deselect them. Building times are extremely long- and so are the units. Gameplay on my PC is overall boring and slow( on a Pentium II 400, voodoo3, 96mb RAM). I have only got up to the third terran mission then finally gave up. And whats up by only controlling 12 units at a time? The Command Conquer series lets you control all units you have on screen.Starcraft's ingame graphics aren't that good, FMV qualty is terrible and Battle.net gives you a pain in the a** because of its slow server and few options. Westwood online gives the player more options and is also faster. All in all, i say the command and conquer series is better - go play tiberian sun or red alert or any other C&C game - SC isnt worth your time or money."
1,Very disapointing,"{YAWN} Very boring disapointing game. Terrible gameplay, graphics, bla bla bla. The cinematics run at an extremely slow frame rate. At least the music is kinda good. I don't recommend this for any god damn gamer. =[..."
5,best game I played In years,It has sweet graphics and cool species of different things such as the zerg race they are my favorite race
5,it is great,"When I first played this game, it was frustrating, but in a fun way: HOW CAN I DEFEAT THEM WHAT WILL THEY DO NEXT, kind of like a mind game or something. After u get the hang of it, its all fun! If MISSION OBJECTIVES arnt ur thing, then they have COSTOM GAME section, so u only need to destroy all the buildings. great game a mustHAVE for u ""BIRDS EYE VIEW"" kind of players."
5,Wow,"This is a great game. It could do just fine with the strategy of ""Melee"" or ""Top Vs Bottom"" (settings in the game), but with the addition of ""Use Map Settings"" (another setting of the game)where you can play campaigns, survival games, all made by players such as yourself (yes, it comes with a ""Campaign Editor"" to make your own map), this game is years of fun. I give it 5 stars!"
5,Absolutely Great,"Starcraft is one, if not the coolest, game I ever played. It is so fun; anyone that does not have this game absolutely needs to buy it right away. Believe me, when I bought this, I got a ton more than I thought I would get. YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME!"
3,Good Or Bad,This game is VERY fun!! The down fall is that people are hacking so be careful playing! Do not use cheats it makes the game less fun!!! The price is right buy it !!!! Brood War adds many more men to the game. One New thing is that Hurt men can be healed!! Both games are cheap and fun. The best part is playing on the internet!! Buy This Game!!
1,Suprisingly Yawnish,"Yes, 1 star. While there are some very commendable traits, such as the hugely varying species, and an OK upgrade system, I did not like this game at all. It was really boring. The plot was real good but it was the combat that drove this game right into the ground. How often can you find two guys in helicopters, hovering 12 feet apart exchanging fire. Units do not evade in combat, they do not really do anything exciting (with exception of a few units). I would recomend you borrow this game from a friend before touching it."
5,another cool Blizzard game!,"A long time ago, I heard of a great game called Starcraft. Just recently, I played it at a friend's house and loved it so much I had to go out and buy it. Starcraft has excellent sound variety and alright graphics, but what stunned me the most was the strategy involved in building and defending your colony, and eventually destroying the enemy. Loved the battlenet!"
5,The Best Game Around,"I'm a teenager, and I love this game. I have tons of game, but the one I play the most is Starcraft. It has awesome weapons, cool scenarios, and the best graphics around."
2,best game ever,Star craft is amazing with lots of things extra to do to keep you hooked. Like the map editor where you can make just as good maps as the game. or the teo expansion sets witch I've got. Brood wars gives you new players too. Then being able to down load maps off the internet. Finaly you've got battle net that lets you play online. No game can compare to starcamericaraft
5,One of the best!,The story is incredible.The sound is good.Funfactor is very good.All the 3 races is very diffrent from each other.Multiplayer is good 2.A must buy
5,The BEST GAME EVER,Ok.. I am not being not overly sensitive when I say this but... IF YOU DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THERE IS SOMTHING WRONG WITH YOU! THIS IS THE BEST STRATEGY GAME EVER! CAN YOU DIG IT!
4,it's war sims!!!,"I watched my boyfriend (military man) play and i said ""another stupid war game"" but i snuck and took a crack at it and i loved it. you build up your troops and complete your mission. i'm going to buy the expansion pack too!"
5,Starcraft Rocks,This game is awesome!It's kinda out of date but who gives.I'm getting brood wars soon.Buy starcraft now!!
5,STARCRAFT RULES,THIS GAME IS AWESOME! If you are tired of stupid strategy games like command&conquer get Starcraft. Instead of having 2 sides the have almost identical types of units Starcraft has 3 sides which have entirely different types of units. Starcraft is a great game if you wish to combine warfare with economy.
4,Rufus will not let you down with his strong song writing,"""How Do You Read It?"" is the second release from Rufus Harris and his band. Drummer Jeannine Gardner, bassist Ralf Patterson, and keyboardist Sidney Howard are all featured on this release. The band shows they are all talented, and can keep up with the guitar and falsetto vocals of Rufus.The CD opens with the strong rock feel of ""How Do You Read It?"". There's no confusing the power in the song, and it definitely has some elements of Living Colour rock. The R&B vocals and rhythm section add a nice juxtaposition to the rock guitar.A highlight for me was ""Love In What You Do"", which opens with what some would consider a pop R&B sound. Lyrics cover all the various definitions of love, from a biblical perspective. This is a good solid tune, and just makes me smile.Overall this disc is excellent, and I highly recommend it."
1,Inadequate for any task,"We bought this because of its ability to withstand heat and it does that. Unfortunately, it does nothing else. It is so flimsy that it is unusable. It won't even fold batter and using it on the stove, because of its lack of tensile strength, is impossible. Buy something else is our recommendation."
4,Yet another emperor prancing around in no clothes,"I'm a bit of a maverick and a serious skeptic of experts, but even I never thought twice about the supposedly well-established state of the big bang theory.Until I read this book.The authors are to be praised for their efforts to expose an alternate viewpoint that few would otherwise be aware of, and for their courage in bucking an establishment about as entrenched in physics as evolutionists are in biology.If you tell me I'm a fool for questioning the big bang theory, and you have not been exposed to the information in this book, we have nothing to talk about. I recommend everyone get exposed."
5,Science Goes On,"Mr. Lerner's ideas deserve consideration. There are several more recent books pointing out problems with the Big Bang Model, none of which is news to those in the know. Edwin Hubble himself thought that the observed red shift may not be due to the dopler effect, and ascribed it to ""an unknown property of space."" The cosmological constant may yet rear it's ugly (and incredibly fine-tuned) head.At any rate, descriptions of the Universe change. Always have, always will."
3,A bit disappointed.,"It is somewhat out of date (1992) and should have an update or at least a new forward. It also disregards current research. Some of the assertions require a reference. While it is a good read, it is not a classic."
4,"A good subject, but not a great book","This book covers the subject well, and clearly points out the errors in the Big Bang Theory. The major drawback, however, is that the book has poor organization. For example, it is not always clear which person (H. Alfven, A. Peratt, or Lerner himself) proposes or supports which theory. It may also be slightly dated (latest version in 1992), but most recent astronomical discoveries have supported rather than refuted its conclusions (such as the report indicating that no black holes have been found in the center of any galaxy.)Anyone who realizes that the Big Bang Theory fails the test of Occam's Razor, and sometimes contradicts the facts, will like this book."
3,Wacky Good Time,"I have never read this book, or any book for that matter. But I did watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and it was a Wacky Good Time."
1,I suggest you non-believers read both sides..,"It seems to me, this is the first cosmology book you've read. Go read A Brief History of Time and The First Three Minutes. The authors of those books are Nobel Laurates. They KNOW what they're talking about. Who is this obscure Lerner?"
3,A very interesting hypothesis,"Was there a Big Bang? Beats me. But Eric Lerner's hypothesis is certainly worth exploring.Much of modern Cosmology rests on the postulated existence of ""cold, dark matter"" which can't be directly observed. It is postulated to exist because it's supposed gravitational effects are observed. Problem is, the 'gravitational effects' are assumed, by first assuming that gravity is the only long range force shaping the cosmos. This has not been shown.Mr. Lerner gets weird at times. Part of his problem with Big Bang cosmology seems to be that it isn't Marxist enough. Since Marxism isn't astronomy, who cares?What is important is that the case for the Big Bang isn't nearly as sure as some would have it. Read the book to find out more."
3,"Interesting, but needs revision","One of the principles of science is ""Ockham's Razor"", which says that the simplest explanation using natural phenomena is probably the best. This book is an interesting take on one of the main ingredients of the universe & how electromagnetic forces may take the place of Dark Matter & Dark Energy, written by a specialist in plasma science & its applications. At the time it was written, plasma cosmology was a strong no. 2 to what would become the current cosmological school of thought. Unfortunately, Lerner needs to revise his book to keep up with the observations of the last twenty years."
5,the big bang never happened,Eric Lerner has it right. His book is the best that I have read on cosmology. He makes more sense than all of the big bang theorists put together. We need more like him.
2,Outdated hypothesis already proven to be false,"Plasma cosmology was an interesting idea. Implausible from the beginning, it was nonetheless bold and refreshing. Unfortunately, the field of cosmology has witnessed an explosion of new observational results since 1992 when this book was published. These new results have largely confirmed the Big Bang Theory and blown gaping holes in plasma cosmology. This is how science progresses, however, and the author could still be proud for proposing an innovative hypothesis that at least at the time was logically consistent with known experimental results. There is no shame in having your hypothesis falsified later. The same cannot be said for knowingly indulging in unfalsifiable speculations such as String, but I have digressed."
2,A fake,"Don't let yourself get fooled by the big names. This album is really a fake. Even Brill Frisell cannot help it for a change. The compositions simply lack depth and breadth. Too much easy-listening. At first you will we enthusiastic. However, after hearing through the album for the fifth time you will be completely bored. I wonder how many of the 5-star reviewers ever tried to listen to it more than two times?"
5,Just what I was looking for,"This was just the bible I Have been searching for. FJV, wide margin, marginal references, and extra pages for my own notes. This was the only KJV that offered everything I needed, along with superior quality."
1,Not helpful,"With my circular saw giving me trouble, I picked up this book with high hopes. The book has one only page for troubleshooting tools is each of three categories (small, medium and large power tools), which is not sufficient. The pages on doing the actual repair were so vague that I immediately had to go elsewhere for assistance.As near as I tell, this book is not helpful to people who do not understand troubleshooting and repairing power tools. To use this book you do need to already have some grounding in the subject. However, if you already know about such things, then why do you need this book?"
5,Excellent source of current information,"Utilizing this book for a course in Health Delivery Systems bring the PA concept clearly into focus for PA students. Practicing Mid-level practitioners, healtcare manageres and physicians will gain a greater understanding of the roots, current utilization and future possibilities of the Physician Assistant. Well-researched and written by two ""experts"" in the field of Physician Assistant history, utilization and economics. Recommend highly for personal collection or booklist."
2,"Problem with seller, not book","The seller claimed that the book was in ""New"" condition. To me, that means pristine and undamaged. The book I received had a cover that was worn, with bent corners, and writing on the exterior of the pages. I understand that these things do not take awaiy from the integrity of the book itself, but I wouldn't have paid for a ""New"" book if I wanted it in this condition."
3,Mailing,"I was dissappointed in the mailing process. In the past, I have selected the same mailing process and received books within 5 days. This book took way too long (over 2 weeks) and therefore had to borrow another book while waiting."
3,eclectic mix of bizarre short stories..,"This early work of Patrick McGrath is an interesting mix of good and not-so-good short stories (mostly 'gothic' tales - ie, the strange, bizarre, and unexpected). While on the whole the book is enjoyable and very readable, it's hardly an example of McGrath better works. But McGrath fans will love it."
5,A unique and wonderful book,"This is an extraordinary book, a real gift for the soul. Maisy and her family ladle out wisdom, guidance, hope and love - all with humor, honesty and imagination. The genius of the book, I think, is that Ms. Huss has given us a work of true spiritual inspiration without self righteousness or religiosity. Her wisdom is accessible, her vision practical, and her characters become friends you wish you knew. I'm giving this book to my friends, which is an even better review."
2,Difficult to read,"While I absolutely love the movie, I don't recommend buying this book because it is very difficult to read. It is put together in a comic book type style, but harder to follow because the cartoon boxes are not in a row. Each page is full of cartoon boxes placed apparently randomly on the page. Buy the movie, even buy the sound track (the music is very clever), but I don't recommend buying the book."
1,Poor Quality Plasma,"We bought this Samsung 42"" TV 4 years ago, in part because their literature stated the panel is rated for 60,000 hours or 27 years at 6 hours/day use. NOT TRUE. Last week while watching a show, the pixels suddenly flashed and show a gridline up & down the screen, except for a 3"" section that was clear. Called Samsung customer support, paid for a local tech to analyze ($100 service fee) and was told the panel needed to be replaced; cost of part $475 + shipping + $125 in labor (on top of the $100 to diagnose issue). Called Samsung customer support and was told out of warranty, out of luck. Told me the 27 year, 60,000 hours was ""just an estimate"". Will never buy a Samsung TV again!! Have 16 year old Toshiba & 10 year old Mitsubishi TVs that are running well, can't say that about the Samsung."
1,Burned in 2 1/2 years,This TV burned out in 2 1/2 years and the Samsung repairman said it could not be repaired.
1,It'll work fine for TWO YEARS,"I'm writing this after a little over two years' normal, moderate use, with plenty of ventilation and no jostling around. The set has been developing the problem - and it's getting worse - of the bottom half of the screen going black. Google ""samsung plasma 4252"" and you'll find that people have been complaining about this since this model was introduced in 2001, and it's common to other Samsung models! After two years! I would judge from this that Samsung is pretty unreliable. The merits of picture quality are not an issue. Don't do Samsung."
2,wouldnt buy it again!,"well, many of the customers seem to rate it pretty good. some aspects are - HD channels show awesome. tv when not turned on looks pretty attractive... I had first problem around 8 months later.. I wasnt too satisfied with the samsung customer service as it took more than 1.5 months to get the problem fixed (it wasnt turning on!).now after my factory warranty is expired, it has a problem again... the side of the screen is blank. we can watch the tv in 4:3 mode but not in the wide screen.. pretty weird.. right?? shoot! i still regret my decision of not sticking to sony. but i remember there was around $800 difference for the same size tv.. but after this experience, i will pay that extra."
1,Stay away from this plasma TV,"Like dozens of other people whose stories you will read if you simply Google ""Samsung HP-4252"" - this tv died before the age of 4. At $2900, its simply unforgivable for Samsung to release a product with such poor quality. There is obviously something very wrong with this product to have so very many negative reviews and poor customer service stories. You can't fault someone for having bought it, despite its price tag at the time; it is a gorgeous looking television. And when it worked, it had a beautiful picture. I have have read personal account after personal account of numerous attempts to fix faulty video power supplies, video capacitors and video boards on this model. Those who succeeded in getting repair service from Samsung say the picture was never the same. The rest of us just have a really expensive boat anchor."
1,Don't buy Samsung!,"I bought the Samsung HP-4252 HD plasma tv for 2499.00. After 3 years it broke. I am yet another victim of this product. I also got the display issue and now I am looking at a $800.00+ repair. Samsung needs to step up and do something to help us out. So Samsung!, if you are reading this, extend all our warranty's so we can continue to enjoy our Samsung TV's. If not,You will lose me and a lot of other people from buying any Samsung products in the future."
1,Not working after under 4 years of light use,"I have an HPR4252X/XAA 42 inch Samsung Plasma, it is my first plasma, purchased at CircuitCity on a Thanksgiving day.just like some other users reported, today it suddenly showed distorted picture (red, blue thin lines developed in parts of the screen). I average less than 10 hours usage of this TV, it is situated in a fairly large family room. Very disappointed.David Z, Acton Massachusetts"
1,DON'T BUY!! DON'T BUY!!,This Samsung model HPR4252 will work only 2 years. After 2 years it will start giving black shadow on sides which is not repairable and to replace plasma panel for this it will cost almost the new TV price.DON'T BUY!! DON'T BUY!!!
1,warning! very dissapointed in this product,"Please be cautious buying this model or at the very least get an extended warranty. My Samsung plasma HP R4252 has essentially died after only TWO year--colored horizontal lines suddenly appeared across the front of the entire screen, ruining the picture. The Samsung service center has quoted repairs at between $600-$1,500 to replace the failed board. Samsung has so far been unwilling to extend my warrant or help with repairs. I will never buy another Samsung. A product should survive more than two years without such significant failure."
1,arty garbage,"my son gave me this CD. It's all a bunch of silly noises. Ok if you think mickey mouse cartoons are high art, I'll stick to Beethoven, thanks."
4,Pretty good,"This is another older book from Mr. Koontz that I missed in the 80's.... It did seem a little out dated, and there was a very sad part that one does not expect from him. However, as usual I read it through very quickly, he is such a masterful teller of his tales that you just can't stop reading! And as always if you have a KINDLE buy your books on it! So easy to download, they're usually always less expensive & no holding awkward heavy books or tight little paper backs!"
1,disgusting characters,This book made me ILL. I suppose there are men who would do such monstrous things but reading about them (and I love Koontz books usually) who are depraved to this degree is so terrible and terrifying at the same time that I tossed the book in the trash. What I think he owes me now is a book with a strong female lead who is totally unscathed by the bad guy and in the end she cuts off his cajones. Yes I read Tick Tock.
3,Ok I suppose,"At the time I really enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down. But looking back it really wasn't all that great. The characters were flat beyond belief and the ending rushed in that classic Koontz style. I enjoyed the book due to the theme and general idea of the whole story. A fine idea poorly expressed."
2,My least favorite Koontz novel....,"I have to say that this is my least favorite Koontz novel. It was very dull and slow. It took 100 pages before something actually happened. While I was reading the book, I hoped that it would get more exciting but it never did."
2,Not recomended,I would never ever expect a book like this from Dean. It has an interesting subject. It's about controlling people by their subconscious but the book isn't as good as the subject
1,Koontz does Laymon,"When I read this, I thought it was good, probably because I was reading a lot of Richard Laymon at the time. But thinking back this was a generally crap Koontz novel. A loose storyline linked by Laymon'esque promiscuity."
3,Satanic Porn,"I have to agree with everyone else that the idea for this book was very original. The idea of mind control is though-provoking, but the way that Koontz brings it out is a little...disgusting. All Salsbury wanted from his subliminal messages was rape and to murder women to, apparently, pay back all the people that were a part of his troubled childhood. Overall, this book was OK, in that the idea of it was good. But some of the gruesome details of rape, murder, and other disgusting situations could have been left out for a better reading experience."
2,More like Night Boredom,"If you plan on being bored out of your mind by a book you thought was going to be a psychological thriller, think again. I had more terror watching my cat stare at me while I tried to read than I did from any chapter in this perpetuating bore. A Koontz book that I found truly impressive was Shadowfires. I believe that is his best work thus far."
1,a good idea spoilt,"I don't understand why readers continue to make bestselling authors out of people who couldn't write their way out of a wet paper bag! I have read - and been disappointed - by Dean Koontz before but thought that the reviews of Night Chills sounded promising. However, his wooden characters, stereotypical and unrealistic dialogue there is no WAY that a child of the age of the little girl would ever talk or think in the way that Koontz makes her!) and plain bad prose, ruin any enjoyment I might have got from a fairly good idea. Also, Mr Koontz's stories have a well-built up beginning, a predictable nice-guys-always-win ending and absolutely no middle. Finally, surely Mr Koontz could have come up with a few more creative ways to use subliminal mind control - sex and murder get a bit old after a while. Very disappointing. Won't be buying any more books by this author."
4,"NIGHT CHILLS A FAST PACED, SHOCKING READ.","Once I started this book, I could not put it down. Dean Koontz has a way to hook the reader from the first page, and then reel you in through the course of the story. I'm not going to write a synopsis of the story, there is enough of that already here. I will say it's a very good read. The story moves along at a pleasant clip. The concept is interesting, and the characters are very well done. That said, there are a few shocking events throughout this read and may not be for the faint of heart.I have only read a handful of books by Dean Koontz (Whispers, Phantoms, Lighting, Servants of the twilight, and Intensity), and enjoyed them all. He is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. I can't wait to read them all. However, there are so many. Where do I start?"
4,My first Koontz book.,"I've read many, many zombie books and recently I've been expanding into other books. I saw Night Chills at Wal-mart. The cover hooked me and I've been waiting to read a Dean Koontz book for a while so I bought it. The first few paragraphs really hooked me. I've never believed in subliminal advertising, but Koontz paints a nice fantasy world where something like that could control people.I enjoyed Night Chills. Some of the acts in this book were a bit too much to swallow. But overall, it was entertaining and kept me hook 'til the end."
4,GREAT!!!,"This book was a great read for me. Koontz is my total favorite author. This book was not only captivating, but it sure did keep my attention. The scary part about this book is that almost everything (with the exception of the drug) is true. Subliminal advertising is not a very big part of our lives right now, but could become something very very big in the future. If there's one thing that I learned from this book, it's that technology is not always good. In this case it was abused to the extreme. You have to be a very mature reader to even open this book. The author's prolouge explains it all. Thank you for your time."
2,rather boring,"The book, because written in the 70s, seemed rather old fashioned, although the topic of mind-controlling is always actual. The chief villain Ogden seemed rather one-dimensional because of his obsession to humiliate and rape all women within his reach. What the author really managed to do is to raise profound feeling of disgust for him. Otherwise, quite an ordinary ""train reading stuff""."

3,For most authors a great book but for Koontz just good,Let me start by saying that yes this is a dark book but no it's not shocking or outlandish. What I'm saying is the things that the scientist did is not at all unbelievable. Someone who wants to devote his life to a mind control project is obviously power hungry. Then you add to that his terrible past and I would be quite suprised to see him act in any other way then the way he did.For this reason I give as much as three stars. Because Koontz was truthful and did not shy away from reality even though it would be grotesque. Know the reason I only gave three and not more is the simple fact that mind control just doen't interest me that much. But if your into that sort of thing or simply want a thriller to read then this book could be just the right book for you.
1,virtues and faults of Koontz,"Dean Koontz is one of the best suspense writers around. His book ""Watchers"" was one of the best that I have ever read. However, his similarity in his stories has become way too much. The 30-something couple, the dog, the house they work on, paranormal events, funhouses, enough!He has no right to be on the bestseller list every time."
4,"Worst Koontz yet, but still a 7",Great start......boooooooring finale. I think I was under some form of mind control by the half-way point. Nothing significant seems to remain in my memory from that point forward. Interesting topic. Not well completed.
3,Starts Out Chilly and Ends Up Luke Warm....,"I can't say that I am a big Dean Koontz fan and that is simply due to the publishing of this type of mediocre, blazee, run-of-the-mill ""horror"" book. Koontz can write some pretty scarey stuff. This book had some great potential...a drug that can cause people to respond to psychic suggestion. Then Koontz gets his villan all caught up in sex, power and domination. Blah, blah, blah. What kind of evil genius works his whole life to perfect this ""potion"", markets it to the right people, places it in the right town for testing, and then blows the whole deal by following his suddenly out of control libido? Tisk, tisk on Koontz for ruining a really good premise and story line with sex (which I like...sex that is...just not in this case). Sorry Dean, this one doesn't get better with age."
2,Blah!,"I didn't like this book. It started out interesting. The whole idea of the power of suggestion is intriguing. The novel was weighed down heavily by excessive, dirty sex scenes and characters I didn't care a flip about. This isn't a gem and Koontz can do better."
4,Not Koontz's best but good read.,"Really, I should give it three and a half stars, but I'm forced to round off. Warning: this is Koontz's most sexually explicit book by a country mile. This doesn't bother me in the least but some of the scenes could be rough for the easily offended."
5,Amazing Album,"This album is an amazing follow up to ""You Make Us Sick""(also a great record). The lyrics have really come a long way, the production is great, the music is fast and full of energy. Definetly be sure to check out their live show! Two other great hardcore bands from Maine are Wake Up Call and On The Outside. Buy this record!"
3,Marginal satisfaction,I bought this Cd on a whim because it was down in the penny purchase range hoping to stumble upon a good jam. Very very mediocre some of the music is all right but the vocals are nothing more then screaming badly into the mic.
1,Unless you are a die hard Bootleg fan...,skip this album. There are maybe one or two good tracks on this cd. I have never written a review on here but fealt that I should just because this album does not deserve a five. In fact it doesn't deserve two. I am changing my review to one star. Do not buy this album!
5,Look Ma ! No Limp!,"Whoda thunkit. After living with Gout for ten years, Cyril Scott cures me in 93 pages. Although Scott touts cider vinegar as a pancea for the ages, resolving everything from Vertigo to thin toe nails, he does admit that it cannot counteract evil vices. This small book has proven itself in my single ailment alone and there are no side affects as there are with conventional chemical therapy. If I hadn't suffered for so long I never would have believed that a little fermented apple juice could be so amazing. This book can cure what ails you."
5,Nice,"Must have,Must have, inspiring, enlightening, eye opening, good, heart felt enlightening, must have in your own library, book to keep and give"
5,Practical Mysticism,"This is a book about ideas & practices that the Author has worked at. He doesnot burden the pages with a display of learning but in simple and lucid language stresses the contemporary values of ancient texts with special references to the present day environments. The book is compact and yet complete, shorn of elaborations and complications with real power to direct our lives so as to increase awareness on balanced living with mental and physical well-being. It helps to repair our faded and fragmentary conceptions of life. Joyce Amor.........Pune 411001, INDIA."
4,"Great history, not much for modern readers.","Material better covered either by the billion treatises on humane interface development, by the various ""97 Things"" books or Robert Martin's ""The Clean Coder.""But come on it's got a chapter called ""Lie to your Boss"" that every young software upstart should read."
2,It's virtue is its brevity!,"Writing a review of this book is not hard; much easier thanactually reading the book. On the one hand, there's a pony in here.On the other, you have to dig through a fairly deep pile to find it. My suggestion, if you buy this book, is to go to chapter 17 (p129 of 178) and skim the remainder; while there aren't really any well-stated principles to apply, there's some insight that may prove valuable. Overall, there's enough good stuff to make a decent sized article in InfoWeek; but not a complete book. Digging through the remainder is compounded by the arrogant and condescending style of the author. Most of his experiences are derived from the Andrew project at CMU."
2,why did i waste my money?,this game was just ok. i thought the multiplayer sucked. co -op mode was good but all the other modes sucked. The levels were horrible and it was extremely easy to kill people. you could just go in there with a grenade launcher and blow the heck out of everybody. I thought the multiplayer was fun but on the third level underground it was confusing what to do. Alot of times the enemies on normal level would shoot at you for forty-five seconds and you would barely be damaged.
2,"Crappy, but a lot of muliplayer maps","This game is a little corny and a little crappy for an FPS in campaign mode, but there are a lot of fair multiplayer options. Destructible environments, many different weapons, tons of maps (more than I've ever seen in a game), many goofy looking creatures to choose from, and 1 thing the people of Bungi forgot: BOTS! Although the Bot AI is just random - they run around and shoot, run around and shoot. Always running, never stopping. Still, the multiplayer is worth a couple bucks in the discount bin if you find it."
4,"Better than Halo, not as good as Half-Life","This is an excellent port of the Ps2 version and includes the cool geo-mod engine. but it falls short on gameplay, THERE ISN'T ENOUGH, it will only take you a few sittings to complete this game, but it does have upsides!The geo-mod engine, which was almost completely ignored in the first one is back and better, including several missions that require you to alter your surroundings.If you're sick of Halo, give this a try, but try before you buy."
2,Dissappointing,"I saw this game in the store and grabbed it right away, after playing the first Red Faction I thought this would only be better. I was wrong.If you are looking for something better than the first Red Faction, this is not it, keep on looking."
5,Lovely,"I wear these earrings frequently and always receive compliments on them. For me they are just right - not a bit flimsy, nor are they too heavy. I've been wearing them frequently for over a year yet they are in as good condition as when they were brand new."
2,"This book is worth purchasing, but was disappointing.","This book does give you a good historical lesson on Pale Ales. If you truly love Pale Ale, I do recommend this book; but it is quite factual and somewhat boring at times.As a homebrewer that brews extract beers, I was pleased that the book did offer extract recipes; however, the number of recipes was somewhat limited.I certainly do not mean any disrespect, but I was disappointed by the book's excessive use of exclamation marks. In my opinion, they give the book a sarcastic tone.However, if you enjoy Pale Ales as much as I do, relax, get this book, and have a homebrew."
3,Ok book - wish it were better. Too pedantic.,I was disappointed with this book. I found some contradictory statements in it as well as being too pedantic and even technical. I brew; but some of this technical info is not really needed for what i make. I am not so concerned about putting everything in neat tiny boxes. That is why I experiment and make my own varied styles. (I love porter and have his Porter book. To short; but also too technical.) I find that maybe 20-25 pages of the total book is worth anything to me. Sorry I spent the $ on it now. can only sell it back for 35 cents. not good.
2,"Repetition, repetition, repetition","Great topic, but unfortunately very poorly written. Although I appreciate the authors' attempt to explain their ideas without the use of equations (although a few simple ones would have been nice), the book lacks organization, and is replete with repeated ideas. I don't know if it really adds anything new to what's out there already."
2,Prigogine Re-written,"This book is basically a re-hash of Prigogine's fantastic work.Read the original, ""Chaos out of order""."
3,BEWARE: Not compatible with all CRT monitors,"The card has good specs for the price point. BUT...It has the most bizarre, frustrating issue I've seen in a long time. The card is not compatible with all CRT monitors. On some monitors when the display driver (any version at all) is loaded the display blanks (goes into standby mode) and will not come back on. Others report that if you do not power up the monitor until Windows completely boots, and then turn on the CRT, it works. For me, one monitor works the other doesn't. With both monitors plugged in, only one blanks. Must be some type of hardware design bug. XFX will not tell you this!"
5,My Lovebirds love this nest box,I ordered this for the price and received it in less than a week. I put some papershred in it and my female lovebird had a clutch of 5 eggs within two weeks. We now have 5 healthy lovebird chicks. This was an instant hit with my lovebirds.
2,dimensions,"It would be nice if the product dimensions were the same in the ""PRODUCT DETAILS"" and ""PRODUCT DESCRIPTION"". one has the dimensions as 8x8x8 and the other 10x6.9."
4,Great costume!,"We bought this costume as a halloween costume for our 8 month old son. Unlike many other costumes available for his age group, this was made of a higher quality material and a much better buy for the money. It wasn't sewn perfectly (sleeves we disproportionately too long) but again, for what we needed it for and for the price it was worth it."
2,Good Movie Poor Disk,"For any lovers of Big Band music, this disk is a must. The problem is that I purchased two different copies of this disk and played them on two different machines and got the same result. The disk has a problem and wouldn't play after about 10 minutes. I finally used the scene selection and the disk played the rest of the movie but a portion just won't play. Otherwise, I have the tape of this movie and enjoyed the music and the story behind the Dorsey Brothers. It did capture their music both together and apart. It has some normal Hollywood gimmicks to try and make the picture better but in my opinion, it just makes it a little hammy. Overall, if you can get a good copy of this movie and you enjoy the Big Bands, this is a must for your collection..."
2,"Boring and repulsive, except...","Except for the two stories by Chico Kidd (They had been my introduction to her work, but thereafter I had to search for more and came across the top-notchSummoning Knells and Other Inventions) and one extraordinary erotic fever dream by Graham Joyce, the rest are trash, being a goulash of gore, sex, mysticism and attempted humour. It is evident from this fare that Stephen Jones has been losing his touch for quite some time now, and the throne rightfully belongs to Ellen Datlow."
2,Not that good,"Not strong and fast paced enough for me. I like quick stories that flow and catch your attention! Definitely more slow, perhaps ""spooky"" but not quite horror stories. If you can get it cheap, grab it for a few of the stories, but the editor didnt seem to be interested in keeping the readers attention so I wouldnt pay much more than a few dollars for this one. I have over 300 anthologies and didnt bother keeping this one."
3,"Good, but could've been better.","I really enjoyed this, though there were a few things that really bugged me. Like the way the author uses the word crumble in place of the word crumple. She does this in Beautiful Lies, too. Also don't understand why Ridley just accepts that Max is her father with no evidence other than him saying so. Someone else claimed to be her father, too, and there was no reason for her or the readers to think he wasn't. Between that and the other unanswered questions from the first book, I could've been a lot more satisfied with this book. That being said, it was a good read once it got going, though I don't know if I'd recommend buying it at full price."
2,CAREFUL...THIS IS A REISSUE!,I really enjoyed the book when it was originally published. This is a reissue with a new cover. Be aware that you may have already read it.
4,Plot explosion,"This is the follow-up to Lisa Unger's first novel, Beautiful Lies. I absolutely loved Beautiful Lies. It was fast-paced, the plot was intriguing, the ending was good and the characters were interesting, relatable and complex. This book was good but not quite as good as the first one. The plot sort of explodes onward from where it left off in Beautiful Lies and becomes a little bit unruly. Also, the book was a little heavy on the foreshadowing of future plot points. That said, it was very enjoyable to read and I zipped through it very quickly. I just picked up her third book, Black Out, which is not a continuation of the first two, and am looking forward to reading it."
2,disappointment,This book was a huge disappointment. I am not sure why Lisa Unger chose to dump the character Jake and create a new guy for this book. It just made the storyline confusing and flat. Maybe she should bring back Jake and the romance in another book. Not a fun read.
4,Fast shipping!,I just have to say that this was fast shipping! I ordered about 6 other items from various sellers on the same day and this was the first item I got! Thank you so much. And I will definitely be ordering more in the future!
3,Disappointing,"Pure drivel. I read ""Beautiful Lies"" and was pleased to find out there was a sequel. I was bored to death from the beginning of the book and yawned my way through to the end. I want a refund."
5,FANTASTIC,"I have had this set plus some extras from open stock for a few years. I love this set! I have used it daily for every type of cooking, and I LOVE to cook! My only problem is not with this item, but with the fact I can't find it any more! My husband had ruined a couple on pieces, used and abused on a camping trip with his buddies then proceeded to do the worst thing to a hot pan, dumped it in COLD WATER. Why is it when something as great as this product comes out (not to mention at a great price) they do away with it???? PLEASE FABERWARE, BRING THIS BACK!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Great set for decent price...,Pros: 1. decent price2. look expensive3. Non-Stick..once I had a dish in my pan and unfortunately forgot about it. It burned but I could just simply slide it from the pan...I loved not having to scrape the reminents :)Cons: 1. Handle on the lid gets hot after a while.2. handle for the pans seems quite long to me.On and On I am quite satisfied with the set....
3,SO - SO,"I bought 2 sets of these pans. One set for my newly married son and a set for myself because the price was great.These are OK pans. Just ok. They are non-stick coated on the inside, which is not described in the description. They cook nice and evenly, but all the handles get too hot to touch.They are a decent starter set, but I would not recommend these if you prefer anything better than ""starter"""
5,Prunella Scales if fabulous,"This is the audio tape to buy. Unless, you dislike Mrs. Bates in the 1997 adaptation of Emma (with Kate Beckinsale)-then you may not like it as the same actress (Prunella Scales) read the entire text. In my opinion she does an excellent job. Of course, you have to really appreciate Jane Austen to want the unabridged version-but presumably you do if you are considering this purchase. It is very entertaining and energetic. You don't find you mind wandering as you might with other more dull readers. I highly recommend it!"
5,David Carradine's Tai Chi for the Body and Mind,"This 2 tape set is an excellent introdution to Tai Chi Chuan by David Carradine. Well photographed and expertly choreographed; Mr. Carradine leads the viewer on a brief and simple (And very beneficial) calming workout that leaves one relaxed and at the same time, invigorated. An excellent companion video set to Mr. Carradine's Tai Chi for Beginners and Chi Kung Workout. The viewer will get that close knit one on one feeling with Mr. Carradine, and feel that this workout was created just for them. Excellent job David."
1,Kung Fuy,"This guy really irks me; always trying to pass himself off as a Martial Artist just because he starred in the TV series ""Kung Fu"". He's a joke in the Martial arts community. His forms are atrocious, and his advice should never be listened to."
4,Good Machine,"You will most likely need 2 people to put this together. Or 1 mechanically inclined person. I did it alone but it was a struggle, I was too tired to use it when I was finished.It is a nice solid machine, with good programmable options, espically for the price. It is a little less smooth turning than I'd like, so it has a little more of a walking/running feel than the expensive ellipticals you use at the gym, but the important part was to lessen the impact on the knees which this machine does effectively.For the price, it is a well-built machine. I would reccommend it."
1,A piece of junk!!!,"I purchased this item in September 2009. Within 30 days the monitor quit recording distance and calories burned. This was annoying, but the machine still worked great, so no worries. I use this machine about 3 days a week for 20-30 minutes, so it is not used heavily. It recently developed a horrendous popping noise in the main body of the machine. It will now not increase resistance, or once it does, it will not decrease the resistance. The monitor completely shuts down in the middle of a work out, which is very annoying. I have owned this machine less than a year, and already I am going to have to give it away and try to find something else. I had a Tony Little ""gazelle"" before this that I paid 85.00 for. I put over 500 miles on that machine before it gave out. This is definitely not worth the money or time. I had thought by buying a machine that got such a high star rating that I would get my money's worth, BIG mistake. Do not waste your time with this product."
2,It was ok,I bought this machine thinking it would be better... It was VERY heavy.. Put it together in about an hour and a half.. Returned it a week later.. I felt it was not worth the money.. It was not very smooth.. and overall was just not satisfied. Hoping my return goes through with no problem. It was not easy getting it packed back up again.
5,Outstanding book,"It's really hard to say too many things about this book. Even older editions of Color Drawing are great, but this newest one goes above and beyond the call of duty. In an age when a lot of books get re-released as new editions with few substantive changes, Color Drawing breaks the mold by updating the techniques with current technology (i.e. Photoshop). It's great to see that the author and publisher realize that pure hand-drawing and rendering is quickly becoming a thing of the past and that the practitioners of today and tomorrow need to have excellent computer skills too. This book is full of very useful tips for combining Photoshop with hand drawings to create great effects. So even if you have an earlier edition, do yourself a favor and buy the new one anyway because you will learn a lot."
2,Not quite as bad as pts. 1 and 2,"""Rebels"" pt. 3 was an O.K. conclusion to the overall poor series. I read ""Vengeance"", also by the author, which was bad, but thought I'd give him another chance; a big mistake. It was the fourth time I'd wished a ST novel would hurry and end; the other three times were Rebels 1&2 and Vengeance. As far as content, the turnaround of the Natives was nice to see, you feel for them throughout the series. The characterization was not the best. I thought Odo was too negative even for Odo, and Dax got on my nerves with her uncharacteristic bloodlust. The most upsetting thing is that we never learn who those people on the cover are! I'd assumed the woman was Sister Winn, but never in the three books does she pick up a weapon (except for a knife) and there was no prominent male Bajoran characters to explain the two men. Overall, I'm disappointed in my self for wasting $19.50 on this series."
5,STAR TREK BOOKS,If you love Star Trek like I love Star Trek then chances are you have already read the series the rebels trilogy books which takes place when the cardassans was in control of deep space nine before it became deep space nine.Rondall Banks
1,Short battery life makes this watch not worth it,"I bought this watch in August and it died in February. It was o.k. while it lasted, but I was expecting to get at least a year's worth of use. Paying for a watch that only lasts 7 months is no deal. I won't buy this brand again."
5,Le Chateau Watch with Roman Numerals,"I recently purchased a Le Chateau watch. The face of the watch is beautiful with its black background, gold Roman numerals, and a discrete window indicating the date. The black leather band is sleek and gives the whole watch a look of distinction. Because I have a small wrist, the face of watches don't usually fit nicely,however, this one does. I have found lots of look-a-likes but the Le Chateau version is more petite and form-fitting. Overall, the watch is lovely and can be worn with dressy or casual wear. I have received lots of compliments!"
2,I never thought I'd say this...,"...about a Chick Corea Elektric Band recording: Too many notes. There is so little space in this music that I find it a fatiguing listen. The musicianship is astoundng, as usual. The recording quality is excellent. Most of the charts aren't bad at all either. But, it seems to me that these guys went one step, and only one step, too far along the virtuosity scale. It seems that they are just barely staying out of one another's way.I'm normally a huge fan of the Elektric Band. In this case, I'd have to recommend one of their other recordings, particularly the stellar ""Eye of the Beholder"" over this one."
2,"how to justify the high price? oh, yes...","...give 'em selections from the book! Great! I dont have to buy the book now as I've read the Cliffs notes for it.Got it @ Virgin for %40 off just prior to them closing. Am I glad I didnt pay the full price of $18.99! And all the $ goes to the Church of Scientology I bet.And for just 7 good songs out of 17.I couldnt care less of Mr.Corea's religious views, or his beliefs in the writings of the science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, creator of Dianetics, and that crackpottery called Scientology.Look, just rip the 7 songs, burn to MP3, and leave the rest.I sure hope his other albums are much better though, otherwise, he will go the way of Carlos Santana, it's all in the past."
2,Almost Useless,"While this product seems to clean up stains pretty well, it has done nothing to deter our cat from spraying. In fact, the spraying has INCREASED dramatically in the same areas where the product has been used. If you're looking for a product to eliminate spraying, this isn't it."
2,confused,"I guess I was a little confused as to what this product could accomplish. I wanted something that would deter the cat from spraying on the bathroom and entry hall rugs. While I know that dumb cat is not a repellent, I thought it was supposed to eat away the enzymes and scents that make the cat want to ""repeat offend"" there. For what Dumb Cat says it does, it does seem to work. It does take the scent and effectually removes the urine. However, this does NOTHING to stop the cat from returning there and doing it again... and again... and again..."
1,Didn't Work for Me,"This product did NOT work at all. Our cat peed in one place (he is a neutered male), but the smell has lingered for days. We've sprayed, soaked, sprayed soaked, sprayed soaked with this product, and the smell has diminished but it's still there. Sprinkling baking soda on the spot helped the smell more than this product did. Complete waste of money. But maybe my cat's urine is stinkier than others, who knows, but this product cannot cut through my cat's pee like baking soda can."
3,Didn't work for my cat.,"This didn't work for my cat that like to go to bathroom on my small rugs. I used it per the directions, but my cat simply did not take to it. I don't blame the product. Every pet is different and it was worth a try, since there were some good reviews for the product. I did not care for the scent much, but that it is not meant to smell like potpourri. I ended up working out my cats issues by getting a top entry litter box and using clay litter. I wanted to use natural litter, but it turns out my cat didn't like it at all. She likes the top entry box for privacy. Every cat's issue is different, so don't give up if this doesn't work for you."
1,Don't waste your money...worthless product,I read the reviews on this but wanted to try it for myself. The smell of this stuff is horrendous and smells like rotting vegetables or flowers or something just bad. Not sure if it is working to get the odor out but it does not do anything to keep the cats away from the spot. They don't care and I watched them walk up and smell it and still start going so I wouldnt waste your money. Not sure what the company is trying to prove with the smell of this stuff but it aint working.
1,Beauty is Skin Deep,"Hands down, The most stylish toaster out there. If you are looking for a striking accent for your counter top but don't intend to use it, this is the toaster for you. When I called to return it, no questions were asked. They even paid the shipping! This will be my last Delonghi purchase."
2,unpredictable,"The toaster has good looks and fits on the counter very well; however, it prooved to be completely unpredictable when it came to actual toasting. For example, on the lightest setting the toast would be very lightly toasted or burned black, with either outcome on the same setting occurring repeatedly. Therefore you could not predict how the toaster would react on specific settings. Disappointing."
1,All Show and no Function,"I bought this toaster despite all the bad reviews I read here. Well, they were all correct. This is the most contemporary and stylish designed toaster on the market but if you in fact like to use it for toasting bread...DON'T BOTHER. It burns the bread every time even on the lowest setting. Buy this toaster for show not function."
1,Whoever worked on this product should be embarrassed,"I returned this after one day of use. The unit I received toasted the side towards the center WAY more than the other side. Even from one end to the other it was really inconsistent. In addition, even at the lightest setting, the one dark side was consistently charred black. I'm not sure how anyone actually manages to use this toaster. The automatic lowering feature was cool, but unfortunately the toast that came out was inedible.I purchased theBreville CT75XL Ikon 4-Slice Electric Toasterand have been quite happy with it, I suggest you try it first."
2,Great Looks but Look Elsewhere,"High hopes for this fantastic looking toaster. Initially it worked well, then as with some of the other reviewers, it began to work unevenly, toasting one side of the bread or bagel much more than the other. It also started getting fussy about staying down in toasting mode after inserting a piece of bread. Eventually, just after 1 year of age, the chip that controls the toaster completely failed and the toaster will no longer stay down. A real disappointment."
1,Anna is a robot,I purchased this workout video hoping that it would be as good as previous DVDs. Not so. Anna is robotic and not motivating at all. It's probably a good thing she left the show. I could not wait for her 3 segments to be over. Will be returning the other DVD with her in it.
4,Very cute!,"I like the look and size of this bookshelf. The problem was that when I screwed in the frames to the base, the screw went through the other side of the wood, causing noticable damage to the wood. Even my 2 year old noticed it. Still trying to see if I can just replace the part. Other than that, I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Servent of our Lord,"I have been a fan of Twila's for most of my life. True North is such a joy to listen to and is right on target. My favorite songs are ""Wisdom"" and ""Could you believe"". I consider Twila to be a mentor and strongly recomend her music to anyone. Her music will speak to you where ever you are in your relationship with Christ. Thank you Twila for using your gifts for God's glory. You and your music are among God's countless blessings."
5,No Confidence,"This CD is truly a blessing from the Lord and definetly God breathed and inspired. No Confidence .... in the flesh. Talks about how we as Christians, even thought we may be saved, sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost, but under no circumstances are we to ever believe that we in our own flesh can handle life without God! AWESOME ! CD. From beginning to end this CD is a breath of life. A must have in your CD changer."
1,Twila's WORST album.,"I personally am an avid listener of her music because I felt that her music is very sincere and worshipful. HOWEVER, this album-along with ""Beyond a Dream"" - is packed with songs that are very rock and pop-oriented. And there are fewer worship songs on her album. It is not up to her usual standards. It seems that the album was made with a certain sound to up the sales. Even though SOME ofthe words on A FEW of the songs are great but it has that worldly sound. If you have noticed Twila's BEST selling records and the ones that won her the most accolades are the ones that have the most rock-sounding beats (e.g Beyond a Dream, Where I Stand)I was highly disappointed when I bought the album. PLEASE save your money. Most of her other material is good. This is one of those rare exceptions. This is not one of her albums that are worth buying."
3,Fits together Akwardly,"This HD enclosure is a great tool, especially if you need to extend your HD with USB. However, it is made from a metal frame that screws together and the metal is not cut correctly so some of the side panels will fall out."
5,Item works great!,This item worked great for me. Easy to use. The cooling fan helped keep the drive cool when I was scanning for viruses and defraging.
3,Too cliche and predictable,I found the story to be to filled with cliche comments (always the same) and could predict them easily. To much emphasis on the sex. I didn't think I was reading a lonely wifes romance novel but that is what it seemed like with a bit of gore thrown in.
2,"Good story, but poorly executed.","First let me say if you're looking for a good horror, don't read this. It's more of crime drama with a supernatural spin. The only monster at the end of this book is a good guy, the bad guy is just a serial killer, whose's human. This isn't what makes this book bad in my opinion, it's the author's over describing of details that are quite frankly, irrelevant. There's way too many pages telling us what's going on inside the character's heads, which makes the story move slowly. I starting skipping paragraphs just to get back to the point. One of the main charactes, Nick's other love interest, wasn't even introduced until later in the story. She just seems to be added to the story for the sake of the ending. Then the author adds a bunch of rednecks towards the end just help build the climax, which just made it drawn out and unsatisfying. Too many shifts in characters to keep the focus of the ending."
1,Disappointing.,"I love vampire/werewolf/paranormal stories as a rule, but just couldn't get through this one. I thought it was annoyingly over-written. The author spends so much time telling us what's going on inside Nick's head that the story itself suffers. And the jumping back and forth in time is distracting. I was only able to get through one-quarter of the book before I put it down.The author obviously has talent, but this book could have used some serious editing."
5,Wolf's Trap,The book was purchase for a Christmas present. It is in excellent condition and the price was right.Amazon keep up the good work and selecting quality and caring suppliers.Marilyn Gordon
3,Basic Phone,"The Kyocera KX414 is my second phone. After losing my Motorola V267, I was forced to use my parent's old phone, which happened to be the Kyocera KX414. Overall it is a good basic cell phone. No games come with the phone. To get games you have to download them for a price (Which Half Of The Games Aren't Even Worth) on the Get It Now service. Changeable faceplates are a hassle to change. To change a faceplate you have to buy a special screwdriver.Pros: Text Messaging, Good Service, Fits In Pocket Real Easy, Barely Any Dropped CallsCons: Small Screen, Very Short Battery Life, Weak Vibration, and Annoying RingtonesOverall It is a good basic phone for someone who wants a phone just to use once in a while. I recommend spending a little more for a better phone than this."
2,Mediocre at best,"I was forced to purchase this phone as a refurbished unit because my previous phone broke and since Verizon's customer service is difficult to deal with, I had no other choice. The phone does not compare to my Samsung a670.Pros: Seems fairly durable, loud ring if the right one is selected.Cons: No camera, cannot receive pic messages, text messaging hard to use, buttons are very stiff, small screen, difficulty navigating options, shortcuts useless.I would recommend this phone to somebody who doesn't care too much about extras and is using the phone strictly for calling people. Stay away from this phone if you use features such as text messaging, camera etc..."
1,Poor performance,"I have had this phone almost two years. Its been replaced once, and the batteries have been replaced as well. It works great for a while, then it gets to where it won't hold a charge when not in use. And if you use it, you get like 20 minutes max talk time before its completely dead. Kyocera won't replace it, verizon won't replace it, so i charge my phone repeatedly.We unfortunately got three of these phones and all three of them have the same issues, so I am inclined to think it is not an isolated incident.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE."
3,"good, reliable phone",I have had this phone fo 2 years and have never had any trouble. I went to Jamaica and still had full service. I have never had any problem with the phone staying charged.
1,the worst phone in the world,"Perhaps this is the worst phone in the world. I gave it 1 star because there is no zero star. Don't touch it, otherwise I am sure you will regret as I did. The horrible battery can only let you talk for 15 minutes after full charged and then does not let you talk when charging. That is the most stupid thing I have ever seen. The phone is crappy and easy to be broken. I really admire those Kyocera people who can make things so bad."
4,A sadly out of print classic of experimental literature.,"Shipwrecked European travelers are held for ransom in an imaginary African kingdom. While they wait for the payment they set up a series of entertainments to keep their spirits up. These performances are the main focus of Roussel's book, an often neglected classic of experimental literature. The first half comprises objective descriptions of bizarre individual talents and strange ""technological"" demonstrations. The second half explains to the reader what he has just read: the background of the participants and the origins of their skills.Trying to describe Roussel's enigmatic novel in 1000 words is impossible. While the book is currently not available, readers can check out an extract in Roussel's ""How I Wrote Certain of My Books,"" an excellent volume itself, which contains sections form some of Roussel's other works and John Ashbery's translation of Roussel's essay explaining his fascinating methods of composition."
4,The ideas in this book are revolutionary!!,"The ideas that Immanuel Kant wrote about are truly groundbreaking. The concept of a cosmopolitan existence can arguably be seen in the existense of the European Union. Really amazing stuff! Now you may ask ""why then are there only four stars?"". The reason that I have given this book four stars is that it captured Kant's words beautifully, but somehow forgot to dissect their meaning for the reader. The concept of rights can be very confusing and without a thorough explanation can leave the passive reader (and for that matter even an active reader at times)confused and frustrated. The price for the book itself is reasonable and I feel that it most definately will give you your money's worth."
1,Stupid book for a stupid class.,"If your teacher is requiring you to buy this book, just get out of the class now, unless you wear skinny jeans and emo hair."
3,Not for busy families,"Healthy, perhaps; but simple? My problem with this book was that I couldn't just start with a trip to the grocery store. For example, in order to make one dish, one must first have made 'poultry brown base sauce.' In order to make this, one must first have made 'brown chicken stock,' which means one must have roasted several pounds of bones, then simmered them with vegetables and seasonings for a couple of hours...you get the idea. The proper French method, of course, but I began to long for a dish that could be made with (gasp) canned broth or even a boullion cube. I found this book inferior to the superb--don't let the grim title fool you--AMA family health cookbook. Assuming your supermarket has good produce, Asian, and Latin sections, any of it's recipes are easily achievable. And delicious."
5,Pepin cookbook,"I am a fan of the tv programs with Jacques Pepin and after checking out this book at the library, I decided to get it. It has calorie counts on every recipe, also."
2,Perhaps a little too thin?,"I was a bit disapponted with many of the recipes in this book either because they seriously lacked flavor or just didn't turn out right. Also, I agree with the title in the sense that the dishes described in it are healthy, but quite a few are far from being simple (or, conversely, they are so simple that they're boring). On the bright side, I did enjoy many of his dessert recipes, particularly his fruit-based ones. Also, Pepin's example menus are quite creative and helpful, provided that you can do something to dress up the flavor of the actual meals. There is no question in my mind that Jacques Pepin is perhaps one of the most talented and respected chefs of our time, but this particular book just seems to fall short."
3,"Good music, horrible sound","The first 4 songs taken from the split LP ""Hordanes Land"" with Enslaved are excellent. The sound quality isn't bad, the guitars have a buzzsaw urgency, great drumming, Ihsahns vocals are especially nasty and you can hear the bass. It sounds like a good amateur recording of a top notch performance. I give this part of the CD 4 stars only because Emperor put out so many great full-length albums afterwards.The rest of the CD is for historical completists only. The sound quality is so f*cking bad that I can't listen to it. It sounds like a practice session recorded on a portable cassette player using the built-in condensor mike. The real shame is that the songs are very strong. You can tell the band has something. I'm pissed off that Emperor didn't re-record more of these songs 'cause this sonic shipwreck just doesn't cut it. One star.4 stars plus 1 star equals 3 stars."
3,"Cute story, just didn't keep my 2 year old's attention","My daughter likes to read toot & puddle books, but for some reason she wasn't into the movie. Maybe next year."
5,a beautiful little movie,"I watched this with my then 3-year-old son last Christmas. I'm very picky about cartoons (find most of the new Disney stuff obnoxious and lean towards Japanese cartoons like My Neighbor Totoro), and this met all my criteria: beautiful, whimsical animation; likable characters; and a simple, not overly done plot. We get to see some of the characters prepare for Christmas in Woodcock Pocket, while the rest are celebrating a family reunion in Scotland. The message here is to find beauty and joy in friends, family, and the ""work"" of Christmas. When I turn on the tv to watch a movie with my child, this is what I want to see. I'm about to go out and buy it now so we can watch it this week before Christmas."
5,Solid Album - A Must Have,"I heard about this album on [...] 25 Greatest Hip Hop Groups of All Time, which is remarkable considering this group hasn't been around that long, or at least to my knowledge. It's a very different sounding style of Hip Hop, that's for sure. If I had to classify their genre of Hip Hop, I'd probably call it a ""soothy synthy"" kind of melody to the production and lyrical content. It's actually a very relaxing album for a Hip Hop album which is rare to find. But I was delighted. I enjoyed this album. I wouldn't recommend it for those occasions where you just want to listen to Hip Hop music that's going to pump you up but it's a good album to chill on for those who know what I'm talking about."
4,Tha strange is good.,"This is a real breath of fresh air from all of the other rap albums released recently that all seem to be bland or devoid of all originality. This groups latest album is a critical blow to the critics who say southern rappers have no substance in their lyrics. The guest on this album are kept to a minimum. Cee-Lo makes an appearance on Caved In, which has a beat that will stick in your head hours after you've finished listening to it. It woulda been nice to have Cee spit a verse but he's only on the hook. Tonedeff makes it on this album on tha somber The Gates. Great lyrics and fresh original beats makes sure that this album shines above all of tha muck that's been keeping rap from advancing.Notable Tracks:Nothing To GiveHourglassBrain CellAmerica Loves GangstersThe Gates"
5,One of the best cds ever,"Anyone who like CunninLynguists will like their new cd. Its got some of their usual sound, and some new stuff mixed in. Its a gret cd, check it out"
1,Nothing like the previous albums,"If you are a fan of 'will rap for food', dont expect to like this album. A couple tracks are ok, but its just that, theres nothing special about this album. In my opinion, its garbage and i wouldnt call it that underground. Maybe i was just expecting something better after seeing that the album was sold out on ughh.com. Maybe thats why none of the actual songs are playable, so u will buy it before u hear it and end up wasting your money on crap. Dont get me wrong, Im a fan of Mr. Sos and kno, but this album just sucked. I remember the first time i heard lynguistics on will rap for food. I fell in love with that song. Theres no song even close on this album that give u that same feeling. If u can listen to the album somewhere else before u waste your money, youll be happy u did."
2,VERY disappointing,"More like a talk a safety instructor might give to high school students than a work on body language. (It would be good for that.)The book (5 1/2 x 8 1/2) is just 63 pages and the actual text doesn't begin until page 17. There are 22 pages of essentially nothing and only 41 pages of ""advice"" and ""information."" Sadly, most of that is in a large font with LOTS of white space...and almost entirely just common sense and ""filler."" Example: ""Amid the vast multitude of people we will have the pleasure or displeasure of dealing with, no two will be the same. Because we are all somewhat human, we are also unique...""In my opinion, this is NOT a book for professionals for use in interviews, interrogations and negotiations. I find VERY little substance here; almost no ""take-away"" at all."
1,Small scratch on non-verbal communication,"This flimsy booklet is only about 60 pages long, and the text doesn't begin until page 18! Additionally, the pages are small, and the text is large. There really isn't a lot to read. And the contents is really quite substandard. Most of the time the author gives some gestures and examples from which you can determine the attitude of the person you are communicating with. The problem is, you cannot take some separate gesture and use it to determine that the person you are comminicating with is hostile toward you, for example. It's comparable to stating that whenever a person is touching his nose, he is lying.This book is not entirely bad, however. If you don't know anything at all of non-verbal communication, this book can serve as an introduction to the subject. And if you are writing an essay about non-verbal communication, reading this book is an easy way to expand your reference..."
5,I loved it!,"I loved it! The book has drama, mystery, suspense and humor all wrapped up into this great story. I thought about how some of the characters reminded me of people I know, then it got scary because it reminded me of aspects of myself (I won't tell)! This was so ""real"" and it was great having the story's setting in a place where I am very familiar with. I eagerly anticipate the sequel. Thanks Janet for a great book, I'm telling all my friends."
5,Can't Keep Quiet,"It's hard to keep quiet about Quiet As It's Kept. This was a surprisingly good read for me. Not that I didn't expect it to be good, but I admit that I thought it would be far more ""deep"" and ""serious"" than it was. I questioned whether or not now was a good time for me to read it with me going through the tragic loss of one of my friends. I thought the storyline might be a bit depressing. But there were moments during this story of James Scott and his three (now adult) children that had me laughing out loud. There was some sadness too, but I still found it to be a fun, enjoyable, fast-paced read. This book reminds me of what my grandmother used to say. ""No man lives or dies to himself."" That meant the things that you did always affected the lives of others. Sometimes not until you die, but sooner or later all of the secrets come out. Great job, Janet West-Sellars. I look forward to you next book."
4,Very funny in parts,I enjoyed this book most around the half-way mark especially regarding Zipsers antics which were laugh-out-loud funny. Once Zipsers antics subsided the book became purely plot driven which was still enjoyable but it completely loses its comic sparkle in the second half.
2,"Cute, but not worth the price.","Looking at these, you'd think you can tighten the lace on the gloves for a better fit... but no. You definateely cannot. I am not a petite girl- quite average actually. These seem to be more for a plus sized person. Very cute, though. Good for drunken Halloween nights. :)"
5,"PEQUENO, CONCISO, EXCELENTE","esta pequena historia, que aun no se si calificar de novela por su brevedad, me deja pasamado al final. es un hombre que carga con un lastre espiritual a lo largo de su existencia, viajar siempre con su amigo retrasado hasta que un dia algo que el hace en su inocencia rompe con esas andanzas para siempre. siento que en esa muerte hay una especia de liberacion por parte de ambos. el nunca creyo que su amigo le haria dano y aquel aunque triste se vio liberado de el . es algo que nos pone a pensar, una cosa que a a steinbeck le gusta mucho, fascinar al lector y dejarlo con la incertidumbre en la ultima pagina... LUIS MENDEZ"
5,Bad Kitty,Very cool figure. Pays homage to the Ravage character from G1 transformers and has an interesting asthetic as well as just being fun to play with. Highly recommended!
5,great book,This book is very useful for anyone working with solar or human-powered vehicles. It is the only book of its kind for these types of prototype vehicles and is well worth the money. I'm working on a car for a supermileage competition and this book has been a big help.
1,For Win 3.1/95 system,"This information is not listed. It's a great game, but extremely old and will not run on most systems."
3,Strong coriander (cilantro) powder flavor,"I bought this recently from Wild Oats Markets in Tulsa. They were selling it at $3.99. It tasted OK, but I don't know if everyone would love the strong coriander/cilantro powder flavor. I love the taste of Cilantro leaves but I didn't like the flavor of its seeds (in powdered form) when that seemed to be the dominant flavor."
5,Love Tasty Bite but ...,"I've been buying Bombay Potatoes for years and enjoy the consistent quality. However, I will not be buying from Amazon any longer. I last purchased these on Amazon in November and paid $31.38 for 12 boxes INCLUDING shipping. Now the price is $53.32 with shippping??????????????? Amazon must be joking. You can buy them direct from Tasty Bite for much less than that. In fact, you can buy them from your local supermarket for less than you can from both of them."
5,"Flavorful, hearty and great for Weight Watchers!","One packet (one whole box) of Bombay Potatoes is 4 points on Weight Watchers. Often, for dinner I will supplement with fresh spinach, extra chick peas, or chicken sausage - this all makes for an extremely tasty, low point dinner or lunch that doesn't taste like diet food!Tasty Bites contain only ingredients that are instantly recognizable- ""whole"" foods. The potatoes in Bombay Potatoes have a great, soft yet firm texture, and the sauce is incredibly flavorful. I highly recommend."
4,HOT but tasty.,Definitely a quick and easy entree. Authentic (according to my experience) Indian cuisine. But too spicey hot for my taste.
5,Fantastic and Healthy,"I love many of the Tasty Bite products. This one is delicious, low fat, vegan and healthy."
5,Very helpful for teachers of young children!,"This book guides early childhood educators through the concept of implementing early childhood art into their classrooms. It is very helpful in showing teachers how to focus on the ""process"" not the ""product"". There are also many wonderful ideas for special needs children, and for adding multicultural art experiences into the classroom."
4,Easy to read!,I had to get Art & Creative Development for Young Children for a Early Childhood Class. It was easy and interesting book of knowledge.
2,The poet should leave the rading of his poetry to others,"I dearly love A Coney Island.., but the poet doesn't read it very well. And the music obviously was recorded at another time and place, and is really a pain in the neck. Read the poems alound all by yourself. It would be much better. Or let me read it to you. 50svinyl"
5,Great quality,It was very well made. The fit was great also. Would definitely recommend it. My daughter had a blast as a doctor for Halloween.
3,4 yr old daughter loves it!,It's a little big on her but that we did that on purpose so she will be able to use it for longer. The only reason for 3 stars instead of 4 is that the hat and mask are a bit small and prob won't fit long on any kid with a normal size head. Otherwise - it's great and goes perfect with the medical kit we bought her!
2,Material too thin,"I bought this for use on more than 1 or 2 occasions, more as a play outfit. It didn't seem as though the material would stand up to multiple uses."
1,where's the pink?,would really love to be able to see if my daughter loves these as well. it keeps advertising the pink in the search and then shows up only in blue with no way of choosing a color! what's up with that?!
4,Worth the money,Build a Smokehouse: Storey Country Wisdom Bulletin A-81 (A Storey Country Wisdom Bulletin)A skiny little book but if you want to build a smoke house it is a nice one to have. I wish i had it fourty years ago before i tried to build my first smoke house. It would have not have burned down if I had followed the advice in this little book.
4,Sage advise.,It is what it says it is. Basic instructions on building a smokehouse. They provide several types starting with simple to a permanent structure. It's a nice straight forward pamphlet.
3,Build a smokehouse,"Good book, but no novel, keeps things very basic and doesn't go into detail about parts that could improve finished product."
3,Nothing special,I could probably find all of this information with a simple Google search but it did give me an idea or two that I had not thought of on my own. This covered the basic mechanics of design and reasons to smoke things.
1,Very Basic.... not for anyone who has already smoked meats,"Basic design of the building of smoke houses. Does give detailed instructions on how to ""build"" a smoke house. Should have included functioning of a smokehouse. What is mising is the operation of a smokehouse - controlling smoke, temperature, fire, damper techniques."
2,Not worth it,Not worth the four bucks. Very little useful info in this pamplet. Look for something with more detail and better instructions.
5,Smoked meats ah!,Great book simple and accurate way to build a great smokehouse . It really simplified the process of smoking meats.
5,Can't wait to build one,Excellent reference for building a smokehouse. I can't wait until we get the chance to build one. Easy to read instructions.
5,easy,it was so easy to use this guide we are excited to get started using it so we can smoke our own meats
4,Great book.,"As described, the book is fairly detailed and has some drawings and pictures. It would have had 5 stars if there where some actual building schematics/plans with materials list."
4,Great source of ideas for building a smokehouse,"I enjoyed reading this book when I was researching various options for building a smoker/smokehouse. The authors provide clear descriptions both of the smoking process as well as multiple smoke house designs of increasing complexity. Their stile is no-nonsense and straight-forward, something I really appreciated."
3,Anti Vibration foot/shifter pegs.,"Product is not bad, although not exactly what is listed in the product description:"" High tech, chrome-plated FOOTPEGS enhanced comfort and appearance on any vehicle.Replaceable hollow rubber inserts provide vibration dampening and almost completely eliminate FOOTPEG tingle. "" This description leads you to believe that what you are ordering is the foot pegs. What you get is the shifter only."
4,not to rub it in...,"...but it is great. the second disk isn't quite as good as ""rock 'n' roll session, but still quite good and essentially ""2 disks for the price of one"" which is a very good thing when it comes to things on world serpent. if you don't have it however, ""sugarfishdrink"" is my favorite nww release. and in reference to the other person's comment, try e-mailing riouxs@aol.com and asking for a list of nww prices. tell 'em i sent ya!"
5,This disk is not available,"I thought that Amazion could provide me with a copy of this limited addition (1000) disc. They couldn't and took 3 months to let me know. Pity, it's supposed to be great. Try ""Rock n' Roll Station"" if you're curious."
2,No Hooks Provided,"I bought this canopy b/c my oldest daughter had one for her bed, and my youngest wanted one too. When it arrived..it gave instructions and pictures for how to hang it, but when I looked for the hooks to hang it on..surprise..there were none. Instead there are instructions to 'buy at your local hardware store', somewhat dissappointing. Find one that includes the hooks and hardware."
3,Coming home soon!,"As an African-IN-America, I am interested in Africana and I read what I can about the homeland. It is my dream to one day retire to Africa and travel to all the lands that nourished my ancestors- Egypt, Nubia, Ethiopia, Timbuktu....and all the magical names of our great cities and kingdoms.This book is good for the geography and as a general overview of the continent, but it seems more written for Anglo-Euro visitors. Still, it is filling me with ideas of the places I'll see and it is making me work all the harder to make my dream a reality.Africa- I'm coming home!"
3,It's just too much for one book,"I applaud LP for taking on the challenge of a book that covers the entire continent, but it's just too much for one book. I bought it in order to piece together an itinerary, but it doesn't do a good job in linking the countries together. Under the ""suggested itineraries"" it really just says it will depend on your money and time (uh, thanks, no kidding) and then tells you where NOT to go (Congo, Sierra Leone, etc)The newest version is at least clumps groups of countries together. Mine is just a year old and has the countries in alpha order.I would suggest buying the smaller books (LP East Africa, etc) instead."
1,Very disappointing book,"This is a very disappointing book.The countries are not really covered.One cannot have an overview of Africa by reading this book.Too many pages are unnecessarily spent on the standard features like visas,places to stay in the capitals,dangers,etc. Furthermore, mostly big towns are covered.There are no references to the indigenous cultures of each country,no indication of the comparative merits of each place within each country,and,above all,no comparison of the various countries--so one cannot decide which are the best countries to visit.Finally,most countries are presented in a positive light,as if each writer set out to compete with the rest,which does not help at all.Books of this sort,that cover many countries,must help the reader decide which countries are worth visiting and which are not,something that this book utterly fails to do--an excellent example of a book that succeeds in this,but from another part of the world,is Moon's ""South Pacific""."
2,Out of Date,"So out of date!! Several countries do not seem to have any presence on the ground. The email sources don't go anywhere, and Lonely Planet's web site has no further info. Much of the how-to comes from the U.S. State Department's web site."
4,great start to a trilogy,"great characters, great sex and an enjoyable escape from everyday reality....A great introduction into the Storm family and to meet some gorgeous men and women!"
3,Only a partial WiFi solution,"This works very well if all you want to do is connect to your already configured home network. It does not, however, include some common WiFi tools, such as the ability to pick an access point from a list, test signal strength, or use newer security features. It's hard to configure: you'll need to know (and enter exactly) the SSID of your access point. Good luck trying to use this with a public access point (paid or free). Unless you do so research before you go out (e.g., the common SSID used by Starbucks), you'll have no way of knowing how to connect.Also note that this is more expensive than other WiFi CF cards. However, this is your only option for Sony Clie devices."
1,Don't Bother - Mostly Filler Material,I thought the book would cover more about running an escort business. The first 36 pages covered that topic and the remaining pages of this 277 page book were just transcripts from his trials.He also looks down on the girls who work for him and comes off as a pimp who whines about having to keep his ho's in line all the time.There are better books out there...
5,"Griddle 11"" Faberware","If you like to grill pancakes,cheese sandwiches, etc, this is the grill to get. It is non stick, easy to handle and cleans easily by washing. It's low sides make turning the items fast and clean."
2,"Watchable, to say the least","My friend and I rented this movie at the last minute, hoping for something different. Well, it isn't different. A chick in love with two guys... wow, how original. I didn't care at all about the characters or the lame story. It is watchable and somewhat amusing, but that's about it."
1,"Wow, Now Here's an Important Movie!","Because gosh, you know what America needs? Sexual freedom. I mean, we really only THOUGHT we were liberated, sleeping with anything and everything that takes our fancy--but we weren't. What we NEED to do is to combine the promiscuous experiences, so we can collect venereal diseases and birth children of confused parentage even faster! Splendor shows us just what we're missing as it invites us to liberate ourselves from primitive notions like jealousy and knowing who the hell your father is. Don't let people judge you, man, as long as you're having fun, cos isn't that what it's all about? Me, I'm about promiscuous polyamory! Way to go, Splendor, lead the way!"
3,Not the the Perfect Threesome,The movie was average but when I received the tape it was suppose to be a new tape and I received a Promo instead. A bit distracting. I've seen many movies (foreign mostly) dealing with the topic that were better.
3,"Good, but not Araki's best...","I know that this movie is not in the same vein as The Doom Generation or Nowhere...but I like those alot better. Splendor was good, I just really didn't like Kathleen Robertson's character in this film. I mean, Gregg Araki definately has alot of talent...but I just didn't think it was as good as he could have made it. I wasn't expecting anything from the afore mentioned films. Don't get me wrong...I liked this movie, I was just hoping for something just a tad different. Oh well, it was still a damn good movie."
5,Loved it,"I really loved this movie. While I would never live the lifestyle these people do I really wanted their relationships to work out. The three of them look very good together and the moments, where they are getting along, are very sweet. I recommend this movie."
3,Better than many high-profile romantic comedies i 've seen,"Splendor , the story of confused ordinary girl Veronica who enloys living a life in a threesome is really a refreshing romantic film experience. Having been directed with a speedy Mtv-like aura by Greg Araki , the film achieves to be both funny and tender. It's hard not to love it's three lead-actors , especially with the killer-lines they get to say in certain moments of the film ( ""Who do you love?Him or us?"" ) .All the cast delivers some good acting but the one who , in my opinion shines is Matt Keeslar as the goofy yet appealing Zed , an ex-drummer who eventually becomes his basic rival's best friend in order to get to be with Veronica too."
4,I bought it and I love it!,"This moive might be compaired to threesome but really this is a much better moive. This moive is not afraid to offend anyone and gose for the gold in this very funny and at times sexy moive. I bought this moive about a mounth ago and I have not regreted it once, If you are a Kathleen Robertson fan you will love it and if you are not you will be."
5,The Way Thing Spozed to Be,It's a great book written by my former 7th grade Home Room teacher. He was a great teacher and I always meant to read it.
5,We had a great fun down there!,"Hello Friends! Now and then we had Woodstock , Isle of Whight< Monterey, etc! But in Brasil we had MUTANTES doing at the same time of those events a great rock and roll music , mixed with samba, bossa nova, jazz , latin and caribean music, Indian classical music ,etc ! So , we had a movement there that create as many powerful songs at the same time they were creating here and abroad(Zappa , Beatles , etc) , and forget about our dictatorship at the time ,our music nowadays is tacky and imbecile,(Democracy now) so they(Mutantes) remained fresh and sounding better than ever! I wish some groups of famed name here could play a little bit of this kind of music or at least learn how to play some instruments the way Os Mutantes employed them , Effects, sinthesizers,vocals,etc.Go out and get the records of them you can find and listen to them and enjoy it, one of the best music ever made in Brasil at all times! Viva Os Mutantes! Peace!"
1,Awful,"Transport yourself back to 1964 and wonder what it would have been like if a bunch of Brazilian high-school kids with absolutely no musical talent started imitating the Beatles. Got it? Now, don't waste your time and money listening to it."
3,I was hoping for more....,"I usually enjoy Elizabeth Boyle's books, but ONE NIGHT OF PASSION contains so many inconsistencies, coincidences, and unbelievable events that it detracts from the story. It's not just that the characters do not behave true to their time period, sometimes their actions make no sense at all. It seems to be too hurriedly written and not edited at all!"
3,camara kinda bites...,"good phone, alright reception (might just be the carrier, not sure) picture function could definately use a little help."
1,i.hate.this.phone.,"it works for almost exactly one year, but then it completely falls apart. i don't abuse it, yet it's still extremely unreliable, not to mention obnoxious.the camera quality is poor, it randomly turns itself on and off.i actually feel bitter toward this phone when i have to use it, haha.my brother and i each got this phone at roughly the same time, and both our phones died almost exactly a year later...within 2 weeks of each other"
1,Unreliable Phone - Poor Customer Service,"The first 10 months I had this phone, it was great. Then one day the software just looked up. The local repair center sent it in to Audiovox for repair and it came back unrepairable due to physical damage??? What, this phone was never dropped or abused in any way...and it was a software issue....Customer service was clueless when I called in. They told me they know nothing about technical issues, even though I called into the warranty center, and that I was not allowed to speak to a technician. VERY POOR SERVICE for a VERY POOR PHONE!!! DONT BUY THIS PHONE!"
5,Awesome phone! And here's a link for the product manual.,"K. E. Espejo asked to buy a product manual from someone; here's a link for the CDM89000's 'homepage' and there is a link there that takes you to the manual in PDF format:[...]I've had this phone for just about a year and I LOVE it! The earpiece volume is LOUD, it maintains a signal in some tough terrain (Western PA), and it is pretty sturdy, having survived several drops.Two gripes: The speakerphone could be louder, but works wonderfully in most situations. And the camera, well, the product is first and foremost a phone, so really, enough said, eh?I would definitely recommend this phone."
1,Not very good at all...,"At the time (almost 2 years ago) this phone seemed like it had alot of good features, but the bad far outweighs the good. The camera and screen are next to worthless, you can never make out the pictures, calls are often dropped, verizon has disabled many features - like they do with all of their phones. Counting the days until my contract ends..."
4,Very nice middle to a trilogy,"I thought this book was actually better than the first. The motivations were much more believable and the characters more interesting. Arvin was more fleshed out, and the secondary characters were nicely done as well.There are also many more points in the book that are truly ""gripping"". You HAVE to see what happens during blah, blah, blah.I enjoyed the first book, but enjoyed the second one much more."
3,Not great,"The first one is better and hopefully so will the third. It kept my interest just enough for me to try the third. But the action wasn't too good and the overall feel of the story left me wanting. There are better books out there.If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it."
2,Too bad.,"The first book in this series was decent. The second one? It started out all right, but had a clumsily contrived ending: It seemed as if Ms. Smedman had to finish the book hastily in a way intended to make readers feel sorry for the hero."
3,what time is it?,It seems easy to program but I did have a problem getting it to give time correctly over 24 hours. it is compact and fairly attractive. It is very small and sometimes hard to find in the dark to check the time by pushing the light dial. It is relatively inexpensive. I don't know how it will perform over time but so far it seems to keep time well.
4,Does what I need.,"I bought this clock to put in the bathroom to see the time while showering. I was concerned at first because it is not back-lit unless you have just touched it. I found that even though it is not back-lit, I can still see it just fine."
1,AWFUL,"THIS CLOCK NEVER WORKED AT ALL. I GUESS YOU REALLY DO GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR...SPEND A FEW MORE DOLLARS, GET A BETTER CLOCK!!"
1,Eats new batteries in 24 hours,"When I received the clock I put 2 new batteries in. The next day the clock was dead. I thought maybe I had some bad batteries, so I installed 2 new known good batteries. The next day the clock was dead. Not sure what is going on but it is useless. Probably shorted inside or something. I would not recommend."
3,Didn't last very long,"It was fine for about a year. Now the numbers are all losing bits of themselves so as to be unreadable. I don't like creating more plastic junk to send to the landfill, but that's where this product ends up all too soon."
3,Just fine. Great for the price,I needed a clock that didn't make a loud ticking noise so I purchased this one. I have not tried to set the alarm or the nap alarm yet. I liked the idea of the automatic 15 minute blocks for the nap timer and that was one of the reasons i got this clock . When you click on the light to see the time in a dark room it seems a bit loud. That is my only complaint.
1,Poor Alarm Clock,"This alarm clock was purchased so that I could bring it with me when I traveled and not have to worry about missing an appointment. To start off I liked it. It has a quiet alarm, I am very light sleeper so it worked for me. But after a few times using it the alarm didn't go off. I checked several times to see if I was wrong, but sure enough, it never went off when I set the alarm. Then I would be flying or driving somewhere and the alarm would randomly start going off, I checked to see if I miss set the alarm or had it on nap or something, but I didn't.So there you have it...Do not buy this alarm clock. 1. It is extremely quiet 2. It stopped working after a few months."
2,Battery Alarm Clock,This battery alarm clock is very cute. If you are looking for a LOUD alarm then do not buy this clock. I have put this clock away as it does not wake me due to it being so quiet. It does take a loud alarm to wake me.
2,Picture of clock is misleading!,The picture associated with the item is misleading. That blue light only turns on for a few seconds then shuts off. Without out it to see the time is extremely difficult! If you are using it for alarm purposes I guess that's okay. However (as in my case) I bought it for my parents because they wanted a clock for their living room and they can barely see it. I was skeptical till I saw it and definitely it is almost impossible to read. If there was a switch to keep the blue light on all the time this would be a tremendous clock and value. However by auto shutting off the light you are better off with a plug in clock which costs slightly more....
4,Rating the Elgin battery operated clock,The Elgin Battery Powered LCD Alarm clock is a winner - both from the point of view of performance and cost. The only negative aspect about it is that it GAINS time -but that's better than losing it!
3,"Does the job, but some flaws","It does the job, but there are a few things that bother me about this clock. 1) When you hit the button for the backlight it beeps fairly loudly. 2) Because of the back slant to the clock, I can't see the angle unless I'm above it, so it's hard to see the time when I'm lying in bed.Having said that, it's the only clock I've found that is NOT atomic that has a nap feature and I do like the nap feature."
2,False Advertising by Amazon.com,"I bought this clock for the sole purpose of being able to display a 24-hour time as Amazon.com advertised. This is not an option on the clock, and neither the packaging nor manual mention anything of it. It is only a 12-hour (AM/PM) style clock. Aside from this blatant false advertising, the clock does have a sleek and compact design. I wish I had a purpose for a 12-hour clock, or that I could return it, but I've (very unsuccessfully) tried a return on a falsely-advertised CD and it wasn't worth the time spent."
1,disappointed by Timex,"I've had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light. So I was happy to find this one. However, with my first ""Eagle"" the alarm didn't go off. Amazon was great about the exchange for a new one (kudos). My repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight won't light up and I have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on. I second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle. The loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning, but I put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough."
2,"Too loud, difficult to read","I love the concept of a nap timer, but when the nap's over look out...you'll be blasted awake. As another reviewer mentioned, the clock is difficult to read at some angles (in particular, from exactly the angle you are at when lying down looking at the clock on the nightstand!). And the snooze is difficult to press."
2,arrived broken,"It's still usable for the purpose I bought it for - for waking up a 7 year old for school. But it is disappointing that it arrived broken, the light for seeing the clock at night does not work, and the 'increase time' button for setting the time or alarm does not work, so I always have to set everything from the 'decrease time' button. My mother sent it to me over-seas so it's a real hassle to try to return it, so it will do for now. At least my child has a clock to wake him up for school. In a few years I will order him a better one."
3,basically good,"It takes up very little space, basically does everything it advertises but when you want to see the time at night, you have to tilt it forward in order to read the time."
2,Can't view display,"This is a simple inexpensive digital clock but it has one significant drawback: you can only see the display clearly at a tilted angle, otherwise the numbers fade. The time/date/alarm settings are pretty easy to sort out and there is 24 hour clock possible - all good. The fahrenheit/centrigrade switch has yet to be found, but that's OK for us as we live overseas. If I were the returning type, I would definitely have done this, but since it was a gift, the chance has passed. We have to look for another one with a better display."
4,Fun little clock,I wanted a clock that had the 24-hour clock to remind me of my time in Europe. This one includes date and temp. also. The backlight is only on when you push the button to turn it on. Then it is only on a couple seconds. Does everything I asked.
4,It's a nice clock but...,"This is a very nice clock, i didn't know it had the full calendar and the tmperature function built into it.. but, there is one thing about it that irks me. the way the LCD screen is angled you must either be right in front of it or above it. This is okay in most instances but in the instance of using it as a clock for the bathroom this is a pain in the butt, sitting on the toilet clock is right over your head, you turn your head around to check the time and YOU CANT!!!aside from the odd screen position it seems like a nice clock."
2,Display bad,Readout isn't working properly. Parts of it do not display. Doesn't work right. Display is not right. Readout is wrong.
2,Not Made in USA,"I was specifically buying this product because it showed up on a search for ""Made in USA"". After receiving it, I find out it's been made in China."
2,Not great quality,The switch for the alarm set sticks so you must check it carefully or you will be late in the morning.
1,Difficult to read the numbers,"To be fair, I bought this for my mother who lives in a different state. She liked the look of the clock, but found the dial very hard to read and gave it away. I do not recommend it."
1,Skate Company is rated lowest by BBB,This company was terrible. They sent skates that were completely different than pictured. I could never reach them by phone. No one answered several times. I called Amazon re the problem and then the company called me. I looked at the BBB rating of the company and it was lowest a company can be graded. I did tell Amazon about the rating.
4,Fun not funny,"listen A.M Roman if that is your real screen name, I don't think you should have wrote a huge thing if you disliked the game gosh get a life.Anyway this game rocks and you can unlock some awsome dudes, ok there are some wierd things, like bubba looks like a geek, and there are some pretty small places,and you do have to unlock bradshaw.BUT this game rocks! Everyone else basically likes jeff hardy but matts the better brother, he did'nt leave wwe for tna and come out to boy band music. Anyway most of my friends also like undertaker and i'll admit he looks cool in this game.Thats it."
4,She loves it!,It's amazing just how much difference a slightly bigger monitor makes! Sure helps with fatigue from staring @ the screen for hours when everything is just a bit larger & easier to see!
2,Where the !@*# is my rebate????,"It's been over 13 weeks! Nobody has an answer except to say they haven't received their money, and they have to receive theirs before I get my rebate!!!Looks like Sun is buying PIXO.Last time I buy PIXO!!!Without the rebate, it's a ripoff!!!"
3,Check Out the Speakers,"I ordered the monitor and received it quickly. Set up was a snap. The monitor looks nice and works well with the exception of the speakers. At what appears to be full volume, which is difficult to tell with the lack of a user's guide, it is not very loud at all. It almost is a whisper, not bad if you want to play a music CD in your cubicle, but more troublesome if you want to participate in a web-based seminar. I have requested a replacement, so will hold out final opinion until another monitor arrives."
4,Good Monitor worth $200+,"No dead pixel, bright screen. Blurs a bit in 1024x768 mode, but clear in 1280 x 1024 mode. It's worth $200"
3,Pixo Corion C700 White,"The price was right! Nice Monitor, but has about 10 bad pixels. Should have better quality control at the factory, or at least a notice that they are sub-quality. Performs well other than the dead pixels."
4,Love it,"After reading the reviews from other purchaser of this monitor, i was skeptical about it, then i priced others and that is what decided it for me...i am very pleased with this, granted the speakers leave alot to be desired but i wasn't getting this for the speakers anyway. For the price i am pleased with the brightness, and no dead pixels on mine.....and it takes up alot less space than the old kind. If you are looking for speakers...go buy speakers, if you are looking for a good quality flat screen monitor at a good price then you have found it."
1,"Don't bother with it, unless you like dead pixels","Got the first one. Looked fine, but with poor quality speakers and 3 dead pixels. Ordered a replacement from Amazon, and promptly got the replacement yesterday. This one has one dead pixel. Looks like very poor quality control. I must commend Amazon for prompt replacement.Two out of two are bad, so I am returning both of them and looking for a different manufacturer. If you do get one with no dead pixels, how long before one dies? These cheap monitors must be from a rejected lot. My recommendation : DON'T BUY IT!"
3,"So, what was it like on that ark with all those animals?","Life must have been tough on a boat of 500 X 30 cubits carrying Noah's family and two of every species. Author Geraldine McCaughrean mentions the smell, noise and dung but goes light on the how the people and animals were fed, how the lions and other predators were caged and the host of sanitation issues. She focuses, instead on Noah's family dynamics.Noah is a self-righteous patriarch, rivaled in his sense of entitlement by his son, Shem. Noah tells the family that the whole world is wicked and they have been chosen to survive because they are righteous. The primary narrator, Timna, as Noah's only daughter (unmarried) is their virtual slave. Her brothers are married, one to a bride captured on the recommendation of a sister-in-law.While it's in book format, it's really a short story. This is billed as being for children, but the content is a bit raw. It is not for fundamentalists or Biblical literalists either."
4,PICK THIS ONE UP!,"After I picked up EDL's ""Moment of Clarity"" without knowing what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of production and power packed versatility offered throughout the 13 tracks. If you're a fan of bands like DIAL 7, Rage Against the Machine, or even the Deftones, this disk is for you! My favorite song is their cover of the decade old hip hop group BLACK SHEEP's hit single ""The Choice is Yours"" It's flowin! ""Moment of Clarity"" really defines the peak of EDLs musical growth over the past few years...Pick this one up!!!!"
3,raw and yet their most refined album yet.,"edl have been around for a while. they were doing ""rap core"" before fred durst and his millions of minions could even spell the term. this is by far their most well produced album and i salute them for that. they have a definite hardcore appeal to them and they throw in just enough hip hop and rock to make it interesting. tim cook is an intriguing vocalist and he is quite talented at switching from rap to rage to a little melody when he wants to. they have a positive message too and that is kinda hard to fine now a days. all in all it's a good cd."
4,Hard-core Hip-hop,"I have only listened to the sound clips on the net and I've heard one song that this band does on my sattellite channel, but from what I hear so far, I like. I liked it so much that I wrote down the Label's name, the cd name, the artist, and the name of the song right away. I will definitely look for these guys to be up and coming stars of the new millenium, hopefully even sooner than that. Well, there's my two cents, take it or leave it. By the way, if the band reads this, you got fans in Texas man, stand proud, the words gettin' around yo'."
5,OLA ONABULE MORE SOUL THAN SENSE,"THIS ALBUM IS UNSURPASSED. THE AMALGAM OF UPTEMPO SOUL/JAZZ/FUNK IS UNBELIEVABLE. THE QUALITY AND RANGE OF THE ARTIST'S VOCALS ARE INCREDIBLE. IF YOU LIKE MUSIC OF THE STATED GENRE, BUY IT RIGHT NOW.IF YOU DONT LIKE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC YOU WILL BECOME A CONVERT. ABSOLUTELY STUNNING."
1,Missing pages made this book a poor buy,"The book we purchase was not in good shape, with many pages missing in the answers section. I would be reluctant to purchase a used book from this seller again."
1,"Lots of Info, VERY Confusing","As a high school student who enjoys math, my class only used the book for the exercises; the examples are awful and make math a bore. Do not purchase this book if you are a home schooler/ plan to spend most of math class tutoring yourself."
3,nice condition.,"great deal,but wished you guys could mail books to Puerto Rico,we are part of the U.S."
3,"Good recorder, horrible software","The recorder is easy to use and the microphone is very sensitive -- at a recent interview I was conducting, it picked up the voices of people talking in the hallway outside the closed door of the interview room. Trouble is, I cannot figure out the software, and I am not a techno-idiot. I don't care about using the software for voice recognition (since I interview many people, that wouldn't be practical), but I can't even figure out how to get the files off the device and onto my hard drive. There are five files on the recorder and they don't even show up in the voice editing software window. I'd assumed when I got the recorder that it would be drag and drop, but it isn't.I have just ordered a Sony recorder that IS drag and drop and that needs no proprietary software. I'm going to leave the Panasonic in my car to use for voice memos that I don't need to save to my computer."
1,software hassles mean I'll never buy a Panasonic product again,"My experience exactly mirrors that of one of the other reviewers of this product. I lost the software for this recorder in a move, and cannot find any information on how to obtain new software on the Panasonic Web site. It is bad enough that I would have to buy it (On HPs site, for example, you can conveniently download the software for their electronic products for free), but I can't even find any information on how to buy it. The recorder I bought for $100 is now virtually useless to me. Never again."
2,Looks good but poor quality,"Bought this watch as a gift for my niece for her birthday. Unfortunately my sister-in-law has had to call to send it back three times. That is, three separate watches were sent and all were failing. The watch itself looks gorgeous but in my view not worth the money if you have to go through three different ones to get a good one (who knows how long this one will last!). also, very embarrasing to give a gift that requires the recipient to follow up in order to get it to work."
3,Knit Cap,"Not the nicest best quality knit cap I've ever seen, but it's alright. It's nice looking but it's pretty plain, the blue isn't truly the ""giants"" blue and not just that, in 2 days of owning the cap, it already looks 2 years old! But over all, it's alright. As for the company, they did deliver promptly."
2,Not as nice as coated sand dollar,"My wife was somewhat disappointed by these ""sand dollar"" earrings. They looked like they had a lot of gold plate that hid the sand dollar imagery. Maybe they weren't real sand dollars like we expected from our experience in Cocoa Beach, FL."
5,"Works great, my son and husband use it a lot",My son is 9 and he pitches in baseball. He is throwing a 43 speed and it seems accurate. My husband enjoys it too! Everything was shipped very speedy and in time for Christmas! Would definitely buy from them again!
4,"Fun game, great looking, original gameplay twists","This is the best-looking (and sounding) game I know of for Mac, and the wallwalking etc. make it a great change from generic repetitive shooters like Doom. It's still just a shooter, with a linear plot, but it's the best of the genre you can get today. Multiplayer is fun too if you can find opponents. I wish there were more of it--hopefully Prey 2 will come to Mac as well."
2,Tecbnical problems take the fun out,"I am using Aspyr'sPrey with a MacPro and OS 10.5.2. Unfortunately, the game is unresponsive to keyboard commands which pretty much makes the game useless as soon as you progress a level or two. Their technical support has been disappointing. I don't know if they have had other reports of this nature or whether the problem is limited to just my computer or computers of my type."
3,Pretty Lame,"No reflection on the seller, who shipped the game quickly. Despite some nifty graphics, the game concept itself is pretty silly. I appreciate that it was created in 2006 and FPS games have advanced a long way since then. Kudos, though, for the programmers giving a nod to the Native Americans...the lead character is good at putting a hurt on the aliens."
1,newspaper would work,They didn't stay in place very well. I think I could have done fine with newspaper instead of these.
3,Rim Protectors,"They are pretty thick, should work fine on alloy rims. Didn't use them on the steel rims."
2,These and similar nylon rim protetors,"I didn't buy these on Amazon but have tried these in the past and had limited use from them. Like other's they failed on the second rim I used with it. I have gone back to using old inner-tubes (thick). One benefit of the old inner-tube, is its easy to move around the rim and there's a lot of it."
4,Make sure to use your soap..,"These were helpful in keeping my tie irons off my rims, but much of the scratching the rims do get is attributable to not quite having had the knack the first few times. The rubber seems to be pretty durable though after two or three changes of a rear 17/190 motorcycle tire the rubber has already cut through in places."
1,disappointed,this book is a coppy of every health book out there !!! dont waist your money !! to the author get a job !!! a real job ! and stop wrtting books ! dont buy it !!
3,Nice Touch,For those of us who have not yet sold our souls to a Blackberry or iPhone this dresses up my six year old PDA about as well as it can be.
5,Now this is just weird,"Who knew John Bellairs had a sense of humor? All right, his humor shines through in his many quirky spinechillers, but I had no idea he had written something like this.""The Pedant and the Shuffly"" is a cool enough title on its own, but it frames a very unusual and witty short fantasy. The premise is simple: Snodrog (don't laugh) an evil magician, uses cold logic to entrap and transform his victims into Flimsies (don't laugh). But soon, Wodehousian-named Sir Bertram Crabtree-Gore, a good magician, teams up with a Shuffly (don't laugh), and Snodrog soon has a worthy opponent(s)...Bellairs' starkly descriptive prose is as good in this book as it is in his famed chillers and ""Face in the Frost."" Though this book is unusually short (about half the regular for his books) and relatively simple in plot, it is laced with witty satire in logic and Latin.Kids will enjoy the cute plot. Adults will enjoy the witty undertones. Both will enjoy ""Pedant and the Shuffly""!"
4,old school smooth,"as a veteran of old school soul music, this group takes me back to when we bobbed our heads, swayed side to side and finger popped. They're definitely ""on time""."
3,"Ugly, but interesting reading.","99% of the European structures in this book are as ugly as sin. If it where not for some of the interesting reading I would have only given this book only 2 stars. Being a European book it does give us a look at some technology that is not being used here in North America, and that quite frankly is all I liked about this book."
3,You have to enlarge the patterns,"I thought the patterns came with it, and the book was on techniques for the manufacturing. But you have to enlarge the patterns yourself. Other than that, its a good book if you have the time."
5,A great value,"As the previous reviewer noted, you get a lot of coloring for the money with this book. I ordered 3 other coloring books in the same order, and this one had more than 10 times the pages for less money than one other book I received. I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old, who is just getting into coloring, and I think the images are a little complex for this age. But any child who loves Thomas will love this book."
4,Great coloring book!,"This book has a lot to color. I especially love the alphabet train pictures. Beware though when you see the word ""Jumbo"". I was expecting a very large book but it is only a regular sized coloring book with lots of pages. Fun, none the less!"
5,its a good coloring book,"it a coloring book, it lets the kids color on it so i guess its doing it job, lol"
5,very funny,I have not heard it but I gave it to friends for Christmas and they think it is very very funny. I first saw it recommended on a TV morning show.
5,Fantastic Book,"Jerry Bridges' book is the book that you want to hand to new believers. He does a great job of explaining the Christian life, as God designed it to work. However, the book is a must read for all growing Christians as well. I have encouraged everyone in our church to read it, and we have about 4 copies going around. If I could only read one book this year, besides the Bible, I would pick this one. It will encourage you to holiness."
4,"Ace Of Base-Better than Never Before....So Far So Good...,","Ace Of Base is becoming better & better ...,You won't find yourself listening to music that seems like already heard before played by the same band.With most bands surviving on past succcesses (one feels one is done with such bands very soon...,it's only the first album that's worth listening),here's one that has come to stay..., An album that makes you wish they released one album (atleast)every month....,"
3,Pretty OK,"They are not as well made as I thought they would be and the tonality is rather dull, but they are still fun and my kid dig's them. I added a soem holes on each end and suspended the holder in the air... built a 2 x 4 frame and it increased the quality of the vibrations, but overall I would think a better plastic might be used or something to make them sound better."
1,to expensive for what it is,"it dosent have a good quality, they dosent sound as you imagine they will, my son that is 3 use them for other things but not to play music. I wanted to returned it but BROOK MAYS amazon market place, want to charge me the cost of the shipping when they sent it, and the return shipping, so pretty bad service from that store too."
3,Disappointing,"Just a warning, these tubes are thin plastic not metal. The sound quality is much like hitting a paper towel tube, not like a xylophone. I am a little disappointed but probably won't go to the trouble of returning it since the toy is for my two year old. I wish it had said somewhere in the description that these tubes were made of plastic."
5,Timken Bearing and Hub,"When purchasing on-line I often wonder if the products are as described, if they are merely cheap imitations, or even if they are counterfeit. In this case, I found the product exactly as described, and apparently true to its name. The installation was a snap, and the ABS sensor worked fine and cleared up a dash light that had been on a couple of months. I was a bit confused because the product DID fit my 1993 Buick, but several manufacturer sites did not include this model number in the list of compatible hub assemblies. The Timken site listed it and it was, in fact, compatible."
4,"Protects your organiser from much, but not everything","First the plusses:1. Prevents your organiser from being accidentally switched on. (Some cases leave the on/off key exposed.)2. There's a little pocket inside which can take a small mobile phone too, if you're happy with the resulting bulge. (I keep my Sony T68i in there.)3. There's a belt attachment and loop on the reverse of the case.And the minuses:4. You have to remove your organiser from the case to use it.5. Though the case is tough, there isn't a rigid plate inside to protect your PDA screen from cracks due to crush and point impacts. If your PDA came with a clip-on screen protector, you'll be advised to keep it clipped on inside the case.I have to admit that I don't own a Clie. I use the case for my Palm Tungsten T2, which fits nicely inside. Oh well, it's the same OS ..."
3,The book is fine just not great,"Having read many books by various authors on natural horsemanship, I had hoped to find a real gem again with Gawani Pony Boy. There is certainly useful information in it, however it is not a great read and his need to emphasize the way of the Native Americans comes across as forced and not sparkling, which is what I had hoped for."
4,liked it,"I bought this book for my ten-year old great niece who lives in the big middle of a large city, but is really interested in horses. I thought the combination of horse and Indian philosophy. I live two states away in the middle of nowhere, (by choice), with my horses, so I was glad to find this book. So much of the non-fiction literature is about ""showing"" which I find to be growingly offensive to the horse/human relationship. Only a few questionable statements in here., such as a warrior sometimes would bring his war ponies into the teepee, forcing the women and children out. The teepee belongs to the wife, and she can ""divorce"" him by putting this moccasins outside, so I doubt she would ever let herself be placed out with the horse inside..not to mention the difficulty of getting a horse into a teepee. But other than that, I really enjoyed the book."
2,"**Shrugs shoulders and says, ""Eh?""","Just so-so. Wouldn't have purchased, especially for this price, in person. But well made. Maybe I just don't get it. I saw ""temple bells"" and thought the noise would take me back to yoga class, keep that yoga high all day. Nope."
4,Looking for good Trance?,"This Latest Album for Taylor is definitely worth picking up. If you are a fan of Electronica, you know good Trance is hard to find. ""Synaesthesia"" is full of energy and attractive phat beats from beginning to end. I highly recommend the dual cd set ""Synaesthesia"" if you're a fan of Taylor or Trance."
2,highly overrated,I tried liking this compilation. It is just plain boring with bland and cheesy songs. please do not purchase. ther are much much better mixes out on the market. avoid at all costs.
2,Tedious and Murky look at the Byzantium,"Apparently, retired Oxford Professor, Cyril Mango is extremely well respected in his field so I was surprised when I read the first chapter of this book for a humanities class and found it tedious and inaccessible. Perhaps the rest of the book is written in a more eludite style, but chapter one was a blindingly ""rapid tour"" of Byzantium in 586 AD (Mango never explained the significance of the date) that is little more than an inventory of the regional tribenames and their languages. I have a passion for history, but found chapter one a total bore. I couldn't help but think of people who dislike history because it's ""just a bunch of names and dates."" Mango certainly managed to reduce a fascinating period to nothing more than a list."
4,Accepatble condition!,"Sent at media rate, so it was receeived in a week or so. It is a little used, but that is what I expected. Good price! Still works!"
2,Boring!!!,"Like everything written by Chilton, this book is really boring. The author's obsession with discography makes this book an enumeration of who played which tune where and when. Bechet deserves a better biography! Collier, help us!"
1,Don't bother,"I was looking for an inexpensive but fairly comprehensive Lithuanian-English English-Lithuanian dictionary. This isn't it. Although the dictionary claims to have 8000 terms in each language, many common English words, like ""contrast"" for example, aren't in here. The word ""reveal"" is listed only as a noun, no reference to the verb. Also there was apparently no attempt to have all of the Lithuanian terms which are given in the English section, listed in the Lithuanian section. Consequently the Lithuanian word ""atrasti"", given as a term for ""reveal"" (noun) is not listed in the Lithuanian section. There is a pronunciation guide at the beginning of the book which is helpful, especially because Lithuanian appears to me to be a pretty phonetic language, unlike English. There are no phrases, no grammar. Don't bother with this one."
1,There are much better dictionaries,"I learned to speak Lithuanian in Lithuania and found this dictionary to be entirely disappointing. While the compact size is nice, there are infinitely better Lithuanian dictionaries available. There are a lot of mistranslations and some of the pronunciation keys are out in leftfield. This isn't a higher form of Lithuanian, just an out-moded form. The Bronius Piesarskas/Bronius Svecevicius is a much better distionary."
2,Not recommened unless you speak Lithuanian,"This book is alright, but the Lithuanian pronounciations are NOT in the English section. For example: Sun (suhn) saule n You'd have to do a reverse search for the word."
1,unsatisfactory,Blatant errors are to be found even in the 'Guide to Pronunciation' at the begininning of this volume. No extended explanations or examples of different usages. Very basic.
1,Translations not consistent,"I used this dictionary to try to have a conversation with native Lithuanians. It was very difficult. The translations are not consistent and sometimes just wrong. Looking up the word for ""sick"" in english actually gave me the word for ""tired"". However, the LT to EN translation for ""tired"" gave me the english word for ""tired"". It is helpful, but not something I would exclusively use for travel."
2,Keep your hands off the Kerouac,"The stuff that is in it's original form (or at least close to it) is great. ""Ain't We Got Fun"", ""Come Rain or Come Shine"", and especially the reading from On the Road all sound great. This could have actually been a decent 40-minute CD. But why screw around with Jack's work? The pieces with newly recorded backing tracks are awful, they remind me of the Sinatra ""Duets"" stuff where there was no connection between Sinatra and his collaborators. It's like Ted Turner colorizing old classics. And I love Tom Waits, but what is he doing on this collection? Unfortunately, a lame concept. Get the Rykodisc boxset, it's the real deal."
4,Not quite what I had hoped for.,"This book was typical of the many caricature instruction books I have seen over the years. The 'basic' section was nothing new to me. I learned that years ago. The rest of the book highlighted the author's caricature skills, but failed to give much 'instruction' that could be used by a beginner or even someone like me trying to improve my skills.I really liked the book from an entertainment viewpoint. It is a great book to document the authors success, but doesn't help me with mine."
2,Needs a proof read,"Firstly, it's not Biljani - it's Bijlani. I bought this book hoping to get some quick background before flying to India on a business trip. I am disappointed. Yes, it has information that will help, but it has GLARING mistakes & typos.Two examples:1) In the map of India, the names of the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are interchanged. Believe me - it's like labeling California as Texas and Texas as California.2) The description of Indian flag is incorrect. Indian flag does NOT have the sanskrit words ""Truth alone triumphs"".This book does help. It would help a lot more if it went through a proof reading."
3,to the point,"the book is very usefull to those intresting in the indian economy and market,but a little dry and dull"
4,game review,"I do like this DVD--remember the ORIGINAL one; could NOT STOP PLAYING IT!!!! This also can get to be ""addictive"", if a person is not careful. Would recommend it."
4,Missle command,"really nice graphics, easy to play. Three turrets instead of one. More than I was expecting. I guess I was hoping for the old retro type black & white screen & missle tracks. This game is much nicer and for the price, you can't beat it."
3,A Great $500 Robot. Too Bad it's $1500.,"Easily the most sophisticated of the 4 robot vaccum cleaners on the market. We've tried 3. The self docking function is great. Roomba promises on this front but rarely delivers. The self-cleaning is fantastic. But overall it does not clean any better than the Roomba -- in fact it's less powerful. Hard to believe given the price difference.A well-engineered robot with a lot of great features. But at this price point it is somewhat disappointing. It's 25% better. Not 300% better.4 Stars for the Product. Minus 1 for performance/value.Not to all first time robot buyers -- these products are fairly tempermental. I never buy exntended warranties but with moving/cleaning/robot products, it's a wise invesment. That holds true for Roomba's or this product."
1,Piece of plastic junk!,"I earned one of these cameras after obtaining points in a survey site. It is made from cheap chrome color plastic and they do not supply the batteries. I had to use my own AAA batteries which kept popping out because of the bad springs in the camera. I would not be afraid to bet that is just another Chinese slave labor item.Plus if the batteries die or you remove them, you lose images. It does not take memory cards! I went to check out their website, which is very lame, and I could not find anyone to write to you about it. I am returning this camera! Stay away!"
5,amazing,arrived on time. this was just as decribbed. actually better. it was wrapped. i recomend this to people of anime otaku status
1,Do not buy this cheap tube squeezer,"I've had this tube squeezer for 3 months, and I used it about 10 times. It is pretty wimpy, but it worked OK. The pin fell out yesterday when I tried to use it on a 1.6 oz tube. It's pretty worthless. It's doesn't deserve even 1 Star."
3,Great for small tubes....,"I purchased this product for my large oil paint tubes (6.75 fl oz). It doesn't work. It will work for the little tiny tubes (1.4 fl oz), but not the large. It still comes in handy though.I'm sure it would work for large tubes of toothpaste since toothpaste is a lot softer than paint.If anyone knows where I can get a metal tube sqeezer for large paint tubes (6.75 fl oz or larger), please leave a comment on this post and let me know. Thanks much.UPDATE: I did buy a large metal one at [...] and it's fantastic for the large tubes. Thanks everyone for putting me on the right path to find this."
2,"Great graphic, Good gameplay horrible controls.","In the end the effort put into this game falls apart do to the horrible controls. They idea behind them seem to be to duplicate the controls of the original console versions. However, in then the controls become anti-intuitive making it difficult to truely enjoy the game.The stlye of the graphics are in the same vain as those of the console versions, and do a good job of giving you a nice feel. However its all ruined by shady controls."
4,For a Starter Only,"This is a nice, concise, but hardly comprehensive 'best of"" collection. If you are already a fan it seems rather pointless. If you aren't, the price makes this a pretty no risk introduction to this superb artist. Buy it, but be aware that it is only a blip on the radar for this excellent songwriter."
5,Country Gold--pure gold listening!,"I was looking for something different to listen to at work and found this to fill the bill.I have enjoyed Nanci G. for a very long time and had not heard this collection before. I liked it so much, I borrowed it, took it home, recorded on cassette to play in my 9+ yr old Integra. Singing in traffic!! Another Austin pass time!"
1,Not what I ordered.,The item I received was a low quality generic power cable that was 18 AWG not 16 AWG (It didn't even properly state it on the cable either). The cable was also much shorter (4 or 5 feet). I recommend if you are looking to get an actual Cables To Go branded cable (and one at the proper gauge) to look elsewhere.
3,"Nice, but not a good color reference","I won't disagree with the previous three reviewers except to note that this makes a poor painting guide if you're looking for a wargaming reference. Very few color plates, so it's primary use is for style and equipment rather than color schemes. For $12, however, not a bad reference."
3,Not a diffinative source,"I am a Historian, wargamer/modeler, and civil war reenactor I like to have good referance material around. For the price and size of the book more, one should expect more. There are not a lot of color sources in this one, and desciptions its like getting shot at with buck and ball sometimes its dead on and rich, other time its just gets peppered vague and lacking. Also very little is in the back bibliography so using there sources is difficult at best. Another thing I feel that is worth noting is that the author are not Americans and there always seems to be a detached understanding of the conflict in general from non-American author on the civil war.The bright points are there is some interesting info on how some state uniformed their men and manufactured such clothing, but by no means complete. If you find it for less than 20$ get it if not move on."
3,Ok Book on Uniforms,"As far as detailed information goes, there isn't much here I didn't already have in Arms & Equipment of the Civil War by Coggins. There are a lot of photos, but they are mostly black & white historic shots. There are a few nice color illustrations, could be a lot more. And a few shots showing groups of accessories, which could be identified better. Not an exhaustive research reference, but ok for basic understanding."
3,the human body Skeletal system,"This was a little bit more ""basic than what I would have liked. Good as an introductory video for those that are just beginning in anatomy"
4,Entertaining and Enlightening,"A particularly special essay in this collection is Fisher's perspective on why she chose to live where she does. As with her choice of food and associates, Fisher demonstrates that where/how/why we call home is a decision which also demands a state of mindfulness and purpose. In the chapter, she also describes the death of neighboring trees due to severe weather. I think about this description frequently, as with many Fisher musings the viewpoint lingers."
3,Tiresome,"While I'm generally a fan of M.F.K. Fisher, this particular collection just seems incredibly self-indulgent, and of no particular interest to anyone but Fisher herself. In that context, if one has read Fisher widely, it's just tedious to get through, and one can see why so many of her contemporaries in the culinary world brushed her off as not to be taken seriously.The stories in this collection have largely appeared elsewhere, and one has the sense the collection was put together as a new title just to provide Ms. Fisher with an infusion of cash.TryTwo Towns in Provenceinstead. I love that one -- especially the Aix-en-Provence years, and revisiting Aix with her daughters."
2,Rod Stewart Can Bore You in Five Songs?,"I say Stewart can bore me in four songs. Challenge me. Maybe he can bore you in three? Two? One? The highlights really have to be the few Ronnie Lane pieces and Ooh La La. Oh yea, there is Losing You, Maybe I'm Amazed, and Stay with Me. Stewart handles those well. But overall, Stewart's voice is just too damn irritating to enjoy for long."
4,Great,"I bought this set to put some color and fun in my daughter's room. It did wonder to complete a fairy theme. It gives you the possibility to personalize the way you want to use it (words only, big fairies, small fairies etc...Overall it is good quality and has not come off (it's been over 9 months now). Only two pieces out of the whole set had a corner or part that didn't want to adhere properly, but the pieces were still able to stay on the wall."
5,Pure Speed,"There's a great film coming our way. ""Lola rennt"" (Lola runs) is a highspeed chase story set on a summer midday in Berlin. It is told form three different perspectives and is driven by a pumping techno soundtrack co-composed by the film's direct Tom Tykwer. The whole album is a pulsating electronic speed trip that owes as much to Kraftwerk's ""Autobahn"" as to the drummers of Miles Davis' electric phase and the trip hop phantasies of Portishead and Massive Attack. It got the Berlin techno groove down to a populist point that makes it bearable to a wider audience without betraying it's roots."
2,Very Disappointing,"Genival Lacerda recorded lots of wonderful, beautiful sounding, amazing Forro records.Unfortunately, this compilation features his later work, which sounds sterile and bland. It may be OK for comedy, but the music is mediocre.Popularidade is much better."
1,worthless,"I bought this a couple of years ago so i could take pictures for my student directed play. It took the worst pictures I had ever seen. At the time it was a lot more than it is now, and it wan't worth what I paid for it, it works ok as webcam, but that is it. A blind person could take better pictures than this thing does. That is no joke. I had to be real up close and personal for the picture to be of any count and in theater you don't want closeups of everything anymore than you do in movies."
1,JUNK !,I bought this product under a 'Vivitar' label at a local large drug store chain. It it is exactly the same camera (with a different name) and it worthless. It is good for absolutely nothing.
2,Disappointing,"A short book, with a short section by Ratzinger that reiterates Gelasius I, which if nothing else speaks volumes on the mindset of Benedict XVI. Otherwise, little that is noteworthy."
5,Ulala's cosmic attack #1 game,"I heard that this game had bad ratings but i had wanted it so much i just had to have it. I started playing this game and i was amazed by the amazing graphics, funky music and outragous dance moves. I was loved every moment of it. I finished the game and it had an interesting ending. I loved every part of it and it is my favorite game of all time. ^_^"
1,Badder than bad. Not worth anything.,"I don't write reviews, but this game made me start. I wanted to warn all of you; don't waste your money.Waste of time and money. I had to try to get some store to take it back to exchange for another game. I told them it didn't work. They put it in a game system and no one there questioned me that it didn't work. They all look puzzled at what to do and if the game was working. I felt bad about doing this, but I felt like I was ripped off. I read the reviews here and thought this game might be fun for the kids.If you like THQ games and want something involving rhythm, music or dance, then I would suggest Britney's Dance Beat (but that got poor reviews too).One game that the kids love to play similar to Britney is American Idol. Don't ask me why, but they love to play it."
5,No Exceptions,"Bennie's latest creation shows just how talented and how much he has persevered with all that he's been through.Whether it's ""reflections"" on important decisions in his life, or his need to just relax, he thoughtfully persues his words with fantastic display.This is a must-read for anyone who is looking for inspiration, guidance, or just a good book to read on a nice sunny day."
5,Brilliant,"""Alchemy in Middle Earth"" illustrates how the great J. R. R. Tolkien wove Islamic and Judeo-Christian mystical symbology throughout the Lord of the Rings. I found myself re-reading this book several times.I am a Muslim and I made gifts of this book to some Imams (Islamic ""ministers"") of my aquaintance. They were all impressed with the content of the book and of the brilliant scholarship of both Tolkien and Shelton."
5,impressed,"I heard about this Bible from a Pastor. When I went to the US I looked at it, but it took me some time to finally decide because of the price. I'm glad I decided to buy.I like it because:1) It does not have commentary, i.e. it is not in the usual study Bible format2) I like the high quality design - cover, binding, layout3) I like to make notes in my Bible, and the margins allow for that4) I appreciate the thoughtful ruled pages for notes5) It is easy on the eyesI would prefer a more in-depth concordance.Considering what I know about Bibles (I managed a Bible Bookstore), I rank this as a top-grade Bible that would serve a lifetime, with care."
5,Best Wide Margin Bible in Print.,"I believe the Cambridge wide margin, model 267 is the best wide margin bible in print. I've personally seen to it that all my Deacons and most of my Sunday School teachers all their own. I love this model."
5,Absolutly nothing like it!,"I have been a Christian for 13 years and I have had a few Scofields, Thompson Chain and even, the Cambridge competitor, the [$$] Oxford Wide Margin. All were KJV Bibles, of course, and all where nice Bibles. But, I have always admired the quality, workmanship and finish of a Cambridge WM. There is nothing like this Bible. From the lined note pages to the quality of the Calf Skin leather all the way down to the ""Bible Paper.""My first Scofield lasted nine months. My second lasted through my first two semesters of Bible College. My Thompson Chain has been faithul and lasted me for 9 years! And the Oxford...I couldn't ever get used to it. But, now I must say I am ready to ""settle down"" with a Bible that could easily last until my new born child graduates high school and starts college!I look forward to reading and studying God's preserved Word in this unique package!"
3,"If you liked ""I Am Free""","If you liked ""I am Free"" from the Newsboys, then you'd love the original version by the Desperation Band in ""From the Rooftops."" Jared Anderson is amazing and the song rocks so much that it just doesn't sound right coming from the Newsboys."
1,Wherever We Go - a guaranteed station changer,"""I Am Free"" rates the album 1 star; the single rated alone deserves five.However, ""Wherever We Go"" automatically takes off the other four stars and immediately shuts off KLOVE (Christian Radio Station) for me. It's a self-focused, syrupy hap-hap-happy song that 1) doesn't say much about honoring God IMO and 2) doesn't minister to Christians struggling through daily, ordinary trials. The following lyrics don't characterize most of our lives wherever 'we' go, not to mention the words are ridiculous to the point of offense.Where we go, little glow-worms glowLittle roadrunners run aheadGonna tell their friendsLittle mice, little menGet `em all excitedAll invited"
5,Newsboys are getting better,I think thisGoCd is one of the best. They have other ones that rank very high. I would recomend this for anyone who Christian music.
4,Classic Newsboys,Another good effort from the Newsboys. Catchy lyrics and melodies that stay in the head. I've enjoyed listening to this over the last month.
2,Best Album? Please...,"This album gets boring toward the end. The first couple of songs are good, but the rest is just OK. Nothing that interest me. The special edition is good for long time fans, with the following of the band, and a behind the scenes look. But overall, not their best album, but STUPENDOUS compared to the rest of the stuff they've come out with so far in the decade. Still looking for the old Newsboys."
4,Very Uplifting,"This was my first foray into the music of the Newsboys and I was very satisfied with the results. The music is very fun to listen to and is very uplifting. I find myself humming some of the tracks throughout the day (""O, it's gonna be alright..."").Track 1 is certainly a bit cheesy and some of the songs don't work as well as others (""Let it all come out""), but the party songs (""Something Beautiful"", ""The Mission"", and the title track) totally make up for it.In the end it's the message that matters, and the Newsboys deliver one of hope to the listener. Many artists are quick to write about the ugly and bad things in life and ignore the beautiful. Not so here. We are immersed in the love of God, and reminded that we live in ""a revolution Jesus started"" and it is our duty to proclaim that to the world."
5,it's great,"if you like the last 3 years of newsboys, then you like this. they are great, probably becasue they are not american and stuck to our culture view of life. they bring in their perspective which helps remind me life is bigger than american."
5,Upbeat and Worshipful,"My first Newsboys album ever -- and my favorite. It's upbeat, thought-provoking, worshipful music. The first song,""Wherever We Go,"" sets the tone, high-spirited, whimsical, and joyous. ""In Wonder"" is a mesmerizing worship song, praising God for the wonders of His world. My personal favorite is ""Your Love is Better than Life,"" a funky oddball featuring Peter Furler almost-rapping and a synthesizer opening. And let's not forget radio hits, the smooth pop ""Something Beautiful,"" a staple at modern Christian weddings; and the Newsboy's exuberant cover of ""I Am Free."" This album is a major highlight in the Furler era and Newsboys discography. Don't miss Go!"
5,BEST NEWSBOYS ALBUM,"No question: This album is the best from the Newsboys.1-2: It starts out with an optomistic song called ""Wherever We Go,"" that encourages the next song ""Go.""3: ""Something Beautiful"" is an awesome tribute to beautiful things including marriage.4-5: ""The Mission"" is a song reminding us to follow Jesus, and ""Let It All Come Out"" is a song telling us to let go of the lies Satan has told you.6: ""In Wonder"" racks your brain with the wonder of God's Creation.7: I didn't know Peter Furler could rap, but he proved he could in ""Your Love is Better Than Life.""8: ""I Am Free"" reminds us that we are truly free to live for God.9: ""Secret Kingdom"" talks about the power in God's Kingdom(+Whistles make for better mixes).10: ""The Letter"" is a song dedicated to Peter's wife Summer (Or so I've heard)11: Finally, ""Gonna Be Alright"" is a lullaby with a great message.***If you like the ""GO"" CD, I suggest ""GO REMIXED."" It gives a brand new twist to each song***Go Remixed"
5,Awesome!,"I already had Newboys ""He Reigns: the Worship Album"", which I love. I bought ""Go"" specifically for the song ""In Wonder"", which I think is one of the best songs that the Newsboys have ever done. Well, the whole album is GREAT! It is not so much praise and worship, but rather really, really good music.... especially for driving! I have a mix of albums in my changer, because sometimes I do like to sing along with praise and worship songs, - but other times I just like to crank up the volume and enjoy the artistic talents of this band. I give this album an enthusiastic five stars!!"
5,Great CD,"I'm an old-school Newsboys fan who was a bit disappointed that they spent so much time making retreds of other people's music on ""Adoration"" and ""Devotion"". One reason that I love the Newsboys older music like ""Breakfast"" and ""Take me to your leader"" is for the brilliantly witty lyrics by Steve Taylor. I'm dating myself, but I was a fan of his solo career, and I've never heard lyrics to top those on ""I want to be a clone"". Teaming up with the musical powerhouse of the Newsboys was a superb combination. So I am glad to hear them recording their own music again, and these songs have blessed me a lot. ""In Wonder"" is a better worship song than any from their last two albums. ""Go"" is the great commission put to modern rock. And ""Your love is better than life"" is classic Newsboys fun with a solid message."
2,Bad Entertainment,"Just to let everyone know this dvd was made as soft porn, not that I expected to see otherwise.With that in mind-only purchase if you're interested in how X rated movies were made, back then."
3,"""I Will Bow To You"" by: Bob Fitts","It was okay... He brought some good points and he had some weak points. Some of his perspectives, while obviously based on Christian docterine and belief, lacked 'real world' practicality and experience. But, then it appears Mr. Fitts wrote this when he was youthful, idealistic, and a bit nieve. Not that this is bad, just a personal observation from an older person's perspective.Bottom line: Bob's music is better than his literary talents. Put down the pen and stick with the guitar."
4,lessons learned,"A delightful story about children, their fears, and a wondeful teacher who helps put their fears to rest. It centers on a trip taken by the teacher and his class to the beach, and his conversations with the children in which they confess their secrets. I remember it from when I was a child. I used it to overcome my own child's fear of the dark. Accelerated third graders to sixth grade level."
5,Required reading,"If you're buying a piano -- new or used, vertical or grand -- you need this supplement. Why? Not only does it show current MSRPs for the pianos, but it also gives an update on various piano manufacturers. There's nothing worse that relying on out-of-date information."
2,ehh...,well it connected to my computer fine but i wanted to use it in my car because my car stereo is not white like the traditional ipod usb cable. when i used this on my brand new JCV touchscreen the stereo could not read an ipod or iphone that i hooked up to it. i did try to use it on my computer and it worked fine there. so i just dont understand how this couldnt work in my car but a white cable would.
5,"Good for: iPhone 3GS 16 & 32GB, iPod touch 3G","It worked as soon as I plug it in to my computer, it worked with my iPhone 3GS 32 gb, my iPod touch 3G and my sister's iPhone 3GS 16gb.That's all I wanted it for.Yes, I would say you can buy it and be sure is going to work."
3,Not very long,If you're looking for a long cord like I was I do not recommend this cord at all. It looks like a cheap black version of the standard cord that comes with all ipods but you cant beat the price and it seems to be working just fine.
1,Doesn't work - at all,Simply doesn't work. Tried to connect my iphone to regular apple power supply and to PC usb port. Nothing. Waste of time and $3.
4,Yup... it's a cable...,"Not a lot to say here... But, it's a good quality cable, especially for the price, and works great with my iPod Touch and iPod Nano."
2,"Syncs fine, doesn't charge my iPhone 3GS","I bought one of these to have a spare. It syncs both my iPod Nano 1st Gen and my iPhone 3GS, but it only charges the Nano. A yellow warning triangle appears on the 3GS stating the accessory does not support charging.Cable construction, etc appear fine, so no complaints there. It is about 3 feet long."
3,Missing something...,"The cable works fine as a data cable but only will charge my iphone 3GS about 1 in 10 times. Not sure why, but if you need reliable charging from a cable, look for something else."
1,THIS IS NOT A LONG CABLE,"This is not a long cable, infact it is smaller than the regular 3ft cable.Was really looking for a long black cable to connect it in my car. The charging station is further away from where I dock the iphone.I bought this cable looking at all the reviews, and everyone is raving about this cable being long.Really disappointing."
3,Not as good as I expected by BJ,"I've heard a ton of hype about Jeremy Camp (rightly so, because he's an excellent singer), but this release wasn't as good as I expected. I bought it at Winter Jam 2007 where I live in Mobile, AL. At the concert, Jeremy was fantastic, so I bought his CD--I'm not saying I regret it, but it's not the best CD in the world.The first four songs of the CD are fabulous and really catchy. ""Tonight"", ""What It Means"", (two #1 hits), and ""Let It Fade"" all take on a rock approach while the title track goes to a softer note. Of course, there are some other good songs on the CD, and Jeremy's voice is excellent, but most of the songs aren't as catchy and fun to listen to. But don't get me wrong--I would still recommend this CD to many people...not everyone has the same opinion as I do, anyway."
4,"Many good songs, but lacks the little extra...","I bought Jeremy`s previous album, ""Restored"", and loved it. This new album has a bit different sound to it, and I feel it sounds a bit ""stressed"" and CCM compared to Restored. On the second half I feel Jeremy slows a bit down and I find many of the songs really inspiring, especially the last track is really good.If you are new to Mr. Camp I will advise you to buy ""Restored"" first as it it truly outstanding, however ""Beyound Measure"" is also a good album and well worth a listen."
1,eh,As what happens to alot of artist. After so many records and great albums. Jeremy has proven that he has lost it with Beyond Measure. This is a cheap attempt to make a mainstream album.
5,great cd,I have really enjoyed this cd. It is a real inspiration. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys contemporary christian music
3,"Different Style, Lighter Sound","Let me start off by saying that I am a big Jeremy Camp fan. His prior albums 'Stay' and 'Restored' are terrific.This is an album with a totally different style for Jeremy. It has a lighter sound and is less intense than his previous work. The lyrics are great. As always, he speaks from the heart and with deep convictions in his songwriting. Soundwise, I don't think he is not using his great talents to the fullest here.There are some very good songs in this collection: 'Tonight', 'What It Means', 'When You Are Near', and and 'Give You Glory' are all really good. Additionally, 'Give Me Jesus' is a very nice sounding song. Jeremy's wife Adie, who is an artist in her own right, adds some beautiful sounding vocals.If you are a big Jeremy Camp fan, you may want to get this. If you are not familiar with him, I would recommend his albums 'Stay' and 'Restored' over this one."
2,Not satisfied...below average,"This CD wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. I had heard it was one of the topsellers in Christian music for it's first week in stores, so I went out and bought it like so many other people. After listening, I was glad I got it on SALE--this album has only a few good songs on it in my opinion, and got WAY more hype than it deserved. Of course, I think Jeremy's a great singer, but I expected a lot more when I bought this album. If you want EXCELLENT music, then try Avalon'sFaith: A Hymns Collection, Aaron Shust's debutAnything Worth Saying, orLifesongby Casting Crowns.For this product, overall I was somewhat disappointed."
2,Just MY opinion,"FIRST let me echo what another reviewer shared in that this is NOT an attack on Jeremy Camp. Nor is it a question of his heart or faith or anything else. Given what he's been through in his life I simply could NOT do that. That said ,it seems to me that this music is rubber stamped CCM.I too was excited when Stay released with the rawness of many of the songs. ESPECIALLY Understand and Take My Life. But have been disappointed with each subsequent release. If,as another reviewer has stated, God is indeed writing these songs, then I need to ask His forgiveness. But He has made us all different and this is just my opinion. IF you like Contemporary Christian Music then this is for you. If you're wanting to rock then I'd continue my search elsewhere."
3,Good album - but not his best,"Three GREAT songs on here: ""Tonight"", ""No Matter What"", and ""Give You Glory"". These songs showcase Jeremy's deep voice and highlight his vocal range and are very ""hard rock"". I like them. However, a lot of the other songs on the album are too soft and a little wishy-washy.I hope his next album has more songs like ""Tonight"" and ""No Matter What"" on it. I am a big Jeremy fan."
2,Something new?,"Jeremy Camp is back with a new album, but it lacks the fresh depth of his last few, both lyrically and musically. We've heard this before on both sides. I recommend just downloading the ""Give Me Jesus"" song, a remake of a beautiful classic!"
3,Association Review,"There are alot of songs that I never heard on this CD....I guess their greatest hits would have only consisted of about 6 songs, so they filled the rest of the CD up with so-so songs"
1,"the cd was worthless, It didn't work",the CD didn't play/work. My mother was so bummed out as I had it sent to her as a gift.
4,"A classic, but needs an update","Contains all their big hits, but none of their later material. It was a straight re-issue of the 1968 LP, which was pretty much the norm in the early days of CD's. But this excellent set is long over due for an update, including remastering. Add another 5 or 6 songs from their later albums and it would be an easy 5 star CD. As is it is very good. ""Everything That Touches You"" is one of the best love songs to come out of the 60's. ""Windy"" and ""Cherish"" are classics. Nobody sounded like the Association."
2,"Oh, that's rich...","Sure, just take the old Greatest Hits, put it in a cardboard slipcase, and charge a dollar more for it. Right, where do I sign up? I guess Am@zon didn't notice that they're selling this same disc without the slipcase for a dollar less. And I guess Time Warner is hoping that by stamping the Rhino logo on the slipcase, people will be fooled into thinking the disc actually sounds good. This sort of thing would never have happened when Rhino was still an indy..."
5,Another Bang up job from Bang on a Can composers!,"SO Percussion ensemble is a hot young New York percussion group with an exploring sensibility and plenty of chops. The works included here are by two of the composers closely associated with the Bang on a Can Festival, Evan Ziporyn and David Lang. Ziporyn's ""Melody Competition"" evokes elements I associate with some of the music of Bali, not surprising considering that Ziporyn directs a Balinese gamelan ensemble at MIT. Lang's ""So-Called Laws of Nature"" is slightly more ambitious, evolving in three movements for different instrumental combinations. I like the 2nd movement, where bell sounds eventually evolve into drums, and the 3rd movement, that sounds like the joyful romping of children in a mound of broken glass. It's been a long time since a recording label produced such consistently excellent stuff. Thanks, Cantelope, for another beauty!"
2,Too Many Mistakes,"There are just far too many mistakes in the book to be able to give much credit to the values it lists. Supposidly the author is some sort of expert on guns, but there are many, many errors in models, manufacturers, etc. to believe he has much experience at all. Pass on this one."
4,Looking For History Of Old Gun,I'm in the Royal malaysian police. I'm looking for history about an old sidearms in our force by name Revolver.38 Mark IV Webley. I just be informed that this pistol from Great Britain. I really need more info regarding this side arms. Can you send me this history of Webley thru email as soon as possible. I appreciate you can help and solve my big trouble. Thank you.
1,Should be titled Worst of Hagar,"Sammy never had an ear for production. This selection of tracks has Sammy's fingerprints all over it. These songs share the horrible sound mix where every instrument sounds like it was captured at a low volume with the mic resting on top of it and lacking large room ambience. There must be a guaranteed payout somewhere in a contract for Sammy. Release any album for $X regardless of sales. Where are all of the best tunes? This is for the fans who have everything. The ultimate collection of his worst material on one disc. A side note, in his recent autobiography Samy mentions not being able to get anyone anywhere, including his home SF Bay Area stations where he was already loved, to play ""Sittin' by the Dock of the Bay"" when it was released. I am pretty certain it was for no other reason than being one of the worst covers of all time.......mediocre karaoke."
2,typical self-published work,"This is the typical self-published work: a meandering diary sent direcly to the press without any editing or proofreading.I'm guessing the other reviewer is a Florida buddy of ""Bill."""
5,An excellent experience,Book arrived in mint condition (as far as I can tell--I haven't looked at every single page yet) and within a week of ordering. Vendor used high-quality packing materials--indicated to me that they really cared that I'd be satisfied with my order. Would definitely use again.
5,SPRING SHAKE UP,"No New Year's resolutions for me. Every spring I like to take stock and re-focus my attitude. Lucky me. I found ""Change the Way..."" extremely positive and upbeat while packed with serious thoughstarters and guidelines. I had fun reading it. I never felt beaten down with heavy self-help negativity but rather uplifted by the light style and photographs. ""Change the Way..."" actually practices as it preaches! I'll go back to this book again and again to reflect, refocus and re-enter my life. I highly recommend it."
5,For a better attitude please read,"Not only does this book have beautiful, fun pictures, but it is addictingly positive! The best picture book I have ever read! And I'm a teacher, so I read picture books all the time!"
3,"Great strap, awful vendor","I love Domke products. Nearly all my camera bags are Domke, and I especially like the straps due to the rubber sewn in to provide a really grippy service.I saw a six-pack of the 1"" straps listed by Adorama on Amaxon for a really great price and ordered them. Instead of six straps, I received one. Upon contacting the vendor, they said it was a listing error by a ""third party"", and they weren't responsible. Their offer was for me to return the strap for a refund.I then contacted Amazon directly. The customer service rep stated that the vendor IS responsible for the listing, third party listing service notwithstanding.Eventually I was issued credits and was able to keep the strap. So the issue was resolved thanks to Amazon policies, but my experience with Adorama was quite negative and I will not buy from them again."
1,Company did not ship the item,"Over the years I have purchased many products from Amazon and this company. I purchased the item in good faith figuring it was a closeout. After waiting several weeks I did not receive the item ordered. The company said they made a mistake and would not be shipping out the order. They did offer a refund and said I could order the product at the adjusted price. (It was much higher) six times the price. I wrote back and said I would like the item as advertised. They would not budge. They sent out a refund before I even talked to them. In that respect the customer service was good. I would have liked the item instead but they would not ship it. I like the company, but did not agree with them in this transaction. Thus no product, no review."
4,my son loves it!,"My son loves this toy. I often use it to occupy him or odstract him when he is bored or getting into something he shouldn't be. He dances with the robot and knows how to operate his spitting function, even though he's only 3! I have had no issues with the batteries; ours turns off automatically because it has a battery saving mechanism. The robot even says goodbye. The down side is to be careful when the robots shoots the disks from his mouth. They are lightweight, but my son did get hit in the eye. (the robot was on the coffee table, but is really meant to be on the floor.)He didn't really get hurt, just a little freaked out."
1,D.O.A. Disappointment on Arrival,"Six fresh, new batteries and... nothing. Dead in the box and a birthday disappointment. Avoid this toy."
1,Bad manufacturing quality,"The toy lasted all of two hours before it just stopped working. New batteries, etc., had no effect. Too bad - it was fun while it lasted. Would NOT buy this toy - there are much higher quality, more durable remote control toys than this in the same price range."
1,dead on arrival,"This was a gift from grandma. We put in all six required batteries -- didn't work. Four year old son had fun taking it apart with Dad, however. I was happy it didn't work. It shoots out little disks from it's mouth, dances and ""parties""... just real dumb stuff. Cheaply made. Even if it worked, it probably wouldn't work long."
4,Not that complete,"Hi, I just wanted to say that for those saying that the ""Complete"" series are composed of 26 episodes, they're wrong, the FULL series are 30 Episodes. With a not that bad ending."
5,Awesome new comic series!,"This looks like the beginning of something fantastic! Something big.The lady starring in this new comic has NO CLUE just how special she is! She is about to find out, THE HARD WAY.There as humanoid creatures living beneath the sea, who are not too thrilled with their so-called government and plan to change things. Land humans beware!Reviewed by Detra Fitch."
5,Toe ring,Love the toe ring. Very beautiful..just as discribed. I will order again soon!! Thank you so much!!
2,Generic emo.,"Juno is to Cap'n Jazz what Candlebox were to Soundgarden. Nice, melodic, driving? Sure. Derivitive, unoriginal, mediocre? Absolutely. File next to Death Cab For Cutie."
2,Cap'n Jazz? No.,"The Cap'n Jazz comparison was a bad one, on my part. Juno may not sound like Cap'n Jazz, but there are hundreds of bands that Juno DO sound like. Juno, like Death Cab For Cutie, are one of the most grossly overrated bands from this area, and the only thing distinguishing them from the rest of the bands mining the post-punk/indie-rock/emo/whatever you wanna call it, is the fact that they have three guitars. Well, whoop de doo."
5,simply the best,"Clarence Jones has a real winner here and has for years. My only regret is that I only recently became aware of his publication. It is easily the most comprehensive, yet practical guide to dealing with the media that I have run across on the market. Jones' work is very readable and well organized so that you can quickly find information relevant to your particular need.Of equal importance, he has kept the book current over the years. He has successfully adapted to the constantly changing dynamics and practices of the industry.Quite simply, I believe that this book is a ""must read"" for anyone who interacts with the media on a regular basis. Having recently aquired an MA in communication studies, I have read my share of books on similar topics; ""Winning with the News Media"" simply has no peer."
2,Mafia redux,"This is a barely competant book that only a die-hard mafia buff could enjoy. Since I consider myself one, I slogged through this book, which touches on all the well known mafia hits, etc. written about in dozens of other books and magazine articles. I say that unless Volkman and other mafia writers can come up with something new (and this book ain't it), there should be a moratorium on mafia books."
3,"""Gangbasters"" by Earnest Volkman",Well written book. I bought the book because I saw Volkman on Mobsters and he was really entertaining. I didn't learned new things about the Gambino
3,Captivating.,Book kept my attention throughout. But I wonder if it was more because of the subject material than the writing.
2,Middle-of-the-road Mafia rehash,"This book might be interesting to someone from Iowa or Kansas or somewhere where the Mafia has not been reported on much. To anyone who is knowledgable about the subject this will be a plodding, not terribly well-written rehash of familiar material. Don't be fooled by the five-star customer reviews. This book doesn't even belong on the shelf with the really good mob books (Wiseguy, Donnie Brasco, The Westies, etc.)."
3,A very informative book,Gangbusters is probably the best book that explains the history of the Lucchese Family. I was quite impressed of how Volkman wrote this masterpeice. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the Underworld.
3,great ending...average story..,"Neil Albert's ""January Corpse"" has one of the better endings to any mystery. It is a bit inspired by the ""Crying Game"", but it is original, and Albert had a lot of guts to do it. Otherwise, this novel is average in plot. A disbarred lawyer is hired by the family of a lawyer who disappered seven years before to invesigate his disappearence so he can be declared dead for insurance purposes. What is discovered is that the mob wants some property that the missing man supposedly had. Soon, the man's sister helps our hero to try and find the truth. There are hints at the ending, but we are taken by surprise. the ending earns this book 3 stars."
4,Family entertaimnt at its best. Father/daughter story.,"12 yr.old girl discovers hr belove father has a character flaw and realizing hr mom and dad are on different wave-lenths, decides to become her father's guardian angel. True story of Adela Rogers St. John and her father, famed defense lawyer Earl Rogers, who was the model for Perry Mason. Takes place in 1919. Great production values."
5,Love These Sliders,"Bought these furniture sliders becuase my wife likes to move the furniture around quite often. These sliders allow us to easily move the furniture around on carpet, tile, or wood floors. I highly recommend this product."
1,Not what I thought,My 8 year-old daughter loves Jesse... and doesn't brush her teeth more than 1 minute. I thought this would be perfect for her. The song only plays about 5 seconds and you can't even hear it. She tried brushing really hard... then soft... then angled... and so on. Nothing works. It was just a waste of $20.
