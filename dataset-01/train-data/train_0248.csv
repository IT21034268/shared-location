2,Cannot weight light items,"Tried to use this to weight light envelop under 5 oz, it tells you 0 oz. Then I went to postal office and was told it was 5oz. No AC adapter. I'm going to buy a much better one at a cheaper price on ebay."
3,CUTE DOG TOY,"My 12 pound Yorkie/Maltese (Morkie) can tear apart any stuffed toy! This being said....I decided to try this ""indestructible"" toy for her Christmas stocking. Well...she didn't DESTROY the toy but she did chew the foot to the point of getting to the stuffing! So it may last longer than a traditional stuffed doggie toy....but it definitely can be destroyed! She also has some difficulty with it because of it's size. Probably better for a little larger dog."
4,SHOCKING,"Unbelievable! If you like Sportbikes and pulling wheelies, these guys are pulling off some of the craziest motorcycle stunts I've ever seen, and doing them in the most dangerous places. It was exciting all the way through. The best part is the crash section! One dude eats it hard on a crowded freeway and hobbles off and is rushed to the hospital with multiple injuries. I originally purchased this DVD for my husband, but I watch it more than him."
3,Good Toaster,"This is a good toaster; the best thing about it is the wide slots -- good for bagels. I also like having 4 slots with two control settings so that you can make toast for 2 people, made to order. The only thing I don't really care for is the lever on the slots -- you need to push it into place carefully and make sure that the red indicator light comes on. Sometimes you have to do it a couple of times to make it ""stick""."
5,A must have for every child's bookshelf!,My daughter was enchanted with the bright and wonderful illustrations in this book. The text reads almost like a song as the rhyming scheme is so well done. Hoping Mr. Guiffre' will write many more of these enchanting books!
5,Tasty Jerky,Received my order of Honey Pepper Jerky a couple days ago. The jerky is sweet and the pepper is very good without being overwhelming. I generally prefer jerky that is very dry and chewy but I really enjoyed the taste and texture of this product. I would not hesitate to order again or recommend to others.
5,Amazing Jerky!,"I got this and the western cut sweet n' spicy. I liked this more. The country cut is thicker pieces and overall just better; seems more homemade. I love the combination of the pepper and the honey. You wouldn't know it was honey; it just adds a little sweetness. I wouldn't have liked a strong honey flavor anyway. It also has a smell that I really like. You have to try it. If you have to pick one kind of Buffalo Bills, try this one first."
3,"Tastes good, but...","I can definitely say that the flavor is good. It's not overly peppery - a big plus - and is very savory sweet. However, it's not as tender as I'd hoped. Finally, I had some issues with tough sinewy bits, making me wonder if this is really the highest quality cut available.Overall, it's fine; certainly better than most. I cannot say as certainly if I'll purchase again, though."
5,id swim in it,"Seriously some good stuff I've been eating it all day so good. I began to drink a couple of brews now it can't get any better don't judge me yup, but yeah awesome quality must buy again!"
5,Jerky,I liked this jerky alot but my wife found it a little sweet. Must have been the honey. Thought it would be a bigger package.
3,A bit too detailed here and there,I did enjoy this book other than some chapters which were dedicated to each and every (usually) officer he served with in the Philippines before and during WWII. Over all it gives a picture of Manila before the war began and how truly diversified its culture was at that time. And the life of an army infantry officer before hostilities started. Also the complete disorder once the Japanese began their bombing campaign even though the command was warned well in advance. Of the horrors of becoming a POW in the hands of the Japanese army including transport on unmarked ships carrying our POWs from the PI to Formosa and beyond.
2,duplicity disc,"season 4, disc 6 is missing.in it's place there s, again, disc 5; a duplicity; disc 5 is twice in the set."

4,Ally McBeal: The Complete Series,"seasons 1 - 4 were pure Ally McBeal, everything I remembered and loved. Season 5 was hard to watch. Not many shows were able to pull together their 2001 -2002 season and with it's cast issues, it appeared to try too much or not enough."
4,book,I bought this product for my wife a while back for my wife. She has really enjoyed the shows. Wouyld recommend this to others.
4,finally!!!!,"After all this time of waiting I'm so glad to finally have this serie in dvd. The box is really nice and solid and contains 6 dvd cases inside. One for Each seasons plus one with extras and a cd of the best of songs from ally Mc Beal. The Cases are pretty nice they are all in a different color with a different picture of Ally on top of it! Inside the cases all of the titles of the episodes are written for each disc!It is a pretty simple boxset, but nicely put up anyway! I'm glad of my purchase!!"
5,"If you love and MISS Ally McBeal, get this set.","I loved this show. When I found the complete set on Amazon, I snapped it up. I watch about one show a week and it is just terrific to have them when I want them."
1,FLAW IN DVD 1 / EPISODE 2,"AMAZON SENT 2 SETS AND BOTH FROZE UP IN THE SAME SPOT ON THE FIRST SEASON, DVD 1, EPISODE 2. AMAZON WON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THIS FLAW NOR GET A BATCH IN THAT'S CORRECT ANF OFF'D THEN BY DISCOUNTING THEM IB THE GUISE OF A GREAT DEAL."
5,Ally McBeal Series,"Never syndicated (bygones) so it was easy to forget just how good the show really was! The catch phrases, buzz words, Vonda and the musical guest stars (Barry White, Chubby Checkers, Barry Manilow, Sting just to name a few). Tell him! We GOT it together baby! And the guest cast is a who's who of TV and film. Even if you were a fan of the show you will be amazed at the people who you forgot made appearances. I expected to find watching this late 1990's era show to be dated. It wasn't. (Well, except maybe the Blue Swede dancing baby.) This is a quirkly legal show that was ultimately a comedy- and more about sex, relationships, and just growing up than about law. This is one compilation you are going to want in your DVD library."
3,study worthy,"If you have the drive to be in the appraisal business buy this book, full of helpful tips to continue."
1,disappointment,"Sadly, Portuguese is not well served when it comes to up-to-date and comprehensive bilingual dictionaries, and this is no exception. It does provide basic terms, but you will look in vain for such useful expressions as ""posicao vendida"" or ""posicao comprada,"" for example, or ""balcao"" in the sense of ""bank branch"" or ""over the counter (stock trading),"" etc.That said, I have to admit it's a step forward. Just don't expect too much."
4,Enjoyable,"I loved this show as a kid, and have the complete series on DVD. Always wanted the two movies on DVD. Just waiting to get second one to complete the collection. This movie is way better than the remake."
5,Well My Dad loved it,This was above and beyond what I expected. It was quite cute and funny. It's an old show so of course the special effects were amusing.
3,terrific acting.,it was good but not as good as some of the tv shows.i did like that it was in color and not black&white.joe flynn and ernest borgnine are absolutely terific in these shows.
5,Excellent DVD!!!,"I purchased Marvin Sapp's latest DVD Thirsty before purchasing this one so I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this one definitely as much. I know it has been around for a couple of years but it is definitely one of those offerings that I can see myself enjoying for years to come. Marvin Sapp is an excellent performer and his musicians were absolutely world class.It makes me appreciate how much talent was in one group with Commissioned.....Fred Hammond, Marvin Sapp, Keith Staten etc.."
3,NOT the graphic novel,"In my haste, I did not realize this was NOT the original graphic novel I was looking for but instead the screenplay version in text.Aside from that, it is what it is; The screenplay/script to the movie. So if you want the screenplay, all is well, if you want the original graphic novel, you're out of luck."
3,Okay.,"Not bad. A Little better than the movie (the emotions in it seemed a bit flat, plus copied the book 95% in scenes and script)."
3,Required College Reading,Required reading for my son's college course. He is an avid reader so I'm sure he liked the book. Thanks
5,Excellent Book,"Put simply this is an excellent story. People will argue semantics over whether the graphic novel, novel adaptation, or live action film is better. I personally have only seen the movie and read the novel. Both were excellent. The book fleshes out what the movie could not. The novel contains a profound message, and is well worth reading. If you are in to comics, then buy the graphic novel. If you don't read, and only watch film adaptations, then watch the movie. Whatever you decide on, the story is well worth a read. Now, I am off to find this graphic novel everyone is so hyped up about."
1,Not to be confused with Alan Moore's work,"I'm always a bit suspicious when someone releases a novelization of a movie based on a novel or, in this case, a graphic novel. After all, one would expect that the original work upon which the movie was based would suffice. My suspicions of this novelization were heightened by the cover which proclaims ""an uncompromising vision of the future from the creators of The Matrix trilogy"" and ""a novelization by Steve Moore based on the screenplay written by the Wachowski brothers"". Admittedly Alan Moore doesn't want his name associated in any way with the movie but these two statements create the impression that ""V For Vendetta"" is entirely the creation of the Wachowski brothers.Once you get into the book...well let's just say its done nothing to change my opinion of novelizations of movies based on novels. If you want to read ""V For Vendetta"" do yourself a big favor and get Alan Moore's graphic novel instead of this novelization."
4,This will tide you over...,"...Until the DVD comes out.I was pleasantly suprised to find that the author of this novelization is fond of the original graphic novel enough to incorporate elements that were absent in the film. He tones down V's emotional side and enhances the sequences such as the Larkhill flashback and Evey's incarceration with lots of background information that got left out.I love the movie but I was disapointed with some of the changes made. This novel is a great combination of the two and is very evocatively written besides.The only thing that loses a star is that it follows the script of the movie nearly to a word. Usually novelizations are based on earlier versions of the script and so they contain extra scenes and such, but this one doesn't. If you're really attached to the script this is a good thing, but I was sort of hoping for a new spin on things.I'd still highly recommend it, though."
3,Not based on the Bush Administration,"I'd just like to answer kickboxer lightning who can't spell government right. This movie isn't supposed to be based on the Bush admin. This is supposed to be based on a comic book from the 1980's set in 1997. I gave this 3 stars because I haven't read this yet or seen the movie, I just had to clear that up."
2,Do not be fooled,"This author steeps his product with an endorsement of our loss of rights, privacy, and freedom. Read 'No Pleace to Hide' by Robert O'Harrow, Jr. if you want substance and details. O'Harrow's work gets a good review from William Safire."
3,good discussion on the privacy/technology debate,"This book is an EXCELLENT reference tool for anyone interested in this subject. I expected the book to focus more on technological developments and their implications, rather than the psych 101/human nature 101 lecture that it turned out to be. Furthermore, the constant references to the author's own work throughout the book were intrusive. It would have been a better work if he devoted more time discussing the economic/financial implications of technology and the perceived invasion.However, he did raise some very good and interesting points about the idea of transparency and its applications in an ""open"" society. He also nicely pointed out the contradictions in the logic of pro-encryption and libertarian groupies.Overall, it's a good and thought provoking read."
4,Interesting but disorganized,I bought the book after reading about it in _New Scientist_ (British science journal). Brin's ideas are fascinating but the book could use some serious editing. I'd still recommend it.
5,AMAZING,I was searching for orchestrated traditional hymns and then I came across with this recording. Knowing all hymns in this recording and based in the previous review I decided to order it. This recording is amazing and have fantastic arrangements for orchestra. I recommend it if you enjoy uplifting and good music.
5,fun book to use,Great book. lots of things to try. any new use for photos is always welcome to me. try it you will like it
5,Very creative,Very creative ideas. I saw this book years ago and found it again and glad it's still around.
2,Complicated,"I tore the advertisement for this book out of a magazine 8 years ago and hung onto it. One day I would buy it and make marvelous things with all my pictures. When it arrived in the mail, I held my breath. To my dismay, I found unless you have tons of time on your hands, you won't be making ""cool things"" with your pictures. It was much more involved and complicated than I thought it would be. I was thoroughly disappointed. Maybe when I retire...."
5,LOVED this book!!!,"This is a fantastic book!! I am an avid photography nut! and I love to be able to use my photos in a creative way!! I can't wait to try some of these ideas!! Great color photos, etc."
4,4 wheeling in the snow,Very satisfied with these gloves. I like the wrist string so I can take them off to use my fingers then they are right there when your ready to put them back on. They also fit over your jacket sleeve. Fingers stay warm. Thumb on the right hand got a little cold due to pushing the 4 wheeler throttle for so long.
5,no dejen de verla!!,La película esta muy bien hecha y el mensaje es hermoso. De verdad deja una gran influencia en la forma de pensar y vivir la vida. No dejen de verla y también Karol 1
1,i still have not recieved this item. i am very dissappointed,i have been waiting for this item for over a month. it supposedly was lost in the mail and was reordered on the 17th of march and i still dont have it. i wont order from amazon ever again
3,Like Errol Morris..with spooky puppets!,"I was a very big fan of Jessica Yu's Henry Darger biopic ""In The Realms Of The Unreal"", where I thought her lyrical animation of Darger's outsider art world fit the subject matter perfectly. Here, I just found the puppetry and moody music irritating. The stories of the four men are intriguing, but they're crammed into an awkward ""art house"" assembly. I would have preferred the film without the pretentiousness."
3,Overall a good book with some problems.,"Overall, the book does a great job of covering the many areas of System Safety. It is the best book I've found on the topic.However, this year I started teaching from this book. And when you teach you really discover the shortcomings of a text. It is frustrating when the author uses acronyms without explaination. I've also been running into minor math errors or oversights in formulas (e.g. defining a function f(x) and using 't' in the equation as the independent variable).I think the attempt to cover all of the material resulted in a brief overview of these areas and took away from the quality of coverage. Still, I haven't seen a better book on the topic and if the worst you can say is that it could have been better, thats not bad."
3,Decent executive level intro,"While starting to show its age, Moriarty's text is a sound introduction to the executive-level or program manager as to what his safety guys are doing, why they hold up his schedule and why he pays them so much.For the supervised safety practitioner the text introduces common concepts but doesn't really do modern, embedded control systems justice.The text is expensive and not what I would consider value for money."
4,Works well but...,"just make sure you're intended use is NOT smaller gauge (less than 20 AWG) Teflon coated wire. The Teflon insulated wire is just too ""slippery"" for the clamp to hold on to. Works really well for everything else I've used it on."
4,Great product,"I have a lot of Neiko product due to it being price economical. With the stripper overall its a great product but sometimes you have to try 2 or 3 times for it to actually strip, but this was on heavy duty 12/14 gauge single core wire, so this might be the reason."
4,Nifty Tool - Works Great,"I am an amatuer (not a professional). At the time of this review, I had only used this product for one wiring project (stripping wires for connecting an aftermarket car stereo harness). This tool made the stripping job a breeze. The tool works as advertised. In general, the construction of the product is good and the lever system works great in reducing the pressure needed in the palm of your hand. They do call it ""pro-grade""... not sure if they really mean it is for professionals. Will the tool continue to perform the same way if used very frequently? Only time will tell..."
4,Work Great,"These wire strippers were a godsend during my latest home theatre installation. I'm very ignorant with tools, so I could have used directions (none whatsoever are included), but even I figured it out without too much trouble. They worked great."
4,No instructions - but great time saver,"Luckily I found a video on the web that showed how to use this for wire stripping - as it is not obvious and the product comes with no instructions. But, I'll tell you - as a guy that does a lot of home wiring, this product makes wire stripping fast and accurate - even in confined spaces. It works for all size wires and makes it easy to adjust the amount of wire you want to strip and thus can strip each wire at a consistent length (very useful for applications where the device to be wired ""expects"" a certain length of bare wire - typical with many wall switches). This is a great tool!"
2,a gimmic,"Just like all gimmics out there, the thing barely works for a while and then craps out on you. There is too much going on for this tool to handle. Do yourself a favor and buy a really good pair of wire strippers from a top brand company and you will never have to buy wire strippers again. Or buy this and plan on heading to the store in a few months."
4,Not bad,"Pro: Stripped tons of 20&22 AWG stranded no issues. Love the adjustable length slider. Quick, solid, Cheap (price wise)Crimper end worked great for my gel filled capsCon: The cutter part dented and wore out quickly, Ended up using the cutter on a crimper and some dikes. If the stripped insulation falls into the back, it destroys the insulation on the wire and you need to cut the end off and try again."
4,I really like this stripper,"It has worked properly on every wire I have tried from small 20 gauge to the double coated 12 gauge. The length stop is both handy and easily adjusted. Forget about crimping terminals with it though, the crimp dies are so close to the handle you would need to be a body builder to get them tight enough."
2,Strips smaller wires better than larger ones,"I have a pair of wire strippers that I have used for a while now. But when it came to the 24 AWG CAT5 ethernet, my old ones didn't have a cutout small enough. I bought these to replace my old strippers and then some. However, the thicker the wire, the worse these things do. When stripping ethernet, I have had a 100% success rate. However, getting up to 14-12 AWG, the success rate dwindles to 25% or lower. I have found that it is much less frustrating to just use my old strippers for the larger wires. For small stuff, they do really well. For big stuff, forget it."
4,Cute polo,"The shirt is great. I feel like it ran a little on the small side, but if you are looking for a fitted style shirt it should be fine. It has held up very well and looks great with khakis. Go Vols!!! :)"
5,Very nice earring.,I wanted a perfect hoop earring without a post sticking out the back. This hoop is very comfortable and perfect size. I do not wear earings normally but was able to wear this without taking it off for days. The 3 little diamonds give a very subtle shine which is also very attractive.
5,Class act,This is one of the most brilliantly written discriptions of cryptology I have ever seen.The bit about code purple in WW2 was completely unknown to me.It is all historical though. If qyou want a book on applead cryptography look else where..say [...]
1,Kindle vs. Hardcover,"I purchased the hardcover version of David Kahn's ""The Codebreakers"" several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Today (mid-Dec 2011) I went to Amazon to purchase the Kindle version and found it to be well over $50 and priced higher than the hardcover version. Absolutely insane pricing by the publisher, and another Kindle ebook sale lost for Amazon."
4,Absolutely THE definitive history of Cryptology,".. .Kahn's book was the second book I read on the history of cryptology, Simon Singh's ""The Code Book"" being the first. Without a doubt, you will get the whole knowable history of cryptology in Kahn's book. But don't make the mistake that some other readers obviously did. . .Kahn's book does NOT give a technical explanation of cryptanalysis, nor does he make such a claim. This is a history book pure and simple. If you want a more technical treatment, look up the books in his bibliography.Kahn's book can be tough in some areas, such as the telegraph codes and similar systems, where he seems to keep explaining each individual business codebook or system, but the true cryptography sections are a delight to read. You may want to try Singh's ""The Code Book"", as it is a much easier (and cheaper) read, to see if it piques your interest. Then, do like I did, and devour every crypto book you can find, reading this one second! It truly is an epic work."
2,Not For Programmers,"This was recommended to me as the authoritative and best introduction to cryptography for anyone interested in Encryption. I'm a programmer, and that particular recommendation didn't take my profession into account. Apparently.This is a history book. Sure, I expected to read some historical context. I expected to learn that the first encryption techniques were simple dictionary ciphers. I expected to learn about Da Vinci's reverse writing. I expected to learn about rotating keys and the Enigma machine.But that's not what I found in this book. This book exemplifies why I hated history in school. This is a book for the type of pseudo-intellectual who prefers to learn about people who know something special, rather than learning something special, themselves. Seriously, how can anyone read a book this big about a subject (cryptography) that provides them with absolutely no usable knowledge on that topic. Nothing. Nada. Zip."
1,Poorly written book.,"The prose is terrible. The author has trouble composing sentences, and organizing them into paragraphs. The 'end-notes' are not carefully constructed. Often, it is difficult to ascertain from what source particular information came from."
1,Someone was in quite a rush!,"Apparently, the typesetter lapsed back and forth from english to sanskrit when printing this book. It was obviously done fast and not checked by quality control or anyone else. I have asked for a return. Ridiculous! And $20 for it!"
4,Diamond dazzles,"Peter Diamond, still recovering from his wife's murder the year before, is brought into investigate the death of a young woman found dead on the beach after it was established the young woman was from Diamond's district of Bath. Henrietta Mallin is the original senior-investigating officer in charge of the investigation. In an intertwining mystery, a crossbow wielding serial killer known as "" The Mariner"" (due to leaving clues from ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"") is targeting a known list of celebrities.This is the eight in the Peter Diamond series. I love how with each subsequent book, Diamond's character has developed. Bringing in Hen Mallin is a new catalyst to Diamond's personality. Diamond and Mallin, are both strong personalities must learn to work together. The story was intricately plotted with many twists along the way. My only complaint is that it dragged a bit in the middle of the book. Lovesey has written another winner."
4,The House Sitter by Peter Lovesey,"This was my first Lovesey book, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I truly liked it. Although the book dragged a little in places, it kept me captivated enough to take notes and really try to figure out who had committed the murder. Lovesey got me! This was a great read and definitely has given me the desire to get my hands on more of his books!"
4,good fun!,"The House Sitter is the first novel I've read by Peter Lovesey, and I now look forward to reading more of his work.There's no need to go into the plot (it's summed up already at the top of the page), but I should tell you that the writing is engaging enough to be a real page-turner & literary enough to escape the boring realm of genre mystery.My guesses as to whom the killer might be were totally off, which is exactly what I want from a mystery; the character's(even bit players) had enough charm or creepiness to be more than one-dimensional, and there was just the right amount of humor- allowing the narrative to escape being bogged down by too much death.Recommended!"
1,Would give it NO stars if that were an option,"I purchased this oven 4 months ago and have regetted it almost daily. After burning everything the first month, I thought I could adjust the temp to cook items more evenly. No luck! Because you have to add cooking time to offset for the lower temps, all the food burned anyway. The only thing that I found worked well during my time owning this was the exhaust fan in my kitchen that got a workout EVERY time I cooked....from heating up leftovers to making toast."
1,NO STARS!!Unless you like black toast DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!,I have returned two of these toasters. I thought the first one was just defective when it burned everything unless I stood watch over it. Then the setting dial came apart. The second one was just as bad. Even set on the lightest setting it burned everything. Keep going when you spot this one.
1,Utter Crap,"I can't believe that a company would embarrass itself by selling a product like this. My wife bought it because the inside comes out for easy cleaning. That is it's only redeeming quality. I consistently burns toast, overheats, under heats and the shelves are almost un-adjustable. It's the worst toaster oven I've ever seen."
1,The worst toaster oven I ever owened,"I wanted a better toaster over, but this didn't even come close. It burns everything, the insides come out instead of the rack, and it takes forever to toast anything. I think any toaster over would be better than this one."
1,Toast-Disaster,"Bar none, this is the worst toaster ever built and I have no idea how it ever made it out of the test kitchen. Ignore the variable toast control because there are really only two settings: under-toasted, and burnt. Seriously, you will have better luck toasting bread or bagels over a campfire blindfolded. Avoid at all cost, or purchase it as a wedding present for a couple you detest."
1,not worth giving away,"Because we wanted a 4 slice toaster oven instead of our 2 slice Toastmaster we bought this model thinking it would be the same good quality as the 2 slice Toastmaster we've owned for years.But, the day we plugged it in until we tossed it in the garbagethree weeks later it would not toast. One of the control knobs broke and Toastmaster could not be reached for a replacement.We went back to the two slice Toastmaster from Amazon and again we have good toast!"
1,Italian Mama,"Had to have my son, Guido, mount the door handle twice since I have had it (2 years). Yesterday, I put a small sweet potato in the oven and started it. After about 3-4 minutes, I heard a ""bang"" in the kitchen. Went to find that the glass door had shattered to a million pieces. No smoke, no fire, no damage to the counter top and the potato was barely warm."
4,I liked it ...,"OK, if you ride bikes the first thing you'll notice is the over exaggerated knee to the ground on some turns ... but all in all the roads are sweet and they do really carve a few of em out. The movie makes me feel like jumping on the bike and hitting the not as good roads around here :). They are great riders, and they really capture the riding feel. The sound track is great. I recommend this movie. If ya want a trick vid look elsewhere, but thats the best part. Its not a trick vid; its a riding vid."
2,OK for the Price,"I didn't have problems with only one side at a time working on mine, but I haven't been entirely happy with it. My husband picked this out for the PoP Tart feature, and that is the worst part of the machine. He is a PoP Tart fanatic and this machine is very poorly designed for them. They slide down beside the toast holder things and you can't get them out. Also, if you have the temp. adjuster thing on the Pop Tart setting, they are still cold. Works fine for toast and bagels."
3,poorly constructed,"One of the handles was installed too low on the side of the board and in one day I had a chunk of wood from the bottom of the board in my hand. Other then that, these boards are ok for the price."
1,Not what I was looking for......,My biggest disappointment was that the online description did not accurately describe the contents of the book. I ordered a 'used' copy supposedly in 'excellent' condition. The book I received had considerable handwritten notes in it! When I expressed my total dissatisfaction with the order I was given a total refund which I did appreciate very much.
2,"not good, no sir i dont like it","this is pretty annoying. i regret buying it because it sounds like poo.i thought it would be something else, more mellow but its not. it is repetitive and harsh sounding."
2,Predictable & completely unbelievable,"Well, I'm usually not one to complain about a story being unrealistic. I understand that good fiction often requires a little suspension of reality. But Darkness goes well beyond ""a little"" suspension of reality. This book is unbelievable almost to the point of being funny. I never really got sucked into the story. In part, because although I was able to picture the faces and places, the almost cartoonish story line meant it never seemed real, even in my imagination.That being said, this book isn't horrible. It's average and that's about it. I'd like to give it 2.5 stars, but can't. There's a few twists. Most are pretty easy to see coming, but I don't think Saul was really intending to blindside you with them anyway. The end was a little disappointing, although I read worse."
2,Not Very Scary,"Although Saul is not a great author, his books can often be suspenseful and entertaining. This book, however, is neither suspenseful or entertaining."
3,could have been better,"This is the first J.S. book that I've read. I was rather disapointed from the book. I just couldnt identify with the characters. The plot on the other hand was good, although the ending was rather non complete.... Worth reading if you have nothing better to read."
4,Not bad,"This book was very good although there were times when I had a hard time believing some things that happened like when the ""dark man"" died at the end. There were also a lot of unanswered questions, like what happened to the little girl? Did she come back home? Did she get her youth back? I felt like I got cut off with several chapters missing."
1,"YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT??","TELL ME YOU'RE KIDDING?? C'MON---TELL ME.IT WAS BARELY OKAY---IT WAS BARELY OKAY---IT WAS BARELY OKAY---THEN ON PAGE 232---WHEN THEYSTARTED EATING A PERSON'S THYMUS ((WHAT, NO CRACKER??))--I DREW THE LINE. IT WENT DOWNHILL REAL QUICK AFTER THAT."
2,Not worth the time,"The story seemed forced and came out unnaturally. The premise was an interesting, but I found my mind wandering. The characters were not engaging at all! Also, their actions often seemed to come out of no where, with hardly any follow up. The beginning of the novel overall was too cutesy and corny for words. The ending was a bit better, but still didn't make up for the first portion. I'm glad I've done reading it, so I can move on to something more interesting and better written!"
3,A traditional artist story,"A traditional story of an artist inspired by beautiful woman happened being a prostitute in London-1731, his family relations and consequently fathering a fruit of love.Semi-documentary depicting passionate sex scenes and a general spirit of then England a bit coloured with electronic gadgets more recently."
3,Good Value,"The leatherette is top grade - and the fit good.However, it is NOT exactly custom fit for a 2005 Nissan Frontier SE as advertised and ordered. The side flaps on the buckets for side-airbags (that don't exist) is minor - But the lack of provision for the passenger bucket's exterior outside fold-down mechanism makes installation difficult. The fastening system with respect to the seat's mechanics (underside bars and springs, clip clearances, etc.) was not thought out very well either."
3,Bacon Tray,"I thought this would be a great replacement for an old tray I've had for years, but my husband say's it to small and doesn't cook as well as the old one."
5,great,"This nordic sloped bacon tray is idea for my family of two. We don't prepare a lot of bacon strips and the tray fit perfectly into our microwave oven. An added plus, it's easy to clean."
4,Love it!,"A really small tray for a smallish microwave. This is one of the only ones that would turn in my microwave. Works great, but would be too small for many."
3,Expensive but effective although too narrow,"This thing works as advertised and does a good enough job at microwaving bacon and draining the fat. No fundamental problems. But it is too narrow to put a slice on without bunching it up. That being said, after the bacon cooks and shrinks, it fits on the tray and turns out fine. My main objection is to the regular price of over $13. That's a bit steep for a piece of grooved plastic. I paid well under $10 on a lightning deal. At that price, I can live with the fact that the tray is a bit narrow since it otherwise works fine. It loses one star for the narrowness, and one star for the too-high price."
3,review of Appalachian Paradise,"The story was exciting, had a good plot, and was believeable. I thought the sex was overdone...not realistic."
2,Predictable...DITTO,"I was going to write a longer review but then I read the review by Sue Lit-Fan ""Sue."" I agree totally with everything she wrote so there is no reason to repeat; so I will just say DITTO."
3,Disappointing for this reader,"After seeing all the 5 star ratings for this book, I not only ordered it immediately, I paid more for it to be shipped than what it cost. For the purposes I was looking for, it was a disappointment. I am in the process of writing a book proposal and I got the impression from the reviews that there would be samples for me to look at, and there was very little. I needed to have examples. The book proposal section was skimpy and too general. It added nothing to what I already knew. It would have helped if I could have seen on the page more samples of what an overview looks like, or an outline. The first half of the book was good in that it talked about the spiritual aspects of being a writer. I enjoyed that. But the proposal part, which was what caused me to buy the book, was not what I was looking for."
5,Spiritual/Metaphysical/New-Age CopyWriting Gold,"While working on my Query letter for Ancient Astral Gemstones & Talismans II, I've read and reviewed 3 different books on Query Writing. The information in this book is better than gold for trying to find the right Agent to publish this book. In addition to excellent advice, the book has a wealth of Literary Agents and Publishers who specialize in precisely the type of book I need to publish. None of the other CopyWriting books or articles I've read to date can compare with it."
1,"Horrible digital edition, no table of contents!?",This is a 1320 page digital book with NO TABLE OF CONTENTS!?Do not waste your money!
5,Raw Punk!!!,"This is one of the best albums from AGT, dont bother getting Where the Sun never sets. Comparing them, What the F will change is the best out of the two."
5,Love It,"I love this album. i bought it expecting an unseen album, but i was wrong. A global threat has a much diffrent sound. They are generally more raw and in your face well being a little more all round catchy. This meaning that all there songs are catchy, even though none are as much as social security, are we dead yet or punks attack. The album is an all around scream along album. Get it. If you like it pick up the unseen's lower class crusifixion, so this is freedom, singles collection. Also get the casualties early years, and punx attack. Make sure to get the virus's still fighting for a future, and blanks 77 killer blanks. These are all great street punk bands along the same lines as this."
4,Good ep release,"if you like the unseen you will these guys, probably because mark unseen is in the band. Their sound is a little more harder than the unseen and straight to the point. This is a great ep and i hope to see alot more from this band in the future."
3,Guardsman plots along...,"This album is a fun look at the behind the curtains lives of two actors who fall in love. Jealousy begins and so does the tomfoolery. The music is very catchy and light. There isn't one hit song that stands out, and I didn't find that there is a real climax point. But it is fun. Lots of the music sounds very similar."
3,Enter The Guardsman!! rest :(,"It's really too bad this has selections from 3ree and Red Red Rose on it. They're really quite bores. But, until someone records the full score of the delightful Enter The Guardsman, I'm stuck with just the few tantalizing selections available on this CD."
5,like the finest of wine,"Robbie Robertson is a phenomenon...he just keeps getting better and better...musically growing and breaking new ground. It's one of the things that makes this documentary so fascinating, to see the development from the early days to the present, ending as it does with a marvelous live performance of ""Ghost Dance"".The musical clips are treasures. The moments with Willie Dixon, Bob Dylan (looking like a teenager), a few selections from ""The Last Waltz"", etc. He's also an expressive and eloquent interview subject...to hear him talk about his youth with Ronnie Hawkins, Dylan writing his songs on a typewriter, and so much more.A great story teller, with subtle wit and sharp observations, he looks like a Native American Gary Cooper, long, lean and comfortable...with relaxed body language and a voice that's so easy on the ears, making this an incredibly entertaining and enjoyable 70 minutes, spent watching and hearing pure genius."
5,"Classic,","What a joy! Incredible history and roots. Robbie is not only the consummate story teller from the Band and his solo albums, he's also a pleasure to listen to speak about the history of the Band, their involvement with Bob Dylan, Martin Scorsesse and Eric Clapton and more. There is some incredible archival footage of Dylan playing with the Band from the Basement Tapes era, a great dialog segment between Robbie and Scorsesse about the making of the Last Waltz and a not so trivial Rock N Roll trivia revelation from Eric Clapton that he broke up Cream after hearing the Band and then asked Robbie if he could join. WOW. If you're a Band, Dylan fan or just love good documentaries do not miss this!"
3,A beginers intro to a historic band that changed rock,"This release was informative and also included a few live clips of Robbie as a solo artist.It delves further into the makings of the Hawks with early photos of the boys as they were acquired from other bands.Unfortunately there was no older interview footage of Richard Manuel to really complete the general feeling of the Band portion of the documentary.I felt that a portion of ""The Band"" dvd could have been combined into ""Going Home"" to make a good release even better.This is a good follow up to the hopefull impending release of ""The Last Waltz"" on dvd."
2,Good old footage; bad new footage,"This DVD is worth a glimpse for the old film of the Band & a very young Bobby Dylan, but it's hard to take the 90s version of Robbie Robertson seriously when he has that ridiculous piece on his head. Depressing viewing indeed. Wow, how has his hair stayed so brown when all his contemporaries are gray? Incredible!More importantly, his post-Band music is not much chop (it's embarrassing, actually) and he comes across as incredibly vain, single-handedly taking credit for all The Band's music. Still, he has some interesting turns of phrase and the interviews aren't bad.Far better is Levon Helm's autobiography ""This Wheel's On Fire"" (1556524056)"
1,Buy History of My Life Vol. 1-2 if you want the real Casanova,"Just like most people looking at this book, I grabbed it because I didn't think there would be any difference between this version and the unabridged version. I was dead wrong. This version is abridged, and is almost completely censored. So if you're looking for racy tales about Casanova's exploits with the fairer sex, you will be very, very disapointed. In fact, if you're looking for any evidence of Casanova's cleverness, his wit, his great writing style, or awesome storytelling ability, you will not find it here at all! However, the book ""History of My Life"", which is the completely uncensored translation of the book by William Trask is a gem. Not only does it have all of the exploits that make Casanova,well, Casanova, but it also lets us see him for who he truly was: a Renaissance man (arguably a genius) who had one hell of a libido."
4,Funny!,"I found the book delightful. Not so much all of Casanova's exploits, they became a bit boring in time, but the descriptions of life around him, the rentals of houses, rooms, parlors, the modes of transportation, the meetings with others, the management of money, they were told splendidly and believably. The now so popular movie can't do justice to the story told in the book. Even the advertisements are bad. No one ever called Casanova a ""pig.""For anyone who likes to explore living situations of any class of people in the past, this is a great book."
2,men can be such nice people,"well this essentially an exceprt from the much larger story of my life. it is essentially the autobiography of a self-absorbed ladies man. womanizing, debauchery and what seems to me to be pure boasting fills the book. i found it to be ok but definately felt i could have been doing something better than reading this."
3,training,secretaries are now called administrative professionals. One should not undervalue any job - page 286 - those who do this job know that it is very valued. Will have to re-read this book as it has interesting undertones.
1,Horrible,"Maybe I'm not ""literary"" enough, but I read this book and did not get it. I thought it was just the worst book I have ever read. I would rather read a college textbook! What was the point of it all? I thought the characters never developed into anything. I would only recommend this book to people who had trouble sleeping at night. It will put you to sleep in a minute."
3,do you like stream of consciousness?,"Put this on the shelf next to Ulysses. It's sort of a parallel universe to that style, loosely speaking. But the other similarity is that it is fairly hard to read. If you read A LOT, then probably you will really enjoy this book. If you just want something that gets to the point, don't read this. It may be the best example of a novelist with ""misinformation"" as an intent. By that I mean that trickery and deception are part of the writing itself, and Barnes is really good with prose- it's likened to poetry for a reason. Still, I'm left unsatisfied."
1,Hate,I had to get this book for my english class. If it wasn't required for the class then I wouldn't have bought it. It was just not my cup of tea. It was way too much like Shakespeare but more confusing.
2,Baffling - would like to hear from others,"Nightwood recently appeared high on the list of the top 100 lesbian and gay novels. A friend and I decided to read the book together so as to discuss it as we went along. We are both baffled at its reputation as one of the greatest pieces of prose ever written, as neither of us is able to appreciate either its characters or the meaning of its poetic writing, however profound it may seem to be. I would love to hear from other readers - what do you love about it and understand it to be about? Nightwood has proved a msytery to me."
2,For cat lovers only,"The book contains short stories of varying quality. The title gives the impression that the collection deals with crimes solved by cats. This, however, is not usually true, although a cat plays a major role in each story. Two of the stories were outstanding and would hold their own as good literature. They were: ""The Death Cat of Hester Street,"" by Carol Gorman and ""Byron"" by Jack Albert. Cat lovers will love the book, for it was written with cat lovers in mind"
2,This waffle iron falls apart,"Boy was I delighted for a couple of months with this waffle iron. But as time passed, the temperature knob fell off. I was able to push it back in place and it worked for a while, but then the indicator light no longer worked and now I can't even get the iron to heat up. What a really big disappointment and it sure ain't inexpensive. I am about to buy a new iron for 19.99. This is what I should have done in the first place."
5,searching for Death Valley Days TV series video by D Whitcom,"Help..looking for the follwing DV Days shows Shanhi Kelly's Bithday, Otherside of the Mountain,Let My People Go, The Firebrand, Gypsy,..Any help in locating these would be appreciated. e mail me @ momnayture@aol.com THANKS"
5,Wacky Wednesday,What a great book! I look forward to sharing it with my grandchildren for Christmas.
5,Wacky Wednesday,"Wacky WednesdayTheo LeSiegReading Level 1.2Wacky Wednesday is a great book for younger children! I would really recommend it! The illustrations are wonderful, bright, funny and very cute! Wacky Wednesday is a very good book for finding and helping children to look for different objects. It is really quite fun trying to find the things that are wacky!!"
5,Wacky Wednesday,"This book is clever and interesting. It was a favorite of mine and my siblings when we were young. In this book, wacky things continue to happen as the day goes on. On this Wednesday one little boy is the only one who realizes that things are not as they should be. Wacky Wednesday is a book that i recommend anyone to read to a small child, they will truelly enjoy it."
3,Wacky Wednesday,"This book is about a very Wacky Wednesday, where a kid wakes up and finds weird and different out side and in his room, so he went outside and asked some people what's wrong they said the only thing that is wrong is you, they said you have to find 20 things wrong and then he could go back to sleep.The lesson in Wacky Wednesday is how to count, and to see what's wrong with the picture.The age level for this book is 4-8.I thought the book was very good."
2,New Illustrations Needed,"They need to get a new version done with a better illustrator. The ""wacky"" bits are highly repetitive, and many are difficult to put into words. For example, there are many instances of some type of creature or critter holding up a table or refrigerator leg. There are also numerous examples of sections of trees or poles missing. And finally there are too many creepy examples of body parts missing from poorly drawn people. It could be a great book with a better, and more creative, illustrator."
3,For decoration only,I have several of these in red and amber. The light output isn't as good as competing incandescent side markers. The viewing angle is not as good as most incandescent side markers. The tiny size is a problem as would take very little dirt or snow to block. The plastic is thick enough that it should hold up to moderate abuse. I would not trust them to survive off road use. One advantage is that these use 68 mA at 12V. For use at nominal 24v I use 200 ohm 1 watt resistor in series.
2,CUTE,HARD TO WEAR THEY DONT STAY ON MY FEET. SO NEEDLESS TO SAY FOR ME IT WAS WASTED MONEY. WALKING IN THEM IS IMPOSSIBLE
5,adidas slides,"these shoes ar great, they are comfortable and they look great. the price was just as wonderful. amazon has suc great deals."
3,Limited functionality with ipod classic or 3rd gen nano,"Rated at 3 stars because of Apple, not Kenwood.New ipod classics and 3rd gen nano's have new video encryption that requires a ""chipped"" cable to work properly for video output. So where this cable is made to be all-in-one plug and play, it won't work for the newest ipods.Not Kenwoods fault, and they might make some firmware updates on some radios to fix this. But for now it is broken and requires said firmware fix or possibly a new cable model.Presumably fine for older ipods, but new users should be aware of the video problems.My personal case involves a 3rd gen nano and a dnx7100 head unit. Audio is buggy (freezing w/no response - requiring a reset of the nano) and video gives instant freeze."
1,doesnt works with my iphone 4 and my ipod..,"nothing, doesnt works, ive been conectc, and nothing, no detected my iphone and ipod x, x, x, =:::::( i lost my money!"
4,Good cable - mediocre price,"I tried to purchase a similar 30 pin to USB/3.5mm from monoprice.com and seeing as they were out relegated myself to purchasing this one instead. It's a good cable although I use it to run audio from my iPhone to my aux-in head unit and power it via a USB charger. It works well for this, but two gripes; one is that the cable is still bent where it was in the packaging which is unsightly, and two it shows a warning when plugging in that the accessory wasn't made for an iPhone and may cause interference. It hasn't in my case, but if that's a concern be aware."
4,Only one thing wrong.....,"I'm not sure if it's the cable or my ipod but for some reason I cant play any of my videos to my Kenwood sterio system. I have updated everything but still no video so I'm giving this 4 stars, other than that it works pretty good."
5,perfect,this is a good cabol for kenwood DVD reciever. it's connect the iPod with the reciever to show all video and listen all music from iPod with full controlling from reciever.
3,Another not sure!,"I am not going to slam this connector because I did connect my Ipod to it. The head unit said ""no Ipod connection"". However, I had just gotten my new Ipod, and it had zero songs on it. So, if you do not have songs, I wouldn't expect your head unit to register any Ipod. Now, I have songs, but have removed the entire system due to a changing of vehicles. Thus, I am not sure how well this little cable works. Good luck!"
5,Adorable AND Educational,"I was fortunate enough to catch this program on HBO Family recently and my two children, 2 and 5, both LOVED it. Now that we have the DVD it's on non-stop, which is actually fine by me as the score is quite pleasant, and the puppies are simply adorable. What a fabulous way to introduce my children to classical music. We are all eager for the next batch of puppy fun!"
5,Watch that stream!,"I ordered it and got just what was described. I love this thing! For the price you cannot beat it. I went out this past weekend and put this tube to the test. Both me and my buddy are pretty big guys (6'-2"" and around 230lbs) and it held up great. Its durability is probably because of the construction. It has a tube covered by a denier jacket. The only warning I would have is watch that water stream. It'll get you right in the jewels if you are a grown man. Definitely did not prepare for that... especially when my friends launched up to 45mph on our first trial."
1,jean driscoll,the product sent to me was different than the one shown in the picture. It turns out you at Amazon had 2 different products listed with the same order number. The wrong product was sent to me and it was very frustrating because we were leaving in 2 days for vacation and supposedly there was nothing you would do to resolve the problem in that short period of time. very upsetting and will probably never order anything from Amazon.com again!
1,The picture is not what you get!!!!,"I ordered this and instead of what was pictured, I got another product with a hole in the center for a rider to sit. Worst part is I paid express shipping and Amazon did not give a shipping refund (even though it was promised)- what a rip off"
4,Drama Queen,"I adore Zarah Leander and her transvestite looks and manners. The western love and hate for far away cultures is divinely pictured here. For romantics, conosseurs and dilettantes. Refined kitsch at its best"
3,Showgirl School,"This book had some useful information about making over dolls. The hair curling section was helpful. The face painting chapter was very detailed, but even though she says she doesn't like beginners to use watercolors, that's what she demonstrates in the book. So you are warned to follow her instructions very carefully. The costume design chapter was strange but interesting. She's making a showgirl and the entire costume consists of a tiny little panty that she cuts out and hand-sews together, and some ribbon that she winds around the bosom and stitches to the bottom. She covers all the raw edges with sequins and beads. She even glues some pieces to the doll itself, so when she says ""one-of-a-kind"" dolls, she means exactly that. Don't expect to make a costume that you could put on a different doll. The sections on beading and making a display box were new to me, so overall I did learn some new tricks."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book and then turned around and got rid of it. Very disappointing to me. A word to the editor: spelling and grammar matter. There were consistent misspellings, such as ""seperate,"" and ""it's"" for the possessive ""its."" That's just shoddy and there's no reason for it--this is a formal publication, not an exercise for English Comp I. As to the content of the book, I was less than thrilled to see that the author had merely painted over the existing facial screening of the doll rather than removing the original paint and starting from scratch. And pardon me, but not everyone is into the ""Vegas showgirl"" look, which was the only fashion this book showcased. Very limiting. Overall an amateur effort."
5,Excellent source book for beginners!!!,(...)I wanted to leave one here as well to tell everyone that I think this is a great book and I recommend it highly. I am a male in the field and have been taunted by my friends because I love to design for fashion dolls. The author makes me feel like this is not a 'women's only' hobby but that everyone can take part and become successful in it. I really like the layout of the book. The language is simple and easy and I've been waiting for a book like this for a long time. Thank you!!
1,If there were negative #'s I give it that rating,"I feel totally ripped off this is the worse book ever. First it should be doll. She only makes one doll. There is just no words for how horrible this book is and I buy alot of books this is by far the worst. PLEASE DON""T WASTE YOUR HARD EARN MONEY!!! SURF THE INTERNET !!!I rarely give bad reviews but this must be said"
3,Helpful Tips,"This book has some very helpful tips and procedures, she is a great artist for her recreations of dolls like Serenity Angel and Rhiannon, but the one she has on the cover, that she used throughout the book, looks like a transvesdyke - terribly unfemminine. The doll she chose has genitalia(not a Mattel) - completly disgusting, but still she's a good artist when she puts her skills to GOOD use."
5,Information I never knew,"The new book by Sabrina Giudice, ""Creating Fashion Dolls"", is the most informative start to finish explanation for OOAK designers in the industry. If you are a beginner or a seasoned professional there is much to learn here. Her descriptions of fixing hair and perms were easy to understand. Information on repaints and paints to use, right down to brush size, and use of appropriate blush is extremely useful. Also, if you hand sew or machine stitch your own designs, she gives you examples of looking at fashion in a new light. This is a MUST for serious doll designers and ones thinking they would like to attempt this type of art. Highly recommended."
1,Bombed Blonde,"Had I been able to see really look through this book before purchasing, I would not have spent my money. I believe even beginners would appreciate more in depth coverage on costuming than what was provided.The only ""hand sewn"" items were the panties and the strap around the neck, both with raw edges. The rest of the items were purchased and glued. I have found better information on both costuming and makeup on internet sites. Needless to say, I found this book disappointing."
1,Not worth the money,"This book covers very little that is helpful in the world of fashion doll makeovers. It does nothing about repainting techniques, only ""enhancements,"" which means changing the color a bit. It also uses colored pencils and those do not work on all fashion dolls. Other questionable techniques are presented. The end result is a ""Vegas showgirl,"" but so little is learned and so much of it is wrong or ill-advised. A beginner will be more messed up by following it than helped."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!!,"I must admit, I almost became swayed when I read the last few reviews of this book. I'm SO glad that I didn't though. I don't understand how anyone can say that this book is not a resource God for beginners! The book is extremely well written aside from some grammatical errors on the part of the publisher - and as someone else in the reviews said, it is more teaching than advertising. Sabrina uses a very friendly approach and starts off this first book with just the basics so that a beginner like me can get a feel of painting and sewing very minimally and still creating something exotic, glittery and gorgeous. I wouldn't part with the book personally. I've come up with a thousand and one ideas just from looking through the pages. Definetally worth the money!"
5,Very interesting,"This is a very interesting book. It throws yet more light on the richness of Tolkien's mind and learning, and of the world he created. Plainly this is a mine from which much treasure is yet to be dug!To compliment it I would recommend Hal GP Colebatch's ""Return of the Heroes."" This looks at Tolkien's relevance to modern mythologies."
5,Better than Slowdive!,"If you're like me and wish Slowdive/Mojave 3's former frontman Neil Halsted would stop trying to be Nick Drake and go back to composing the beautifully crafted pop we came to enjoy back in the early 90s, Monster Movie is for you. Monster Movie includes Slowdive's Christian Savill and pretty much continues where the legendary British band left off. This is truly dreampop and shoegaze at its absolute finest. Last Night Something Happened was my favorite album of 2002 and still one of my all-time favorites.HIGHLY recommended for fans of Slowdive, Mahogany, Ride and Chapterhouse!"
3,Not what I expected!,"When I bought this I expected it to be much thicker and have alot more information! The cover posted here is wrong too! If you love Trigun, you'll like this book but if you're not really into it, then I don't think you should buy this! (Save it for a cel or use it on the episode sceries!) .. Also, when this book arrived to me, the cover was scratched and had dirt on it. Don't get me wrong, it was packaged nicely, but the book was beaten up and if you asked me, I think I'd like to be the one who damages the book!"
5,High schools should have a copy for students to view!,"If you want convincing evidences for evolution, this DVD set is it. I watched it over and over again. The DVD about the Dover Pennsylvania trial on Intelligent Design is also a excellent walkthrough of the flaws and fallacies about intelligent design, and convincing evidences of evolution - both as a fact and a well supported scientific theory. High schools should have a copy for students to view!"
4,Book for my wife,I bought these for my wife. These were replacing some books that had belonged to her mother and just were worn out. These are older books you just can't fing in stores. She was thrilled to get them back again. The price was excellent. The delivery was quick.
5,The enclosed CD alone is worth the price!,This book contains the MODOFC software package and associated documentation that implements many of the methods described in the book. Very worthwhile.I especially appreciated that each chapter ended with a summary of selected references and brief histories of the methodologies presented in the book.
1,So boring I couldn't finish it....,"This was truly the most boring book I have ever tried to read. I usually have a trick where I skip to the next chapter and start reading to try to reinterest myself in the book. I tried this SEVERAL times and it didn't work. I expected to really like the book, and was totally disappointed....."
4,E-Space nemesis returns,"I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first in the new series. One of the Time Lord's oldest and greatest enemies resurfaces in San Francisco and Sam and the Eighth Doctor rush to stop a possibly disastrous confrontation between UNIT and a newly discovered Vampire cell. A lot of this book is spent giving you an impression of the Doctor's new personality, both through his statements and Sam's observations of him. Is he a pacifist that will do anything to find a peaceful solution, or is he simply trying to hold back a violent desire to destroy a threat to the universe. There are interesting characters in this book, but at times the story seemed forced around an attempt to flesh out the new Doctor's personality. Still a good read, but not as riveting as most others in the series."
3,FAIR PIECE OF WORK TO THE DR. WHO LIBRARY,"Ok, I liked Vampire Science, in so far as that it was an easy read, and the 8th Doctor continues to be well developed, as well as Sam. She finally gets her character well fleshed out, and the Doctor is shown as a more compassionate, ""touchy feely"" persona than any previous incarnation. Carolyn is also well done. What's not right about this book? The plot. It's fine and all, but seems to wander, as though not quite sure of where it's going next. I'd really give this book 2 1/2 stars if I could...lightweight reading that shines through the Doctor and Sam's development."
1,Utterly Horrid,"Kate Orman should've quit after her first book, for the quality of her work has become steadily worse with each new book - ultimately presenting us with this unimaginative and very tedious mess that doesn't have any remnants left from the show we once loved. This book is on the reading level of an eight year old, for it's pure childish fantasy - what happened to Dr Who being a sci-fi series?"
1,Pretty Bad!!!!!!!!,"I've got something to say to whoever wrote this book! I don't care about other side characters you create!!!! I bought the book for the Doctor!!! The Main problem with this book is that too much time is spent on some lady the author creates (which she probably modeled after herself), and the Doctor is treated more like the side character!!Don't waste your money, there are better books out there!!!"
4,Educational and fascinating,I must admit that I don't know as much about WWII as I should. This book really focused on the persecution of the Jewish people during that time. The author focuses on interweaving fact and artistic writing to get a very powerful message accross. The depravity of humanity and how other nations just looked the other way. I was really angry and I wanted a riot after reading this book. I was wonderfully written and it is obvious that the author was passionate about the topic and the research. I highly suggest reading this book.
5,great value,I paid less than $10 for this trimmer including shipping. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. This trimmer replaced another one made by another company that starts with W. There is no comparison. This is well worth the money and would buy another in a heartbeat.
2,Inferior trimmer that doesn't last,"It's a flimsy plastic trimmer that doesn't have any good qualities aside from the cheap price tag. You're better off spending an extra $5 on ""MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer"" here on Amazon. My husband hasn't had any complaints with that one so far."
1,Who Cut the Cheese? Not Panasonic,"This thing could not cut a single hair. First we tried the nose, then the ears, then the arm then the twigs and berries.......it was as if the blade was missing......complete POS......my old Panasonic device worked well for years......sad to say this is the first Panasonic product that I have ever bought that has not lived up to the name."
1,Trimmer fails to trim.,"This product is an embarrassment to the brand.Installed a brand-new Duracell battery in a brand-new trimmer and attempted to trim for a solid two minutes. This effort resulted in no appreciable impact.I specifically and repeatedly targeted a particularly irksome offender, using every conceivable angle of attack, throughout which it stubbornly and valiantly resisted the so-called blade.I should add that while it fails to trim anything, the device does in fact result in sensations that cannot be called pleasurable as it pulls on your nose hairs in futility.In case this is not enough to dissuade you from making this purchase, the device also produces an unpleasant and potentially harmful ozone smell."
5,18+ years or more now,"I think I bought my first ER112BC trimmer in 1990, and sometime around last December it stopped working. Recently I replaced it through Amazon. In the interim, from Brookstone I purchased a more expensive trimmer that had very high consumer ratings. It did not perform nearly as well as the Panasonic. I read some negative reviews of the Panasonic here prior to buying another and did not understand how anyone could have anything bad to say about it, especially if the user has experience with more expensive models. I will never switch again, there is no need. The Panasonic is very effective, long-lasting, easy to clean, uses very few batteries over its life, shaves nose hairs very cleanly (the more expensive model did not shave nearly as close to the hair root nor did it reach all areas reached by the Panasonic), does not cause injuries to skin. Can't say enough good things about it."
4,Fragile But Efficient,"A nose trimmer is not a complicated piece of machinery, but is a necessary one. Using clippers or scissors just doesn't make it and you risk infection. This device has tiny surgical stainless-steel blades and runs fast and smooth. No pinching and no discomfort. It is a bit touchy to clean as the central shaft and blades once out rather easily for cleaning under tap water. I could easily see losing a piece down the drain. But for a small, lightweight and packable `nose and ear' trimmer, it does the job and it's not that expensive. I'll be the first to admit that nose trimmers are not sexy, but neither are nose hairs!Battery not included. Also, when I first got my trimmer, the ON/OFF button wouldn't turn off. I returned it and was given a new one within a week."
2,This toy just can't cut it,"The family convinced me it was time to trim my nose hairs, so I purchased this Panasonic personal grooming device. It is compact, runs on a single AA battery, comes apart for cleaning, uses stainless steel blades, and seems safe to use.Unfortunately, it does not cut nose hairs. It vibrates, tickles, and twirls them around, but too often fails to actually trim them off. In addition, the non-replaceable blade is designed to wear out after about two years of use.There must be better products on the market.Note: My experience is with the ER115KC version of this product, which is a washable variation of the ER112BC product."
1,It will NOT change your life! You can pay too little.,"I purchased this thing over a year ago from Amazon. You people LIED to me! I'm shopping for a replacement! Seriously though, it has some problems: 1. The switch doesn't make very good contact, so you end up switching it on and off a few times to get it to start. 2. It's underpowered, so it starts up kind of slow, and you wonder if it is up to the task. One AA battery isn't enough. 3. The cutters seem cheap and don't trim very closely. 4. Overall sound and feel is cheesy. This is NOT a precision instrument."
1,Panasonic Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer,"Don't let the name Panasonic fool you. This is a cheap toy. Mine got slower and slower, fresh batteries made little difference. It didn't even last a year. Spend a little more and get a better one.E.L."
5,"Works great, small and portable, and lasts for years.","I must admit that my son hated the one I bought for him. He probably didn't use it right. Just inserting it into a nostril and moving it around doesn't cut it (pun intended). Instead, turn it on and insert it about 1/4 inch into the nostril, then out, then in, etc., focusing on each area you want to trim. You can tell when its done trimming an area by the change in pitch.The cutter head comes apart easily for cleaning. I oil the cutter with a drop of light oil, such as baby oil, after each use."
1,This thing does not work,"It does make noise, but I could not find any cut hairs. Even when I tried to make it cut a specific hair it did not work. In the end I had to get the scissors and tweezer out."
2,Stops working after a short period of time,"This item worked well for a month or so, but then began working intermitently after that. Eventually it stopped working all together. In my opinion it is a pretty cheaply made item. I would not recommend it."
3,Not as good as the older model,"Panasonic ER112BC Nose and Ear TrimmerNot as good as the older model, but still works a lot better then Remington or others. Still better then the sissor method ""OUCH"""
3,You get what you pay for,Cheap - but works with a bit of fiddling around.Good size for travelling.I would probably buy a more expensive model next time.
3,Panasonic ER112BC,"Great little product. Although it rattles a little when you turn it on, it works well."
5,best nose/ear trimmer ever,"years ago, i bought this nose hair trimmer for my husband. it's awesome. however, eventually it finally broke and a part went missing. we have purchased 5 different, and some very expensive trimmers since that never matched up to this one. my husband was thrilled when he finally found his ""original"" trimmer. still works great, don't waste your money on more expensive models."
5,Panasonic Trimmer,"My husband had one of these trimmers for several years. After it finally died we went to several local stores looking for the exact same one, our search was futile. I finally looked on Amazon and found it. Now his regular grooming is back to normal and he is exceptionally pleased. I probably should buy a couple more so he will not be without again. Think I will wait a couple of months first."
2,Surprised,"Ordered this ear and nose trimmer to replace my panasonic trimmer. Looks like my old panasonic trimmer. Though the speed seems the same as my old trimmer it just doesnt do the same job. For some reason it takes so much longer to get results. I ended up buying a micro touch max made in china at walmart , It works better than any trimmer I ever had and is more versitile."
4,"not amazing, but gets it done",There is nothing really to rave about this. It cuts the hairs and it nice and compact. I'd buy it again.
4,It serves its purpose...,"I bought it for under $10, and it works - that's a great bang for my buck.It takes a few runs in each nostril to get everything trimmed, and it starts smelling like oiled-metal as you use it (naturally - it IS lodged up in your nose), but the family notices it trimmed well. I'm happy with the purchase."
3,Fine,"I have used this item a couple of times now. It works fine. If you have the jungles of Estonia sweeping out of your nostrils then go buy a weedwacker, otherwise, shell out the 8 bucks this thing costs and throw it in your dopp kit and then check it off the list. That is all."
1,Discusthing,"I never got to use the trimmer. The motor doesn't work even after buying new batteries, and the cutting head looks like it's been smashed.It's not worth the postage or trouble to return it,so it just lays in the drawer."
5,Panasonic nose clipper,"The nose clipper is wonderful. I highly recommend it to others. It works well, is a small, convenient size and the price was more than reasonable."
1,Not as good as it once was,"I had this model, or at least it looked the same, for a few years and it worked exceptionally well. It finally broke down recently and I thought I was lucky enough to find it again, but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all. Actually, it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done, which, of course is like not having it done at all!"
1,Defective,Did not work! Had to send it back for exchange! No response yet after two weeks!!Crap crap crap crap crap. Crap crap crap crap
1,nose hair trimmer,"The price was cheap, but it was a poor quality nose hair trimmer. The nose hair trimmer only lasted two month."
2,Not as good as before,I purchased my first Panasonic trimmer about 15 years ago. It was solid and did a great job.When it was time to buy another there was no question that I was buying another Panasonic. My mistake! didn't last 6months.
4,Good but not as good as my old one.,"So far this Braun Multiquick does the job. But it is not as well made as my original that was 12-14 years old. The steel blade and other parts do not fit as securely on the base as the older machine. They wobble on the stem when inserted. I guess that just the way things are made today...not as precisely as in the past. But it does seem to work. I haven't tried the many attachments and am looking forward to doing so.Delivery was prompt, etc., so no complaint there."
4,I like it,"It has good design, My Friend show me this product, he hs it for many years and was satisfied too. I will try it later."
3,Disappointment,"After reading all these wonderfull reviews I ordered the Combimax.I love to cook and I was really excited when it arrived.But... (maybe it is my bad luck!) I was kinda dissapointed.I really like the design and versatility, but my machine- especially whenI shredded on speeds higher than 4 showed unaccaptable vibration.It even moved on my granite countertop and I was forced to hold it with one hand.It is possible that it is ""one copy"" defect, but it obviously is unbalanced well enough.So, after having nice ""waiting"" time I decided to return it back to Amazon.I feel my review is like a drop of s-t into barrel with cristall water, butI do not see it any different from what I described above."
4,"So far, so good","I haven't used thisBraun Multiquick 3 K650 Kitchen Machine 600 Wattmuch yet, but it seems to work well. I had, but never used, a food processor before so I can't compare it against other models or brands.It's nice that everything is dishwasher-safe.I do have some quibbles:There is no storage of any kind for the blades. Most of them are small enough to keep in the bowl, but the chopper blade (arguably the most dangerous) and mixing/kneading blade don't. Fortunately, the chopper comes with a safety guard.It comes with a nice assortment of blades, and a juicer, but for some reason you have to buy the coarse slicing insertBraun CombiMax Food Processor Coarse Slicing Insert 7000-490separately.The ""french fry system""Braun CombiMax Food Processor French Fry System 3200-634is also separate, but I wasn't interested in that.I would recommend this unit to anyone who is cooking for a small- to medium-size group. I was able to puree nine baking potatoes in one go, but just barely."
5,So quiet,"I'm really impressed,plenty of power. My old kitchenaid food processer was so loud I needed ear protection,with thin plastic that broke the locking tabs off the first time I used it. I was begining to think that there was no such thing as a good one.This processer is so great, I'll look at other Braun products before other brands in the future."
5,Based on limited use,"I love this food processor. Granted, I have only used it a few times, but--I made baking powder biscuits, it worked a treat; made cole slaw and mashed bananas that were ripe, but pretty firm. Quiet and powerful. Really glad I bought it. I do think, though, that I paid enough for it all slicing blades should have been included."
1,junk,This is cheaply made and the knob came off. I've been happy with other Braun products in the past but this is flimsy. Keep looking.
3,Just used it twice,"I purchased this item in Jan and just used it twice, both times for chopping vegetables(cauliflower and onions). It did a fantastic job chopping them and was very easy to use and clean up, but after a couple of days I saw that the stainless steel blade had rust marks on it.I had washed the blade and air dried it, did not put it in the dishwasher. I cannot believe that the steel had rusts after the first 2 days of using it. I'm hoping I can get a replacement from Amazon or Braun for the blade since it is within the 30 day window but I'm shocked that this happened. Anybody else had this issue? Also, the box and the machine both say Braun Multiquik K 650 and not Combimax. I called Duddy to confirm and they said they are both the same machine and it is marketed by different names in different parts. It looks just like the Combimax machine pictures."
4,Powerful and great so far!,"We've had this only for a few weeks but it's worked as expected for a food processor. I haven't tried the dough mixer or the egg beater yet, but I am sure they're great. It has a 30 variable speed. I was a bit disappointed with the citrus attachment because the ridges on it are too small and it doesn't get much juice out."
1,The most horribly manufactured CD ever!,"I first heard a version of this song on MTV's AMP and loved it. I was thrilled to discover it was available to buy, and the tracks by themselves are fabulous techno dance music, but MY GOD the sound quality on the CD is horrendous! They are needlessly made to sound tinny and statac-y, like you were hearing then coming from an overly amplified stereo inside a rusty used car that was falling apart. Or, perhaps, sounding like your downstairs neighbor had his stereo cranked but had the treble turned to 11 and you were hearing it through the heating ducts. Who ever is responsible for ruining this great music should be made to spend eternity tied to a chair in Hells disco with Western Auto hearing aids in both ears. I don't mean the sound quality is merely bad, it is virtually unlistenable and I am bitterly disappointed. I wasted my money, don't waste yours."
1,"Dont buy, bad mastering!","This CD is out of print and should stay that way, because OH MAN THE SOUND IS TERRIBLE! It sounds all thin and ""flangy""! Buy the 10th anniversary Vinyl release of House of God or download the many remixes on whatever P2P file sharing program you prefer, cause this SUCKS!"
3,Overpriced and food burns easily,"JetBoil stoves are designed to boil water fast and they do that extremely well, but they are not designed to cook or simmer food so do that poorly. This pan is light, well-designed and fits the stove perfectly, but does not justify the high price. Very difficult to clean, too. Same functionality available in non-brand products at half the cost."
3,"Useful and fast, though could be better","I got this dictionary because I couldnt get a decent one on internet. It is a useful system, the dictionary will recognize if the word typed in is in English or Spanish or both, and will let you decide which function (noun, adjective, article, etc) you want translated. Its fast and helpful. What I found dissapointing is that from 10 words I look up, 1 does not appear. And also, that many entries in Spanish use mexican as main dialect for expressions rather than using a combination of Latin American and also Spanish varieties."
2,Great Frother - espresso consistently inconsistent,"The frother is great! Easy to use etc. The espresso temperature is 140 degrees F when measuring the stream of coffee coming from the machine after the machine has warmed up for 6 minutes. At that LOW temperature you can't extract the flavors and aroma required for a great cup of espresso. Other reviews stating it can take 5 minutes to brew a cup of espresso are accurate. This occurs when the grind is too fine. I've had this machine for over a year and it is NOT recommended. I use it mainly for the frother and make the espresso in another machine. To add insult to injury, the chrome like decal on the machine has an air bubble under it so it looks cheap. I thought it was chrome undil the decal started to get this bubble. Previously I had a Gaggia which is superior in every manner, and cheaper also. The only reason I rated it 2 stars is because of the frother."
1,finicky machine has a real design problem,"I bought the Capresso 114 last December (the difference being, the model 112 has chrome trim and a very questionable milk reservoir). This machine is unbelievably finicky; you must use an extremely coarse grind (according to the manual), and almost zero tamping pressure (again, according to the manual), otherwise you get unbelievably slow coffee flow (several minutes for a shot of espresso). Even when you get everything according to instructions (which includes, according to Capresso tech support, disassembling the machine every few days), it takes at least 5 minutes to pour a shot of espresso, which comes out weak, bitter, and with no crema. After two months of discussing this with Capresso tech support and getting nowhere, I returned the machine to Amazon. After that I bought a Krups XP 4000 -- bliss! The machine makes great espresso in about 25 seconds, even with a fine grind and firm tamp."
3,"OK - - Just OK , not great","I purchased this accessory for my recently acquired Motorola V551 phones (wife and I have the same model phone) We had only used Nokia phones and original accessories in the past, but since I could not find a similar Motorola product (other than one costing $40), I took a chance on this desktop charger. It charges in the same amount of time as the standard charger that came with the phone, i.e. 3 to 4 hours with a run down battery. However, the LED's on the device are useless. They say that the battery was charged in 20 minutes, and the instructions say you should believe them vs the indicator on your phone. It would be impossible to charge a completely drained battery in 20 minutes, so my advice would be to believe what your phone is telling you and leave it in the charger until the phone tells you the charging is complete. However, with that said, it is an inexpensive desktop charger that does seem to work OK, and can also charge an extra battery at the same time."
4,A Great Alternative Charger,This charger is indeed better than the factory plug-in charger. I only gave it 4 stars because it is still touchy if the phone is not placed in correct.
4,So far it is working fine.,"I have two Motorola phones and so far both of these phones are charging up fine with this desktop charger. I have not tried charging an individual battery yet. I have also changed the default charge time on my phone to eight hours. I don't know if this makes any difference. Per other reviews, I don't pay any attention to the LCD charging display on the desktop unit."
2,Unimpressive finish.,"For $94 you would have thought that this product was finished properly - no. The pull line for detach has four balls on it, however was not knotted. The balls slide off. Easily fixed with a knot, but what sort of product quality is this?The product looks otherwise solid, however I might jump overboard to test it first - just to make sure that the other components were tied together.Not impressed."
4,Animated Classic indeed!,"I've watched Bugville many times and enjoyed it every time.(I enjoyed the three bonus Fleischer cartoons that are included on this DVD as well, and felt they definitely gave an extra bang for my buck.)The new cover brings vibrant new life to this classic animated film.If you like classic animation, I highly recommend Bugville!"
1,"Okay film, but TERRIBLE presentation.","The film itself is an okay animated film, especially an improvement over Gulliver's Travels, but the presentation of this version is just plain AWFUL. The opening has this stupid fake aged title slapped on it, and the picture quality is full of sickening digital compression--you know it's bad when i can literally see the PIXELS without even fullscreening it on my computer's DVD player!If you want to see this film the way it was meant to be seen, import the Studio Ghibli release of the film, which gave the film a FANTASTIC restoration job--much better than this atrocious release."
1,An extremely poor attempt to mimic the Disney animated features.,"""Bugville"" is an extremely poor attempt to mimic the Disney animated features. The animation is not visually interesting, the story is thin and dull, the music is extraordinarily bland, and the DVD transfer is scratchy. This movie is nothing like Dave and Max Fleischer's Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons of the 1930's, or their Superman cartoons of the 1940's. The movie has none of the creative visual gags or humor of the Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons, nor does it have the stylish animation or exciting action of the Superman cartoons. The movie also lacks the beauty and storytelling of the Disney animated features. The DVD transfer is not too bad most of the time, but the film and the sound are scratchy at times, and the animation looks a little fuzzy."
2,Too pixelated,This appears to be some sort of pirate/pubic domain copy. They had to hide the original title for some reason and image quality is very poor.
4,A Classic!,"I've watched Bugville many times and enjoyed it every time.(I enjoyed the three bonus Fleischer cartoons that are included on this DVD as well, and felt they definitely gave an extra bang for my buck.)The new cover brings vibrant new life to this classic animated film.If you like classic animation, I highly recommend Bugville!"
2,Only for die-hard fans.,"Marilyn Monroe is great, but the rest of this movie is pretty much unwatchable. Skip it and watch ""Some Like it Hot"" again instead."
2,MM can do no wrong/SLO can and does,"Elegantly filmed, exquisitely designed and costumed, and Marilyn is full of life -- one can't take ones eyes off of her -- but Sir Lawrence Olivier missed the emotional, romantic core of the story of socio-eco-conflicted starstruck almost-lovers. Maybe both acting and directing were too much for him on film rather than on stage. Or maybe Miss Monroe, the consummate movie actress, was too instinctive and spontaneous for his formal, studied, exercise in self control. Ironically this was the conflict between the two main characters in the story, but on screen it only comes off as a confusion of acting styles as if they were in two different movies entirely, sinking the whole mess of a project once you begin to wonder just what does that showgirl see in this self absorbed mannequin after all?"
2,Get it for Monroe,"This is a very mediocre movie. If it did not have the divine Marilyn and sir Olivier in it, if others had played their parts, nobody today would remember this flick. As it is, Olivier does well playing an ultra stuffed-shirt aristocrat, as there is nothing more to the character than that. The only real virtue of the movie is Marilyn, who in this movie, even more so than many of her others, is . . . how should I put this . . . Totally HOT."
4,How Hollywood helps wins wars.,"Marilyn Monroe's hidden intelligence and skill decloaks fairly early on in the film viz. the scene after she realizes that she has been invited to a ""tete a tete"" dinner instead of a larger affair.There are some ominous hints at how important Laurence Olivier's character is viz. he likes Kaiser Wilhelm and he instructs his staff to contact the Japanese Emperor.The film is set in 1911.If Marilyn Monroe didn't have that iconic figure, she would still be funny and fun to watch and this movie shows that. She would have been great in modern films too.She even has a Sookie Stackhouse scene where she waxes about how if anyone would know how to romance a girl, it would be a Hungarian Prince that cuts to a shot of Olivier's VERY unseductive demeanor!"
4,The prince and the showgirl,very entertaining movie with Marilyn Monroe and Lawrence Olivier at their best. It is so funny.
4,The Prince & the Showgirl,"When I saw this movie on DVD I added it to my Wish List immediately. Then I saw the Deluxe Series. I scrolled down to read the reviews, and was confused by one reviewers statement that the film was in Widescreen. According to IMDB the original negative is 35mm, 1:37. ????"
2,"not wide screen , not aspect ratio of= 1.85","if only this was in widescreen then it would be 5 out of 5 but its 2 out of 5 because of that , i hope we can get it in the future in widescreen, it even said at the back of the box that it was in aspect ratio 1:85 (wide screen) too bad, but the rest of this is nice , thanks ."
4,Very Entertaining,A delightful movie with great performances by both Monroe and Olivier. Funny love story.
3,MARILYN IS BEAUTIFUL!!!,"This isn't the best of her movies, but Marilyn is great to look at and she is very talented in this love story. Olivier, who i love, is also very good in this slow moving romance. worth a look just to watch marilyn's beauty..."
4,"""What's not to like""","I thought ""The Prince & The Show Girl,"" (DVD) was about as good as it gets with MM. A fun tale of opposites attracting. Monroe in one of her finer films."
1,The Prince and the Showgirl DVD,"I plan on returning this DVD. Each time I try and load the movie, I get ""wrong region"". I have tried to load on another DVD player and get the same result."
2,Dreadful,"Marilyn Monroe stars as Elsie, a London chorus girl who catches the eye of a visiting Prince (Laurence Olivier). He's in town to attend King George's coronation along with his teenage son, the King of Carpathia, with whom he is at odds, politically. Elsie comes to share a midnight supper with the Prince and ends up resolving all the problems between father and son, thus insuring world peace.Yes, the movie really is that dumb. And annoying. I didn't care about any of the characters and, in fact, found the leads quite unlikable. Elsie is the stereotypical dumb blonde who is (of course) the smartest one in the story. Her giggly, breathy bimbo act gets very old fast. Olivier's Prince is a pompous, lascivious bully who hates his own and the son is unpleasant, as well. I couldn't root for any of them and thought the plot was predictable, corny, and most of all, tedious."
3,"Engaging story, Great performance by Marilyn","Marilyn breathes amazing life into what would otherwise be a lackluster movie.This is perhaps Laurence Olivier's worst performance ever, but it still doesn't stop it from being a very watchable movie. A good companion book to read, called ""The Prince, The Showgirl, and Me"" gives some insight into the reasons for this.Olivier apparently couldnt stand working with Monroe, and this spilled into his movie role. Worth watching, especially for Marilyn fans"
4,"Not bad, Miss Monroe!","When i first saw this movie, i had no idea who Laurence Olivier was. Boy, was i missing out. This isn't his best work(not by a long shot) but it is very entertaining, and Marilyn is suprisingly good. I give it 4 stars because the ending was bad."
3,"Enjoyable, albeit Odd.","I got two opinions before I watched this. ""It's good,"" and ""It is horrible, awful,couldn't finish it"". Well then, with some trepidation I sat and watched this. Monroe does do a good job, she is gorgeous in it, albeit in almost the same white dress the whole time. And Olivier's outbursts of rage are fantastic. They do seem to not really connect, and it was very hard at times to understand several of the characters. It is a very slow movie in many ways, it would have been alot better if it had a faster pace, it would have suited the sort of craziness of the plot a lot better. ( And I really could have done with the lengthy coronation scene)The ending wasn't really what I would have liked it to be. But I liked seeing her being witty, and beleiving that she was. Overall I liked it, the music was good, as were the costumes and the acting. Not the best movie in the world, but not the worst by any means."
3,"""The Prince And The Showgirl""","I think that this the best Marilyn Monroe film that she made in England.(She only made one film in England.). The only quibble I have is with Warner Bros. Video for still not yet releasing this, on DVD, in its Letterboxed format. This is still the (original) ""pan-and-scan"" version."
2,Not in Widescreen,"It's hidden and at the very end of the product description, so maybe you'll miss it like I did. The DVD is in the old ""standard"" 1:33 format, meaning they chopped off the sides to fit the older, smaller box TV format. This was filmed in 1957, so I believe it was filmed in widescreen, wasn't it? I give the movie five stars; it's one of MM's best. Just rating the DVD release two stars for this reason. I want to see the movie like it was shown in the theaters, so I will return my copy to Amazon, and wait for a decent release of this classic movie."
5,The Mystery of the Stolen Boxcar,"With the Founder's Day celebrations quickly approaching, the Aldens begin plans to redecorate their boxcar as a float for the parade, until their boxcar suddenly and mysteriously vanishes. The dog has been stolen with it. Can they solve their most important mystery yet?"
1,The real review...what you need to know,"Here is the real review. The one I got did NOT have this button problem I have been reading about. That tells me that all of you who had to hold the button down had defective buttons. The main thing, it takes way too much ice cream to make way too few cones. The chute does not hold enough ice cream before needing more packed in. I packed the chute full, and got one cone out. I packed it again and got two cones. The blade stores about a cones worth on it, so when you are done, put it in the freezer for next time.I returned it. I would rather use all that great ice cream packed hard on a cone. It takes alot longer to eat a hard ice cream cone that a soft one, that's for sure. Stick to the hard stuff."
1,Big waste of money,I picked this up thinking it was a ice cream maker until when I got it home I saw what it really was but I said whatever I'll keep it and give it a try. BIG MISTAKE! This thing barely stirs the ice cream and it take almost half a carton to make one big cone. This is a poor investment dont not buy!!!!
2,Too Bad ...,"It's too bad ... I really wanted this to work, since I love soft serve. But after using it twice I donated to Goodwill.It would be great if somebody brought out a home version of the ""drill"" thing they use in some frozen yogurt places. Until then the best bet is to let the ice cream or frozen yogurt thaw in the fridge for a few hours, then stir it up with a spoon until it's the preferred level of softness."
1,Not worth the trouble,"It takes a lot of ice cream just to ""prime"" this thing and in the end you end up with a big mess and not much else. I wouldn't recommend it and certainly wouldn't buy another."
3,Too much work and better in theory than practice,"The idea of soft serve cones spurred me to buy this item, but it turned out to be a lengthy, time-consuming process to get it to work. Now, whenever I want a soft-serve cone, I look at this machine sitting in the corner and contemplate if it's worth it. It's not. My husband, kids, and I usually decide that the hassle of driving to Dairy Queen 20 minutes away is less hassle than dealing with this machine. However, if you have time on your hands, like fooling with gadgets and messy, melting ice-cream (you have to serve it immediately; can't wait for everyone to eat theirs at once, and don't mind the headache of constantly filling this machine, then maybe you'll like it. It's too much headache for our family, although in theory it seemed fun."
4,Arctic Twist Ice Cream Maker,"This is great! It was a gift to my 12-year old daughter. She can use it and clean it with minimal help. It is so simple to use - just fill it with regular ice cream and the toppings you want, and out comes delicious soft ice cream. Beats running to Dairy Queen for a Blizzard all the time! The only negative thing is that not all of the ice cream comes out; however, we just eat that with a spoon after we take it apart."
2,BAD PRODUCT!,The Ice cream melts in the machine and all you get is goo! I am sure ther is a way to prevent it though.
1,Wastes Ice Cream,"My Fiancee and I received this as a bridal shower gift and were very excited to try it out, we both love soft serve ice cream but we were disapointed by it. Its a good concept however, it is a little difficult to opperate and wastes a lot of Ice Cream. We returned the product and did not purchase another ice cream maker. For the price of it and the price of ice cream these days I'd rather go out and get a soft serve cone once in a while!"
4,Good if you don't use it everyday,"I got this because I thought that it would be a fun item to have around. It is, but it does have it's faults.It is really hard for one person to work this machine. There has to be at least two. The ice cream melts a lot before you even get it through the machine (another reviewer mentioned putting parts in the freezer before you use the machine).The prep time to use this machine is a pain. You either have to use a melon baller or another small scooper or cut the ice cream into cubes before you put them in the machine. Using a normal ice cream scooper will be too big. If the ice cream is frozen solid, cut it into cubes and put it in the freezer so it can soften a bit, the machine will work much better.Clean up isn't so bad. Have a sink of warm, soapy water ready. The sooner you get the machine in there, the easier it is to clean. If you can't clean the machine right away, let it soak for a bit."
1,What a piece of !@?@ ?,No stars for this! The only way this product would get a star from me would be a big punch in the eye to the people at Black and Decker. I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for the family. Today is the first try for nice smooth ice cream and the machine broke before the first chocolate chip hit the ice cream. Today is Dec. the 26th. So now I have to go to the trouble of sending it back. What a piece of junk. Hope you all have better luck with it than I.
1,Disappointing and very noisy,This noisy machine was extemely disappointing for my daughter's 15th birthday. You have to put in a lot of ice cream in the machine to achieve a single serving because a large portion of the ice cream remained in the twisting portion of the unit. Certainly not worth the rather high price.
1,Don't waste your money on this.,I bought this and found like the others before me the button is awful to press. It needs two persons and the majority of the icecream stays in the machine. Good idea but bad make.
2,no good for just 1 person,"I got this as a gift, and while it looked really cool, you have to put a ton of ice cream in to yield just one cone, since most of the ice cream ends up getting stuck on the spindle. Also the unit is poorly designed because you need at least 2 people to operate cause you have to hold down the ""on"" button, all while pushing down the plunger and turning the cone. The only thing this is good for is maybe a children's birthday party"
1,It stinks!,This thing is a total waste of time and money and i wouldnt suggest anyone waste their hard earned money on it.
1,JUNK,"I recieved this as a gift.I tried it out several times.The consistency is nothing like soft ice cream,more like hard ice cream that has been sitting out.Wastes most of your ice cream anyway.Total junk.Also black and decker has not been a pleasent company to work with.After much insistence they are going to investigate the situation and consider some form of a refund."
1,A summer disappointment,"My husband loves ice cream. He loves ice cream with a lot of chunks and chocolate and yummy goodness. I got all stocked up. A 10 gallon econo pak of ice cream, and about 10 packs of candies.What a waste! I followed all the directions, including freexing the parts. It was a mess. The ice cream wouldn't come off the twister, into the bowl. Everytime I had to dismantle the machine and use a spoon to get the mushy mess off. You can't even lick it because the edges are sharp! Don't buy this, just go buy the pricy ice cream and save a real ice cream headache!!"
4,A bag... not a game,The bag works great for the 360 and its cords but the lack of extra space for a couple games ruins the whole less luggage idea.
4,decent but needs work,"No place to put games, I am able to fit two in with the console. Fiber on back side of bag easily begins to look freyed."
4,The Blue Angel Still Holds Up Today,"Amazingly, this seventy-plus-year-old movie classic is as fresh and entertaining as any film currently released. This DVD presents the best quality of The Blue Angel I have ever seen, in two completely restored versions (English & German) plus wonderful photos and commentary. You may be uneager to buy this DVD set due to the fact that a lot of video tape versions are under ($), but let me tell you, this is worth every penny. Includes as bonuses: a great 1929 Dietrich screen test, a brief interview, and Dietrich performing songs from the movie in the 1960's/1970's. A film-buff treat!"
5,This film is a work of art.,"Memorable acting, haunting story, beautiful Marlene. This is certainly one of my favorite films of all time. The Kino version is the best version available to purchase, please make a note of that."
3,Beware! No German Blue Angel,"This set only contains the English version of the film. You still need to shell out $31.00 for the earlier KINO release of the film that has both the German and English versions. If the superior German version had been included, this set would have received a 5 star rating."
2,NOT THE BARGAIN IT SEEMS,"I bought this set because I thought I would be getting PANDORA AND THE DUTCHMAN at a bargain price. Not so. This set does not contained the ""RESTORED"" PANDORA, but a ridiculously dark print with far too many jump cuts with lost dialogue. I should have opted for the Restored version. And THE BLUE ANGEL is the English version only. In other words, this set is not a ""bargain"" for serious collectors. On the other hand - if you're not picky and only want to see these two films for their storylines, this set may be all you need."
1,"If you're looking for Rita Hayworth, look elsewhere","Not only are these movies EXTREMELY bad transfers (you can actually see the wall they're taping from), but I double-dog-dare-you to find Rita Hayworth in ""Dancing Pirate"". I guarantee you won't. I returned my copy."
1,crazy-lazy english translation,"the film, of course, is wonderful. i chose this one because it said Enhanced but i found it at times incoherent. what they chose to do is i think the worst of both worlds -- traditionally (i'm over sixty) purists watched the original language film with subtitles, and the less pure, i suppose, got a complete set of english voices. what this edition does, strangely, to my mind, is leave the minor audio track in german, and only splice in those parts on full-face, so in a multi-voiced scene in the theatre say there is this unnerving german background and i just found it really incoherent and spoiling the emotional impact of the film. the film itself is a gem -- i would just not recommend this version. i am not familiar with the others. i choose carefully i thought but not well. so i just wanted to offer a head's up."
5,The Blue Angel,"The most devastating bit of popular entertainment ever made. The film is constructed around the hum-drum life of schoolteacher, Emil Jannings; thus throwing a heavy spotlight on Marlene Dietrich, but all to what avail? As empty and soulless as the empty bottles and stuffed ashtrays at the end of the night in the Weimar beer halls it depicts. One can feel Von Sternberg holding back on his usual visual flair to give credence to the story itself. Can one imagine a modern day actress like Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock as Lola Lola? Dietrich is absolutely stunning and a marvel to behold in this film."
4,Stay with your own kind,The professor should have stayed in his own world of the intellect. All the knowledge he picked up from his university studies and his books could not prepare him for the world of burlesque.Marlene's rendition of the signature song is an outstanding message for all time. It is haunting!
5,THE BLUE ANGEL,"Wow, at last a great copy of this wonderful film. If you like Dietrich as I do you will enjoy this film. A must have in one's collection of Films on Blu-ray."
2,Kino's Blu-ray Release Contains Only The German Version,"Kino is releasing the blu-ray edition of this landmark film including only the German version on the disk. Notice that the upcoming British and German blu-ray releases do bring the two versions of the film, German and English. Shame on Kino!"
5,Honk!,Honk! is a great show all ages. I am currently cast in the musical as Ida the mother of Ugly (the ugly duckling). The musical is made for people of all ages. I've found that teenagers and adults can have as much fun with this show as kids if not more so. The show contains many great one liners that can be really funny...if u get them. The music is great and the characters are really fun. I'm sure that if you listened to the music and/or saw the show you would have just as much fun as I have been having.
4,Delightful and Amusing Soundtrack!,"This hillarious soundtrack is a modern adaptation of the Ugly Duckling. Geared for kids, but still enjoyable for adults, I'd recommend this soundtrack and play to anyone who likes to laugh."
5,The one to Get,"This is the best recording of Honk, although I wish North Shore Music Theater's first in the US production (staring a fresh out of college Gavin Creel) which was even stronger musically than this recording. This one is heads and shoulders better than Witchita Music Theater's so so cast. Unfortunately its not all that available in the US, so if necessary go to Amazon UK and scoop it up."
3,"Great book, disappointing format","This is a beautiful book - lovely recipes, great photography, useful information for a food lover's trip to Provence, BUT - it's too big and bulky to bring along on your trip. (I had hoped for a book similar to Carla Capalbo's ""The Food Lover's Companion to Tuscany."") It's a great book, but I won't be bringing it to Provence next month."
2,To quote the Sex Pistols - 'Pretty Vacant',"A very pretty coffee table book with very little substance, kind of like a dumb supermodel."
2,... if you have no clue..,The book is filled with many common ideas you are probably aware of - for example the mileage on your Credit Card purchases. Also there is considerable content devoted to contests the author lucked in to. If you are a rube when it comes to seeking out travel deals then this book is for you.
2,middle of the road,"middle of the road, and nothing really new. i had written a long review about this, but amazon removed it after i posted that i would give away my copy of this dvd for free. it's all open forums, until someone questions capitalism. imagine that, a free exchange of goods."
1,Piece of yank,Panasonic is a great brand. When I purchased the nose hair groomer I was a 100% sure this was my best option based on my experience with panasonic products. However it was not. The groomer yanks the nose hair and the pain is terrible I even cried wow.
3,"Works okay, does the job but is uncomfortable","I bought this for my husband originally. He complained that it was uncomfortable to use, It works fine for me...a bit discomfort, but not too bad....ah the price of beauty!"
4,Worked Good. Lasted Two Years,My ER411 just died. It lasted about 2 years. Not bad I suppose as it doesn't cost much. It remained sharp and worked pretty good until the end when it just wouldn't start anymore. I'm going to try the ER421 now as that seems to be a newer model and it has a light on it.
4,Easy to use and clean,This product is easy to use and clean. It removes unsightly nose hairs without pulling. Works well for the price paid.
2,Bloody Nose Machine,"I've had this item for quite some time and keep giving it shot after shot after shot. This does a good job of cleaning out nose hairs, however it cuts the inside of my nose at the same time, leaving me with a blood crusted inside which takes weeks to heal! It also gets really hot when in use, which makes it even less comfortable!"
3,"Good cut, but painful!","The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer does a great job at cutting close -- but it feels like it's pulling the hair as much as it's cutting! By the time I am finished, my eyes are truly teared up. I had another trimmer that just got old. It didn't cut quite as close, but there was no pulling sensation at all. I will be trying another brand, as the discomfort level just isn't worth it."
3,"Worked Great, Until it Broke","I was totally satasfied with this item. Simple, straight forward and easy to use. I didnt have any of the ""pulling"" problems other reviewers had either. Just a bit of a tickle while it was trimming.I used this about once a week, just to keep everyting under control, for about 4-5 weeks. Then it just stopped working, wont work no matter what I do. And yes, I did try new battereies.For the price this is a great item, if it would have lasted more than 4-5 uses. I think I will buy a nicer one next time and hope it lasts a little longer."
1,Do NOT Purchase This Item!,"I have purchased 3 of these, (1) a couple of years ago, (2) and (3) this last August, 2006.The last two were purchased because of the performance of (1). As of now, all 3 have failed because of a poor switch, which chooses to fail in the OFF position. This is all after testing with new batteries. The battery connection seems secure. All else works well when it works. The switches are the Achilles heel. $45.00 is enough of a test. I am going to try something else."
3,It works...but not as long as it should,"This is actually the 2nd one I've bought. It works as advertised but just doesn't seem to last long. The 1st lasted about 1 year but when you condier it's probably only used a minute or so once or twice a week that's really not a lot of actual use before it just quits. It did the job fine and when you get down to it I suppose it's pretty much a disposable item since the price isn't much. I just expect it to last longer.Will it do the job, yes. Will you have to replace it, yes."
2,Ouchy!,"Of the 3 nose hair trimmers, 'personal grooming devices', I've used this one caused the most pain. It has the tendency to grab the hairs as the blades spin, pulling them painfully.Be cautious with this device, I suggest one withOUT spinning blades and with reciprocating ones instead."
1,Electric nose-hair PULLER!!,"I've had a nose-hair groomer (Wahl) that actually cuts nose hairs - dropped it to a bad landing one day, and had to replace it. This Panasonic got such great reviews, how could I go wrong? It's ""chosen"" by Hammacher-Schlemmer -- must be the world's best, right???The one I ordered did cut the nose hairs, but first gave them a good hard tug! OWEEE!! Well, this can't be right, I said, so I exchanged my first torture device, and the replacement does exactly the same thing!!! Since it's now the only one I have, I reluctantly go through this torture, with watering eyes and clenching teeth, every other month or so.OK, the results are clean-looking, but I really don't think it's worth the pain. CanNOT recommend it!!"
2,Broke After 1 Year,"This gadget never had much power, pulled at my admittedly jungle-like nose hairs painfully, and quit for good after a year. Next!"
1,Completely stopped working after only four months,"Worked great until one day when it wouldn't turn on. Changed the battery, cleaned the contacts, disassembled and reassembled the head/blade section, and nothing. The thing just up and died on me. For fifteen bucks it's not worth pursuing a repair or a warranty but I just want to warn prospective buyers that this is a distinct possibility. Still, it worked fine until this happened."
3,"Works well, but OWWW!","This little devil really does work well.Batteries last a long time, trims hair well, but ...... it really hurts.Anyone know of less painful product??"
5,"Wow, what a great buy!","While my age shall remain unknown to you, I have looked for a long time for a comfortable way to trim those pesky nose hairs. I can't believe such a great product is being sold for such a low price. This should be in every medicine cabinet in America! It does an excellent job, with minimal discomfort and no pain. Highly recommended."
1,Worst ever! A gift ended in the trash can,It pulls hairs badly! My husband tried three times and it does so EVERY time. He will never never use it again!
1,Poor Performance,Disappointed with this item. I have been using Panasonic ER411 for the last 2-3 years and it was a very good product. That's why i bought this ER411NC. But ER411NC is not up to its expectations.
1,It hurts..,I never thought Panasonic will make a product which will hurt so badly. The one I got is really useless because it plugs the hair often.
2,Not that great to me.,"Looks like the one I have and am looking for another one even though mine still ""works"". Very disappointed. I was going to Sharper Image until saw the 1 review."
3,It works but breaks pretty easy,It works well but as soon as you take it apart to clean it is nearly impossable to get it back together and working as well as it was out of the box.
4,"Nice job, but tickles a bit.","I'm unfortunately getting to the stage where hair starts growing in more and more places that I don't want it to. So I needed a trimmer, and one that could handle the ears and nose. This little guy works great. I doesn't pull and gets in pretty close. My only complaint is that the vibrations from the head tickle the heck out of my nose. But all in all, a good choice."
1,This thing is a piece of junk,Cheaply built & the blade speed rapidly declines upon each use despite cleaning & fresh batteries. I've gone through two of these things in the past few months & ultimately gave up on them as they wound-up painfully ripping hairs out.Look elsewhere for a quality product.
1,GARBAGE,"THIS TYPE OF NOSE TRIMMER IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. PANASONIC USE TO MAKE ONE FOR BROOKSTONE AND IT CUT MUCH CLOSER . BUT NOW BROOKSTONE IS HAVING ONE MADE FOR THEM JUST LIKE THIS PIECE OF JUNK. OPEN IT UP AND IF THE CUTTING BLADES ARE STRAIGHT UP, IT'S NO GOOD. LOOK FOR THE ONE THAT HAS BLADES AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE AND YOU HAVE THE GOOD ONE."
1,Breaks all the time,"First one broke in less than a year. Same for the second and third. I give up. Don't buy.Edit: Tried the Wahl wet/dry. I sucked arse in a big way. Didn't trim close at all. Completely useless. I'm going to buy this one again, because it does work well. It's noisy, and will break within 6 months, but it does the job. Actually, I'll buy two. I hate it, but I can't try all of them."
2,YMMV,"I read the reviews before buying one of these to replace an older Panasonic model that I liked. Quite a few reviewers reported this model pulls on the hair. I didn't know if they just had sensitive nostrils so I thought it worth a try. Well, I'm sorry I did as mine gives a very painful experience and I'm not an experienced hair trimmer user. And other models don't have any better reviews, including the one that worked well for me before it died.I think the reason for the mixed reviews is a good number of these units come right from the factory with poor cutting blades, hence some love it and some winch over it. In hind sight I should have returned it but at the time it didn't occur to me this type of health and beauty items could be returned. The unit is reasonable well-made so I give it two stars, for performance alone I would it it none as I haven't found any use for it. If I had the box it came in I'd wrap it up and give it to my worse enemy LOL."
1,"Flimsy, doesn't work too well","This fell on the floor as I was taking it out of the box, fell totally apart, and despite all sorts of effort on my part to put it back together, it doesn't work very well. Maybe it is my fault and I am butterfingers, but something should not break that easily, especially if it is something that is made to be used around hard floors, i.e. the bathroom."
2,"Works fine, breaks easily.","Functions well overall, although a few painful nicks led me to be careful about not getting it too close to the skin inside the nostrils. Breaks very easily. Drop it 2-3 feet on a hard surface and it may no longer function - this has happened to me twice."
2,Ouch,"That's right, ouch. I'm surprised other reviews haven't said this thing friggin hurts to use. A few point to keep in mind; I have used a nose trimmer before w/ no problems (chrome Remington model). By ""hurt"" I mean it doesn't feel good, not ""I'm a puss"". Lastly, I have nose whiskers not just nose hair, this matters. Just like shaving your teenage peach fuzz was no hassle compared to knocking down the man beard. This trimmer pulled out some hair and kind of ground down the rest. I think it would do a better job cutting finer hair... not the 20 gage wire I'm growing. Overall this product gets the job done but I would not recommend it."
4,A quality product,"I just fired up my new trimmer today. It worked much better than either of the two other products that I have tried. The testing ground was nose and ears. My nostrils had so much hair in them that the hair ebbed and flowed with every breath like squid tentacles. But this trimmer handled the challenge well. The only reason I did not award 5 stars was because I felt like the hair was almost being pulled, so the trimming process made me a bit edgy.Please do not ask me to borrow nose hair trimmer. It is for my use only."
2,quit working after 3 months,"initially It was painfull to use. If you are not carefull, it will nick and pull hair. takes some time to get used to. It does a good job of cutting hair though.Also mine quit working after 3 months. I am a big fan of panasonic but not this product."
3,"Do you buy this Groomer, if you do not really need it!","I purchased this one, because I at first think it might help me to remove several of my long nose hair, which is unpleasant.But once I use it, i found problems emerging. Since it is disturbing the natural condition of our nose inside by cutting those long hair as well as Those Normal Hair, my nose feel so uncomfortable after the hair is cut. And you will fell itchy as the hair is growing.It even gives me hard breathing some time, which i have never experience before.On the other side, frankly speaking, this device works well, if you really need it and your long nose hair really annoys you.Therefore, if you are not really need it, pls do not buy it just because it is interesting."
1,Try again,Have you ever droped your razor in the sink while saving? Well thats what happened with this nose groomer the very first time I used it. The tip bent and is now unuseable. In my opinion it' not up to standards.Save your money don't buy it!
1,OUCH,I used this trimmer once and stuck it too far inside my nose. Extreme pain and blood pouring out. Had to call 911 and be rushed to the emergency room. It ripped the inside of my nose out. Wooooh!
3,Decent,"This product works--it removes the hair. But it also hurts! It can pinch a little bit when snipping the hairs, but I am told that almost all of them do that?"
5,A gift to myself,While shopping for a beard trimmer for my husband for Christmas I was offered a bundled deal with this little trimmer. Wish I had bought one years ago. It accomplishes the task safely and quickly and without the vibrations that a friend had reported made him sneeze when using similar device from a different manufacturer.
2,Good but breaks easily,"I keep buying this item over and over because it's cheap. However, it always breaks after a few months of use."
2,Works OK for a while,"I have bought two of these and both sufferred the same terminal problem after a few months useage. The blade seems to get stuck against the external metal housing at the tip. You can unscrew the tip and the blades rotate, but reattaching the tip stops the blade movement. I've taken both units apart and reassembled which sometime temporaily fixes the problem. No more for me... nostrils will just get hairier.."
1,Mine Stopped Working,"After a year of light use, mine kept spinning but stopped cutting. My e-mail query to Panasonic was never answered. Caveat Emptor: It works okay until it stops working. Expect to buy another before too long."
3,maybe worth 5 bucks,"this thing hurts!! nose hairs are yanked and that ain't a feelin good. then it goes thru batteries like sherman thru the south, eating them up...wish i had not bght, as ends up doubling price by battery cost so far."
2,Think well before buying,"I just got it 2 weeks ago and once I tried it, I was hurt. It is true that it is water rinsable, which is great, but it hurts when you use it, not all the time but it does when you least expect it."
1,I've tried two of these and they both were awful,"Within the first week the blade got weak and it would pull the hair before cutting it. OUCH! OUCH! OUCH! Then it would frequently stop spinning. This was very painful when a nose hair is caught in the trimmer and you have to pull it out. OUCH! OUCH! OUCH! Basically I read all the good reviews and thought maybe I just got a defective one, so I was dumb enough to get it again. Exact same experience. Either I have an abundance of thick nose hairs or this is a crappy product. It might very well be a combination of the two.Honestly, every Panasonic product I've owned has broken down on me before a resonable time. I opted to splurge and get a ""heavy duty"" nose hair trimmer from Sharper Image, and am quite pleased with it."
4,Good cut for the money,"Most men will reach the age when they look in the mirror one day and realize there is hair growing from their nose. When this day comes, it is important to remember that, like weed wackers, not all nose hair trimmers are created equal. Cheap cutters will pull the hair from the root. Yes, it leaves your nose smoother than babies' behind, but it's not pleasant. Trimmers that pull end up in the trash or yard sale right next to other creepy items. That having been said, these Panasonic trimmers leave a little bit of hair(maybe 1/8 of an inch) but at the same time, it doesn't usually pull. It's a worthy trade-off, and the cheapest trimmers I've found that don't yank the hairs from the root."
2,Bad quality.... it hurts a lot!!,"Well i bought this on december 2005, i used only 4 months, after that i dropped it and the blades went bad, not broken but they are not aligned anymore. I tried to fix it 3 times and i couldnt, but today i said that if i dont fix it i trash it, and finally i could fix it, its working again. But anyways, this grooming hurts a lot on the nose, and it eats a lot of batteries. I dont recomend it"
1,Terrible Reliability,The thing broke down in two weeks after about 5 uses.Panasonic refused to fix it.I'll stick with scissors from now on....cheaper and much more reliable.
1,Broke after 6 months,"After about 6 months of normal usage, it just stopped working. (While it did work it worked fine). I'd suggest trying something else."
1,Its a ripper not a cutter,"This little gem of a self torture device serves quite well in ripping out hairs by the root. The so called blades inside the head do not cut but instead the wind up your hairs and rip them out at the root. The amount of blood flow I experienced far out did any of my less than sober attempts using scissors. So if you enjoy that excruciating pain of shredding the inside of your nose, please buy this device."
2,disappointed & dissatisfied,I have had two ER411 Nose and Ear Hair Groomers before making this recent purchase. I thought those ER411 groomers were perfect. You could cut on the end as well as the side making them very effective. Panasonic has changed the inner blade design so that it cuts only on the side. The old design was referred to as a curved blade design. Panasonic packaging still refers to the ER411 having the curved blade. In phone calls to Panasonic I have been told that the new design is in effect now.
2,Use Caution,"I just got this model as an 'upgrade' for my tired old ER112, which has been my trusty companion for a few years now. One of the first things I noticed with the new ER411 was that I got an occasional sting from it. As a previous poster mentioned, it felt like a burn. The unit isn't getting hot, so it's certainly the result of an occasional sensitive hair being yanked.I slowly built up some trust until the unit managed to grab up some of my nose lining (yes, it hurt and bled a lot). From now on, the ER411 is for ears only. My old ER112 has never grabbed any skin and is the tool of choice for getting in the darker recesses of this bird's beak."
1,Not The Same Trimmer,"I have been happily using Panasonic's ER411 (not ER411NC) for the last few years. I use the trimmer daily due to a family curse (lol). The ER411 is the best trimmer I have ever used...and I tried them all. The ER411 trimmed hair very close to the skin. Well, I dropped my ER411 and the trimmer was dead. So, I purchased the ER411NC thinking the trimmers were the same. The trimmers are not the same.As other reviewers have stated, the ER411NC is a re-design of the ER411. The newer model does not work nearly as well as the older model. The newer model just ignores my annoying ear hair. Panasonic changed the blade design in the ER411NC. In an act of desperation, I replaced the cutting blades in my new ER411NC with the cutting blades from my dead ER411, now the trimmer works great. Great move Panasonic!If you need a trimmer that cuts hair close to the skin, the ER411NC is not a good choice."
4,"Would have gotten 5 stars, but...","this trimmer IS the best nose hair trimmer I have used by far. Be warned however- if you've never used a good one it will take getting used to. It is occasionally painful- not REALLY bad at all but you will notice it for sure if it grabs a hair the wrong way. I was very surprised to not see others talk about this in their reviews.Alas, mine was dropped on CARPET and died on me. Take VERY good care of it as it is obviously fragile and the length of life is questionable even if you do take care of it. I am purchasing another as it is so good, but Panny would do well to make it cut a little easier and absorb the inevitable drop."
1,Broken after 6 months,"I purchased this product this past June and it is broken already. The motor is failing badly. Changed batteries twice and it has a grinding noise coming from it that doesn't sound safe. I also believe it is rusting by being around our bathroom sink, and never in the water. I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Disappointed,"Soon after I purchased this product, the On/Off switch began to malfunction. It worked intermitently for awhile and then quick working altogether."
5,I should have bought this years ago,"I knew about these devices years ago but they sounded, well ... ouch! But I got one and it does not cut me up or anything, just some hair pulls that don't hurt much. I think I could have done better on some dates if I used this long ago! But don't tell my wife I said so! :)"
2,Disappointed and Returned Product,"Disappointed with this item. My husband has been using Panasonic ER411 for the last five years and it was a very good product. That's why I bought this ER411NC for him. But ER411NC is not up to its expectations. If you can find an ER411 anywhere, BUY IT! That's what I'm looking for - there should be some in a warehouse somewhere!"
2,"Maybe it's my bad luck, but...","altho my bro's same model works fine still, mine deteriorated and stopped working after about a year. I don't have that much hair and only use it for like half a minute a day, but it's stopped turning. It did work well while it lasted, but I'm hoping now the more expensive model will do the job a little longer."
5,Great gift for dad...,"Let's face it, when you get older, you get hairier. Are you sick of seeing dad with bushes growing out of his ears and nose? You bet you are. Sure, he will grimace when he opens it up, but he'll be on his way from crusty-gross nose to Queer-Eye Approved nasty-hair-free guy in seconds.It's quite easy to use, and it does its job. Feels a little bit weird the first few times, and remember you have to wipe down afterwards (otherwise little hair dust will be coming out all day!).Takes one AA battery, which lasts for a month or so or regular use, unless, of course, you grow hair at truly prodigious rates."
2,Fragile trimmer,Trimmer works well for the price.My big caution is that it is not very durable. My first fell off a shelf and the 4 foot drop killed it. I bought a second one and it fell 2 feet into a sink and stopped working as well.I'm gonna get another one and not keep it on those rickety shelves.
4,Good Value,"This product exceeded my expectations. The design and build quality both seem first rate. Battery life is good, and cleaning the trimmer head or replacing the battery are both a snap."
5,In one word - great!,"I bought this at an electronics store an year ago and can vouch for its usefulness. It would be sufficient to say that other companies are copying the design (store brands like Remington, etc) I used a have a combo total hair care from Remington and its trimmer would give me ""RED EARS"" and ""a sore inside the nose"" everytime I used it.Cleaning this unit is a breeze. I dismantled the head and there was nothing much that need to be cleaned. Just keeping it under running water everytime it is used.The AA baterry life is are not so bad either."
1,"VERY, VERY limited life","I have bought three of these -- I keep thinking I just got a dud. Apparently, they're all duds. They work okay (get the job done) when they work. But they only work a few months at most. The longest lasting one I've had lasted about 5 months. The one I just purchased stopped (just stopped) working in a matter of a few weeks. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Not durable,Mine conked out after only 6 months and maybe only 10 uses. The quality of the cutting blades was poor and resulted in some eye watering nose hair pulls.
2,Ouch!,"This device does an acceptable job of trimming nose and ear hairs, but at a price: it is downright painful! I can't tell if it's because its RPMs are too low, or if the blade is simply misaligned. But it pulls and snags like crazy. Not a lot of fun. Very surprising from Panasonic."
2,Hair erupts from my nose like lava from Mt Vesuvius...,"...and I have the pain threshold of the princess from the princess and the pea story, these devices should be designed with me in mind.When brand new this thing worked like gangbusters, however the razor sharp blades dulled quickly leaving me crying like a baby.Perhaps if the hair that sprouts from your nose is fine this tool will suffice, I'm still searching for the groomer that will be gentle to me yet viciously mow down stray hairs."
1,Don't waist your money.,When I first got the unit it worked fine. I noticed after the about three uses it's motor was slowing down. I replaced the battery but it did not help. I used it 8 times in a year and it's motor is all ready dead. I would not purchase another Panasonic unit being afraid it would all so die a quick death. Spend more money on a unit that will last longer.
4,does what it says,"It is a decent ear and nose trimmer. I would like to point out that it is plastic, not metal body. Also it would be nice if it could collect the cut hair so that a noseful of hair doesn't have to be rinsed out after cutting."
1,Lousy product!,"Like most things Panasonic, this thing broke down after about a year. Even when it worked, it was uncomfortable to use because even with fresh batteries it pulled hairs as much as cut them. It's cheaply made, and in spite of its premium price, it's a lousy product. Don't waste your money."
3,To Buy Or Not To Buy,The Nose and Ear Hair Groomer that I purchased has a tendency to occasionaly pull on a hair before it cuts it off. All other features are great.
3,"Always tickles, sometimes hurts",I bought this a couple months ago and have been using it regularly.When using this for my nose it always tickles and occasionally hurts. Before I bash it more let me say it works fast and gloriously for the ear. But the tickling/yanking when it comes to the nose makes it unpleasant and slow.Try this: Get a pair of those small grooming scissors and simply be careful with them. If you're careful they'll be quicker and much more pleasant for the nose and nearly as quick for the ear.One more thing: That first review ('glorious') with so many 'helpful' checks seems way planted.
4,GOOD,"This is a pretty good nose hair clipper...It gets the job done, but like other people have said..there is a little pulling and may feel awkward once in awhile when it does that..That's why I'm not giving it a 5 star, but a 3.5 to 4 star cause of that..BUT it does do the job."
3,Works well but it is fragile,"This product served me well for about 9 months and then I dropped it on the bathroom floor. It still works but is very, very loud. For something people will use in the bathroom it is too fragile. If you buy it I would consider it a disposible item. As others pointed out it really does the job well trimming nose and ear hair. You really can rinse it under water without it breaking. Just don't drop it."
1,It only lasted 3 weeks!,"I only used it a couple of times and then it stopped working. Given this is a really simple device, maybe that's why it's so inexpensive."
1,"Finally, a grooming device for Bob Flanagan","If you like the feeling of hair being violently ripped from your nostrils by a dull rotating blade, this is the device for you.I purchased this thing after reading the reviews and having general success with most panasonic products. I am extremely disappointed and cannot recommend this product."
5,Wonderful,"Finally, a personal groomer that works. I have bought (and subsequently returned) 5 personal groomers; this is the only one which performed as advertised. Thanks Panasonic! My wife and my nose thank you!"
2,Works but hurts,"I decided to buy the groomer after I have read so many positive reviews about it on amazon. The groomer works and trims the hairs fairly short. However, from the first time I tried it it hurt and tickled at the same time. That is the strangest sensation. The groomer pulls hair often... very often... continuously... The combination of pulling hair and tickling makes your eyes water. My old scisors were sharper and I had to be more careful with them, but at least they don't pull my nose hair."
1,Not Recommended!,"It worked great (although it could be painful), the TWO times I used it. Then it died. A piece of junk. I had one of these a few years ago, and it only lasted a few months. Look for something better."
2,Is it my nose hair?,I have gone through two of these things. Once I dropped it and it broke apart like a piece of crystal.The second one just died after less than a month of use.LOL!Be careful you get what you pay for.
2,"worked great at first, but not now","At first this worked great, but after a few months the RPMs went way down, and I don't know how to make it run properly anymore. (Changing batteries and cleaning it don't help much.) When it's spinning slowly, it pinches and doesn't do a very good job."
3,Seemed okay at first then...,"Okay, so I buy this online because I'm too embarrassed to admit I have a massive hedge-like formation that has cropped up on the inside rim of my nostrils and I don't want to go into a store and let some 16 year old babe in low rise jeans see me buy it. I get it home, take it out of the box and put it to work. Side A (the left) goes reasonably smoothly though there is this wierd aroma of frying hair as I pump the thing in and out of my nostril. I switch to side B and it really seems to go haywire flaying open the skin and tugging the hairs out so viciously that I got tears running down my face. I stumble out of the bathroom and my woman sees me bleeding crying and looking all confused and she says 'youre on coke again aren't you?' So I'm like 'no!' but I cant stop screwing my face up because the hair that got pulled out tweaked something in my face and it just stings so much. Anyway, I'd recommend it."
1,"I read the reviews here, but I got a lemon","I purchased this product and it just doesn't work. There are few things more frustrating that placing a whirring cutting device into your nose and ears, and then waiting for it to do its job, trying every angle, all to no effect. I think the device's little blade is too far down the safety nozzle for it to do anything useful for me. Your clipeage may vary."
1,Ouch,"The reviews seemed good, but I've found that the unit really hurts! Yowch! It pulls as it cuts, and stings like heck.Perhaps it's defective, bad blade, or somesuch - visual inspection seems okay, but this is certainly NOT the way it's designed to work."
1,I'll go back to using a WAHL brand trimmer ...,"For almost twenty dollars (thirty dollars list, according to Amazon ...), I thought this might be a pretty good trimmer. And the reviews seemed good, so I bought one. Well, I tried several new batteries in the trimmer, but it still nicked and cut when I tried it. Not for tender noses! ... the thing hurts and leave red inflamed marks on tender skin. I really just can't stand to use it at all ... I fear it's going to draw blood. It might be OK on ears, but I don't need it for that. It's also of flimsy construction and I'm afraid that if I once accidentally dropped the thing on bathroom floor or countertop, that would be the end of it. I much preferred my old Wahl brand trimmer, which did a good job, never hurt, has been durable and lasted years -- and Wahl costs less! The Panasonic is OUT and I'm going to buy another Wahl brand."
1,Nose & Ear Hair Groomer can't Groom Nose & Ear Hair!!,This product is absolutely powerless - very difficult if not impossible to groom Nose & Ear hair
5,WOW - IT REALLY WORKS!!,"I was worried that this wouldn't work as well as the reviews said it would. But it does! Say goodbye to the tweezers. If all panasonic grroming products work this well, I may just have to give up my razor as well!"
2,Low quality metal,"I used the trimmer for about 6 months, it worked great in that it cut the hair down very nicely, but it had a couple of downsides.1. It would get very warm and and some times pull2. When I dropped it, the cap came of very easily and the head hit the ground.(I thought the cap was supposed to protect it?) Anyway I tried to mess with it to make it keep spinning but nothing I did help, I only dropped it a foot of the ground onto a carpet floor."
2,Worked Great....at first....,"Mine worked wonders at first. But like a bunch of other reviewers it just quit one morning. I tried washing the tip but now it just makes an awful racket when I can get it to work. The blades seem very fragile. It appears after some usage the blades gum up and get distorted. It doesn't take much to make it quit. I don't expect it to last forever, but I did expect it to last longer than it did. I'll be looking for a different product as a replacement."
2,poor quality,Mine quit working after about a year of light use. Not the best cutting blade either - tended to tug rather than cut cleanly.
1,Not worth Buying,"I was very disappointed with this video. I'm not sure who it is aimed at, but I found it to be useless. It would start a description of something and show an entrance through a portal or window. I expected the entrance would open to a deeper discussion to the topic that had just been introduced, but no... the entrance led to a new topic (or I should say another introductory statement about a different topic). That happened over and over again for the whole video. I do not recommend this video to anyone!"
5,"thourough, motivating,easy to foolow",exceptional teaching video. a reminder...there are 2 discs. i wish there was a book to go with this video. some of us are 'by the word' learners. is there one coming? also inspires me to organize my studio.
4,Quite an Undertaking,I thought this book was amazing! Imagine a widow with five little kids trying to make it on her own and having to work as an Undertaker! She is an inspiration to me. I really couldn't put this book down until it was finished.
1,STILL WAITING,I ordered this item on Sept 24 and should have recieved it now later than the 19th of Oct. here it is 10/27 my credit card has been charged for the item and I still have not recieved it. I did notify the company and still am waiting for my item.
2,It was Jive,"I love detrick Haddon's music, and i especially loved the chainbreaker cd, but every song, with the exception of number four, wasn't meeting the quota. Mabye his next cd will be good, but this one was disappointing for 16. Don't take it personally, i still love the brother's music."
3,"Good, not Great","Being a life long Strat-O_Matic player, this game intrigued me. The opportunity to play any player, any season was appealing. The GM aspect and pre-game managing of your lineup is great. The game suffers in game play. Animations are cheesey, and the ball parks don't change. I understand that there is a way to change the stadiums, I just haven't figured it out yet. Stolen bases are 50-50 at best, and pitchers always seem to fall apart in the later innings. Also, a dominant closer means nothing as of yet, as every closer I've used so far has managed to blow quite a few saves. The encyclopedia function is also interesting, and saving season stats is cool once you figure it out. Overall, not a bad game for $20, but I'll stick to Strat for realism."
1,baseball mogul 2008,Do not waste your money. This game is not like mlb for playstation or other consoles. you have really no control of nothing. All you do is click the mouse. No actual game play as catching or running or even batting controls and not even pitching. It simulates and shows no simulation at all. If you could rate an item with no stars then this is the game. No fun at all.
5,Great link from airport express or macbook to audio receiver,"This cable works as advertised - it looks and feels like it costs much more than it actually does. Audio quality is excellent. I use it to hook anApple Airport Expressto my receiver for excellent quality sound via Airplay.Pros:+ Inexpensive+ Excellent quality sound+ Works well with Apple products (Airport express, most Apple laptops)Cons: None"
3,Cheap feel..works..,I looks decent...feels cheap...build quality is questionable...but it works fine on my XBOX 360 to Creative sound card in my desktop...nice and long...nothing much else to say.
5,Great product! Fast shipping.,This is my first use of an optical cable. It is pretty cool technology. This particular cord is high quality and exactly what I needed. It is fun to listen to music and watch movies with digital sound!
3,loose mini jack,"This is the second time I ordered this product-- I ordered a shorter length first, then a 2nd longer one. It seems a high quality product. However, the mini plug on the second, longer cable is very loose in the socket. It is transmitting the signal but seems like it could just fall right out. This first one fit snugly. Maybe I just got a bad one. I'm debating whether to exchange it."
3,Stylish good quality cable with a problem.,"This is probably the prettiest and best quality cable you will find of the type. The connectors are large but I have had no problem connecting them to any of my devices, Including an XBOX 360, which has a round hole around the Optical Out that is just the size to allow this cable to fit.Major problem is that the outer part of the plugs are lose and rotate freely of the plug and cable. This makes it rather difficult to line up the Toslink end of the cable with a Toslink port.That problem together with the price of this cable, leads me to suggest that if you care not for trivial aesthetics, to just purchase a cheap Toslink-to-3.5mm Optical Mini Plug Adapter in conjunction with a higher quality Toslink-to-Toslink cable to achieve the same goal. And unlike this cable, the Toslink-to-Toslink cable can be used with any other application that requires a TOSLINK cable."
1,Does not work,"Great idea, but does not work. Tried this cable with a LG 55LM7600 with no success. Returned for a refund."
4,Does what it says on the tin,Worked as advertised for a couple months. Tripped over the cable and bent the mini end. The signal still works but I can tell it's about to fall apart.
2,Cables To Go 27017 Velocity Toslink-to-Optical Mini Plug Digital Cable (3 Meters),"The cable is great quality, however, it does not work for what I ordered it for. I need a female side where I can plug it into my Bose Noise Acoustic Canceling headphones. Also, the other end it does not fit into the Sony Bravia Optical digital slot."
5,Works as expected...,"I purchased this cable to connect my MacBook Pro optical (digital)audio to my home theater receiver. So far it is working fine. Although Apple provides this output on most of their laptops, finding this cable takes some work."
5,Does it's job and does it well.,I bought this so I can connect my Unibody MacBook with my Bose home theater.Work's like a charm.The cable is thick (but not too thick) and the ends attach well to the MacBook and the Bose.Tested it out by playing Batman Returns Blu-Ray @ 5.1 channel. Works perfectly.
4,Purchased another after several years,"I purchased my original MT-500, I'm guessing five to six years ago. I like it's look and the fact it's under 14"" high. The carafe is nice. I can get a cup over an hour later and it's still hot and tastes fresh. The water gauge on the right side is a little tough to see for right-handed people pouring in the water but it works. My original started to leak water from the bottom of the water gauge about six months ago and I've been looking for a new coffee maker off and on since then but no coffee maker seemed to stand out. They all had problems either failing quickly or leaking when making coffee. This one never leaked coffee and my wife had one as well. They've both lasted roughly six years. The MT-600 reviews weren't good so I looked for this one again and ended up getting it. Maybe in five to six years some manufacturer will figure out how to make a good coffee maker that has a carafe, doesn't leak or fail within the first few years and I'll get it."
4,Great coffee maker,"We bought this over a year ago and really enjoy it for the following reasons:1- the carafe is not scalding hot, so our kids have never burned their fingers2- the carafe keeps the coffee hot, but not scalding hot, so we never burn our tongues. The coffee comes out at the perfect temp.3- The carafe keeps the coffee hot for a long time4- It has a timer, so the coffee is made by the time I stumble into the kitchen5- You can set the carafe on your table at breakfast and leave it there, it will not get cold. You can read your paper and not have the hassle of getting up and down.We are very satisfied with this purchase and use it every day!!!"
3,Capresso - good but not great,"Given a choice, I'd rather have good coffee brewed in a bad coffee maker than bad cofee brewed in a good coffee maker. The point is that while I like the Capresso, buying good coffee to put into it is more important - it cant make bad coffee taste good. I like the machine for its quick and quiet brewing, and stylish appearance. The special heating element that does not deteriorate will become more important when the machine ages. I found that the caraffe mechanism is ""finicky"". If it is not arranged just right or if there are some coffee grounds in the way the coffe can drip over the top of the caraffe. Other than that it is a fine machine. I hope the price buys me several years of good service, otherwise I think I'd be better off buying a new cheaper machine every two years."
1,Shoddy Packing Arrived Broken,"I have been shopping with Amazon since 1997 and recently decided to purchase a couple kitchen appliances. I just received this coffeemaker and was chagrined that the company doesn't do a better job in packing and securing a $170 coffeemaker. The appliance box is packed in a larger brown box with an airpack strip. One side of the appliance box is in direct contact with the thin outer box and the appliance box jiggles inside and can easily get banged around in transit. It arrived broken on the bottom. Additionally, the coffeemaker itself was not wrapped in plastic and the electric cord was not wrapped and tied. This leads me to believe that I may have been shipped a returned item. Seems like there may be a quality control issue as well. I had also purchased a KitchenAid blender, same packing story. In the future I'll pay retail to avoid the hassle of a return, or shop for breakables at another discount source."
1,a really terrible coffee maker,"what a great gift. a coffee maker that has so many problems that it's hard to know where to start. The controls-absolutely worthless because the they are horizontal and not readable unless you walk up to them and look down-not what I do at 5 am.The flooding-yes others have said that it's not the pot's fault.Well,boohickie. It IS the coffeemaker's fault. I've set my grinder at midrange and it still gets clogged in the the drip chute. Forget buying preground coffee-you can't buy fine ground coffee and expect your counter to stay dry. Is it overpriced-absolutely. As I like tepid coffee, I will not join others and say it is not hot enough. I will say that I am sick of the daily sludge at the bottom of my coffee cup-that doesn't happen with my $30 coffee maker at my summer camp. This coffee maker is a yuppie disaster."
5,Capresso 440.05,"Unit is solidly made, with few moving parts. Easy to add the water, easy to remove and replace coffee basket. Carafe keeps it hot for over an hour, but not the four hours claimed. Very pleased with this unit."
5,A fine machine,"Purchased this unit to replace 8 year old Capresso machine. Fully expect the same quality of performance from this one, and so far I'm very pleased."
4,Good Machine!,"We had a Starbucks Barista machine before which we liked but it started leaking after six years... This machine does everything that one did though it does not hold as much coffee. The carafe, however, does keep the coffee hot for three hours. I was amazed.Everything about its construction is rugged and reliable and clean up is easy. Also has the filter which is nice so you don't have to keep descaling.I bought it because it won a reward as best value from Wall Street Journal and I figure those guys drink a hell of a lot of coffee..."
2,Good coffee but carafe does not keep it hot.,"We purchsed the Capresso coffee maker a couple years ago and were willing to make the investment for a really good coffee maker. I buy coffee directly from a coffee roaster so I like a good, full-bodied coffee. I got a flavorful cup of coffee and, initially, the coffee stayed hot in the the thermal carafe for maybe two hours. Now, the carafe does not keep the coffee hot at all even when I preheat it with scalding hot water. I called the company and they will sell me a replacement cafafe for about the same cost of the newer model Capresso. I said ""no, thanks."" They lost my business as I continue my quest for a coffee maker that keeps the coffee hot after it is brewed. The thermal carafe lid is also somewhat difficult to open for pouring the coffee."
1,Floods of Coffee,"This pot will flood your counters with coffee, and dont believe those who say it can be solved. I have looked at reviews for most of the good coffee makers and this is the only one that has this problem (30 out of 97 reviewers!). Epinions/mySimon all have the same response. Called Capresso and they pretended they had never heard of the problem - BUNK! Mine is going in teh trash today - Capresso never again!!!!"
1,Extremely Disappointed,"Never know what to expect from this thing. One time it makes coffee, the next it pumps water and coffee all over my kitchen counter. The coffee tastes the same as my old 29.99 Mr. Coffee so I can't even say anything good about it when it doesn't flood my kitchen. Not worth the money at all."
1,My Wife Hates it!!,It sounded great from the description. I'm very dissapointed. It does not keep coffee hot for more than a half an hour. You need a magnifiying glass to read the water level. It was purchased as a surprise to my wife. She wants to give it to the Salvation Army! I liked the thermos idea but it just doesn't work on this machine. BUY ANOTHER BRAND!!!
3,Takes getting used to,Brews too fast and makes the coffee weak even if I use a finer grind and more coffee. I had to plug two of the three holes that lets the water out of the top and use MORE coffee to be able to get a full bodied cup of coffee. I do like the temperature much better than other coffee makers. I wish I did not have to use so much more coffee to get the taste I like
3,"Great coffee, but lots of room for improvement.","I've owned this coffee maker for about a year. I only had one overflow and that was when I forgot that I'd left the ""preheat"" hot water in the carafe when I started the brewing. Nevertheless, I agree with many of the other reviewers. The numbers on the quantity indicator on the reservoir are barely discernable. The black dot on the black lid is just plain silly. It is necessary to preheat the carafe in order to have hot coffee so that the automatic timer is useless (and the little clock ceased to function after just a couple of months). Capresso offered to have me send the unit to them for repairs, but I'd have been without my coffee maker for two or three weeks and so I passed.OK, that's the worst of it. The coffee is wonderful - as good as any I've had. For the VERY high price, Capresso ought to correct the flaws."
3,Time to say goodbye,"We've had the Capresso 10 cup Thermal Carafe for about 18 months now. At first I was satisfied with the coffee flavor. This was, in retrospect, a bit of wishful thinking on my part and being unwilling to admit that we had spent so much for so little. This machine just did not heat the water to a high enough temperature to extract the coffee's full flavor. And, since a carafe does not heat, this just-warm coffee could be stored for up to 4 hours. Why bother? Capresso must simply come up with a better water heating element. Also, the fill gauge is difficult to see - especially with sleepy eyes.All in all, this Capresso model looks much better than it functions. We're very disappointed and are going back to the basics with a much simpler machine.Drop this rating to 1 star."
3,"Great coffee, poor value","I agree with a previous reviewer who gave this machine a 3.5. Makes excellent coffee. But way overpriced, especially when a good percentage of the machine is plastic. Coffee temp is not an issue. Believe me. I have a second-degree burn on my hand to prove it. Seriously. But that brings me to the carafe. Poor design on the lid makes pouring very slow. There is a barely visible dot that is supposed to be lined up with the spout. If you go past the dot at first it only pours slower and if you turn the lid even further, it will fall off, spilling coffee. Hence the burned hand.I won't be returning this but if it broke tomorrow I wouldn't buy another one either.PROS:Excellent coffee taste.Easy to use and very legible controls.Built-in charcoal filter for use of non-filtered water.Stylish.Carafe avoids burner-ruined taste.CONS:Cost.Pouring spout.Non-removable reservoir."
5,BEST COFFEEMAKER EVER!,"I HAVE HAD SEVERAL COFFEEMAKERS, KRUPS, MR. COFFEE, QVC'S BRAND, AND THIS IS THE FIRST ONE I HAVE EVER OWNED THAT MAKES COFFEE THAT TASTE LIKE IT HAS BEEN BREWED IN THE FINEST COFFEE HOUSE, EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT USING REALLY EXPENSIVE BEANS. I JUST CANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS MACHINE. THE EASE OF CLEANING IS A SNAP. IT IS SLEEK AND BEAUTIFUL, AND BEST YET, IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY ALUMINUM ONLY STAINLESS STEEL, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY THE COFFEE TASTES SO GOOD ALONG WITH THE FILTER TOO. I STILL USE A NATURAL COFFEE FILTER TO GET RID OF EVEN MORE SETIMENTS. I CAN ASSURE ANY TRUE COFFEE LOVERS, THE PRICE MAY SEEM STEEP, BUT IT IS CHEAP, TO GET THE KIND OF COFFEE THIS MACHINE MAKES. IT ALSO KEEPS IT HOT FOR A PRETTY LONG TIME, AND THE COFFEE IS VERY HOT WHEN YOU FIRST MAKE IT. GOOD LUCK!"
1,Prepare for coffee all over your counter,"This coffee machine does a nice job of brewing coffee quickly and delivering a good taste. However, it is overpriced, and no matter how careful you are about positioning the carafe, you are going to having coffee, coffee, everywhere! I've had the machine less than two years, and I've replaced almost every part and still coffee often flows all over my counter. The frustrating thing is, I can't figure out why it flows all over the place sometimes and not on other times. So forget about using the automatic timer! The pause feature also didn't work after about six months. You pull the carafe out and, more coffee on your counter. As soon as I finish the last box of charcoal filters I bought for it, I'm throwing the machine away."
1,Disappointed,"The carafe holds only 5 cups of water, not 10. Condensation drips from the filter holder down the pot. I don't like black indicators on black backgrounds which the pot lid has. I haven't brewed any coffee yet because the water level indicator has me puzzled. When I poured 4 cups of water in to activiate the charcoal filter, the level indicator showed 7 cups. The steam and noise it makes is excessive. I hope the coffe is as good as other reviewers have indicated to make me feel better about my purchase."
2,Luke Warm Coffee,"I had this coffee maker for 2 1/2 years before it just gave up and stopped making coffee last week. I would gladly pay this type of premium for better coffee but this machine is not worth it. First and most importantly, the coffee is never hot. As others have written, every cup has to go in the microwave for 35 seconds if you like your coffee hot. We often have guests and if I forget to show them the little dot on the top, they spill coffee all over...embarrassing for them and a mess for me. I was glad when it died. Back to Braun, non-programmable machine at $14.99...the coffee is hot and tastes great again. It's the beans, not the maker, that seem to matter."
4,Great coffee - High Price,I am sitting here enjoying my 2nd cup of French Roast after getting the coffee maker yesterday. It tastes great and just like it does from my favorite coffee shop where I bought the coffee. I knew when I purchased the unit it was high priced and it is way over priced. Its not made in the USA but atleast its not made in China. I agree with other reviews that the caraffe is not the best. It pours coffee very slow. Unlike my last coffee maker it does brew a whole lot faster. It is twice as fast and that is good for the flavor of the coffee. The beans are not over brewed. Overall it is a great machine but could be half the price. Now I am waiting for my Baratza Maestro Plus Burr Coffee Grinder to come in the mail and I will be all set.
2,Hot its not,I did everything I could to get this coffee maker to make hot coffee. I ran the thermos under hot water and filled it with hot water before I brewed my coffee but the coffee was not hot. By hot I mean it was readily drinkable. I even heated up my coffee mug. The coffee in my old Krups is hotter. I did not notice any difference in the taste between the Krups and the Capressa and I was using $12 a pound coffee.
2,Carafe doesn't keep coffee warm,"I've owned this coffee maker for about a year. I bought it based on reviews on this website. It was a disappointment. The carafe DOES NOT keep the coffee warm very long. I make a pot around 6:00 am. By 7:00 or so, I'm having to heat my cup of coffee in the microwave to get it hot enough to drink. I would like it to keep the coffee a good hot drinking temperature for at least a couple of hours. This one does not.Also, after a years use, it has now started ""spitting"" steam on every brew. I've cleaned it three times now and it hasn't helped. I start out with 8 cups of water in the tank and wind up with about 7 cups of coffee, not to mention, it is very noisy when it's hissing away all the steam.I will say, it brews a good cup of coffee. If it would just stay hot in the carafe."
2,Not worth the money,Disappointed in the value of this coffeemaker. There's no technology in this thing to make it worth the money. I made the purchase because of reviews that stated how hot the coffee was (etc) but found it to be simply average. Would definitely return it if I still had the packaging.
4,We Love the Coffee!,"After wasting $200 on 2 Cuisinart coffee pot's that didn't last long we researched this Capresso and based on the reviews bought one. It does make a great cup of coffee and that's the bottom line for us. We have had no problems with dripping, or warm coffee. Sometimes we have a cup late in the day and the coffee that's left over still takes good.Yes, I agree with most that the Coffee Pot is pricey. In the long run I would have saved money if I had gotten the Capresso before I bought the Cuisinart's."
2,"Stainless on the outside, but plastic reservoir on the inside","When searching for a plastic-free coffeemaker, I read recommendations which said that this model had a stainless water tank. It doesn't! We haven't used it, but it is going back and we'll keep looking."
3,Great coffee maker - poor coffee keeper,"The comments below are based on 3 months of daily use.This is a great coffee maker. It's a shame the carafe (the keeper) isn't as capable as the rest of the machine. For the price, I would expect a well-designed carafe that would keep the coffee hot for at least 2 hours. In reality, if you don't drink it within the first hour, serious heat loss will keep you from fully enjoying the great coffee the brewer produces.The flaw seems simple enough - poor carafe insulation. You can quickly feel heat on the outside of the carafe after making a fresh pot (if you can feel it on the outside, it's gone from the inside). I would also like to see the carafe with a more clearly marked top (pouring position), larger lid tabs to make it easier to open, and an improved pour flow rate (pretty slow)."
5,Super coffee,"I bought this unit on the basis of other reviews and find that it is easy to use and makes really good coffee. I like pretty strong coffee and was worried that the suggested grind and amounts would be too weak, but the brew was quite tasty. I haven't had any problem with the lid to the thermal carafe, as others have reported. And the stainless steel look with the benefit of cool touch technology is very nice. Highly recommend."
3,Not impressed with the Carafe,"Nice coffee maker, looks good, makes good coffee, but the carafe loses a lot of heat. After sitting with fresh coffee for about ten minutes it is almost too hot to touch the outside, that heat is being lost by the coffee. I find it very hard to believe it will keep the coffee warm for 4 hours."
1,MT500 DOES overflow and gets worse over time.,"Sorry, I am a coffee snob and did a lot of research. I was torn between the MT500 and Technivorm. I went for the Capresso due to the metal parts and filter. After 3 years, I can't wait to throw it in the trash. There is nothing worse than overflowing coffee. If it hasn't happened to you just wait.I have ordered a Technivorm."
5,Great coffee - great looking machine,"I was a little wary of paying this much for a coffee maker but I've had this one for the last month and I love it. It looks great - and is very functional. Easy to use, easy to clean, and the optional filter is a great option. I was a little worried about the people that complained about the ""dripping"" from the pot but I haven't seen that issue yet. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and would buy it again."
5,Carafe cleaning made easy,"I've owned this coffee maker for over a year, and am delighted with it. I've had no problems or difficulties whatsoever with it.How to clean the carafe: rinse it with hot water, add about 1/8 teaspoon of dishwasher detergent (e.g. Cascade), fill carafe with hot water, and let soak for a while. After a year, my carafe is as clean as the day it came out of the box."
1,WARNING: Do NOT order anything from this company!,"Please save yourself the headache and avoid purchasing anything from Kismet. We ordered the Capresso coffee maker (170.00) and were unhappy with the product. We have been calling everyday for the last 15 days to speak with a representative to either replace or return the device. Not certain if the maker of Capresso product is aware of this or if they are one in the same with Kismet. Regardless, I will avoid both for now.TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!"
2,If Only Performance Matched Looks,"This coffee maker looks like art on a kitchen counter. But I had two major complaints with it after a year of service. If the carafe were not put on the coffee maker, or if it were misaligned, the coffee would brew and I would wake up to a small lake of coffee on the counter, in the drawers below, on the floor, you get the picture. Much less expensive makers are more idiot proof than this ... one. Then, the water pump stopped working after 50 weeks of service. I think I will stick with the $50 coffee makers from now on."
3,"Handsomely designed, not well designed","My husband and I registered for this coffee maker for our wedding mostly because it looked great. It has attractive lines, the brand has a good reputation, and the thermal carafe means no more burnt coffee. As it turns out, it makes good coffee, but the carafe is difficult to clean, and its lid even more so. I simply have not found a way to get the carafe and lid completely clean without leaving some kind of aftertaste in the coffee -- and I've tried quite a few things."
1,nightmare customer service,"although I feel this is a great product. I just does not last. The customer service of Bradley and his boss Sylest leaves much to be desired. So after just over 6 months, with no help from the company I will buy from [...]. they have a forever return policy. Capresso just needs customer service that listens more than speaks"
2,"Incredibly Poor at Any Price, Especially $170","I really, really can't believe that they are charging $170 for this machine which, at best, is a glorified Mr. Coffee with some steel slapped on. Besides the price, by far the biggest problem is that the coffee is only luke-warm even if you pour it the second it is done, (don't think of using the ""sneak a cup"" feature to get one before it stops because that doesn't work either. The carafe is also a nightmare as it is exasperatingly slow to pour out of even if you unscrew to the point of the top coming off and there is no way to clean the dried coffee from the bottom of the carafe through its very narrow opening. Really, you don't ask so many things from a coffee machine that it should have this many problems, especially at this premium price. A classic example of decent form over very bad function."
3,Get a Bunn,"Too expensive and nothing special. Wish I had gotted the Bunn as I intended, before I read all these glorious reviews. At least, when the power goes off, I could still make a pot of hot coffee with the Bunn.10/12 Lasted two/three years, then started leaking water underneath, as many of the internet reviewers noted same thing happened to them."
4,a suprise failure,This product makes good coffee and keeps it drinkable in the stainless carafe. We like all of that! We left the carafe partially full when we went to sleep and the following morning our house guest made the morning pot. He was unaware the carafe was partially full and when he added his amount of water it exceeded the carafe's capacity and the liquid spilled on the computer pad causing the unit to shut down. After a drying out period the unit started to work again. Bewildered about all this and would caution users to this potential problem.
4,Only one little complaint,"I'm very happy with the coffee I'm getting from this coffee maker and am very picky about my coffee, grind it fresh every pot, etc. I'm especially pleased it does keep it hot enough for the two of us to have hot coffee even though we often pour our first cups an hour apart - which was my impetus for upgrading to thermal carafe. However, it's quite awkward to pour the water into the tall water recepticle and simultaneously watch the water fill to the right capacity marker, partly because of design and partly because the numbers are SO SMALL. Somehow we manage though and I recommend in spite of the steep cost."
3,Great Coffee lousy Carafe,The cofee brews quickly and the taste is great. The carafe is difficult to pour and the coffee often spills out and the carafe is awkward and hard to handle.
1,Makes cold coffee,"We are very disappointed with the Capresso coffee maker. Unless we rinsed the carafe with hot water and used hot water to brew the coffee immediately, then we would end up with luke warm coffee. We would have to drink the coffee immediately since the carafe could not keep the coffee warm for over 30 minutes. Using the automatic timer was therefore useless.After waking up morning after morning to automatically brewed semi cold coffee, I went out and bought a Cuisinart stainless steel 12cup automatic coffee maker which brews hot excellent coffee automatically with no hassles. The Capresso is all looks and with no capability."
1,Design flaws aplenty.,"I'm typing this after boxing it for a return. The coffee isn't nearly hot enough, and cools quickly in the carafe. They suggest adding boiling water before brewing, but how practical is that if you're setting it to auto brew the night before? Further, the lid to the carafe becomes stuck-I cannot open the thing right now.Did the folks that gave this a high rating buy a different machine?"
4,Great coffee maker,"This coffee maker has a lot going for it...thermal carafe so coffee stays hot without burning, makes great tasting coffee, easy to program, great looking on the counter. Downsides: quite noisy when it is making coffee, no measurement marks on the carafe to help gauge amount of water putting in the tank. But those are small nitpicks...overall it was worth every penny!"
4,Sherif M. Osman,"I bought this item for my father in low, so i didn't use it personally, but so far he seems to be happy with it..:):):)"
3,Nas is like.......,"Ok,i haven't bought the Cd yet,but im not planning to.The reason? I've only heard one song:Hate Me Now.It's ok,but if he rolls wit Fluff 'N Puff Daddy he's got problems.Puff is like an embarrassment like Vanilla Ice now.East Coast is good,but BIG was the only good Bad Boy rapper that was and always will be.Tupac and Biggie were equal.Puff 'N Mase r just ""entertainers"" and aren't part off the game."
4,"The Cd was good, but I expected a little more from Nas","I liked the Cd and would definately suggest buying it, but after hearing some of the cuts that were on the bootleg Cd I expected Nas to come a little tighter than he did. Right now I would Nas is the best lyricist in the business but I don't think this is one of his best works."
2,Nas to my @**..,"This cd sucks. Joints produced by DJ Premo are dope but the rest of them iz wack. Hate Me Now is the worst song i've heard in a while. There won't ever be another Illmatic. Exit Nas Escobar! C'mon, enter NASTY NAS!! This moneymaking cd ain't worthwhile.. This album is even worse than It Was Written!!"
5,I AM is by far his best album,"this album is by far his best, i am a true fan of nas and throughout the years, he has represented the true essence of hip-hop, not the imitation hip-hop(most of these people don't even know what hip-hop is), but nas-as gifted as ever did it again on this one. ghetto prisoners is one of the most prolific songs of all time. nas is indeed worthy of having his lyrics dissected like the true gifted writer he is. nas is more than just a rapper, his lyrics are that of a prophet. five star album indeed!"
4,Nas does it again,Nas is the 3rd greatest rapper next to biggie and tupac. This is probably his 2nd best cd next to ILLMATIC. You really can't do better than that cd.Best songs1.Small World(Best Nas song ever)2.Nas is like3.Favor for a Favor
1,Nas has dissapointed many by the release of this... um thing,This is something to be very unhappy about it is the worst album ive ever heard.
2,how does this compare to illmatic?,"i really respect nas. the man can rap with the best of them. but this latest album is just bullsh*t. the single 'nas is like' caught my attention the first time i heard it, and i thought damn, im going to have to pick this up. but after listening to it there are only about 4 or 5 songs worth listening to and the rest actually make me cringe. how in the hell do u go from 'nas is like', 'undying love', 'small world', and 'u wont see me tonight' (the latter three being love themed songs) to 'Kissing' and 'dr knockboot'? i mean, i really found it hard to believe that the man responsible for one of the best hip hop cd's of all time (illmatic) could put this out and be proud of it. songs like 'favor for a favor' and 'life is what u make it' are decent enough, but they also are about as cliched as it it gets. one can only hope that nastradamus is given some thought to and is worth my money when it comes out later this year."
1,One of the Biggest Dissapointments Ever,"From Illmatic to this? What was Nas thinking? I thought he was going to at least come better on I Am than he did on It Was Written but i was mistaken. The only good tracks are those produced by Primo and thats only 2 tracks. Failed attempts to use his lyrical talent towards money, clothes, and wips and very lackluster produced beats make this album not only a dissapointment for the year, but for all time. Hopefully Nas will come better on his follow-up coming out later this year. But for the time being, i will ""hate you now"""
1,Weak- he keeps slippin',"I went back into my crates and pulled out Illmatic. This latest album from Nas can't hold a candle to his first. It is just depressing. I listened to ""I am"" for a week and then put it away. Do not waste your money on this- all the good songs will make to the radio anyway. I keep waiting for the next great song or album from Nas."
4,mad album,nas is the greatest mc.this may not be his greatest album but still better than anything that ruff ryders jay-z or cash money could put out.still illmatic is his best but if you want a tight album pick this up and just sit back and listen.
2,Most rap aint that good anymore.,"Nas has some good beats but his lyrics are weak.NWA Straight Outta Compton and Snoop Doggy Dogg Doggystyle,Dr.Dre The Chronic,2Pac All Eyez On Me are better albums."
5,Do you know???,I can't seem to find anything about Nas and a song maybe called street dreamer (not from it was written) It features R. Kelly. If you know anything about it please write to me. ullavilhelmsen@hotmail.com Thankz....and by the way: Nas styrer lortet i r!!
3,Can get you hype but can't keep the party going forever!!!,"Once again another has made an attempt to call him/herself the greatest!!! Not, the Nas cd is pretty phat for the summer but i can only put in my collection amongst the others that i will one day pull out and say ""that was my jam in 19??"" Don't get me wrong its hot but it can not be a classic and i think that Nas needs to go back and figure out what made Illmatic so hype and a definite 5......."
2,Nas is falling off fast!,"Nas' third opus is questionable. His style is not the same as ""Illmatic"" and ""It Was Written"". He is so commercial now. But this album is'nt all bad. Tracks like the DJ Premiere produced ""Nas Is Like"" and N.Y. State Of Mind"" are standouts. What Happened to QB's finest!"
4,Pretty Good Cd,"I've had this cd for a few years, but listened to it this evening after downloading some other material that Nas has put out on his Lost Tapes and the new God's Son. While Illmatic was classic, and all of his other stuff will seem like he has fallen off while compared to it, the I Am cd is pretty good. Favor for a Favor with Scarface is a classic track, and so is Nas is Like. And while Nas did fall off a little with Nastradamus, it looks like he turned it around with Stillmatic, and God's Son is gonna be hot too. He's one of the best lyricists in the game today, and the battle with Young Hova just brings the best out of the both of them."
3,3.5 Stars,"I Am... is one of the albums Nas released during the bling bling era, and is not one of my favorite Nas albums, but it still has great production and great lyricism. MUST HAVE."
5,Short of illmatic but solid,i got this album the first day i came out and i still play it today fits perfectly in my collection of nas cd's go get this one10 of 10 lyrics 8.5 of 10 beats
2,WHY ME?,"I could had brought something more constructive wit my $15.00. This cd dissapointed me. I fell to sleep after track #3. But tracks 13,14,15,and 16 are tight. That is one-third of an album,I should had paid $5.00 for it."
4,A GREAT CD THAT ANYONE WHO LIKES RAP SHOULD BUY!!!!!!!,"The new Nas CD is off the hook! It features people like DMX, Puff Daddy, Aaliyah, and Scarface. The songs are great with these artists in them! The only problem that I have with the CD is that it seems like he threw in some songs at the end of his album that really suck! But, reguardless, there is still 5 or 6 songs on there right now that I rock in my car. There is gonna be more that I'll pull off of there soon. Peace."
3,what happned,"all u ppl givin it 5 stars dont know what hip-hop is. Illmatic was one of the best hip-hop albums ever. If nas would go back to the production he had on that, this would have been a hit. What ever happened to Pete Rock producing for nas. Pete Rock and prmeo were all over illmatic, and now premo only produced 2 songs that are both phat. If u ppl that said this is phat, pick up ill matic, and u'll hear some real origional hip-hop"
4,ITS good BUT IT AINT ALL THat,"NAS IS A TIGHT CD but it just gets boring. the tracks that i like is ny state of mind pt2, nas is like, money is my bitch, we will survive (dedicaded to BIG AND PAC) the last song(when he kills his girl and himself) And the song with aaliyah thats produced by timbaland. the rest of the tracks arent that good. its a tight cd but it wasnt ALL THAT"
4,It was tight,"I think NAS is ""DA BOMB"",and he need to get his props. His style changed alittle bit,but I like it. But personally, I like those old classic like ""If I Ruled The World"",or Who's World Is This"" I think everyone should get this album is the are a true NAS fan!"
2,"""It ain't hard to tell, the CD ain't all That""","Now I understand fully why Nas' first single ""Nas is like"" was released first. The DJ Premier (GANGSTARR) produced track is clearly the best beat on this otherwise mediocre album. DJ Premier makes the best tracks that suit Nas' flow. Why he didn't use him more is a mystery. Most of the production on this album was done by the Trackmasters. They should be called the wackmasters. I'm sorry but I'm 33 years old and I have been listening to Hip Hop since before they new what to call it, and this is not a great CD. I believed the hype and purchased it because I like his flow. But if the beats don't move me, I can't get into the lyrics. Out of the 3 Nas albums this is the worst. There is no enjoyment in buying a 15 track album with less than 4 decent cuts on it. Illmatic 4ever baby! Maybe the Oct 99 release of ""Nastradomous"" will be better. Then again it might be hard to tell!"
2,no no no not built for cuban links,"i was exspecting alot more from this cd! reakwon cd blows this one off the map,as far as classics.i think that nas got his heart broke some where along the line.that is what i take from this cd.not a lot of pure mc.in,just a lot of bit-- this ,and bit-- that!"
1,read this,yo was up every 1. i think that you should stop listening to Nas and start listening to Tupac. \ /\ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \/ \/est Cost
2,Dissapointing,"Nas's 3rd album ""i am..."" which i thought would be another classic, after, ""it was writting"" ? Fails very badly to the floor.1. intro 10/10 actullie brought back memoriz2.n.y. state of mind part 2 10/10 classic song3. hate me now 3/10 awfull horrible song made me almost lose faith in nas4. small world 7/10 0kay lirycs good beats5. we will survive 2/10 boring song6. ghetto prisoners 2/10 weak song wack beats7. you wont see me tonight 2/10 trashh idk wut the fu ck nas was thinkin8.i want to talk to you 2/10 good lirycs but terrible beats9. dr knock out 2/10 garbage10.life is what you make it 2/10 weak beats weak lirycs11. big things 2/10 truly dissapointin idk what nas was thinkin when he made diz track12.nas is like 10/10 classic song diz the nas i like13. k.i.s.s.i.n. 2/10 awfull song trash14. money is my bitch 2/10 trash15. undying love 6/10 tight beats but borin songYea nas sold out wid diz album and the other album nastradumbass... Truly dissapointin."
2,i remember how bad this disc was in '99,"i was just digging through some old cd's of mine and i found 'i am...'. i played it for old time's sake and then suddenly realized why i havent played this cd since '99. i am as disappointed listening to it again now as i was when i first bought it. the production is clean throughout the album, but amazingly cheesie. these beats are so pathetic and they're even worse in '05 because they sound so dated - unlike 'illmatic' and 'it was written', both of which came before 'i am...'.making it from the first track to the end of the cd is a painful process. im going to do what i should of done right after i bought this album...throw it out. i actually just put it in the garbage right now because i dont want to find it again in another 6 years and go through the same mistake of listening to it again.this is when hip hop turned to rap - garbage."
2,Is this a joke?,"First there was Ilmatic, one of the greatest mainstream rap albums ever. Nas then came with It Was Written, although not as good as his debut, still an extremely tight album. With this, the 3rd release from the ghetto child Nas, I Am stands as the worst of Nas' 4 albums. The beats are weak as hell, and there are only a few tracks on the disc that are even listenable, and even they get old after a few spins. This album is just another indication of where modern rap music is going - nowhere. If you are serious about rap music, want good lyrics and phat beats, you need to look no further than Kool Keith, it seems he's the only rapper with any innovation these days. Steer far away from this release from my former favorite rapper - NAS."
5,Real Hip Hop,"Nas is one of the best hip-hop artists out there right now in the industry, this album really shows his full talent and ability as an artist. Every track on this cd is banging from begining to end. I would recommend this cd to anyone that slightly enjoys real hip hop music from the streets."
2,Too Commercial,"Although Nas has a reputation far greater than most famous rappers, he exchanges his slick lyrics and backbeats for catchy samples that lack content. He finally decided to cash in. Get one of his first two albums."
3,A real good effort...but......,"Lets face the hard facts of life, this CD was only 60% of what it could have been. There are 4-5 really tight tracks the rest are fillers. Its sad but true, Nas hasn't come correct since Illmattic. Look back at the producers for Illmatic and compare to the current line up and you'll see what I'm saying.The sad part about it is the wasted talent. The track with Scarface could have been a whole lot better.I'm going back to my BeatStreet Soundtrack, to hell with all Rap after 1992."
5,HE'S BACK BIG TIME !!,"AFTER A CLASSIC DEBUT ALBUM ILLMATIC.. A SO SO SECOND ALBUM IT WAS WRITTEN.. NAS ESCOBAR IS BACK !! TO HIS ROOTS OF HIS FIRST ALBUM AND IT IS OFF THA HOOK !! THE TIGHTEST LYRICS.. THE BANGINEST BEATS BY PREMIRE, L.E.S, TIMBALAND AND OTHERS MADE THIS ALBUM THE BEST BY FAR THIS YEAR IN HIP HOP ..FAV CUTSHATE ME NOWWE WILL SURIVE A TOUCHING TRIBUTE TO TUPAC AND BIGGIEDR.. KNOCKBOOTKISSINGSMALL WORLDOVER ALL THIS IS THE BOMB DOESNT GET NO BETTER RIGHT NOW PICK IT UP FOLKS !!PEACE"
3,Nas tries out new style,"I give nas credit for his attempt at sounding like a Puff Daddy, but that is not what gave him the great reputation that he earned through his not so strong beats and great rhymes. He is in my opinion one of the greatest rappers of the 90's only if he quits the Puff Daddy beats and sticks with the Mobb Deep ghetto beats"
3,Nothing to brag about,"This album is no way near Illmatic. It Was Written was even better than this. Nas is still better than most rappers but I do not think it is fair to call him the greatest. The beats on this album are not incredible either. No doubt some of the beats are blazin, but most are water."
3,This is no where near as good as ILLMATIC,"This album was a disappoiontment. Nas needs to get away from Poke & Tone producing his songs. Every once and a while they'll throw a phat beat but they really hurt Nas' performance. Nas should just stick with DJ Premier because all of the songs Primo produces are good as hell. (Ex. Represent; Nas is like; New York State of Mind; Memory Lane) It seemed like he also fell into the rap game especially by teaming up with Puffy on the one very weak track. And if you know anything about rap, you know that puffy is ruining rap. Though there are a few good songs, Nas should try and go back to the way he was with his Queensbridge beats like in the classic ILLMATIC. Once again, another great rapper caught up in the money."
2,www.RebirthMag.com,"I've already reviewed this album on my afore-mentioned site, and seeing that it's average rating here is 4 stars is sickening. This is not classic Nas. Go back and listen to Illmatic, and then listen to I Am. I mean, what the hell. Go to our magazine site to see more of what I have to say."
4,off the hee-zee,"This album by Nas was tite. The beats on the album are SICK!!! Bomb songs are ""We Will Survive"", ""Ghetto Prisoners"" and others. That song w/ Puffy is cool but ain't the titest. Nas lyrical prowess shines, good job NASIR JONES!!"
4,Best Nas CD ever.,Nas did a great job on this new CD all the beats are tight and you know he can flow. Not a dissapointing track on here and you will really get your moneys worth. I gave it four stars cuz Krazie Bones CD is even better.
3,"IT WAS OKAY, WITH A FEW WELL PRODUCED SONGS.","The album was tight. But it lacks the amount of song with the same concept or taste. It's like Nas was trying to make an album that could be played at any occasion. Whether you were in a club, or if you wanted to hear some hard core hip hop, or if you just wanted to kick it and smoke. This appeals to a wider variety of people, but leaves many with only a few songs to listen to if they only like one versio of the songs, stated above."
3,waste of another bit of change,"this is the second most disappointed cd of all times the first being IT WAS WRITTEN. nas has lost that hunger he had on illmatic. the beats are whack and nas's feeble attempt to fix it with his word play makes it worse. if i had a choice to buy this album for 1 dollar i would pass. i dont know what nas is trying to do here but it sure isn't keeping his fans. perhaps he should stop worrying about his ice and jewels something we all know he has, and concentrate on his albums. this album is one for the trash"
3,Hot but not as hot as ilmatic.,Illmatic was an easy five. You think by knowing the industry even better know he would expand an that but didn't.
3,All I can say is N.Y. state of mind pt.II,"NY state of mind was one of my fav's of the Illmatic Cd and to hear him write more versus for this! ahhh! Nas is the man. He really went commercial with this one, guess he's trying to get payed like the others. AAliyah did bring flavor to:"" you want see me tonight"". Other tracks out shined the others like: ""Nas is Like"" (big up DJ. Premiere [premO! ]) and Dr, Knockboot (should have been longer). This CD had to grow on me at first, but I got use to it.Still miss the Illmatic NASoNe"
2,sel rightous crap,"Nas is one of those rappers that at times can be amazing, and at other times quite crap. Political intelect to stupid gansta thug imagery. Premier is king and his beats kick. Nas does justice to some tracks but cant match the mystic journeymen, black eyed peas or gangstarr"
4,Cant expect nothing else but Nas is proper,"Ask yourself this, is there a better ghetto narrator then Nas? I cant find one, true Track masters do get carried away, but when Nas speaks to me, all I hear is what he says. I dont get caught up in his beats cuz that aint what makes him. His lyrical skills come correct again. One thing I would have liked to see was his tribute to Pac and Biggie be spoken in Poem form, rather then rapped, just cuz read those lyrics, thats a poem son, a great one. But if your hatin on his choice of track masters, just think about what made Nas, its not his beats dog."
3,Excellent lyrics - average beats.,This album is OK but I really think Nas should have allowed Premier to produce more of the tracks. The two Premier produced tracks are the best. Come back to the stripped down real hip-hop beats Nas!
3,What's Nas Telling Me? I AM...,"...not hungry! The first Nas album was a classic, but now he's selling records on rep. His rap style is still the same, but what's the message? He compares himself to Rakim, but the ""R"" has subplots and hidden meanings. Then again, so did Nas once. The album does have hits, though. Like the song with Scarface, and Hate Me with Puffy. But was I the only person that noticed almost every chorus was the same? Money changes your outlook on life, and now Nas' life is superficial. It shows. It's a good album, but not what you would expect from a legend."
5,Great junior album,This cd is another great one for nas. He still using his rhythmic ways to produce nice beats to go along with his songs. I recommend this cd for anyone who likes to listen to someone who likes to listen to phat beats with phat rapping to back them up.
5,Nas is da bomb yo,His album just dropped and it is tight a f#@$ he got his talent back he hasnt fallen there no way he won't be no 1 on the billboard charts yo's
4,"It may be mainstream, but its still Nas","Here is Nas' first real attempt at a wider audience. This foray into the mainstrem just shows his widening scope on life. That is, his ideas expand as his horizons do. However, I liked the old Nas better. Illmatic was one of the best rap albums of all time, and It Was Written, while focusing on less traditional Nas material, was without a doubt a top-notch album as well. Now, Nas seems caught up in the same thing DMX has fallen prey to: constantly reaffiming how much money he has and how great he is. Certainly, he doesnt do it to the extent DMX does, but stil... The fact is, this is a solid album which is worth picking up. Just as Nas expands, so maybe his fans must do the same. After all, its still Nas...."
5,third straight classic!,"This was the first Nas album i ever bought. I will admit I didn't know what to expect I heard ""Hate Me Now"" and liked it so I went out and bought it. If I never bought this album to this day I would never know what real rap music is. The same day I bought this I listen to it 2 times straight through. This album has a little something for whatever type of rap fan you are. Some of the songs are fire and hard exe: ""Hate Me Now"", ""Favor for a Favor"". Some are laid back and have more of a story exe ""NY state of mind 2"", ""Small World"", ""undying love"" and some are deep exe: ""we will survive"", ""I want to talk to you"" and ""ghetto Prisoners"". All in all if you are new to Nas I think this is the first album you should get."
3,"ok,needs more work","I am,is a decent album,This album shouldve had more Dj Premier produced tracks.Tone and Poke mess ed up the cd,they did the same thing on the Noreaga.They undremined Nas' flow by adding over done beats.They made it seem like a Puff Daddy album.Nas' lyrical presence could not be made more clear.If you want an album,that has over done beats and great lyrics,this is it if you are looking for another Illmatic this isnt you're cd."
3,it is good but it can be better.,"This Nas album, is good ,but will not have the impact Illmatic,and it was written.Illmatic gave him respect,It was written gave him mainstream fame.if this wasnr a Nas album it wouldnt sell many.Nas'uncontested flow is present on the album,but dj Premier's brilliance isnt.He shouldve spent more time in the studio"
5,Great Album,"I only recently discovered my love for rap, so I am probably not the most qualified person to review this album, but I loved it. What I am discovering more and more is that every rap artist that comes out whether you love them or hate them brings something to the industry (unless of course they lack any originality). You have Eminem's humour, Dre's laid back beats, Jay-Z's wierd collaborations and Nas, who in my opinion provides not only great lyrics but beats which you can listen to anytime anywhere (well, maybe not anywhere). But nevertheless I can listen to this album over and over, my favourite tracks being 'Favor 4 a Favor', 'You won't see me tonight' and 'Undying Love'. Get this album it is worth every penny."
2,Sadly mediocre...,"This is Nasty Nas? Or even Nas Escobar? The illmatic lyricist that burst on the scene in 94 is long gone, according to this recent release. What we have in his place is a Puff clone. Sad. Avoid this album, I sold mine back after a week."
2,Its not Illmatic,"Nas, from the days of Illmatic i thought that this kid would rule hip hop. His lyrics and production was untouchable.Especially his lyrical skills, damn, this kid was god. the words that were coming from his mouth were straight knowledge. But now on ""I am"" the production was wack with the commercial trackmasterz and nas lyrical skills were good but not even close to what was on Illmatic. I was dissapointed with nas this time, despite "" Nas is like "" NY state of mind 2"" and "" Undying love"" this album was poor. Nas, please leave esco and come back to Nasty Nas. PS DMX is the worst rappper"
1,Worst album - Dissapointment,"Nas totally sold out. He fell away from the underground scene and found an unexcusable spot in the commercial mainstream. The commercial is trash, all they talk about is money, drugs and murder. But what really bothers me is the money money money money. Who are they fooling? They're talking about they keep it real when they talk about million dollars and driving around in fancy cars. Come on, I don't see real people driving around in rich fancy cars throwing cash around like it was nothing. I say Nas should of stayed REAL like his first album ""Illmatic"", because that's when he showed he had talent."
4,A review of Nas' album in comparison to his other works.,"""I AM"" is a solid album. For better or worse, ""Illmatic"" will always be the measuring stick for Nas simply because of what it did for hip-hop. It, along with albums like Wu-Tang's, Biggie's, and O.C.'s helped to bring the NY emcee back to a national stage. Also, the intricate rhyme patterns on songs like N.Y. State of Mind, Memory Lane, and Represent raised the stakes for all who would pick up a mic. Nevertheless, the new album seems to attempt to bring back the some of the skeptical fans from ""Illmatic"" while maintaining those gained by ""It Was Written,"" which was not bad itself (especially ""Take It In Blood""). ""I AM"" could easily be listened to without skipping a track, but my favorites are Small World, Favor for a Favor, Ghetto Prisoners, You Won't See Me, Dr. Knockboots, Life Is What You Make It, Nas is Like, Kissing, and Undying Love. It definitely meets my 7-jam quota."
4,Solid.,"A solid outing from Nas, this was his most 'pop' point in his career so I was a little 'Eh' about it. Nas is very gifted lyrically so even when he is not at top peak he is still better then most in the game."
3,"OK, nothing special--especially for Nas","Let me preface this by saying I'm a huge Nas fan. He's my favorite rapper, and I love hip hop. However, I think this and Nastradamus were definitely his low point in his career.The CD's not bad. By Nas' standards, it most definitely is, but compared to most other CD's it's just OK. Nas' lyrics are pretty good, not nearly good as Illmatic/It Was Written though. The production is alright, the only outstanding beat was on Nas Is Like, by DJ Premier.There are a couple bangers on here, but this was the first Nas CD I heard with any fillers. I disliked Dr Knockboot, Big Things, K-I-SS-I-N-G, and Money Is My Bitch quite a bit.My favorite tracks: 1. Nas Is Like 2. We Will Survive 3. Ghetto PrisonersAs I said, I'm a big Nas fan, but this definitely was one of his weaker outings."
5,A Dope ALBUM!,A Dope album by one of the dopest mc's in the rap game awesome lyrics and awesome flow
3,3.5 Stars,Not exactly illmatic or stillmatic but if you are a Nas fan like me you will get it a couple of standout songs but thats it but a solid cd
5,A life enriching work of stunning beauty.,"This was the first time I have ever read a book of poetry cover to cover in one sitting. The books gripping opening poem on the Civil War caught hold of me and I could not stop reading until I had travelled in the book several thousand miles and a few centuries later to Kyoto where a small gesture from a stranger brings this magical work to a stunning close. Relax, make yourself a cup of tea or coffee, and read this book. In a short while you will feel wonderfully enriched by the great spirits who inhabit these poems, the historical events that swirl through the pages, and the deep and elusive insights that suddenly snap into focus in odd places. Its one of those books that makes you want to buy all the other books an author has written. If his other works are half as good as this one I'll happily read them all."
5,Excellent practical approaches to common human crisies,"I used this book to supplement material in a graduate level Crisis Intervention class, and found it to be invaluable. There is a smattering of theory, but the bulk of the material focuses on understanding the human situation behind common crises such as suicide, loss, HIV, homelessness,victims of violence, health care crises, voiolent people, and life-change crises. Very practical and readily applicable, the text lends a firm backbone to anyone working in the crisis management field for the first time, and even for old timers who have never felt quite comfortable with suicide, etc. Takes the guesswork out of understanding the issues behind the problem, and empowers the worker. I highly recommend this book."
3,Visual Arts of Africa,"I didn't receive my book because they ran out of the product. I didn't see anything saying out of stock, maybe they should not advertise if they do not have any. But they were great at refunding the money back. Good service."
5,MONSTERS IN THE CLOSET stars Fergie of Black Eyed Peas,"Stacy Ferguson, also none a Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas, Kids incorporated star from 1983-1989, and former member of Wild Orchid, has a short role in this movie. Shes the lil blonde girl. Shes so cute in it lol. Its a must have for any fans of fergie. She was like 11 in it lol.Its a great movie and people should by it anyway. even if you rnot a fergie fan."
4,Stelllaaaa!!!...,"MONSTER IN THE CLOSET, as everyone has said, is a wonderful monster / sci-fi movie parody. The humor is well-placed, the creature is decently realized, and the characters are just nutty enough to not be stupid. As a 1950s-80s sci-fi maniac, I love all of the references and satire, especially the CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and THING elements! My favorite parts in the movie are John Carradine as the blind old guy, and Stella Stevens (whom I've loved ever since the original Nutty Professor) in the shower scene! Oh my! I watched that sequence several times in order to observe her tremendous acting technique. Whew! Anyway, I recommend MITC to any / all horror spoof addicts..."
4,so awesome.,"as far as b-movies go, this one is an instant classic. The monster alone is too funny. If you are a collector or enjoy cheesy horror/sci fi nonsense you should pick this one up. Not incredibly violent, but very ridiculous."
2,Where's Col. Sanders when you need him?,"Yet another homage to 50s sf/horror flicks. The movie predictably opens with a woman being eaten by the monster of the title (Kevin Peter Hall). No prizes for guessing where it's hiding. Being a PG movie there is no blood, just clothes being thrown out of the door. Strange considering this is a Troma production. But soon the monster, which resembles a man-sized chicken wing breaks out of the closet and as in all B movies wrecks havoc on the townspeople. Soon a biological technician and a small town obituary columnist(?!) are assigned to investigate the strange diappearance while the police, army and every man and his dog are called in to eradicate the chicken. This isn't one of Troma's best, or one of their ""Best Worst"" but you get to see Stella Stevens in the shower, so that's god enough for me to rate this 2 stars."
1,not a good movie,condition excellent but I overlooked the fact that its a troma film.....disappointed by this fact just looking for a more wholesome throwback scary movie
1,DVD is a copy of a VHS tape,"I enjoyed the movie, though it is cheesy. (You can read the other reviews for the movie plot details.) But I gave this a 1 star because the DVD is a copy of the VHS Tape. Even the FBI warning at the start says illegal to copy this ""TAPE"". The quality is not good, but still watchable. In addition, they put R rated material on a PG rated movie. And that material starts before you even get to the disc menu, plus the bonus material also has R rated material. More of an FYI if you plan on showing this movie to your family."
1,Monster In The Closet.,"Yes it's a spoof and I still don't care for it, it is mildly entertaining. worth a watch but I was bored."
2,terrible copy,This movie copy was not good. There is a line that runs through the picture and the picture is not clear. Unhappy as this is a good movie and one I hoped to watch more.
3,Chief,Based on two NYPD cops in the 70s known as Batman & robin the actors did a good job. Also by adding a sense of humour was great.
4,Nice trimmer,"I was a little worried when I ordered this trimmer. The price is a bit steep compared to some of the others on the market. Although it is not a bargain, the quality of the trim makes it worth the money.This is a nice unit that will work with a cord or without. The adjustment setting is straight forward and easy to set. The plastic guard pulls off for cleaning of the blades. There is some maintenance required -oiling the blade and brushing out the trimmings- but its not onerous. Overall a pretty nice deal."
3,Battery died out on me!,"The trimmer lasted for almost 2 years, before the battery died out!I did not use the trimmer frequently, once a week and re-charged after every use."
1,did not last,"Well I have enjoyed it for one year exactly. Today I was going to make tea, and picked it up to take to the sink, and the whole handle broke off. It was a blessing it did not have boiling water in it! It is not fixable."
1,Defective product,"Unfortunately the handle on this unit broke when I poured on its third use. If I could have found a replacement part, it could have been saved."
2,vac roll,"they work ok, but the deni 1761 did not ,so for $24.00 i sent it back and got a replacement vac. the cost to return it. i coulde have boought it at wal mart."
2,"Deni 8"" by 20' Replacement Rolls set of 2",I was not pleased with these rolls as they just didn't want to vacuum air out of the bag. I read and reread the directions more than I wanted to but couldn't get the air to vacuum out.
2,These are too thick and heavy!,These particular ones are very thick and we can't get the machine to vacuum them although the seal is good. We'll be looking for much thinner rolls in the future.
3,Magic Vac replacement rolls,"Although not cheap, these rolls work as intended. You can also boil in the bag product.Good strong bags. Also good for storing other than food items."
1,Not as pictured,"The ""one"" side spot is larger and doesn't match the spots on the other sides. Further, when they arrived the material was dingy and yellowed. Also came with a tag sewn into the seam that was difficult to remove without damaging them. I won't use them, and since the shipping and handling charges were close to the price of the product I probably won't bother returning them. Cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Fuzzy Dice,"These have not held up quite as well as I hoped. I have black ones and the sun has faded them in spots. Also one of the dots peeled off a ""six"" side."
1,"Drippy, soap opera tripe.","Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict-- Beyond a cash-in attempt on Sean Bean's fame, I can't summon any reason for A Woman's Guide to Adultery to come back to us. The storyline follows separate women and their unlucky and often painful pursuits of men who are either married or emotionally stunted. The Bean-centric story, which finds a particularly repugnant woman named Rose (Theresa Russell, Wild Things) stupidly falling for him (Paul) even though she knows he has a wife. She then proceeds to get vindictive, when he opts to end their affair and stick with his spouse, who happens to be pregnant. Paul comes off looking like a flaccid doormat and Rose, who sets off on a campaign to publicly humiliate him with nude photos, turns into a detestable she-demon. Frankly, I could care less if either of these tools find happiness.-Full review at dvdverdict.com"
2,Poor directing makes for bad acting!,"Unfortunately Mr. Hayman has taken a clever script and a handful of talented actors and combined them with chopping editing, unfeeling direction and a handful of bad actors. This had the potential to be a witty and entertaining film. Instead it turned out to be a real disappointment. It is my opinion that Ms. Russell should perhaps take up doing childrens' material. Children like over-acting."
3,Slightly disapppointing...,"I was a little bit disappointed when I first listened to this soundtrack.Yes, it does sound great, but every instrument is digitally replicated and not real even though it says orchestrations on the cover.Qualitywise, I'd say it's a little bit better than the music that you find on The Wind Waker's original soundtrack.I've also had some problems playing the CD of on my CD-player. It doesn't work. I have to play it on my computer to be able to listen to it, which is a shame. I don't know if all copies are like this though, I might have been unlucky...If you're know what you're buying and what to expect, this isn't too bad a soundtrack. I'd still recommend it to people who enjoyed Zelda: Majora's Mask and would like to have a different musical experience than the one you got in the game!"
4,Decent,"Even though this album is made wiht keyboards, they are very clear, full sounding. Most of the songs are decent, a few are a little annoying. I reccomend Astral Observatory, mainly because I loved that song in the game, and it sounds really good on this cd. Also the bounus Indigo-Go's track is a nice jazzy swing, that is amusing. Overall you can't really go wrong."
3,"Good, but not great.","I was really hoping this would have been as good as the Ocarina of Time orchestrated album. I was hoping this album would be orchestrated! It has the flavor of Major's mask. but its not all there. Take the Goron's Shrine piece for instance: In the game, the song is backed by the goron's voices giving it a truly amazing sound. In this cd however, those goron voices are synthesized and also in the wrong pitch. Not what I expected. One star gone right there. It just does not have the same feeling thatThe Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Original Soundtrackhas. Its still a nice piece, but it could have been better."
2,The movie cannot compare to Styron's short story,"I found this movie to be a very poor interpretation of William Styron's short story. The film was suprisingly flat and had little of the wonderful texture of the original text. The actors seemed rather forced as did much of the dialogue. I had expected much more, especially since William Styron's daughter was the director."
5,Movie,"Love this movie, recommended by a friend. Love the compassion and sense of family obligation. Love the landscape scenes and deep south culture."
3,Interesting storyline Worth the rental price.,A fun & nice movie about the south! Overdone on the language. If not for the language it would be a better family movie. I would have rated it higher if not for the excessive amount of language.
2,"Shadrach is good, but not that good.","Shadrach was a good movie. The characters really shone in this movie, especially Andie MacDowell. I can not say the same for Harvey Keitel. He was not right for this role. He was loud and seemed abusive. But, overall, all of the actors did put on a decent portrayal of this short story."
4,A small but charming pleasure,"There are so many good reviews of this film written already that I need add very little.The acting is superb, the atmosphere of the South excellently portrayed and the comedy and underlying drama beautifully unfolds.It brought some sun to a cold Welsh winter evening, for which I thank Harvey Keitel, Andie MacDowell and the remainder of the excellent cast. The direction is excellent and in total sympathy with the original short story written byWilliam Styron.This is an unpretentious film that makes you feel you have spent your time well when it comes to an end. Highly recommended. I am sure you will enjoy it."
4,"A beautiful story, simply told","I greatly enjoyed this film! The plot was very believable, and the way in which the story was told was simple, and down-to-earth. I noticed that some reviewers were offended by the language, which surprised me since I did not think it was at all extreme. When a film uses ""offensive"" language, but only to the extent that the characters would have realistically done, I feel the director/writer has been faithful to the telling of the story. The mother in this tale, and the elderly ex-slave are two very ""old-souls"" and beautiful people. I highly recommend this movie, and only gave it 4 stars because the plot had slightly greater potential and depth, but, perhaps this is complimentary, as the director chose to tell the story simply, without attempting to make it more complex or ""riveting""."
5,3 1/2 stars for the film and 5 stars for the DVD,a pleasant sincere story about the life of a poor white-american family during the Great Depression inter-crossed with the memories of a strange lonely black-american who returns to die in the place of his childhood when he was a slave in that family plantation... DVD quality is excelent looking at the facial detatails...as expected from columbia-tristar home video releases. real joy
3,YEA PRETTY GOOD,"Not a bad read...pretty good really. Reasonably thought proving in a moderate way. It might not be a bad idea to have a read of this book yourself. All in all, it's possible to do other things with your time rather than read this book but if you were to decide to read this book instead of doing the other things, then I can't see that the decsion would be a particularly bad one.It might be a good decision especially if after reading the book yu decide that you were glad you had read it. That would then have been a good choice decision, and I congratulate you for taking it.Well done."
4,Thoughtful and balanced,"UP is a very thoughtful and balanced attempt to approach a difficult subject. One of the best things about this book is the tacit acknowledgement that this really isn't an issue where one side is right and the other is wrong; both sides have very meritorious arguments. While I, too, tend to be ""agnostic"" on the subject (while leaning towards ""opposed""), UP presented several perspectives, for both sides, that I had not considered.A well written, insightful, and balanced book.Recommended."
4,Possibly the most impartial book on the subject,"Calling himself a ""death penalty agnostic,"" Turow takes a moderate position on the death penalty. It's a refreshing read inspired by Turow's participation in the post-moratorium, Illinois death penalty commission. Turow lays out an analysis of some very important considerations. While he never really takes a position, he examines the issues from all angles, from a very good discussion of victim rights to a very good discussion of alternate incapacitation of criminals. He candidly admits that this is a book based on his experiences and not necessarily on scholarly study. Overall, I would recommend the book to anyone interested in the topic, with the caveat that you don't limit your reading on the topic to this book.As far as Turow goes, I'm not even a big fan of his non-fiction work.Happy Reading"
4,Read for Day 1 of Law School,"Arizona State University assigned ""Ultimate Punishment"" to all of the first year law students to read before the first day of classes in August 2005. It's a good overview of the different issues currently surrounding capital punishment.The book didn't necessarily strengthen or weaken any of my views on the death penalty. But, it did provoke some thoughts and different perspectives from both sides of the issue.All-in-all, a good read for anybody wanting to learn about the issues surrounding the death penalty."
4,Adorable! Daughter LOVES it!,This Mystery Machine lunch box is absolutely adorable. My daughter said several kids even complimented her the first day she brought it to school. She's in 8th grade & some of the kids that liked it most were in high school. It is cool because it's shaped differently than traditional lunch boxes with just artwork on them. I would have appreciated it including a water bottle or something for this price though. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is small. It's a good thing my child doesn't eat a big lunch or it wouldn't hold everything. Seller was great. Shipped quickly & packing was perfect. Thanks!
2,Scooby Doo Lunch Box,"I bought this lunch box for my 5 year old nephew for his birthday, per his request for a Scooby Doo lunchbox and backpack. The reviews that I read weren't right. The lunch box only came as itself, without any attachments. The zipper sticks and it doesn't seem that good of a value for the money. As it was a gift, I gave it to my nephew cause I didn't have any other option, but if I had seen a review like this I would have ordered another one and saved myself the hastle."
4,Scooby Doo Mystery Lunch Kit,This lunch kit is very nice. It is extremely sturdy. I like the insulated material as it is easy to clean. The one thing you may want to know it is large and it zips on the end. The delivery process was very quick and there were not any problems.
2,"It is not a lunch kit, it is a simple lunch bag","I love Scooby Doo and so does my 4 year old. I read the reviews on this specific item and the reviews mention strap for a water bottle, a coin pocket for money, and containers that do NOT come with this kit. I am very disappointed and want others to know that if you order this, it is ONLY a lunch bag not a KIT! The bag is well made and the details are great but please be aware."
4,Fun and it's held up...,"My 6 year old is rough on his things and this Scooby-Doo lunch bag has withheld his tough love for the school year. It's now nearing the end of the year and the zipper on the back flap is getting more and more difficult to open but it has been easy to clean when food or drinks explode inside. It's labeled ""Lunch Kit"" but there is no ""kit"", it's just the thermos style bag. I would recommend this for those seeking an reusable lunch bag/box for the roughest of kids."
4,strong lunch box.. already on 3rd year,our son loves Scooby Doo and was so excited to get this.. and has taken pretty good care of it. It has a couple tears on the inside that happened about the middle of the second year of use.. we taped it (with clear packaging tape)and it still has many more uses in it!
4,This lunch kit is sure to please,"My 5 year old is ready for kindergarten with his new Mystery Machine lunch kit. Our kit does include the sandwich container which is designed apparently for Smucker's Uncrustable's. I like the coin container on the front of the van - perfect for milk money, although there is a water bottle included. The water bottle won't roll around as there is a velcro strap to keep it in place. The lunch box opens at the roof with 2 zippers across the top and an additional velcro fasten to secure it. While this lunch kit was a bit pricier than others, I found it to be unique and it certainly put a big smile on my Scooby fan's face!"
2,kind of a rip-off,for $27 i thought it would at least come with SOME accessory - but nothing it is an empty box. No money holder don't know what the other folks below are talking about. and no thermos/drink holder. pretty much worth $12 so i call it a rip-off.
1,What is pictured is not what I received,"I ordered this lunch box off the image shown. In the second image you can clearly see that there is a flap that folds down. There are two of these boxes out there, one with the flap and one without. It is the one WITH the flap that I wanted, so I tripple checked the image to be sure it was the right one.The lunch box arrived over the weekend and it is the wrong one.I do have an email into the company to see what can be done and will ammend this review if the situation is corrected."
1,Missing items,"Not only did our $25 dollar lunch kit not come with a water bottle the design have apparently been changed so it now has no strap, and no pocket for money. Big surprise it's made in Unpronouncable City, China.The best part is I noticed the missing items AFTER giving it to my 4 year old daughter so I guess we are stuck with it.If this is the road thermos products are taking I will not be purchasing any more products from them.Ironically I found this item while browsing their website after watching a ""How it's Made "" show about their vacuum thermos and thought I would check out what looked to be a quality first world manufactured product."
2,Not kid friendly.,My 5 year old son loved it until he tried to unzip it. Doesn't unzip around the curve. You have to really pulpit apart and yank it to get it open. Can't open and close it.
1,Disappointment abounding,Bought lunchbox set and when it arrived it came without little red snack pack. Sent it back after GREAT DIFFICULTY figuring out how to do so (getting a #&^&^*&^$** phone number was impossible). Another was sent... also without little red snack pack! WHAT THE HECK. Great difficulty finding number again. Got through only to find out set does not come with little red snack pack. Get it together over there!!!
2,Scooby doo lunch kit,"I am unable to decide what the lunch kit means. I only received the box part. Even though I know that my son will love it, as a consumer I am very disappointed with the lack of details surrounding the product. I have learned my lesson."
5,My preschooler LOVES this lunch box,"My 4 year old loves Scooby Doo, so when I saw this on the WB shop site, I had to get it. It stands 7 1/2"" tall, 10"" wide and 4 1/2"" deep. It's very well insulated and is super cute. He is a hit at the breakfast table at preschool! If this one got lost I would immediately go out and purchase another. Great Buy!"
4,Sonia Nieto cuts to the core of multicultural issues,"Affirming Diversity is an excellent text book for anyone involved in the field of education. This book is also a good read for parents. It reads fairly easily, and uses case studies to give insight to lessons. The case studies bring light to the experience of being a minority in a dominated culture. The book is written with sensativity and intelligent. Sonia Nieto is not afraid to write about the struggle, frustration and pain that minorities experience."
3,Sociopolitical?,"I found this book to primarily address the issues of eastern seaboard minority students rather than the issues faced in the southwestern US. Here in AZ there is a very strong prejudice against Immigrant students of Spanish speaking origin. Did you realize that in most workplaces in AZ we are not allowed to speak in a language other than English to a co-worker? Some paranoid person, usually a transplanted Anglo from out of state thinks we are talking about them. Ms Nieto needs to make her text more of a national treasure by not just focusing on those in the Midwest and Eastern seaboard nothern states. This book is due for an update!"
1,No Story here at all,I found this book very boring and it took me a real long time to finish it. The character are not strong enough to hold interest and there really wasn't any story at all. I cannot recommend this book to anyone.
1,Really bad.,I can't believe I spent $13 on this book. It reads like the rough draft of a novel--not an actual novel. It's banal. The heroine is nursing her baby and her breasts are sore! Wow! What an insight! Phillips' brain must have been on auto-pilot when she wrote this. It got decent reviews in the media when it came out in hardcover. Why??
1,Dissapointed,"I'm officially done with Jayne Anne Phillips. Having read Lark and Termite and now MotherKind I know for certain that she is definitely not my type. I found the novel extremely boring. You all enjoy if you want, maybe this book is for you, but you'll have to judge yourselves. It is definitely not my kind of book."
1,A great disappointment,"Anytime a Jayne Anne Phillips book comes out, the temptation is to compare it to her great story collections Black Tickets and Fast Lanes. But Motherkind fails on its own terms, with bland characters and even blander, flabbier scene setting. It's hard to care about a narrator so self-obsessed. Just as a friend's pregnancy is more interesting to her, the narrator seems to think we'll be fascinated by her endless litany of childbearing/childrearing, most of which is old hat. An earlier Phillips would have undercut this sentimentality with vicious irony (without lessening the characters), but here she piles on even more. Her last novel Shelter was overdone too. Maybe it's time to pare down and go back to short fiction."
3,Good characters but...,"As a nearly 300 page character study (or relationship study or exercise in putting many beautiful sentences together) this book is first rate. Phillips is clearly a gifted writer. But...I kept waiting for something to happen. Since we know on page 1 that Katherine is dying that no longer counts as the crisis that keeps a good story moving. Perhaps this book should be looked upon as a slice of life--often beautiful, sometimes strikingly mundane--but not the stuff of the engrossing novel I was hoping it might be."
2,And the point is.........,"This book had great potential, but no point. There were so many loose ends. I guess that's like life, but it doesn't make for good reading. Ugh. Painful."
2,did I actually read it all?,"This book seemed like a glimpse of someone's hectic everyday life. I am amazed I finished it. I enjoyed the author's writing style (some great imagery and thought connections) but the story never amounted to anything. The characters seemed like aquaintences-I knew some details of their lives but I never really cared about them or about getting to know them. The relationships of the main character (her name escapes me) were of interest at first, but again never amount to much. Her relationships with women were strong, her relationship with her husband, disconcerting. The book felt like it was building to something but it never peaked. Can I assume this is the author's comment on life?If I were to turn back time, I wouldn't read this book but would pick up another by this author. I will consider reading other work of hers in the future."
5,When will the INFUZE be available again!!!,"This coffeemaker makes the best coffee I've ever made at home. And it's entertaining! What a combo. So, why can't I buy it? Another example of capitalism gone awry!"
1,Another lemon.,"I returned the previous unit because the coffee was not hot enough--only 180 degrees. The new unit (which arrived very promptly) only heated the coffee to 175 degrees. Also, the on-off switch was defective, since it did not toggle cleanly between ""on"" and ""off"" and the indicator light did not turn on when it was brewing. I was (somewhat) willing to try a third time, but customer service tells me the problems with this model are widespread."
5,A Cafinated Christmas,"I gave this pot to my husband for Christmas and it's great. My coffee pours into my mug at 190 degrees (it would probably be hotter if I lived at sea level, but I'm up in the mountains where water boils at a lower temperature) and tastes like I'm in a coffee house. It's even easy to clean. I love it (and so does my husband) and I'd recommend it to anyone (I'm planning on giving it to my dad for his birthday). It really is everything that ""Cook's Illistrated"" promissed."
5,Fantastic coffee - picked up on clearance - great surprise!,"I have been looking for a way to replicate the taste and temperature of the superb coffee made by the coffee houses for a long time. I was in a SAAN store in a small town in Alberta over Christmas and noticed that these machines were on for $39.99. Not being familiar with them, I was curious, but didn't pick one up. Just this morning, I decided to see if the SAAN near me had any - I bought the last one on the shelf. Apparently the inventory that they received sold quickly. I am now sipping a tasty, hot, smooth cup of coffee almost identical to one that comes in a paper cup for over $2. And I have learned that this machine is discontinued. What a find. Highly recommended."
1,Still hoping.,"I ordered this coffee maker after reading the Cook's Illustrated review. I had been dissatisfied with drip coffee makers because they did not heat the coffee hot enough, and Cook's Illustrated said this machine heated the coffee to 203 degrees. I used the machine twice, and the coffee was barely 180 degrees, which is not hot enough to extract the full flavor from the beans. I also though the coffee was not as strong as I would prefer, although I didn't use it enough to experiment with various amounts of ground coffee. I sent it back for a replacement.By the way, the previous reviewer apparently had a defective unit. There was no need to twist the pot on the base to engage the electrical connection. I do agree with the reviewers who said that it is easy to make a mess with the grounds when taking the unit apart for cleaning."
2,Too hot.,I had high hopes for this coffee maker. The coffee is flavorful and smooth but way too hot. I only have one mug (about 2 cups) every morning and I thought the warmer plate was overheating the coffee. But when I doubled the amount the coffee was still WAY TOO HOT. (I think the brewer heats the coffee to almost boiling.) I have to put a spoon in my mug for five minutes before I can drink it.I am going to see if Amazon can refund my money on this one.
5,Im confused.,"(...) Her off key, beautiful style is what makes her N'Dambi. You really think D'Angelo, Badu, & Bilal would work with her if she couldn't hold a tune? She doesn't sound like any artist you'll find in the industry right now and that's what makes her. Hey I love the CD...... I didn't get the first because it was too hard to find, but this one was worth my (money)."
4,Still the Best CD I have Bought in Awhile Yet,I wish she would just sing w/o the gimmicky scats. The album is great nonetheless.
4,Pro Fresh,This stuff really works. Tastes like Clorox. Kills every germ in your mouth for DAYS!! Let's hope it has no negative side effects.
3,Less than Expected,"This may work on your breath if you can handle the taste. It smells like bleach and I would also assume that's what bleach tastes like as well. The taste was so bad I couldn't use it again. I will have to try another product. So, if you don't want a bleach tasting product in your mouth make another choice."
2,profresh,"profesh took about 5days before it started to work on my breath, then it only worked on my breath for about a good 5days after that it didnt work anymore. im going to try it again because it did work for those five days...."
3,Not very effective,"This product did not work at all. I suspect its unhealthy for people who do not want to ingest chlorine on a daily basis. Additionally, it had no impact on the quality of my breath. Therabreath is a much better product. Dr. Katz's probiotic kit seems to be working. The one advantage to this chlorine kit is that it features one of the best tongue scrapers you can find."
1,Bad product bad taste,"The first bottle work like magic, after that when you buy a larger quantity, the quality is not the same it suck. I switched to BreathRx and I'm in love with it."
1,Fairly Wack!,"finally got to see this Film&Was Bored Beyond belief.nobody seemed to have any Real Chemistry.this Film Wanted to Be a Hip-Hop ""When Harry Met Sally"" but never Connects at all with me.Mos Def was about the Only Believeable Personality in the Film."
2,decent,I ordered this movie for a friend as a gift but the product arrived on time and undamaged so I assume it was good!
4,so good,this dvd should be made into blu ray asap! its a really good story and the actors are superb to say the least
3,Too Predicable,"I know how this film was going to unfold in the first ten minutes..The performances by Mos Def and Queen Latifa are good but the rest of the cast ""sleep-walks"" through this one. It's not a film I would think about seeing more than once..."
2,not what you think it is..,"all this hype about being about hip-hop...yeah right...this is from the same mold as the best man, the brothers and every other black film out there. come on people, bring some orignality to the screen, intrigue our minds, bring something new the table. this is so cliche' don't get this movie....i would give it one star if i didn't like the actors in it."
3,"Sanaa, Sanaa, Sanaa","Every time I see her she is pining for someone. First it was Wesley in Disappearing Acts (an HBO movie), then Omar Epps in Love and Basketball, and now Taye Diggs in this one. May I add, she was pining for Taye in the Best Man, too, and this movie is nothing but Love and Basketball part 2, only Sanaa's character's name is Sidney, the ball has been replaced with hip-hop, and Omar replaced by Taye, spiced with a little Nicole Ari Parker, Boris Kodjoe, and Her Highness Queen Latifah. Sanaa, you need a new agent, and get yourself some new scripts. Or at least a new, fresh leading man. The movie is entertaining enough, but no originality, used storyline, and Taye is not convincing in his love for hip-hop. You can tell his ""flava"" is about as rehearsed as the script. The soundtrack KICKS ASSSSS though!"
2,Nice Try...,"This movie could have been great but it turned out to be yet another failed attempt. There was little to no character development in this transparent script, ""friends in love, friends don't know they are in love, friends in love"".Also, this film is another production that paints the only way for young Black Americans to be successful is to be involved in the entertainment industry, i.e. rapper, music producer, or professional athlete. Also this movie leads you to believe that all young Black Americans are wrapped up in the hip hop culture that we spontaneously burst into classic raps songs.Overall this movie had all the right ingredients yet was put together poorly. Nice try..."
3,Fun movie with good actors,"I enjoyed this movie but not for the reasons most people have cited. The hip-hop theme was ok and it portrayed black people the way I know black people to be and not the way they are usually portrayed in gangsta movies and the like.However the main reason I enjoyed it is because of the beautiful people and I mean the sight of Boris Kodjoe is enough to send any woman drooling. Especially the night of their date when Sanaa says ""Let's have s*x now"" and he goes, ""yes, lets"" just like that.And Taye. He's gorgeous. I still remember him in the bathtub at the beginning of ""The Best Man"". I couldn't concentrate for about half an hour after that.Mos Def is a great actor. He's so smooove and I love his cheeky smile. He's the kind of guy I would like to know as a person.Okay so apart from the above nothing else about the movie really excited me. Its worth watching though."
3,Cute but not great,The best thing about this movie was Mos Def. The man has acting skillz and should explore them immediately. The rest of the movie was a big disspointment to me. This has nothing on the movie The Best Man. This one is pretty lame...although the soundtrack is pretty cool.
5,I love this movie,Customer service was excellent and everything happened as described. I will be buying more of my movie favorites right here.
1,Complete Disappointment,I wad so excited to get this movie. But when I put it in my Sony DVD player it wouldn't play at first I thought it was my player but on the tv screen it said not compatible with product. It this DVD works in another. Country. I wish that that was specific I woulndt have wasted my money. So pissed and disappointment.
2,"Hello, anyone ever heard of being ""original?""","This movie was beautiful to look at -- with no volume. I love hip hop but this movie went into overkill. The entire plot was predictable. Give me a break, here we go again.And Latifah. Great actress. But she has her own sexual-political agenda, psssst, if y'know what I mean.Another yawn of a Black movie"
4,I liked it.,"I liked this movie. Mainly because of Boris Kodjoe. To me, he stole the show from Taye Diggs. But it was still one of kind. Oh not to forget, my boy Mos Def is in it. Doing an outstanding job. One for the archives.theartistdyc*"
4,Keeping It Real!,I like the movie as far as the relationship of Dre and Sidney. I liked how they based their relationship of friendship aroundHip-Hop! They kept it real as far as that goes as well as unique. The acting was on point. The movie also reminded me of my past relationship with my Ex-boyfriend. So I naturally had a instant connection with Brown Sugar the first day I saw it in the theater. So I definitely recommend this movie. It's a good one to add to a video collection!
1,i could point you elsewhere,"A predictable romanceA light satire on commercial hip-hop with an implausibley successful rap duo who are painfully unfunny.Successful African-American characters are mostly uninteresting, one-dimensional, except for Taye Diggs' character, who is the conflicted manager of a pop-rap record company that embraces commercial value over keepin' it real artists."
4,very good movie,"I am probably da biggest sanaa lathan fan. Its a shame dat she she is so underrated. This movie shows just how much young black actresses are not being potrayed in the spotlight as much as the males are. The movie is basically about a man and woman , frenz since childhood, who are leading their own lives, but the test of friendship unites them.From ythis movie u'll c love, gain laughter, and its definately worth seeing. Overall its a very good movie, but the front cover does make it predictable which is a shame.But i don;t feel this movie is as good as love and basketball which is y it didn't get 5 stars!! Its great for a date movie or chillin wid frenzand taye diggs makes it even more worthit, [...] da brudda is fine!!Shout out to sanna , ur too much!!"
2,2.5 stars,"Alright. So I had intended to see this movie upon its release way back and just really never got to it. A week or so ago it was playing on Oprah's Oxygen network and I was very happy that I would finally be able to see it. Overall, it was alright. So then it was on again the next day and I couldn't stomach watching it again.It may be called Brown Sugar, but the plot moves slower than molasses. It is way too predictable and sweet, with very little substance. It wasn't even all too interseting the first time around and I couldn't stand seeing it a second time. There's a reason why these movies are on TV, people. No need to purchase the DVD. As soon as I saw it once, I had gotten my dose and wanted no more."
2,UGH!,"Mos Def, I can not deal..................directors, producers don't do ""Him"" again! I can't stand his character or his acting!!!!!!!!!! Taye Diggs and Sanaa Lathan, are such a visual cliche' they have been in like 3 movies opposite of each other, ok! There are other actors and actresses out there. But nevertheless they did an awesome job! Nicole Ari Parker, plays a great Villan always! Is she really a Bitch or something?"
5,Raid training at its very best,Raids and CQB are used by us as training manuals and text books. It is the best all round book on the subject of high risk warrant service and the related training. The author has obviously had extensive experience in this aspect of tactical law enforcement. The diagrams and checklists are invaluable. Well done......looking forward to the next one.
4,Raids!,"Well, this is a good book on how to conduct a ""Raid"". All you need to know from planning to execution, entry tactics and more. I think this is a good book for police officers (especially for the planning section).If you never have done this kind of work it could sometimes be hard too understand everything , but Mr Londsdale also write in the foreward that he will not explain everything. But if you buy this book togheter with ""Advanced weapons training for HRT"" you got most of it covered. I recommend these 2 books. I also recommend ""Tactical Advantage"" by Gabriel Suarez."
4,Raid,Gives details and sketches for you to follow along with what each person is suppose to do. Its like a training manual for swat teams.
5,"After Years of Looking, A True Manual for Serious Readers","Having waded thru and wasted valuable department funds on some of the more laughable works in this area, I would say this book is just about perfect, everything for serious students of high risked entry. Tactics,Training, Planning, and advice on Weapon Selection. The diagrams are wonderfully detailed the only thing one would ask for is maybe a little bit more on tactics but this just this reviewer being a little greedy. Thank You Mark Lonsdale for finally seriously addressing this subject."
3,What's with the photos?,"Only one negative issue with the book: ""There is a 50+ year old man on the cover"". This presumably is Mr. Lonsdale. Respectfully, SWAT is a young man's game, and he looks like someone who is trying to re-live times gone by. Same goes with many of the photos in the book. In fact, many photos look 20 years old. Send someone out to any Narc unit for a day or two and get some updated photos."
4,Safety 1st,Son just got his license and his first car..perfect for first set and helps this Mom relax ....three more words
3,Good for small trunks,"I bought this because I needed a small bag to keep a few tools and first aid items in small car. Bag was a little smaller than what I thought it would be and items in it such as help sign, poncho were of very cheap material. In a sense, you are paying for the bag and the jumper cables. I do like that the bag has small velcro strips on bottom that keep it in place in the trunk. That is a plus. Overall, it serves the purpose for what I bought it for."
4,Not quite what I expected but it will do,"The bag that came was much smaller than I thought it would be. However, it came with the basics that I need for an upcoming road trip, It is small and compact which is nice. I guess in my mind I was just picturing something larger, with a little more heavy duty jumper cables. The help sign is just a piece of plastic comparable to think plastic wrap. But it will do."
4,Good enough for basic needs,"For the price, it is a very good value. There is velcro on the bottom of the bag, so it mounts easily to the side of your trunk. The first aid kit is just some band aids and antiseptic pads, so you will probably want to add some more first aid supplies."
3,Value,Product is OK. You get what you pay for. This is your basic starter roadside kit. Nothing major. Bag is nice..
1,Not looking for a toy?!,I ordered this product as a gift for my brother for Christmas. It was a joke! The sign looked like someone hand made it. The doctor's bag was the size of a small child's toy doctor's bag. Not what I expected at all. I gave it as a gag gift to someone else instead.
3,So so,You get what you pay for with this product. To be truthful I should've spent a little more and got something better
3,Not bad,"The best thing about this kit is the bag... seriously. Everything in it is cheap, but just because it's cheap doesn't mean it won't help you out in a pinch. First aid kit is just wipes and band-aids. I wouldn't try to jump a v8 engine with the cables, but for the trunk of a little 4cyl car this will add a little piece of mind. There are no batteries for the flashlight included. Just add some."
5,"easy to use, fun to watch","This product is making my life much easier. powerful and so easy to use. it does not mess up with the label as some of the products do. I am very happy with the desicion of buying the product. it has bottle opener and knife sharpener, not very useful though."
4,works well-good price,"This can opener works well, is quieter than previous can openers I have owned. I haven't used the knife sharpener so I can't rate that aspect. It looks good. Worth the price."
4,"Amazing, incredible & perfect","No wonder it's amazing, it's being sold by amazon !!! This product was very helpful, the way it looks like is incredible, and it is very useful, all the people who visited me found it perfect, so just imagine how this would change your life"
3,"A Few Geographical Mistakes, But Otherwise Good","Frank and Joe are vacationing in Vermont when a teenager from a local camp goes missing. It is believed that the boy was kidnapped by members of a mysterious cult that lives nearby; however, the Hardys aren't so sure. Their investigation leads them to the remote timberlands of New Brunswick in Canada where they come face-to-face with a mad scientist who calls himself the Devil. This was a fairly good book. The story is interesting and is well-paced. The author obviously put some thought into the plot and setting; however, he still made some minor geographical mistakes (for example, it is Saint John, New Brunswick, not St. John). I must admit though that I'm tired of seeing that every time the Hardy's go to Canada, EVERY Canadian that they meet is French. Despite my complaining, I did enjoy the book and I feel that most fans of the series would as well."
5,Keychain for my new car,"I was looking for something substantial and sturdy. It is not too big, easily found in my purse and is well made. I expect to have it for a long time. Incidentally, if you were born in the year of the horse, you'll love this, too."
2,Not what they used to be,"My Dad has an old 1964 publishing of this Bible. It is beautiful, so I thought I'll get one. Boy was I surprised by the difference. The new bibles are of poor quality the paper is not even close to the old. The binding is far less than it used to be. The content is about the same, I really like the chain reference system, any thing you want you can find. So my recommendation for this Bible is it just is not worth the price they have set, back in the 60's it was , but now the workmanship is terrible. I would not buy this Bible, I have in fact sent mine back and am waiting on a refund of the excessive money I spent on it."
5,Fantasic Bible,"I bought this Bible in large print as a gift for my mother she's having difficulty reading smaller prints of late. She absolutely loves the print size of this bible! The leather is positively quality, the price is unbeatable and I did my research. We both own reference bibles from other publishers and the the Thompson Chain is in a class of it's own, I definitively recommend the Thompson Chain Reference Bible in large print for any studious learner ."
5,Step back! Give her air!,"This does just that. Gives you clean air using artificial and carbon filter components which fits the air cleaner perfectly. Expensive, but worth it. The carbon filters odors, the other parts of the filter trap the many sorts of particles which are floating around inside your home or workspace. Wait until you see what junk it has kept you from breathing in. Lasts a long time. Clean the washable filter regularly. Recommended."
4,Tulip Tree,"Long ago I had bought the book Isaak Denesen's African Cook had written. When I took a daughter to see the movie ""Out of Africa"", I fell in love with it. So when I saw this book on Amazon, I bought it. Sure enough it was better than the movie!It seems she and Finch-Hatten were together much longer than it seemed in the movie-17 years!Wonderful details and pictures!I looked up her home on Google Earth, and her home is now a museum and there are many pictures there to see."
5,A quote from the KENYA ROUGH GUIDE,"""Diligently researched and thoughtfully written account of Karen Blixen's years in Kenya that brings a complex personality to life."""
5,Perhaps the finest book written about Karen Blixen,"I loved this book and will keep my copy of it alongside my collection of Isak Dinesen's work because I know that I shall refer to it frequently. Dr. Donelson has such a beautiful and completely civilized way of seeing all facets of this complicated woman that I knew from the first page that the book would not startle or distress me with a common, contemporary take on Blixen's life. Extraordinary women like this must be gently, sympathetically revealed, not disrobed or exposed, as they have so much to teach us. It is always a blessing to see fine writing, too, and Dr. Donelson has an especially satisfying style. I recommend this book to all of Karen Blixen's readers today and in generations hence."
4,Linda did it good but Judith did it better,I am a huge fan of isak dinesen's work and love to read about her but after i read this i felt like i had just read judith thurman's book except her book was published a few years before i think that judith thurman's drive is what made her book get the national book award and she is a very good author it took judith 8 years to finised her book and she learned danish Linda's book seemed like a rehash that was to easy.
3,For fans of Karen,"For anyone with an interest in the life of Dinesen (Karen Blixen), this is a good addition to the library--unless you have read all of Dinesen's letters and books, because this is, verily, a compilation of writings already published--albeit a good compilation. The excerpts from Dinesen's writing can be irksome, however, when the author supposes they are thinly-veiled accounts of her true life. Some of these suppositions require a real leap of faith--especially because, most times, the gender must be transposed for Donelson's theory to hold water.I did not find that the medical notes were the focus of, or detracted from, the book as a whole.I have to ask: why is this book so doggone expensive? It's good, but not worth $35.00, given the fact that nothing new is brought to light."
1,Not a book of The Way,"I'm sure that the author had the best intentions, but this work comes across as a collection of clever psudo-wisdom that would be more at home in fortune cookies.It is not completly without merit, but if you are expecting a book on the level of the ""Tao Te Ching"" or ""The Zen Teachings of Bodhidharma"" or even ""The Tao of Pooh"" you should look elsewhere."
4,"""I feel a definite chill about me shoulders...""","A marvelous psuedo-historical! One of Eric Saward's best scripts. Michael Robbins as Richard Mace shines with Davison, making a delightful pairing. Even the rest of the TARDIS crew have their part to play. The setting, the location, and even studio bound sets all help this one rise above. It's just a shame that Saward didn't give names to the Terileptils. Even the android(with cricket gloves that didn't bother me) comes across pretty good. A typical lyrical Davison story puncuated by a straightforward script and great timing by all involved."
5,Two great stories!,"With this double tape set, viewers are treated to two stories with similar themes. Both are historical in context and both deal with monsters, of a sort. In The Visitation, the Doctor must stop the evil Terrileptals from overrunning a 17th century earth with a massive plague that would wipe out the entire population. In Black Orchid, we are treated to the first purely historical story since te days of Patrick Troughton's Doctor. Here, the Doctor discovers murder in the home of the Cranleighs. What dark secret is Lady Cranleigh trying to hide and how does it relate to Nyssa? Both stories are well paced, well acted stories, worthy of being included in anyone's video collection."
4,Interesting,"In ""The Visitation"" the Doctor goes to the time of the plagues, middle ages Europe. He meets a highwayman (robber) who is quite classy for a robber. The problem is that a small group of alien creatures crash landed on the earth and now they are trying to take over the earth. I wouldn't say it's an outstanding show but it's interesting.""Black Orchid"" is also interesting. This time the year is about 1920 or something in England. The Doctor gets mistaken for another Doctor and gets invited to a large house with classy people. He plays cricket there. The problem is that someone gets murdered and the Doctor gets accused. I like it."
4,"Werid, however interesting",This episode is needed for the 'New' Dr. Who series where they play off of it. Just watch it carefully and you will learn a lot about a future doctor.
4,Great alien invasion tale(except for the whining alien),"This picturesque tale takes place in the 1700's England(or surrounding countryside. It is better than a lot of the Peter Davison stories except for the Aliens themselves which are a whimpering bunch of loosers. Surely a more formidable foe could've been presented. The scarred faced fish guy wasn't as feirce as some of the mad peasants and Earthling natives. I kind of liked the bard with his silly one liners and dual pistols(which never fired). The story was good, but I think the Pescatons(see radio drama) would've made a better foe than these whining(fishy whatevers). The very gothic Black Orcid was not included but should have been. It was unique in that it relied totally on circa 1925 to tell the story instead of aliens or some such. I doubt a story as small as Black Oricd would be available on DVD except in additon to Visitation, which it is, in fact, not."
3,The sonic screwdriver bites the bullet!,"This double pack video of Doctor who from the early eighties has the 4 part ""Visitation"" and the 2 part ""Black Orchid."" ""The Visitation"" is quite a straight forward story of the aliens trying to wipe out humans on Earth using the plague. It tries to fit in historically with the 17th century events to explain away the Great Fire of London etc which is does reasonably well (back to the old Hartnell days). The character of Richard Mace really makes it though, he's a joy to watch and clearly loving the role.""Black Orchid"" however is a waste of space designed to show Peter Davison playing cricket (woo hoo) and general bimbling around in a period drama-bbc-style setting. More of a murder mystery than anything decent. Buy Earthshock instead and watch Adric die! Now that's fun!"
1,Not a very original idea; even the title is a repeat.,"I was very disappointed when I heard that the writer of the book had never even been to the Alamo! The book is put together in a haphazard way and does not offer any new insights.The publishing company seems to have jumped on the bandwagon to have a book about this famous place on its listings. The focus of the book is not really about the Alamo, but about people and places that do not directly relate to the place or San Antonio. True students of history will appreciate and recognize a well-organized work that is put together with the true meaning of history at the forefront."
1,Total Waste of Time,"A year earlier than the release of this Illustrated history The Alamo: An Illustrated History by George Nelson was released a excellent book full of images, information and original artwork, unlike this awful illustrated history in which I can find nothing original, new or even mildly interesting. This might catch an elementary school students attention if they had not been exposed to any Alamo history previously, and I wouldn't guarantee that, in otherwords skip this book go straight to George Nelsons originally titled and excellent book and spend your dollars on a book thats worthwhile"
5,WILBUR SMITHS #1 FAN!!,"I HAVE EVERY SINGLE BOOK HE HAS WRITTEN STARTING WITH ""WHEN LIONS FEED"" AND I'VE BEEN HOOKED SINCE. WE MOVED TO SO. AFRICA '79-'80 TO WORK ON SASOL PROJECT AND WHILE TRAVELING SAW MANY OF THE PLACES IN WHICH HIS STORIES TAKE PLACE, IT WAS JUST LIKE I'D BEEN THERE BEFORE.THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF A SINGLE BOOK IT'S A REVIEW OF ALL HIS BOOKS THEY ARE A MUST READ, BE SURE TO GET THEM IN SEQUENCE AS HE HAS WRITTEN 4 TRILIGES AND BE PREPARED TO STAY UP TO ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CAN NOT PUT HIS BOOKS DOWN."
3,It is a good book but something is missing,"In this book you can see how a woman can hate a man and the man can still love that woman, but the hate of these persons is because he kills her adoptive mother, but in book never say why he killed her, all the book is rolling in that hating all the time, and you don't know why he did that, you hate him and maybe he killed her in self defense. The rest of the story is full of action and courage of all the protagonists."
3,3 Stars for the shoddy replacement packaging,"Hey everyone, I really need to vent here. Today I received my replacement packaging in the mail for my homer head. All I can say is that i think I will stick with the head! Well, actually you HAVE to stick with the head. Almost like a sick joke. The new packaging is just a cardboard slip cover to hide the head! And here I went and paid 2.95 or whatever it was to get this crap.I sure hope the ""alternative"" packaging on the new box set(season 7) due out in about 2 weeks will actually be something more than the marge head with a cardboard slip cover over it."
3,"Bad Packaging, No Alternative, Great Season","Just arrived yesterday. I opened it expecting to find a coupon telling me how I can get the box case instead of the annoying and useless novelty case. No coupon so I looked around the web and found an image of it. It had a number to call, I called and the number has been disconnected. A little more searching and I found out that the number referred you to a website. I went there and there was nothing about getting a replacement box. Apparently, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has decided, despite numerous complaints, to only package this great season in a flimsy, cheap, plastic, ugly head (no offense, Homer).Other than that, this season has some classic episodes, including Itchy and Scratchy Land which could be a candidate for one of the best episodes from any season."
3,Why?,"Like most of you I don't understand Fox's thoughts behind this packaging. It's not a question of lining up DVDs on a shelf, it's about paying around $40 for a DVD set that is packaged so poorly. I can't imagine that they did this to save money. For those of you who bought the Sixth Season you know there is a note in the package to send away for a more substaintial box (www.simpsonsbox.com)like the previous 5 seasons were packaged. Naturally they want you to pay the shipping. So what was the point of the flimsy head box in the first place? Is this suppose to be funny? If they want to make their fans happy, for the love of god release the seasons faster! Other shows such as Futurama, Friends and the X-Files do not seems to have a problem. And as many other fans mentioned releasing 3 and 4 episode DVDs like Simpsons X-mas and X-mas 2, Gone Wild, Bart Wars, etc. does not help. Generally 2 of the 4 episodes on the disc were already released season set!"
5,Simpsons in its prime,"What a great season! It features classic episodes such as the stone cutters, the greyhound one where Mr. Burns sings ""See my Vest"", and Who Shot Mr. Burns? The Simpsons re-runs are not on as often as they used to be, so I have not seen many of these episodes in a long time. I forgot how funny they were and how much I loved them. The seasons from the mid to late 90's are what made the Simpsons the icons they are!"
3,simpsons season 6,"I love the Simpsons. This is the best show ever. This is truly a great season. However, I do hate the packaging. Nothing is holding it together and everything falls out when you open it. I have no idea why they decided to change the packaging. To make matters worse, you have to order a regular box by calling a phone number which redirects you to a website while being continually insulted for not liking the box they chose which is a cheap plastic container. I think it's ridiculous that when you call the phone number and visit the website they insult you (comically to them) for not liking their stupid packaging. Yes, I do happen to want my tv shows to stand upright when I put them on a shelf and I do keep my dvds organized. I deducted 2 stars for the hassle of going through all that to get what I want. They should have just sold both versions."
2,Awful packaging,"The moulded plastic which forms Homer's head is very cheap, thin and brittle. What a dumb idea to break the symmetry of the first five sets, especially for such a poorly executed gimmick.If I hadn't already purchased, I would wait a few months until Fox starts shipping standard packaging. It's bound to happen."
1,Rip-OFF,The previous version of this set had ONLY the Homer head box which is extremely annoing. Now they came up with the normal box and we have to pay for it again. It was cheaper than the rest but Amazon.com just doubled the price. What a rip-off this is.
1,Just have to buy it twice.,The question is how bad do you want all the boxed sets together and not the heads. I hate them that much. I hate to buy the same dvd twice but it is my favorite show and worth it in the end. And like many others have said one of the best seasons.
1,WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT BOX?,"Seriously, I will be ashamed to buy some thing of that shape, I thought the simpsons was targeted especially for adults, what's with the cheesy box shape?"
1,"Love the product, despise the packaging","As the title states, my problem is with the packaging, not the DVDs. I have read that the sixth season has available the regular box for storage instead of the pathetic platic head which does little to protect the DVDs inside. The problem is that I have recieved this set as a gift.To be able to send away for the box, you must have proof of purchase. The set I've recieved came without anything inside except the DVDs. No receipt, no UPC code on the box and no proof of purchase. Therefore, no box. Fox refuses to send me a box, not even if I offer to pay for it as well as the shipping and handling. If I want the Box, I'll Have to purchase another set and use the information from that. Also, this offer only applies to the sixth season. I also have season seven in the plastic Marge head, recieved as a gift, and I hate that packaging just as much. This they do not give the option of purchasing the case. What a ripoff!!!!"
3,taking care of your stuff,"These Amazon reviews are great to decide if you want to buy something, but they also provide a forum for customers to communicate with the corporations.Taking care of your stuff is important. A DVD collection of any size involves a lot of money. Properly caring for and storing DVDs is a major issue -- corporate marketers and commercial artists defending their territories by ineptly pretending to be kids notwithstanding. (And don't assume people will buy anything. I know people who subscribe to Netflix, etc. specifically so they can copy TV series DVDs. The corporations should pay attention to those of us who are still willing to pay extra to have the real thing.)Hopefully this and future The Simpsons seasons will be available in a package that is reasonable and consistant with past practices. Special packages should also be available to those who find that appealing. Then everyone can be happy."
3,"Great episodes, kind of insulting commentary.","I have seasons 1-6 on DVD and have always enjoyed listening to the commentary for the episodes; the commentaries are often informative, and almost as entertaining as the episodes themselves. However, I find myself being continually insulted by the commentary on the Season Six DVDs. The writers and directors keep feeling the need to explain their jokes and references, assuming that the audience won't notice the sight gags and homages otherwise (""See, this is a reference to a Japanese cartoon about a lion named Kimba . . .""). The intelligence of the comedy is a big reason why ""The Simpsons"" has such a huge following to begin with -- we GET it, that's why we bought the damned DVDs."
5,THE BEST,"I just got this season last night, and it is great! Who Shot Mr. Burns Part.1 is classic, and a great episode. Also they have Lisa on Ice, which is one of the best episodes. (in my opinion) Its wierd that amazon said it will be released on the 16th, because its still a couple of days until then. Either way, I still have it. BEST DVD"
4,"Not the best season, but has a few great moments","I hate the new box. Once you get the replacement box, its all worth it."
1,The Simpsons - The Complete Sixth Season,"The dvd's are great but the case sucks, why don't they leave the case the same as the last 5 seasons, 1 star rating for making season 6 look stupid next to seasons 1-5."
4,What's really imporant?,"First off, I enjoy the design of the new packaging, but it is poorly (cheaply) constructed. But lets face it, if the producers release all 17 seasons, you can't expect things not to change over a run that long.Also, the fact that they are offering a box for the ""anal-retentive nerds"" or ""those who dislike storing their digital media inside a hollowed out human head"" does not show an admission of error on fox's part, but simply a commitment to keeping their customers happy. And that should not be bashed by saying 'That's like admitting that they made a big mistake.' Who cares? Maybe they did, and at least they're giving the nerds the option.Whats really important is that this series has some great episodes. Let that be the deciding factor, and not what it comes in, because you can complain about it all you want, but I, for one, have never known a distributor to go to these lengths to make sure everyone is satisfied."
2,Worst Packaging Ever!,"The content deserves 5 stars. It's so good that the cheap, ugly, flimsy packaging would ordinarily only bring it down to 4 stars. If I could have gone to Simpson's box.com and obtained the original packaging for $2.95 without being told I ""fear change"" or that I'm ""anal retentive"" or a ""big baby"" I would have given the 5 stars back. Change can be good, but this thing sucks and Fox needs to know how bad. It's worse than the original series Star Trek packaging, making it the... worst packaging ever!!!!"
5,Great episodes! - Case is OK.,"I always transfer my purchased DVDs to thin jewel cases to save space. I then either store or junk (depending on case and artwork quality) the original cases. So I like the fact that the inner 4 DVD holder of the Simpsons Season 6 set is removable. I was able to use it instead of 4 thin jewel cases. However, it is poorly constructed and I had to reinforce it with packing tape so it wouldn't fall apart. I do like how the case (head and all) looks, but also feel that Fox should of spent a bit more $$ contructing it better in order to avoid (or at least reduce) the complaints that were sure to come.However, the improtant thing is the episodes. I found all the episodes in Season 6 to be enjoyable. I don't remember when The Simpsons started going downhill, but it wasn't during season 6. I still watch each and every new episode of the Simpsons, but there was a point where the episodes were just not as funny."
5,Alternate Box Art!!!,"The Alternitive box art has just been released. It is viewable at (...). It is gray, it has several of the other simpsons charecters on it, It is NOT LIKE THE PREVIOUS SETS, it has a picture of homer with a magnifying glass up to his eye."
3,The case is JUNK!,"The case is garbage! Fox's attitude that people lack a sense of humor for not wanting this cheap selfdestructing piece of crap instead of a real case is insulting. Nobody HAS to buy future editions, especially when the qualtiy began to decline a bit. It was a wretchedly designed piece of junk and Fox should be ashamed of themselves for trying to blame the customers for their mistake.the sixth season was excellent, by the way, if you can figure out how to get the case open without it breaking."
1,WTF Fox...nice package,"How sad is this. I loved my ever growing Simpsons DVD collection, but now I don't know if I even want to continue to buy. The packing is horrible. Now my DVD shelves will look a little off because some helmet wearing head case thought it would be ha ha funny to make the case Homer's head.Worst idea in the history of the Simpsons...may god have mercy on their souls."
1,I won't buy it until they use the correct packaging,"Yes, I know all about the 800 number and web site to get the other (correct) packaging. That's the approach they should have used to get the Homer's head package, for people that wanted it.Release the package correctly, please. Hopefully, Fox learned a lesson with the stupid decision they made with this release."
4,On the box art,"I work in a music store and had the package in my hands tonight. The case is made of cheap, *cheap* plastic, hinged at the bottom in a clamshell design, and held together with nothing more than tape, which means that shoplifting of the DVDs is going to be a major concern with retailers. The head is covered in a plastic slipcase that mimics the previous seasons' design on the side. The slipcase doesn't fit very well, and doesn't improve the look of the case at all.There is NO second box inside. However-- here's the good news. There is a card inside the box with a phone number you can call to get a regular box for the discs-- this is probably where the ""Green box"" pictures have come from. The clamshell won't last very long-- the plastic isn't sturdy enough-- so I suspect many, *many* people will be taking advantage of this offer sooner or later.Worst. Packaging. Ever. But at least we can send off for a real box. Hopefully they won't repeat this nonsense."
3,Worst Packaging Ever!,"We all know and love the season 6 episodes. I want to talk about how horrible the packaging is.The whole big yellow monstrosity comes in a flimsy clear plastic sleeve. By the time mine arrived it was already splitting slightly at the seams. The head itself opens like a bigmac container and feels incredibly flimsy.Here's the good news...sort ofYou can order a replacement case from Fox. You have to pay 3 dollar shipping, for something you should have gotten originally, but the big yellow head packaging is so horrible it's worth it.I give the actual show content 5 stars, and the packaging 1 star, for an average of 3."
5,Probably the best season.... still has some crappy episodes,"i love a lot of these episodes. There are still some bad ones with no point.Like The Teehouse of Horror V, the only reason they keep making these episodes are because its a Simpson tradition that happens annually around Hallloween. I believe this is the point where this segment starts falling apart.Itchy and scratchy land is also another bad episode. I mean who would want to see the simpsons do the things they do in this episode. Only puny 10 year olds would.Otherwise, the whole season is good."
1,"Too Late, FOX","This re-relase of Simpsons Season 6 dvd really makes me mad. I've owned the original since it's release dat in August 2005 and sent for the replacement box right away. After 3 months, I never recieved it and I called them and they agreed to send a replacement. I had to do this rotuine so many times that I gave up and demanded a refund and then I never got my refund either. Sorry, Fox. As Joanna Nolle Levesque/JoJo sings, ""Too little, too late"""
3,La mejor serie de tv de todos los tiempos,"espero que la serie de los simpsons salgan mas seguido y con idioma a l español aqui en mexico adoramos a homero simpson incluyendome a mi jajajaja, por que tarda mucho en salir una serie de la otra ojala y no pase mucho tiempo para ver la 7 temporada"
5,Hollywood throws in the towel....,"I guess hollywood is officially out of ideas when 95% of TV is JARS (just another reality show) about Joe Blow or his 5th cousins uncle twice removed & 5 of the top selling DVD's are TV series. Most of the crappy TV series they're releasing weren't worth watching 30 years ago, much less today. And PLEASE stop with the sequels & remakes, I have no desire to see Friday the 13th, part 13 or King Kong(about the 8th remake), sorry Peter, I loved LOTR!Yes, the Simpsons rock, but they show reruns of it 9 times a day, get tivo man!"
3,Nuts,53 reviews of a product. (and now 54... look what you jackholes made me do.)53 reviewers who don't have the product in hand.You people need to find a more productive way of spending your time.
5,Simpsons Season 6 DVD,This is a great continuation for the simpsons series! I love the fun box that it comes in! Its definately worth getting to continue any simpsons collection!
4,OK-but I prefer Season 8,"There are some great episodes in this boxed set, but some are real let-downs, such as the episode ""Sideshow Bob Roberts"". After ""Cape Feare"", I had high hopes for the fourth Sideshow Bob episode, but the only good bit was when Bart and Lisa tried to show that the other Mayor Elect was better and Bart got taken away by Bob's guard people. That was also the most suspensing bit, because those guys were about to do something... I won't say what happens though. My top five episodes were:Lisa's RivalRound SpringfieldBart's GirlfriendLisa On IceBart Vs AustraliaSo buy the boxed set before it's sold out!"
4,I really don't mind the head,"It wasn't the head design that bothered me, it was the jewel case insert. It falls off the cardboard holded/folder, because it's only held on with two little strips of sticky tape like gluish substance. (the stuff they use to attach make-up samples to magazines) Now that I vented I feel much better. Season 6 is my personal favorite, so that is really all that matters."
4,"here's where to jokes get more obtuse, but not as funny as season 7.","If you've come this far, you'll probably buy it anyway. The box is awkward of course and cheaper than the previous sets, so that's kind of a bummer. To me, season 7(Marge on cover) really refines the humor that they started to go for in season 6, which is more off the wall, more Homer centered, and more one-liner-esque. Of course, they split the ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" between 6 and 7, just as it happened on tv, so be ready for that. Other than that, season 7 really delivers where 6 misses the spot (for my taste in Simpsons humor.)"
3,new box,"I think that though this box is cool, it should be used for some other simpsons dvd.It will certainly clash with others and who knows if it will even fit in my cabinet.I will not boycot the series collection because of this.I will only be slightly irritated. They should have kept with the 1-5 packaging."
1,I've made a huge mistake.,"I ignored comments about the packaging and bought the set anyway. Big mistake. Once you finally pop the flimsy clam shell open, the folder inside pops out at you and the disc holders fall out. Right now the set sits in pieces on my TV and I just can't bring myself to put the thing back together. Inside the pack is an insulting little card with instructions to call a phone number where you are further insulted and sent to a web-site where you are again insulted as you follow instructions to order a different package, for which you pay a handling charge, the final insult.It took me two weeks to get over the negative vibe from the packaging to finally pop in the discs and start watching, and, well, the laughs are few and far between.I've made a huge mistake."
5,I like the box,"Why is everybody crying over the packaging? It looks awesome, and as for the ""flimsy package sure to break"", what are you doing to your dvd's man, throwing them against the wall? If your normal and just plan on keeping them on the shelf (or ghetto style in a shoe box like me) there is nothing to worry about. Really the package is cool, the inside has clear dvd holders that you flip through like a book.Of course the dvds themselves are loaded with tons of extras: boring commentary, boring storyboards...all I care about are deleted and extended scenes. The episodes are classic and hilarious. Of course this has the Who shot Mr Burns ep. How fun was that trying to guess back in the day? I suspected Barney for some reason... So yeah Season 6, Season 5- as good as it gets people buy this and buy Arrested Development and Strangers With Candy on dvd also, because they are amazing."
5,Several classics in season six...packaging isn't that bad.,"Season six is very solid. It gave us several classics like Homer Badman and A Star is Burns, and contains perhaps the best Treehouse of Horror episode ever. The so-called bad packaging isn't a reason not to buy the DVDs. I haven't had any trouble with mine. It's not half as bad as everyone on here says it is. Yeah, it's a little cheap, but nothing like I was expecting after reading the reviews on here. Grow up, you retards. You don't watch the packaging. If something small like that keeps you from enjoying the episodes then you don't deserve to enjoy them."
5,Great Season,"This is a great season to own of The Simpsons. ""Homer the Great"" (aka the Stonecutters episode) and ""Lisa on Ice"" are on Disc 2!"
5,Nerd.obsessive.org,"Worst design and color scheme ever......Since you are unfamiliar with sarcasm, I will close the register at this point. Just buy it and watch the best show ever. They were still perfect in season 6. Great episodes. Simpsons had hearfelt emotion and clever, subtle satire and irony. When simpsons lost the writing and emotion (maybe season 8 or 9? that's when it went downhill.Family guy is funny, but clearly a rip off and family guy has no character development or emotional attachment. Family guy is just bunh of stupid, funny things that happen. It is even funnier when stoned, but simpsons in its prime is unbeatable. Oh yeah and little kids cussing is not funny. South park can bite me. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky."
1,Bad shipping,"The box was broken, really broken. I've a simpsons collection and i'm disappointed by the quality of that one."
5,Mark,"Be aware, if you don't like the box of ""Homer's Head"" You can actually order the box, just like the other five seasons prior to the sixth season. Go to www.simpsonsbox.com. All you pay is $2.95 for shipping and handling. The box is free. It asks you to send either the ""proof of purchase"" or ""original receipt"" or one more thing, I don't remember. Go now, to the website. Enjoy."
1,The old packaging sucked too...,"Yeah, the new box bites--you can contact the Fox people for a replacement similar to the previous box sets, or so I've heard. Still, those old fold-out custom digi-whatever cases are ungainly and unattractive, and, inexcusably so, given that other season sets for minor Fox shows like Wonderfalls, Lone Gunmen, Arrested Development and, yes, Futurama, come in sleek individual digipaks, which have become the industry standard. A DVD should not have to be ""unfurled"" on one's coffee table or bedspread: it just ain't right. Is a repackaging double-dip in the works? I think the Fox people would be pleasantly surprised by the number of us geeks, er, customers, who'd be willing to buy up."
3,"OH, PLEASE . . .","Yes, the Simpsons are great; the best thing ever on television, blah-di-blah-di-blah. That's a given. That Fox merchandising executives have a single micron of brain-matter in their swollen heads, well, that's not such a given.Were they nuts doing this cheap plastic packaging? Of course, the 800 number insert with the set is a confession (a last-minute stab of remorse or, worse for them, fear that the purchasing public would NOT race to buy this set when word of mouth got out about the ludicrous packaging?) that they really screwed up. I think it's unpardonable that, firstly, they jokingly (?) insult us by accusing us of anal retentiveness by wanting decent packaging and, secondly, that we have to pay for what should have been the boxes similar to the other 5 (FIVE!) sets. Three stars only -- not for the content (all praise to Matt Groening), but for the idiotic plastic container.Call and complain, folks. Fox . . . what a sad joke."
2,Great Episodes. Dreadful packaging.,"I hate to think what Fox Marketing was thinking when they designed this box. The character head gimick is just a distraction to the fact that they used cheap plastic to package the product probably in order to increase profit margins.I still bought it today, but that doesn't mean that I approve of its design at all. The box is impractical and flimsy. And it looks horrendous when sitting next to the rest of my DVDs. There was nothing wrong with the cardboard box design. It was durable, and it kept the contents from harm. This new flimsy packaging is just ready to fall apart the moment you buy it."
3,Have it YOUR way set packaging,"For those who complain that they don't like the new Simpsons set packaging....guess what...you can have the old packaging.From the digital bits website: http://www.digitalbits.com :Also today, those of you who happened to pick up 20th Century Fox's The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season today will find a little card inside your packaging... ""For all those that fear change."" Basically, if you don't like the new ""character head"" packaging, Fox is offering to send you (for the cost of the postage) replacement packaging for the Season 6 set that matches the packaging for Seasons 1-5. All you have to do is call 1-800-223-2369 for instructions (yes 1-800 - the 800 number has finally been activated), OR visit the special simpsonsbox.com website the studio has created to handle the replacement program. You know, I have to give Fox a lot of credit, both for trying something new with their packaging AND for offering to take care of the fans who preferred it the old way."
3,Whiny Jerks,"The Simpsons is a great show, but they have shown their sour side by being a bunch of whiny jerks with this packaging fiasco. They make it clear they have contempt for their fans and that has repercussions. Either these guys are just mean or they're starting to hate their jobs. I hope they learn a lesson from all of this. The only cure to hubris is humbling."
3,THE BOX SUCKS,the Simpsons are funny. the product was cheap and it came in great time. I didn't have to wait long at all.
5,"The Simpsons Season Six - Sweet, Sweet Can","When you have classic episodes such as Bart of Darkness, Treehouse of Horror V(The Shinning,Time and Punishment,Nightmare Cafeteria) , Bart's Girlfriend, Lisa on Ice, Homer Bad Man, Grandpa vs. Sexual Inadequacy,And Maggie Makes Three, Bart's Comet, Homie the Clown, Homer vs. Patty and Selma, A Star is Burns, The PTA Disbands, Round Springfield, The Springfield Connection, Lemon of Troy, Who Shot Mr. Burns, how could you complain about the flimsy plastic packaging?"
5,"Great Simpsons Episodes, Terrible Packaging","Once again, great box of new Simpsons episodes on DVD. What were they thinking when they desiged the packaging? Cheap plastic that will crack eventually.... Doesn't stack nicely with the previous five boxes....Aarrgh."
3,Good Show Horrible Packaging,"Whoever designed this package should be fired... It is the worst design DVD case/package I've ever seen ... ever - and I have a lot of DVDs. Anyway, the DVDs played fine despite the packaging. Definitely get the box design package instead of the head package..."
3,Look out! We're jumping the shark!,"While there are big guffaws here, in lots of unexpected little places, the series is already starting to consume itself. The storylines are getting ridiculous, many of the jokes are just stupid, the chartacters always say predictible things, and the animation is getting more sophisticated (kiss of death). This is where they started to jump the shark: No longer are crowds of Springfield residents made up of anonymous people: It's always Krusty, Doctor Nick, Doc. Hibbert, Sideshow Mel, Flanders etc. I always found this such a cheap trick - they're just re-using the already-drawn characters instead of having to come up with no-name people in a crowd. Quimby and Wiggum are already being trotted out for no more than cheap and easy laughs. Although I think some of these episodes are inspired, it can't hold a candle to Seasons 4 or 5. And I stopped watching the new ones three or four years ago; they're just awful. Matt: Why don't you quit while you're ahead?"
3,"mmm,sacriligious...or not?","This box set has some of my favorite episodes,such as Homie the Clown or Homer,Bad Man.Normally it would be worth buying for those episodes alone.One problem though... as another reviewer mentioned this is indeed the worst box set ever.It is really crummy.Fox is trapping us between schylla and charivdi(translation:if you buy the box set and keep it you will have to stand the crummy designing and the falling apart.If you deside to order the old box set ,that episodes 1-5 had, you will have to give the Man(fox that is) your post number so they can send you millions of junk mail).It is a lose-lose situation.I am going to buy it because i am a big fan of the simpsons episodes.But for you lesser fans that aren't nuts about them you'd better think twice before you buy it.There will always be re-runs for you to tape.I can't give the simpsons less than three stars,because I love them so, but I fully understand why others do and I certainly can't blaim them."
1,STUPID PACKAGING & SHAMEFUL OFFER,"When you receive this set, they offer a regular box you can set on the shelf, for an additional $2.98. What arrives four weeks later is a piece of folded paper that makes a slip cover for the already very poor disc holder.20th Century Fox Entertainment should be boycotted. They make almost three dollars on something which costs them likely 8 cents - all in addition to the original cost of the discs.I love THE SIMPSONS, but I am returning this piece of folded paper along with an invoice for a four disc jewel case."
3,"Same old Simpson laughs, but stupid new packaging.","This is typical Simpsons, with some very funny episodes, and some that are just silly. However, someone in marketing got paid big bucks to design a package shaped like Homer's head. Unfortunately, it can not stand up, sit on edge, and does not contain an inner box, so you can not just throw away the outer package. If you want a standard size box to store these in, you have to send them a check for #2.95.Congratulations! Market demolishes common sense once again."
3,And the downhill slide begins...,"In season 6, suddenly the funny ebbs away. There are still a few chuckles, still a few belly laughs, but nothing resembling the quality that peaked in seasons 4 and 5. However, it is still the best animation ever, so I would given it a higher rating were it not for the packaging. My advice is to put the discs into those round flat jewel cases, so that when they fall out of the pack and onto the floor, it will hopefully only crack the case and not wreck the discs, or trash the packaging and store them in jewel cases on a shelf or something."
5,Best Season Ever,"Okay, I'm a huge Simpsons fan from day one and I love all the episodes before they started going down hill. I didn't want to buy any of the DVDs yet because I can just watch them during reruns, BUT I've been waiting for the season that had the ""Homie the Clown"" episode. That has got to be the best Simpsons episode ever!! Every single moment of that episode is funny. From new billboard day to putting speedholes in the car. Anyways, back to the point, I got the DVD just because of this episode. But, my wife was reviewing the other episodes, and it also has other really, really good episodes. Like the sugar episode and when they went to Australia. So, if you don't plan on buying any of the DVDs, buy this one because it's the best season ever."
5,SIMPSONS ALTERNATE BOX RELEASED,for all that have complained about the crappy box. Here is the moment you have been waiting for it is a grey box wtih a picutre of homer on it with a magnifiging glass and a big eye.I am not sure if the Grey case slides over the orignal becuase it has a big eye but i noticed the pupil was in diffefent directions.
4,Funny,"The dude is stupid, man. That's why he's so funny. It's not the best of show but check it out."
5,Not the last great season of the simpsons.,"There are some problems with this season, admittedly. Some of these episodes simply go nowhere, and I personally was never a fan of ""The Critic"". But, BUT, overall this season is fantastic, where there are several classic episodes. I am waiting for seasons seven and eight, which I think are also worth buying. Personal favorites - the classic Homer the Great, for stretching the Simpsons universe to include secret societies (which every male seems to be a part of), the Halloween episode (the toaster segment still cracks me up after the 50th time) and Who Shot Mr Burns (yeah, it was a gimmick, but what a clever gimmick). And yes, the packaging sucks - you can maybe still send away for a real box, mine came with a slip to do so."
4,"Episodes 5 Stars, Packaging 0 Stars","The episodes are great (some of the best), no argument.It is hands down the worst packaging out of any of my box sets and I have about 25 box sets. You'd figure the packaging would get better as the seasons go? To make it even worse they give you an offer to send in $3.00 for a good package. I have no idea what these people are/were thinking when dealing with this packaging. Yes you'll have to send in $3.00 for a quality box, but once it's done you'll have one of the best box sets to date. I hope they learn their lesson for season 7."
1,Change is good?,"5 seasons released of perfectly fine form-fitted box sets to nicely line collection shelves and now this....I'm no Adrian Monk, but as previous reviewers have stated whoever designed this packaging needs to go back to work for McDonalds. Is this a trend? Can we expect more of the same for seasons 7-10? Oh the Homanity...."
2,Actually 2 1/2 Stars because of the bad box.,"Episodes 5 STARS, Homer Box 0 (ZERO) STARS. So I got to give it 2 1/2 stars.Episodes were good but the box is JUNK! Amazon.com shows the box standing up in their picture, but there is no way for this box to stand up! Mine cracked on the hinge after opening it four times. Another couple more and it will split apart!They should have made it a tin cover at least so it could stand up. They knew they screwed up when they had to put that notice inside so send away for a regular box. Damn marketing!!!!That box has got to go. Just remember folks, there is still the Marge, Bart, and Lisa box to go. Let your voice be heard so that they change the box to tin at least!"
5,best show ever,"I really Love the Show. Now i can watch it whenever I want, and dont have to wait till show times ."
1,predictable and trite,"I will be honest with you. I could not get into this book at all. I did not even finish it. It was written for the Harlequin Romance Crowd. The characters were banal. No one actually says, (and I am paraphrasing),""Do you think all Royal families in the world are dysfunctional as we are""? ""We are no different than the average commoner on the street"". If I wrote a paper like this when I was in college my professor would have torn it apart. I think the story would have been interesting if not for the stale character development. There were no surprises for this reader. I think the author would be better off going to Hollywood and writing a script for a B movie."
2,questionable quality for handle,"I did a little research on woks and finally decided on this one. Right out of the box, the handle had large cracks on each side. Put it back in the box taped it up and sent it back for refund.I went with this one because it was fairly thick, and seemed like a good buy, but i'm a bit skeptical of the handle quality."
3,"Pretty good, not quite","I don't like how all wok handles seem to attach to the wok. So I think my complaint is with most woks.I gave this a 3 star because the short handle on the opposite side has screws in it. So if you get the wok hot, and grab this handle, you'll burn yourself. So the handle is pretty useless."
3,Ok Wok,"I think it's probably an ok Wok.I did the seasoning as the instruction said, but it didn't get perfect I guess...After a few uses, it got scraped a little bit.. (I only used the wood spatula and didn't use soap but only water to clean).And it's a bit heavier than I thought... overall, it's ok and I'll keep using it, but next time when I need to change, I may try something else."
5,Outstanding Wok!,This wok seasons amazingly well due to the carbon steel nature and becomes non-stick with the right care quite rapidly. The large size makes stir frying and dry frying a cinch but also allows one to deep fry with impunity. Very easy to toss the ingredients due to the large diameter and handle.
1,Not so good.,Beautiful pot except not very useful. I have seasoned this pot at least 5 times now but it still rusts. Veggies become black.
4,"A lot of work, but worth it!","It took some effort to get the wok seasoned and it does require more care than the normal non-stick pans that I'm used to, (ie drying the pan on the stove instead of w/ a dish towel, oiling the pan before storing it away).I have used it a few times for stir-fry meals now. The food was great and the wok was fun to use. I have not had any problems with rusting like some of the other reviewers suggest. I think that you just have to season the pan correctly. I used my gas stove to do this. I think this may be very dificult to do w/ other types of stoves. I did have problems seasoning the parts of the wok where the handles were connected to the bowl. I did not get the nice, smooth, black patina, that I was able to achieve on the other interior regions of the pan."
5,Absolutely Fabulous,"This is the best cooking vessel I've ever used, bar none. Easy to season, heats quickly and evenly, and allows an even and crisp sear to foods. Made pan fried noodles tonight, turned out perfectly. Seared some pork tenderloin and made a pork and veggie stir fry a few days ago. Perfect. First dish I made in my 'beloved' new wok was seared tofu and shrimp Thai curry, also fabulous! When I'm done cooking, I just use a few wadded paper towels to wipe it out, recoat with a little oil if necessary, and done! I just can't say enough good things about this wok. If you want the real deal, this is it. Just a detail, I'm using a ceramic top electric stove. It might perform even better with a gas range. More wok entrees are on the way! Makes cooking fun!!"
3,Nice construction. Very Heavy,"Very nicely constructed pan. Nice riveting and phenolic handles that wont trap bacteria or deteriorate over time as wood handles do. Only drawback is that this pan is VERY heavy. If you are OK with simply setting the pan on the stove and stirring, you will be happy. If you like to toss the food as you cook, this pan will be extremely heavy once food is added. Dry weight is approx.4-5 lbs!"
2,understand before you buy,"Before you buy, realize this wok comes w/ a factory lacquer that is very difficult to remove. I followed their instructions, and could not remove the protective coating.I had to take it into my restaurant and alternate boiling water in it and scrubbing w/ steel wool and heavy abrasive cleaner. I'm not sure if I managed to remove it because it hasn't seasoned properly, but I figure if the coating hasn't come off by now, it's not coming off in my food. I would advise against purchasing this wok."
1,Waste of Money,"Seasoned the new wok as per directions and used the wok once. Theinside did great. Washed it with plain water and a sponge, driedit with paper towels, and put it on the heat for some minutes -- thenwiped the inside with a little oil andhung it on the wall. The whole outside of the wok has rusted. I intend to discard it."
2,Pros and CONs,"Pros,Generous size; Flat bottom, no need for a wok stand; No coating chemical after initial cleanup.Cons,Uneven heating, one has to constantly stir to avoid burnt spots--stressful! Also melted my spatula rated for 500+ Fahrenheit.Rust very easily. Keep it oily and only clean with detergent once in a while, which is something I'm uncomfortable with.It's tedious to remove the coating before the first use, as described by other reviews."
2,Disappointed with product,"I am not a professional cook but I cook for my family everyday and I do a lot of stir frys. Despite following the directions to season this pan, it developed uneven coloring and blotchy dark spots on the inside - multiple seasonings did not correct this.It has several hot spots and I have gotten used to managing around this, but I would have paid more for a pre-seasoned wok if I had known."
2,Not good Wok,"When I received the wok, I seasoned it as instructed. The wok burnt and looked really bad before even using it. Planning to return it if possible. Not good!"
1,Immediate rust!,"I seasoned the wok according to the directions included with the wok, but it rusted after first use. Tried cleaning and reseasoning, but that ship has sailed. Into the trash it goes!"
1,it's not good,"After I seasoned it, the interior bottom became ugly dark brown color. Now I am not sure if I will use it at all."
2,"Sharp metal pieces, not really fiesta 'Plum' in color...","I received this flatware set today and opened it to find it matched my fiesta heather plates perfectly, but was not dark like fiesta plum dishes are. There were also some sharp metal edges peaking out from the end caps near the base of a spoon and a fork. I have 5 other colors of this type of flatware that match the stated color perfectly - so I will try another order in case these ones were just marked wrong. If they arrive without the sharp edges, I'll live with the shade problem if it's still apparent."
5,"Great, insightful read","This is a brief, well balanced account of the conflict between Galileo and the Church. It opens with an insightful look at the world view and astronomy of the late 1500's, including a detailed look at the role of Scripture in these views. This is followed with a thorough description of Galileo's life and how his conflict with the church unfolded. The final chapter is a fascinating overview of the relationships between faith, science and philosophy since Galileo's time. It's not overly difficult reading, though it deals with science, theology and philosophy. The book is a fair account, looking at the strengths and weaknesses of Galileo and some Church officials in how they approached the issues. It also critiques some long held cultural assumptions about the causes, events and meaning of this case (ex: Galileo was never tortured; some lower Church officials who disliked Galileo gave the Pope misleading reports, etc). Definitely worth reading!!"
5,Short Review,"I really enjoyed reading this book. This book is mainly about Galileo's theory of universe and the trial of Galileo which was caused by his conflict with the Catholic Church. This book also talks about Galileo's life briefly. I learned about theories that influenced Galileo's ideas and his opinion toward Copernicus's theory which stated that the all of the planets, including the earth, revolved around the sun."
4,Fine ideas for quite original greeting cards,"Are You bored of the trivial greeting cards they sell in shops ?Are You looking for a special card for a special gift ?Would You like to teach Your children how to use paper, paint and scissors ?This book is for You."
1,No support at all,"This is a terrible product. It offers no support for any part of your body. The ""bubble"" circles are empty and collapse when you sit on them. I was very disappointed and returned the seat cushion. I do not recommend this product."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Yet another male-female alien pairing of agent and other.Or, in other words, this book isn't very good at all compared to the others. Throw in some philosophy of the whole thing, sword fighting, an Ancient site, and not a lot of point to this one.For example:""Rondl floated before a class of twenty young Bands. All were attentive to his beam as it flashed across the enclosure and reflected from the curving wall. Could he get his message across?""This is the story of the ugly Solarian and the three innocent species,"" he said. He had the nagging feeling he had adapted the story from some other narration, but he could not think what that might be. There was nothing similar he knew of in Band lore. ""The Solarian is a gross physical creature with bone-filled extremities, flesh-filled torso, and liquid-filled eyeballs sliding within moist sockets,"""

5,A surprisingly GOOD movie,"This was a really great movie. There was a really good job of keeping the movie realistic (not far-fetched), while still being suspenseful and exciting. The way some of the pool shooting was captured/shot was really cool. The movie will make you want to go play pool after you watch it. It sort of has a bit of the ""Rounders"" movie feel to it with the storyline and all."
2,Does not run the table,"First off, I have to give the director credit for getting Walken (who is always fun to watch) and Palminteri to do this movie. Ricky Shroeder was a good addition as well.Now for the less positive news.This looks like a student film done by a rich kid. The movie was obviously shot over a long period of time and on a small budget, and sort of stitched together. Characters come out of nowhere and they never really get fleshed out. The plot jumps around, and every cliché in the book was trotted out.Worst of all, the director cast himself in the lead, and he's not a very convincing actor. The actress who plays his girlfriend isn't ready for primetime, either. With better leads, a better editor, and a more cohesive plot, maybe. But as it stands, the movie is a mess.So, bad movie. But a heck of a try."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"this is movie is quite possibly the WORST movie I have ever seen in my life....the acting is pathetic, the shots reused over and over again , the script laughable(see ""what did I stutter.."")the plot pitiful. the only saving grace for this movie was the addition of Christopher Walken to the cast...his apperance makes the pain bearable, although I can't figure out why he decided to do this movie, my theory is he lost a game of pool to the director and landed up getting hustled to the play the part......if you're fan of pool take my advice and watch the Color of Money with Tom Cruise instead....even though that movie was made in the 80's and with the monoexpressioned Cruise it beats this movie out hands down."
1,"IF YOU PLAY POOL, THE LACK OF PROPER FORM WILL DRIVE YOU NUTS","THE POOL SHOTS IN THIS MOVIE ARE A JOKE. EVER HEAR OF STAYING DOWN, LIL' RICKY POPS UP ON EVERY SHOT HE TAKES"
2,Good rental,"The reason I picked up this movie was for one actor and one actor only....Christopher Walken. Now he wasn't in much, but he does get the chance to steal the film with one of his classic monologes.""Poolhall Junkies"" is one of those movies that even though its predictable you still continue to watch. Films moves and you don't get bored watching. Rick Schroder as the Pool Pro/Poolhall Hustler was very good. He didn't say much, but his facials and his bodylanguage proved to me this guy is one not to reckon with.Gregory ""Mars"" Martin who directed, wrote and starred in this movie was the only thing I really didn't like. He should stay behind the camera. Just didn't buy him as a lead man.Like I said, this movie is a fun rental. I wouldn't waste your money though."
2,Junk in a Poolhall,"Finally viewed this one after everyone hyped it. It was an okay movie, nothing exciting and certainly not worth the cult status it supposedly has. If you've seen one pool movie, you've seen this one. Mars Callahan should either get acting lessons or quit altogether because his character and the way he portrayed him was the most unbelieveable thing in this film.""The Shooting Gallery"" was a better film in all areas compared to this one in my opinion. Of course there is always the ""Color of Money"" and the unbeatable ""The Hustler""."
4,Not too shabby.,"While this film is a tad predictible, it's still a lot of fun. The trick shots are a blast to watch, the soundtrack is awesome and there are a few laughs and surprises.Honestly, though, how can you go wrong with a movie starring Christopher Walken, Chazz Palminteri and Michael Rosenbaum? All three give stellar performances, and are completely entertaining, especially Rosenbaum (all bad lip-syncing aside)."
1,False advertising,"The product was advertised as new/unopened. Upon receiving and opening the packaging for the DVD, I noticed that it had been re-packaged. The DVD was not in its original wrapping with appropriate labels and had obviously been opened. I inspected the DVD and noticed marks on the delicate side of the disc, which looked like something had been spilled on it at one time. The DVD appears to work with no problem (which is the only reason I have not returned the product), however I am not happy with the deception used regarding the state of use of this product."
2,"Not even close to ""The Hustler"" or ""Color of Money""",Sorry but I can not comprehend people rating this on par with Color of Money or the Hustler. If you like pool and have seen the previous films don't get your hopes up. Its worth watching because there is nothing new out on the game.
1,Skip this,"The only thing worse than the dialog/acting is the shooting/hustling. This movie makes Whoopie's ""Kiss Shot"" look like academy award material."
4,Rockin,"It's always a good time when Christopher Wanken is in a movie. It's safe to assume that this is pretty much the selling point of ""Poolhall Junkies,"" which is unfortunate. While Christopher Walken always is up to potential, there's more to this movie that a cool older dude.The acting is not great all around. Most of the actors are really anything but, which is fine because the script is so compleatly entertaining, it really doesn't matter.The plot is pretty simple. Great pool player gives up going pro for a more realistic dream, also because his girlfriend thinks he can do better things with his life. However, once his brother gets in some hot water with them mob, he's forced back to being a poolhall hustler.All in all, it's a really good time."
5,Terrific movie that no one seems to have heard of.,"The writer-director-star, Mars Callahan, deserves a hell-of-a-lot more recognition & opportunities to write, direct, & perform.Christopher Walken in a small role is fantastic. Chazz Palmentieri, terrific, too.Just a wonderful movie."
5,This is the best underrated movie of all time.,This is the best underrated movie I have ever seen. I would recommend anyone to watch this movie. Mars Callahan needs to come out with another.
4,Love this Movie,"I purchased this for the second time!! I love this movie. It is a great movie--plot kinda lame, but full of clever one-liners and great billiard action! Christopher Walken is great in this movie. The primary star is also the writer and I believe he directed. There are a couple other big stars in this 'B' movie, such as Michael Rosenbaum-from Smallville, Chazz Palmenteri, Rick Schroeder, and Alison Eastwood- Clint Eastwood's daughter. Poolhall Junkies lives up to its name featuring a lot of billiard action. Love this movie! I get all my friends and even family to watch it and they all love it too!"
4,PoolHall Junkies,The movie is very good. And some of the trick shots that were used wee're amazing. I've always enjoyed poolhall movies. Everyone that has seen this movie has enjoyed it. I've given a few away as gifts. So far I've brought it 5 times.
3,Mustang Gt,I thought it was a good movie its got a little bit of every thing but the average person might not like it if they are not into pool.But if you like pool then you need to add this movie to your collection.
4,City of Vice - gritty and fascinating,"This is not a pretty as a picture postcard lolly box view of 18th century London.It is a gritty portrayal of the chaos that existed before a police service was established in Hogarth's era (think Rake's and Harlot's Progress paintings).I really enjoyed it, in all it's somewhat gory reality."
2,"Worked great, for about 3 months","When I first got this razor I thought it was the greatest thing ever. It's completly waterproof, so cleaning it is simple, you just run it under the water and add soap. It also gave me a really close shave, which was what I was looking for.Unfortunatly the razor refuses to charge, and I'm not sure why. Because the razor cannot be pluged directly into the wall, it is completly useless. Hopefully I just got a bad one, and everyone else's works fine, because this was a very nice razor, when it worked. I would however not recomend buying a razor that cannot plug into the wall."
4,Curriculum And Aims,"This is a good read! It makes one think aobut ;not only the historical aims of education but the political ones. The authors have backed up their ideas and issues with current data and information. questions are raised to invite thinking and discussion. The text also discusses the affects curriculum design, implementation and decision making have on teachers, students, administrators, politicians, parents and society in general."
4,great chairs,"The chairs look so great in our home. The only complaint that I have was one of the cushions had a run in them. We didn't want to return them so we just kept it. The directions to put the chairs together need to be much clearer and only send the right set of screws, not one good set and the set that the customer is supposed to ignore. Other then that, The chairs were a great price and look fantastic!"
2,Just Don't Crack the thermal lining....,"I loved this product for the first two months. Then while a friend cleaned it, they cracked the thermal lining. You can't buy a replacement in a store. It took FOUR MONTHS for the company to send a new one. FOUR MONTHS. Last week the ""on"" light would go on, but it did not brew. It has effectively died. What a total disappointment."
2,Not Hot,Coffee is not hot at brewing and becomes luke warm almost instantly. The lid is very hard to twist off after brewing. Way over priced just to have warm coffee.
2,Coffee all over my kitchen,"This coffee maker leaked all over my counter almost every other time I used it. I investigated the problem and tried positioning it differently, screwing the top on more or less, and it still leaked. If the top is left unscrewed almost all the way, the plungers are depressed far enough for the coffee to go in, but then you can't get the carafe out. What a pain."
2,"I loved it at first, but...","This machine made good coffee, and the coffee stays warm for hours (to get the best results, rinse carafe with hot water before brewing). However, after a few weeks, I could hear swishing that meant liquid had leaked from the glass lining inside of the carafe into the space between the glass and the plastic shell. No way to get it out. Soon after that, liquid started leaking out of the bottom of the carafe. Also, I found the lid very hard to keep clean. Coffee would get inside the lid and the only way I could get it out was to shake the lid - hard - repeatedly - to get the coffee to come out from the tiny holes."
1,rubber taste,We have followed all the manufacturer's instructions and there is a distinct rubber flavor to the brewed coffee.Terrible.
4,"Leaking, breaking caution, parts problem","I agree with two others on this problem, ""Water somehow accumulates between the outside metallic cover of the carafe and the inner glass liner. It leaks out the seam at the bottom"". Would like to caution people in hanlding the carafe. We broke one liner stirring in cream (to take the unit with prepared cofee). We broke another putting ice into cold coffee.To buy a carafe, if you call the 800 number on the box, they refer you to another 800 number. They will ask for the model number, as their are several. We had to look for TCM508 in very tiny print under the ""electrical caution"" notice on the bottom of the coffee maker. We bought two at aboutr $$-$$ US. There seems to be some room for negotiation.I don't know why they don't sell the carafes in the stores that sell the coffee makers."
3,Great until it wouldn't turn on!,"I've had this for just about over a year now and loved it, until yesterday when it just wouldn't turn on!!!! Home 24/7 with a 2yr old and an infant this pot allowed me to drink my coffee over the course of the morning. I was not at all pleased when I set it up to brew and nothing happened. I checked everything and know I have kept it clean but have no idea what is wrong with it. I tried it a few times, nothing..It just quit. Nothing happens, but the on light does indicate that it os ON. SO here I am looking for a new pot. Very inconvenient for a temporarily single mommy (hubby is in Iraq) with two screaming babies. Sleepless nights and long days, I depend on my morning coffee!!!!The other bad thing about this pot is the placement of the on button. I've unintentionally turned it on several times just by bumping the pot. Not very safe."
2,Coffee doesn't stay hot,"We may have received a defective unit. But the coffee comes out barely above luke warm, then within a couple of hours becomes cold in the carafe. It is also easy to not place the carafe firmly into the station. In that case the coffee goes everywhere but the carafe. We had an old Black and Decker carafe coffee maker for around 12 years that worked like a dream, coffee came out piping hot and stayed that way. That is why we bought the same make."
4,Piping hot coffee for hours,"I lug this carafe to work every day. While I sleep, it makes the most lovely cup of coffee. It drips into this insulated carafe that stays cool to the touch. The beautiful carafe keeps the coffe hot for hours. When you make coffee, it is so easy. The filter basket swings out nicely. The water reservoir opens and is easy to clean. There is even a little red ball to help with reading the water level. This machine makes a good cup of coffee and cuts itself off too. Dream machine with a stylish attitude."
2,"Makes nice cup of joe, but lousy carafe design","Yes, this model Black & Decker makes good coffee, and it keeps it hot for a while on the table, but... We got the product cheap because it's discontinued. We found, as other reviewers have said, it's all too easy to have an overflow issue--you need to be super careful about placing the carafe precisely on its seat. Plus a little coffee leaks into the space between the glass bottle and the vinyl casing. Then eventually it leaks out the bottom of the casing. It looks like you could remove the bottom cover (big slot in the middle), but I tried and couldn't budge it (there's a warning not to do that!). We're holding on to this thing until we get our money's worth, but will think twice before buying B&D again."
1,"Get the mop, you're going to make coffee...","What ever happened to Black and Decker? They used to have the best coffeemakers, especially Model TCM 413....we literally wore that puppy out. This new model is a real piece of work...floods the countertop it you look at it the wrong way. We may be senior citizens, but we're not stupid. This pot is a disaster and not worth the price. In fact, at Christmas it sold for $19.99 on black Friday, and I'd say that was about $15 too much. Anyone have a TCM 413? I'd pay big bucks..."
1,"SHAME ON YOU, Black & Decker","Ever wonder why you had to keep refilling your B&D Thermal Select Plus coffee maker? Because it only holds 6 cups instead of the 8 as advertised. Don't believe me? Simply measure it yourself. There is a slot in the back of the device that prevents no more than 6 cups. Once filled, the afixed measuring device on the left side reads 8 cups. Pretty sneaky, huh? Incidentally the carafe only hold 6 cups as well. SHAME ON YOU, Black & Decker !!!"
1,Imploding Carafes,"These carafes are crap! We bought the coffee maker for our office 3 months ago, and since then, the glass on the inside of our original carafe imploded while washing it out. We then bought a replacement carafe (for $24) that we no longer have- the replacement imploded too. I'm all set with losing an eye while doing the dishes. I'm buying a new coffee maker altogether."
1,flood warning,"No matter how careful we are, the coffee maker frequently ""floods"" the kitchen with partially brewed coffee and hot water all over the place.It seems like the brew thru lid mechanism is too sensitive to lid tightening, carafe placement, etc.Never again !"
2,Not nice glasses,"I bought a dozen of these. They are not nice glasses. Buy these glasses for large parties but not for personal consumption of bubbles. The rims are thick and the glasses are short and squatty. If you drink sparkling often or drink Champagne, please do not use these. Invest in something better"
3,Electrogravitation is real,"With production values that make Ed Wood's ""PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE"" look like ""CLEOPATRA,""this film is not a visual treat.There are however, some interestingfacts presented in the form of Documents, Unretouched photos and the like. The NAZI'S were the first to use the ALIEN MYTH to evade the Allies in their search forNAZI technology in the aftermath of the war....SEE OPERATION PAPERCLIP"
1,Oh dear,"Man, do i feel ripped off, i should of known just by looking at the cover. Home made baloney narrated by some moron who has not a clue about what he's talking about.Avoid."
1,omg,wow that is the STUPIDEST PLOT EVER i vote this the worst movie ever i am a world war 2 fan and this sucks dont buy it or rent it wast of money
3,Umm Kulthum: A Voice Like Egypt,"This is an interesting documentary about a music star little known in the United States, but I would have been glad to hear quite a bit more singing, in addition to the cultural history, not in preference to it. Only a few relatively short samples of her singing are offered. Perhaps the length of the presentation was limited, or it may be that few filmed records of her performances are available. One definitely does come to the end wishing to hear more of her singing."
3,Where to Get the Music,"This video is mostly about Umm Kulthum's social and political importance, which, it turns out, are equal to her wondrous musical abilities. If you want to hear her sing, go to a Middle Eastern grocery or deli that still has a Middle Eastern customer base. Off in a corner or maybe behind the check-out counter, they'll have 20 or 30 of her tapes. They'll be labeled in Arabic, so ask someone there for some good ones. If you're lucky, the person won't say, ""They're all good."" Of course, they are."
5,Great documentary,"Her life was as fascinating as her music. My only complaint is that I liked it so much, it wasn't long enough."
3,"Good format, but some puzzles not properly formed","This Sudoku book is both great and a major disappointment at the same time. The great part is that the puzzles are printed nice and big so that you have enough space in the number squares to write down the possibilities. And the paper is strong enough so that you don't make holes in the paper as you write and erase. I had other Sudoku books where I ended up making a copy of each page before working on it.The disappointment is that some puzzles are not properly formed, and have more than one solution."
1,Completely worthless,"This was a complete waste of my money. It was unusable. Unlike another reviewer, I was able to get it out easily enough, but I completely agree when the reviewer said, ""It was incredibly dry and flaked off. Since the directions instruct you to use a putty knife, I had expected something of putty consistency. This is more like dry, glued sawdust. This stuff is worthless."" It actually stuck to my putty knife and would not spread. Terrible! Don't buy it!"
5,Love this stuff!,"Many of my furniture projects are prefinished white shelving, assembled with small brads from an air nailer which leave tiny depressions. This product fills them easily and they disappear not needing touchup paint if you swipe across with a damp paper towel. If you are lucky enough to get fairly new product, it will come out of the tube with a little effort. Like most, what I usually end up with is older and impossible to squeeze out. Not to worry - I cut the bottom end off and squeeze it into a glass makeup jar that has an airtight lid, then use a tiny spatula to fill the nail holes. I make them out of an eye makeup sponge - just remove the sponge and you have a flexible miniature spatula :o) What I'm using right now was in my garage for 3-1/2 years. Tried the microwave trick, didn't work, neither did pliers LOL Impossible to squeeze any out at all. Once I removed it from the tube it's easy as pie to apply tiny amounts with the applicator."
1,Pure crap in a tube,"I am a professional woodworker and always looking for something new. I purchased four different ""flavors"" of this stuff in the summer of 2009 and had occasion to use it for the first time in a class I was teaching in February 2010. The stuff would hardly come out of the tube and when applied to a wood surface flaked off with the application of a little light sanding. Then the topper was that Amazon wouldn't let me return the filler unless I paid shipping and took a cut on the original price. Well I used it to ""fill"" the bottom of my trashcan. New ain't always better. Beware."
2,disappointing,"Looks cool but doesn't last long. The led gets tired quickly and dims, then burns out. Whether you take it out of the a/c socket often or don't, it dies the same. Quickly. Not worth the money in my opinion."
2,"Too many scannos, even at a good price","This review is of the Kindle edition, by Open Road. I haven't bought it, and won't, even though it's on a great sale - there are too many scannos in the Look Inside preview. This is perhaps my absolute favorite Wimsey story, but things like ""hell"" for ""bell"" would distract and annoy me far too much to make it worth my while to buy this version. Pity, I'd have loved to have this book in an e-version - guess I'll have to look elsewhere. And it's a pity this company couldn't be bothered to have a real copy-editor go through before releasing the book."
5,"One of my favorite books -- characters you love, graceful story, intriguing mystery","Probably Dorothy Sayers' best novel, considered by many to be one of the top 2-3 mystery works of all time. Beautiful writing--literature vs. simply a plot vehicle. The characters of Lord Peter Wimsey and Bunter really come alive, and you fall in love with them.Wonderful depiction of English country life, too. The solution of the mystery is original, unexpected, and completely satisfying. The final section of the book is very moving. This book is a pleasure on all levels. Those who enjoy it but have not yet read other Wimsey books may want to try Strong Poison next, as it tells the story of Lord Peter's love for Harriet Vane. That story arch eventually leads to my favorite Dorothy Sayers book, Busman's Honeymoon.No gory CSI stuff here-- just beautiful writing, thoughtful plotting, an intriguing mystery, and beloved characters whose adventures continue in other great books."
5,The Nine Tailors,"This is my favorite Dorothy Sayers novel. The characters, the art of change ringing and the mystery itself keep you reading to the end."
4,Lord Peter in Wales missing emeralds and a dead body,"This was a Lord Peter mystery and the plot was well thought out like all Dorothy Sayers. It was definitely one of the slower Lord Peter novels, and I would not recommend this for a first Dorothy Sayers Lord Peter read.If you are already a fan of the Lord Peter mysteries you will like this. It's a Sunday afternoon with a cup of tea read.Although there was a little more information about church bells than I really wanted to know."
4,The Nine Tailors,The Nine Tailors is a well written book which enravels a murder mystery in a very quiet town called East Anglia. This book is a joy to read and is one of Dorothy Sayers finest books. This book is a mus
1,I should have believed,"the very few 1-star reviews! After reading about half of this book and suffering several migraines, I have decided to end my misery! Words. More words. Many more words. Ah, a few I even recognize. A great much of to do about a great deal of nothing. My first reading from the works of this highly praised writer will be my last......and I fear that I may no longer love the sounds of bells being played."
3,Plot is better than the writing,"Writing is much better that in ""Whose Body?"" . You will learn more about bell ringing than you probably ever thought you would."
3,The Nine Tailors,"Very slow start. Not a very exciting read, but I did learn a lot about church bells and the mathematics concerning their use."
5,Unexpected,The story is not about tailors at all but about bells. No bells as we know them but a system of bell ringing quite ancient. Not music but some ancient cryptic system.Each belll has a name and no bell is alike in size or tone.The whole mystery revolves around the church bells. Everything in old England. It's totally amusing.
5,One of the great novels of the century,"It's a cliche to say that something ""transcends its genre."" However, any time I want to point to an example, I use The Nine Tailors. Sayers' best novel is far more than just a mystery novel. It is well written, with great characters, atmosphere, and a sense of place that rivals the best of Thomas Hardy. Even if you don't like mystery novels, you should read The Nine Tailors."
3,Nix the Bell Trivia,"Sayers gives you lots of detailed facts about bells and bell ringing in the novel. I found it tiresome and boring.The mystery is a good one and the ending is a complete surprise, but the bell facts really slow down the story. I skimmed through the trivia and the story was much better."
3,Tough to get past the atmosphere,"A very good mystery novel but not, in my opinion, one of Dorothy Sayers' best works. She herself admits that the mathematical complexities of church bell ringing is a very British phenomeon. For other audiences, the setting of the story can be almost intrusive and very difficult to deal with."
1,DEADLY DULLNESS,"A murder mystery? No. A complete history of English bell ringing. It would have been less painful to have my hair set on fire than to read this book. The reviewers recommend this author as comparable to Agatha Christie. They were very wrong. The author was obviously articulate, but to what end? If all you want to do is read, then reread, then reread how mathmatical bell ringing tradition is, then by all means purchase this book. If you are looking for a Christie mystery, forget it."
4,"A wonderful little ""who done it""","A wonderfully written mystery, with beautiful observations. There are some who say one of the best. For me I can not say, for I have read very few mysteries. I would not call it a page turner, but I do find it quite clever and unique. Perhaps it is because it is written in British vernaculars that makes it somewhat hard to follow.I didn't realize there was such a complex structure behind church bell ringing."
4,Classic Sayers,"I saw the old BBC version of this story years ago. The book is different, and better (aren't they all?) than the movie. Classic Wimsey, what?"
5,The Premier Mystery Story Writer of the 20th century,"Dorothy L. Sayers born 1893,published 1923,and wrote for twenty years. She was one of the first women Oxford graduates. Most of her writings were scholarly works. Murder mysteries were her avocation. As far as I am concerned there is nothing that comes close to her literary abilities. She contrived the most amazing plots that would challenge any mystery lover to solve. Gruesome she was not. Subtle, she was. Interested in opening the painful psychological problems of her characters she did not. Yes her writing could be considered dated by some; but like me I enjoyed her plot construction and wonderful writing abilities. ""The Nine Tailors"" is the best.Gwen Bohlen"
2,The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler,"I just watched the VHS version of this film, and I must say that if the quality were 20% better, it would be poor! The transfer(?) of this film is amateurish at best. It is nearly unwatchable. Showcase Productions should move out of the garage they use and actually rent a building for their film transfers. I could never recommend anyone to get this VHS cassette. The print itself is only fair to begin with, so the whole effect is terrible. The story is okay, but the transfer and film quality ruin a good premise. ATwo stars is generous, I think!"
5,Good buy,Customer reviews helped me make this my choice for sending a new TV to my Dad. He was thrilled with the quality of the picture -extremely clear- and good colors. The integrated DVD player and Video are a big plus too. Delivery was extremely fast and the product arrived in good condition.
2,"Picture and DVD work, VCR failed after 9 months","I purchased this unit about 10 months ago, and the unit worked superb for the first 9 months. Then the VCR went bananas and won't allow me to insert a VHS tape cause it ejects it automatically. The 1 year warranty only includes parts and no labor, so I don't think it is even worth repairing. I will just use my old VCR that I have had for 11 years and works great.I won't buy Magnavox again. Never, ever."
1,Not New,"This VHS was definately NOT NEW. I am aware VHS quality is somewhat less than DVD but this tape has obviously seen better days, like in a rental tape. The picture is washed out and very degraded and the sound is off in some scenes. Tried e-mailing the seller but got a reply from Amazon that their e-mail box is full or has been changed. Will go from here."
3,good movie,"I never knew this movie existed until I saw it the other day. I was surprised how good it was. It was much better than most of Air Force movies I've seen. It didn't have any of the sappy, romantic scenes in it that usually (and unbearably) bog action films down. It was pure action with an intriguing plot. This was very worthy movie!"
1,do not like it,yankees rule dont by this anyway it has bad cottton so by a yankee jerseyps this is just a fan but if it were a yankee jersey i would give it 4 stars
1,Beware! Bogus Disc,"Do not buy any jewel case version of this game. Especially the ones which say you can download a PDF version of the manual from [...]. The application thinks the disc is pirated and refuses to run. I even downloaded the latest patch. No luck. I'm not accusing anyone of piracy but something went wrong in the pressing of the CD. Also, what I got was a CD not a DVD."
4,"Very fun game, full of plot twists","The story line is a great addition to the legacy of kain series, I actually played this one first then went to soul reaver 1. It really didn't matter, I had the story down and none of the suprises in the 2nd one ruined the first.The combat is great, I love throwing spears at enemies or burning vampires after they've given me a hard time fighting them.Also there's a great deal of survival instinct in this game as you can live on a sliver of life if you are careful and still get through many bad guys as you get more accustomed to the controls.Overall, great game and very nice price for something of this quality. The graphics accent the story, which is the best part of the game, and you will love this game if you have already played soul reaver 1, or any of the Legacy of Kain series."
2,A good game considering PC has shooters and strategies ONLY,"Since there were and maybe there ARE not enough games that are NOT shooters or strategies, maybe PC gamer needs to pay attention to Soul Reaver.Why I disliked it? Because I beat first part and expected more of exploring and puzzles. Second part begins with hack and slash like action game and pathetic, boooooring dialogues. I passed few hours with Soul Reaver 2, there is great graphics and levels are eye candy, but that doesn't do it for me..."
1,Unpredictable results,We had two of these and both produced unpredictable results. The broil setting would often broil full-on or cycle off and on turning a broiling attempt into a baking. Also there is only one level to put the wire rack on so when toasting the top toasts well but the bottom is either undercooked or burned near to the heating coils. Putting an item inside with a aluminum foil cover would often make the unit cycle on and off every few seconds with annoying loud clicks probably due to the reflected heat from the foil. Cooking times became unpredictable due to the weird cycling on/off making the oven useless for following cooking times in recipes.
1,A Piece of [junk],"The only thing worse than a toaster oven that breaks after 3 months is a toaster oven that breaks the day after exchanging for a new one. In fact, the only way this shrapnel could be worse is if they painted it flourescent-green and plastered it violently with Smurf stickers. Do not buy this man! Just run away.On a positive note, if you do have one and your ""warranty"" has run out, there are some alternative uses:- Blunt weapon- Dollhouse- Cat jail- Catbox protector (The racks are practically designed for clumping cat litter).- Hamster coffin. (This is the only model reccomended for mass burials, as it is quite spacious and can accomodate double-digits).- Refridgerator- Step-ladder- Noise-maker- Dress it up as your favorite superhero and launch it down the street while reciting aloud well-known lines from that same superhero.That's all. Nothing good can come of this. Take care and always read the reviews FIRST!!!!- Lester"
2,Unacceptable sound quality,"These sopranos are very accomplished. Lily Pons is a particular favourite of mine. I think Janini Micheau is worthy of more than the two tracks she's been given on this disc. Mado Robin's upper range is quite exceptional, but the recordings on this dicc (made in 1942 and 1947) are so of such poor quality as to be unlistenable. This spoils an otherwise excellent CD."
4,Filled with good ideas and great photos.,"This title by Better Homes and Gardens editors really helped me in planning two built in storage projects.The book is organized by type of rooms with sections on: Living & Dining Rms; Kitchens, Bed & Bath Rms; Home Office.The book is not a how-to so it really just gives you ideas but there are plenty of ideas and some practical helpful tips.I've read 3-4 of the Storage Idea books and think this is the best of the ones I've seen because it has an excellent variety of types and styles. Also the photography is better than most."
1,Not what I expected,"I thought this would be a book on novel ways to stash your stuff. It was... but I was looking for ideas on cool containers and other low-budget ways to fit more storage space in my one-bedroom apartment. It instead is a book on good ideas (with great photos) if you're already tearing out a wall in your house, as in great for long term construction plans, but not so helpful for those with a more transient, non-house-owning lifestyle. If I had my own house, I would have given 4 stars. Apartment dwellers, look elsewhere."
2,Not so original..,"When I first bought this book, I was hoping to find new ideas for my new walk-in closet.. unfortunately the book wasn't all that.. It didn't seem to have ""301"" ideas.. all it seemed to show are normal photos of everyday closets and storage places..I personally do not recommend it.."
3,book,had a few good ideas but most were not practical for my home - kept in my library for reference
3,NOT ENOUGH IDEAS,"FIRST THE BOOK CAME IN GOOD CONDITION JUST LIKE THE SELLER SAID, SO I WAS GLAD. I TORN OUT THE PAGES I LIKED AND PUT THEM IN A SCRAP BOOK, WHICH WAS A FEW. THE BOOK LACKED HOW TO FIND OTHER CREATIVE USES FOR STORAGING BESIDES THE USUAL BIG BOX CONTAINERS THAT COME IN VARIOUS COLORS AND THERE ARE BOOK SHELFS THAT ARE MADE FOR THEM. LIKE IN A CHILD'S PLAYROOM. I WAS EXPECTING MORE IDEAS. UNLESS YOU ARE A CARPENTOR IT DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TO OFFER FOR ME. NOT SURE WHAT I EXPECTED BUT I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED."
4,Need Ice,"This is a cool item to own. If you are looking for something to help start your summer off right, well this is it. It was made for crushing ice just right for those speciality drinks. Get one and enjoy!"
5,Buy This Book,"This is an honest, deep, and well footnoted description of why the Middle East and China did not develop the full power of science, philosophy and technology for the full service of mankind like Western Europe did. I read the book as part of my on-going effort to understand what drives Middle Easterners to act the way they do on the World Stage. I learned that after about 1200 AD, Middle Eastern Islamic scholarly denial of the concept of cause and effect made and makes the scientific method null and void for the people of the Middle East. This prevents them from creating for themselves the body and soul enriching fruits of advanced science, philosophy and technology. For reasons predating the Renaissance, Europe had and has no such fear of accepting the scientific method. This includes accepting critical examination of the historical accuracy of Holy Scripture, and also learning in exquisite detail how God runs His Universe. I'm now reading in the book about China."
3,They need to reengineer,"I love beeswax candles so when I saw that UCO was making them for their candle lanterns I was so excited!While these work ok, I think they're maybe using the wrong wick size. The candle I have been using burns unevenly to the point it starts to burn over the rim of the holder. Also, you need to trim these to keep the wick down where the white candles don't really need this.On the plus side they are more enviromentally sound and have a lovely aroma.If UCO would work on the wick and burning issue, then they would have a great product. I think they used the same molds and wicks as the their traditional white candles completely ignoring the fact that beeswax burns differently and needs to be managed accordingly.They really need to team up with Blue Corn Candles (who specializes in beeswax) and make a superior product. I would gladly pay the $10+ for these if they were as efficient as the their traditional white candles."
4,Last long time,"I've used the paraffin candles for years and they work great. Just enough light to keep the evening pleasant. The beeswax version lasts quite a bit longer, 12+ hours, but is not quite as bright. Also, the mice like these so keep that in mind for storage both in the field and at home."
1,Clean up,I purchased the Beeswax candles because of the longer burning time. When the candle burned down and I started to replace it I found the the inside of the UCO Candle Lantern was totally fouled up with the bees wax. It took me almost an hour the get all of the wax out of the lantern. I will not put another bees wax candle in my lantern. I burned one without the lantern and was very disapointed. It gave out very little light and now I have to clean up the stickey wax out of and off of my candle holder.How do I give it a 1/2 star?
5,Beeswax Candles,"In an effort to get a better candle i have switched to natural beeswax candles. I am not using these for lanterns, they are in wall sconces in my foyer. They do have a long shelf life, i haven't measured if its 12hrs or not but i still have the same boxes i originally ordered and haven't replaced the ones in my scones yet."
5,For Emergencies,Good to keep on hand for lights out time when there is a storm or power failure for whatever reason. Beeswax purns much slower than regular wax.
2,Don't work as well as the 9 hour Paraffin candles,I bought these for the longer burn time but unfortunately they don't seem to feed up through the candle tube very well. You end up with a very small flame that can go out very easily. I can open up the candle and manually push it up the tube to get a nice large flame again but that pretty much negates one of the major benefits of having the UCO lantern in the first place. If I am doing something wrong and there is a better way to have these work correctly please let me know because I like the smell of these and prefer a longer burn time. In the mean time I will go back to the 9 hour paraffin candles because those work great and feed up through the tube fine and so maintain a nice large flame.
4,Who can resist a knight on a motorcycle?,"Jane Sullivan's latest is hard to put down until the end.The hero is all that his name suggests.""Wolfe""is strong, a loner, cautious and protective. Although he may intimidate others with his size and scarred face and his gruff demeanor there is an immediate attraction when he comes to Wendy's rescue.Wolfe is completely overwhelmed by Wendy's beauty but also her enthusiasm, determination and fearlessness.She has a dream and intends to persue it despite the odds.He is the gentle giant who doesn't think he could be loved by a beautiful princess...but she is exactly what he needs and he is everything she wants.Whether she is writing as Jane Sullivan or Jane Graves, Jane always delivers a sexy, witty, quick moving story with characters that stay with you long after you close the book."
4,Fun Reading,I enjoyed this book very much. The characters were likable and I enjoyed the humor. I would recommend this book and I will definately read more Jane Sullivan.
3,"something that one can listen to, and not get annoyed","Hey! A couple of years ago, when I visited relatives in Sweden, I got to listen to this cd a lot while in the car. The songs I remember the most are Come Along and 1989. I can't remember the rest very well, but I am sure that they were ok as well. (So, I don't know what to rate it- 3 is the middle, so don't get mad!)This is a great one to introduce to a little one, rather than Britney Spears' music."
4,"""Come Along"" is a must have CD","Titiyo's new CD ""Come Along"" does everything right. Smoother than Vonda Shepard voice, so much groove it's beyond soft-rock or soul. Deep lyrics and tunes you'll croon in the shower. You'll keep this CD on repeat for days."
2,Doctors writing for nurses,"I was looking for a practical guide to school nursing, to helpease my transition from hospital practice to community health. Thisbook is fine for the school nurse who is starting a clinic literallyfrom the ground up. It even has floor plans for school clinics. The assumption is that the schools have unlimited funds, large space and unlimited time to provide healthcare, and the focus is very administrative. Treatment of everyday shcool nursing issues is very cursory. The extensive treatment of sexual-orientation issues renders the book very suspect--there is an agenda here. There are lots of reproducible forms which can be useful. However, the fact that this book was written by an MD should have been a red flag: Not for nurses who live in the real world and need practical advice. END"
3,Flawed but nice,"This is a live recording of a Kenton concert made in Manchester, England in 1963. The Mellophonium band was a splendid organization, and it is here heard playing an unusually varied program, from dance tunes to vocals to the celebrated Cuban Fire Medley. Unfortunately the sound is poor. The Kenton brass men sound as though they are playing next door. Vocalist Jean Turner, the band's last touring singer, is just average. Kenton sax soloists Gabe Baltazar and Steve Marcus, on the other hand, are excellent.I would rate this the least of the normally excellent Astral Jazz CDs of the Kenton band."
4,"High quality, will soften?","These are very high quality sheets for the price. Nice thread count, but the only complaint I have is that the jaquard pattern kind of makes them scratchy. I have only washed them once, but I'm pretty confident they will soften with age. Otherwise, the come out the dryer nicely and keep their shape well."
2,not what i expected,"I bought this to wear with a pendant however the chain would not fit through the bail as it was to thick, i had to send it back but i got a prompt refund!"
2,Not An Exact Replacement,"These are supposed to be a replacement for the iPAQR1950 stylus. Well, they are close, but not exact. They do not fit snug in the stylus channel. When the iPAQ is inverted, they fall out. Yes, it's a stylus and yes it works, but it is a pain the the neck."
2,Cute but taste of plastic in water,"I bought this for my mom after viewing it on Amazon together, thinking that it is a trusted name brand (Black and Decker)and it looked really cute, and had a great review. But, after using it, realized that it wasn't as good as we thought. The plastic looked cheaper than some other brands, which verified why there was a plastic smell and taste in the water (this would be my main concern in purchasing an electric kettle). My mom didn't want to deal with all the trouble of returning it. She's hoping that the taste and smell of plastic would eventually go away (which I doubt). I would recommend a similar style (in white) from [brand name] that I currently own. It is great! Buy the right one the first time around, instead of regreting it afterwards."
2,Great - while it lasted........,"I loved this electric kettle when I first got it. Looks stylish, heats water relatively fast, easy to use, etc. But it recently went kaput, after about a year. The connection started to be on sometimes, off sometimes, and now just OFF.For what I paid it should last longer than that. Very disappointed in the quality. I will definitely buy another kettle, but not a black and decker."
4,Moody character study,"The stranger in this German flick is an American actor who speaks decent German. He woos a 13-year-old girl, then woos her boyfriend's mother in a love triangle that goes awry. Beautifully shot in the German countryside, this film is a lean examination of motives and intents and what happens when expectations are not met. Way better than the average Hollywood adult melodrama."
4,"Cool, like futuristic detective stories.","Gil ""the arm"" Hamilton, named so because of his prosthetic arm, and the strange telekinetic ability he has that was developed after he lost his real arm and before the replacement, is a detective for ARM, the United Nations police force. The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton is a few stories of deduction and logic involving weird technologies, monstrous crimes as well as equally monstrous punishments in a world obsessed with staying young at the expense of everyone else. Very cool addendum to the Known Space Series."
2,This work is really just a preface for a book on the subject,"(...)I found nothing compelling in the 51 pages of this book, no photos, no new bibliographic finds, no unusual insights, the footnotes are not bad. I was very disappointed in this work, and very happy I bought it at Amazon, where I didn't have to get angry at myself for paying full price for a book that may not even go in my library!Yes, it is ""concise""... 'nuff said!Give this a miss and invest your research dollars elsewhere!"
3,Smaller than I expected,It's a bit small so the sand goes through so fast it's hard to watch. However it's well made and sturdy.
4,Good toy,"This is a well built toy that is a good choice for children 1 1/2 to 3 years old. It can be used with sand, water, or other materials (I even used rice). Children enjoy watching the wheel spin as they pour materials into the funnel. It is a good toy for the money invested."
2,The Palestinians are supposedly always victims,"This video is embarrassingly biased. The makers of ""People and the Land"" are intellectually trapped by their leftist doctrines. They fail to see the proverbial forest because the trees are in the way. The world is perceived as split between the oppressors and their victims. Israel is an alleged fascist state taking advantage of the Palestinians. The Israelis are always at fault. Absurdly, no mention is made of Palestinian terrorism as the reason for ambulance searches and troop checkpoints.Jew hatred is number one reason for the trouble in this region. The Palestinians are often nothing less than self pitying thugs enraged and embittered by their second class status---which is the fault of their own foolish choices and racist bigotry.David ThomsonFlares into Darkness"
2,Not worth it,"I've had this device for over a year - in fact, I have 4 in my 1 bedroom apt. (1 in kitchen, 2 living room / bedroom, 1 in other bedroom) In sum, it's mildly effective with roaches and not effective with mice at all. I wouldn't waste my money on this if I were you, am sure you can find something better."
1,Not To Fond Of The Idea,As a person who really doesn't like spiders i would love to find something to rid them of my house and not need to worry about them anymore but in this house hold we also have pet rats. There needs to be something for just bugs because rats/mice can also be pets aswell and i wouldn't want to harm them!
2,popular film in tunisia,"this is not a movie with the polish and complexity of other north african directors whose movies are available at amazon.com or amazon.fr such as nadir mokneche (algeria), laila marrakchi (morocco) or ferid boughedir (tunisia). in an interview, included as an extra, the director nouri bouzid enjoying his success and a beer, talks proudly and engagingly about how well-received the film has been in his home country, tunisia. perhaps it is best to regard the film in that context: an easy-to-follow movie for wide distribution. why then the international awards? bouzid talks of the film's conception in political (anti-terrorist) terms, and the awards are his reward...even the lead actor, who is totally wooden, has won some prize or other. it is no better nor worse than bouzid's other films."
1,battery charge doesn't last long,I've converted back to regular batteries - the rechargeables never seemed to keep a long charge and just became too frustrating never knowing if I was going to have my camera die in the middle of a tour.
1,Charger Doesn't Work,"After following instructions to the letter, I plugged in the unit to the outlet on the wall; after a week, the green ""Charged"" light never came on."
1,Save your money,I bought these to use with my new camera. After charging the batteries they don't last more than 15 minutes (fully charged). I don't understand why Amazon recommends the bundle. Stay away from this product!
1,Not for Christmas,"I ordered this item Nov 16, 2007. On Nov 22 this item now shows on my ordering tracking page as not being delivered until after Dec 25. No notice from Amazon."
5,A RETURNED ITEM...DIDNT NEED IT!,I PURCHASE THIS ITEMS WHICH I RETURNED AS I FOUND OUT THAT I HAVE FEW TOOO MANY THAT DOES THE EXACT SAME THING SO I RETURNED IT BUT I'M SURE IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT IF YOU REALLY NEED IT...I RECOMMEND IT! ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A TRAVELER AND CONSTANTLY TAKING PICS! BUT AGAIN THE ITEM WAS RETURNED AND I DIDNT REALLY NEED THE EXTRA!I DIDNT GET A CHANCE TO USE IT!
2,Was defective out of the box. Only one side charges 2 batteries.,"On first usage, I noticed the next morning that only one pair of batteries showed a green light. I tested all four and it seemed like they were all charged, but the charge didn't hold when I tried to use them in my camera about a week later. Nimh batteries are supposed to keep their charge much longer. I got this at special pricing (around $6 or $7) due to my camera purchase, so I didn't bother sending it back at any additional cost."
3,Battery Charge,"This was a add on to the camera I bought, the charger is easy to use and handle and already saved me batteries twice so far. I think this was a great packaging idea. Kudos to them. I would tell anyone who is buying a camera or other item that uses lots and lots of batteries that this is just great idea to save money while having charged batteries on hand at all times."
4,Camera battery charger,The DPS-3000 Rechargeable battery kit is a good match for the Canon A640 camera.
3,It's working just fine.,"Looking over the reviews for this product makes one believe that two different products were reviewed, one that worked fine and another that was terrible. I am having none of the problems from the negative reviews. My batteries are charging fine and there is no overheating. My guess is the problems came from an earlier version of the product.4-12-2010 - Still working fine. I bought two more sets.6-14-2010 - About the life of the batteries. I found that the batteries are lasting only about 3 hours of use in a point and shoot camera (with the camera set to use this type of battery). Initially they lasted long enough that I didn't notice the life of the charge, but with a fresh charge I get an afternoon of shots before I get a low battery warning. These batteries are about six months old."
1,Stopped working after using twice,The charge light would not come on after second use.I tried the digipowersolutions web site listed on the package.Got a warning that it was a bad web site regarding privacy and vendor reliability.It's so cheap it isn't worth shipping it back.Don't buy this piece of junk.
5,DigiPower DPS-3000+ 3-Hour AA/AAA Rechargeable Battery Kit,Wit all the battery hungry cameras this item is a must have. A lot less expensive in the long run than buying alkaline batteries every time you turn around. Come with car charger also.
2,Rechargeable batteries,"I bought these for use in a camera. After a short time I went back to using alkaline batteries due to the short battery life.Pro's: Batteries are rechargeble, multiple times...Con's: Batteries don't hold a charge for very long...They don't last. They let me down at the wrong time for me."
3,seems to function ok,purchased this unit for a new Camera that likes to 'eat' batteries - this unit seems to keep it fed.
3,overall good but won't charge 4,"I have had this for more than a year and am still using the batteries that came with it and using it to charge other brand batteries also. The only problem is that it never would charge 4 batteries. The 2 battery slots on the right side did not work since new, so I can only charge 2 batteries at one time. You can charge AA or AAA bateries. The charging indicator is good and lets you know when the batteries are charging and have charged."
1,The rechargeable batteries do not work for my camera,"I bought the product for my new Camera - Canon Powershot SX20 IS. It was advertised along side with the Camera in Amazon website. So I thought they are the right AA battery for my camera, which uses AA. When I used them in my camera the other day, the camera did not turn on. Then to my surprise, I found the rechargeable AA batteries that came with this product have 1.2V votage instead of a standard AA battery, which has 1.5V. I felt cheated, and do not know how to return the product to the vendor for a refund. Any one has any advice?"
2,charges fast but discharges faster,"the charger looks and functions good but the batteries are dont seem to be 2700mh,even when they're not used they lose charge .I am actually planning to return it.I used kodak 2000mh before and they used to last much longer.I haven't tried other model batteries so far so dont know if it's the batteries or the charger.."
2,weak charger or batteries,The included batteries were already drained when I put them in my camera after charging them for 24 hours!
4,Good Value,"I got this for charging both AA and AAA batteries for my digital camera and Mp3 player. It has lived up to my expectations. The batteries charge relatively quickly and the lights inform me of when it is done. The only complaints I have are that the charger gets really hot while charging, which concerns me somewhat, and that the unit itself looks cheap. I also wish that the plug in had fold down progs like most portable devices have these days. That would be a big plus for travel."
2,Don't waste your money,This battery charger is poorly constructed and (mine) does not work as advertised. It has a switch that will supposedly allow you to charge two or four batteries at a time but mine will only charge four. The two battery function does not work. The only reason I am keeping this is because of the car charging function which is why I am giving it two stars and not one.
3,Good Charger but bad batteries,"The charger is very quick to charge the battery, but the battery does not last game I expected in a year and stopped working. Buy a Sony Cycle Energy batteries with which I'm using the charger and it works great."
1,Terrible product - stay away from it,I bought one of those kits bundled with my new Flip camcorder and the batteries don't last more than 15 minutes (fully charged). I don't understand why Amazon recommends the bundle. My final opinion: stay away from this product!
1,Get another brand,"The construction of the charger allows it to lose connection with the batteries= no charge. It overcharged/heated the included batteries to over 140F- I couldn't even handle them bare handed. It is, in my opinion, a piece of junk. I would not buy one of these... I should've listened to the other reviews."
3,Digi Power DPS3000,"I uses these batteries and chargers for 18 months. they were very good batteries, long charges, easy recharges. Can be charged in the car. Nice touch.Unfortunately they don't outlast eveready, they're still going strong. But 18 months isn't bad for about 16 bucks."
2,An OK charger,"The batteries it shipped with lost their ability to charge in about two charges. The charger itself is OK, but nothing special"
2,"Leaked, Dont buy","Bought these for an RC car, after about 4 days 2 of them started leaking, Through all 4 out. Not worth the risk in my opinion."
3,Product Description wrong,The charger I recieved does not include a 120-volt AC cord as advertised in the Product Description . Instead it has a fold out power connector. I am a disappointed that it was misrepresented and not what I expected.
4,Rechargeable AA batteries,"This was my first purchase of rechargeable AA batteries and I am completely satisfied to date. I haven't used the camera long enough to find out how long the battery life lasts, but so far so good!"
5,Just What I Need!!!,I always need AA batteries and never have any. This is perfect. The Batteries last longer than the originals. They are perfect for when the TV remote runs out of battery or when the kids video game controlers do.
2,Not as expected,These socks were purchased for my husband who has MS and experiences coldness in his feet. The socks barely warm and the shank of the sock is so tight that they are uncomfortable to put on and take off--and my husband is thin. The manufacturer also said that they are not returnable. This is something I did not know until too late.
1,Very Poor Performance,"No wonder these socks are always on ""SALE!"" I bought a pair to use while skiing. The first time I used them, it took about 30 minutes to feel any heat at all, and it was just barely noticable. The second and third times I tried them, there was no heat at all (with new batteries). The weight of the batteries and the location of the battery pouches guarantees that the socks will not stay up, but will bang against your ankles or lower legs as you walk (or ski). Part of the poor heat problem, I think, is the poorly designed battery connectors which don't make good contact with the positive end of the battery. Don't waste your money."
1,Works the same with or without batteries.,"After reading the scores of negative reviews and my own experience with this product, I am amazed that they're still on the market. I wish I would've read some of these reviews before I plunked down $25 on these lemons. The heat output is almost nonexistent despite using huge, heavy ""D"" cells and a large, uncomfortable heating element. The company recommends periodically removing the battery to avoid overheating your feet, which would be good advice provided you're using them in the tropics."
2,nordic gear battery heated lectra sox,"my daughter bought me these socks, and I have worn them for the first time today. After taking them from the box and putting them on -they were uncomfortable you can feel the wires and mine dont work even though the batteries are brand new. very disapointing"
3,"Don't stay up, minimal heat","These socks generate no perceptible ""heat"" per se, but they do something to take the chill off ones feet. The texture of the heating wires, as others commented, are noticeable, but not a problem for me. I use them mostly seated, while flying a small plane with inadequate heat for night flights in cold weather, and think the chemical pack solution is as good or better -- and surely less expensive (particularly considering battery cost). I found that they slip down my legs due to battery weight, and I do better wearing them with tall boots so keep the socks in place.The socks themeselves are comfortable and warm, and they look like they will hold up to several washings. So, I'll use these again, but I would not buy them if I was making the decision again."
1,They didn't work.,The Lectra Sox either didn't work as advertized. Only the slightest amount of warmth could be felt. What a waste of money
2,Poor performance,The socks did not warm my feet and only when worn for hours did I feel any heat from the heating elements
1,Battery life is terrible!,"I ordered these and sent them straight back. I didnt try them on or turn them on. Was not listed in the product info on Amazon about the battery life. When I got the box I read on the packaging that they require 1 D battery each sock, and the battery life is UP to 6hrs per battery , or 2-3hrs using rechargeable batteries. I wanted socks that I could use daily for a whole day skiing- this would mean I would get through 2 D batterys per day and still only have a short day of warmth.I have no idea how warm they get but the wire for heating is only in the toe.Disappointed with Nordic."
3,"Look ok , never used them yet","I can't give an honest rating yet, because I never used them, but they look ok and they heat up"
1,They don't work,"They just don't work. I brought these to Wisconsin, it was 4degrees outside, I put new batteries in, I did not feel any heat, maybe in a little warmer setting it would be noticeable. But if it was warmer you wouldn't need them...."
5,Warm toes,"Well, who knew that a D-cell battery would have a enough juice to heat your feet. They do not over heat your feet, just the right amount of heat to keep them warm. Good for sitting in the bush, waiting for the right beast to cross your path. A little costly but, well worth it. It is a nice product and the wool of the socks are comfy. I would buy another pair if these ones wore out."
3,Indirect & Realiant on 3rd party products.,"I purchased this book with the intention of learning how to communicate with USB peripherals from the PC perspective. What I later found after reading this book is that the author is heavily reliant upon 3rd party products to do the work, which simply means you'll need to pay more money for evaluation modules, and more software rather than being able to make the end product yourself. For someone who is at the hobbiest level, this book would be great perhapse, but the ultimate problem is it lets others do the work which IMO defeats the purpose of a book. If I am going to use 3rd party tools, I'll read their documentation-- not pay for a book to tell me what else I need to use.On another note, this book is an EXCELLENT reference book when you need a little refresher about other things, but you can also find this info online"
2,USB Complete or is it?,"The author does a great job reviewing the details of USB. However, if your intentions are like mine to design some hardware and transfer data from the device to the PC, I think your pretty much out of luck.I understand this is a very hard subject but the author does not include sample drivers that allow you to communicate with a generic part, let alone, helping you develop a driver for your application.I think this book is only good to get a sense only for what USB is and how it works. Unfortunately, blocks diagrams do not solve anyones problem, and knowledge-hungry individuals such as myself find these books rather useless. Buy the book only if you have no clue what USB is, else do not waste your money."
5,"Excellent for hardware, firmware, and software developers","With the help of this book, I went from knowing virtually nothing about USB to having a device programmed and communicating with a PC. The book covers everything from what's important to know in the USB specification, to selecting a controller chip for a device, to writing the device firmware and application programs to communicate with the device. About the only area not covered is how to write a Windows device driver (this is probably a book-length topic in itself), but Jan explains why this is often not necessary and describes tools that make the job easier when needed. Highly recommended"
3,another alternative: www.ftdi.co.uk,"i've incorporated usb to my applications by using ftdi's royalty-free solution...The chip is a usb-to-serial convertor, appearing as a virtual comport on the pc, OR through the use of direct drivers enables the chip to be recognized as s true usb device. its probably the most painless way to quickly get usb on your device, but FTDI has yet to get their XP drivers digitally signed."
3,Excellent Tutorial & Reference,"A lot of detailed information about USB is presented logically and gradiently. This book serves as an excellent USB tutorial and reference. It is a must have for the serious USB developer.P.S. I selected a 5 star rating, not sure why 3 stars are showing."
4,An excellent book on USB communications,"There are not many books that cover USB communications in detail as is done in this book. However, there are still many aspects of USB that are not completely covered in this book. My main criticism is that it can have more code examples covering different USB micro controllers, like those made by Atmel. Still, I would be nowhere today with this difficult topic if I did not have this book. Excellent work Mr Axelson, thanks!"
4,"First Look, Windows Centric, but a Good Reference","I pre-ordered this book, and it just arrived about an hour ago, so keep in mind that this is more of a ""first impression"" than a deep review. Ms. Axelson sets the bar very high with the title theme of her books, i.e. ""Complete"". Some come closer than others to this laudable goal, but I'm not sure if any of them quite reach that high bar. On a quick look, my biggest issue with this book is that it is Windows-centric. I don't see how you can call it complete without addressing Linux and Mac OSX. If you are only working with the Windows environment, then this is no doubt a very useful reference. If, like me, you only rarely work in the Windows environment, I think this book is still worth having, but keep in mind that you probably won't find anything here to address matters specific to your OS."
5,"A little scattered, but much LESS THAN THE USB SPEC","This is probably a harware designer's book. If you ever plan on designing or undestanding USB hardware, this is definitely (no matter what cost), the book for you. Jan Axelson has written for many EE mags, and knows what she is talking about. The book may be getting dated, as a few of the chips she descibes are obsolete, but who cares - the data is relevant. Very well done, and very readable."
3,= * * *,"I would say this book is about 1/4 very general information, 1/4 Windows specific stuff, 1/4 hardware level stuff, and 1/4 USB protocol stuff. There is about 400 pages of content (big font), so each of those is about 100 pages.I personally was not looking for Windows specific stuff or hardware level stuff, and the general stuff was too general to be of interest to me.So only about 1/4 of the book had information of value to me. That 1/4 was pretty good, but nothing special... ok it was special in the sense that I have not seen any other books right now even trying to provide the same information, and I find the USB specs excessively arcane/byzantine."
2,not a good introductory book,I'm a system control design engineer. I've used Axelson's serial port book and parallel port book and I didn't have any problem with them and used them a lot in my job. But this USB book is page after page of code and I can't find anything concrete to start with like a project using some eval board. I think if you've already designed a working USB system then you would probably find a lot of useful information in this book but I had to send it back because I'm trying to put together my first USB connection and I don't have a clue how to do it using this book.
3,USB Incomplete,"This book..... I dont know.There's a lot of good tricks to learn from this book.Its good for getting the jist of USB programming.But some of the code samples dont work. And the example programs onthe accompanying web site dont help much.I've had this book for a month or so, and was not able to complete aworking project.Some of the code samples just DONT WORK.But there were a couple of good tricks to learn from though.Should you buy it? Only if you have money to spare."
3,A good start but not for those designing in the Linux environmen,"I incorporating USB in a vhdl design on an embedded Linux platform and needed something to get me quickly up to speed. This book served that purpose but not much help beyond. FYI, the other book by Intel press is focused on the EZ-USB product from cypress and is only marginally better."
1,What is USB,"After reading this book, USB is still a mystery.USB was not explained in detail and there did not seem any logical organization.The chapters on writing machine code were bizarre since this had minimal relevance to USB.A top-down approach starting with an overview or a bottom-up appproach starting from the hardware would have been better.Overall, this book does not really touch on the issues of USB and one wonders whether the author has a good grasp of the fundamentals of USB."
2,"Hmm, I'm not quite sure about this book...","I can't quite put my finger on WHY. All I know is that I DIDN'T like this book at all.This is one of those books that has a lot of ""filler"" material. You know, historical, or arcane information - of absolutely no use to the subject at hand: but it does make the book look bigger.Also, I thought it was too technical. Admittedly, there is not too much information available about USB. Fortunately nowadays - you can just go out and purchase a ready made solution; anything not to have to wade through this book..."
5,Excellent book,"This book really explains USB in detail, and Jan Axelson seems to really know what he is talking about. I am impressed."
4,get to know Keith,"I am a big stones fan , and Keith Richards fan. I like how this book is layed out. You can pick it up and read inany chapter and know what was going on in that time frame . BUY IT"
3,r,was not what i wanted to read due to language i give the book away. i should not have order the book.
5,The true bad boy of Rock'n'Roll,"Keith is a legend, but it might not always be for the right reasons. Of course he is the main engine that fuels the Rolling Stones machine, but once you read this book, you get to see the other reasons that have made him a well known icon. This man helped write the songs for a generation, and we are able to get an insight into the man in this biography. We cam see into his childhood, that first meeting with the man he would ultimately become famous with, Mick Jagger, to his decade long struggle with drug use and abuse. This guy defines rock and if you like the Stones, you need to read this book and get an insight in the man behind the band"
4,Definately WITHOUT WARNING!!,I thought this cd was well put together. The beats were slammin' and the lyrics were hittin'! Such raw talent coming from such young talent out here to prove he can make it in a man's world by holdin' his own. Tracks 4 & 10 introduces Key-lo who comes off very hard and strong with his message. I look forward to projects from him which are sure to follow this release no doubt!
3,Great CD average beats,"This cd overall was great,this cat used to live in Oakland California before he moved to N/A .He is not an east coast artist .Go to his official site it says where he was from and everything,Check it out.Well anyways this albums off da hook lyrics but gots weak ... beats."
1,"Jake and the Neverland pirate DVD - only comes with the DVD, not bonus items as stAted.","I order from Amazon all the time and never have a problem. This time though, it was different. I was disappointed to learn that the Jake and the Neverland Pirate DVD I bought did not include what was stated on the actual DVD box and the description that Amazon stated. The DVD did not come with the bonus disc which was music or the pirate eye patch as stated on the box. Disappointed with this purchase. The DVD itself was in perfect condition and arrived on time."
1,Not as advertised,"Amazon advertised it came with a bonus music cd and eye patch (the box even said so) but it didnt come with either one. It was just the DVD. The whole reason I bought this was for the CD.update: Amazon did offer me 20% off the purchase price. That's not really what I wanted, but it was acceptable. They also said they are reviewing the listing to try and correct the issue/description."
1,dissapointed,"Listed in the original description, it said this item was advd 2 pack which included the dvd plus music CD and eye patch. Upon arrival these things are also listed on the case so I removed it directly from the shipping envelope and wrapped it as a Christmas gift for my son, assuming it was complete. Much to many surprise, on Christmas morning my son opened his video to find it missing the CD and eyepatch. I for one was upset but I also couldn't tell my 2 1/2 old on Christmas that because amazon screwed up he couldn't open and watch his gift so I got stuck with an overpriced dvd and nothing else."
2,Missing CD and Eye patch,"I purchased this DVD/CD combo set on December 3, 2012. When we received it, the CD was missing as was the eye patch. I notified Amazon, returned it, and received a replacement on December 5th. Of course, the replacement arrived the exact same way, with no CD or eye patch! So, I got a hold of a rep on the phone and she advised me to return it for a refund and she would flag the item on the site. I noticed that it was flagged for a few weeks, but now the flag has been removed and people are still complaining of the same issue. You will not get what is described here, you will only get the DVD. FYI, I finally went to Wal-Mart to purchase this same set and the exact same thing happened. The case is labeled as a ""combo pack"" and clearly states that it includes a CD, but there was no CD in the case. I emailed Disney about the issue, but have never heard back."
5,My daughter LOVES Jake and the Neverland Pirates!,"My daughter will be three in a week and LOVES this show to death. We have even had to DVR each episode so we can watch it together and learn everything on the show. She was able to see the show that these characters are in at Disney World a month ago and was able to sing along, cheer, and interact with the stage show because of this. I couldn't recommend it more to parents of young children!"
4,Missing disc.,If you recive and dvd with a miss disc and eye patch you can call Disney Consumer Relations at 1-800-723-4763 and they will mail you the missing items.
2,Missing part of the product listed as included,"When we opened the the package it had the dvd, but no cd or eye patch as the package indicated. I'm returning it considering it was incomplete. From a flag on amazon at this time, it appears they were alerted to the problem and will probably be fixing the issue. I wasn't alerted to the problem by amazon and had to find the flag myself (that was not there when I purchased it). Not a big deal, but a little annoying."
1,Disappointed in false advertising,"My daughter received this video as a Christmas present. She loves the videos and we thought that the CD would also grab her attention. When she opened it up, the DVD was fine, but there wasn't a second CD to complete the ""+ CD Combo"". As stated in previous reviews, the case wasn't even made to accomodate two discs, so I don't know how it could be anything other than false advertising."
3,DVD only! NOT 2 DISC COMBO PACK! No CD or eye patch!,I was EXTREMELY excited to get this DVD for my nephew. He loves watching them as do I. When it came he read (off the shrink wrapped DVD case) it came with a music cd and eye patch and was very disappointed when we opened it and it was the only DVD.I a very unimpressed and I feel cheated on this purchase.
3,Great show for kids; packaging is incorrect and the CD is missing,"My 4 year old son loves this DVD, which we received as a gift. After he started singing the songs, I looked for the CD that was supposed to be included in the 2-disc set. As may oher reviewers have stated, it was missing. I contacted Amazon Customer Service, but they seem unable to do anything about it. We are very disappointed. Amazon needs to either remove this listing or change the description."
1,MANUFACTURING DEFECT,"I sent back the first one only to receive the replacement to find parts missing inside the package again. Surely not Amazon's fault, but do not buy this. Obviously, they are all packaged the same way. It should have a DVD, CD, and eye patch. Missing DVD and eye patch. Too much aggravation for such a simple thing. All should have been removed from inventory as soon as the problem arose. They just keep shipping out the product that is incomplete!!"
3,Jake DVD,I ordered 2 of these for my grandsons. The description said it came with a music CD and an eye patch. All that came with it was the DVD which they both have enjoyed but I was very disappointed that it didn't contain what I thought I was paying for.
4,Good Values in a Fun Format,"The story line and music are fun for kids; even our almost-18-month-old granddaughter can't resist dancing to the tunes. The lessons taught by the young pirates (doing what's right, cooperation, kindness) are the kinds of messages we are glad our little ones are learning when they're enjoying these tales. The package said it included a music CD and a pirate eye patch, but we didn't receive either. That's why I only rated this 4 stars."
2,Not so Great product,"The photo here is thicker than the actual item. IT's not as beautiful as I expected. Top of it, they charge for shipping as well. So, not so happy with this purchase."
1,Doesn't matter how well it blends if it leaks!!,Very disappointed in Black and Decker products. The latest is this blender. It was replaced once under warranty due to leaking. The replacement was fine for approximately 1-1/2 years and now leaks from the bottom unbelievably. All parts are tightened properly before attaching to the blender. The motor also labors hard. Consumer Reports is wrong on this one!
2,You get what you pay for,Did well while it lasted but died after 2 years of occasional use. Simply not though enought if you needed it to deal with ice.
1,Don't waste your money!,Two big complaints:1. The blade sucks - gets cracked and twisted in no time2. There's this smell of burning plastic when I run it for more than ~10-15 seconds. I doubt this is normal.
1,Don't buy this!,"Within two months of purchase and very liitle use the Black & Decker BL600B blender started to emit a burning smell and smoke began to appear. It was unuseable at this point, I would not recommend it at all."
5,Excellent Product,"When I was looking for a blender, I found this one on Amazon. The price was right at only $30, and after reading a lot of the reviews, it seemed like a very good product. Some of the reviews wre also negative, and they made me a little skeptical, but after I got my blender, all my doubts when away. I haven't experienced any of the problems mentioned by those who left negative feedback, and this blender continues to serve me well."
1,Disappointment with Black & Decker,"I got this blender some months ago from Amazon.com. It worked for just a few times and then stopped. Because it was still in guarantee time, I called Black & Decker customer service and they asked me to cut the cord, send to them together with [$$$] check. I followed their instruction and waiting for 2 months but still receive nothing from them though they already cashed my check. After several calls with them and listening to their lies, they told me to go to report to police about the lost of the blender ! How stupid and careless Black & Decker is ! I swear to God that I never use Black Decker again !"
1,Find Another Blender - Not This One,"The Black and Decker Company Should be ashamed of having their name on this blender. After sitting unused for over 2 years, we got it out when our KitchenAid blender failed. It worked the first time, but the second time we tried to use it, it was completely dead. Of course, it's well over the warranty period. If there are still any of them out there for sale, please strongly consider not purchasing one."
2,Avoid this blender,"The reason I bought this blender is because it was a good price and a name brand.From the first time I plugged it in, I could smell burning rubber every time it ran, regardless of what I was mixing.On the plus side, it seemed to do the trick in a pinch, although I haven't tried anything as demanding as ice cubes.Eventually, I got rid of this blender in place of a more expensive model, not because it broke, but because I was tired of using something so shoddily made."
1,Run away from this,"I bought this blender 3 months back and hardly used 10-20 times. Then on one fine day, suddenly the blade stops turning even though you can hear the motor running. Looks like there is nothing wrong with the base or the motor, it would never do its job of grinding or blending. I didnt expect Black and Decker product would fail soo early.I bought the hand blender too from them and its the same story with it as well. Motor stopped working, with no prior indications. DONT BUY THIS EVEN IF YOU GET IT CHEAPER."
5,Good low-priced Blender,"I've had this product for about 3 months. It has done a great job making milk shakes, mixing drinking, etc. etc. It does take a little more time to crush ice, but that is to be expected for a blender in this price range. Clean up is easy. For the average user this is a terrific product!!!"
1,"Sit, but no spin.","I've bought two. One, as a gift, several months ago, and (so far) it's still working. I needed a new blender, and ordered this. Plugged it in, turned it on, nothing. Not even smoke. Fortunately, Amazon is great on returns like this. I'd be curious about how many they've had shipped back. Gotta cost 'em."
1,IF YOUR ARE BUYING THEN DOn'T BUY THIS...,"I bought this one, weared off the parts very easyly and also the parts are not eaayly available. Blades are twisted with 3 months use. and the burning smell is coming now. So better try to get good one."
3,OK for the Price,Seems to work well with plenty of power but it will not make mayonaise and some other blended sauces.
3,Delivery Date is questionable,"I ordered this blender with the message that ""It usually ships within 24 hours"". I ordered it on July 8, and I received a ship date between July 16-21. I think this is unacceptable. I have cancelled my order and am now shopping again for another blender or vendor of this blender."
1,You get what you pay for...,"If you believe you get what you pay for, then you may wish to consider spending a little more money for a blender.I was compelled by the price of the BL600B. The construction is chintzy to say the least. I admit, I also choose it for the color. There are not too many blenders out there available in black.But, now I'm going to do my homework and shop for another blender.I'm really dissappointed with the B&D unit. The blade assembly binds up that results in requiring to dump the contains and start all over. Besides being an inconvenience, I've wasted a lot of food!The only thing I've used it for is to blend healthy shakes that consist of milk and some powder.My suggestion is pass on this one and spend a little more money and purchase a higher quality blender."
5,Beats the more expensive brands!,"I've had every expensive brand of blender and this beats them all. It can easily turn ice cubes into snow with no liquid, and if you don't believe me, there's a 30-day money-back guarantee in the box!"
1,Do not recommend this one,"Blender leaked and also noted the burning smell others reported. Not heavy usage, mostly pureeing soups and drinks. Discovered base ring is cracked. Emailed for replacement, no reply. Found parts site (Black & Decker sold the appliance division, so it is B&D name only), ordered replacement. After weeks was told all parts are unavailable in all colors, buy a new blender is only option."
2,smoking blender?,This worked great for a few months. We were in smoothie heaven! Then one day I was making a smoothie & ended up with a house full of smoke from the burned up motor! I learned my lesson & will fork out the money for a better model.
1,Blender Lasted Less Than 24 Hrs,"I spent quite a bit of time researching blenders and the Black & Decker BL600B seemed to be one of the better ones despite the mixed reviews.I bought the blender on a Friday night used it to make a mango lassi (smoothie). It worked pretty good for that.The next day came the real test. I tried to make some beet hummus (cooked beetroot, cooked chickpeas, yogurt, tahini, lime juice, vegetable stock and olive oil). I loaded all the ingredients, with the soft beets first. After turning the machine on, the ingrediants didn't mix well, I tried the various speed and the motor started to slow, and after about 1 minute, started to smoke. So, I burned it out rather quickly.Maybe a blender cannot handle making hummus. Most recipes say use a blender or food processor.Anyway, I took the machine back and I am now looking for a better blender."
1,Blender Blades Bind,I bought this blender in September and it worked great until December. Mixing only milk and powder the black disk on the bottom bound to the gray blade disk and the kitchen counter was covered with small plastic pieces. I called customer service and they first said that this was a wear item and not covered by warranty and to send them $17. I insisted that there should not be a failure due to wear and tear after only three months. They agreed to send out a replacement blade for free. There is something major wrong with this design that should be corrected.I would not get this again. Hope the blade comes soon.
1,This blender smokes...,"...but not in a good way. After 5 months of daily use the motor locked up, produced an evil smelling smoke and just died. Done in by a frozen banana."
1,Very Angry and just plain frustrated,"My husband and I finally, like everyone else here, decided to buy this blender and loved it...for three months. After a short life of being used less than a dozen times the plastic plate holding the blade cracked enabling a big leak from the bottom of the container. I feel violated, like I have been robbed in broad daylight, but no one stops."
1,Deceptive Blender.,"I bought this blender in Best Buy for about $29 or so as a replacement to my Osterizer which was about 8 yrs old. My osterizer is not broken and I just bought this because of the good price and also I wanted something to match my other appliances in kitchen. I thought, I can forget buying a blender for atleast 5 years. Oh god, may be the quality of blenders is going down or something, this one stopped working with a burning smell in less than 6 months. I don't recommend this one to anyone who is expecting durability out of this product."
1,Yuck!!! Run away from this one,"I bought this as a result of lots of good reviews. When I got the blender, I thought it was broken because it didn't change speeds (as determined by the noise not changing pitch), regardless of which button was pushed. I called service, sent them the old power cord, and they were quick to send a replacement. When I got the replacement, IT STILL ONLY HAD ONE SPEED. OK, I put up with that. But, after only several months of light use, the motor burned out. I spliced the new cord to the original unit, and now that one is burning out too. This thing has always been NOISY to the point of being painful on the ears; All conversation stops while the blender is running. One bad unit may have been a fluke, but two in a row??? I really like to save money where I can, and hate to toss stuff in the trash, but I wasted good money on this one, and am sending it straight to the landfill."
1,Motor burned out,"Got this product in September 2004 - used it occasionally about once a week - guess what, in a month, the motor burned out.This has never happened with any blender I have owned before.Definitely not recommended."
2,Death By Margarita,"The price is great and the glass jar is great. The problem is that this blender just does not hold up if you are blending frozen drinks, such as Margaritas and Ice-Blended Mochas. After a year of blending an average of two of these drinks a week (just on weekends and one per person, mind you) the motor is burning out and the acrid smell of burned metal and plastic fills the air."
2,"Leaking issue, watch out!","Just as posted by others, the bottom under the glass portion leaks.Warranty is out 2 days ago, now have to pay for parts and shipping, very disappointing!"
1,Another broken hinge!,We got this on 12/25/11 and by 12/31/11 the hinge had broken. We used it each morning for waffles during those days but 6 days and it's completely broken is totally unacceptable. I expected more from Black & Decker. We've returned it and will be purchasing a different brand.
1,it's the hinge.....,"Black and Decker used to have an excellent reputation, but this one appliance could ruin that for good! Cooked some good waffles once, cleaned it, put it away. When I went to get it out for a second time, this evening, the hinge broke. Pieces literally fell out on the counter. We still used it as I had the batter made and, actually, the waffles turned out fine. But we'll not be keeping it as one with a hinge that works is definitely preferable."
4,B&D waffle maker WBM500,"Black & Decker WBM500 Belgian Waffle MakerIf you READ the directions & follow them, this little waffle maker works just fine. This is the second one I bought(1st one I had for many yrs.)Its perfect for 2 or 3 people, or if you just don't want to deal with a big, heavy, clunky waffle maker.Economicly priced too."
2,Rubbish!,First hinge pin broke after the second use. Second one broke after the third use. Looks like the head just shatters the plastic. Very poor design! Waffles tend to stick unless you spray oil on both sides before pouring the batter each and every time. Don't wast your money--I'm sorry I did.
2,Belgian (no way),"Unless the description of a Belgian Waffle has changed, this is a very poor example. The thin small indentations made by this unit make it more closely resemble a grill marked pancake."
1,Horrible Clean-up,"I would not recommend this waffle-maker. The lower handle provides a place for batter to ooze into, and it can't be cleaned out! And you can't unscrew the screws to get at the area. The light timer makes dark waffles, not to my kids liking. I'm ready to pull my old waffle maker out of the attic!"
2,YEP< Its the hinge!,"Got two waffle makers for Christmas. (the list you know) Really liked this one because it looked nicer and the brand gave it the appearance of being more expensive. We kept the other one, as we like to make a bunch and freeze them, so two would work fine. Well we had a problem with this one right away, and my DH called B&D and they sent us a replacement. The replacement broke, guess where? , at the hinge! So we've been using it for the last 6+ months like it is. Am currently shopping Amazon for a professional one like I saw at Costco."
1,Don't Buy,"The cheap plastic hinges broke after 2 months normal use.Further, Amazon gives you the run-around trying to returnit."
1,Hinges constantly break,"We have used this waffle maker twice since we purchased it. Both times the plastic hinges have broken. The warranty is through a 3rd party, not Amazon or Black & Decker. When we call to report it for the warranty, they are unwilling to refund or allow us to upgrade(and pay cost difference). They simply send us 2 more plastic hinges.Spend the money and don't buy this low grade waffle maker as it's poor design."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap...",Hinges are plastic and literally fractured and fell out after TWO USES. Non-stick inner coating also showed signs of chipping and wear after TWO USES. Avoid this waffle maker. It appears that Black and Decker wasted all their money on the stainless steel exterior and went cheap on all the other components.
2,Hinge pins broken,Loved it the first few times. Quickly the plastic hinge pins both broke. I don't recommend this one.
2,Belgian Waffle Maker,"I own this product but on choosing a waffle maker for my daughter, I did not consider purchasing another one. I have had it a year, using it about once a month. It sticks and the light doesn't always work. It does make waffles but I will be purchasing a different one in the near furture."
1,Died fast,"Made about 10 waffles decently, then something in the electrics died and it refuses to heat up any more. Waste of money, buy a better unit."
1,Worse than useless hinge pins; 2 waffles until breakage,The hinge pins broke on the second waffle. They sell no parts. Cannot find a way to fix it. I figure that makes it about $15 per waffle until it is unsafe and a burn/electrical hazard. I should have avoided this but did not research first. Not many of us research a $30 item. DO NOT BUY unless you have money you do not want.
1,Dead after 6 uses,"Owned this poor quality waffle maker for a year. Used it 6 times. It burnt out this morning. Dead, Nada, Zippo!Avoid like the plague!"
1,"Works great, until the hinge pins fall apart",Bought in November 2011. Last weekend (June 2012) the hinge pins fell apart. This has been used less than 10 times. Would not recommend wasting your money on this.
1,Terrible,"A complete piece of junk. The hinges, just like everyone else have broken twice. Returning for a refund as the replacement hinges broke after 2 uses."
1,Broke on First Use,"The hinges are made of plastic and broke the first time we used it, Christmas morning. And I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned the handle fills with batter and can't be cleaned."
2,Breaks too easy,I got my waffle maker for Christmas as a gift. The quality of the finished waffle is fine. The clean-up is no harder than similar items around the house. It needs no spray or oil too releasae the waffle. The only thing bad is the cheap... I mean really cheap hinge pieces. The hinge buttons broke after only a few uses. I intend to ask black a decker for replacements. I will see if they really stand by thier product. The waffle maker is useless without these buttons.
2,Short lasting,"Made great evenly cooked waffles, but we were greatly disappointed that the PLASTIC HINGE broke after about 3 uses. Save your money and buy one that isn't made of plastic for the key moving component."
1,This thing is junk,"Dear Black and Decker people:Suggestion: You might want to quit making cheap junk in China. Went into your store and it's ALL made there.This waffle maker could not survive a four inch fall out of the lower kitchen cabinet!Oh, and tell your product engineers that plastic hinges may not be the best idea.I'm done with Black and Decker junk."
1,Don't Bother,"I didn't get through a single batch of batter before the hinge pins popped out. They won't stay in at all now. Also, with the few waffles that I made with it; the top of the waffles was always darker than the bottom. I know it is an inexpensive thing, but it should have lasted and performed much better than it did. Tomorrow it goes back to the store."
1,DON'T BUY THIS WAFFLE MAKER - HAZARDOUS,Got this wafflemaker as a christmas gift from my kids.... Made waffles for them Christmas day... Waffle maker broke at the hinge... very dangerous when hot and there is no working hinge... contacted their warranty service who sent me new hinge pins... NOW on January 30 made Sunday morning breakfast for the kids with my new hinge pins in the waffle maker... Guess what!!!!!! It broke again... Used it twice and it broke twice... Black and Decker should be ashamed of itself to create such a shoddy product and Walmart should be held liable for selling them.... Mine is going to the trash where it belongs... I cannot trust it with kids trying to make breakfast... You cannot imagine the damage this has done to my kids feelings of buying a Christmas gift for their dad and watching it break on the first use.... B&D product??? Never again....
2,"Once it breaks, forget it.","Well it made good waffles, but one day the hinge pins broke. Black & Decker told me when I called that they do not sell replacement parts for it. I guess they want you to buy a new waffle maker, which I will. But you can bet it won't be Black & Decker. I don't care if it's just a waffle maker or if it's a car, the company that sells a product must stand behind it or I'm looking elsewhere. And that goes for Black & Decker drills, saws, and other tools as well. I'm done with them."
2,Broke on the 3rd time,I received this waffle maker as a Christmas gift and the little plastic hinge/pin that holds the two heavy irons together broke the 3rd time I used it. I spent way too long on hold with the service dept. trying to get a replacement part...I never got through to a human. It is going back to the store and we're going to try something else.
2,A waffle maker is not a power tool,"When I see the Black and Decker name, I think rugged, tough, and durable. I don't think it's something that's going to fall apart doing the thing it was designed to do.And yet, that's exactly what this waffle maker did for us.There was an upside - it made very tasty waffles. It made very tasty waffles twice, in fact! Then the hinges cracked and fell off, rendering it unusable.We weren't throwing it around, mind you. Not playing catch with it or even trying to see who could smash more batter into it. Just trying to make plain old waffles, as we've done with other waffle makers dozens of times before, and since.And yet, it broke. Not just a little broke, either. So broke that we couldn't use it anymore. So broke that even MacGyver couldn't have used it.So, yes, it makes waffles. It makes very good waffles. Twice. Then it's done, and for the landfill. Our replacement waffle maker will be a different model.Black and Decker should stick to making power tools."
1,Piece of crap!,Used the thing one time. Made about 3 waffles and the hinge broke on one side. Made a couple more and the other side broke. DO NOT BUY THIS THING! Doesn't even deserve one star really.
1,Flawed design,Like others have said the pins that act as a hinge will break. Ours came broken. We asked for and received new pins under warranty. The pins went in ok but the 1st time we used it they both broke again.
1,Doesn't last,I use this every Sunday - the hinges broke after 5-6 uses. I will be buying the Waring Pro next.
2,Ok If You Like Waffle Wedges,"I owned a Cusinart Waffle Maker, and it bit the dust. Just stopped heating one day. So I went online and researched the best waffle makers, hoping to buy one I liked as much. Unfortunately, all the research was tossed out when, one waffle-craving day, I bought this model on sale at Wal-Mart. It in no way measures up to by beloved Cusinart. There is only one setting. The light comes on when the waffle is cooked to the machine's satisfaction. Lifting the waffles out of the appliance is a skill I have not yet mastered, and the waffle breaks into four distinct wedges due to the deep crease dividing the plates. Also, this model has no cord wrap, making it somewhat clumsy to store. But at least I can have waffles now!PS-- I suggest Krusteaz waffle mix."
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE AVOID,USED 3 TIMES AND THE PLASTIC HINGE BROKE. EVERY PENNY WAS SAVED TO MAKE THIS PRODUCT... METAL HINGES MUST BE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR BLACK AND DECKER....I GOT WHAT I DESERVED FOR HAVING BRAND LOYALTY AND WILL RETHINK MY POSITION ON ALL BLACK AND DECKER PRODUCTSABSOLUTE GARBAGEDONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS PRODUCT
1,this is complete junk,"I received this waffle maker as an xmas gift. Upon removing it from the box one of the hinge covers fell to the floor. Following the first use the second hinge cover came off. Only thing is they werent hing covers, they were the actual hinge. The two halves are held together by a 2 cent piece of plastic, complete crap. If you bought this at the dollar store you would be hard pressed to get your moneys worth. Avoid at all costs. My 2 yr old has kitchen toys that are put together better and are more durable. But atleast its made in the usa....oh wait. I will never own a single black and decker product. EVER"
2,Hinge pins broke,"We bought this waffle maker at a sale after Thanksgiving. I loved it at first! My waffle maker made nice waffles and my indicator light was working. Just recently my hinge pins broke. It is not safe to use anymore, as the lid will not stay up! I have only used about 6 times. Very disappointed in this product!!!"
3,Okay Waffle maker,"I recieved this waffle maker as a wedding present. I used it 2-3 times and it worked fine...after that, the waffles always stuck to both sides of the iron. I had to scrap the waffle off with a spatula. Doesn't work very well."
2,Great While It Lasted,"We really enjoyed this waffle maker - until it fell apart. Like some other owners experienced, the plastic hing broke after about 6 months of use. It doesn't have any variable setting for cooking times, but we got pretty good at figuring out exactly when they were done. Maybe I'll call B&D and see if they want to replace it....with a power tool (something they are better at)."
1,Hinge pin is junk.,"This waffle iron makes decent waffles, but the construction is unbelievably cheap. The hinge pins that keep the hinge together are constructed from cheap, brittle plastic. They break after a couple uses. Save yourself some headaches and get some other waffle iron. A waffle iron should be relatively trouble free as the design is rather simple, but Black and Decker managed to screw this one up anyway."
1,Broken Hinge,I received the Black and Decker Belgian waffle Maker for Christmas 17 months ago. The unit makes large crispy waffles. I was satisfied with its performance after about 50 uses. I would have given it a 5 star review on this basis. Unfortunately the hinge that holds the top to the bottom of the unit broke. This occurred with careful handling and no abuse on my part. The hinge is a hollow piece of split plastic that is very cheaply made. A solid hinge would probably have been less expensive to fabricate and would have lasted a long time. I would not recommend this unit. Luckily a simple wire nut was nearly the same diameter and it is now my new hinge!
4,Not as bad as everyone says,"The first time I used this waffle maker I was very disappointed and regretted the purchase. However, I gave it another chance. The second time I used the recipe that came with the instructions and the waffles turned out great. My husband said they were even better than the ones I used to make. To avoid the waffle breaking when lifting them out, I lift part of the waffle slightly with a knife and slide a round wire rack under it."
1,Cheap plastic,"I just purchased this waffle iron and I didn't even get to used it! My family made waffles yesterday and the hinge broke with the first use. The hinge is made of a plastic that obviously doesn't hold up. I chose this waffle iron because it looked similar to my old one that I had for over 25 years. I know that they don't make things like they used to, but I expected it to last longer than 1 day. I do not recommend this waffle iron. I will be looking for something with a sturdier metal hinge."
1,"Great Waffles, Poor Parts","This waffle maker makes great waffles, easy to clean and heats well, until, as all the other reviewers have noted, the cheap plastic hinges make it fall apart after a few uses. I'm on #2 and looking for a new waffle maker. Shouldn't have bought a second one but I returned the first so the second was an exchange. Didn't matter. Same problem, same part. Cheap plastic hinges."
2,deceiving,the name of this waffle Iron is Belgian waffle makerthe waffles come out very flat not at all like a Belgian waffle[...]
3,"Works great, but bad construction","The unit itself makes great waffles, however, I experienced the same issue as many other reviewers with the hinge breaking. Other than the subpar construction, the unit works wonderfully, cooks waffles perfectly with easy removal and it looks good."
4,Makes great waffles but has one flaw.,I bought the Black & Decker WMB500 waffle maker about a year ago and love the way it makes waffles. The biggest plus is that they don't stick. I spray it once with PAM before I start and never have a sticking problem. I don't us the indicator light to judge when to take the waffles out. I causes them to cook way too much. I just time them for 2 1/2 minutes and they come out fine.The one serious flaw is the plastic pieces they use to hold the top and bottom together. They are called Hinge Caps and break after use probably caused by the heat. [...] They want [...] for shipping to the lower 48. I live in Hawaii so they want over $20 to ship them. I ordered 8 and had them shipped for [...] to my sister-in-law in Florida and she mailed them to me for [...]. Now I have enough to last awhile as they break.
3,Picture on the page is incorrect.,"The pitcher that is ""pictured"" for this item is a wonderful pitcher! I was looking forward to getting more like that, but when I got the pitchers that I purchased from this page, they are NOT like the one shown in the picture and not as good of quality make. I was very disappointed."
4,Good qulity but VERY small,I was looking for a lunch box and thought this one would replace my plastic one. The quality of the dish is very good but it is too small.
2,Not So Valuable,"Using these cartridges with the Flowtron BK-80D bug zapper, didn't seem like they made much of a difference to our mosquito neighbors. However, the bug zapper did a heck of a job with the flies that had recently moved in with us."
3,Effectiveness,We used the insect repellant for a party we had on the deck. I think it did a decent job.
1,Disappointed,I have been using the product continuously for two months and the mosquitoes are still plentiful.
2,Too expensive and unnecesary since your flowtron does the work,"Despite the fact this octenol attracts somehow the mosquito, its unnecesary, and too expensive. Dont buy it, the bulb light does the work"
1,Hard to determine effectiveness...,"...of the cartridges when the Flowtron machine itself broke down before I got to use them. Machine shorted after only 6 weeks. I guess the old adage holds true: ""You get what you pay for."""
3,The jury is still out...,"I bought the additional mosquito attractant to go with the Flowtron BK-40D bug zapper. Can't really tell if it is adding to the effectiveness of the bug zapper or not. Still have some mosquitoes, but they are fewer in number. Could be the bug zapper alone and the attractant isn't helping. A little too early to tell."
1,Skeeters Laugh,"I bought the zapper and it came with the skeeter attractent. When I go out in the morning to shut the zapper off.The skeeters start having a buffet on me.The zapper works fine,don't waste your money on the Octenol Mosquio Bait. Its useless."
1,Fantasy,"And once again, I consign the notion of a mosquito-free evening that doesn't end with me scrubbing DEET off my whole body to the realm of fantasy."
1,Threw them away the same day I got them.,"I didn't even try to use them. If you read the warnings on the back of the package, it's pretty scary. The warnings say not to breath, or touch the octenol at all and to seek medical attention if you do. When the package arrived from UPS it stunk! Sitting on my couch I opened the package(cardboard amazon box, not the octenol package or lures themselves) and got a headache within a couple of minutes from the smell. There is no way I could live with that smell every time I went into my backyard. The Flowtron 80D does a good job without them. I threw the octenol lures away the same day they arrived."
1,Not sure how effective it is,"I bought a Flowtran 40W several weeks ago. I used the trap with and without the Octenol. In my opinion, there is hardly any difference whether I use the octenol or not. The trap only works after sunset, and it seems like the light is the only thing that attracts the bugs. When I am out during the day working in the yard, I can see mosquitoes trying to bite me, but they don't bother to check out my trap+octenol set up. If they like Octenol, I should hear the 'zap' throughout the day, but I don't. I also read the government reviews ([...]) and it doesn't look like Octenol does any 'magic' to attract the bugs."
1,Mosquitos laugh at it,"The flowtron MA 1000-6 octenol mosquito attractant is a fairly expensive addition to your bluish-light electric mosquito zapper. The mosquitos in our yard seem no less dense and active than they were before I used the attractant. Indeed, they were either laughing at the attractant, or were angrier than normal because of it. Frankly, I found it ineffective; yet, others may well have had the opposite experience as each situation (trees, grass, dampness, water supply, winds, etc.) is different."
4,Good product,I have only used two of these as of this date but I have found mosquitos attached to both of them so it appears to work.
3,As soon as I got the mosquito's were gone,As soon as I got the mosquito's were gone. 11 more words required. ho ho ho ho ho ho lol.
4,good product,"works well, but would be nice if it lasted longer. I suggest buying two packages at a time due to the short life."
2,These Attractants Don't Seem to Work.,"I got this along with the Fly Sex Lure and neither of them seem to work. This has more toxic warning than I see on a can of Raid, but so far, I haven't found a dead mosquito since I put on in. Now, maybe we don't have a lot of mosquito like they do in North Dakota and this thing would work like a god up there, but in New Mexico, unless you live by lots of water, save your money.The good thing is you seem to get a lot of them for the price, but more doesn't seem to help and they don't smell very good.Flowtron MA-1000-6 Octenol Mosquito Attractant Cartridges, 6-Pack"
3,Flowtron MA-10000-6 Octenol Mosquito Attractant Cartridges,I can't say whether or not it works well. I don't really notice a big difference between having and not having them put on the Flowtron Mosquito zapper.I think it is pricey for something that doesn't produce a clear result.
3,it's bug stuff,"It smells, it works.It's a bit of a pain not to get the poison on hands when installing.Pricey.Bug stuff, what can I say!"
3,Not Ernie Pook's Comeek,I didn't realize that this was actually a short book of vignettes as opposed to an illustrated story or comic. I had just finished The!Greatest!Of!Marlys! and have been a fan of Lynda Barry's comics for quite some time. This is more like her book Cruddy than her comics. I just could not get quite as into this book as I might have had I known what I was in for when I bought it. It will be enjoyable for anyone who loved Cruddy but if you are looking for something like Marlys et. al. than this may not be what you are looking for.
5,a gem of childhood,"It won't take you long to finish this book of vignettes that weave together into a complete story. Yet, it is a book of incredible wisdom and courage, seen through the eyes of a young girl who lives in a neighborhood that is settling in after ""white flight."" Through the narrator's perspective, Lynda Barry palpably demonstrates the impact of racial integration and tension via the friendship between a young white girl and young black girl. Is such a friendship possible, when you have a ""no Negroes allowed inside"" rule at your house? Or when you visit the projects with your friend, and a boy calls her ""Unca Tom"" merely for being with a white girl? And what happens when girls grow up and graduate out of grade school?Lynda Barry has the voice of the young girl down perfectly, expressing the things that young girls think and worry about, including the angst and dreams of fitting in and belonging. Bittersweet and compelling, I highly recommend this simple coming-of-age tale."
3,I've used better...,like the broad spectrum this sunblock provides but I found it to be runny and messy. It took a considerable amount of time before it was completely absorbed by my skin.
1,terribly sunburned using this product,I would not use this product again. I got terribly sunburned in spite of applying it well and frequently.
1,I got the worst sunburn in my life...,"because of this product. I re-applied frequently and at even intervals. I made sure to put it on as soon as I came out of the water. It says waterproof, but that's a complete lie. It came off as soon as I touched the water. I figured out later that just normal tap water can take it off. It was completely useless."
4,Getting Better!,"In the past, games have been missing game footage.This DVD has every play.They only edited out one huddle of 32 seconds, but all downs are there.The quality seems like they could put out something better, but it is overall good......I still wish they would just add a 2nd disc and put the entire ORIGINAL feed of the game for sale.They edit out pre game and other things in the game."
4,2500 miles without a problem,I have driven the car for 3 months now and the transmission shudder that occured when I had been driving for long periods of time like 3-4 hours has not returned even in desert weather. Nissan Altima 2.5 L
1,Disappointed,Just received it from Ritz Interactive yesterday. Was working fine when I connected it but this morning it conked out crashing my computer. Called Samsung support and they determined it's faulty. Will ship me a new one but this does not diminish the frustration and time wasted.
5,King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table,This book was full of adventure and action! I think that the best part of the book was seeing how King Arthur lost and found his sword. I think it was one of the best books that I have read!!
1,Little useful information,"This book tries to dumb-down SIP. It looks like it wants to be a training manual for a ""Learning SIP"" course, but doesn't provide any real technical detail. It is poorly written and a tedious read.This is the first sentance:""SIP is a standardized technology that allows for the sending of voice, data, and video between communication devices on public (e.g. Internet) or private (e.p. local area networks) data networks.""... and it doesn't get any better after that.SIP Demystified by Gonazlo Camarillo is a much better read. It is engaging and well written, providing useful information for IT engineers, managers and technologists."
3,Better than average B-flick,"Not Igmar . . . but Sandahl . . .Bergman - in her best and most revealing footage - with delightful help from 80's Playmate Shannon Tweed - make this otherwise inept film worth watching for afficianados of the eternal feminine. I fast-fowarded it through the boring parts. But it proves once again - that cheap B films with beautiful ladies still vaguely in their prime and desperate for a few bucks make the night go easier and evoke a wierd sort of fascination and thus value. In the end, much in the Shakespearean tragic tradition, all the characters kill off each other in one big blow-out scene, which would make perfect sense if any one of these aspiring thesbians had more than the barest claim to a shread of acting ability to cover their bare bodies, or bodkins, or bald ignorance, most of which is in full display here."
2,"Sexy, but...",I really like Shannon Tweed. I think she's beautiful. You can see her working out in a very sexy outfit. If you like Shannon Tweed you would like to see it. The plot of the movie is entertaining but the end of the movie *****.

2,Bought it for the wild girl,I bought this movie becuase i like the wild girl in the movie with all the war paint on. The movie is below average.
3,"surprisingly fun, rent-worthy","I was surprised by how much I ended up liking this movie. Sure it is formulaic, and you kind of get the feeling you've seen it before, but for what it is, this movie is fun, and good 'escapism.' As mentioned, like others in its genre, a lot of it is pretty familiar territory, but unlike many others in its genre, the acting is decent, some pretty original action scenes, and it is pretty enjoyable throughout (as opposed to others that are more of a 'cool scene' once in a while). I wouldn't buy it, but if you need a good film to just kind of 'check out' and eat some popcorn, this will serve you well."
4,Fun Movie,"""Doomsday"" may not be the most realistic (or original) take on the post-apocalyptic genre, but it delivers exactly what it promises: Good, bloody, violent fun. In fact, I enjoyed it much more than many of last year's other popcorn flicks, such as ""Eagle Eye,"" or ""Wanted."""
2,A Mosh Pit of Mayhem,"Doomsday is the story of Eden Sinclair (played by Rhona Mitra), a one-eyed wonder soldier who is sent into a virus-quarantined Scotland to search for the scientist Kane. It is here that the story takes off.The movie starts well, building an intriguing story and background. The acting and script are good, and me are pulled into what appears to be a very good movie.But somewhere about a third of the way in, it falls apart. Once inside the walled city, the movie turns into a non-stop action flick, with endless machine gun blasts, blood-spurting scenes, raging virus-infected freaks, and of course cannibals.It is here that the good actors that set the pace early on are missing. It is also at this point in the movie where a well-paced loses wind, and takes us on a ride that gets tedious quickly.See the movie for yourself, but expect this roller coaster to go downhill fast after 40 minutes."
4,You Must Be This Tall To Ride Doomsday!,"This really is an excellent rollecoaster ride. Take out your brain and set it aside for a couple hours. Sometimes its nice to be simply entertained and not have to think. This is one of those times. Great Sexy action flick with beautiful sound and picture quality. A nice reference disk to show your friends who are still watching Full Screen Star Wars on VHS Tapes. I give the movie four stars. Five stars if you include the impressive PQ and SQ. Shades of Escape from New York and The Road Worrior are impossible not to notice. Not the best movie you will ever see, but far from the worst and a lot of fun along the way."
2,Seriously?,"I wanted to like this movie, because I thought the idea was actually pretty interesting, and until they ran into the first survivors, it was fairly good. From there it became a very poor wanna-be replica of ""Escape from NY"" mixed with the ""Mad Max"" series. They missed many good opportunities that could have been explored, like they could have done so much with the fallout shelter they found, and the concept of what would happen to the survivors and the dynamic of how to reestablish a society in a case like this was an interesting thought, but they rushed through things that could have made the story more believable and interesting, instead going for shock and gore over a good plot. In the end I was questioning what the point of the whole thing was. I was very disappointed."
3,OH HELL YEAH!,"This actioner set in a post apocalyptic future stars magically babe-o-licious Rhona Mitra...MMMMMM....It is high on very stylized action...dashes of gore, and fast paced adrenaline pumping editing. Not going to win any awards but worth a watch...a a purchase if the price is right."
2,Watch this one for what it is,"That's it. Watch it as a comedy and a satire made just for fun by Neil Marshall. Although it starts in quite serious tone, don't try to look for reasons, coherence or anything like that. Just watch it for what it is, a fast run movie through the cliches of the post apocalyptical movies. That way you will probably find it entertaining and funny. You will probably notice the flaws, lots of them, but with that attitude you won't care much. I'd bet they are there on purpose. Some quite disgusting scenes are there too if you have a good stomach (pay attention to my advice and don't eat anything before). What I disliked the most is that I find the post apoc with wild punkies and motocycles way too boring for my taste, taken seriously or just for fun. For my taste it's one of the best ways to spoil a good story like in Waterworld or Doomsday."
4,GOOD ACTION MOVIE,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS ACTION PAKED , THRILLING AND ENTERTAINING IN THE STYLE OF MAD MAX MOVIES ."
1,"sorry, it's not a good movie!",make it short:) in the movie human kill and eat other human! one of the worst movie of this year!
2,Eh...well it is fun I guess,"Doomsday...this is not an original movie. This is more like a slapped together homage to other, better movies, if not a complete ripoff of them. If that is your thing, then go for it. Personally, I enjoyed parts of this B movie but admit that it is unoriginal trash as well. Fun to watch when you want mindless action - but remember to check your brain at the door as most of it makes no sense at all."
1,Rubbish,"What a waste of money! I had a hard time thinking of a worst film, but still couldn't come up with anything. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is laughable and the directing is that of an 8-year old who just got a video camera for present. I was desperately looking for a comic relief that would turn this film into a parody of the action and epic genre but oh no, the (obviously) underage director of ""doomsday"" took his work all too seriously. ""Mad Max"" meets ""28 Days Later"", ""The Lord Of The Rings"" meets ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Absolute garbage."
4,Doomsday,It is a good action movie to enjoy but it is not everyone's one cup of tea. The story is simple but the action is great.
3,Potluck Action!,"Doomsday recipeChop finely: Resident Evil 2, AliensAdd liberal helping of Mad Max/punked out survivorsA pinch of random medieval-nessAdd chunks of gooey bitsFill to the brim with actionSet the blender on 11 and stand back!If you like crazy action and don't stop to wonder about things like ""Would this really happen in only 30 years?"" then grab some drinks and watch Doomsday."
2,Not a complete waste of time,Starts off pretty bad but gets better. The audio mixing was poor so dialog from the center channel is hard to hear over the racket from the other speakers. Some annoying editing (chopped up action scenes)at times but also some interesting camera work in some scenes. Lots of over the top violence in this unrated version. Some of the action scenes were suspenseful and others were unrealistic. I would give the movie two and a half stars if I could but three would be too generous. It falls well short of similar movies like Resident Evil or I Am Legend.
2,Nothing new,"This movie is nothing more than repackaging of used ideas. Matter of fact there is one sceane that is almost directly out of Mad Max, the road warrior. Out of the choice between Mad Max and this, I'd say go Mad Max."
2,"Neil, What the hell?","I was a huge fan of Dog Soldiers and The Descent. I had high expectations for Director Neil Marshalls first departure from the horror genre. Wow this film is awful. The non existant story is punctuated often with gratuitous gore that is totally out of place in this kind of film. The gore in his previous films served the story, not so in this. One stupid pointless gory scene after another. I made it through an hour of this and turned it off. I sincerely hope Neil's next film is better than this. Shouldn't be too hard."
2,this is not a good choice,"The video is good, and so is the sound, but the movie is a really bad choice. At first sight it seems to be a good action movie, but it is just a bad copy of mad max, with some new stuff, like the combination of an apocalyptic civilization with a normal civilization."
2,Ultimately Offers Nothing Memorable,"I wasn't expecting much when I rented Doomsday given all the mediocre reviews in comparison to Marshall's previous efforts, and my preconceived notions proved entirely correct. Every other reviewer hit the nail on the head in stating that this movie borrows from a slew of other post-apocalyptic films that did a much better job in contributing to the genre. There are no memorable characters nor are there any exceptionally cool scenes, which are the two main characteristics that draw me to these types of films. The action sequences are only so-so, and the concept of knights versus punks was poorly executed. Do yourself a favor and pick upEscape from New York (Special Edition),The Road Warrior,28 Weeks Later / 28 Days Later (2 pack), or evenA Boy & His Doginstead."
1,"Not good bad, not fun bad, not Superbad - just bad.","This movie is just plain bad. You know that feeling you get when someone makes a really bad pun? Imagine that exact sensation, that feeling of annoyance, crankiness, disappointment and mild frustration just before you groan aloud and roll your eyes, lasting for 120 minutes - at which point you will groan aloud and roll your eyes. Reading the other reviews I thought this might be a guilty pleasure - instead it's just a damn shame. I'd rather sign a 3-picture deal to play the corpse's groin in the next ""Weekend at Bernie's"" sequels than endure this again."
1,A Bad Eighties Movie...,"...Today! Although this is close to having potential...it sucks.It has the special effects from the eighties, the idiosyncrasies of old genre movies like THE ROAD WARRIOR, and a pretty good cast. But, it sucks. I wanted to like this movie, but...it sucks."
5,awesome...........,Great action great violence and gore. Rhona mitra is amazing and tough as hell..... great stunts and you can't take your eyes off the screen. It makes my top 20 films ever...
4,A good nature video,"I managed to obtain this tape along with volume 2 for a song, and it has been the bargain of the century. Our 2-year old son loves to watch the footage of parent/baby animals and birds. The film quality is a bit old fashioned but the shots are well selected and edited: there is NO animal getting killed in this video -- a big plus in my opinion. The narration is informative but kind of goofy, like those nature shows we had in elementary school. However it's a good tape to have on if you just want something pleasant in the background, and it's not so captivating that one is glued to the TV -- my son can break away and do more productive things, like playing with his toys (unlike when he's in front of Baby Einstein)."
4,The most reliable phone I've had in a while,"I have t say this is a pretty good phone. I've had it for about three years now. The original one I had was defected and after having it replaced I've seen no problems since. Awesome battery life and cool features. It's not high tech by far, but if you're looking for a decent phone this is it. I love it so much I'm thinking of buying a third one! It's one of those phones you can depend on."
3,Surprise - Rogers phone...,"Other reviewers had complained because the phones were T-Mobile, but that was a selling point for me, since that's our provider. However, the phone, although unlocked, was a ""Rogers"" phone. That means that many of the network features built into our other, identical, T-Mobile phone are just unavailable. This means T-Zones, automatic time set, etc. If we could have selected the provider (there should be many more T-Mobile phones), it would have been nice, rather than being a perpetual ""roamer."" Otherwise, the phone performs well..."
4,Very fine phone after 136 hours,"I've used this phone over 136 hours since purchase via T-mobile last December 2008. Good reception, good feel to keyboard, very loud/useful speaker-phone (can set on desk and both parties hear OK) and so-so camera. If you need an older but reliable phone, this one will work for you. I bought a second off ebay just to have a backup in case I lost this one. Cheap insurance."
1,sorry,This phone has a lock out when you first get it. Then when you try to get help it is impossible. I can not even use the phone. Would never buy anything else from amazon
3,Branded,"Unlocked YES. Unbranded NO! The pictures show a unbranded phone but they are branded ""T Mobile"""
2,Disappointed customer,The phone does not work well. No paper work or address came with it to return if you are not satisfied. I emailed and they sent me an address but I felt insecure about sending it away and not even having a receipt that I could copy. When you open the phone it has a blank screen about 50% of the time. Can't be used until the screen finally reappears. (Can be a long time.)
2,I won't recommend this phone!,I ordered this phone and was looking forward to enjoying it but to my great disappointment the phone had a technical defect from the day i received it. The ear piece or voume control was faulty causing me to experience difficulty in hearing. I tried adjusting the volume controls several times but that didnt work so i ended up returning the product. I love nokia but this phone was the phone from hell!
4,handy reference,"I am an SLP at a special needs preschool. My colleagues and I (including OTs, PTs, psychologist, etc.) frequently refer to this book. It's easy to look up a syndrome by name or by characteristics. The entries are concise and easy to understand. The syndrome is described, and then characteristics such as speech/language disorders, physical features, differential diagnosis, history and prognosis are given. It's probably not the most comprehensive book out there, but we find it very handy for the population we serve."
4,Helpful information but...,"I think the information presented is helpful, for our field, and concise. However for the money I paid I would like nice quality photos. All the photos are pixelated and while it may not matter in terms of identifying a syndrome, I'm not sure why they felt the need to skimp on this part. Cell phone cameras take better pictures than those in this book."
1,not the answer,"Don't waste your money on this item. It only lights an extremely small area (not even the keyboard) unless you angle the shade towards you, in which case it shines directly in your eyes. Any small desk lamp would work even better for less than half the price."
5,the best waffle maker ever,"I HAD THIS WAFFLE MAKER BEFORE. I HAD IT FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS, THE ONLY REASON IT BROKE WAS MY TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER TRIED TO MAKE WAFFLES,SHE POURED TO MUCH BATTER IN AND IT WENT UNDER THE PLATES,THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE IN RIGHT.I HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THIS.I TRIED MANY OTHERS SOME I PUT IN THE TRASH AFTER THE FIRST USE.WENT TWO YEARS WITH OUT HOMEMADE WAFFLES.THEN I FOUND THIS I LOVE THIS WAFFLE MAKER IT IS THE BEST.THE PLATES COME OFF FOR EASY CLEANING.THE LIGHT GOES OFF WHEN WAFFLES ARE DONE,TAKES THE GUESS WORK OUT OF IT.THE WAFFLES ARE PERFECT WHEN THEY ARE DONE.THE BEST EVER WAFFLE MAKER."
3,Sticky,"Works well but I find that the batter is constantly sticking to the ""nonstick"" surface. Even reoiling has not helped, so my next step is to change recipes and see if that helps."
