2,Hurts my daughter's feet,"Seems like a great item, and I purchased it based on other reviews. However, the textured (no-slip?) surface hurts my 4-year-old's bare feet when she gets on it to brush teeth or wash hands. I will be returning it and trying something else."
2,Too short...,"This stool is only 6 inches tall (or a little less...the box it arrived in was 6 inches tall). There is no assembly it seems to be really great quality. Rubber skid resistant top and legs.I went to Target and bought an 8"" stool near the mops & buckets for $5.99 and will be returning this item."
3,Good but not so Good...,"I thought the whole point of this product was to help your toddler reach the toilet when training, but the step was still too low for my two-year old to reach it. It is sturdy but I will need to find something else in the meantime."
2,Too short to do any good,We agonized over which stool to buy our 2 yr old daughter. We wanted one that could be used to help her reach the toilet and later the sink as she got older. It's great for reaching the toilet and even eventually the light switch. But it's very short for trying to reach the sink.I do like the wide base (although she's still fallen off of it) and the rubber top.
5,"Love it, love it, love it!!!","Me and hubby are now using this step stool more than our 20 month old because she still refuses to start the ""potty training"" so we are not going to push her. This step helps me when I give her a bath and helps dad too when it is his turn for bath time so we know it is well built because I weigh 130 lbs and my hubby weighs 200 lbs. It is very sturdy, nice color for our ""Duck"" decor and I would definately recommend it to any parent for sure!!!!!!"
2,A bit slippy,"Its probably because my baby isn't tall enough, but He can't put his feet on this thing without it sliding when he is on the toliet. The top surface is nice, but the bottom needs more slide resistance."
5,Bany Bjorn Safe Step,"My son is very tall for his age and he outgrew his potty chair rather quickly, so we had to switch to the toilet. In combination with the Bjorn Potty seat, his stool has been a great. It is very stable and has a a non-slip surface. My son loves it. We even bought one for grandma's house."
5,My baby uses this all the time for many different reasons!,"well.. she uses when she takes a bath, for she likes to sit down on something rather than just sitting in the tub.she sits on this step when she plays her little toy piano.she totally take this thing around my house using it to climb up on the couch, reach the sink washing her hands & for many more reasons/ways~I love it!"
5,Sturdy,"I am happy with this step stool. I bought 2 for my daughter for our house. One is for the bathroom. She is 18 months old and can easily carry the stool to where she wants it. She uses it as a seat and stands on it. The top has grips to give her a non slip surface. I love the bright colors.I did not look for other step stools, so I am not comparing quality or prices. I bought this product because I have been very pleased with the baby born brand. I feel they have good quality products."
4,Sturdy Stool,"This stool is very sturdy and does not slide around. It is also lightweight, which makes it easy for a child to move from the toilet to the tub to the sink, etc... The only drawbacks are that the slip proof ridging traps dirt requiring regular cleaning and the stool is not quite tall enough for my daughter to wash her hands on her own at the sink. She is 2 and a half and on the tall side but we have tall vanities. She still needs to be lifted in order to wash her hands. She is fully independent on the toilet now with the stool. Overall I am happy with the purchase."
4,Perfect for little legs,"These stools are excellent for little legs, to help climb on the big potty or reach the sink to watch hands. Nonslip on top and bottom, plastic is easy to clean. I wish they were just slightly taller."
3,ok but a little low. two step stool might be better choice,I like this step stool in that the rubber on the bottom prevents skidding and is light enough for a 20 month old to move around. The downside is that it is really very low with our pedestal sink and my daughter is tall for her age! She still cannot reach the faucet which is half of the reason to have a step stool. You might want to consider a taller step stool or one that has two steps.
5,Helpful when potty training and teaching young ones to was hands.,The steep stool was perfect in helping my Grand Daughter potty train. Helpful for her to step on the stool and reach high enoungh to seat on the potty training seat. Now we are teaching her to wash her hands and she thinks it is fun by stepping on the step stool to reach the sink the same way it was fun in potty training.
5,Best stool we have!,"This is the second Babybjorn safe step I've purchased. Our two children, ages 2 and 4 have never slipped off the step. No matter how they stand on it, I've never seen it tip over either. Very secure - I highly recommend this stool for young children."
3,No toddler stool will fit everyone's needs perfectly...,"but in spite of some of the obvious flaws (as mentioned in detail by other reviewers) this stool has actually been perfect for us. We purchased the white one with the black top over 6 years ago. It still looks great & will last until the grand-kids at the rate it is holding up. It seems indestructible.Some reviewers complained that it tips if a child steps too close to the edge. There's a trade off here: if you build a perfectly stable stool with a wide base, then another safety scenario is created: the base becomes a tripping hazard.There are hazards in life. Nothing is perfectly safe. We taught our kids to step in the middle of the stool & demonstrated what would happen if they ignored our instructions. With these instruction the stool has worked like a charm."
4,Well Made,"This stool exceeded my expectations. I bought it for my 18 month Grandson to get a leg up on a climbing toy that just had a ladder that was hard for him to climb. The stool bottom grips well on both hard and soft(ex. carpet) surfaces. Though it functions extremely well for what we was bought for... our creative Grandson has found many more unforeseen uses as well. It is light enough for him to carry anywhere. Things that were to be ""out of reach"" previously were snatched up quickly. He has even turned it over to use a a make sift bucket. A product has to WOW me to earn a 5 star and this earned a high 4. Just be ready to do some nick nack rearranging!!!"
1,Don't bother,This stool is nothing special AT ALL! I paid like $16 for a stool that is not slide proof and is not tall enough to get my daughter's face over the bathroom counter. It was a total waste of money. I got a better stool from the dollar store!
5,"BABYBJORN Safe Step, White","What a great little step stool this is! Just the perfect size...nothing fancy, just 100% functional, well designed and made. It is much more compact than others out there, yet 100% safe for children to adults to use. We keep it on hand for our four little grandchildren to use at the bathroom sink or kitchen counter. I've tried others in the past...and this one is simply the best. A classic."
4,Great basic step stool,"This is a very basic and safe step for your growing child. It doesn't slip or move due to the rubber covering on the bottom. However, I didn't realize how much we would love the top rubber step covering. It's definitely helped save my child from a few slips. The step isn't at all tippy, but the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would love for it to be an inch higher."
5,Works for my triplets!,There is rubber on the bottom for no slip and rubber on the top for no slip as well! Height could be a bit taller but most are about the same height.
4,Well worth the money.,"If you are going to have only one Idol album, this is it. This one has all the songs I would have put on a ""Best Of"" (however, I would have included ""Blue Highway). There are a couple of ""duds"" on here (Sweet Sixteen), but overall, it is a very good collection of songs. I would recommend you buy it."
3,"almost, but...","Jeez! I mean, the guy didn't really have that many hits.""Vital Idol"" was anything but, and you can't even get the ""Rebel Yell"" (his classic) hits on a stateside collection. So to make up for it with this but not include his only other hit outside of it, ""Cradle of Love"", is just plain idiotic."
3,cute book,"Interesting little book, it was not written for age group I had intended, but no fault of anybody but me. Truly cockpit error."
4,Bee Happy: Exactly That,"This is a great cd that Nina fans will certainly appreciate. Many songs are written or co-written by Dee Dee Ramone, and therefore have a straightforward, early punk sound that's all about fun. It's much more lighthearted than Nina's earliest German music, and not as ""out there"" as Fearless or Nunsexmonkrock (which I happen to adore). ""Barbed Wire"" is hysterical, and ""Sunday Morning"" is just plain cute. I love it!"
3,Geared toward a newbie,"This book seems geared for the inexperienced user. Goes too much into needless details about trivial matters. This will help a ""career-changer"". This book assumes you have no previous experience whatsoever."
4,swearing allegiance,The movie was very interesting and the drama is good to watch with some one else. it tells you what could happen if you watch what your doing in life. Holly marie combs played her part very well.
5,Sad!,Bad choices were made and now 2 young people are in prison for life. They had such promising careers and they threw it all away for vengeance and murder. A beautiful young lady gone forever how sad!!!
4,Useful decorations for wedding greeting cards,"If you make very many Wedding greeting cards, this is a nice set of embossing folders to have in your Cuttlebug toolbox. The cards that are decorated with these embossed images seem to sell rather well, too.These folders are rather small, so I center the embossed image on an A2 (4.25""x5.5"") greeting card, and add text plus decorative items such as rhinestones and/or ribbon.Please see above customer images for two of my Wedding greeting cards using these folders."
5,Great for embossing,I use these for embossing card stock with my CuttleBug and they work fabulously! They make a very nice impression and are fun for my daughter to use as well. I would definitely recommend them.
5,The book renewed my faith in God and the events of Medjugore,"The apparitions have been occurring for several years now and this book gives the latest information coming from the area. Also, what has been going on in the lives of the visionaries. It is comforting to know they are having children and living ""normal"" lives . The message of Penance, prayer and conversion rings loud and clear. This will be a quick read."
4,Heartbeat is a HIT,Johnny M.'s Heartbeat is a riveting and emotional album with a great sound and authentic delivery. I strongly recommend Heartbeat to anyone who appreciates positive lyrics that come from the soul. Johnny's voice really captures the essence of each song put forth.
3,This edition is an abridgement. . .,"1 star = Amazon's publication information5 star = the novel itself.This edition is an abridgement of the original novel. Be warned: there is no indication in Amazon's publication info that this is an abridgement, except for the page count (120 pages).This edition is a good tool for those learning Latin American Spanish.Again the Santillana Edition is not the full novel."
2,This is a review of EL Presidente,"The reason that I picked up this reading is that I was told that this was an excellent portrayal of Latin American dictators. In terms of content and substance, I don't know if it is accurate. However, from the aesthetic point of view, the book is full of disgusting images and negativity that wastes anybody's reading time. In my view, it is impossible to create a work of art out of depressive images, sad emotions and vulgar language. I could not wait until I was able to throw this book down my trash chute. Hope this helps anyone who would think of wasting their valuable time on this piece of trash."
1,Wow..9 whole songs?,"Chock full of songs? Since when do nine songs equate to a compilation CD that is 'chock' full of anything? Oh, and when did Quarterflash become a classic rock band? Did I miss that memo? Blahhhhh!!!!"
2,Pitch Black goes downhill...,"Nah... This is the worst Pitch Black album. Try ""Futureproof"" or ""Pitch Black"", the album, if you want to experience the best of NZ dub-trance. Unfortunately several of the really first rate NZ electronic acts are now insipid and over-commercialised. For Pitch Black and Salmonella Dub, the earlier stuff is definitely the best."
4,No in game saves!,No in game saves! Other than that it looked pretty good. Not one in game saves. That really kind of stinks so this should be on long-car-rides only.
2,Dissapointing,"I bought this game thinking it would be good (because the movie and show are good). I turned ou to be wrong. Its hard to move Jimmy, the worlds are weird, and overall this is not a good game."
4,Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius,"This game is real fun. But has a few minor flaws. The graphics are nice, but the time it takes to beat the game is too short. You could probably beat it in 2 to 4 days. But even though it is still a lot of fun. You have to help Jimmy and Goddard build a rocket, launch into space, repair the rocket, etc. You should try this game and see what you think of it."
1,borrrrrrring!!!,"O.k. this game has good graphics,so what.This is fun at first but you keep having to do missions.And when you think you've gotton somewhere there is another mission,this game makes me want to die!!!"
5,Gotta Blast!,Be Jimmy Neuron and his super spctacular compainon Goddard. Gather enough supills from Reatro City and then fly to the Meteor inthe movie there find the nesesery amount of platonium to get to the planet Youcus and find magneic cards to get past security. See what I mean IT IS COOL!!
2,Fun,"I had only a little fun playing this. I know that most people like it. Well I suggest you buy it if you like game that are challenging, and if you learn fast."
3,Electric Staple Gun,Product is used and in good working condition. The price was supper. Will buy from vendor again. Thanks!
4,Great Artist. Nearly Great Book.,This book is about all there is on this guy. Kudos to Pamela Lee for sticking her neck out and getting a book out on him. It's WAY overdue. At times the analogies and stuff are a bit tiring... though maybe I mowed through it in too much of one sitting.This guy cut up buildings and would jack parts of them up with foundation jacks for chrissakes. Damien Hirst on steriods 20 years early.
3,a glimpse of an all too recent horror,"Wilson's earlier work shows the emergence of the great talent we have enjoyed in the decades since. The attribution of plot elements to mysterious or wondrous but inexplicable things was pretty stock for the 80's and great writers like Orson Scott Card did no better. Wilson has now moved beyond this with interesting and scientifically reasonable plot elements, employed increasingly through to the Spin series, and his popularity has increased deservedly.A Hidden Place is a moving account of the horror of the Depression and the inhumanity that such social upheaval generates in society, an enjoyable novel, all the more so as an indicator of the talent Wilson has become."
2,Dry and pointless,"I love some of Robert Charles Wilson's books, but there are others that seem like you just drove down a dead end street when you finish them up. This is one of those novels. I never really got a good feel for when and where I was, nor did I ever get a good feel for why I cared about the characters, and at the end I didn't see why it mattered what happened to the ""aliens.""There are far better RCW novels to read. Chronoliths and Spin for example."
1,Did not receive,"I received a book I already owned, not this one that I ordered. I'm sure the book is OK as I have enjoyed other books by this author. I just wouldn't order from the vendor again."
4,Saint Julian!,"When it comes down to singersongwriters, Mr. cope is without a doubt my favorite. Brilliant lyrics. Even a more brilliant voice. Julian Cope is nothing short of a genius. Autogeddon is if not his best, then at least his most obscure album (even though Jehovakill comes close). It begins a bit folky, but gradually becomes more and more weird and eventually ends up in a space jam with lots of synths and effects. Yep Saint Julian is one of a kind, his closest resemblance being Nick Cave on acid."
1,Can't Cope,"I am a certified (certifiable?) Copey drood. This album is a real disappointment & sounds like a lot of lazy demos strung together. It's the least appealing of any of his albums. It's worse than Jehovahkill & 20 Mothers. If you really like his ""pop"" side try Interpreter instead - that's a great album."
5,the single best inxs collection - ever,"this is it people. two discs of nothing but their hits and singles. you know when you buy a greatest hits and you really like it but if only they had included just that one song?! well, this has every song you could ever want on it. add the dvd w/ 10 of their videos. this is great too b/c instead of just putting a bunch from one era, it is spaced out. one from each album w/ one exception. (there are 0 from underneath... and 2 from kick.) this is just the ultimate audio and visual testament to inxs. however, if just a single-disc overview is more your thing, then go w/ the definitive inxs, it's much better than the u.s. 'best of.' finally, i disagree w/ the other reviewer. forty bucks sounds like a lot, but it isn't. just keep in mind, you are getting two full length discs and a dvd. that's only 13.50 per disc. and that's for an import. plus free shipping. ok, this is a bargain! trust me, you won't be disappointed."
5,Great oil,This is a great oil with a great scent.It is so pretty too I love glittr in it it is just like the Feary folk:)
4,Unbelievable Stuff,"This was one hell of a ride, a tense cop thriller and an incredible cast, what more could you want? De Niro and Pacino are brilliant as usual and Val Kilmer plays a great role also. The best part has to be the shoot out in the street when a perfectly planned robbery gets foiled and turns the street into a warzone, a part you can watch again and again. And a film which never lets up even until the exciting climax."
5,great movie,"When you watch this bank robbery movie.It is an easy plot similarto western movies.With Deniro's charactor being Jesse James and his gang being Val Kilmer a Billy the Kid charactor and Pacinoas the Wyatt Earp.But there are alot of other great charctors.one of my favs besides Neil(Deniro),Chris(Kilmer),and Vinccent(Pacino)was the tatooed,sociopathic,Max caddy(Cape Fear),wild manof the story WainGro,played brilliantly by Kevin Gage.This guyactually made Deniro and his gang look like the good guys.He wasa standout charactor because Kevin Gage later in his carreer inDee Snyder's Strangeland is a good guy clean cut cop.His talentis way better shown in this great criminal heist flick that iseven good if you watch in on a sick day actually better.A truereward."
2,Warner Brothers Fails Again,"As Mr. Davidson mentioned above, my two stars aren't for the movie which is great, but for Warner Brothers ""cheap"" presentation for this movie. No ""high definition"" transfer, no DTS soundtrack. I'm suprised because Michael Mann has generally stated that he really cares about his movies in the DVD format.The gun battle in this movie is one of the all-time best in movie history and Warner Brothers couldn't do it justice.Do not buy this DVD and waste your money. Maybe one day, somebody at Warner Home Video will care about the consumer and put out a quality product."
2,Great Movie gone bad!,"Ok gang I purchased Heat years ago when It first came out on dvd. This was my all time favorite movie. Michael Manns camera angles and night shots are great the original sound track was great especially the gun fights, helicopter passes and planes at Lax landing. Purchased the blue ray with high hopes. I saw some improvement in the picture, ok not bad, But what the heck happend to the sound track? Its like watching a Japanese Godzilla movie. Very obvious delay in sound track the mouth moves and a second later the word is heard. The shoot outs are worse, you hear a bang and count to 1 and theres the flash. Some one was enjoying to much Jack and Coke while editing this redo! Please fix and send me a new disk or a refund....."
2,Pacino ruins an otherwise brilliant film,"It is amazing how one actor can drag a production that suceeds on every possible level into the gutter, but that is what Pacino manages to do. His screaming, arm waving, tasteless performance is so over the top, and so annoying, than he contaminates the entire movie."
4,The Hunt for the Rice,"""eat nothing that you cannot drop in 5 minutes when you spot thesticky rice on the yum cha trolley""The Sticky would whole heartedly agree with this statement as he watched in absolute fascination as Bob and his chopstick welding crew prepared to rob the biggest cache of rice grains. On their tail is Al, a hard nose cop with a heart of rice.It's a fine line these actors tread in showing what the Sticky Rice really means. Watch out for unforgettable shootout scene when Bob and crew fight their way out of a horde of hawker food owners scrambling to recover the precious rice. And witness the tragic suicide attempt by Natalie Portman as she tries to stuff herself with Swei Mai. It's all delicately directed by the main man himself, Michael Mann, who created such classics as RiceHunter, The Last of the Stick Rice and the Noodle."
2,Michael Mann isn't quite the man....,"The main problem with this movie is that it is too long: all the key events in the movie are stretched too far in between. I realize that the director most likely wanted to present an uber-realistic 3 hours of an epic story, which would also explain the lackluster and ho-hum dialogue. If the director only cut more of the fat, HEAT could have been a worthy addition to the crime-noir genre rather than a see-saw ride from peaks of non-stop firefights to sedative dialogue."
5,A great movie that is even better on blu-ray.,"Seriously, do you ever watch this movie without the anticipation that comes from knowing you are going to watch the greatest cinema gun battle of all time? I didnt think so. Yes, the movie is awesome anyway, but in the back of your mind, you know you are going to see something epic along the way. The blu-ray only serves to make this even more jaw dropping. I recommend this for sure.Enjoy!"
4,"Great movie, sound is a bit off","Can't add much else to this movie after reading the other reviews except 1. The final leg chase is totally realistic; if someone was chasing you with a gun you'd be surprised how far you could run :) 2. The gun play scenes are also realistic; as demonstrated by those 2 bank robbers in CA a while back. 3. The sound is just a hair off from the lip movement in some parts of the DVD but only briefly, a MUST BUY MOVIE for any action fan."
5,The Gold Standard of Cops &Robbers Movies,Third time watching it. Great movie. Pacino and DeNiro at their best. Val Kilmer's second best performance next to Doc Holliday in Tombstone. Rent it in HD...worth the extra buck.
4,Almost Perfect,My big complaint is volume dynamics. There are at least a dozen spots where you dive for the remote to turn down bullets and helicopters or turn up mumbled or manic dialogue. WHY couldn't this be fixed? Both of the principal characters are original and compelling. Their love interests and associates...less so. The cinematography captures the look and feel of L.A. exactly the way I remember it.
3,its ok,"sympathy for a person who kills 100s and Pacino holding his hand in the end ? What for ? Was the villian doing something noble that I would sympathize with him. Acting, direction all good."
5,Great thriller,"Loved the cast. Another De Niro movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Action, suspense a little romance and lots of action. A definite A+ Movie."
5,very good!,"un film bellissimo ed emozionante, sono stata col fiato sospeso per tutta la durata del film. grandissimi i protagonisti!"
5,... OR MAYBE WE WILL NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN ...,"My review will be heavily biased since this is my favorite film. This film has all the elements IMHO of the quintessential crime drama: atmosphere, film-moir undercurrents, note-worthy dialogue and the ruthless cut-to-the-meat discipline. This is an intense movie; light scenes are few and far between and even then, you can feel that the overall mood of the film scorns any suggestion of humor. DeNiro as the master thief and Pacino as the obsessive cop are in perfect tandem with Kilmer,Sizemore and Judd as perfect supporting cast. Sometimes the lines blur between lead and supporting characters as all players in the movie do an excellent job.This is one for any and everyones collection; after all, you might never see Pacino and DeNiro together onscreen again until their apperance in perhaps Celebrity Deathmatch.Enjoy !!!"
5,nothing left to say,i was left speechless after watching this movie. having deniro or pacino on any movie is like a stamp of Quality. it's guaranteed to satisfy you... thank you very much.
5,Superb Acting,"You may need to watch this movie twice before you get a sense of how lucky you are to witness such fine acting - all in one movie! Pacino and DeNiro are at their best in the restaurant scene - just the two of them. When you think of the magnitude of their presence, it should send shivers down your spine. A truly great film and one that deserved better attention from the Academy."
5,"Heat is ""HOT!""","Heat was my first DVD purchase and I couldn't be more pleased. At the risk of repeating what other reviewers have already said, let me say this is a great movie. The performances by De Niro, Pacino, Kilmer and Sizemore are outstanding. This movie also has all the glitter I've come to expect from a Michael Mann film. The DVD format puts you in the middle of the action. Heat is ""HOT!"""
4,Heat,more action and intrigue than you could stand.With this cast a movie could not miss.Pacino/De Niro/Kilmer and Voight really shine. Old story of cops and robbers with a few new twists. Would recommend viewing it.
5,Excellent movie on VHS - can't wait for the DVD,My favorite movie. Excellent movie when running the VCR through the home system. Can't wait for the DVD movie with Dolby Pro Logic.July 27 hurry up
5,Excellent movie you will get attached to forever!,Deniro Pacino Kilmer and the rest of this all star cast puts together a truely griping crime saga filled with action drama and a soundtrack that go together perfectly!
5,Classic of course...,"I agree with most of the reviews so I will not state the obvious...I remember Al Pacino (who lit the screen) saying to comedian Rick Harris ""Give me all you got...Give me all you got""...that was so funny....classic movie.."
2,"Great movie, POOR bluray","I'll keep it simple. The audio and video quality of this Bluray release are the pits. My advice is to buy the regular DVD version, as the quality is much better. The audio of the big gun battle was such a let down on the Bluray, I may never put it in my player again. Whoever mixed this for Bluray oughta be ashamed of themselves!"
3,Ok...not thrilling,"When I ordered Heat on Blu Ray I was hoping to get a high quality transfer. Instead, all I received was a film that had no DTS and extra features in which do not vary from the DVD. Overall the movie is still a classic, but the BluRay was a disappointment. I'm very glad that I did not pay the full retail on this disc as it is not worth it..."
4,Nice add to my Blu-Ray collection,"Fast delivery and nice price. Been a 80's movie don't expect too much Blu-Ray content, the deleted scene are in poor quality and low resolution. The movie is sharp and perfect on 2.35:1 format and 5.1 audio. The product don't even came with a book as other BR. You will only receive the case, the cover and the disc."
3,"Long, but good","Pacino, De Niro, Kilmer, Voight all in one movie. Isn't that great? It is. This cop movie is not bad at all, especially the story and the personalities are well developed.Pacino is sometimes a little too rude and the movie takes too long with 2 hrs and 45 minutes.Still worth seeing if you have the sitting-flesh."
2,Unpleasant characters in a confused and disjointed story,Stopped watching after about thirty minutes. Good actors but unpleasant characters. Pacino's character (the good guy) is particularly obnooxious. Skip it.
1,"Great Movie, when it isn't skipping due to scratches on the disc","Let's see. It arrived on time, A+ for that, put the disc holders inside the Blu Ray case were broken so the disc moved around and put scrathes on the item, so it is impossile to watch without some skipping and pauses while it plays. Bought around 15 DVDs in the past 2 weeks and this has happened to at least 4 of them!!!!!"
3,Copland,"An interesting, though very overrated, policial drama about a wise cop (Al Pacino) and his nemesis (Robert de Niro), ""Heat"" is one of the best movies of its genre produced in the nineties. The plot is somewhat familiar and nothing all that innovative, still director Michael Mann knows how to create a captivating and nocturnal atmosphere, offering some interesting visuals and professionally filmed scenes. The character development is also above average for a movie like this, providing a couple of tense and intriguing moments. It`s also refreshing to watch L.A. at night, making for some worthwile sequences (the climatic conflict, for example). Although good, ""Heat"" runs for way too long, and a three-hour-long movie is not something I would watch much more than once. Still, it`s a solid effort nonetheless and deserves a look, managing to be compelling from beginning to end.A well-told story."
5,FLAWLESS,"I'M 14 YEARS OLD BUT I'VE SEEN ALOT MORE MOVIES THEN YOU THINK. MY FAVORITE GAME IS SIX STEPS TO KEVIN BACON. SOME PEOPLE SAY I WATCH TOO MANY MOVIES, AND I DO SO YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME ON THIS. tHIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC. THE CAST IS GREAT (DENIRO, PACINO,KILMER.) IT'S ABOUT A LAPD OFFICER TRACKING DOWN A PROFESSIANAL ROBBER. THIS MOVIE HAS GREAT ACTION, AND DRAMA, AS WELL AS SOME SUSPENSE. tHIS IS A MUST-SEE FOR EVERYONE. THIS ONE'S A KEEPER. ADD THIS TO YOUR DVD COLLECTION RIGHT AWAY."
4,"good movie, great acting!","This movie has some intense, powerful,extraordinary scenes (the bank holdup, the street getaway scene or the Pacino-De Niro first and only scene together in the movie). But the best thing about ""Heat"" is the acting and these two guys in particular, De Niro and Pacino; imagine for an instant these two characters played by, let's say, Bruce Willis and Schwarzie: would you still love it so much? I really hope these two great actors will have the chance to make another movie together in the future!"
1,"Decent video, horrible audio transfer......","I was so excited to get this Blu Ray. I LOVE this movie but was extremely disappointed. The video transfer is great, but the audio just flushes it down the toilet. There is no consistency between the sound effects and the voices. The dialog seems muffled and drowned out.It's very difficult to understand what the characters are saying. The sound effects such as explosions and gunshots are very loud and I was constantly adjusting the volume to my AV receiver. I agree with other reviewers on this terrible Blu Ray transfer that ruins a Fantastic movie. Hopefully a new release down the road will fix the audio issues."
3,"Great movie, so so blu-ray","Just my opinion on the blu-ray. I have the movie, which is great in its own rights, in DVD, and the blu-ray is not much of an improvement over the DVD. Both picture and sound qualities are only marginally better than the DVD, and subpar to many other blu-rays. You won't miss much skipping this blu-ray."
2,The DVD is Better,"This is a great movie, but a terrible blu-ray disk, and a bad release.The audio is fine, but the video is awful. The focus is completely off in some scenes. In a few places, the video visibly jumps in and out of focus. In other places, the background noise is more animated than the foreground action. The DVD release up-sampled to 1080p is actually better looking than this disk.Even without that, several memorable lines have been removed from this version, with editing that makes it pretty obvious in at least one place.Disappointing."
5,"Action-packed, with great character development.","I agree with the majority of reviewers. This is a first-class, intense film with generally excellent portrayals (one exception is Pacino's over-the-top acting, mentioned by another writer). One interested fact: After watching this, I went home and watched several episodes of the old tv show ""Crime Story"". Many of the scenes from 'Heat' were lifted straight out of the tv show, (including the scene where Pacino catches his wife with another man, then leaves with his tv set; even the dialogue is the same). Nonetheless, well worth owning, suitable for mutliple viewings, and will give your 5.1 surround a real workout!"
5,Great Movie!!!!!,"This movie is great. The video is crisp and the audio, well I only have Prologic so.... I must admit, if for no other reason, I bought this movie because Ashley Judd is in it. I just think she is gorgeous.The movie was full of action, although it does have a few slow spots that are tolerable. I like Robert De Niro more than Al Pacino and Val Kilmer is cool. My only complaint about the movie, NOT ENOUGH ASHLEY."
2,Why does everyone think this movie so great?,"I bought this DVD because it was a bestseller and had so many great reviews. Not to mention the great actors in this movie. But this movie blows. It falls short in so many areas i wonder if the reviewers have ever seen a good movie. Way to long, only 1 good long action scene, and the ending has to be one of the worst ever. There was no suspense in the Pacino/DeNiro face off it was so damn boring i fast forwarded it till someone got shot. Seriously people rent this DVD before you watch it star power alone doesn't make a movie good."
2,very average,much like with Harlem Nights that had Richard Pryor&Eddie Murphy i was all hyped to see it and it was not to good.well the same goes here i thought wow! De Niro&Pacino? but this film is long winded and over the top.considering the talent here it's a very average film.
4,Al Pacino + Robert De Niro= Awesome movie! (4 1/2 stars),"Heat is a masterpiece starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, and Tom Sizemore. Al Pacino is a cop trying to nail De Niro and his gang of robbers who are robbing banks. Pacino and De Niro are absolutely brilliant with two powerhouse performances. It's a rare thing to see actors this good in 1 movie. That alone makes it worth watching but the movie itself is a classic. It has one of the best scenes of all time in which a bank robbery turns into an amazing shootout. Bullets fly everywhere and lots of cops die in this classic scene. The movie is very long actually but even though it seems very long at times, 90% of it flew by for me. The ending is good but what you will remember is that awesome shootout!I'm giving it 4 1/2 stars because of its length!"
2,BETTER PICTURE? NO,"If you're thinking about buying this 2 disc version to get a better DVD picture transfer; don't bother. I couldn't tell a difference from the original release, which is good but could be much better.Only buy this if you're interested in the special features."
5,Wow.,"Gee,What can I say?Almost 4 years this movie released and I still love to watch it. The gunfight scene is cool, lack of usual Hollywood silly add ons and the acting of the characters is good. Al Pacino is a bit overacting but considering his circumstances, it is hardly suprising.My only minor complaint is the female characters is bit lacked in depth but heck this movie is about cop and robber story not female bonding. All in all, one of the classic movie."
5,The Best in every aspect,"I have never seen a great movie than this.The pace is great,the storyline is fantastic and it keeps u guessing till the end how it ever ends.Well Of course its Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.A* list actors with a cool sense.I am glad to have watched this on DVD.Its great.The picture us clear and perfect.The sound,5.1, makes you jump out of your seat.Somehow, whenever a Warner Bros dvd is released,it always has better sound and picture quality then other dvd producer(giving sony entertainment an exception).If you have yet to watch,this is highly recommended.Its a movie that is released once in a lifetime."
4,"Beautifully shot, lacking in emotions in places",Unmistakably Michael Mann. Beatifully shot. I felt I was watching a long running music video (music is great btw) which is not necessarily a bad thing. The infamous fight sequence in the streets is impressive and engaging and the movie does a good job (I assume Mann was shooting for this) of leaving enough compassion for the villains that you still remain engaged in their world. My only beef is the relationship between Deniro's character and his love interest just came off as unreal. I'll place the blame on the female actress's head. It's a minor beef but the movie as a whole would have engaged me more with this problem elminated.
3,"Great film, lousy DVD transfer","This is probably one of the finest crime films ever. There is a certain coolness & style in this film that only Michael Mann knows how to pull off. Heat is a movie that will reward multiple viewings, there is no way that you will keep track of all the details in one viewing. The three star rating is a reflection of the DVD quality, the visuals are not clean & the audio is far to muffled & soft, I found myself using the subtitles. I watch my films on a very decent home theater, so you can trust my opinion regarding DVD quality."
4,My favorite Michael Mann movie,"My 18 year old son and his 60 year old dad both love this movie. The casting is just about perfect - especially Robert DeNiro in a ""sympathetic"" role as a criminal. Al Pacino is also outstanding as a flawed but determined cop. Michael Mann does an excellent job of distilling LA both visually and geographically."
3,Not Much To Say,"Maybe I need to go watch this a couple more times, but after seeing it I just wasn't that impressed. I'm not saying it is bad, but it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting a power crime/mob drama like ""Casino"" and that likes of it. For me, this movie was not it. I say rent it before you buy it."
2,pretentious crap with good acting,"I was so excited to see this film and found it a big boring disappointment. What a waste of acting talent, and what sophmoric, showoffy, directing and writing. Real piece of crap."
3,pretty good gangster melodrama,"While there is nothing original or fascinating about this film, it is very good for passing the time, in particular the action is far better than average. I enjoyed the masterful professional thieves, their self-imposed discipline of leaving in 30 seconds, and their physicality in violence. The subtheme of good/bad guy resembling eachother is also fun, particularly the Pacino/Niro meeting and open conversation. It is much better than average.But what can you say about the plot? A heist, maybe the big one, is coming. Get em or get away with it. Then there are the girls, the anchor we all seek. In an obsessed life, there is little room for love, except as castoff entertainment or broken promises. Fine, but does it rise above that kind of formula? No, in my view.Recommended, but not as a film I would love to watch again and again and again. It is well worth a viewing, perhaps, but alas will not join the classics by any stretch of the imagination."
3,The problem with Waingro,"This film had great promise that was never fufilled. It has excellent actors but the plot and subplots never develop in a satisfying way. It's like the script bit off more than it could chew. The most interesting and engaging character is Waingro played by Kevin Gage. He did a super job with this part, and if it had been better written he may have been nominated for an acting award. There is a hint of a subplot that goes no where. The way in which Waingro kills a hooker is poorly thought out and unrealistic. It is a theme that runs through this film. DeNiro/Pacino ok but no attention to detail, too many subplot deadends and lack development of the most interesting character (Waingro) sinks this flick. Too bad it could have been great. Explosions and shoot outs are the best parts along with Waingro."
1,Am I the only one who did not like this movie?,"maybe my expectations were too high but I thought this was a huge disappointment. The action scenes were not exciting and I don't think they really did a good job with the story. That whole scene where DeNiro and Pacino are in the restaurant talking seemed so contrived I just could not buy it. Maybe with some more judicious editing I would have a different opinion, but I can't reccomend this film to anyone."
1,an awful waste of some incredible acting talent,"Al Pacino,Robert DeNiro,John Voight...You'd think with actors as great as these (along with such talents as Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) this movie would be put in the hands of a brilliant director.Martin Scorsese?Nope.Sidney Lumet?Wrong.John Frankenheimer(R.I.P)?Think again.Sadly,this movie was directed by the guy who did Miami Vice.This movie is built more like a TV crime drama-with many plots going on at once-than a great crime film.And then I see Henry Rollins on the phone with DeNiro.Okay,I can take that.But Tone Loc sharing screen time with Al Pacino???Who did the casting for this film?Carson Daly??Trust me,instead of this incredibly over-rated waste of celluloid,check out the very under-rated ""Carlito's Way""."
1,Extreme Borefest,I am a huge fan of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. I had heard nothing but great reviews about this film.There are so many characters to keep track of and seemingly so many different stories going on aside from the main story that I wish I had a pad and paper to keep track of it all.A seasoned criminal who becomes lonely and tries to find love. A cop who can't devote enough time to his wife as she would like. A recently released ex-con who doesn't like his job at a diner. That ex-con's woman who tries to keep him motivated. A daughter who has a hissy-fit because she can't find a pair of hair clippers that match her outfit. The list goes on and on. Too many side stories that pointlessly make this film an hour or more longer then it needed to be.A classic example of how an all-star cast does not guarantee an all-star film.
1,Michael Mann's Theme,"Somebody, maybe Pauline Kael, talked about the pornography of violence. In that sense, Michael Mann makes pornographic films: very hard guys, very lovely women, very little dialog, and lots of automatic weapons fire and spattering blood sacks for the jaded audience. No actual humans need be portrayed, no actual interaction is therefore required; just pretty people banging away. Only Mann's films, pretending to be something other than what they are (not sure what, though), go on forever. At least porn's unpretentious and quick. Honest. Give it a try. Rent something XXX and compare it with ""Heat."" You'll see."
1,No collision,"It's really troubling to see all the reviewers talk about how great Pacino and De Niro are together, when actually there is only one scene they share.Moreover, the two probably were never even on the set at the same time, as the coffee scene is shot in singles and over the shoulders. Now wouldn't any director, if he had the chance (even one as stupid as Michael Mann) die to have at least one shot where we could show these two giants together? So each actor was shot separately with probably a stand-in or the script girl reading the lines of the other."
1,"It's a four-letter word, all right","The Good - Al Pacino versus Robert DeNiroThe Bad - Val KilmerThe Ugly - A Michael Mann filmAnd the winner is...no drum roll needed here...the ugly. Michael Mann can't stop sucking. No surprise there.We begin with minimal dialogue and exposition through words, a MM trademark. Then they did finally ""act"" and were howlingly bad, another MM trademark. The writing, the delivery, and the overblown ""action"" scenes. Give me a medal for lasting 15 minutes. Okay, 10. It felt like many more. Please, MTV, give MM a job before he films again."
5,The Greatest movie of all time,"I could go on & on but i will spare you.Put simply this movie is the greatest,if you love a tense action thriller with dialogue as exciting as the action itself then this is the film for you.I live in hope that one day Warner will re-issue this DVD as a special edition."
3,Great Movie subpar DVD transfer.,"I think Heat is a great movie, but the DVD trannsfer was not that great. The picture quality was nothing special, but the sound was terrible. The effects track was alot louder than the dialogue and the bass track was absent in all the scenes except for the scene at the airport where the bass track seemed to be way too high. I'm sure I'll love the extras, but the DVD was a lackluster transfer."
4,Burnin Heat!,This was a collosal movie that I was tired of hearing about so i purchased it and I was not let down excellent stuff! De Niro and Paccino instant classic!
4,"I Liked This Movie, But...","My son-in-law talked me into watching this movie, and I must admit that it's quite good. De Niro is at his best as a meticulous if not obsessed criminal, and Pacino is his usual excellent self as an equally obsessed law enforcement officer. The supporting cast, including Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, and Tom Sizemore all turn in good performances. Amy Brenneman was somewhat underutilized, and her rather insignificant part in this movie made me wonder why she was even cast in the first place.One only needs to spend a few minutes with this movie to know that it's a Michael Mann production. The visuals, attention to detail, the pacing, and music are all trademarks of Mann's. The plot, unfortunately, is somewhat derivative of one of Mann's earlier movies, the excellent and underrated ""Thief"", starring James Caan, Jim Belushi, and Willie Nelson.Overall, this is a very good movie that could have been greater with a more beefed-up plot."
2,Why I am unsatisfied with my purchase.,"Movie is top drawer, but the 2nd tape jumps all the way thru. The jumping is a pain in the butt, but I'll keep it because I don't want to pay anymore to get it replaced. It was new when I bought it & I have watched it 3 times, and always regret having bought it. It's a shame the movie that is new has to come with one of the tapes defective. If I knew I wouldn't have to pay more $$$ I would have returned it. Every time I watch the movie, I regret having spent $$$ on it. Guess I'll have to buy DVD's from now on. Darn shame. Ralph Sherrow 510-397-0951"
3,"Decent movie, DVD","Heat has two of the greatest actors ever in it, but the movie isn't one of the best ever. I still thought it was O.K. The DVD provides average picture and sound, but no extras. If you like action films, it's worth it."
3,Mediocre,"Heat did not have to be a lot of the things that it was, or have the things that it had. For instance, it didn't have to be three hours long. There were a lot of extra scenes that could have easily been left out, or cut shorter. Al Pacino did a great job (as always), and De Niro did well with what they gave him to work with, which wasn't great. Val Kilmer was not needed to play his part, as was the same situation with Ashley Judd's character, and with Jon Voight's. For a better Michael Mann film, see The Insider. Heat was fine to watch once. It had its good elements, but not enough to spend another three hours for a second viewing. It is not something that kids would enjoy, and its R rating is due to violence and language."
1,"full screen dvd's HEAT, CASINO ROYALE & BAD BOYS 2","I just did a search on the full screen dvds for HEAT and you have it listed under the full screen. I ordered this dvd and had to send it back because your advertising was misleading. Please correct this problem so it doesn't disappoint other customers. When will HEAT be available in full screen? If you cannot accommodate, please provide me with someone who can!"
2,What... is everyone afraid to say anything bad about a film with Pacino/DeNiro?,"Actually, the acting was close to perfect, and all roles were developed nicely, so kudos for casting (but how can you miss with this cast???). The big weaknesses here were the plot and the direction. These were very sophomoric. Seriously... right down to the last scene. Predictable. I actually guessed the last line in the movie right after the coffee house scene. Plot and screenplay were very poor. Unoriginal. Cinematography was uninspired. Actually... a bad movie made no more than 'OK' by a stellar cast.Ok. I watched this movie again a few days ago... and I have to say it. This movie sucks."
4,Daylight robbery.,"Excellent Character study and development,spot-on editing,well Written and Directed,Impressive all-round performances,especially by the leads,De-Niro and Pacino.Pacino plays an L.A.cop,who lives by a manic obsession for his job,De-Niro plays a master thief,who lives also by a total dedication,and the ultimately fatal rule of ""one more job"".Some great,memorable scenes including:The after-robbery shoot-out in broad daylight,and the unforgettable final chase,means ""Heat"" exceeds far above the usual empty headed spectacle,and emerges a winner,in every respect.*4.5 for the film. Picture quality:Excellent.Could not find any faults at all,in any form.Original Aspect Ratio,2.35:1.*4.5/5. Sound quality:Again,no problems.The after-robbery shoot-out inparticular,totally mindblowing.*4.5/5.Overall,Great film and presentation/sound.For the price,expecting more extras than three trailers would have been a crime,in fact it would have been robbery,daylight robbery."
5,It has a flawless plot. Nothing superfluous.,I'll keep it short and sweet. This is Michael Mann's best work. Followed very closely by The Last Of The Mohicans. This movie has impecable character development and heart-stopping action. Contains the best gun-fight action sequence ever recorded on film.
3,Heat,Heat was a good movie. DeNiro is a good actor. I enjoyed it and would recommend it again to others.
4,"Great Movie, but dont get sucked into bad BD releases","Thanks to one of the many top reviews on this Blu-Ray, I will NOT be buying. Nothing is more upsetting than the movie studios trying to plug Blu-Ray quality, while actually giving us crap uprezzed DVD, and then crapping on us some more as Americans (a la. SOPA / PIPA) by strangling our laws. Thanks much for the review, I will be passing on this, as much as it saddens me as this film is awesome."
4,Good Story but Predictable Ending,"It seems all movies of this type always end in a shootout between the good guy and the bad guy, with the good guy winning. A surprise ending would have made this a 5-star movie. Otherwise, you have good acting, lots of action, captivating plot."
4,A movie that keeps you in suspense,"I am not a big Al Pacino or Robert De Niro fan but both play really good roles in this movie, Heat. Very suspenseful with lots of action and keeps your attention well from beginning to the end. There is a lot of violence as well and would not call it a family movie. Even though it is 15 years old, it might still be one of the best combined action/suspense movies I have seen. If you like mystery/crime films with a ton of action, then be sure to watch it if you have not already.Peter J. Miller"
4,Awesome movie!,"DeNiro, and Pacino together in one movie. Enough said. Buy this movie if you like explosions and gunplay."
4,A 90's Thief,"Michael Mann came to the big screen with ""Thief"" in 1981. Very similar heist story, independent pro ""undone"" by becoming emotionally entangled. Very different ending, though. If you liked ""Heat"" for the story and the genre, you should check out ""Thief""."
1,Skip the Blu-Ray for now,"As other reviewers have noted here, this Blu-Ray (unfortunately like Miami Vice, also from director Michael Mann) lacks the crisp HD picture detail that the Blu-Ray format should have on every title. Once you've seen a good Blu-Ray (think Public Enemies, Fight Club or 2001), then watching a sub-par one is that much more disappointing.Maybe the studios think we're daft in the head, that they can churn out Blu-Ray titles that lack true HD picture and we won't notice the difference until they can then issue a remastered version for yet another unit sale. Since the DVD format is going away, there's a lot of this going around it seems. Skip this version unless you really don't care what it looks like. This is a great film. It deserves better than this."
4,A Keeper. A real value worth owning on DVD,"I waited on the arrival of a DVD with extras beyond the old, featureless format. Mann's commentary is one of the best I've heard. These were always interesting characters but Mann reveals that a lot of work went into the development of each of them. A lot of the psychology behind the characters and the movie is explained. Some of the extras include real police interviews that were used as consultants for the script. One complaint: the deleted scenes seem incomplete as if the front and back ends were cut short. Two scenes with Sizemore seem a waste. One where he's in a toy store checkout, the other when he's at a daycare. Not clear where these scenes would have fit into the movie. Most deleted scenes should stay that way in my opinion. Deleted for good reasons. Each are short. A ""PLAY ALL"" feature would have been nice."
5,Best movie I have ever seen.,"This movie has the best scene ever directed. Al Pacino and Robert Deniro in my opinion work together to make this the best film they have ever made. Throw in Val Kilmer and you have one awesome flick that you will watch more than once, guaranteed!"
5,Best of '95,"This movie is easily the best of 1995.Both pacino and De Niro are on top form in this slick re-working of Manns earlier ""La Takedown"".The camera work is outstanding and the bank robbery shoot-out was superbly choreographed. FULL MARKS!"
3,Sometimes drags but worth the wait,"Deniro Kilmer,and Sizemore are great, but Pacino's wierd performance almost ruins the movie. Someone who acts that goofy would not be a high-ranking police officer.As usual, the main black character played by Mikelti Williamson is written as not as smart as his white colleagues."
2,Pachino is awful,"What could have been a brilliant film is turned into a mess by Al Pachino and his PCP addict-like performance. He shows no restraint as he screams, kicks and waves his arms at the most inopportune moments, and to a degree that makes Chris Farley look reserved"
2,old things,"Why would anyone bother playing an old football game for a gaming system that was never successful in the first place? This is a pretty bad game. I'm not exactly the biggest fan of football video games (I am, however, a HUGE fan of watching the sport on TV every Sunday) but wanting to seek out this game for your Sega Game Gear is totally not worth it. The NFL has been upgraded since this game was released and now it's MUCH bigger and better. Check out the brand new Madden '07 for the Playstation 3 to see what a drastic improvement is like."
1,"Pompous, Overblown, Long-Winded and Meandering...","...and the book wasn't all that great either.In this novel the locally esteemed NYC ethnic author Edgardo Vega Yunque de Soto Manheim von Richtofen attempts to achieve a sort of surrealistic experience reminiscient of later Marquez...and fails. His ""zany"" team of Freudians reads like a watered down bit of Joe Heller that a decent editor would have snipped. The story is meandering and disconnected and the prose is so mannered and purposefully arched that it takes the reader right out of the story. The pompous prose distracts from the rest of the book.I won't be reading any further Yunque novels. If you want to read Marquez, then read Marquez and not this watered down attempt to emulate him."
5,One of my favorite books!,"I have several of Emilie Barnes' books, but this is one of my favorites. The illustrations are magnificent, the thoughts and ideas are lovely, and I was so entranced by the book, I didn't put it down until I had looked over every page. Her ideas for gift giving were special and easy to do, which makes this a great book for anyone who loves gardening."
4,Does good clips for my groups,I crossdress and do a lot of flashing and upskirting-I use the video camera to take clips of me and put then in my groups-they have a small file size-I can get about 20-25 second clips in less than 1 meg-I would recomend this camera to anyone who wants to email clips or put them in communities or groups-Also small enough it can be set up and not really be noticed
3,a smart user,"Drugs do not give us different minds. They do something to our minds to change our perspective of the world. Andrew Weil knows this; but so does any intelligent person who takes a mind altering substance with the goal of understand his or her own mind. Dr. Weil wrote this book when he was a young man traviling from the U.S. all the way down the Americas. His journey is to better understand how different cultures and people use pychoactive substances to change their lives. He begins with native americans in the Dakota's and finishes with tribesman in South America. Many of his observations are valuable, such as the role eclipses mankind's evolution; and many are questionable, such as the value of self-induced vomiting. Recommended for young person's and person's inexperienced with psychoactive substances who want a little education from a intelligent user. Many of us however might find Dr. Weil's first book -The Natural Mind- to be more enlightening."
5,gripping mystery novel about murder in the family,"This novel is Kate Floras first mystery novel. Thestory centers around a young woman, whose sisteris suddenly murdered. She decides to investigate onher own, and in doing so must go to the town whereher younger, adopted sister had been murdered toexamine the life of her sister, the associates andboyfriends. Not only does she have to work on themystery, but she also has her own thriving businessand a couple of men in her life to deal with. This novelis not merely a mystery novel, for it doesn't merelycenter on the mystery at hand, but also on the life of thesister left behind in the tragedy. I highly recommendthis novel if you want more than just the averagemystery! Its gripping at times, humourous, engaging,and has a very unexpected ending that even leftme surprised!! The author writes along the lines ofMary Higgins Clark or Gloria murphy...great reads"
4,Met Kate in The Writer's Chatroom - found a new author to read,"I met Kate Flora in The Writer's Chatroom and bought this book.I liked the main character and the story line was very engaging. At times I wanted to climb inside the book and shake the birth mother of the MC's adopted sister. And the landlady, oh, don't get me started!Great Read! I am on the second of this series and am enjoying it as well.Kate Flora has a new fan."
4,Enjoyable Escape,"Hated to put it down. Had to read the last couple of chapters over 'cus I read through them so fast to find out what was gonna happen next. It's challenging to find a mystery that has a giggle/zinger. This one was ""salted & peppered"" to my taste."
2,Disappointing,"If attention to details is what separates excellent mystery authors from good ones, Pence may be doomed to the latter category. I found at least two story line contradictions in this book that were quite distracting as I tried to figure out who done it. It is a fun read with some sensual scenes between our heroine (Angie Amalfi) and her boyfriend thrown in to move the across book love story line along. It wasn't what I was looking for, but others may enjoy it."
2,Not as good as the first installment of this series.,"While I am enjoying this book at bit, I am not enjoying it nearly as much as the first book in this series. I am wishing that the next books are better than this one."
3,Romantic but Annoying,"The mystery is intriguing here, even if the wrap-up left a little something to be desired. The backstory in this book also shows promise on Pence's part- it certainly adds a more romantic air to this romance/mystery. Unfortunatly, Angie seems contradictory here- sometimes thoughtful, other times jumping to outrageous petty conclusions in Pence's attempt to work some conflict between the lovers. Angie's character I think goes downhill from here- Cooking Most Deadly is the next book."
3,A SOMEWHAT RUN-OF-THE-MILL CONTEMPORARY JAZZ RECORDINGS OF THE 90's WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 3 (THREE) CUTS,"Those being: ""While My Lady Sleeps"", ""Circular Norton"", and ""Naima"". Which could be the main reason why collectors are paying top dollar for this album (Compact Disc). These 3 (Three) cuts are on hit!. Produced by Walter Becker (Of The Becker Brothers)."
3,good harmonies but their weakest cd of the sixties,"The hollies never put out a bad cd in the sixties ever. This to me was their weakest and it gets three stars from me! The band signature harmonies are there butunlike other cd's from them it's hitless and as one reviewer said they needed to pick other dylan songs. I don't know what idiot thought that a wonderful group like the hollies shouldn't be allowed to record dylan though, some dumb critic of the day probably? However they do a decent job here but compared to their other sixties releases including their earliest ones It's just not as fun to me as what they put out right up to 1974 at least. I would say that this is for hollies fans but get other releases first before you grab this one."
4,Fusion that endures,"This recording is the beginnings of what was to become Steps. Michael Brecker, God rest his soul never made a bad recording and this is worth buying for the tune, ""I'm Sorry"" alone. The intro still brings tears to me eyes. There's a little bit everyone's compositions including Randy Brecker's eccentric funk, and Manieri's lyricism. I believe that drummer, Steve Jordan was around 19 or 20 at the time of this concert and still a phenom in the world of jazz-fusion. Tony Levin holds down the bottom and Warren Bernhardt contributes nicely on keyboards. I could live w/o Larry Coryell's cameo. He's not one of my favorite guitarists, but he only appears on one tune."
3,GOOD!! BUT NOT GREAT,"UPON RECIEVING THE NEW ALBUM, THE EXCITEMENT, THE ANTICIPATION MADE ME RIP THE PLASTIC OFF AND PLAY THE CD IMMEDIATELY. ONLY TO BE A BIT DISSAPOINTED. IT LACKS THE EXCITEMENT, THE HOOKS THAT MADE SKELOTON JAR SO DAMN GOOD. DON'T GET ME WRONG, THE SONGWRITING IS GOOD, MUSICIANSHIP IS GREAT BUT IT'S SO'OOOOOOOOOO SLOW. FIRST HALF OF THE RECORD WAS GREAT BUT THE SECOND HALF SLOWS DOWN WAY TOO MUCH(SONGS LIKE ""DAISY CHAIN"", ""SORRY"", ""TJ""... DRAG A BIT. TO TOP IT OFF WHY WOULD THEY INCLUDE ""FOREVER YOUNG"" THE SONG HAS BEEN OUT FOR A LONG TIME. NOT A GOOD CLOSING SONG AND TO BE HONEST THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THAT SONG. MAYBE IN THE 4TH ALBULM THEY'LL RETURN WITH SKELETON JAR PART 2. PLEASE!!!!"
4,Outstanding songwriting maturity!,"Forever young was a remake of Alphavilles 1984 tune and didnt take long to make an imprint on your mind. With a more melancholic vocal it is a relatively faithful version. It was however a slight aberation, though catchier than head lice in a kindergarten, it was requested of the band through acquaintances for inclusion in the tv show The OC. So dont expect this Sydney indie quartet to produce more 1980's covers. Similiar in feel, though far better, String and Dead Zoo are surpassed only by the sensational Start Today Tomorrow. With influences from Dylan to Tom Petty to The Pet Shop Boys this is jangly guitar based pop. Under The Underpass and Catching & Killing both rock out hard to create balance. This CD will long be remembered above all else for its outstanding songwriting maturity."
5,"I said, ""Amen.""","I am an educated Pentecostal, with degrees in theology and ministry. I have pastored in Pentecostal churches, and I have always held that speaking in tongues is the initial, physical evidence of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. I taught this position for years to hundreds of people. However, Dr. Walston has changed my view. I cannot begin tell you how big of a shift this is for me. This is big. Very big. I was asked to read Dr. Walston's book by a friend of mine so that I could dismantle Walston's argument. So, I began reading the book. I noted that on each point where he and I disagreed, I bristled at his statements. However, the more I read, the more I realized that it was my ""tradition"" that I felt like I was trying to protect. As I let my mind rule my emotions, and I really ""listened"" to Dr. Walston's exegesis point for point, I found myself agreeing more and more, until finally, I closed the book after reading the last page, and I said, ""Amen."""
5,"Theological, Logical, Persuasive and Convincing","I bought ""The Speaking in Tongues Controversy"" because so many of my colleagues (Classical Pentecostals, Assemblies of God) were discussing it. Some said that the book made a lot of sense while others disagreed. Personally, I found Walston's arguments to be theologically astute, logically argued, persuasive, and, finally, utterly convincing. I must admit, I came into this study with my mind already made up the other way, and I was amazed at the fact of my transformation. I think Dr. Denny Nissley (on the back cover of the book) said it very well for me (and some of my colleagues): ""Dr. Walston has thrown a 'big wrench' into my tongues-as-evidence doctrinal gears. I am now working through what I thought was a foundational doctrine that I also thought was settled long ago."" Kudos to Walston for taking this biblical stand in spite of the flap (and grief) that he has gotten from his Pentecostal brethren."
5,Gabe's review,"This book was fast-paced, informative, and enjoyable. Which ever stand you take on tongues this book is a great reed.Gabe at www.eastharbor.org"
4,Good for Thinking Pentecostals,"I read the book and at first, I must admit, it challenged my Pentecostal position. However, after reading it again, I have found that it helped me fine-tune my position some more. His basic arguments are sound, but his conclusions can be challenged quite well."
4,Great.,"The album is wonderful. No scratches, everything works perfectly. However, the one I received is mislabeled (perhaps I didn't read the description close enough). Side A is Side B and vice versa. Certainly doesn't ruin the album, just feel I had to mention it."
4,Well worth the money,"I stored my car last year without a battery maintainer and my battery died even in a heated garage. In order to avoid the same issues this year I did some research on a few products based on personal and website reviews and decided to with go the BatteryMinder...I wasn't disappointed. Once the battery is charged to 14 volts the BatteryMinder can be swtiched to maintain by a push of button, maintenance doesn't get much easier or carefree. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because the instructions to use are not very detailed."
4,Great idea and price with one design flaw,"I have known about desulphation since the '60s but never did anything about it. But I have a couple of standby batteries for power failures and a boat motor and realized that they were pooping out too easily. I was really pleased to find inexpensive products (I thought I would be building my own). My old long-storage trickle chargers are now in a box counting down to discard status. One thing I don't like at all is that the desulphator circuit keeps running in a power failure which of course discharges the batteries. I am going to need to set up a cutout relay to deal with the event that I might not be home when the power fails and don't want this charger to waste the reserve. It's annoying to need to do that myself, obviously a cutout should have been built in."
5,gotta have one of these!!,this unit is the best thing I've ever bought for my many toys with batteries!! I fact I've bought 6 of them in the last year. My Harley mechanic says it's the only way to keep a battery fresh over the long winter storage months in Iowa. I have not done an amp draw study so I don't know what they all are costing me in electricity. Still love them!!!!!!!!
5,Does what it says!,I revived many old and worn out lead acid batteries with this product. It has been running for a year or so non-stop without issue. Highly recommended!
2,Minder is not perfect,"I don,t know if my unit is defective but it cooks all the water out of my 12 volt motorcycle battery, if I leave it hooked up for when I,m not riding it."
4,Great before Sandy. Will know better after a winter of outdoor storage,"Seemed to be working when I left it attached to my outdoor-stored vehicle before leaving for Florida. Power has been out since Sandy, and so I will not know how well the Batteryminder works until I return to the car next Spring."
1,bad,"I received it not working, I had to return it and buy something else locally from walmart, I don't recommend it to anyone."
1,Not the best choice. Warranty is useless.,"Mine went bad, in just under a year, sent back and they denied the warranty, because ""it had corroded inside"". I suppose if you use poor quality parts and solder in side they will all do this. Mine was in a garage (unheated), minding a battery on my favorite sports car. I bought it, now paid to ship it back for repair. - All $$$ are LOST, since it's completely broken."
5,Super Awesome Work Horse,"Been using this minder for several months now. Ran several tests and I am happy as a lark. Would I recommend it, or buy one again? Absolutely - worth every red cent paid.Ships quickly - great communication from the merchant and packaging was great.This minder has been working non-stop since I received it - and it shows no sign of slowing down."
4,"Seems to work as advertised, but support is lacking","This BatteryMINDer was just what I was looking for, to charge, desulfate, and winter maintain batteries such as in a small generator and scooter. However, submitted a a query regarding operation via email and never received a response."
3,Buyer beware,"Bought the Sony brand Memory Stick PRO Duo (genuine MSX M2GS) for my Sony webcam and it worked fine however, the adapter that is supposed to make the stick compatable with MS Pro readers/devices does not always work as advertised; specifically, my Dell XPS 1710 laptop's card reader. The MS Pro Duo w/adapter does function in my cheap little USB card reader and so no loss there but the transfer speeds are a bit slow... been around the block with Dell over this issue and their answer is that my XPS's card reader is only compatable with MS Pro (and other) sticks ONLY and it does work fine there... Sony gives me no response, go figure."
1,Order that I have not received,"I ordered this memory stick Pro duo on 12/13/2007 as a X'mas gift for my daughter, she bought a Sony Cyber shot Digital Camera couple days before, I'd just hope that it would arrive in time. It was so disappointed I hadn't received the stick by now. I was so sorry that she missed some of her good memory during the holiday."
2,First Product was misrouted and then arrived late,I was not able to collect the item as it was sent to wrong address and then later by the time it arrived I left USA.
5,"Great product, no problems","Good little memory stick. Currently using as memory for a digicam, and no problems so far. For me, Sony is a highly trusted company when it comes to small electronics and this memory only reinforces that opinion. Have yet to try it in a system that requires long, continuous access (i.e PSP) but I'm sure it will work splendidly."
5,Great memory stick,"Good size memory stick. Perfect to take a lot of pictures and even get some high quality video. If you plan to use your camera to record a lot of video I recommend to buy a larger memory stick. Other than that, no complaints."
5,Does what it should,"I've had no issues with this card yet. Though I have noticed that either it, or my camera, tends to lag after a certain amount of pictures are saved to it.Beyond that, it's fine. Never lost a picture, holds a good amount, and is lovely over-all. Write speed is good, as well, though sometimes, the lagging.Oh the lagging."
5,Different,"There are some reviews I have read which are critical in some way of a product, and this helps me to consider purchasing it. I like to read the people who are unhappy with the product. I've only had this a short time, and I haven't any complaints. So I won't read my review! Will update later if there is a problem."
4,Great Product,Its a great product for PSP memory use. You can store so much files and save different games stuffs.
3,Cool Memory Stick,"Como comprador Sony, prefiero comprar los productos de la misma marca, pero el mismo tipo de ""Memory Stick"" de otra marca tiene el mismo rendimiento por un precio inferior."
3,Sony only,"I'm new to the digital camera age, so I wasn't aware that this memory stick only works with Sony products. I was able to return it without any problem, but beware that this won't work with any product but a Sony."
5,No more worries about space,"I used to have 4 memory sticks of the old ones with my old cybershot, but with a purchase of a new camera I decided to buy only 1, but a very large one...I have taken many many shots and videos in high res and I have downloaded them to my computer and I cant complain, its very fast, reliable and no problems whatsoever. I recommend it if you are a user who takes many many shots..."
5,Worth the money...,"Remembering the saga, 'buying cheap and paying twice', too well, I chanced on the largest Memory Stick Pro Duo available. I have not regretted my decision after using it with my Sony DSC-W100 digital camera.The 8,1-megapixel photos are written to the stick so fast that I never wait before taking next photo. I took about 500 8,1-megapixel photos and about 5 minute video before the stick became almost full.My advice is to buy the largest you can afford. You'll be grateful for it."
4,sony memory stick,this review is about the sony memory stick duo for witch I ordered thinking that it would fit unfortunatly I had to aquire an adaptor for the duo which worked fine. the only prolem was that it took a week and a half to get to my place but does work greatdaniel
5,Sony 2 GB Memory Stick PRO Duo Flash Memory Card MSX-M2GS,Sony 2 GB Memory Stick PRO Duo Flash Memory Card MSX-M2GS excellent memory stick I have been satisfied and totally recommend
5,good,"haha it can't be bad.I got a Sony's digital camera.Sony uses own type of SD card, so I needed it."
5,Tons of memory for your PSP,"Nice cheap price. I use it for my PSP. Works great, I have tons of music and video and hardly put a dent in the storage capacity."
4,sony 2G memory stick,"This product works fine and for the price that I paid, I am pretty satisfied. There's plenty of space for me to store all my songs, photos and any other document."
5,shipping too high,"Every time you buy a small item,the shipping cost discourages you to go on,I often gives up an order for that reason.Sometimes,the shipping is more than 20 per cent of your order.too much,This is because Amazon is linked with a lot of sellers.But I have always be satisfied with the items I decide to order .This one is good.Francoise Hommeril"
5,Good Seller,"Good Product, especially since SOny won't allow anything else, and it was delivered very timely"
4,Good Value,"The card works great in my camara! However, I cannot get it to work with the adapter so my computer can read the card. Just a small inconvenience having to read the pictures directly from my camara."
5,"fast, reliably and lots of space","I use this memory card in my Sony Ericsson W800i cell phone for MP3 files. The phone can perfectly handle the card and everything works fine. In my computer the speed of the memory card reaches the limit of my card reader and in just a few minutes 2GB are copied on the card. The case of this memory card is robust and does not fall apart.In mobile devices that permanently access the memory card, please consider higher energy needs because of big capacity."
2,Genuine? No.,"It's a Memory Stick, but it is not made by Sony. I bought this product thinking it was, but it turns out it's not.It works... for the most part. But since it's not a genuine Memory Stick, its compatibility lacks. Lots of corrupt data, and that can be VERY disappointing for gamers and photography enthusiasts.Bottom line... if you want a CHEAP Memory Stick, buy it. If you want a GOOD Memory Stick, DON'T buy it. You won't be satisfied."
5,Great Product,"Ordering, and shipping were processed perfectly. The quality of this 2GB memory stick is excellent. I'm SOOO.. happy how the prices have dropped from my first purchase of a memory expansion stick 4 years ago!!I highly recommend this product."
4,So far so good,"I bought this to go with my Sony Cybershot DSCW80. Although I haven't taken tons of pictures yet, the ones I did take turned out great. The only thing I would change is that I wish the card came with a case. If you don't have it in your camera, there is really no good place to store it. Older memory cards I have bought all came with cases."
4,memory stick- worth it?,if buying a m stick do so from Amazon when its on offer. You get both the backing of Amazon and sony at an incredible prize.Quality is brilliant and so too the transfer rate.would recommend it any day
4,Not That Much of a Blast,"Yeah, this game's good, I don't know why they had to name it 'Sonic Blast' when a Sonic game had the name of 'Sonic 3D Blast'. Of course, it's not that good. The graphics seem like a poor attempt at 3D, I don't know why they couldn't just stick to 2D. I also don't like how, when you jump, the camera moves with you, and it's pretty annoying, but you can't blame the game that much for it, because it was made for a small screen. Playing as Knuckles is also pretty fun, because he can glide and climb, and, basically, do things that Sonic could never do, which is fine by me, because I'm a bigger fan of Tails and Knuckles than I am of Sonic the Hedgehog. Gliding and climbing or just running around? Choose between the two and defeat Dr. Eggman!(for now)"
3,It's an OK Sonic Game.,"This game doesn't really have a story line to speak of, but...the graphics are AMAZING, especially for 8-bit! I just wish that the execution was better, like in ""Triple Trouble"". Sonic is rather slow compared to his previous entires, and thanks to the 3D-style graphics, not as much detail can be put in each level. In otherwards, the levels are much smaller than you would find in ""Triple Trouble"". On the plus side, Knuckles is a playable character for the first...and only time on the game gear. And his graphics look every bit as good as on ""Sonic & Knuckles"" for Genesis.The later levels become a bit challenging, but overall, it's an OK Sonic Game."
5,Garfield at it's best,Very nice for small kids up to the age of 6 - if they aren't afraid of cats. My son really enjoys the show.
1,boring..Not anything like traditional garfield..,"This show is the worst garfield of the garfield cartoons i have ever seen.*It isn't funny like the old garfields from 80s/90s*I hate the 3d animation. It loses it's comic charm that made it popular in the first place in the 80's and early 90s. What happened??? They ruined it!*The voice acting and actors are bad*the animation looks cheap.I don't understand how Jim Davis can sell out like this.. he's destroying what he created.I'm a big fan of the old garfields.. i have every episode of ""Garfield and Friends"" and all of the holiday/special shows/episodes from the 80's and 90's and i loved that art style, voices, humor and animation.. that's a shameIt's a damn shame that I am such a fan and yet i cannot bare to endure watching this new ""Garfield Show"" as it makes me cringe.."
5,Your Game Gear can also be a TV!,"Did you think that Game Gear, the only handheld with a back light, was only to play games in the dark? If you did, you were wrong. Game Gear can become a color TV. Yes, just pull those bunny ears up and you can get your favorite non-cable channels. This item is great for car rides... if you get sick of playing Sonic 2 (impossible to beat! :O( ) then just whip out a TV and watch Ricky Lake, or The Jerry Springer Show. Your car trip will be over in no time! If you have a Game Gear, I suggest you get the TV Tuner. Its a great item."
2,Well the TV Tuner,"from what I understand only works with the original GameGear systems that Sega made. The GameGear units made by Majesco Sales Inc., the box states its NOT compatible with the TV tuner for the game gear."
4,Great Book that provides insight into the minds of men preparing for battle.,"This book was recommended to me by several readers who enjoyed my own book (Dawn of Empire) and took the time to email me about their thoughts. So I decided to give it a try, and I must say, I really enjoyed it. I always know I've found a good read when I start bookmarking certain passages to add to my own file of 'Interesting Ideas.'In Legion, Altimari goes into the minutiae of life in the legions, identifying how each of those aspects helps build the character and mind-set of the Roman soldiers, who usually fought and overcame numerically superior forces. While most think of legionary forces as purely military, their road building legacy is every bit as important.The author brings all this to life in a unique and entertaining way that fascinates as it educates. Bravo.Sam Barone, author 'Dawn of Empire' & 'Empire Rising'"
4,Altimari knows his stuff !,"Action, history, romance and justice. All the things that make up a good novel for me. I found them in here. Legion is a great story about Roman soldiers daily life. I learned from this book, something I think any book should do , and I was highly entertained. Kudos , Bill my friend. I still think you should write romance novels !!"
5,Excellent,This is a wonderful book that will pull you in by the first chapter and not let go until you've reached the very end. Development of the characters and the change you see in them will keep you reading late into the night as well as the events of the story line that make it hard to put down. This is well worth the money that the book costs and will entertain you for however long you spend reading it.
3,Mixed & Matched,"The book is an excellent narrative of the details of army life in a Roman Legion - truly good. The plot is silly and sticky sweet and a poor story for an adult. So, if your interest is in the details of a legionnaire's existance, the book is recommended - if you are an adult looking for a decent novel, pass."
2,A Bumper Crop of Corn in Ancient Gaul,"Written by an amateur and it shows - so corny I winced like a Touretter. Romans good, Gauls good, Germans bad, and no shades of gray. The principal character, the centurion Rufio, is a master at all his crafts: forger of men, psychologist, lover, linguist, military tactician, and motivational speaker. He is in mystical communion with the goddess of Victory and is an invincible warrior who loves cats and children. Raise your spears, you noble, shining heroes, and give a lusty hurrah - for Caesar! for Rome! (For crying out loud! I recommend Breem's ""Eagle in the Snow"".)"
1,New Age Roman Band of Brothers.,"Without a doubt the most ridiculous book on the Roman Legions I have ever read. It appeared that the author was going for a new age Roman Band of Brothers. He managed to turn legionnaires into sob sisters. The love interest of the main character had the most preposterous back story that I have ever read. It was completely unbelievable. These type of plot inconsistencies threaded through the book. For example; the legion commander won't release the sister of the wife of the local chief and ally from a slave trader because he didn't want to interfere with commerce and after all she was just a slave. Really! The dreaded German tribes are threatening to attack and you won't release a slave to keep you ally happy? Really! Give this one a pass, I wish I had."
5,Superb Recreation of the Roman Army,"As a military historian and museum curator I enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone interested in the military of the Ancient World. It is a delight both as a wonderful story and in its description of Roman military life, what it might actually have been like to be there. This book does a better job than any other I have read in portraying the true spirit of the professional Roman soldier of the early Empire. I'm also struck by the image of Cenurion Rufio as the defender of his culture very much in the way our military today is defending us from other forms of barbarism. A friend of mine so liked this book he sent a copy to his son who is a cadet at West Point.I can hardly wait for another installment on the life of Centurion Rufio."
3,Slightly boring...,"I absolutely loved the graphic novel and the film that this soundtrack is for, but was not so impressed with the soundtrack. The best tracks are ""Valerie"" and also the selections from V's Jukebox (Cry Me a River, I Found a Reason), but 90% of the rest of it was on the boring side, no real variation.Still worth buying, even if it isn't amazing."
5,Amazing score!,That may sound cheesy but the multiple fast pace tracks make this soundtrack one of the best I own.
2,potamus,What happened to the music playing during Stephen Fry's variety show where he humiliates the Chancellor?
2,Way out there.,"As a Laymon fan I have to say this has got to win the ""most far fetched"" award. Yes, Laymon is typical of far fetched novels but this wins hands down! Sherry is in for one heck of a night. I continued to ask myself ""why"" doesn't she ever call the police. I'm sure that would be a Laymon no-no, but geez this book just gets farther and farther away from reality. I found myself saying ""oh, come on-this can't be happening."" When a book just gets to unrealistic for me I have a hard time staying interested. This is one of them. I love Laymon and will continue to hunt down books he wrote. I just hope this is the worst!"
3,Worrying,"I sincerely hope that the author had his tongue planted firmly in his cheek when he wrote this book, because the idea that people like Toby Bones (or even bearing a slight resemblance to him) exist does not sit very well with me.Laymon has a tendency to write his male teenage characters without an ounce of commom sense, intelligence or morality.I've read plenty of Laymon, but this is the novel that began to turn me off him. If parts of this don't seriously insult you, worry about your own sexual tastes."
4,"Sick, Perverse Fun","If you are not into reading about gruesome violence and depravity, don't read this book. If you are open to hearing about others committing such atrocities,then pick this one up. Only fans of Laymons world where every guy is looking to ""get some"" and every woman considers sex enjoyable and is readily available for such, will like this and most of his other books. I know I did. Does this make me sick and twisted? Probably, but it sure puts a smile on my face to read this totally non-PC, pre-Reagan era prose."
2,Not up to par,"I am an avid Laymon fan, and have loved all 12 or so of his novels I've read up to this one. There wasn't anything in thsi book that really turned me away, but there wasn't anything that made me want to keep reading either. Picking up this book reminded me of the feeling of having to read books for high school. I was reading it just to finish the book, not because I wanted to. That said it wasn't a bad book. It's just that it doesn't offer anything aside from sex, violence, nudity and a psychopath. Some people may enjoy it, but there are much better Laymon books to read other than this one. Check out Island, Night in the Lonesome October, One Rainy Night, and The Travelling Vampire Show if you haven't yet read them."
4,Almost a great book,"I saw this book mentioned on Horrorworld as ""too intense to read."" Generally, that means it will be right up my alley. While I did enjoy the story, I felt that it could have been a little more graphic. I enjoy Laymon's work, but just when something wild was about to happen, the chapter would end, and it would move to different characters. By the time we got back to the interesting bits, they would be over. Still a great read, but not nearly enough of the gritty detsil you find in other extreme horror."
1,I've been robbed!,"I bought this book at a yard sale for 50 cents because the lady saw me swooping up all the Koontz. She swore I would like it.I'm with coachtim on this one (read his review)- shallow, stupid characters. Totally unbelievable and unconvincing.I want my 50 cents back, along with the IQ points that were drained from my mind as I turned page after page, waiting for the story to redeem itself."
2,Absolutely Horrible,"First of all the only reason I'm giving this two stars is because I like Laymon's voice as an author. The book itself is terrible. The female lead is a complete moron. She makes bad decision after bad decision. She's kidnapped, attacked, sexually abused, raped, sees people murdered, and is left for dead. After every single one of these incidents she has an opportunity to call the police for help and opts not to with no other reasoning than that she wants to avoid the hassle of dealing with them. When her family is in danger she chooses to leave a message on their home machine stating that if the see someone who looks like they male lead they should hide or just shoot him. Her sister is equally as stupid, going off with someone simply because he stated he knew her sister, getting her friends raped or killed in the process.The moral of this story really seems to be that most women are incredibly stupid, and if they are, they deserve whatever horrible things happen to them."
4,Come Out...and play.,"You all can read from the previous entries what this book is about. I agree with one of the reviewers that one of the things that this book had going for it is a strong female lead, which is a constant Laymon trademark. My question was what is up with his novels about substitute teachers that are getting stalked and tortured? This is his second novel that I have seen it in (the other being ""Into The Fire""). Anyways, I felt that the book took me on a ride as we share the night with Sherry and Toby Bones, and i truly enjoyed the read. My feeling was that the end was pretty good, but i personally expected more out of it. Although that aside, i thought that the story was great, characters were good, and the pace was just right. Definitely worth a read."
4,"Gory, and Fun !","I think this would make a sick movie lol I mean it !! I must admit it is definitely one of Richard Laymon's better novels... I'm a fan of original.. and this is it !!!! Pretty descriptive, and sick all in fun.. The ending was decent."
3,STAY IN TONIGHT...,"Richard laymons come out tonight has always been a book that bothered me mainly because it's abundance of flaws of the unordinary, i mean i'm used to the characters in his books acting unrealistically in alot of situations but in this book it's a true WOW....Laymon is having so much fun writeing this sick twisted piece that he completely forgets about reality and just goes absolutely nuts! Come out tonight is about an extremely out of control nut case of a kid named toby who has an obsession with a substitute teacher of his he had in school and when the situation presents itself he abducts her and heres where the craziness begans.....There is torture, humiliation, murder and everything absurd and if you can get past the somewhat ridiculous quarter of the book you will notice that the story is getting better and you want to see how it's going to turn out as laymons come out tonight gets very good in it's last quarter."
2,Too nonsensical,"I read lots and lots of Laymon. He's even written one of my favorite novels, ""The Traveling Vampire Show."" But of his books that I've read, this one may be the worst. It starts off with a quick, engaging storyline. The first 1/3 of the book was quite the page-turner. Then, the story seems to switch focus from a tale of survival, to one of revenge. This is where the entire novel falls apart. [...] Not one character in this book is true to life. Every decision the characters make is illogical. It's really frustrating to read a novel like this.Both Sherry and Brenda are complete idiots. Their friends are even stupider. No one is that stupid.[...]"
1,Thoroughly Repellant,"I am a fan of Richard Laymon. In the past, I have enjoyed many of his novels,""The Traveling Vampire Show"" being one of my favorites, but this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I wanted to wash my brain out with soap after I read it. It's one extended rape fest that reads like a porno snuff film put to paper. The characters aren't fleshed out enough for you to care about them and the so-called heroine makes so many unbelievably stupid choices that it just beggars the imagination. The women are all portrayed as empty caricatures motivated either by their sexual allure or lack thereof, and all the males (with one exception but he's only in the book for a second)as insensitive sex-crazed savages, willing to do anything to anyone alive or dead. I hated this book."
5,The Total Package,"Treat yourself to listening or viewing this remarkable young classical violinist. He has his own unique interpretation which is new and refreshing. His relaxed demeanor and romancing of the violin leaves the listener in a state of awe. He has total command of his instrument as he and his violin mesh in oneness. He even introduces you to ""rock"" in an elegant and mesmerizing way blending the two genres. One senses his originality while staying true to the past. Can't wait to see him in concert. Truly there are no words to describe this highly talented musician. He instantly moved to the top of my list of favorite musicians. He is truly one inspired artist."
5,The perfect English-Arabic Dictionary.,The best English-Arabic dictionary I have ever read in my life. It includes old and modern English words. And it is useful for every one at any age.
4,lots of fun,"Our 5 year old and 18 mo old grandsons are both having lots of fun with this bouncer. They use it to bounce, but also as a ""clubhouse"" or ""hideout"" or ""fort"" as well. It's good for coordination, balance, imaginary play, exercise. Some advice: Directions don't tell you, but you must inflate each section separately (floor, side walls, top). Once each section is inflated, the bouncer holds air quite well. We've had it outdoors on the patio for 2 weeks now, still inflated and doing fine. It does not come with a pump. You will need to buy a pump to do the inflation. Also, there are some colorful balls that come with the bouncer and add to the fun experience. However, you will need to purchase many more if you want this to be a ball pit. Overall, the kids are happy with this bouncer, so we are too."
3,Not as fun as I anticipated,"I have 2 year old twins, and I thought this would be the BEST gift ever. My daughter is training to climb Mt. Everest, is extremely active, and loves to jump - just not on the Jumpolene. The 2 of them play hide and seek around it, more than they go in it. It is now gathering dust in our dining room. Maybe as they get older it will become more exciting?? One can only hope..."
5,Wonderful toy!!!!,I just got this toy for my sons second birthday and he loves it. We have had it for two days now and he only gets out of it to eat and sleep. My three year old daughter loves it too. I love it b/c I can leave them alone in it I dont have to worry about them getting hurt. So I can do chores around the house. It is pretty big and I would reccamend that you keep it in the home b/c I didnt notice any tie downs on it. This is a great buy!!!!
1,Arrived defective,"This sure looked like a cute toy when I took it out of the package. Unfortunately, as soon as I inflated it I noticed leaks in two of the panels that made the toy unusable. I have had no luck getting my money back from CMS and am stuck with a lemon. I would not buy an inflatable toy online ever again."
1,My grandson is not Happy.,This product had 3 holes in it within 9 days of purchase. One hole is where the wall meets the floor and is impossible to patch..
1,FUN ... for a short while ...,"We purchased this product for our 4-year-old and she loved it. It unfortunately, didn't hold up well enough for her to enjoy it very long - and it wasn't because she was overly rough or abusive.Leaks developed all along the seams, and there are a lot of seams. So, after about 5 minutes, there would no longer be enough air in the bouncer for her to bounce. We repaired the first few, but then it developed so many leaks we simply couldn't repair them all, and the repairs did not hold. (All the initial repairs were made using the supplied repair materials. These materials covered about 4 repairs total. We had to resort to trying other repair methods after that. Those didn't work much better.)This was a total waste of money - especially since we could have purchased 3-4 regular trampolines for the same price."
3,wish it lasted longer,"I bought this castle for my grandkids for Christmas and they loved it! They didn't have the chance to grow tired of it though. It only lasted a few months. And no, no sharp objects were used - only daily play. I wanted to get them another one, but was shocked to see that the castle i bought for around 40.00 is now [...]. Inflation? since December? Not worth it since it only lasts about two months. I would buy another one at the price i originally paid for it though"
5,Great Toy!,"We purchased this for our 17 month old son. He absolutely loves it! We can't keep him out of it. I followed other reviews and bought an air pump. Worked like a charm! Hubby & I were able to inflate this in no time. However, there is an air plug inside the castle that our son found rather quickly & learned that he could deflate that chamber. I thought it was going to be a hassle to re-inflate it but nope, no problem at all. The number of balls included is a joke & we even purchased a pack of 100 balls on the advice of another review. Umm, yeah, we need to purchase another 2 or 3 packs of balls in order for the bottom of the castle to be filled completely. That really is the only disappointment in the whole thing but our son doesn't seem to mind."
2,"A lot of fun, but no lasting playability","I bought this item for my 2yr old son for Christmas this past year and when it arrived we got it setup for Christmas morning. He loved bouncing around in the castle and playing with his friends, they enjoyed playing pretend and battling with the swords. But the disappointing part was it only lasted for about two weeks because the seems in the castle started coming apart and it all started to deflate. And let me clarify, these were not holes but the actual seems where the compartments were put together were just coming apart and leaking air out. So I am now in the process of trying to return this item for a replacement, we'll see how that goes. Overall, if you want something fun for your child this is great, but if you want something that will last this is not the a good choice. You may want to buy something else that will last..."
1,Just one month and it already broke,even though my daughter is just under 35 lbs.The joint (bottom) cracked and now it is just a piece of junk.Not sure if it is worth returning it back to the store.I was wondering if anyone has any idea what sort of glue I need to seal it off.
2,royal disappointment,"My 4 year old got this on his birthday in July. Already bored with it. First of all we found that if 2 children leaned on the same side, it tipped over. This was the most fun for my son. Other than that, he grew tired of it VERY quickly. It constantly needs to be reinflated as it tends to lose air quickly. One of the swords has had a leak in it since day 1. I consider it a waste of money. On the other hand my 2 year old nephew loves it. I would not recommend it for over 3 years of age."
5,Wonderful Toy!,My son was diagnosed with Sensory Integration Disorder and jumping and bouncing is a wonderful activity for him - he LOVES balls and bouncing and this toy does it all! I did order the 100 balls separately and was glad i did - setup was simple and he was bouncing in it within minutes - it is HUGE though and i need to move it to another room but i am so happy with my purchase -
1,Seams Popped Right Away,I bought this last year for my kids. They total about 70 pounds. It popped within 2 days and I found the hole and applied a patch. It did it again a few days later and I couldn't find the hole. It is too big to put all the seams under water. Skip this.
2,Jump house gave out,My children received this jump house as a gift for Christmas. We put it up two days before Christmas and the kids loved it. It does take up a lot of space and even with an electric pump it took us 30 minutes to inflate it. Unfortunately the castle deflated two days ago. I found one hole at one of the seams of the bottom and the walls have another hole which I have not been able to locate.I am very dissapointed that this structure gave out so fast. We never had more than three children jump in it(more than three don't fit in anyways). And none of my children weigh more than 35lbs. It should be able to take the weight of three kids - but I guess not.So this jumphouse has lasted three weeks - very disappointing. I am going to contact Amazon for a replacement.
1,Not worth it,"This is my first review... It cost $28 to ship this thing, we spent another $50 on a high grade electric air pump and it still took over an hour and a half to inflate! It is too big for inside the house, but it takes too long to inflate for any short term use outside. Seemed like a really great idea...but I was wrong!!! My 2 1/2 year old was tired of it by the time we got the thing up."
3,SAVE YOUR MONEY,ONLY LASTED TWO WEEKS. BOTTOM AND CASTLE WALL LEAKING. BOUGHT THIS FOR MY TWO YEAR OLD FOR CHRISTMAS. CONSTANTLY INFLATING IT. FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS TO WARM UPTO ROOM TEMP. BEFORE INFLATING. TOO BAD BECAUSE SHE LOVES IT. GOOD LUCK FINDINGTHE LEAK. DISCONTINUED BY THE MANUFACTURER. NOW WHAT.??? SAVE YOR MONEY. THOUGHTI WOULD AT LEAST GET A YEAR OF USE. NOWHERE NEAR THE 60LB. LIMIT THAT IT SAYS.SAYS IT WILL HOLD TWO KIDS - 120 LBS. ONLY SHE HAS BEEN IN IT.SHE LOVED IT WHILE IT LASTED.
5,Great Substitute for the Real Thing!,"Santa brought this for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas this year to replace jumping on my bed! It is incredibly durable and handles my young son and my 10 year old playing in it together. Blowing it up initially was not a problem, since I had an air pump, however I do recommend having a small opening attachment, since only one of the sections has a large opening. Since we have hardwood floors, I also purchased24 Sq. Ft. (set of 6 + borders) 'We Sell Mats' Anti-Fatige Interlocking EVA Foam Flooring-Set of six Multi-Color Tiles-Each 2'x2'x3/8"" Thickto keep it from sliding and from possibly getting punctured from underneath. My only compliant is how strong the plastic smell was once it was blown up. After 2 days it has pretty much gone away. He absolutely loves his castle!"
2,Flat in a week,"Not durable at all, flat in a week, patches do not work as kids want to jump on it, waste of money."
2,Great toy ... if it didn't deflate after a month,"My daughter loved this toy when we bought it. I didn't get the pump, and it took us forever to inflate it. so if you have to have this toy, make sure to get the pump or use an attachment that works with a vacuum cleaner. Within a month, the seams were splitting and it would deflate. We were even cautious about kids getting on it without shoes! the only places where we got air leaks were the seams, and the patch kit didn't quite seal those up."
3,ok,This is ok but my son didn't care for it much. He would very seldom get in it so I took it back. He was 2 when I got this at walmart. It took forever to blow up with a electric pump.
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this for my boys (ages 2 & 4) for Christmas, hoping it would give them something to do indoors all winter. They enjoyed it for a little while, but not enough for the room it takes up and the price. After about 10 uses in 4 weeks, we went downstairs to find that it had deflated. I had read other reviews about how it got holes in the seams, but thought ""that won't happen to me."" It did. If you do buy it, buy it from the ""R Us"" place, not Intex, and buy the R Us $6.99 15-month protection plan."
2,Great if you love holes and poor customer service,"We've only had this bouncer for a month and are already on hole #6. It is not overinflated at all, and my 1 and 4 yr olds mostly just use it for a tent (It is so underinflated they can't get good bounce). The company has HORRIBLE customer service and said they offer no warranty on it (probably b/c they know it is made so poorly). I had high hopes for this, but now it is trash. If it was made better I might like it, but since it is so poorly constructed and the company obviously does not care about their consumers I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Popped right away at the seems!,"I must say that this toy was a real blast for my kiddos, HOWEVER, the quality is really poor. I got this for a gift for my kids and it popped at the seems after the 2nd time using it! Then it just kept ripping after patching it! I would not recommend paying $[...] for this since it pops extremely easy. I never even let me kids jump in this! I just used it as a ball pit. Very dissapointed!"
5,Birthday Gift for 1 year old daughter,"We gave this toy as a gift to our 1 year old daughter. We also have a 2 1/2 year old daughter. Blowing it up takes more time than a toddler can wait. So next time I would not blow it up in front of the children as their patience wore thin quickly. We also purchased the extra ""100"" balls. Our 2 1/2 year old LOVES this jump-o-lene. She gets in it as soon as she wakes up. Our 1 year old likes to climb in, retrieve a ball, throw the ball out onto the floor, and then play with just the ball. I'm sure as she gets physically stronger, she will enjoy the jump-o-lene as much as her sister. It has been up for about one month and is just beginning to lose some air. We set it up in our carpeted Great Room. Overall, we have been very pleased with this product."
4,"Good for younger kids, boring for older ones",I gave this toy a good review even though my son is bored with it. He's three and hardly ever plays with it. I wish I had bought it sooner!
2,lots of fun didn't last long,my grandson loves it but i can't keep up with the hole's i have to fix on the seams. my grandson is 3 years old and the only one to play in it. ikeep the air ware it should be but ihave had to patch 4 seams overall not a good buy
3,I'm sure it's fun if the air stays in....,"We blew it up on Christmas Eve...the next day it was deflated. Very disappointing. We will return and possibly try another one. It has good reviews, but for us it was a disappointment."
4,Great bouncer!,"Our 4 1/2 year old loves this toy, just make sure you have enough room for it. Also, I recommend getting extra balls to add to the fun!"
5,a lot of fun,"I got this bouncer with free shipping, so very good deal. This bouncer is a nice with decent size we can put it indoor. We used electric pump and took less than 30 min to pump it. It has been in our living room for more than 2 months without the need of repumping even many kids have been to our home and played on it. It is big enough for two small kids (5 and 7 years old to play in it). We also tried filling it with 400 balls or so to let the kids to have another fun.My son has low muscle tone, at first, he scared of playing inside. Then I used a candy reward to ask him jump inside to pick it, he then have fun in picking the candy inside the bouncer. So far, all the kids (less than 7 years old) who have come to our home enjoyed this bouncer.We think this is a good buy."
2,Didappointed,"I purchased 2 of the Jump-O-Lene Bouncers for both my l year old Grandsons for their Birthday. The Top (Yellow) part of the bouncer deflated the first day on BOTH of the bouncers. The boys love them, but I am very disappointed. If the top part already deflated, the whole thing won't last for very long. I feel your company should stand by your product and either refund my money, or send 2 new bouncers for my Grandsons."
2,too expensive,"We bought this one for older daughter 3 years ago hen she was 2.5 years old. She had a great fun. I paid $40 for a new one at Walmart back then. After 1 year, that bouncer got leaks and I had to throw it away.Now I am looking for a bouncer for my younger daughter who is 18 month old now. Now exactly the same model is $90? I am not going to buy it."
1,Product was a disappointment,We purchased this item for our two toddlers for Christmas and did not set it up until last month. When we set it up the kids loved it. Problem we had was the item would not stay inflated. It lasted a bout 2 days then started to deflate. We assume it must be a leak somewhere but cannot find the leak. Contacted Amazon and they have a 30 day return policy so we are stuck with it. I would not recommend this item. Not durable and we followed the weight rules and assembly directions. Too bad as the castle is cute if it would only stay inflated.
5,Amazing while it lasts,"We love this toy! It has been worth its weight in gold. However, the first hole arrived at about 6 months. We had to wait until the hole got bigger in order to find it. We had to re-inflate, which would last about 3 hours. Patching works, but then we got another hole. We are still currently using the damaged one. My 1 and 3 year old play in it every day with their friends. I am really happy overall and I think I'm actually going to replace it with a new one. It's the perfect toy for really hot or really cold days when we can't go outside."
3,Great but has weak seams,"We bought this for our son's 4th birthday - he weighs 35 pounds and is an only child (in other words, there are not a ton of other kids in here with him). He absolutely LOVES this castle, and we bought 2 packs of balls so he has 200 balls floating around in there with him. It is a fabulous toy for a kid and will consume many hours and tons of energy. I will say we are disappointed because 2 weeks into it, the large side wall contracted several leaks in the seams and so we have to blow it up several times a day to keep using it. It doesn't seem to be built to last - would love to see a more reinforced version hit the market that can stand the test of time - at least one that lasts more than two weeks with one kid."
4,Let them bounce off the walls!,"For the price (< $40), this bouncer is great for indoor fun for little ones. My 2-year old gets great bouncy fun. My 6-year old bounces some but mainly enjoys tumbling around in it and throwing the balls in and out. It's like a big air mattress with walls...fun bed for a kids' sleep-over, too. Cover it with a big sheet and it's a cool cave. I can't speak to durability outside; we only use it inside on the living room floor. So far, it's holding air. You'll definitely want an electric air pump (like for air matresses)for this. Also, the instructions are sparse. The floor is two different air bladders. The valve location for one is pretty obvious. The valve for the other one is on the bottom side."
4,good price,"This bouncy castle is a great deal for the money. We purchased it for my daughters second birthday party and it was a hit. You can only really let one or two children on at a time. The material doesn't seem too sturdy so I would really stick to the weight limit, and I wouldn't plan on it being a long term toy! It comes with 2 swords, one of which is already flat. My daughter loves the castle though, it was a lot of fun for the party and it is just her size!!"
5,Nikon Coolpix,"I love the way you can move the lens around for the perfect angle, shoot in color, sepia, or black & white, take video clips, and more. This camera takes wonderful photos, too. I used to have an Olympus.....but I'm thoroughly satisfied with my Nikon now! Worth every penny!"
3,Nice pictures and flexible. Lousy video,"First the good points. This is a great camera for quick outdoor shots. The 10x zoom and sport mode allow rapid shooting. Even inside close-up pics come out well without the flash if the target isn't moving too fast. The swivel lens feature has allowed me to get several close-up shots of my kids without them knowing they were being photographed. The zoom has allowed me to do the same thing from across the yard.The time delay feature, shoot every 30 seconds, was great Christmas morning. I set the camera on a tripod and then joined my family. 100 photos were taken by the time I turned off the camera.Last, but not least, the swivel lens makes the camera easy to put in a pocket.Now the bad news. The video ability is below that of my Canon A75 from several years ago. Still, it's good enough for most family videos."
4,"Good digicam, but not for a Pro","I bought this camera 6 months back and I am very happy with it. In daylight the image quality is unbeatable. I was very impressed with daylight photos and that too without flash. In Nightshot it is OK and most of the times the image comes blury, even after keeping the camera stable. To get the best picture one has to play around the PointNShoot and Scene Modes and decide what suits them best.In Movie mode movies come out fine, after all it is not a Camcoder.4 stars to this one. I love it."
4,"Nice camere, tiny with 10x zoom","I bought this camera for 1 reason: It is the smallest 10x zoom camera currently on the market. It has some decent features and produces good, but certainly not professional quality images. I have found a couple of problems though: Occasionally, with the flash in red-eye reduction mode, the camera's automatic in-camera red-eye repair feature turns other red colored things grey, such as people's lips. This is a pretty annoying problem and the only way to solve it is to not use the red-eye reduction flash mode. I have contacted Nikon and there is currently no solution to the problem. I also found the camera to have quite a high amount of purple fringing/chromatic aberration in high contrast areas, especially when at full zoom. It also has trouble focusing in low light, even with the focus assist lamp. Other than those problems, it is a good compact point-and-shoot camera."
2,not worth the price,"i was really excited about this camera. i dabble in photography, but wanted a camera i'd have a little more control over, and would be able to experiment with while taking professional quality shots. this little guy, however, just doesn't cut it. the flash tends to wash everything out, and you have to use it even when there's adequate lighting. also not great for action shots. i've yet to be 100% happy with a shot i've taken with this camera without using some sort of photo editing software. i work mainly in b&w, and the colors are never as crisp as i'd like. if had it to do over again, i'd go with something else."
2,Lens fell off inside camera,I bought this camera because of the swivel feature and have been satisfied with that feature. The lens fell off inside the camera one day without sustaining any damage beforehand.
2,Do not buy this camera,"Battery life, 10x zoom is great but does not stay focused. Other than that it is great looking camera that it still get awe wows but ain't worth it."
1,I hate this camera,"Peace of crap. I am so mad I spent so much money on this camera. Pictures are blurry no matter what setting it's on. When in poorly lit places (at night, school plays) the pictures turn out so dark you can't even see them. It's not easy to change setting. I have not one nice thing to say about this camera. I have had it for 2 years and I hate it. I am very happy that I dropped it and the lens broke! This gives my husband reason to buy a new one!!"
1,Awful Camera Awful Service,"I purchased this camera less than two years ago for nearly $350. It recently would blur when trying to focus. I'd manually focus the camera, but the autofocus would override it and blur the picture. The camera tries to be too user friendly, and you can't configure any photo settings manually.The camera would not focus anymore, I sent it away to Nikon to get it repaired, and they wanted $115 to repair the camera.So I paid almost $200 a year to have a sub-par crappy camera with bad software.Don't make the same mistake I did. Never buy a Nikon. Ever."
4,Works great,"The swivel camera works great. The video recording part of the camera is not very clear, but picture taking is fine. All in all, I am satisfied with this product and its price."
3,good one....but not best,Camera is pretty good and jazzy.I like the flip-flop lens but sometime it is pain.Also picture quality is not great.
3,"basicly, it's a good 10x optical zoom DC","I like the old coolpix turnable lense desigen. And the 10x optical zoom is useful, too. But the battery life is sort and the LCD is too big to leave space for your hold finger and the hand will touch it all the time in eye level shot."
3,Great zoom terrible low light.,"This camera has the most wonderful design and form but it is really bad in low light. The flash is very harsh, and the higher ISO makes the images very grainy. I really like this camera but I wish Nikon could do a better job with flashes on these folding body designs. One review I read said the problem was that the flash was too close to the lens resulting in the glare and reflection issues.Size is great so much better than my 990."
2,Clay : Hand Building,"The title is more precise than one would hope. The text delivers not a guide nor a how-to book, but rather a simple definition. Basic yet adequate black & white photo illustrations provide no more than a cursury surfing of the term hand building. Although useful to define the technique from throwing on a wheel, this book is useless if one is searching for an in depth study of proper hand building technique."
5,The Composer Genious,"The flow of notes and chords in this album is awesome.There are runs and patterns that very few[if not any]musicians could possibly envision,there's no other like them anywhere.I don't think that his genious will be fully appreciated ever because no other composer that I know of understands the flow of music as he does.I'm glad that I got to experience his genious in my lifetime."
5,Fun plays,The script contains fun plays for performance. The copy came quickly and was exactly what I was looking to find.
2,Play,This is 3 one act plays in one.first is little Miss Fresno i dont remember what the 2end one was but the 3erd was Chocolate Cake. all of them are all female parts no males are in any of it. and none of its very good
4,Very good listen,"I listened to the audible version and enjoyed it very much. The accent of the performer lent an air of authenticity to the book that I enjoyed. Liked hearing about the mans life from his own point of view. Will follow it with a less biased version at some point to see how they compare, but this was very well written and well performed."
2,A literary chore,"It has been over a year since I ground my way through this book. My lack of adaptability to the Olde Worlde English may have contributed to this. I found this to be a long book about an interesting individual whose sole purpose for writing the book, I have concluded, was to leave a lasting, self-congratulatory reminder of his own life. I must disagree with a previous review that stated it was a must for any young ambitious person. I am; it wasn't.For sheer inspiration from another person's life, I would recommend works on Lincoln, the Wright brothers (Kill Devil Hill), Richard Branson, Edison, Spielberg, Mme Curie, Bruce Lee, Iacocca and Einstein."
5,The Bill Gates of a century ago.,"This book was pracitically written for the ambitious young man, as there are many references to this. Mr. Carnegie serves as a great role model, which I feel is quite important, especially considering the terrible events in schools lately. Carnegie emphasizes the importance of self-improvement, knowing your talents, being kind, and also the importance of public speaking. You will learn important lessons thru personal anecdotes of his life. This book should be required reading for every adolescent attending high school."
5,Huge Frankie Beverly&Maze Fan,"don't a day hardly go that I don't Groove to Maze&Frankie beverly.there smooth,but Funky in the Pocket Jams always pack much punch. they are to me the Last Important R&B Band. they are Our Black Grateful dead&will sell out any place in a chocolate city in a heartbeat. they never were self-Promoters or Sold Out to showcase there talents. ""Golden time of Day"" makes you feel good. there harmonys, arangements&vibe makes you feel good. just like back in the day how Earth,wind&Fire,the Isley brothers did&Like Today how R.Kelly's spirited Stepping Songs have that kind of vibe well Frankie Beverly&Maze leave that lasting feel good flavor. Look at california, happy feelin's,etc... are timeless classics. Frankie Beverly will always be the Musical truth to me.a Badd soul brother who ain't never got his due to me."
5,Super Reader,"The Weird of the White Wolf also is a book that contains several smaller pieces of work, namely :The Dream of Earl AubecThe Dreaming CityWhile the Gods LaughThe Singing CitadelThe first is a quick Eternal Champion interlude.In the Dreaming City Elric returns to the Dragon Isle to attack his cousin, who is holding his lover captive.While the Gods Laugh show Elric journeying with Moonglum, his version of the Companion to Champions, to find the Dead Gods Book.The Singing Citadel is a building with the properties of a siren, basically. Elric and Moonglum investigate."

5,Healthy!,"The first ingredient in this food is Fresh Chicken, which is something many dry pet foods can't say.The pieces have gotten smaller since I started buying this food four years ago, all the better for tiny cats/animals."
4,Worth It for the Money....,"I bought this CD to get a copy of Eddie Shaw's ""Dunkin' Donut Woman"" which I located by accident in searching for it on Amazon. I heard this song on Sirrus XM, the Bluesville channel in my car. It was worth it just for this song alone. The rest of the songs on this Cd aren't too shabby either. Great value for the money."
3,"Not the best movie, but I've seen worse","I remember seeing this movie when I was very young, and while it's not the best animated film I've ever seen, it's certainly not the worst. The animation is satisfactory, and Freddie IS rather handsome and charming for a frog. Everyone has their own opinion about this film, of course, but maybe you negative critics out there are being just a wee bit too harsh. There are movies out there that are far worse than this one, you know."
2,somewhat disappointing,"I greatly enjoyed Lutes' 'City of Stones', but this book was somewhat disappointing: the characters were less well developed, the plot was vague, and it was simply not as good. Still, it was about average for graphic novels I have read. I think 'City of Smoke' is likely to be a much better choice for those who have read 'City of Stones'."
4,Great story...,Unfortunately the book fell apart before I finished reading it. As did a replacement copy. I hope I can rebind it because it will repay rereading.
5,My dogs love these...,Recommended by our vet. I was afraid the dogs would not want to eat them (because I need to give it to them for dental health) but they LOVE their treats. Switching to Medium size next time - the large treats are a little big for my dogs (52 and 34 lbs).
5,Safe good toys!,I really like the safe factor with these cat toys because I feel comfortable leaving them out for play knowing they do not pose a swallowing hazard.
1,Pretentious and potentially misleading,"I purchased this book because it had 5 star reviews and I thought it might be worth adding to my collection of books on tai chi. I was sadly disappointed. This is not really a book about tai chi chuan; at least not as it is generally understood, particularly in China. Rather it contains the author's musing about forms of slow meditative movement loosely based on certain tai chi chuan principles. I say ""musings"" because on the whole what the author has to say is vague and not very coherent.Perhaps the character of the book can best be described as self-consciously ""new age"". The only reason I can think of for buying it, is as an illustration of one of the directions in which tai chi has developed in the west. If it were the only book one were to read on the subject, what little you would learn from it would be highly misleading."
2,Buyer Beware!,"This is not the quality binding you would expect from Library of America! I have not yet read this book but I have my copy here in my hand. The binding appears to be glued, not sewn. The coversare not cloth, but flimsy, slick cardboard. This is really a disappointing sight from the project which made its name withsturdy cloth editions. This might still make a nice gift book, but it is not what I expected from this publisher."
5,A beautiful book,"""Writing"" combines elements of fictional narrative, literary theory, and conversational Q&A all in Duras's recognizable voice. It is a wonderful book allowing readers to experience both Duras's writing process and the finished outcome."
5,inspirational gospel song? Ray Boltz has it from God,"RAY BOLTZ has really touched my life his inspirational songs from God. This is not from me alone but also from a lot of my good friends in Nigeria.Ray has a special gift from God which enables him to carry his listeners to the actually scene of whatever he is singing about. He has demonstrated this in all his album I have: Concert of a life time(I dreamed I went to heaven & I will praise the Lord), No greater sacrifice(What if I..?), Honor and Glory(the last to be chosen), Season Changes(I think I see gold),Another Child(Ballad of william Joe) and all the tracks in The Classics. Coincidental I was out today (Nov. 13 2001) to check if Ray Boltz has released any album after the Classics and when I Couldn't find it in the stores, here I am searching through amazon thereby dropping this review.I pray that God breath of inspiration will continually be poured on Ray Boltz on daily basis. Amen."
2,An essential recording? No.,"I must respectfully disagree with Jerry McCulley concerning his review of this album. ""Little Deuce Coupe"" is by no means a bad record, but to pick this album as an ""essential recording"" instead of ALL SUMMER LONG, TODAY, SUMMER DAYS (AND SUMMER NIGHTS), FRIENDS and SUNFLOWER, to name just a few, boggles the mind.This is hardly an album that properly introduces a listener to Brian Wilson & Co. A Beach Boys collection is not THAT incomplete without ""Little Deuce Coupe"". It IS incomplete without the previously mentioned records.This album has a nice, pleasing pop sound, and Ballad of Ol' Betsy, Cherry Cherry Coupe and Shut Down are classics. But an essential recording? No.Furthermore, ""I Get Around"" does not appear on this album. Look it up."
4,An OK Tie-In,"I see this book as a useful handbook for understanding the film. However, Clarke's treatment is pretty bland. There isn't the penetrating, archetypal feel of Kubrick's masterpiece. (The movie benefited from an almost total lack of dialogue, and a fabulous musical score, both of which this book obviously lack.) This novel seems like merely an interpretation. It is a book that is fun to read, but where is all the philosophical and psychological depth? Its major failure is in trying to be definitive; an open-ended screenplay like 2001 didn't need this approach in its tie-in. Also, shame on Clarke for trying to make money off three mediocre sequels! However, if you like sci-fi, you'll probably enjoy this book, but by no means does it eclipse the movie."
5,"Majestic, just like the movie","A word to anyone who said the movie was more awe-inspiring; not only the book DID come out first, but sometimes I'm starting to think it's because it was in the end of the 60's and people were um... on some stuff, that's they were ""awed"". Hippies. ;P Seriously, the movie was great, but so was the book. Arthur C. Clarke is simply a genius, he gave us a great insight about possible explanations for the origins of mankind and so forth. He truly is the greatest author of science-fiction! HAL was pure genius, Bowman freaked me out when he took his last trip (no pun intended..^^;;;) through the stars, and Moonwatcher (or whatever the ape leader was named in the beginning... I can't be sure as I remember the translated and/or butchered version most, unfortunately) was a great idea. I liked how you could view the world through his eyes. Anyway, there are mighty good reasons as to why the 2001 saga will forever be remembered, and by all means read the sequels!"
2,This guy is great???,"If Clarke reaches any kind of greatness here, its largely due to Mr. Kubrick. Want some real science fiction literature? Try Robert Heinlein or Frank Herbert."
2,CONFUSING BOOK JUMPS AROUND,"This book is definitely for sci-fi types only!!! I read it as a part of an assignment and hated it. While it does touch on the advances of technology and their lead to man's downfall, it falls short of having a steady plot that is easy to follow. The characters are not entirely described before you even find out who they are and where they are headed, or even what time period you're in!!!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Alien monument mystery.The strong point of 2001 as a novel is that it actually explains what the hell is going on in its movie counterpart, from the prehistoric man segments, right on through.With the discovery fo the alien monument on the moon and the shock that engenders, through to the mission to Saturn to work out what is going with the alien monument makers, and the post-HAL phase with Bowman, leaving you with a far greater understanding and appreciation for what at times can seem a bit of a drug trip otherwise.Definitely worth reading for that."
2,"To tell you the truth, I was kinda bored.","2001 has been called the ""definitive science fiction book of all time."" I have read a fair amount of science fiction. I plan to read a lot more. I found 2001 merely average. The three sections of the book are almost stand-alone tales; the transition between is mildly confusing. It took me quite some time to read this, as I was not terribly engaged with the tale except during Hal's defection. Even that, though, was a little telegraphed. The alternate creation myth was thought-provoking, but not terribly engaging. I do; however, want to know what happens next, so I will be picking up 2010 shortly."
5,Very thought-provoking story,I admit I watched the movie before I read this book and although certain parts of the movie greatly amused me I was confused beyond belief. The book is far better. It explains everything in detail and really gives you a sense of bizarre isolation in a way.Hal the computer still remains my favorite character and in the book his murderous tendencies are not only explained in detail but also have reasoning behind them. Not only this but the monolith and the apes seen in the first scene of the movie are not nearly as ambiguous and they do connect very well with the rest of the story in the book. Nothing is left dangling in the air for the reader to figure out on their own. The ending is the strangest most thought-provoking finish I have read in any book. It really gave me a sense of wonder.A quick but very good read I suggest this to not only those who like science fiction but also those that like to ponder the big questions.
4,"Forget the film, read this instead","This is one of the most absorbing novels I've read in some time. A discovery on the moon leads man to journey in to the depths of space to find it's and perhaps mankinds origins. The book is written beautifully and you acually feel as though you are out there in space yourself. And then there is HAL, the computer system that runs the ship who, in my opinion, makes this novel a classic (and how many times has HAL been copied since). Do not judge this book on the tremendously boring Kurbrick film, read Clarke's novel instead. The novel has far more atmosphere and makes ten times more sense than what Kubrick produced.Get it and read it, it it totally worth while."
2,Expected better,"...at times far too poetic for a casual reader like me. The plot was very hard to grasp, it left me with many unanswered questions...although the writing was magnificent and descriptive, it was slow paced and often ""boring."" There were some very enticing moments but were followed by lagging scenerios .,.."
2,Clarke should stay away from writing novels.,"I'm not about to compare it to the movie, that's not what novels are for. This book, though, is remarkably bland, and lacks any sort of focus. Written awfully literally, it leaves little to the imagination and bores the reader with a word for word, often technical account of what is going on. Clarke lacks even a hint of an interesting writing style, which can be seen in all of his books and often succumbs to creating awfully corny scenerios to liven up this novel."
5,"Great book, STRONGLY RECOMMENDED","This novel is so enthralling and addicting, I read it in one day. I recommend this to anyone interested in expanding their own horizens. FIVE STARS."
5,is this the best book ever written?,"is this the best book ever written? well, it certainly deserves a serious consideration for the title.it all begins with the haunting description of an ancient civilisation of ape men, then progresses to the discovery of a mysterious monolith on the moon,carries on into the depths of the solar system as a spacecraft is sent out to investigate the source of an ominous signal and finally culminates incredibly in places your imagination will never be able to understand nor believe. this book is probably the most influential sci fi classics of our times,its arguments are cogent, its implications are amazing and its visual images are stunning. its not a book, its literally a transcendent experience. if you're a sci fan devour it, if you're just an avid reader, buy it.everybody must read this book, if not have it on their book shelf. its a piece of history."
4,Art Clarke saves the world from itself,"The amazing thing about this book is that it isn't dated. I mean, the internet, for instance. Art didn't see the form we have today, but he did forsee e-newspapers. The plot wears well, and reminds us how the world was in the '80's, we thought they would push the button and turn the key, and blow civilization away long before now. Mr. Clarke's solution to the problem is unique, to say the least."
5,"Wicked Book, Movie.............","I believe this book Is Great, it would have to be my very favourite book. I thaught it was so good that i went to my local video store and hired it straight after i finished and watched it and to my dissapointment it was hopless, fair enough it is a classic but it has everything and if i hadn'y first read the book i wouldn't have understood it at all, But getting back to the book, it is marvelous."
5,The Mother of all Science Fiction,"This is my favorite science fiction novel of all time! However, much of the credit goes to Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick and Clarke holed up together in a hotel in Manhattan and hashed out the details for the plot. The movie and the book happened contemporaneously, and I have to say that - as great as the book is - the movie is better (I believe it is the best movie ever made). Even though there are differences between the book and the film (Saturn?), I believe one should see the film first and then read the novel to get a more straight-forward interpretation of what happened."
4,"This book was awesome, but I may be too young...","I did love this book, but I'm only 11 years old and it was a little skippy at times. My favorite types of books are science fiction, but this one may have been a little too high for me. I have never seen the movie, and I will shortly, because then the story might come a little more clear to me. Awesome Book!"
5,Arthur C. Clarke is a genius in his story of alien contact.,"You're the capatin of the ship 'Discovery' on yourway to Saturn; to find something that holds a 3 million year old secret. Your actions in this voyage will determine the fate of humanity, and yours as well. Arthur C. Clark paints a world of the furture that is about to find out the answere to a question humans have asked for years; are we alone in the universe?"
5,This is better than the movie.,This was a great book. The way Arthur C. Clarke can write is great. 2001 could make a good PC and Video Game. I would reccomend this book to all my friends.
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS OF ALL TIME,2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY deserves to be ranked next to STAR WARS and THE WAR OF THE WORLDS among the greatest sci/fi novels of all time. Arthur C. Clarke probes deep into human evolution and advances in technology which may lead to man's own downfall. These are among some of the themes addressed in this insightful book. To some extent it is even better than the movie.
4,Is good scifi timeless?,"If I were to rely on this book alone, I would say yes! Although some minor details seem dated in the book, the main concepts and the depiction of the planets are detailed without being boring and sound believable (specially if you are not a professional astronomer).The book has great pacing (maybe except for the first part where the monolith tinkers with our ancestors brains) and culminates beautifully with the transformation of Bowman into the star-child.If you have already seen the movie or even read the book previously and enjoyed it, I would highly recommend this paperback edition for the rather lengthy preface by the author. There he describes his partnership with Kubrik, his conversations with Asimov (!) and, among other trivia, tells us that HAL has nothing to do with IBM (can you believe him?)."
4,Adventures and scientific phantasy,"This famous book, written because of the Stanley Kubrick movie, was a bit tedious in the first half. When HAL starts to misbehave and Dave Bowman continues alone the story picks up and it becomes very entertaining."
2,superfluous,"There's no need to read this book. Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" is one of the great films of the twentieth century. Arthur C. Clarke's ""2001"" is deeply ordinary. The things that make a film great a different from the things that make a book great, and a book that dumbly follows its parent film's lead cannot amount to much. I can think of one, and only one, (weak) reason to read this: if you are curious about all the weird stuff at the end of the movie, Clarke offers an explanation, of sorts. But I keep forgetting just what the explanation is. Kubrick's images are indelible."
2,Boring and mundane,"I'm surprised by all the five-star reviews this book is getting. It took me months to finish this book because it was so boring. After discovering a black slab on the moon that is thought to have been planted by aliens, a team is sent to Saturn to investigate. The first half is utter torture to read, as the book jumps from one story to another, leaving the reader frustrated. Things picks up in the second half when HAL, the ship computer, begins to act up. But overall, this book is a big disappointment. I haven't seen the movie, but it must be better than the book."
2,"Average, really","Let's not forget that the book was based on the film, not the other way around. 'Nuff said."
3,"Some powerful moments, some that DRAGGED","When the book worked, it was impossible to put down. Mind-expanding, fun, riveting - and creative. I loved the first half especially. But when it wasn't working, it was slow and I had to skim. Too much technical stuff, too much weirdness. It drifted away from the story and characters and turned into a dull astronomy textbook.I found it interesting that the book was written more or less after the screenplay. For a book based on a screenplay, it outpaced my expectations, and was worth the read. What I also found interesting was that this book was quite a different beast from the movie. Yes, the ""Hal"" parts overlapped - and were disturbing in both - but the rest struck me as pretty different.My overall assessment: fairly good junk food. Not too deep, but engaging enough to help waste a few hours of free time..."
4,this is really a great book,This book written many years ago still facsinates us by its brilliant exposition of man's power of imagination !! Mr Clarke though by present standards indicates the specifications of the HALl computer as one even lower than some of the present generation computers Anyway this makes great reading
4,A Wonderful Classic,"2001: a Space Odyssey by Arthor C. Clarke is a must read for all Science Fiction lovers. It is such a classic and yet revolutionary for its time. In fact, this book was so revolutionary that it set a trend for Science Fiction books to come. It is filled with many captivating thoughts that really get you thinking. It shows you an interesting idea of the rise of man and another look into its future. The book also has several plots that link and merge together throughout the course of the book.If you enjoyed the movie, you'll love the book. It is extremely detailed and you'll feel as if you're right there watching the events as they play out. The author spends a lot of time describing every important person and thing. Though this can get boring, it adds a nice touch to the book.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Arthor C. Clarke is brilliant. I would definitely recomend this book, especially if you enjoy Science Fiction. This is why I give this book 4 stars."
5,EPICALLY SUPERB IF YOU WANT TO LEARN,"I learned the ways of the Universe reading this book. I only read the first part of the book and it opened my mind to how Evolution is Creation. We live in an amazing realm. Reality or Programmed Reality? I've had a blast owning this book, and I plan to read it some day when I can stop my mind from being so scared? I AM SO SCARED TO READ ANYTHING ANYMORE? THATS WHY I WANTED TO STAY 20 DAYS BY MYSELF WHEN MY MOM WENT ON VACATION."
4,A great intro to sci fi,I really enjoyed the classic. Nice to see how it was so faithfully followed in the film version. Shame that I can't find the sequel 2010 on Amazon. Hope they create a link soon.
4,books are better than films,"One of those stories where the addage - ""The book is better than the film"" is very true. An epic, thought provoking tale, sadly let down by the movie."
4,Compelling,"From a freshman: I thought this book was a story that can't be put down. You just keep reading and reading. I liked it because it made your mind dart to different conclusions every sentence. it linked the evolution of man with finding signs of civilization on Saturn. All in all, this book was one of the best I've read."
2,This film Croaked!,"This film has parallels with ""Humanoids from the Deep"" insofar as they both concern the attack of mutant creatures on a bevvy of beauties in a small USA town.This film has the feel of a smaller budget (Humanoids actually had some 'name' actors in it). Further, there's only one creature in this film, and his costume looks so much like a man in green rubber (by comparison, the low-grade costumes in Humanoids look more believable).Even when he 'mates' with a human its less explicit than Humanoids, he only thrusts into the air over one woman.Given that this film is made more recently, you'd expect some improvement over the 'big-hair' 80s feel of Humanoids. But this film is the lesser brother."
2,Looking For A So-Bad-It's-Good Movie? KEEP LOOKING!,"The beginning is great. Nice and campy. Then the rest of the movie takes itself seriously until the last five to ten minutes where it gets campy again. Maybe they could have pulled this off if the actors could act, but I doubt it.Here's the essence of the thing: It's a boring movie that the producers realized was a boring movie and so they are trying to sell it as an homage to old sci-fi/exploitation flicks. The trailer for the movie is great. It's too bad the movie never delivers what's promised.I'm giving it 2 stars because I still respect that someone in this day and age made a man-in-frog-suit flick and it got distribution. I just hope this doesn't close the door on potentially good campy/homage horror."
4,Frogggy morning surprise,"Pure entertainment reminiscent of the old Sat. matinees. Loved it because of the offbeat humor with a message to make you sit up and take notice, what is happening to our eco-system? Kristi Russell performed her role with just the right touch of exasperation, hope to see her again. Think this will become a cult classic for all time."
1,dónde está mi pedido?,no me ha llegado mi pedido aún Tengo dos pedidos realizados con fecha de entrega del 12 y 18 de diciembre respectivamente Quiero saber dónde están mis solicitudes
5,Almost perfect Clash compilation,"This is a great job of putting together and the debut and London Calling, but instead of Combat Rock it should have been Sandanista. Aw well, can't win them all."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a 56 year old woman - who has been a huge Clash fan. I was not disappointed in the CD's that I returned except that one of them skipped which is way I returned same. However, I was disappointed in the fact that I was not reimbursed for the amount that I paid. I can understand deducting for shipping/handling but only reimbursing me $8.96. That's not acceptable.Sincerely."
4,Relaxing reading,"Reading a Rosamunde Pilcher book in itself is an incredibly relaxing experience. The scenery she paints, is very evocative in its detail, the weather conditions appropriately accentuate the mood and the characters dance in and out in the graceful and precise rhythms of a minuet. In 'Wild Mountain Thyme', the scene is set during the winter in the beginning of February. The action starts in London where a two year child is abducted from his secure home with his grandparents by his biological father on a moment's whim. The father resumes his relationship with an old flame, who is also obliging enough to take care of the child. The couple head to Scotland on an overdue vacation and events conspire to bring together different people from different backgrounds to find love and gratification in each other, unfolding effortlessly towards the happy ending and a new beginning for everyone involved.Read this book, for an instant, it will gladden your heart."
4,Rosamunde Pilcher,"I'm surprised at myself. I am actually a big mystery fan. However, I read one of Rosamunde's stories in a Reader's Digest condensed book, and have been hooked ever since. Yes, these are romance stories. But Rosamunde has an incredible ability to weave descriptions of the countryside and homes in her stories so that you can truly picture them yourselves. It has made me want very much to visit Scotland, to see the wonderful scenes she talks about.I don't feel that the romances are ""sappy"", either. I would highly recommend Rosamunde's stories to anyone. They are not complicated stories, so a fast read, but you do feel at the end you have read something worthwhile.Wild Mountain Thyme was quite fascinating. You find yourself wanting to tell some of the characters to ""wake up"" and see what they are getting into. In other words, you are woven right into the plot of the story.Enjoy reading her stories, everyone!"
5,Very enjoyable.,"Rosamunde Pilcher , is always the best. I could read her books ten times over and never tire.All are excellent"
1,Horrible Company,"Toshiba is the worst company and manufacturer of notebook computers. I purchased a Satellite 3005 Notebook just over one year ago and have had nothing but trouble. It was the worst $...investment ever. Here is my list of issues and repair attemps leading to my frustration:Restored system to previous dateTwo complete system restoresFour replaced CD drivesIInstalled updated display driverReplaced system boardInstalled updated BIOSReplaced battery (not covered on warranty).Their costomer service, support, and warranties are a joke. They only use poorly refurbished replacement parts to repair their poorly manufactured products. Stay away from Toshiba."
5,Great product,This is a great product for helping cleanse the liver.I would buy again when I run out. Hopefully it has allthe ingredients as listed.
4,A necessary supplement..,"A lot of natural health practitioners who will tell you that for liver heath you need to be taking Milk Thistle, especially if you consume alcohol. This is one of the least expensive and easiest to take supplement I've tried. I'll be reordering this one."
5,Quality product,"Since over-the-counter supplements are not regulated by the FDA. I subscribe to [...] who independently tests nutritional supplements as they run their own tests to see if a product truly delivers what it says it does. Out of 10 different companies selling Milk Thistle in the market they tested, Jarrow was the only one who passed."
5,Milk thistle,I have used this for 1 year on the advice of my Dr.and have had noticeable improvement in my livertests; great delivery and nicely packaged.
5,Jarrow Formulas Milk Thistle 200 Capsules,I've been taking this product for the past couple of months and the results have been positive. I usually take a pill before a heavy meal as a preventative measure. Along with this I also take a digestive enzyme and my bowel movements have been smooth and steady(and I feel less bloated).I have not experienced any negative side-effects from taking this product and the ingredient magnesium stearate is vegetable sourced(which might be important for vegetarians to know). Overall this is a great product and I will continue to take it.
5,the best.,"works relly good.i well recommend it to athers too,excellent prudoct.and resnably priced,i orderd it to my sister and she is verry satisfide."
1,Canceled order but they still shipped it,"Unfortunately, they only show part of their label (very clever). If you can find it in a store read the label and you will be amazed at the additional products they include which is why I canceled my order. There are other more natural forms of Milk Thistle out there in liquid and tablet/capsule form that are better and cheaper. Hope this review helps confirm not to order this product or brand."
4,Works well,This product seems to help. Would recommend it to others and continue to take it as one of my daily supplements.
2,Cute but not comfortable,"These shoes are very cute and are very high quality, however there is absolutely no padding on the shoe. Very uncomfortable when you walk. I returned them because I couldn't imagine wearing them for a long period of time."
4,Good product,"I am very happy with the end result, but was really a pain to put together. Directions could have been better."
3,HIts and misses,A hit with me is the overall ease of installation and the adjustable length. An annoying miss is the fact that cables cannot be routed inside the mount without taking the mount apart since the bolts that hold each section together take up too much space. Admittedly you don't change cables very often. This mount is super-sturdy but then the projector position adjustment could be better designed for smoother manipulation. Overall a solid mount that's attractive and easy to install but not perfect.
4,Nice Value,Very attractive watch. Love the deep bluish/purple face. Screw down crown is a nice feature on this price watch. Very nice weight and heft. Looks much more expensive than it was. Rotating bezel a bit hard to rotate - very slick and hard to grip to turn it. Seems to be freeing up after using it some. Keeps excellent time. Luminescent hands and dial work well. One minor complaint is that the band seems to scratch relatively easy.
4,Invicta 9204 stainless steel men's pro diver watch,"Re: The bracelet. The photo did not show that the center links are shiny and do not match the outer links which are brushed steel. Also, the color of the dial is more of a midnight purple than blue (it looks great). Other than that it is a fabulous watch, good heavy weight and easy to use the settings."
2,Are these defective?,"A nice looking watch except for the fact that the writing at the bottom of the face os crooked, which spoils the appearance and it's hard to set because there's not enough friction in the stem. The slightest movement while holding the watch with the stem pulled out causes the minute hand to move making it hard to get it aligned with the minute marker. Plus, for a quartz watch, it slows down about a minute a week.I'm thinking it is either defective or they are selling factory seconds."
3,divewatch,"I oredered this watch without really looking at the specs, just the picture. When I got it it was a little small on my wrist and it it wasnt a sweeping second hand like I like so I sent it back an got another for a little more money. I am very happy with Invicta and Amazon for fixing my mistakes."
5,Great product,This watch is in great condition looks just like the picture. No problems with it so far except when I tried to set the time the pin came out completely. I've only had it for a month so far and it works great.
3,No screw down crown as advertised,This watch is very good looking. The face is not huge and looks good. The only problem I have is the description states a screw down crown. Not true. I dont know if this is going to let water come in or not. only time will tell.
5,Beautiful watch,"The pictures they use to show off this watch definitely do not do it justice. The watch itself is a deep violet purple while the outer ring is a light navy blue. Next, the band and the rest of the watch is high-end stainless steel that feels very solid when you wear it.The watch face is surprisingly hard to scratch: I have hit the face on many occasions and it has yet to leave any kind of noticeable wear or tear. Over all, this watch absolutely feels and looks like it's worth much more than 60 bucks. If you want a watch that looks nice and is very affordable, then go with this one. You will be pleasantly surprised."
3,Wrong watch,"I bought this watch and they sent me the 8932A model and the glass. Racked twice within the first two weeks, I'm still trying to figure out the warranty situation"
2,"Good looking, small, stopped working","This is a nice men's watch, but quite small. It's good looking, and a great price on Amazon, but it stopped working after about a day. The mechanism is obviously inexpensive, and I think the crown simply didn't seat properly. (The crown is NOT screw down, as noted in earlier reviews). The good news is that, as usual, it was easy to return via Amazon. I got a slightly more expensive watch from Invicta to replace this one. The new watch is really BIG, and I'll review it separately."
5,Great watch!,"I love this watch! I've had it for about a month now, and it hasn't perceptibly lost any time. It looks great, and I love that the face is almost a deep purple."
3,Not as described,"This watch was okay. The fit and finish weren't bad, though I thought the band was a little light. However, I returned the watch because it was described as having a screw down crown which it does not actually have."
5,stunning,if only oprah could get her hands on this book! Millions would get a chance to know the wonder of Janet Frames' writing. Faces in the Water is one of my favorites. The feeling of being in a mental instution lingers for days after you've finished reading. This is one book I've kept to read again. .
1,Apparently all of you are crazy too,"This book sucks, plain and simple. There is nothing intelligent or thought provoking about it. It reeks of someonee trying way too hard to give it depth and is impossible to read. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."
1,a stunning bit of propaganda,"No question that, from a modern prospective, the vast majority of Stuart monarchs were tragi-comic characters. What is inexcusable is that this book was published with all its anti-Catholic balderdash. It is a motley collection of undocumented assertions and I should have known not to buy this book when I saw it had no bibliography."
4,A very good Scottish view of the Stuarts,"Lots of books have been written about the Stuarts, but this book brings them all together with a Scottish perspective. A good choice for any one who's interested in the period and wants a very readable well written popular history."
3,"BRO. BRANHAM'S PROPHECY OF THE END-TIME, GIVEN TO ME, JUST BEFORE HE DIED!","MAY I SHARE IN RELATION TO THIS BOOK; "" WILLIAM BRANHAM..ADOPTION"", THAT I WAS GRACED TO KNOW AND WORK WITH BRO.

1,Spare Your Ears!,"This is one of the worst, most execrable recordings of early Beatle classics I have ever had the misfortune to hear. The Chipmunks' dreadful falsetto sounds like a record (pre-CD) played at the wrong speed. Their dreadful screeching of Beatle hits is enough to drive you up the first tree. How cruel to treat Beatle songs this way! Get the REAL Beatles instead. You will be very glad that you did.Good marketing ploy - drawing a moptop on a popular character and throwing in a Beatle twist was sure to sell. This however, is a stinker."
5,As always- The ever insightful Larry Williams,"Larry's new book is a must own. His ideas on money mangement, systems testing, and seasonality leave the avid trader with their mouth wide open. This book is truly inspiring."
5,Another excellent book,"As with his ""Definitive Guide to Futures Trading"" Volumes 1 & 2 Larry gives the reader dozens of gems. There is no 'Holy Grail' but there are patterns and other indicators which work on all markets in all time frames. Larry is a teacher. He shows you how an idea is used to generate a system and how to improve it. Everything he shows he invites the reader to go beyond his words and experiment in building your own system. I was a reluctant trader until I used some of his ideas from the ""Definitive Guide to Futures Trading"" series and constructed my own system. I know exactly what everything in that system does and know that it is profitable. I believe that this is what Larry wants every reader to do from his books. I am now retired and trade only 6 months out of the year. Larry gives a money management tool that is worth 100 times the price of the book. Proper money management can make a marginal system a winner. My advise is BUY EVERY BOOK THAT LARRY WILLIAMS HAS WRITTEN!"
2,be carefull,"I was happy and making money slowly and steadily until i read this book. after reading is my account dropped from +50% for the year to +22% so far. his statistics are way over fitted. i realized that once i tested his data. the thing that i never understood is that why do these people keep publishing books if they are making millions. i know the answer now. they are not making millions trading , they are making it selling the book. maybe you can figure a way to make money with his stuff, but i couldn't.best of luck"
2,"Big book, few nuggets","The author has good credentials but I found it very difficult to find much in his book that I could use. Pros: some good stuff on entry and exit points. Cons: book runs on and on, lacks salient points, ends in ""buy on strength, sell on weakness"", ""buy new highs, sell new lows"", and some kind of diary that made no sense at all.Includes a long winded discussion of back tests on futues that was not convincing. My guess is that Larry has some real wisdom, but he needs somebody to help him put it on paper."
3,more of a primer n my opinion of money tree-(code),"This book was a primer too subjects skimmed over in money tree coarse. I would reccommend that a trader especially a newbie start out with ""The money tree or cracking the money code"" they better give you a starting look at the commodity markets and their underlying driving forces. The information in the book is useful but may be potentially dangerous to a inexperienceed trader. So learn the basics first folks."
4,One of the best,"Reckon this book is one of the best you'll ever come across with regard short term trading. Not sure if the times haven't moved on too but no matter, this is the most helpful book I've read on trading.It takes a bit of concentration - that's why I struggled for awhile. There also seem to be a few contradictions here and there but overall, this is a humdinger.If my wife hadn't succumbed to an evil divorce lawyer's blandishments, we'd be on easy st now, courtesy of LTSTSTT.Have read most of Larry's books and this is his best, I think."
2,not very helpful,"In this age of internet, one can get more info from internet than lonely planet about a place such like florida. (if you go to a foreign and strange place, LP may still be essential.)"
5,Love It,"We're in the middle of the big decision/action to move to Florida. Leaving family, friends and relocating a small custom sign business. It's very scarey but this book has pointed out how much we will enjoy the lifestyle. Pennsylvania winters are bruital, we love tropical living, eating and all that goes with it. Swimming, diving, biking, hiking, exploring, etc... Outdoor activities. We've been down several times and this book really hits it on the head."
1,stiff and boring,"Couldn't get into this book, I found the characters morally weak and the pace of the book very slow. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish, not worth my time. It seemed like you were reading a script for a TV show from the 40's or 50's, very dated, stiff and slow."
4,A beautiful poignant story,"I thought this was an exquisitely written book that deals so well with a historical time period in the eyes of a little girl.Ms. Matthews blends the situation of women at the time, the exhilaration of possibilities, the love of flying and the loss of an American icon all into a beautifully crafted whole. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and look forward to more from this very talented author."
1,Horrid,"The bag used to collect tank gunk doesn't hold the finest materials, resulting in extremely cloudy water. I had to clean it by siphon after attempting to clean with the Battery Vac. Also, it's difficult to start. You have to slightly unscrew the battery chamber for the metal contacts to start the motor. Siphoning is far better and safer for the fish."
1,Fish tank vacuum,Not a very good product. Very low-powered item and does not effectively 'vacuum' anything from the tank.
3,Satisfied,"I have used these before, years ago, on smaller tanks. Doesn't reach bottom of 50 gal tank to well, had to extend tube. But, worked just like I remembered, just fine."
2,romantic tailes,I loved the move Ever After but others sokced. They were compleately different from what i expected. Wasted money.
5,"After shopping around, this is the best.","I needed a really good, accurate, no fluff atlas, and I looked very hard, at many books, and even compared to MUCH more expensive ones, this was obviously the best atlas on the market. I ESPECIALLY LIKED THAT THERE WAS A CONSISTANT SCALE USED FOR ALL THE MAPS, SO THAT CERTAIN PARTS OF THE GLOBE WERE NOT NEGLECTED THE WAY EVERY OTHER ATLAS LIKED TO LEAVE THEM. It is so very clear and simple, really easy to use. This atlas made better use of page space, was a more convienient size, and was not as distracting as other cluttered atlases that made maps secondary to photos of natives."
1,Ugh. Buy something else.,"The other reviewer was correct -- it IS a jumble of roads. Atlases should inspire and fascinate. Not this one. It's busy, chaotic, and confusing. Even worse, it offers very poor coverage of remote areas. (In the South Pacific for example, Tahiti is a pin dot and Bora Bora doesn't even exist.) Spend your money elsewhere."
3,"Strongwer than Pride?, ignored piece of Art for the collection?","Must say I love all Sade's albums in good balance, but I think Stronger than Pride should be absolutely added to this collection, because it's the ""half"" of the career that differences the jazzy energy moods of the first 2 albums and the sexy dreamy pop of the last two. Anyway if it should be a package of 3 CD's, I would take out Love Deluxe, and put Stronger than Pride to appreciate better the change of Sade sunny voice to a more natural and quieter mood. Take my opinion easy, these albums are jewels, but I respect the order of the career."
2,balls are a bust,"If you purchase this boat, be prepared to be very disappointed when you open up the package, the balls are not useable, they are all ""squished"". I had to deal directly with the manufacturer to get some resolve with the balls, and even then I had to call them twice. This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson, it's now February, and still it sits, cause the new balls just came in yesterday, doesn't seem to be worth the wait."
2,fun while it lasted,"I was so excited to get this! I blew it up, put my baby inside and he thought it was great! But it quickly got a hole in it..then another..the sides velcro on side and he pulled them off all the time. The other toys did not stay on where they should. The balls were very easily bent in. I was sad to see it go quicker than I expected. :("
1,wont keep air,"We thought this toy would make a great gift, but unfortunatly we used it for about 15 min. and it deflated due to a gash in the side. It came this way it was the worst toy we ever bought for my son."
4,Neat,"This thing is cheap, in price that is. It does what you expect from it. It has a very long cord and winds up easy and unwinds easy, Could not find this locally at this price! Amazon Has comes through again."
1,Sangean model is cheaper and better.,"April, 2012. The Sangean version is now $10.88 and the Kaito is $12.99. Buy the Sangean for better quality. The Kaito model is cumbersome to retract as it is not made well although works fine. You can reel up the Sangean at least five times faster. You will be happier with the Sangean version, believe me."
3,Works..,I use this with my Grundig. My only complaint is that the spool broke and now i cannot wind up the antennae.
3,Works but is cheaply made,"I bought this item to see if it would improve SW reception over the factory whip on my Sony ICF-7600. The Kaito antenna worked as advertised with marginal improvement over the whip. However, the housing shattered upon being dropped three feet onto a carpeted floor. Thirteen dollars seems like too much for a cheap plastic housing and a few feet of wire."
2,"OK, after I fixed it","Unit had no continuity at jack. I cut it aprt, soldered the wires to the jack, and now it works fine. I give it ZERO stars as arrived, 3 stars for function after I fixed it, so 1.5 stars"
2,Not designed for human hands.,"I am very disappointed in the design of the Kaito AN-03L radio antenna. Once unraveled it works great as an antenna, but then go to wind it back up again and the fun begins. It obviously wasn't designed for human hands and fingers. The finger indents on the unit are just to shallow to enable easy winding, it is like trying to wind up a cord using a flat disk. It has become so frustrating that I'm now reluctant to use the unit as I know if I pull the antenna wire out it will take ages to wind it back up again.Kaito needs to resign the unit to facilitate easier winding up."
2,Some improvement,I live in a fringe valley area and it helped a bit. I won't know until the next disaster if it really is going to work.
1,agonising retrive,"who ever designed the antenna and tried reeling the line in must have never gone fishing,it is agonising slow,it should have a handle similar to the dynamo crank on the radio,very poor design,otherwise it does the job,Ray."
2,Didn't help much,"I bought the antenna to try to improve the reception of a small shortwave radio we are taking to Africa, but after hooking it up, I couldn't pick up any more stations or hear any clearer reception than without it. I will try it with a different radio we ordered, but will probably have to return it for a refund."
4,WONDERFUL SPRINGBOARD FOR SELF STUDY AND CONVERSATION,"TEN YEARS AGO ROSE'S ORIGINAL FACE READING BOOK WAS GIVEN TO ME. MY HUSBAND AND I TOOK IT ON VACATION TO A CAMPOUT WITH SOME FAMILY MEMBERS. WE TOOK TURNS READING SECTIONS AND LOOKING AT EACH OTHER CLOSELY . WE HAD SO MUCH FUN LOOKING AT AND DISCUSSING FEATURES THAT WE BEGAN TO SHARE IN MORE PERSONAL AND MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOUR BOOK FOR YEARS. THIS BOOK WOULD BE ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR INITIATING CONVERSATIONS WITH TEENAGERS WHO ARE SO VERY AWARE OF THEIR LOOKS AND LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES . THANK YOU, ROSE FOR THE NEW EDITION AND THE PROMPT REPLY WHEN I ORDERED SEVERAL MORE COPIES."
5,I just couldn't put this book down!,"This book was so much fun to read! Rose is an insightful and delightful author. She is a great ""wordsmith, making this a book that is enjoyable to read not only the first time, but to refer to time and time again. I've purchased several books as gifts to family and friends, and even as door prizes to several organizations I belong to. I would recommend it to anyone!"
3,Not in perfect condition,My pig came with pink paint scratched off the nose. Cute otherwise. Love the tutu and the size was perfect.
3,"Could Be Better (In fact, used to be)","Be warned: this bank is only six inches tall and six inches long. I bought Mud Pie Princess banks several years ago; they were much larger and had more cute details (black Mary Jane shoes, jewels). Also disappointed in the piggie's wrinkled ribbon and in the frayed white fabric lining the box. Guess they just don't make 'em like they used to. Sigh. But it still is a very sweet little bank that, well, is OK (I guess)."
5,LOVE this piggybank,"After purchasing one of these banks for our oldest daughter and then again for our youngest daughter, I ordered this one as a baby shower gift. This bank is very large-which is perfect for me because kids get a lot of change and fill up the smaller ones very quickly. And this bank is by far the cutest, most girly bank I've seen offered anywhere. Mudpie makes another girly bank-which my second daughter got only because I didn't want their banks to be identical-but this one is far superior in adorableness and was the hit at the baby shower."
5,Sensuality At It's Finest,"Love Lingers is a lovers delight. Fresh, leap off the page words capture the reader from the first poem to the last. Kudos to Ms. Grosvenor on a remarkable work."
4,good 80 punk,"new model army was a very underrated 80's punk band. Good songs, good lyrics. Maybe they were bigger in UK than in US. This is maybe their best CD."
3,"Beautifully written, but essentially empty","Hijuelos has displayed many times over that he is a brilliant writer. In this book, he once again shows an amazing abilty with language. Unfortunately, the plot and the characters are so lightweight that they almost float away. You can appreciate this book for the writing and style, but it's nearly impossible to feel emotionally engaged."
2,Snoozer...,"I was so excited to read this book - especially since it has gotten great reviews. My book club read it and we all decided that the idea for the book was great, but the author dropped the ball and never developed the story line. The writing was great and the descriptions interesting, but it got old after a while. This book had so much potential. Oh well, the cover is great..."
2,Never judge a book by its cover..,"This book is impossible to read. It is sooooooo boring. There is really no plot to it, just description after description. I found myself rereading passages thinking ""I'm missing something."" Finally I gave up. Thank God for Borders' book exchange policy."
4,Empress of the Splendid Season for our season as well,"Good insights into Latino culture of the 60s. Written with a sense of humor, but more serious events of the times explained from her point of view. As a teacher of ELL, this helps me connect with parents and grandparents of my students. My kids are from Mexico, not Cuba, but family issues are the same."
3,dissapointing,There is not alot said in this story that hasn't been said before.Mr. Hijuelos was able to protray the Cuban experience in America with Mambo Kings.
4,Great storytelling... about the memories of Cuba,"I really enjoyed the way this author painted a picture of a society girl from the good old days in Cuba who ends up in New York as a cleaning lady. I loved the way she was always such a lady and was always soo concerned with what the neighbors were going to say and that the most important thing was to carry oneself as if they were a person of class.The ending did not do it for me, we end up with Lydia draaming of something totally irrelovent. Even her bosses ending was so blah. I did enjoy it however and am looking forward to reading this authors other books!"
4,A splendid look into Latin American life,Hijuelos has a way with his words that makes this book easy to read and enjoy.The story is interesting and captivating. I really enjoyed his portrayal of Latin Americans.
2,booooooring,"I kept thinking I was missing something, so I would go back to it, but it never kept my attention, and I did not care about the characters. Quite a dissapointment. I would not reccomend this read. I very rarely put a book down before the end, but I have not even hit page 100 and I am done! Oh well..."
4,A beautifully written book of the life of an immigrant woman,"The book is a graceful work about the life of an immigrant family in New York from the 40's to the present day. The book focuses on Lydia, a working class heroine, who goes from being a pampered, spoiled undisciplined rich girl in pre-revolutionary Cuba to a cleaning lady laboring for the well to do of the Big Apple. The book works best when focusing on the every day life of the dozens of every day characters that we meet. Although there is no major out of the ordinary climaxes in the story, Hijuelos' excellent prose makes us see how heroic ordinary life is. I reccommend this book."
3,"The Empress of the Splendid Season, Lydia","It never ceases to amaze me that a male author can ""capture"" the spirit of a female, and represent a female as well as this author does. I also respect his ability to illuminate poverty--what it feels like to be poor, a minority, a stranger in a strange land. This author has much wisdom about the counter-balancing force of a strong worth ethic in this poor woman's life. The striving is melancholy; the mentality of poverty is in part that things will never change. She has a chronic sorrow . . . But Lydia is a lifelong learner, I feel, and a person able to adapt."
4,Loved it,"I can't imagine how other reviewers could call this book boring. I could have read it in one sitting, I just loved it. The period it evokes, the location (NYC), and the window on early Cuba -- all wonderful. Heartbreaking, real, complex, richly detailed, beautifully written. Can't wait to read ""Mambo"" now that I've been exposed to this great writer."
4,Couldn't put it down but....,"I enjoyed reading this book even though it was not in the same category as ""The Mambo Kings"". The story is enjoyable and well-written; however, at the end the reader feels like they never really got to know Lydia's children very well. They are portrayed as stereotypical teenagers for the first 1/2 of the novel and then the daughter all but disappears from the rest of the story. I would have preferred a more in-depth description of those characters."
4,Living an examined life.,"Oscar Hijuelos writes of people with intense rich interior lives. These are people we admire for their emotional constancy and pity for their obsessions. I've read three of Oscar Hijuelos' novels. This is the least engaging of the three, but still a very nice book."
3,Hijuelos goes on auto-pilot,"Not that this isn't a good novel. But with its Cuban immigrants in New York, great writing and not much of a plot, this is a book that the author's already written a couple times before."
4,Intelligent and compassionate,"This is a novel that could be turned into a dramatic and engaging movie along the lines of ""Mambo Kings."" Nothing happens in this or other Hijeulos novels of great magnitude beyond the small circles of characters they embrace. But that's what makes this book great. He does a good job of transporting the reader into the lives of nobody important but who are filled with great dreams and aspirations. And there's enough intelligence and political and social commentary to elevate it beyond the typical hack drama and movie of the week dribble that books like this often are. It won't change the world, but it's an engaging and enjoyable read."
4,Sanguine Secrets,"Saguine Secrets is a passionate story that kept me intrigued. The characters were convincingly intoxicating and you quickly become involved in the story line. Though slow moving at times. I enjoyed the way you never were sure who really was the good vampire and who was one of the Elders. Leila was one vampire I could have slayed myself (taking out my old Buffy the vampireslayer outfit). I do know that once you start reading you will be convinced that this writer can pull you into the vampire world and make you check your own pulse for your heartbeat running through your veins.Shayla McClellon Author of ""Hypnotic"" coming out in 2005"
4,Serengeti Drivers (Lamone),GREAT driver sunglasses. Not too dark - just right. The Serengeti drivers corning glass is nothing short of amazing - just like other Serengeti's. Best glass out there. Contrasty and a great amber shade to everything. You'll like 'em. - JayHutchps: only reason no 5 stars is they are not quite as tough as I'd like. Frame seems flimsy for $100+ sunglasses ($250 store retail) I'm hard on sunglasses and these seem a bit delicate . . . but I haven't broken 'em yet!
2,"Rubber ear piece brittle if left in car heat, Lens chip a corner if glasses are flexed.","I've had two pair of these, while optically they are good, the rubber ear piece hardens and crumbleafter being left in the car in the summar. I had to replace them twice in a year. The lenses chipeasily at the corner by the hinge. especilly if are flexed to adjust curviture. Or ear pieces openedtoo wide. Not very durable."
4,sunglasses review,Lenses darken more than I had hoped for and more than previous serengeti sunglasses I've owned. Fit securely and cover the eyes well from peripheral light. Reasonable value - not great. Delivered fast and packaged securely. Recommend the seller source.
4,Nice video,This video shows highlights from some beautiful ballets performed by the renamed Kirov Ballet at Convent Garden under the presence of Lady Diana and in Red Square under the presence of Russian people. Although most of the numbers chosen are famous I would not say they are essential as the title of this DVD suggest. There are far more important and interesting works which is not included in it. However I would recommend this DVD for those who are just curious about the art of ballet or want to be acquainted with it. The production is careful and the image and the sound are goods. This video is a nice entertainment for the whole family.
3,Bolshoi Essentials,"Seeking recordings of less well known ballets, and presentations of them, this DVD offered some of these works and was eagerly anticipated. It did, I expect, offer 'what it said on the tin', and unfortunately only presented excerpts from the various works, in both the London and Moscow programmes These were fine so far as they went but, because they were just specific scenes, did not have any significant stage settings, or any placement of them into the context of the full ballet storyline. This is to be expected from the title 'Essential' I presume but it was disappointing.I had specifically wanted the ballet 'Diana and Actaeon', even as an early version, to compare it to the recent Royal Ballet 'METAMORPHOSIS', triple production.Still, worth the watching for passionate balletomains."
1,"changed recipe, poor customer service","I bought a case of 12 cans of fish, chicken & liver for my kitty, since she did well with the previous case. When the new case came, I realized that the recipe was changed. I thought I would still try it with my kitty. Then the disaster started. She threw up every single time she ate this food. I tried to get in touch with Petguard customer service, since they promise ""satisfaction guaranteed"" (written clearly on the can). It took them several days to get back. We emailed back and forth several times. I clarified what the problem was and we discussed the possibility of trying some other flavors since they didn't have the old recipe any more. Then, they STOPPED RESPONDING COMPLETELY. It's been three weeks since they responded to my email last time. I called multiple times. They kept promising that they would respond to my email - but NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.BAD RECIPE, RUDE, IRRESPONSIBLE SERVICE. NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,Worst Training CD's I ever experienced,"If you are looking for SQL 2005 training these CD's are not worth it. I give you the following problems:-Many of the concepts are covered by him reading from books-on-line word by word with no additional explanation.-In the permissions tape he actually had an error, tried to figure it out, then moved on without an explanation or fixing the problem.-The instructor speaks very, very slow and there is no way to accelerate the recording. Sometimes there is at least a minute of nothing happening. Drives me crazy.-He shows you things, but gives no explanation of what they are or how to use it. He simply points it out, for instance, a scrollable list, he scrolls through the list so that you can read what's on the list and then moves on to the next topic.I could go on and on and on, but I think you get the idea. The author may be very knowledgeable in SQL, but he is not a trainer. Don't waste your money."
2,"Good in places, but very forced",While the premise and beginning of this book are very plausible it soon breaks down. The author appears determined to create a situation where the CSA & USA will combine against Britain regardless of how silly the action required to do this. I am also struck by the very uncharacteristic behavior of Grant in this book. One of the most fluid generals ever is portrayed fighting incompetants in the same way he was forced to fight Lee.
3,a good premise is not very well put together,"This is a book that is started with a great premise, and is only undermined by the author's hurried attempts to tie it all up in the end. Too fast, too fast. The beginning of the book is great, and if the text had been expanded another 50 to 100 pages, this would have been a much better read. The British are fairly real. As a BS in Anthropology I can tell you that at that time most british royalty were very interested in the American Civil war, and its repercussions abroad. As for the utter agressiveness shown by Victoria and her ministers, it is way over the top. While there were many wars in that time fought to expand and keep the borders of the Empire, they were not THAT bull-headed. Overall, this is a good read, just don't believe how ""real"" it could be."
1,From the sublime to the ridiculous,"How can this Harry Harrison be the same one who wrote the masterful King's Way series? Mr. Harrison is apparently more comfortable and familiar with the distant past than with the relatively recent. I have seldom seen a worse example of ""alternate history."" As we've often been told, the key to alternate history is that it must be plausible. S&S is certainly not plausible in plot, characters, or sentence structure. Perhaps the safest thing for Mr. Harrison's fans to do is to view this as fantasy, not alternate history, and thereby give him (and themselves) a break from the link to reality that ""alternate history"" implies. Or perhaps they should do as I have done: choose to believe that an evil force from a parallel timeline has substituted a poor imitation of a good writer for the genuine article."
1,This book was hugely disappointing.,"As a Civil War buff and alternate history addict, I found this book to be a huge disappointment. The premise of U.K. intervention as a result of the Trent affair is a good one, but that is the only positive thing I can say about this work. The dialogue was dreadful, the characters unconvincing, the research slip-shod, and the editing worse. The story-line, with its preposterous British invasion of the South, transcendantly goofy North-South reconciliation, and bizarro Victoria just made me wince. It simply was an insult to the genre."
2,"Enjoyable, but really really stupid","Ok so the premise for the book is a good one, one star earned there. But the execution is retarded. For one, HH has the United States progress through four years of industrialization in a matter of months, completely ignoring the obvious impossibilities of such a rapid change in 1861. Second, how the hell could three/four corps conquer America and reincorperate the Americans back into the British empire, the limeys were not stupid as they are in this book. Basically the book completely devolves into a series of mindless drivel, entertaining drivel, one star."
1,"Interesting Idea, Poor Execution","It's weird. Harrison obviously did _some_ research. So why did he not go the full length to make it accurate? There are many, many problems with the ships in the book, problems that could have easily been fixed if he had bothered to find a single good reference book. The Warrior in the book is not the same ship as in real life and would have been far more than a match for the Monitor. For that matter, the Monitor succeeds because the British are ""strawmen"", designed specifically to fail. I didn't take as much offense at the North and the South joining forces against Britain (when the actual Trent Affair occured, some members of Lincoln's cabinet actually thought a war with Britain might bring the two sides together), but its execution in the novel is rather hackneyed.I didn't bother with the other books in the series. I was totally turned off by this one. Go read something by Harry Turtledove if you want Civil War alternative history."
2,Good idea. Poor execution.,"This trilogy starts with a good concept but delivers it so badly........Characterisation (mostly of the British) isn't even two dimensional; they are poor stereotypes at best. But even the Americans are flat and lifeless.Also, if an author is going to write about historical warfare it behoves him to do some research, the number of simple errors in these books is terrible.Amusing but not worth the effort."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was hoping for a much more belivable alternative history. The point of divergence was an excellent one -- the British almost did go to war with the U.S. over the Trent Affair. But even if the British were to accidently attack the Confederacy instead of the Union, would they just say ""hey, what the heck"" and continue on and battle both sides? Utter foolishness. I couldn't take this novel seriously after that. Skip this one and stick to Harry Turtledove's works in alternate history."
1,"I know Turtledove, and this is no Turtledove","I won't go into a lot of detail, just say...yechhh. The characters are wooden, the dialogue stilted, and his research is sloppy. I might buy the next two volumes (but not in hardcover!); the novel was interesting in a traffic-accident sort of way."
4,"Excellent story, but with a few weak spots","An excellent alternate-history book. What else would one expect from Mr. Harrison? The master of the genre proves himself yet again. The book tells a tale of the war between the states as it would have been if England had intervened on the Confiderate side. The story is very historically correct, and even the fiction part stays amazingly close to facts. The book does get a little too-romanticized towards the end - the Union army performs wonders even though they are in a very bad position. One thing I do not like is that the English are shown to be rather clumsy and stupid. Still, it is an excellent book - I swallowed it in a weekend."
1,A self imposed tax on stupidity,"To avoid paying this tax, resist buying this turkey of a book and donate the money to a deserving charity instead.Alternatively buy it and treat it as a pot-boiling, dashed-off-by-dictation-in-a-weekend exercise in satire directed at the alt.hist fiction genre."
2,Meh,"I am a fan of alternate history and have a couple of issues with this book. First, even before the English attack, the Union feels like it is being set up with a perfect hand to beat the stuffing out of England Spoilers <<(the repeating rifles, a better monitor, monitor not sinking...)>> End Spoilers Second and more to the point, your view hops from one historic character at a moment of key crisis to another. There is no sense of people and as a result, little engagement."
1,Do your research,"The research that went into this series of books was very poor. The weapons, geography, historical figures, and units were completely misrepresented. There was no sense of time in the story, either. A ship or unit would cover hundreds of miles in a day or two just to fill in a plot point. This might be a minor point for others, but it was a major sticking point for me. A glaring example of this is the casualties reported at the Battle of Shiloh. 22,000 casualties is a world apart from 22,000 dead. If you are going to write about something, you had better do your research or you will look like an imbecile. The writing itself was dreadful, too. Save your time, read something, anything, else."
1,Horrendous,"I can believe the premise of England becoming involved in the ACW over the Trent affair. I can even believe the Uion Armies being able to defeat the Engish because they are battle tested and adapting to the new tactic while the British have not. What I can't believe is the mistaken attack on Biloxi MS and and the simplistic answer to the slavery question. To me it shows a complete lack in understnding the whole issue by the author. The next problem I have with the book is the dialoge. It is atrocious. Nobody uses any kinds of contractions and very little slang. The typos are horrible. At one point a common soilder to lamenting on all his friends killed and he thinks about ""all his Butties"" I am just glad I got this book from the library and didn't have to pay for it. However, I will probably read the next 2 books to see if they get any better."
2,Definitely NOT vintage Harrison,"I have read and enjoyed most Harry Harrison books, but this one came to me so full of grammatical errors and horrid misspellings that I must conclude that the day of the proofreader is done. There is too much philosophizing and a rather overdone glorification of William Tecumseh Sherman, as well as more than enough of Grant's drinking problem. How could Sherman have commanded the respect of Lee (who was not at the time of the story, however historically distorted, ""Commander in Chief of the Confederate Army"")? Lee was Commander of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1861, 62, 63. It is easy to believe that we beat the British in less than a year after the ""Battle of Biloxi,"" but distortions of history are little use unless preceded by true history. Irishness must be catching!"
2,This book requires far too great a leap of faith.,Harry Harrison starts out with a promising premise but it quickly falls apart in an ever growing string of preposterous events. For any student of history or fan of alternate history that is intrigued by the possibilities that may have been brought about to history by the altering of one or two events this is not the book for you. The author makes great leaps of faith in most of his assumptions (leaping over any type of logic most of the time) about what would have happened if Britain would have entered the Civil War. The image of Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart riding into New York to save the Union army of U.S. Grant from the evil invading British ravaging hordes brandishing Spencer repeating rifles just boggles the mind. Overall a book better left to those who enjoy pure fantasy.
5,"A wonderful, well-written book","This book shows how the American Civil War could have evolved differently if Great Britain (at the time the world's superpower) would have become involved. It vividly describes scenes of war and politics. Once you read, it is hard to put it down. It might be - as I read in another review - a bit Anglophobe, but given the colonial record of Britain I think it is not 'over the top'."
3,A Light Hearted American Future History Set In The 1860's,"Harry Harrison establishes an intriguing premise in ""Stars And Stripes Forever"", yet isn't nearly as successful as Harry Turtledove in its execution. The problems are the length of the story and its characters. I found this too quick a read, and none of the characters, especially the historical ones, are truly memorable. Instead, Harrison has chapters that are actually vignettes, as one improbable scene after another unfolds. Fortunately, he gets a bit better in the sequel, ""Stars And Stripes In Peril"", but those who are looking for another substantial effort akin to Harry Turtledove's may be in for a major disappointment."
2,Why?,"This was at one point a decent DBZ anime movie. However, Funimation feels that in addition to changing voice actors, they needed to change the music and dialogue as well. The original music, from the Pioneer version, was much more energetic and well timed. Also: while Gohan's song was slightly annoying and in a language inaccessable to many people throughout the world, it's still better than Gohan laughing inanely. If you wish to purchase this, buy the Pioneer version."
4,"Yo, not that special","This is simply a revervsioning by FUNimation. Though Pioneer released edited only episodes, their DBZ movies were UNCUT. I know for a fact because I own the Pioneer DVD ans it has English and Japanese audio, that you can even switch back and forth during video play. FUNimation is just redubbing it and replacing the original Japanese soundtrack that Pioneer left alone. You can buy the Pioneer version right now, probably for less than ten dollars."
1,Rather Boring,This book was rather boring and so is the next one. I think it is because roger lea macbride didn't totally write this himself. He passed away before he finished these two books.
3,Not too shabby,"For the price its not that bad, wish the belt buckle was a little more high quality. From a far doesn't make that much of a difference but on close inspection the cheaper quality shows. Elastic is pretty good, retains its elasticity after repeated use.You get what you pay for."
2,"Good Information, Distasteful Writing","This book is certainly an excellent beginner's reference on the use and procurement of common kitchen herbs and spices. However, the author's apparent Euro-centric and misogynist personal beliefs permeate his writing. Throughout the book, the author makes several distasteful comments that, unfortunately, significantly detract from otherwise good writing."
3,"Fairly thorough, but unimpressive","This book has a lot of spices in it, and some useful features. I love the the alternate names for spices in different languages. That's nice. But I rarely use it, otherwise. Much of the info seems pretty haphazardly assembled and largely untested, to be honest. Not bad, just not as handy and fascinating as i'd imagined it would be."
4,great product,"The item was shipped and processed as described. I have no problem with this device, it works just as it should."
1,worthless,it must be an old cartridge because there is no color. everything i print comes out brown. it is worthless.
1,LD remanufactured are c__p,These cartridges are not worth spitting on. I taped a quarter on mine and threw them away so I could say I had thrown something away. A total waste of money! That is my take.
3,Color of Absence,"I read the story ""Summer of Love"" by Annette Curtis Klause. I thought it was a really good short story. I like this story because it is funny and I think vampires are cool because they are wicked. I thought is was sad because Simon was alone until he meets a cat. Then when the cat died he was alone again.:( Other kids in my class think the story is sad, but they liked it too. :("
2,Invicta 9177 Women's Diver,"I bought this for my wife. I liked the look and styling of the watch. However, I bought it for her to use the bezel to time her exercise. I had a heck of a time turning the bezel. Also, the seconds hand was not aligned well with the seconds ticks around the dial - did not like that as well. I sent it in for warranty repair and it was returned with both items not repaired. I guess this level of quality was found to be normal for this watch."
3,Bezel features completely faded off,"I bought this watch for it's diveability--ability to be taken underwater, and to use the bezel for timing runs and dives.I bought it in April--less than three months later, the numbers and color of the bezel have completely washed away.It has been fine otherwise, but if you're specifically looking for the bezel functionality, it appears you'll need to look elsewhere."
1,"Mediocre product, terrible service","Bought this watch as a present for my girlfriend Dec 2009. I know wasn't buying a Rolex but I did expect it to last at least a few months or gasp, at least 1 year! 6 months on the dot, the bezel falls off. We didn't even notice until later as it wasn't dropped or bumped against anything, it just fell off. Shoddy manufacturing I guess. As usual I guess for these types of companies, nothing is actually covered under the warranty so the bezel will need to fixed at an extra charge, in addition to the shipping and handling fees, which come out of the customer's pocket. All in all, it will require 50% of the purchase price just to get this fixed as the warranty does not cover anything. Stay away from Invicta watches, you're better off buying a 10$ Timex from your corner store. Heck, you're better off buying with a dollar store watch in terms of value for the money!"
2,Doesn't last 1-2 months,"I just noticed this weekend that the pin that holds the saftey clasp has a broken end, meaning it could fall out at any time and render the clasp useless. I will update this review as I go through the customer service process with Invicta. Screw their warranty, I'm not paying $25 for them to fix a pin, I simply want to return my watch and wash my hands of Invicta (see below).On a side note, the 8932 (men's version) didn't survive being worn in the shower the first month. No moisture was seen inside the dial, but at almost one month after receiving it, the watch simply stopped working. Fortunately Amazon took it back."
3,Watch for swimming,"I wanted a watch for swimming, hot tub, steam sauna and the shower. Unfortunately, I found out later that the watch should not be exposed to warm/ hot water, so much for the hot tub and sauna. The rubber seals are not made for warm/hot water. It was suggested to me however, that the watch really wasn't that expensive and I should just use it as I like. I must admit I am tempted but I still take it off when I am in the hot tub and sauna. One should also note that the watch is not easy to read in the dark. I cannot imagine using this in deep, dark water, the numbers do not glow."
5,Invicta Pro Diver,"Just got back from my first dive trip with this watch and loved it! I did a total of 12 dives and got down to 100 feet, took many swims in the pool, ocean and hot tub and did not have a single issue with this watch. My boyfriend had a fancy, expensive watch - which got water in it and stopped working after the first dive. The bezel was easy to use to note when the dive started and ended. I actually wear the watch every day now as I absolutely love it. I have to admit that I'm not one to wear any jewelry in the water and it was very cool to never have to worry about this watch - and to always know what time it was - whether we were 60 feet underwater or hanging out in the hot tub!"
3,SMALL watch,"This watch is nice, but very small!!!! I have a tiny wrist but the watch still looked too dainty for my taste."
5,terrific watch,"Bought this watch for my partner. She loves it. She is very active and wears the watch when she plays golf and kayaks. It's tough, durable and stylish."
1,That Song In The Preview,"i have neither seen the movie, nor heard this soundtrack, but i am writing to identify the first song in the TV previews, as it plagued me when i could not find it. the song is Franz Ferdinand 40' and can be found on the last track of their self titled album. i hope this helps anyone else who was searching for the name."
2,Why are the Shins forgotten again?,"I watched the movie and loved it, great music in the movie as well. I am now wondering why the best and most moving songs in the movie aren't on the soundtrack. I finally hear some of my favorite bands on the big screen and they don't even have them on the soundtrack. If you are expecting to hear half the songs you listened to during the movie, this product is not for you."
1,Actual movie soundtrack way better,I saw this movie and despite not really liking it I fell in love with the soundtrack while watching. I told myself immediately I would buy the soundtrack.And disappointed I was. Don't you hate that? The song I most enjoyed Cannonball by Damien Rice wasn't even on the soundtrack.Very disappointed.
4,Lovin' it,"I loved the soundtrack to this movie, the music just enhanced the movie so much more. One minor problem is the fact that they left ""Cannonball"" by Damien Rice off of this album...its one of my favourite songs and really captured a poignant part in this movie."
3,In Good Company,"How could they not include ""Cannonball"" by Damien Rice on the soundtrack? It's such a great song and was perfect for it's scene in the movie. I'd rate the soundtrack higher if it had been included."
2,Where are the Shins!!!,"Come on there were at least two Shins' songs in the movie!! Both were from Chutes too Narrow, just in case you were looking."
2,Too Much Missing,This soundtrack released does not do the soundtrack of the movie justice. There are too many terrific songs missing. Who needs the instrumental stuff. We want the real songs with vocal artists. If a sample is good enough for you then this will do. It is not for me.
4,Amazing!,"This was a really great book. I just finnished it last night, I couldn't put it down. I love Madeline Baker, she is my favorite writer. This book was so interesting and exciting, I was amazed by her detail and gift for writing."
1,Ugh!!,If I could've given this book no stars I would've. I couldn't finish it. There was just no kind of passion between the two main characters. The story just dragged and dragged. I kept hoping it would pick up but it didn't. Sorry!!
5,:),Good book! I always love to read a good native American romance and this one did not fail me. Will read more of Madeline Baker.
4,lakota love song,This was a fun read if you are looking for a romantic novel. Some of the love scenes could be a little less suggestive. The story is well written though.
3,Lakota Lacking,"I'm sorry but this book was very disappointing. I tried to like it, kept reading thinking it would get better...it had to. Well, it didn't! I've been reading these types of books since 1980 and have several I keep and read over and over...this was not one I would read again. It had no backbone, no substance! I thought the characters were predictable and weak. The romance part lacked passion and grit. After just reading ""Comanche Moon"" and ""Comanche Heart"" by C. Anderson, I'm surprised I was even able to finish this book. I have to say I am disappointed in Madeline Baker because I know she can do so much better. I'll still turn to her books, but I hope they aren't lacking like this one was."
3,Unlikely story,"Though the story goes along in the beginning at a realistic pace it continues by putting the male 'hero' in the most unlikely of spots, gives the Lokata credit for being loving and caring people and then allows them to do some of the most ghastly things imaginable. Even though the actions are somewhat understandable the two distinct side of the people don't work. The woman lead is exposed to all these things and they would be enough to make a her go insane. However, the final outcome of the story is so misquided in its premise that I simple gave up on the book."
4,Back to School with Franklin,"Got this for my grandson, age 4. I didn't see it; his mom said he liked it."
3,Need Better Hardware,Ordered the bags then realized I needed the support brackets as well. Bags come with strings to attach to the brackets and instruction mention zip ties. Not good or sturdy. I bought 3/8 metal hose clamps and attached them to the bracket then drilled (2) holes thru the bags and bolted them with fender washers to the claps. Bags don't flop around. Bags look good but attaching them to the brackets could be done better. Strings and zip ties are tacky and not very secure.
1,Bad Choice,Fragile product!!!It is not a product made to last!There are many other options in the market that makes a good job!
2,Ok,"These worked great for a couple of months, and then they broke. Next time I might spend more to get a better product."
5,bubble bobble review,"DUDE!! This game is completely SWEET!! it has absolutly NO plot BUT IT ROCKS (like pac-man but not as good) your a green dinosaur in a world of many levels you have the ability to ex-hale bubbles thats how you trap baddies!! then you jump on them and they die it will SUCK YOU IN YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STOP!! it's techno style music will make you wanna crank it up IT ALMOST NEVER ENDS AND TAKE IT FROM ME YOU dON'T WANT IT TO!! don't be fooled by bubble bobble 2 the original is much better,theres a 2-player mode thats story mode with 2 people thats a rare but exelent feture. by all means BUY THIS GAME!!"
3,A bit dated but a must-have for the Ghost Town and mining buff's library,"Most of the book was written 40 years ago and recently revised. Any ghost town or mining buff worth his or her salt has probably read most of this before, either from the author's original articles from which this book is mostly comprised or from other authors rehashing the same material or quoting the content as a source.Still, this is a great original source and worth the price for the photo reprints and stories of the rough and tumble Gold Rush. The author manages to cover the highlights of the Gold Rush and its classic stories in a very readable way without resorting to quoting monotonous figures for gold and ore production in tons and millions of dollars as a way to add filler.A good read and worth adding to the library but probably a bit too dated to use as a travel guide, best for reference."
4,ranaissance steps out again with their pretty-housy-trance,"This album is another very good buy from Renaissance club in UK. These guys are pumping out quite a few melodic tracks. I call this genre ""housy trance"" because the music is definitely trance, but at times with vocals and other effects on top of everything, which are more common for house music. Very danceable, clean mixes, lots of build-ups and ambient breaks. If the album was slightly harder and less cheesy it would deserve full five stars...:=)"
4,Good Book - Good Recipes,"I like a good mystery book and I really enjoy cooking. I got both in this book. This is the first Diane Mott Davidson mystery book that I have ever read. I have read Mary Higgins Clark and Lucille Braun mysteries and ran out of mysteries to read so I bought one of Diane's books. I tried the Anniversary Burgers and they were great! Actually, I would give it a 4 1/2!"
4,"1/2 Jessica Fletcher, 1/2 Julia Child","This series is half Jessica Fletcher and half Julia Child with maybe a dash of Jan Karon, thrown in too. Foolish and light, but well written with (mostly!) believable characters. A trip to Aspen Meadows can be dangerous, especially to your diet."
1,Not even close to a good read,"Though it lacks a plot and any sense of mystery or suspense, the author is quite good at developing a whole host of characters to dislike -- including (and especially) Goldy, the protagonist. She is a helpless complainer, but manages to be judgmental and an overbearing Mom at the same time; who, one week after being overcome by sorrow at the loss of her boyfriend of one month, is upset to have her son interupt her grope session with her ex-boyfriend. I made it 2/3 of the way through before giving up on the book -- save yourself the trouble. . ."
3,Great Title but not enough,"I have enjoyed this series but I was quite dissapointed with this book. The title is attractive. The beginning of the book and the plot development is fine. But the further I got into the book, the more far-fetched the plot. The first half of the book was well written and the who-dunnit solution was unplausable. I felt like Davidson didn't know how to end her story and rushed it. But don't judge the whole series on this one book."
3,Lacking something...,"I really enjoyed this book, but it lacked something I found in the first book. It seemed to go on and on without much happening and then it all ran together in the end. Like others have said, the murder seemed far fetched, especially when the entire plot was exposed.I would recommed it if you're reading the series, but if you're just looking for a cozy mystery, I would suggest ""Catering to Nobody"", the first in the series."
3,"Not as good as ""Catering to Nobody,"" but still pretty good!","I'm reading Mott-Davidson's books in order. I really liked ""Catering to Nobody,"" where Goldy and her menagerie were introduced.I liked this story, but felt it was a little weak in the development of the ""bad guys.""I'm going to keep reading, however, because I like Goldy, Arch, and their assorted friends.To me, the murder and mayhem is almost secondary to Goldy's story -- bringing up Arch and making her way in the world without the JERK....Goldy's a person I would like to know, so I'm going to keep reading until I get to the latest (The Grilling Season)."
2,Who cares about such a wuss?,"One sad association I've made as a voracious reader is that series with clever titles tend to have boring, unimaginative stories. It looks like coming up with the clever title used up the author's creative juices, and this is an unfortunate example.I quit the first book in the series because I couldn't care about such a wimpy character as Goldy, so Davidson never made me care about what happened to her. This book had the same problem, although once again it uses correct spelling and grammar. I also saved and tried the Chile Relleno Torta recipe and it was delicious!"
2,Not as good as some of the later books,"After floundering through a few of the later books, I finally decided to go back and read Goldy's story from the beginning. It was strange to hear about the characters in their ""before"" stages, but it was engrossing enough that the weirdness wore off after awhile. I don't think the characters, at this point, are particularly well developed, and the peripheral characters are a little flat and rough about the edges, but then, I'm comparing it to her later books. I definitely think this is a story line that gets much better as it goes along. And you don't really have to start at the beginning and read them in sequence to enjoy the story."
3,OK all around Industrial Maintenance,Its hard for me to review this book since this is my first and only experience with this subject matter. The book seems to touch on a lot of different subjects but not alot of explicit detail covering any one particular subject. Seems OK for introductory facilities maintenance beginners.
3,Glad I bought 2!?,"I purchased 2 filters for two different cars and am glad I did. The one filter came with no instructions, not that they are needed for install, but they do explain cleaning instructions with a Fram cleaning oil not mentioned on the site and notice stickers for service technicians to not replace filter. Overall, I might not have bought them if I knew that consumables were needed, but after rebate - I didn't buy them, they were free. Much cheaper than disposable filters."
4,Minimal Getz But Still Swell,"While Stan Getz may only be featured on some of the tracks on this release, the other stuff is still great. The Lighthouse All-Stars were a more than capable ensemble and their standards are lively and entertaining. The tracks that do feature Getz are incredibly fresh and worth the purchase price alone."
1,painted bulb,Clear yellow glass would be nice. 100 watts inside of a bulb PAINTED yellow gives about 15 watts of light!
4,Great Chinrest,"The chinrest fit nicely on my full size violin. It is comfortable, and can be easily fitted and removed from the violin."
1,"Too small, and flimsy to boot.","The clamps on this chinrest won't open wide enough for my fiddle, which had a perfectly decent ebony chinrest that wasn't designed to straddle the tailpiece as I wished. Alas, the Wittner looked like it might just make it if I scraped off the cork padding. But, no, still not wide enough. Now I have a chinrest without cork pads to donate to my local school. I hope the kids aren't too hard on the chinrest, though, the Wittner is rather flimsy.So...check to see if it will fit before you buy, and think about spending your money on ebony or rosewood instead of thin plastic with very slender mounting screws (under those black screw covers)."
4,Ballet for Children and grownups,"I loved this dvd. For the very young however, it is a bit long and as there is no audio they would need to know the stories. The scenery, costumes, and dancing were outstanding."
3,My Childhood Nightmare,"I give this 3 stars because it may indeed have some wonderful ballet that I could (or did not) appreciate as a kid. If I were to watch it now, I may have a different opinion.I am 100% serious about this.I don't know how young I was when my mother rented this for me. It terrified me. I had recurring nightmares involving the creepy heads. So much so that I still remember it, some 25 years later.If your child is sensative to strangers in costumes with expressionless heads, like the Easter Bunny, Chuck E. Cheese (such as I was) please take this into consideration."
4,Great Nutcracker alternative,"I saw this film when it first came out in theaters back in the day. The costumes, scenery and music are still wonderful. The dancing is a miracle since the characters caper in costumes that fully realize the animals of Beatrix Potter. To see the cat dance with a tail and full skirt is amazing since her vision is obscured by the big cat mask. An excellent film for young kids who will be enchanted by these animal personalities. Each dance is like a little book so you can start and stop the film if you have a short attention span kid.I was disappointed in the quality of the video. The color in the theater was outstanding. In this video version there are scenes so dark that you cannot see the dancing. Some of the country side is murky also. I am watching on a computer so that may be my problem. If you are in the same techno boat rent the film anyway. There are enough great dance sequences that are visible to make watching this worthwhile."
1,very boring,It did not have dialogue and the characters were ridiculous. only watched the first ten minutes. not worth the time.
1,Ballet -,I'm sorry - the ballet was beautiful and the costumes great- but a little to dry for my four year old.
3,Accidental PUrchase,I did not know I would not receive this dvd at home. Any way I can get the dvd mailed to me?
3,good at the time,i had this game way back when it came out and was a really good game at the time but now it really stinks compared to all the new stuff
3,Possibly adequate but there's a better bet.,"I started with this unit, it immediately failed, the company that's absorbed Back to Basics was quick to send me a new one in exchange for my defective one. In the meantime, I picked up the comparably priced Hamilton Beach Personal Blender. I'm now alternating the two every other day.It's no contest. The Hamilton Beach may be a simpler and lighter, wimpier-looking machine, but it's an infinitely superior design and is deceptively powerful. It's quick, handy, and clean! With the Hamilton Beach, you're not turning the cannister upside down, screwing and unscrewing different covers on it for each use, and best off all there's no spill-over and drippage every time you use it (a good day is one on which, after using the Blender Express, I don't have goopy pants and a sticky car seat by the time I make it to the job)."
1,defective+poor warrantee service,"After using the machine a couple dozen times, it started making a lot of (extra) noise and smelled of burning wire insulation. Back to Basics has farmed out their warranty repairs, and that company, Focus Electric of West Bend, WI, informed me they are backed up with work (no response to their receipt of the item two weeks ago)."
3,You get what you pay for,"<Sigh> I'm nearly 60 years old and have yet to learn that lesson. I bought this to replace a blender I broke, which I used to make yogurt smoothies (juice, yogurt, banana, frozen blueberries, peanut butter). This blender is not very powerful, so the blueberries are chopped rather than pulverized. I'll buy a blender with more wattage. Also, when you are deciding, check out the part of the blender base that the holder fits in. If it's plastic or rubber, it's easy to not seat the holder perfectly, and the rubber will get stripped out--which is what happened to my other blender and could happen with this one--and there is no way to replace that part, so the whole unit has to be thrown away. Metal parts are of course more expensive, but you might as well buy one blender in your lifetime as opposed to several.Update: After two months the rubber gasket on the lid has stretched and no longer fits tightly. I'll buy a different blender, since it's something I use daily."
4,Does the job better than some others,"My last Back to Basics blender lasted only about 6 months, but I bought another one anyways. I like the size of the cup - quite large. I also like that it has more than one speed unlike some other blenders that are similar."
4,Nice Product,"I use my blender for protein shakes and it works very well chopping frozen fruit and mixing. The product does exactly what it says it will do; however, I didn't think about the fact that some of your contents will get stuck at the top when you turn it over to blend. You sometimes have to do a little shaking to get everything down to reach the blade. I still give it 4 stas though since it does work very well."
4,Great for protein shakes,I've had this little blender for a couple of years and use it 5-6 days a week to make a protein shake. It does a great job with cut up slices of apples and a small amount of crushed ice.I'm reordering another one so I have it in reserve.
5,"Powerful, convenient blender","I love making things with blenders, but I absolute hate the clean-up (especially since I usually make single servings). This makes it incredibly easy to make a single serving to go, with a very quick cleanup. The cup is probably a little larger than I need, but it's very secure and not messy. Highly recommended if your needs are like mine (quick, easy, convenient)."
1,this isn't what it says it is,"the description claimed this was ""The true stories of six ordinary Americans"" when in fact it was not. instead, it was some dopey girls gone wild type crap. don't get it."
4,Worht the price I paid...and still pay.,"I love the look of these chairs. I like the height as well. They were pretty easy to assemble (for a chick.. not sure about the guys)My only complaint on the chairs is the finish. Every greasy-child-hand smudge is apparent. They have a glossy/satin like finish and every spec of food or lint can be seen across the room. So, if you are like me and don't get into scrubbing kitchen stools after every meal.. then make your husband.. because they are still worth the value. :D"
4,Very pleased with chairs,"These are not superb quality chairs - not surprising, given the price tag - but they function perfectly fine as my breakfast bar chairs. Sturdy, easy to clean. They have a slight sheen to the finish, but unlike a previous reviewer, fingerprints are not visible on mine."
5,The book of wisdom,"This novel might very well be the Philosophy Textbook of our times, and thus, a literary masterpiece. With only eight circus performers, an impresario and a pig, David Toscana explains with wisdom why our societies do not work, why our world is going crazy, why some things I don't want to mention happen. In an allegorical, apocalyptical, and even humorous way, every social issue is covered: religion, sexism, racism, media, poverty, the military, xenophobia, ecology, health, aging, politics, injustice, solitude, despair and more. The human condition -not the circus- is the greatest show on Earth, but just until we all go to hell."
1,very complicated and ambiguous....,I really recommend to everyone not to read this book.because it's not well explained and very hard reading.that's one of the most complicated and ambiguous books that I ever read.it's not a suitable book for students who want to learn nonlinear dynamics in any level at university.
3,Fragile material,I bought one of these and a Lee's net breeder. I like the Lee's brand much better than this one. The plastic is flimsy and the net even worse. I thought I was going to rip the net as I gingerly put it on the plastic frame! And I didn't get all the tiny plastic grass things -the picture shows 5 or 6 sturdy ones; I got only 3 (that also looked & felt as if they'd fall to pieces).
4,"A good book, spoiled by typesetting on the Kindle","I came on this book while reading a review for a different title. What the reviewer said piqued my interest; the description on Amazon was so-so at best. I made use of the Kindle's free preview and placed my order promptly.This is a sprawling book, tying together past and future nicely. The storyline holds one's interest, the writing is better than average for the genre, and I sat up all too late at night finishing the thing. Unfortunately the translation to the Kindle was unkind to the contents. Most sentences contain at least one hyphenated word, with the break coming in an obtrusive place. Most Kindle books obviously never went through a spell checker, but the visual jarring from innumerable hyphens makes for a less-than-pleasant reading experience."
4,"Excellent Book, only one issue.","I found this book to be a really enjoyable read. The story line is fast-paced enough to keep you interested, and at the end the author does a good job of both completing the story and yet leaving you wanting more.I liked the story line being told in two different time periods.My complaint had nothing to do with the story. The Kindel version has a LOT of words that are erroneously hyphenated. Throughout the entire book, words in the middle of a sentence that should not be hyphenated, are. It really dis-rupted the flow of read-ing for a while. Eventually you learn to read through the for-mat issues, but for a full priced ver-sion of an e-book, I would expect better.See what I mean?4.5 stars for the story, 2.5 for the formatting."
4,One small problem with the Kindle version,"The story is excellent, but with the Kindle version a lot of the words are hyphenated in odd places because they were at the edge of the page in the original written copy.However it is not the same with the Kindle screen, therefore some words are hyphenated in the middle of a sentence in the middle of a page, e.g. - (""chip on your shoul-der""; ""clock ticking above the com-puters"" for example. This can be very distracting, especially if you're tired.Beyond that, a great story!"
4,"Clever, well researched alternate history of the Moon landing","Red Moon is an engaging story that blends a very well researched alternate history of the Soviet Moon shot program with an equally compelling near future energy crisis. The attention to detail and character development of the 60's era Soviets were the strong points, the tension between the astro/cosmonauts characters on the Moon was the weakest point. Events on the Moon read like fiction while the alternate past read like fact. No spoilers, but the fate of a certain main character was very dramatic. The author could have easily taken a more simplistic route but instead gave the characters conclusion a worthy narrative."
5,Phenomenal.,"Words fail to describe how brilliant this book is. A fantastic and very satisfying plot, completed with a brilliant and conclusive ending. Definitely recommend this to others, particularly Science-Fiction fans."
1,Very Disapointing,I met Tom Patiri at a martial arts show. After speaking with some of his associates I decided to purchase the book. What a laugh. The tips are as common as look both ways before crossing the street The greatest laugh I had after skimming through the book was the made up stories. My wife and me said there was no way possible that half these stories could be true. Anyone with common sense can see this.I did an internet search and found these reviews and miraculously they were all positive. very strange. I felt that I had to contribute my opinion.Jonathon Pederson
1,Seems like a rehash,"I read lots of books like this, and I found absolutely nothing new in here. In fact, it looked a bit familiar. With the checklists, the boxed tips, the statistics and the vignettes, it looked an awful lot to me like Be Alert, Be Aware, Have A Plan: The Complete Guide to Protecting Yourself, Your Home, Your Family, by Neal Rawls. Really, it looks like Patire got his whole idea on how to present his material from the Be Alert book (which, by the way, was a much much better book). I say don't bother."
2,MISLEADING,"After I was told about this book I decided to make the purchase. Not only was this book filled with common fodder, it is unfortunately also filled with fantasy stories. The common sense stuff was OK, but like I said it was common sense. Nothing new or groundbreaking info available. The author even uses the pages to promote his other business's. Very shameful and NOT what I purchased the book for.I would not recommend this book as a safety book, the title is misleading. It is more of a fictional autobiography with promotional aspects littered in with common safety tips.God Bless!God blesses those whose hearts are pure, for they will see God.--Matthew 5:8"
4,Great Overall Protection Manual,"This is a very comprehensive book on personal protection. It is far broader than a street self defense manual. It covers all kinds of self defense and safety issues.It is very broad in its scope. Here are a few of the areas it addresses: street self defense, fire safety, mobs, traveling in strange cities, online shopping, and much more. As you can see, it is far reaching.Prior to reading this, I never would have guessed that an author could cover such a broad range so well in such a relatively small book.I would recommend this book for anyone who would like to improve his/her overall personal and family safety. There are numerous tips for parents of small children that are excellent.You really can't go wrong with this book. It will stimulate lots of thought for most readers."
1,Worst Band Ever?,"1. Terri Nunn is a terrible singer.2. John Crawford is a terrible singer. Their groans and grunts at the conclusion of Sex (I'm A ...) is funny in an embarassing sort of way.3. John Crawford is a terrible songwriter.4. The only song on this release worth a second listen is The Metro. The rest is really, really bad.5. Berlin is shocking, in a emotionally stunted, junior high school sort of way"
1,Proof The 80's Were a Music Wasteland,"One of the worst bands of the 80's. This is proof you do not need talent to get a record deal, just a hot chick to put in your video. This band, like a hundred others, would not have had any hits except for MTV. Mindless pop/disco which was very popular in the 80's, just like Britney, Christina, and their ilk are today. Bad singing, bad songwriting, bad musicianship, overly produced."
3,idk,"My wife likes these guys, and this album particularly. I don't mind it. i preferred watching the singer than listening to the albums lol"
2,What has Italy come to? Giotto is rolling over in his grave,This music was recommended to me by a misguided Italian friend. It simply does not hold up in comparison to Justin Timberlake's work. (This is the standard by which I now judge all art). Take your chances with Fabrizio...If you dare!
3,A++++++++++++++++++++++,"this was ok for as long as it lasted, it really only took a couple months before it stopped working but it was a great buy"
5,Item is great,"Item is well worth the price. Haven't had it long, but I have put quite a bit of stuff on it already and it's working great. I agree with other reviews about the little clip ring, it breaks in no time."
4,Does the job.,This drive carries as much storage as it says and works as you'd expect it to. Just don't expect to carry it around on your key chain like you may with a similar product by another brand. I don't trust he little ring (shown in the picture) to not break.
5,always satisfied with Essentials series,"Essentials of MMPI-A Assessment is an extremely useful addition to this great series. Like with other Essentials titles I own, there is an easy-to-read format that lets me use it as a reference. This book is an excellent tool for scoring and interpreting the MMPI-A, and I definately would recommend it to my fellow clinicians."
4,MMPI-A,This book is great to have around for students just starting to learn about the MMPI-A. They break down the catgories and give sample reports to help clarify the fuzzy parts.
1,YOU HAVE TO WRITE YOUR OWN CODES???,"i bought thise game shark and used it right away. it goes to this code page, of course, and so i figured i'd turn on some codes. NOT SO EASY! as i just figured out, u have to write ur own code. so i did that but it still didn't work. i can't figure out how this thing works at all. i tried to get infinite rare candies, like it did in the example but i couldn't get it to work. this product is not worth buying. Even with the detailed instruction manuel it is still impossible to figure out how to get these codes to work! DONT'T BUY, get a gba or gbc game shark! they are great!"
1,It doesn't even boot the game !!!,"This device should be avoided at all costs, nothing works the way it should and the manual doesn't help you at all. Even the gameshark internet page has dissapeared !!! If you want to hack Pokemon games use the Gameshark Pro 3.0."
1,F-,I hate this gameshark. If u want a Celiby or mew it messes up your graphics and when you battle with it is just the pokemon you copieed like if I went over a beedrill to a mew in stats it would look like a mew but when you battle it will look like a BeedrillDO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,pokemon crystal game shark,I bought this for a color game boy for a 10 year old why do you have to edit the hexadecimal codes for it to work we have a playstion that used a gameshark cd that was much more better it allowed her to pick what codes and cheats she wanted and I though6t this would be the same but i was really disappointed with this I would not buy it again
4,It's fine,"I don't know what's with all the negative reviews. It works fine with my games. The only thing it misses is the code browser for PC. I even remember there was supposed to be a USB compatible package, but can't seem to find it. Back to this product, it is more stable for the Pokémon games, which is a plus."
1,gameshark no good,when i bought my game shark it was very confussing to use.on my cryistal version i had 235 and when i went to add the other pokemon i couldn't get i used the game shark while it was loading it said your file has been erased.i had to start all over there is still more pokemon i need but i will not dare touch THE G A M E S H A R K again!
2,NOTHING BUT A WORTHLESS PIECE OF SH*T,"Hi, I am Rob, I am a huge Pokemon fan. My data on my Pokemon gold version was recently deleted and it really pissed me off. My game shark stopped working after I have had it for about a month. Now I cant play it as easily. It also f**ked up my silver version, which I am planning to start over on my pokemon silver since my gold version is starting to have problems. Hopefully I'll find another cheat device that I can trust. F**K YOU GAMESHARK!"
5,"Elliot Moose, an endearing character","Elliot, the cutest little wide-eyed moose stuffed animal you could hope to meet, is so eager to get outside and enjoy spring that he attempts to fit through the mail slot in his front door and gets stuck. All of his friends come to help him out, but nothing seems to work. Will Elliot figure out how to work himself free? This is cute book for kids and anyone that enjoys kids books."
1,Another forgettable instrumentals cd from Instrumental Icons,"This goes to show that the best beats are on the streets [Bootlegged instrumentals mixtapes] and not in the stores. This cd is nothing more than another collection of seriously wack renditions of otherwise mostly hot beats. I'm starting to hope that these cd's go out of print very very soon. Cause let's face it, What rapper or dj in their right mind wanna use these beats on this cd when they can get the far superior original beats on bootlegged beats cd's?"

5,gotta love the classics,"just like in the old days, i had to blow into the game to get it to play the first time but thats to be expected. game play was excellent, it really shows you how far fighting games have come yet how great mk2 already was for its time and even now. if you want a challenge play this game and the other old mortal kombat games and not mash the buttons"
5,LOVE LOVE THIS COOK BOOK!,"I am a bit of a cook book collector and this one along with one other are used the most by far. The key is a good wok to accompany this cook book. What I love the most about this cook book is the recipes are always fantastic and SIMPLE! Meat off the wok is always the most tender (my favorite food comes from the wok and the grill) and this cook book never fails me. All the recipes are simple, mainly prep, and good. I have been making the same recipes out of the cook book for the past 8 years. That is long I have had it.If you want an excellent WOK to accompany your cook book, I might suggest thewokshop.com (the cast iron woks). I bought this wok on my honeymoon 8 years ago and that wok and this cook book are a perfect marriage! (o; Keeps the hubz happy."
4,Evil Cults & Groups Galore!,"Wonderfully put together, beautiful maps of the bad guyz' hideouts you can use for anything, the organizations and details on the NPC's can likewise be used with other side treks, etc. I personally look forward to using the Cormanthor Drow Elves and the Cult of the Dragon in my campaign."
5,Excellent photo essay of the desert war.,"David Fletcher, of Britain's Tank Museum, has written numerous books covering British tank development from the First World War through World War Two, rivaling Richard Hunnicutt's chronicle of American armor. However, Mr. Fletcher's series of books for the Tank Museum were largely text, with very few illustrative photos. With this new title, he makes up lost ground, with a very nice selection of large format photos of the desert war against Rommel. Most of the photos are fresh subjects. The reproduction is quite good, and the paper is glossy (though some snapshots of obscure subjects look like, well, snapshots). We can only hope he follows up with additional titles on the campaigns of 1939-40, and 1944-45."
3,Difficult read,"A book you know merits better understanding, if only it could be understood. Garner's language is very choppy and difficult to follow, but the catch-22 of the situation is that it must be in order for the story to come alive. After a few reads you become accustomed to the writing and can focus more on the thematic value."
3,Go hear the Originals,"As a Fan of Eric from the early days, this album was really unnecessary as I have almost all of the tracks on their original albums. However, it still is a good introduction to why Eric excited us in the 'olden days'. His playing with Mayall and Cream remains his best work. This generalisation is not totally true as shown by the 'Same Old Blues' track from the 'Behind the Sun' album which unfortunately not featured here, but 'CrossRoads' is still as magic as ever. I also love 'Outside Woman Blues' because it also shows how good Ginger Baker was on drums."
4,A well written book,"A well written book by a respected bottle shipwright. However as a collector of books on ships in bottles, although very good, this is far from the best. For real enthusiasts of building ships in bottles I would recommend a book called Ship Models in Glass which in my mind is the most authorative book ever written on the subject, a little pricey but well worth it."
3,Are you kidding,YOu people actually think this is a good show?... I will definitly say that it has entertainment value but for reasons other than good acting and plotlines... It is the worst and best show ever.
1,"""A plane crashed here...""","That was a classic moment, where Walker's Cherokee roots and well-tuned sense of taste came in handy. Yes, he actually tasted that a plane had crashed there. How, the hell, was that possible? Seriously. Only on Walker: Texas Ranger.This show was extremely cheesy. Now, don't get me wrong, Norris is tough; he can fight like no other. But all of that ""coolness"" goes away once he opens his mouth, and the camera focuses on him long enough for the viewer to see his mullet. Walker is too much of a nice guy. Everything he says is corny.The show's corniness transcends to a state of absolute hilarity in the long run. If anyone saw Conan O'Brien's ""walker texas ranger"" lever bit, it was by far the funniest thing I have ever seen on Conan. You can get to it by going to this URL:http://gorillamask.net/conanwalker.shtmlThis is too funny. You must see it."
5,awesome!,Chuck Norris at his finest (great martial arts technique). All these eopisodes are also great for young people to learn the values that make America great!
5,What are you talking about ?,"Look, while this show was not the best on TV, it was good. You have to give Chuck credit for doing something right. The show lasted more than six seasons. Isn't that saying something? Most TV shows don't even last half a season these days. And if you're wondering, ""J.J."", half of a season is (13) episodes. Chuck went over (100) episodes. I guess, it was a bad show, eh ""J.J.""? Now, I'm not slammin' you, by any means, but give the guy a break. Chuck did his best for almost eight years. And yes, alot of his fight scenes were actually not him. (Which would probably explain the ""famous roundhouse kick"" not seeming like smooth Chuck Norris style.) Sorry Chuck, but it was noticable a couple of times. Anyway, don' t you think that after 5 to 7 years, Mr. Norris earned the right not to do some of his fight scenes? Well, I hope they release the complete series. And for those ""J.J.'s"" out there, if it's really that bad for you, when you seen the DVD's on the shelf, keep walking..."
1,Obnoxious Series,I can't believe that anyone actually likes this show. It is the cheesiest and most ridiculous show that I have ever seen on TV. You would have to be a moron to buy this.PS: Chuck can't even do his essential roundhouse kick in the last season.
5,Best Crime Drama Of The 90's,"I love this show, there are very few crime drama's that make the grade, if you know what I mean. I have always liked Chuck Norris and his movies. I like the action and adventure of the show and the fight scenes and the storylines as well. I think Noble Willingham (C.D. Parker) makes the perfect bartender and Clarence Gilyard (Trivette) makes a very good sidekick and partner for Texas Ranger (Cordell Walker) Chuck Norris. You can't go wrong getting this DVD set because it's one of the best shows of the 90'S."
5,Truth in Justice,"The Walker DVD set is simply fantastic...Walker is truly the epitomy of what we strive ALL law enforcement to be these days. However, being realistic, that unfortunately isn't going to happen. Too many times law enforcement's hands are tied as to what they can do, or how far they can go. Wal;ker, however, doesn't allow the victim to suffer, and will ""go to the ends of the earth"" for the victim or victim's rights, as they are priority to him and his staff...The relationship he has with Alex Cahill says it all....AAAA Rating....Sam Allen"
5,A GREAT COP SHOW,"It was about time that WALKER, TEXAS RANGER finally came out on DVD. It is one of the best cop shows I have ever seen. I like it where WALKER and his team kicks the bad guys butts and this show is better than some of the other ""cop"" shows that are still on the air. This show is also more cleaner too. What I mean by that is is that the show uses very little foul language and has very little, close to no sexuality."
4,Can't Wait,"Walker one of the longest running fiction oriented police drama shows great show this season was the last we Have Walker, Trivette, Sydney, Gage, and ofcourse Alex Cahill-Walker. Shame they won't release the whole. Series but something is better than nothing."
4,why not?????,Why didn't Phil Spector release his recordings on Stereo? the Cd re-issues? They sure must sound far better.
2,Only two good songs,"The only songs I can stand listening to on this album are Rooney's amazing ""Death on Two Legs"" and Sum 41's surprisingly good ""Killer Queen.""Joss Stone's ""Under Pressure"" makes me sick."
4,Pretty decent cover record. I would give 5 stars if no Constantine.,"Constantine's version of Bohemian Rhapsody is way too ""paint-by-numbers"" and dare I say weaker than the original. Just like most of the American Idol covers on TV. The Flaming Lips version is not for the faint of heart. The track could be on any of their albums from the mid-eighties to 1995. It's the Lips doing what they always do.Joss Stone's cover of Under Pressure on one hand sounds great. On the other hand, the problem in my opinion is her vocals. She doesn't sing the lyrics with the urgency that Freddie did. She glosses right over the lyrics."
3,Good Tribute,"I really liked Breaking Benjamin and Shinedown's Tie Your Mother Down. What rockin tracks! Love them. Those are the best tracks on the album. I don't know who Constatnine(no last name) is, but he is no Freddie Mercury. It seemed like he was trying to copy Freddie note for note and absolutely does a disservice to Freddy. The Flaming Lips interpretation of BoRap is much more fun and original. Gavin Degraw's voice is not edgy enough to sing the song he did and I love Gavin."
1,I can't imagine ever wanting to hear this...,"With exception of the Flaming Lips and Josh Homme, there is no real talent on this. Once again, we have the debate of singers vs. songwriters. Anyone can hold a note with enough practice folks (most not very well). Talent, in music, requires some ability to write your own songs and not let it be manipulated. If you can't write a song or play an instrument, than you are not a musician. You are simply a performer, and performers can be anywhere and everywhere, including on top of a shoebox on the corner. American Idol is not talent; it is a circus side show, and no character from that program has any business covering Queen. I say character because the program is fabricated. This does not even deserve a star; really no band should cover Queen, not even the remaining members with Paul Rodgers."
3,"Contantine sucks, Flips RULE!","Okay, first I have this to say. Constatine's cover of Bohemian Rhapsody sounds like a karaoke version. It's weak. And what's the point of putting a cover on an album if it's trying to mimick the original. Contantine is not an true artist, if he was he would try to find a new way to intrepetate the song. I think the Lips version was more in the spirit of Queen, You can tell they had fun recording it, unlike Costantine's where everyone sounds bored. And come on, the Lips at least played some instruments on it. Even Freddy played piano. What does Constantine do. NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Queen Has a New Fan,"I was never a Queen fan (although I'm old enough to have been one). I just never liked Rock. I admit I bought this CD because of Constantine Maroulis, and I am now becoming a fan of Queen. Constantine's version is so close to the original...I really think Freddie would be happy with it. The Flaming Lips version, on the other hand, is uneven and pitchy in spots - my least favorite cut. Also loved Crazy Little Thing Called Love by Josh Kelley and Killer Queen with Sum 41. With one or two exceptions - a super Tribute!"
1,Going slightly mad....,"Buy this disc if you want to feel like someone stole your favorite toy, tagged it with profane sharpie writing, and then tried to sell it back to you as something new;Gavin's version of we are the champions made me feel like stabbing myself in the eye with my pen;Eleven's version of stone cold crazy made me feel like i was having a seriously horrible acid trip;and breaking benjamin's version of who wants to live forever sounded like i had the vocals slowed down but the music was sped up;good rock song + crappy artists = cringe worthy remakes that never should have been released;this album is only getting 1 star because i dont think it will let me give it 0 and Constantines version of bohemian rhapsody is awesome! it the only song worth listening and you can probably download it some where or get it from your dumb friend who bought the disc and then relized it what a piece of crap..."
4,Great for any Queen fan...,"or not...If you are anxious to hear the same arrangements of your favorite songs, don't look here.But don't stop reading yet..It's a fun CD to hear others takes on the classics of Freddie & the rest of Queen. But what makes the CD shine, that special spark is Constantine's performance of BR. He builds a shrine for Freddie, take it to a different level & leaves the listener eager for more.Good CD if you aren't expecting too much of the Orignial Queen sound.The only track that's worth the use of my skip song button is ""Bicycle Race."""
1,Not recommended,"The title gives the impression that the book contains specifics of Costa Rican Spanish, but this is not the case. Spain was mentioned a couple of times, but I could find nothing about Costa Rican Spanish. Since that was what I was interested in, it was of no use to me. Far better is the SmallPlanet book on Costa Rican Spanish. It is very complete, giving the idiosyncracies of that country's Spanish usage, and is very well-organized into different situational contexts."
2,vague and climate-specific,"Allow me to be blunt. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.Pat Lanza gardens in upstate New York. If you don't live in a similar climate, half the book (plant recommendations) isn't going to apply to you. If you want info on in situ composting (which is what she does-- it's not her own original idea, and it's not her grandmother's either), look for books by Ruth Stout (whose books on this topic have been in print since the 1950s) or pursue info on the InterBay Mulch method from Seattle.There are no pictures of her garden in this book, despite the fact that she spends tons of time describing what her gardens are like and how she created them. I can't remember gaining any really helpful info on pests, composting decomposition, small garden planning, or landscaping techniques, either.Doesn't sound very helpful, does it?"
1,"Great flick, ridiculous price","""Lifeguard"" is a simple, honest story about a man who is wrestling with that classic conundrum: love or money?But...$109.95 for the DVD? Nope. Not going to happen. This DVD might sell at $19.95 or less, but at five times that price? I'm guessing there's plenty in stock...."
2,"Thin, predictable, not even a good waste of time","This movie is part of the Joan Collins series. Sadly it is the opposite of the glamorous image that she portrays. I have yet to see a morepredictable or boring film. Anne Archer: Where is she? I see a young teen sexy bikini girl who gets hot for a lifeguard, must have him or at least make love. I see a classmate trying to lure a lifeguard to sell Jaguars and make money. I see a rookie lifeguard trying to fit in withElliott. I see and feel boredom all the way through. I have a good copy that will go for $2.00 plus postage. Why? Ho Hum. Some like to see lifeguards rescue stranded people and enjoy photos of sandy beaches, with a few bikinis thrown in. I see a boring film that is thin. Elliott might have made this for some money. But this is not a movie that he would list on his dossier. Read a book or watch TV. You will enjoy either more."
4,Theme Song Information,"The original theme song for this movie is ""Time and Tide"" it was written and performed by Paul Williams and is available on one of his CD collections.I believe that the theme song was changed in 1992 when the movie was re-released as a TV movie.I don't know why they changed the song, I still remember some of the words and I haven't seen the movie since 1976!!!What's that old saying????? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.Hope that helps,ajmcgill"
5,I Love Sam Elliott,"I was introduced to Sam Elliott in this movie (I was a high school sophomore then)and have been a FAN ever since. I love his voice and he is just plain sexy! I never pass up a Sam Elliott movie, especially this one!"
3,Quaint quotations,"I found this book in the library, and it's filled with really interesting quotes; some are repeated, though. I have a project that requires many different quotations, and this book met the needs I had. I wouldn't recommend it for casual browsing, though -- at about 350 pages, it's not the most approachable of books. That's not to say that it's incomprehensible (because you can sit down and read from it, if you want), just that I don't think it is the wisest choice for that purpose."
2,Eric needs more!!,"First of all, I am huge Eric Matthews fan, but there only two good songs on this ep- it's not really an full album. I think his first album was ground breaking, not to mention, consistent. On this ep, most of the songs song like outtakes and secondary compositions compared to his earlier work. Eric's voice has too many effects on it and the guitar solos date the songs a bit. Having said that- Cardinal was phenomenal! It seems, both, Richard and Eric have struggled to capture the magic of that album. These guys, together, was a Godsend! The complimented each other so well. Crap, I'm going to call Bob Fay, Doyle, get some beer and see if we can get the band together!"
3,Not his best,"It took him 7 years to release this ""album"" of 7 songs. None of them have real strong hooks and they seem almost like leftovers from his last album.I hope it doesn't take him this long for the next album, becasue the long wait wasn't worth the mediocrity of most of this album."
1,"Tivo is great, this UNIT is not","I've had this unit about a year and have been having the same issues with ""remote lagtime"" and loud dvd tray...but I was put off so many times by Humax support that now I'm out of warranty. I too wonder if it is the box or the remote, as now the picture quality has been getting worse and worse. At the highest image settings, shows are recorded WAY too dark. : (Checked all connections...tv...cable...etc. Even compared a VCR taped version of the same exact show tivoed in the other room...the tivoed one was dark and murky. Live tv is fine...it seems to be the way the Humax records now.It's a shame, because having a integrated DVD recorder is a great idea...one I was willing to pay $300+ for and now regret."
1,Horrible remote problems,"This unit worked fine for about a month and then suddenly the remote became extremely sluggish. We now have to press any button 3 to 5 times before it will register. After trying all the troubleshooting tips and researching the problem online, we discovered from other users that this problem was not uncommon."
2,Buyer Beware: Humax lowers your picture quality,"What a wonderful idea this is - DVD recorder with TiVo. Unfortunately, there are a few things they don't tell you. If you have an older television, you may not have the necessary inputs/outputs to make the unit and/or all of the features work. My set was nine years old - I ended up buying a new one.However, the most upsetting part of this experience was the terrible graininess that showed up in the picture (on my new set!). I thought I had hooked the cables up incorrectly. I purchased the recommeded component cables for the ""best video picture"" and it was still dreadful. After talking to several technicians, I spoke with a supervisor who confirmed that, if you do not have a cable box, the unit significantly decreases the quality of the picture. The bigger your set, the more noticeable this change in quality is. I have a 27"" which they characterized as ""big"".I returned the unit. Bless Sam's Club and their ""satisfaction guaranteed"" return policy!"
2,take your chances,"This is an upgrade to my Tivo series 2 DVR (which I LOVED). Just got it and seems to be okay but it is extremely noisy!!! I can hear it buzzing over my TV 10 feet away! The Tivo site says that noise is normal and depending on the machine it can be very loud. I checked Tivo community sites and others have had the same problem. If I have to send this back to the manufacturer over an issue that Tivo considers ""normal"" I'll give this zero stars. Way too much money ($600) for that cheesy, noisy fan!!"
4,Not compatible with DirecTV D10 satellite receiver.,"DirecTV says the only stand-alone satellite receiver it's distributing at this time is the DirecTV (no manufacturer's name) D10-300. The Humax DRT800 doesn't ""know"" the IR codes for the D10-300, and no other control link is available, so the Humax can't change its channels. That makes the Humax unusable for DirecTV TiVo prgramming-unless you find some other (older model) DirecTV receiver to hook it up to.I was also disappointed to find that the Humax can't burn programs from dual-tuner Series 2 TiVo units on the same network. Format incompatibility."
1,Faulty remote,"Before you buy this, google for ""tivo humax sluggish remote"". As of February 06, you'll see rumblings of a class action lawsuit about a remote control problem that has not been addressed by Tivo or Humax."
2,JUnk,"I would have given it a 1 star, but it did work, until now. The unit will not record on to DVD-RW now, it won't even start the process. I'm sure I've had the unit to long to get a replacement for it, but it's been a POS lately. Do not buy this."
2,Humax vs Two separates,"Interesting reading the reviews so far on this ""potential"" all in one device. I will say that I don't own the new Humax and here's why. I currently have a Panasonic DMR E100H 160 PVR/DVR and TIVO. The Panasonic works great for the recording of programs/home video etc. onto DVDs. The main reason I would not buy the Humax all in one unit is that it does not do any type of program editing which is very flexible on the Panasonic unit.If you really want to burn a DVD program it is great to edit it before hand to eliminate commercials and start and finish positions to end up with a clean program for future viewing.So I think I will wait until this segement of the market figures this out with the next generation of products. Until then, it's a separate TIVO and DVR burner for me."
4,humax 80 hour dvd recorder,I had to return item as it was damaged on arrival and did not order a new one through Amazon as I did not have faith in in whatever vendor you were using for this product that I would receive a good product next time either. Whoever is packaging this product should use better cartons for shipping as it is not a cheap product.Your customer service is the best I have EVER seen !!!! The damage product was picked up by UPS the next day. All I had to do was notify you via email. I will definitely use Amazon in the future as I can buy with confidence that you take care of things. I just didn't like what this vendor did as it looked like I got a used product.
1,You'll be lucky to get a year out of this machine,"Well after a year of transfering lots of home video VHS onto the hard drive of this machine, the hard drive has crashed and all of my video files and about 100 hours iof work are gone. The only thing Humax will do is offer a replacement machine that is refurbished for a fee.. This unit is total crap. DO NOT BUY"
1,"Terrible, just awful on my fourth replacemenet.",What a mistake! nothing but trouble. DO NOT BUY< DO NOT BUY it is a POS.
3,Nice... but not exactly what I expected.,"I was VERY sad (read upset) to discover that it is not possible to copy programs from regular Series 2 TiVos to the DRT800 and then save them to a DVD due to format differences. This was the only reason I purchased a third TiVo (Humax) system.Also, direct customer service from both Humax and TiVo are weak as they bury their direct email addresses as to deter you from contacting them directly and calling the support number means a long wait on hold. However, they both have a lot of good information online, but it is time consuming to weed through the wealth of information. TiVo should be lucky that its followers have established their own online TiVo Community to help each other out; few businesses have the benefit of letting someone oversee their support for free."
3,Similar image quality/hard-drive issues,Just wanted to second the comments made concerning the quality of the image as well as the machine malfunctioning. We purchased the TIVO DRT800 at the beginning of January and immediately noticed picture quality issues. Sometime in early February the machine started to skip/generally malfunction and by mid-February just plain didn't work. As others mentioned after 2 hours on the phone with Humax we were forced to put a $500 deposit down to receive a new machine until we shipped ours back. We returned the broken one in the last couple days and are hoping that the deposit is refunded without issue or more time spent on the phone with Humax.Keeping our fingers crossed that machine #2 does not malfunction as well!!
5,I Didn't Want to Stop,"Hollace Weiner's writing kept me enthralled. This book is the rare combination of careful and accurate research while the presentation is that of an enticing historical novel. It's loaded with all the goods - mystery, politics, romance and more, but all the accounts are true. I couldn't put this book down as every chapter had a fresh and intriguing draw. The facts themselves are fascinating. Written in Ms. Weiner's engaging style, this book is a big winner."
4,Very well done album by this band!,"Big Dume's album is so very well done. Brandon Jenner and his band have some dynamic rock songs here. Mexico is very catchy and the other songs are melodic and well structured. Brandon's lyrics are very deep on most cuts, full of emotional and spiritual themes. There are influences of Santana and some '70s rock felt within the songs, but very much modern. And Brandon is a good singer over these songs. Brandon may have been on the short-lived The Princes of Malibu, but while that show will be forgotten, this album will be well remembered for its strong music. One of the surprise albums I've listened to this year. This band needs to be promoted more!"
2,Pedigree Doesn't Mean Talent !,"Though the mix is eclectic, the lyric's show little imagination. The harmonies are repetitive and completely without anything new or exciting. This would NEVER have been released by any reputable recording company if not for their connections. Another example of Show Biz nepotism at its worst. DON'T WASTE YOUR CASH !"
4,A grown-ups' collie story,"""Lassie Come Home"" is for kids; ""Barking Her Way to the Top"" is a grown-ups' collie story. Dog lovers, convinced their dogs are smarter than we give them credit for, can't help but laugh at the heroine Kukushka's treatment of her ""dumb animal."" Howard Rowland really got the collie personality down, pant. I mean, ""pat."" Since it's written by someone familiar with the excesses and clever hindsight government bureaucracies serve up, this book will also find fans among bureaucratic employees who think there might be a better way around all the red tape of their jobs."
4,"""Credible Journey""",Mr. Rowland makes this journey of an intelligent dog working her way to the top of a prestigious government language school in the Monterey area surprisingly credible. Read it and enjoy it. I did.
4,"""Credible Journey""","Mr. Rowland makes this journey of an intelligent dog working her way to the top of a prestigious government language school in Monterey, CA surprisingly credible. Read it and enjoy it. I did."
2,not particularly useful,"I bought this book specifically looking for a baby sling. Well, there IS a sling pattern, but it's really no good.All the other projects are pretty dated in fashion, and teh baby clothes don't seem like they would be easy to put on a baby! The best part was the baby shower decorations, very cute, and it told how to make prefold diapers, which was nice. (although it's not that hard to figure out!)I would buy an inexpensive pattern from the fabric store rather than this book."
4,"Great ideas, hard to use some patterns","I loved this book -- an absolute five stars...until I tried to use the patterns. They seem to be laid out at random over four large tissue sheets. Some pattern pieces aren't labeled as to which project they belong to. There's no index to the pattern pages to tell you where to find the pieces of the pattern you want, and the pieces for a single project could appear on several different pages. To cram more in on one sheet, pattern sections sometimes overlap. The overalls are one of the worst pattern examples. A single pattern piece to be cut on a fold shows cut lines for short and long versions, front and back, and four sizes. That's 16 different pattern pieces. The intersecting and poorly labeled cut lines make it impossible to find the outlines for the version you need. Or maybe next to impossible. I haven't given up yet. But for the simpler projects, patterns are clearer, and the ideas in the book really are great."
2,Great ideas but mediocre intructions,"I do not recommend this book if are a beginner; the instructions are very vague and if you're just starting out it will be confusing.I'm an intermediate/advanced sewer and it took me a long time to figure out the instructions for the projects I chose to make.great ideas but incredibly poor instructions,"
5,Great shape,I thought they sent me a new book. It was used but it was in great shape. Shipped faster then expected too
1,American style writting.,"An 800 pages book.you only need about 40 pages to write all the real surveying stuffall the rest is useless, wastefull, wording intended to make the bookFAT and sell it. by giving it the impression of being full of content.it is a charlatan's trash."
5,An Excellent Text for Construction Students,I have used this text to teach surveying to Construction Management students who need to only know the basics of construction surveying and layout on the jobsite. I have found this book to be easy for construction students to use and take with them to industry. I look forward to the next edition.
4,Newcomers,"I have been working in the field as a chief engineer for 5 years, and have read this book from cover to cover. I would advise any new layout man/woman who plans on starting a career in the field to obtain a copy, and by all means issue these to your rodmen. You will find a drastic improvement on work skills and habbits, and less rework. C.J. Finn"
3,Basic construction surveying examples,"The book has a lot of basic info and formulas and gives examples of field techniques, but unfortunately like most texts I've seen, it doesn't go into enough depth. I was looking for detailed explanations on slope staking but this has only 6 pages on the subject and the only method shown is the use of tape and hand level. No examples of how a total station or GPS can be used to slope stake are given, and no mention of how the stakes themselves should be marked is included.Probably an ok text for the beginner but it lacks depth."
5,Cedarific is terrific,This cat litter is great. It has good odor control and best of all it light- no heavy bags or cat boxes to carry. It cleans up well. I am unablle to buy it in a store near me any longer but myself and my cats like it so much I'm ordering it online.
1,Smelly & tracking,"I purchased this for my new kitty after reading such fantastic reviews. Unfortunately, I couldn't bear the awful smell only after a day of using this litter. My cat is medium-haired & the litter was on his paws, coat, and everywhere in the house. Now I have no idea what I'm going to do with a big bag of cedar chips..."
5,kitty litter,this is the best. light weight. smells great. BUT so hard to find. thanks for haveing it availabe for my cats.
2,just good ol' saw dust,"the first time I purchased this product I was impressed. My cat is allergic to pine and and several other products. She was fine with the Cedar and it really masked the smells. I was happy to walk into my one bedroom apt and smell cedar vs. cat urine.Unfortunately, this last bag was a different product all together. It was just plain old saw dust. It is different in color and there is no cedar smell. So now I come home to the smell of saw dust and urine.I have used a green tea cat litter in the past which was great but very pricey. I may bite the bullet and go back to that.Bummer. Consistency is tops in my book - with any product."
5,My odor control weapon.,"Even though this is not a clumping litter, it's become a favorite in my litter setup. I use theLitter Robot LRII Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Beige, which gets rid of the clumps and puts them in a storage drawer in the base. Between the device's efficient use of litter, and the fact that it's designed to have clumps stored so I can go days between bag changes, it can develop some smells.Adding a cup of Cederific won't interfere with how well the 'Bot works, and takes care of ANY odor problems, even the stinky issues we got rehabilitating a starved kitten.Better than baking soda! And that's saying a lot."
4,Good product,"This is a great product. It is much better to use since you don't end up with the small ""gravel"", like other products, on floors."
1,CATS MAY DEVELOP AN ALLERGIC REACTION,"I decided to give this litter a try based on the positive reviews on Amazon. One of my cats developed an ALLERGIC reaction to this & it cost me several very expensive trips to the vet's office.Not all cats are allergic to this litter initally, but they may develop allergies over time. In any case it's not worth the risk.My vet recommended that I switch my cat off this litter immediately!"
1,strong ammonia odor after just one day,Allpine Pine is a much better choice. Cedarific has a strong ammonia odor after just one day after changing my cat box. Allpine pine lasts much longer. Will never buy this produce again.
5,HAPPY ME,"I LOVE THIS LITTER BECAUSE IT IS FLUSHABLE. ALSO, BUYING ONLINE IS CHEAPER THAN GOING TO NEIGHBORHOOD STORE TO PURCHASE."
1,Cedarific July 09,Excellent product; except for shipping charges which double the price of the product and has prompted me to seek a locally-available option.
4,Good but not great cat litter,"I've used this stuff for a couple of years now: I'm pretty satisfied with it. It's lightweight, compostable and inexpensive. Yes, it does track in the house, but it vacuums up right along with my regular cleaning. Yes, it does have an odor, but it's cedar, it could be a lot worse. It covers up the fecal and urinary odors so I'm not complaining. $[...] bucks is about average for the 50-liter size (25 lbs): look around the internet and you can find retailers who won't charge shipping."
4,Floral Applique,"The service was prompt and very efficient. Took about a week to get to Australia.The photographs in the book are beautiful, but I was very disappointed that there were no patterns for the featured quilts. I expected there would be patterns for at least some of them, especially the out of print ones."
1,OUTDATED HOGWASH,"I can't believe this ridiculous book is even still in circulation. People need to wake up and realize that generation after generation, lots of people(particularly herd-minded Americans) have done irreparable psychological damage to their precious infant sons by having this torturous, ritual abuse performed on them. There is absolutely NO reason to circumcise; leave your boys intact with the greatest, funnest body part that God Himself put there for a reason!"
1,Useful background,"This extraordinary book is a landmark in the history of this extraordinary operation. Remondino repeats every myth he has ever heard in its favour and makes up one of his own that is still circulating. It is Remondino who is single-handedly responsible for the claim that ""humans used to need the foreskin when they ran naked through the brambles, but now it is superfluous"". Remondino's version is so orotund that you will find yourself consulting a dictionary. (Who knew that an aegis is a shield?) It takes over a page and includes references to the fall of the Roman Empire, Belshazzar's feast and the ""jolly British Boniface [innkeeper]"".Buy a copy if you are a bibliophile, a student of 19th century American English uninfluenced by the colloquialism of Mark Twain, or a medical historian. For factual information about circumcision, it's almost as unreliable as the works of Schoen, Weiss or Morris, but at least it has the excuse of age."
5,Hallmark Ornament,"I was really pleased with the ornament. It wis cute. I received it in the time promised, and the condition was as described. Thank you."
4,"A nice compilation, mostly mixes of stuff you probably have","While not as great as other reviews rave, it's a solid ""B"" and better than Plastic #2. it starts off with a good, not great mix of Sarah McLaughlin's ""I Love You"", not as good as delerium's version on a previous comp. Then you get the butchered radio edit of the fantastic ""Xpander"" track by Sasha- almost all other tracks on this disc are 8-9 minutes, yet they include the 3:40 version on this comp- pitiful. Things start kicking up with the Delerium and Hybrod mixes, and BT's other mix is quality as well. The disc rounds out with a lesser but still decent CB track ""Under the Influence"", and a somewhat out of place but what the heck Beth Orton. Not great, but still recommended as a pickup for those who want a bit of mainstream common familiarity with their electronic music."
4,Reasonably Gentle Introduction to Celestial Mechanics,"I liked this book -- particularly the first half. In the first half, the author makes a very accessible presentation of Kepler's laws. The line of reasoning is clear and quite self-contained. This really is the first presentation of Kepler's calculations that I have seen that is accessible for the scientifically-inclined layman. The author also does a nice job with Newton's work (some knowledge of calculus concepts would help here). The later half of the book tries to present perturbation theory. While interesting, the arguments are less rigorous and more conceptual. The author also takes a very brief look at Earth satellites (very new at the time of publication - 1959) and Einstein's work (very cursory).The book does require that the reader have a working knowledge of algebra. A little high school physics would also help. Some calculus background would help when going through the material in the appendix."
4,DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER,"Frankly, Im not the biggest DiCaprio fan, but i really liked him in this, he was very believable as a white Rhodisian, though his accent goes in and out, sometimes it is spot on and other times it is...well..not..The movie has a brisk pace and it very violent, but it always felt real and you really want the characters to succeed. The film has an authentic feel, I suppose from the fact it was accually filmed in Africa. If this movie does not have you rethinking your diamond purchase, you need to check your ekg, you may be missing your heart. Highly recommended."
1,Violent & Boaring Movie,"Gosh how I hated this movie. The biggest problem is that you just don't care what happens to any character in the movie. So what you have left is HD blood and gore. My advice, rent the movie if you must and if you still want to watch it over-and-over, then buy it."
3,Get the HD DVD version,"The HD DVD version is the first and only title on either format to offer exclusive online content, as well as picture in picture. Blu-ray can't do any of that, in fact all existing players are already obsolete and will never have those features. If you want Blu-ray's advanced features, you'll have to buy another player when they come out late this year. Those are the facts ma'am, not FUD.And to the poster below: Warner makes the HD DVD VC-1 encode first, then ports that to Blu-ray. So much for your superior video and audio argument. BD just gets a copy of the HD DVD version, which is why both will look virtually identical."
1,BUY THE BLU-RAY HD VERSION,"Blood Diamond is an excellent movie, and would give the Movie itself 41/2 stars.HD-DVD is a dying format that only a FEW movie studios support.Buy the HD format of the now and future BLU-RAY HD for superior picture and sound."
5,Great movie on the BEST HD format BLU-RAY,"Blood Diamond was one of the better films of 2006. Dicaprio in a Oscar nominated performance is outstanding, and so are Hounsou and Connelly. Director Zwick hits the mark on this fine effort.Don't pay attention to the above hd-dvd Fanboi-BLU-RAY is the finest HD Disc format with the best picture and sound and that is what counts.Buy Blood Diamond on BLU-RAY, you will not be disappointed."
2,No More,"The case that the blu-rary movie came in was horrible. No more ordering from these guys. It is ashame that you spend your money only to get something that your're not happy with. I repeat, the case that the movie came in was horrible."
3,Enough !,"I really like this movie, it's one of the few I've enjoyed enough to consider watching more than once.. BUT the movie also tries to hammer home african unrest and turmoil, child soldiers, enormous refuge camps, ""conflict"" diamonds, mindless violence, mercenary military actions based solely on profit and monetary gain, etc. until it becomes annoyingly heavy handed... nearly to the point of interfering with the movie itself... I watch movies to distract myself from real life, not to be scolded for some of horrible and inhumane things that happen in this world..The three stars I gave this move would be closer to five if not for the guilt trip that results from watching it."
3,Will keep your interest.,"This is a good movie. It keeps your interest, and moves quickly. DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly worked well together too. And frankly I've never thought much of DiCaprio. But credit goes where it's due. A real plus for the film is the story line, and its relevance, and the fact there's no blatant sex displayed. The film itself though, as another reviewer put it, was a little too slick; too many things just worked right, with an overworked cliche or two, i.e. ""I like to get kissed before I get screwed"", uttered by DiCaprio toward Connellys attempt to pry information. I don't know that I'd sit through it again though, but perhaps."
5,compare to other so-so movies still got 4-star ratings,"this movie deserves 5 stars, even the ending sucks big time. the whole story is very intense and thrilling, it kept the audience sitting tight in their seats, not too many people left for the restrooms in the middle. decaprio did a great performance from a soldier of fortune to a born-again humanist who sacrificed himself for nothing. i am very glad that he finally looked pretty mature and indeed with genuine star quality. he should do more like this character instead of playing the image of a playboy. great performance of the other supporting actors too. the stunt, the fighting and massacre scenes were done great. only the editing needs to be more generous in cutting, not much but definitely needed."
4,Too Real,The truth of this movie scared me. Good movie with a lot of action. Kept me on the edge of my seat but it was too bloody for me at times.
5,Finally...DiCaprio lives up to his billing.,"This is an awesome movie with very strong performances from DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou.Having lived in West Africa from 1993-1998...this film acuratly portrays the diamond trades and brings home many real situations, dreams and nightmares.The viewer may see this film as a good and intense Drama which serves as a vehichle for DiCaprio and Hounsou...but in fact its a very bright and realistic view of the ""haves and the have-nots....and the want-to-be's""... in Africa."
4,good movie,"besides the superb quality of Blu Ray the film itself is worth the buy alone.good actors, beatiful pictures and of course a meaningful story about the conflictsthat sorounding Diamonds and other resources that cost human lifes, sad thing.as for the extras Nas Musicvideo included but not 1080pand actor and director sugesstions mostly in 1080pTIA :)"
5,Engrossing Movie,"I absolutely love this movie and it battles a topic that is not talked about much, and that is the diamond trade in Africa where people get killed and maimed over these diamonds (hence the term blood diamond). This movie is fairly accurate in its portrayl of Africa and it will bring you to tears. It's an emotionally moving film that everyone must see. It is a nice added addition to any DVD collection."
5,Blood Diamond,"I really enjoyed this action adventure and this story which exposes the dismembering and deaths that are a result of the diamond business. Wonderful performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and his cast. Very graphic and violent film that needs public attention. Once again a fully automatic gun only shoots for two seconds not 30 or more. Just an area that Hollywood needs to clean up to make the film more realistic like Act Of Valor!! Yes, I really enjoyed it and watched it again on Amazon Instant video as a gift of buying the DVD which was one great picture quality of my Vizio TV!!! through Wi Fi.I highly recommend it to mature audiences."
3,Way too much graphic violence shown,"This was a good movie, however I personally found all the graphic violenceto be over the top and definitely excessive. The story itself was goodand interesting, acting wonderful. Think about the lives that are beingdestroyed when you need that ""Bling""."
4,From Growing Pains to this...,"Man how DiCaprio has grown...from the little skinny no-body on Growing Pains, to the muscular heart throb on Blood Diamond, among other movies... Both Dicaprio and Hounsou seek the same diamond, but for different reasons. Dicaprio wants to get paid and Hounsou wants his son back. It's very intreguing and moving, two human stories with an outcome that will have tremendous impact on our lives today. Lies, denial, and bloodshed, for what...a rare pink diamond that is worth far less than any human life..."
5,I loved it,This movie is one of the best.. I think it was very well done and the actings are so great.. I saw the movie in theater and fell in love with the movie ;)also the original score of this movie is amazing as well..
5,A Must See!,"This movie is emotional, compelling, and informative. Everybody needs to see this movie!"
3,Very watchable,"I've always been a fan of director Edward Zwick. Legends of the Fall, Glory, About Last Night and The Last Samurai are all very watchable. Blood Diamond is no different. DiCaprio is solid as ever but the films theme is slightly muddled. It's a little bit like Indiana Jones meets City of God. An odd comibination to be sure. It works well at times, but at others it's hard to tell whether its a light-hearted romp or a political piece of film-making. I liked it though, and it's deinitely worth a look as it's fairly unique."
2,Got Boringly Familiar,"Yes, there is action. Yes, there is decent acting. But ultimately, it becomes another preachy, and bogged down film."
2,Ok but not quite satisfying,"In spite of fine performances, this film (like Last Samurai) is just too slick and leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. It's certainly compelling with good cinematography. I admit to having some difficulty with DiCaprio--I can always see him acting. Loved him in The Departed but here, as in The Aviator and Gangs of New York, I just couldn't get into his character and kept watching him perform. The film also was just a bit too sensational."
3,NOT BAD ACTION MOVIE BUT..........,"OK movie loses credibility by having every african character speak english and having hundreds of bullets evading the heroes, even when everbody else around them gets hit.Hard to believe Oscar voters nominated DeCaprio in this film over his performance on ""The Departed"". Doesn't make much sense that him and Hounsou would both get nominated here when they spend 90% of the movie screaming at each other's faces from exactly one inch apart.Not the worst action movie but unfortunately, by having watched it the very next day after ""Last king of Scotland"", it's Hollywood nature felt all the more obvious to me."
2,Disappointing!,"The great press touting ""Blood Diamond"" led me to expect a film with the depth of insight into the politics and social consequences of the diamond trade that I found when watching ""Hotel Rwanda."" The latter was chilling in its realism of the international politics connected with this genocide and excellent in portrayal of its characters.Not so with ""Blood Diamond."" For me, nothing in ""Blood Diamond"" redeems the film's failure to depthfully unmask the price paid by everyday African workers for a commodity that we so often use to symbolize the ""good life"".It is a film heavy on bloodshed, threats to survival and brutality. Characterizations are lightweight. The African father, in particular, should have been portrayed with a great deal more depth. His character was so obscure and marginalized that there was no preparation for his actions at the film's end.In short, on all counts -- I was deeply disappointed. The best I can say of it is that there is plenty of action."
2,"Leonadro di Caprio was in over his head with this movie, hey! Hey! HEY!!!","This movie was spoiled halfway through by the muddled accent that Leonardo di Caprio tries to pass off as Southern-African, not to mention the consistency with which he ends almost every line in the movie with the word, ""Hey"" which gets really annoying after the first 20 times. Another negative factor that managed to spoil this film is Hollywood's obsessive usage of pyrotechnics that surpass anything that an IQ over 30 might mistake for a realistic effect. Worse movies have been made but not one starring Leonadro di Caprio."
3,HAHAHA!!! THIS MOVIE IS SOO FUNNY!!!!!,"Im not saying that this movie is comedy, but Djimon Hounsou's acting JUST MADE ME LAUGHT UNTIL MY STOMACH HURTS. I mean... I know that his character is suffering because of his family but there are like three scenes that he COMPLETELY OVER-ACTED the whole situation about his family!(specially in the final fight scene). AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!Another funny stuffs are the gore that is kind of fake, DiCaprios's dialoge sometime is cheesy, Connelly wasn't acting! she was modeling and the captions that even describes the music that will play on the movie!!The movie has a lot of action scenes but this is more like drama, and the action is choreographied as war! so don't think that the action is this movie is the same as Last Samurai by the same director.I gave it 3 stars because all of that, but the movie is still entertaining and easy to understand.adios and have fun with this movie."
5,"Very, Very, Very Good Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This was a very good movie. The story is great. It involves a money thirsty mercenary who is trying to find his major score. He is trying to find money when he hears of huge diamond being mined by the slaves mining blood diamonds. He offers the guy who mined the diamond a way to find his family. In the process, though, he decides to develop a conscious and turns into a likeable character. He ends up helping people because of their family bonds and does the right thing. In the end he dies, but does so in a heroic way."
4,good movie not great,"this movie is a bit over the top and Leo being a soilder just dose not work for me. Nevertheless it is good movie and it is worst 15 dollars, but nothing more. Leo can play all roles, but i just can not picture him in this one to date."
4,Blood Money,The Actor's from two different lives coming together under adverse conditions and working together to achieve their own goals.
3,Not very entertaining though enlightening...,"This movie was very well put together for what it is. It is almost a docudrama about present day Africa, exploitation of Africans by each other as much as anyone, and the diamond trade.I have two problems with the movie. First, it was not entertaining to me. It was a too violent depiction of real life and, overall, it did not reflect much hope. Second, I found Leonardo's character's eventual compassion too little and too late to believe.This movie was highly recommended to me by several people. I guess it just is not my cup of tea."
2,"EDWARD ZWICK, OPUS 8","** 2006. Directed by Edward Zwick. Five nominations for the Academy awards. A mercenary helps a refugee to meet up with his family in exchange for a very rare pink diamond. Edward Zwick's filmography alternates the best likeLegends of the Fall (Special Edition)orCourage Under Fireand the worst likeThe Siege (Martial Law Edition)or this BLOOD DIAMOND. Besides Leonardo DiCaprio's superb performance, the film is a total disaster. You can't explain Africa's drama in 120 minutes by using Hollywood clichés. Either you decide to film an adventure movie in Africa either you shoot a committed film about the exploitation of African soil by western or eastern countries. Too bad Edward Zwick forgot this elemental axiom."
4,Above than average,"The product is good, the film itself is magnificent.There are 2 big cons:1. There is always a piracy warning at the beginning you cannot skip, which tell you you will sent 2 federal prison if you copy bla bla bla...2.I paid the seller high shipping cost and he just use the most cheap USPS and dispose it in front of our building ladder, I was lucky there was no one trample it."
4,Terrific HD-DVD experience,"I'm only reviewing the HD-DVD version of the disc as other reviewers have commented on the movie itself. Blood Diamond is another strong HD-DVD title that delivers great interactivity while viewing the movie. There are numerous branching production videos that show how a particular scene was shot. The running Picture-in-Picture commentary is fantastic too. Although it's not continuous video commentary (like Mission Impossible III), it's well worth watching. Another interesting aspect of the video commentary is that many of the comments were taken on-set between takes. So you have DiCaprio, Connelly or Hounsou talking about their roles on location. As with most modern movies on hi-def disc, the picture and sound is stellar. Recommended to show of your HD home theater system!"
3,So-So,"So-so predictably Hollywood movie, spattered with video-game violence, evil white man meets stoic black man in search of his family, throw in a sexy girl reporter in search of the big story... Seriously this movie was up for the Oscars?Some nice shots of Africa though, see it for that if you must, otherwise its pretty much a miss, unless you enjoy being dazzled by cartoonish violence and overdone stereotypes. If you already didn't know where diamonds came from, or know the evils of the thinly disguised DeBeers, perhaps this is a movie for you, otherwise steer clear..."
2,DUD DIAMOND,"Hollywood takes an acceptable story,lengthens it,brutalizes it, convolutes it,then apparently asks DiCaprio to save the film for the viewing audience.Leo does his best with some realistic,mature acting, but this is not a movie that can be dominated by one man( a la Jason Bourne).If you're a DiCaprio fan, you'll probably enjoy his acting. Otherwise,this production is little more than a dud."
4,have you heard about tantalum?,"I don't want to review this movie much since it is already covered by many folks. It is a good movie to watch. I just want to focus on similar subject about blood money. Tantalum is the material used in high tech industry primarily cell phones. Due to global demand of cell phones, companies have explored Congo. Did this blood money help to fuel a bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo? Darfur crisis (Sudan-China oil/gas and arms trade connection) - Is money received from China is prolonging Darfur crisis? . These topics also need to be researched. Also, do watch how arms industry participate in supplying arms in special features (second disk) in Lord of War (Nicolas Cage)."
4,Enjoyed this movie,I really enjoyed this movie. Leonardo Dicaprio does a great job with a great story.I could not wait for it to be available on HD-DVDThe picture quality and sound were great.
4,Blood Diamond,"'Blood Diamond' is one of DiCaprios better films and one that leaves you thinking about the issues it explores long after the credits have rolled. All the actors play their roles well and the locations make for some stunning scenery. The storyline is pretty shocking at times and it feels like it is half action movie and half political commentary. The issues around blood diamonds are explained pretty well and it'll make you think twice about those innocuous sparkly stones that we see everywhere. As other reviewers have noted, the film is excellent, but the sanitised, saccharine Hollywood ending spoils what is a powerful film, with an important message. Overall though, I'd say this film is well worth watching, it will keep you engaged the whole way through and is well shot and acted. A directors cut without the last five minutes would be great!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Introduction to Chemical Thermodynamics,"Chemical thermodynamics is the heart of the basic concept of cell biology. As an oncologist and pharmacologist, understanding the concepts of thermodynamics has allowed me to better appreciate cancer biology and design new cancer drugs. This book may initially not be appreciated by non-chemists, but the simplist, methodical method to explain the laws of thermodynamics will allow one to easily understand the topic and move to ""Energy Changes in Biochemical Reactions' also written by Dr. Klotz; a real 'must' for experimental and investigative oncologists. Please read and enjoy.Energy Changes in Biochemical Reactions"
5,An Unknown Gem,"Well, it's a short book, so this is a short review. And judging by its Amazon ranking, I doubt anyone is reading this... But if you are, then hey, listen: ""Princess"" is a wonderful story. Wonderful in this case being ""charmingly demented yet deeply moving."" First half is told while she, our Princess, is manic, second half while she, our Princess, is depressive. But there's nothing depressing about the novel, in fact it is laughoutloud funny. So all in all an easy read, a rewarding read, and a superb, subtle ending. Quite... wonderful. Yeah."
3,"Too much overlap between levels 1, 2, and 3 of these sight word flash cards","I purchased all three levels of sight word flash cards and discovered that there's no discernible difference in level between them, and lots of common sight words are not included. I also expected to see more words that don't follow common rules of English pronunciation, so they have to be learned by sight. There's also some duplication between the different sets. Not particularly useful."
2,Nice to See - Poor Picture Quality,"This DVD combines two previously televised concerts in to one DVD. First 10 songs are from 2004, very cool to see the band play the older songs, the sound quality is very decent, but the picture is poor. I think the lack of picture quality is due to the age of the footage, it was never intended to be on a 1080p Hi-Def Flat Screen. The producers of the DVD probably never went back and got the masters to upgrade the picture.The last three songs (Fans and Arizona are great on this) is much better; still not HD, but sound and picture are good enough.If you are a big KOL Fan its worth checking out, just know going into it, that this DVD has its limitations."
1,Bad Audio/Video,"not much more to say about it...great footage and potential but,the audio and video is not much better than terrible!"
3,A little rough around the edges,"Before Jailbreak, Thin Lizzy had already recorded a few albums, but with the exception of that old Irish folk tune ""Whiskey In The Jar"" (This is where Metallica got the idea for their version)they had found little chart success. This collection shows some of their early promise, and also the roughness that seemed to prevent them from achieving success. With tunes like ""The Rocker,"" ""Mama Nature Said,"" and ""Little Darling,"" you hear the band's hard rock roots, but there are just as many misses, like ""Sara,"" and the unending ""Shades of a Blue Orphanage"" which is just as pretentious as its title sounds. Fans of the band, who have had difficulty finding the early material, might find this a needed addition to their collection."
3,not a strong and deep rock album,"the songs themselves are good, OK, but the arrangement and the orchastration is not satisfactory. you hear ""thin"" sounds from the instruments. you cannot feel a depth in the album.."
1,Meet the dissapointment !!!,"Wow, I can not believe that two of the best songs of the film were cut off. 1.- Rock and roll part II ( Gary Glitter) and 2.-Get it on (T. Rex).The rest has been said in the other costumers reviews."
4,Pernambuco Calling,"Otto was one of the founders, alongside Chico Science and Fred 04, of the Mangue Beat, participating as percussionist in both Nao Zumbi and mundo livre s/a. In 1998 he released this his first album, ""Samba Pra Burro"". Produced by Apollo 9. Support from DJ Soul Slinger. It mixes drum'n'bass with regional music from the Brazilian northeast - maracatu, forró.... Bebel Gilberto makes an appearance on ""Bob"". The album was followed up by ""Changez Tout - Samba pra burro dissecado,"" a double CD of remixes by Brazilian producers and DJs - Camilo Rocha, Patife, Ramilson Maia, Marky Mark, André Abujamra, Apollo 9, etc"
3,A little difficult to get in the mood!,"It's not a easy album, but after a few minutes we start to understand the music, and the rythm. It's very important, specially for a music research, to understand the mix between the guy born a Recife, with very important music roots, based on the slaves music, and the iberic music, and all the influence from the modernity, felt when he uses the drum 'n' bass. I could tell, in my point of view, it's something different that worths be in your collection if you are like the electronic rythms or if you are open mind. Otherwise, careful, but it should be evaluated."
5,"Yeah, baby!!!",Talk about a time machine!! Love it...love it...love it!! Listening transforms who you are to who you were.....what you were doing...who you were with...A different time and different place...a different life ago!We've all been there...we all loved it...it's more than great to go back!!You just can't get enough.
3,70s music,I liked some of the songs on the album but not all.I really was not a fan of 70s music.But the songs i liked i had to get the whole album to get those songs.
1,THE REAL 70's,"If there was a 0 for a rating, I certainly would apply it here. How in the worldare we supposed to know what these songs are unless we have an option to actuallyhear samples of a few, if not all of the songs that are on this CD?"
2,Cheap Design,"I purchased this item since it was cheap and looked well made. When I got it I like the rubberized feel. I fit on my belt pretty well and I was happy. A few weeks later the hinge on the belt clip broke off. After closer inspection, it was obvious the amount of plastic securing the metal pin in place was woefully inadequate.If they can make the hinge more robust then I would buy a replacement. Until then, DO NOT buy this item. It will most certainly break after a few weeks of light use."
3,New Readers Digest Package?,These are excellent songs but albums are still available. I really find this idea totally wretched.
3,Unsure. Is this how I'm supposed to feel?,"Being the last (and unfinished) work of the brilliant, but very bizarre writer Franz Kafka, this book weaves a strange tale of supposedly autobiographic search and discovery. It is difficult and anguishing to read this book, and I wonder if Kafka would have really wanted it published had he not died before finishing writing it. It feels like a long swim upstream in a cold river, which numbs the senses. But somehow you want to know what happens to the main character, K. Does he succeed in his plans? Is his success also subject to the laws of perception set up in this story? If you can make it through this one, you might have a greater appreciation for Kafka's other works, such as ""The Metamorphosis"" and ""The Trial"" (and maybe all other books!). I have to say, his style is certainly unique, but I think I appreciated it much more in his other writings."
5,Una novela que resume la innata angustia del ser humano.,"Al leer esta novela, el lector sentirá esa sensación de desesperación caraterística de las obras de Kafka que representan de alguna manera la angustia que el ser humano siente por la ignorancia de su destino y fundamentalmente de su objetivo y del motivo por el que ha sido puesto sobre la tierra. Pocas obras han representado esta angustia tan común en todos nosotros, pero sin duda, ninguna ha penetrado en nosotros tanto como ésta."
1,Beware! This page refers to the Muir translation,"The reviews on this page refer to the newest edition and translation of The Castle, but the publication being advertised on this page is the old, error-filled Muir translation. Look inside the book and check the copyright information to avoid ordering by error. I made the mistake of ordering from this page and received the Muir translation, which I already had in an older printing."
3,No Gates,"The most amazing thing about the castle, is Kafka's relation to it...the fact that Kafka died just before he was going to write the chapters in which K finally got into the castle. I do no believe this story is one of futility. I don't think that's what Kafka meant. Nor do I think he intended humor. Instead, I look at the castle as a testament to daily drudgery. The idea that our lives have little meaning beyond the present. Nothing is definite...and so, it is an abstract monumnet. Characters are whimsical in the face of adversity, but ultimately, their motives are uncertain, and their feelings are unknown. A little too close to reality for me...but a good work."
2,I Love Kafka But This Novel Is Not So Great,"I've had a lifelong obsession with Kafka, but his novels I can do without. This book is very tedious to get through, and if the point is to make me experience firsthand that that's how dealing with bureaucracy feels--tedious, then I can just go wait in lines at my local DMV for that big revelation. Better to read any of his short stories. There was a reason these novels weren't published in his lifetime--even he himself felt they weren't quite finished or ready for the reader's eye."
1,Boring and Depressing,"If you want repetition and boredom and to be depressed in your soul, then read this book... Don't expect to finish it though!"
3,Wanted to love it,"Kafka and I have something in common: neither one of us finished this book. I really wanted to like this book. I think the dense prose and lengthy dialogue without a paragraph break got to be too much for me. It's one of those books I appreciate, but that I'm not anxious to pick up and read. The concept is fascinating. But I feel like I got the message fairly early on. The story itself was kind of dull. I stopped at page 165. I'm guessing it's more of the same: K struggles against an unknown bureaucracy, refuses to give up, he makes no progress, in fact, things get worse, and then it ends mid-sentence. But don't necessarily take my word. My most here rave about the book."
2,The What?,"The idea behind ""The Castle"" and the ryhthm in which it is written is genius, yet the story, central to K's whinning and conversational tangents--not all too interesting-- quickly becomes obnoxious. ""The Castle"" is slow, and a hard read. It would have been better if it was a short story."
2,I feel sorry for the main character and the reader,"I didn't really like _The Metamorphosis _ when I read it about 5 years ago so I thought it was time to give Kafka a try again.Wrong!If what he was trying to do was portray the hopelessness/uselessness of bureaucracy then he succeeded but the experience of reading the story was anything but enjoyable. Everyone in the story seems to know about everything that happens in the book and they all take turns analyzing the situation(s) ad nauseum. But none of the theories are ever proved true or untrue, and as many know, the story ends in the middle of a sentence leaving ABSOLUTELY no resolution to the problem.I guess I'll wait another 5 years and try _The Trial_ or _Amerika_."
2,Not Worth it...,"Because it's unfinished, it comes across more as a manuscript or rough draft than an actual novel. In The Metamorphasis and The Trial, Kafka focused on the main characters, but here he drones on and on about the ins and outs and the over all maze-like beaurocracy (sp?) of the castle. It gets redundant. And if that's not bad enough, a civil servant lectures the hero in full blown metafictional hogwash about the mechanics of castle politics for a whole chapter, while the hero, Josph K, is super tired, and just wants to fall asleep! I feel your pain, dude. The version i read had no ending and stopped mid sentence."
3,Very sneaky indeed!,"It is a pity that it wasn't until the book's abrupt end that my interest finally piqued. So many questions unanswered. Disappointed with the verbosity and seemingly needless details throughout most of the book, I was suddenly left facing the cliff hanger of all cliff hangers! The author is dead! I will never have my pressing questions answered! It makes me wonder whether Kafka actually meant to do this. Very sneaky indeed!I know that K. must be Kafka, but what is the Castle? Acceptance as a Jew in Nazi Germany? It seems too obvious, but perhaps a simple explanation will suffice."
1,Which translation?,"Kafka is one of my all time favorite writers, but try as I might, I can't get through the Mark Harman translation of The Castle ... it comes across like a laundry list of details, at least compared to the other versions I've read.A tour de force of literal accuracy, perhaps, but it just isn't funny."
5,"my son's nickname is ""Teapot""","We have been singing this multiple times a day for a few months now. My 2yr old son loves all of Iza Trapani's books that we have, but requests ""Teapot"" the most. You know the tune and the extra verses are full of adventure and easy to remember after 20 times through it. The illustrations are great and have had my son excited to find the fox and where the teapot is hiding."
4,Cute and interesting,"This is cute book with wonderful illustrations. I never knew there was more than one verse to ""I'm a little teapot..."""
5,Satisfaction guaranteed,"I received this book from my dear sister, who teaches 1st/2nd Grade and always finds the best books. This is my favorite book by Iza Trapani, consisting of a familiar tune with the familiar lyrics and fun twist of new lyrics that the illustrations accentuate. This is one of the few books I can read simultaneously to both of my sons (2 1/2 and 4 1/2) without one getting bored or the other losing interest - and that after almost 2 years!! Satisfaction guaranteed!!"
2,"Cute, but not our favorite Trapani book",This could be a really cute book. It has great text/lyrics and we love the teapot's sense of adventure. I'd give the book a five star rating if it weren't for the strange choices of including bullfighting and fox hunting. Surely Trapani could have found adventures for Mexico and England that weren't so animal unfriendly.
4,Book Review,"Book was delivered promptly . . . item was listed as ""like new"" but had another childs name witten with marker in large letters in the front and several band aides stuck in the book. Thought the condition was over stated . . ."
4,Good but outdated,"Though the Green Bible has been the best in the southeastern US for the past 30 years, and is still the best published manual for the Carolinas, it's in dire need of updating. Taxonomy for many of the species has changed, many more species have been discovered in the Carolinas since it was written (some native, some exotic), and the dot maps reflect what was know about species 30-40 years ago and don't necessarily reflect what is known about current ranges (also, the county dots aren't always backed up by occurrence records deposited in herbaria and thus are difficult to confirm)... overall, a wonderful publication, but one in need of a modern overhaul."
4,One Great Goal - A Hundred Amazing Stories,"Under the auspice of being a book dedicated to insight into the creation of a retirement community for the changing modern world this book emerges more a collective of fascinating snapshots into the lives of amazing American citizens. Much like an NPR article, the brief rememberances of the insightful and open-minded senior citizens of the Montgomery Place Retirement Community are captivating and shed light on how we have become the society we are today in America. The stories in this book should be of interest to anyone who respects the wisdom of elders, who studies sociology or who just misses the amazing tales told by their greatly missed parents or grandparents."
3,Quality Product,"I purchased this item last year to clean up the body lift install on my 98 S-10 Blazer 4x4. Everything was included to install these gap guards. It does require a fair amount of work to install these correctly and alot of fitting and moving around before installing. Make sure you have a spring loaded punch tool, which can be bought faily cheap at any hardware store. This will be useful in putting holes in the rubber and will leave it clean without tearing and spliting, like if you used a screw driver. You will be required to drill a fair amount of holes to install these properly, so if you don't have a cordless drill, you might want to borrow one. For the price though, I was expecting more and a better fitting product, but with a little hands on, you'll have this installed in a bit of time."
4,Just what I ordered,Works fine. However I would get a converter cable rather than adapter if I were to buy a part for the job again. The adapter takes up a lot of space that makes use of adjacent connectors difficult.
4,it works,"the converter works. I am having some resolution problems when i connect my dell inspiron netbook to an LCD monitor via the convertor. i get clear picture for a very low resolution and get a pinkish hue when i increase the resolution.i think it, might be a laptop issue rather than the connector.shipped in less time than they mention."
3,The product never showed up.,"I waited, and it never came.I wrote an email, where they had me call them.After talking to someone, she informed me that they no longer had the product in stock.They gave me a refund that was in my account within two days."
3,fits well,"Fits well, If you are planning on using this on the CPU box, you have to consider that on attaching teh DVI cable to this and putting into the HDMI slot in CPU added a significant depth and could not fit the CPU box in the table and close the door. Instean opting for the swith on the monitor is better. This worked prefectly except for this issue."
5,Great product,Fast delivery. Worked as expected. Hook to an Acer monitor from a Panasonic SA-BA300 with my computer. No need to buy an expensive HDTV now.
4,Did the job,It did what I needed. My machine outputs HMDI and my monitor came with DVI and DVI Cable. This bridged the gap. It does extend the connection by a few inches so take that into account when ordering. It may push your cable into places it cannot bend.
5,Works Great!,Couldn't believe the price was so cheap! Works perfectly! I use it on my PS3 to connect it to my monitor through my DVI input. Best buy on Amazon ever!
2,It Didn't Work,"I have an older Samsung DVD player with a DVI output and cable. I bought this adapter in the hope that I could complete the video signal to the HDMI input on my TV set. No dice. The supplier was interested in knowing my experience, confirmed that the application should have worked, apologized and issued a refund. FIVE STARS for customer service but something much less for the product they sold me."
1,sucks,"This has been the worst online ordering experience I have ever Had.I eforcity is the worst company I have ever dealt with online. It took them 3 weeks to send me my adapter, and when I finally received it it was the wrong one.So I ordered another one. Again I received the wrong adapter. When I asked them to send me something different of equal value they refused. So I asked for a FULL refund of both my orders but they only will refund ONE!!I would never order from amazon.com again because they condone this kind of BAD business."
2,eh..,"it was alright because it did the job it was suppost to do. but the problem is that when you put a heavy dvi cable on this, thats a lot of weight on a little hdmi connector. i move my computer alot and broke it after 3 months."
2,THE INFERIOR SEQUEL,"ASIDE FROM SOME NICE ZOMBIE F/X, ""RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD II"" IS A MESS. LET'S START WITH THE CONS... THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY ANNOYING, THE UNFORGIVABLE ONE LINERS ARE NON-STOP (EXAMPLE: ""MAKE MY NIGHT!""), BEYOND BAD DIALOGUE (EXAMPLE: YOUR BRAIN SMELLS RICH & SPICY.""), THE ACTING IS WORSE THAN YOU MIGHT IMAGINE, THE STORY HAS YOU ASKING THE QUESTION ""WAS THERE A SCRIPT?"". AFTER ALL THIS YOU MIGHT SAY ""BRIAN, WHY EVEN 2 STARS?"". THIS IS WHERE I GIVE YOU THE FILMS ONE PRO... THE ZOMBIES DO LOOK COOL. I LIKED THE F/X & THE GORE MAKE-UP. THIS SEQUEL IS ONLY WORTH YOUR TIME IF YOU TRULY GET INTO GORE F/X AND YOU CAN LOOK PAST THE MANY FAULTS JUST FOR THEM."
2,pale imitation,"I was very disappointed in this sequel. Actually, rather than being a sequel, it's a slight varied version of the original. It lacks the humor of RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, and the actors don't appear to be as enthusiastic as in the first one. Basically, a tremendous letdown."
2,Dissapointing,"I'm a big fan of zombie movies, and the first return of the living dead was a very good zombie movie. This one, however, fails to scare nor hold your attention, and tries harder in my opinion to be funny instead of scary. The black humor is pathetic, espechialy compared to the first one. Had its interesting moments, but the movie as a whole was definitly below average."
3,Entertaining and Funny,"When I watched this movie movie for the first time, I got dissapointed, because it was not what I had expected. But this movie is actually good. I sure get a laugh when the zombies are going out to have some brains. You cannot really call this a typical horror-film, it's more like a ""horror-comedy"". The negative side of the film, is that it gets boring towards the end. But if you dont got this movie in your collection, then it's defently worth a buy!"
4,Whats up with the soundtrack???????,"I had seen all the ROTLD movies when they came out years ago, so i bought the first and the 3rd on dvd, which made no since why they didnt have the second one out. I was so glad when I bought my copy and imagine my surprise when I start to watch the film and notice that all througought the movie the soundtrack is different than the way it was for the theaters. That mad me angry enough, then as I was switching over to the commentary I find out that the original soundtrack is in the dubbed french audio but not english....Go Figure!!!!!! The movie is still great and cheezy though"
3,Another Zombie Comedy! This Is A Good One,"I really liked the first one, and I thought it was better. But, this one is pretty funny, too. The special effects are really good. This is the one to rent, along with the first.If you watch closely, two actors from the first, return in the second.It's better to rent the first. It's much better. And it also shows you how this mess was started."
3,Overall a good movie but the first ROTLD was WAY better!,"I loved the first movie so much. This one was good and I would watch it again & again, but the frst Return was the ulimate in Zombie movies. It was scary and funny. I WANT YOUR BRAINS TINA!!!"
1,anyone who owns this tape should burn it.,"THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE BUT THE ONLY REASON I SAW IT WAS BECAUSE I SAW ""THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD"" ON TNT AND I DESIDED TO RENT IT AND I ACCIDENTALLY PICKED THE WRONG ONE AND WHEN I WAS DONE WATCHING IT I WAS SO P*SSED THAT THEY MADE A COMEDIC VERSION THAT I RETURNED IT TO BLOCKBUSTER THE SAME NIGHT I RENTED IT..."
4,"Regardless of what others say, it was a good film.","It starts off with 2 characters from ROTLD (who died) playing other roles, so you get a whiff that this film is not serious. But it was funny and worth owning!So go out and do it."
5,I like it!,"When i was 13 i went to my grandparents to stay, As she collects movies and i had been a fan of the zombie genre since i was six i went through my grans books that catalogued all her films. I isolated all the zombie movies she owned and watched them over the course of 2 days. the ones i remembered (id already seen night, dawn and a few others) were the return series. One Two and Three are amazing. Two is well directed, slapstick but with very good make-up on the zombies which is a blessing (Non-Fulci) I'm going to buy it asap even though i have it on aged VHS.All fans of zombies add me to messenger rottedzombieauthor@hotmail.com and if you want to read my story go here, www.homepageofthedead.com in the fiction section called ""David's Story"""
1,"Not funny, not scary, not really worth your time.","That this poorly conceived sequel was from the man who made the excellent aquatic zombie thriller Shock Waves (aka Death Corps) makes it all the more painful to watch. There are a few humorous moments that play off the first (and so superior) movie, my favorite being a dialogue exchange from the first movie recreated word for word (with the same actors), just the setting and emotional delivery is different. Nice touch there, too bad the rest of the movie is not as sly and inventive. It's just another painfully unfunny/unscary 'horror/comedy'."
1,Return Of the living Dead Part II.I remember seeing this growing up.More like a Bad Comedy than horror.,"Silly plot,Disgusting,Makes no Sense and not scary just done for being done I guess. Not even good by Cult Classic standards."
1,"Bad, really bad!","I had not seen this film in years! I remembered it being okay, however after 19 years have passed, it has aged tremendously. The score is bad, bad acting, stupid zombies that look like extras from Thriller, and funny scenes that are not even funny. Stick with the first one."
2,"""Still a fun sequel, but bad bad bad very bad dvd!""","Okay, I would be surprised if it had some additional scenes or extra bloody gore scenes or whatever, but not changing the scores and music, what the hell was that additional dialouge has been dubbed, in the scene when Freddy starting to eat Brenda's brain, it was off track!!! When I first got the dvd, I was thrilled, but I start watch it, my ears, my eyes, and my mind just zapped, like something wrong with movie, something different, I was mad, even the director on the commentary wasn't satisfied of the track, I know all of us fans felt the same way. I love the first movie and the second movie. Movie still good, I'm okay with it, but I they can redo this, like first film did, the special edition with the original track, GOD I hope!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Funny Zombie Movie,"I am a big fan of the Return Of The Living Dead series. My favorite on out of the series is part 1, but this is my second favorite. It has alote more comedy in it than the first one. I really like the whole cast which includes one of my favorite actress Suzanne Snyder (who played Debbie in Killer Klowns From Outer Space) The Spec FX in this movie are just as good as in part one. The movie starts off with an army truck dilivering some barrels which include dead bodies in them, and a gas which makes dead things come back to life. Everything is going smoothly untill one of the barrels falls off the truck into a sewer, thats when all the trouble begins. I recomend this movie alote."
2,**Not the Best Zombie Flick**,"Well, to start out, I would like to safely say that Return of the Living Dead Part II is definatly NOT the greatest zombie movie I've seen ... The zombies that the creators have chosen are terrible compared to it's predissesor zombies in ROTLD part I. ... I want to become just the least bit scared. Not with ROTLD 2. This movie is definatly one to see with the kids if you've got 'em!! ..."
3,ACCEPT IT FOR WHAT IT IS!,"This film sets out to get some laughs and screams. It is not a serious film such as Dawn of the Dead and should not be evaluated as such. It has some good scares and features zombies, but also has some good scenery such as the graveyard and the eerie feeling neighborhood under construction. It is not as scary as the first ROTLD but ressurects the things that made the first one enjoyable. Do not buy this movie if you like serious horror films and good acting! I enjoyed this spoof of the Romero 'Dead' films, just don't expect anything thought provoking!"
2,"Not funny, not scary, not really worth you time.","That this poorly conceived sequel was from the man who made the excellent aquatic zombie thriller Shock Waves (aka Death Corps) makes it all the more painful to watch. There are a few humorous moments that play off the first (and so superior) movie, my favorite being a dialogue exchange from the first movie recreated word for word (with the same actors), just the setting and emotional delivery is different. Nice touch there, too bad the rest of the movie is not as sly and inventive. It's just another painfully unfunny/unscary 'horror/comedy'."
2,Are looking for a serious zombie movie? Keep looking,"This was a good movie if you like original living dead movie this is it but if you want a terrifying movie rent The Night Of The Living Dead 1990. I'm not trying to insult this movie, it had its moments and it was kind of funny but not scarry"
4,Funny as a Freddy Kruger Flick,"It was hilarious when one zombie was trying to get out of his grave and kept getting steeped on by other dim-witted zombies. When i first watched this movie when it came out in 1987 when i was seven years old, it scared the living (dead) outta me. I didn't see the comedy in it. It made me scared of the night outside for a few years. But thats watcha get when your dad rents every horror movie at the local video store. A few years ago, i faced my fears and rented this movie again and really enjoyed it. Anywho, i believe its fun to be afraid every once and awhile. If you liked this flick, you'll enjoy Dawn of the Dead, or any of the three Evil Dead flicks. later gaters."
2,A BAD sequel,"A total disapointment for a sequel. I found this movie in the horror section, but it should be found in the comedy section. Return of the living dead , while it does have it's comical moments, was full of suspence and gore. This dissapointing sequel lacked replaced the gore with more comedy and poor dialog. The worst scene was at the end where a zombie dressed like Michael Jackson comes out doing a breakdance electrocution."
2,Proves again Sequels aren't Equals,"Return of the Living Dead is an awsome zombie film that I wish would really get re-released on video and DVD. Return of the Living Dead Part II is another one of those sequels that doesn't measure up. ROTLD2 does relie more on comedy than horror, but it ain't no Evil Dead II. ROTLD2 still has it's funny moments, but overall the film is corny and laughable (Especially the Michael Jackson zombie scene, corny). If you like zombie films, checks ROTLD2 out, otherwise steer clear."
1,This version is unwatchable-don't buy,"I read the reviews below and still bought this thinking ""so what, how bad can the new track be?"" BAD. The entire music track has been replaced with tooting techno-pop circus music. Not just songs, but every little piece of musical sound used to create tension is replaced. So, for example where you used to have a scary scene that had a wall of violins playing and sharp scary sounds to help the scene, you now have tooting circus music that sounds like it was produced on a $50 Sears keyboard. To the people below that said ""so what"", switch it over to the french version when you hear the tooting, and hear what its supposed to sound like. Why Warner would do this is baffling (obviously they have the rights to the sounds, since they are still there in the French track. Also, I have never heard of the rights to a movie being seperate from the background music)."
4,FINALLY THIS FILM GETS A RELEASE!,"Yes finally ROTLD 2 is released on DVD! And I'm also surprised and glad that there is a commentary track, but be warned, it is slightly different. The music is different. I'm very disappointed by the crap music track that has replaced the original. The director on the commentary also points this out about the replacement with this dreadful musical score.I love the original score to this film. Lucky I had the video version transfered onto DVD, so one might want to consider doing that. But most definitely buy this DVD for the commentary. It's a good listen from the director and one of the actors from the film.All in all, I LOVE the Return of the Living Dead series!"
3,Eh.,"I liked this as a child, and I had to own it, as it was part of my childhood memories of hanging out with my little brother, watching horror movies all night long and scaring each other senseless. After I bought it and watched it again, I realized why as a kid I liked it, and why as an adult I thought it was pure crap. The jokes are cheesy, the characters goofy and laughable, the music godawful. Any kid would relish that. But as a horror connoisseur and sadly a much older person, all I have to say is, bleeccchhh. It's cute, I still get a giggle out of Brenda's brains being ""rich and spicy"", but that's about it. Good to see once while you're home watching other gems such as Halloween 2 and Child's Play 3 on TBS."
4,fun fun fun,"It's nice to have a serious zombie film(which usually doesn't happen with most of the past efforts 'cause they are too extreme and tend to become funny), but it's fun to take a break from that a watch something like RTLD 2. It doesn't live up to the first -it's a hoot, though. Why anyone would not like this movie, I don't know.Too bad we don't see Linnea Quigley jumping around nekkid in this one. Check it out !"
1,This Movie Sure Is DEAD!,"This movie was really dumb.The only thing I loved about it was the cast and settings.All through the movie zombies yell out BRAINS,BRAINS,BRAINS,and more BRAINS!I think Return of the Living Dead 3 is better than this!"
1,"No more brains, for now!?","Terrible. I can remembr being sucked in because i loved the original so much, and just being confused by awful acting, fx, and ""comedic"" zombies doing pratfalls. Also, there is a doctor that is obviously retarded. Stick with the original.And speaking of the original, will there ever be a release that uses the original soundtrack? It was changed during rerelease! Luckily, I taped the film from Cinemax ten years ago!"
1,few major glaring problems,this movie had a great plot line. great action. great cast. great dialouge. great special effects. it was really funny. other than these minor points THE MOVIE [was bad].
1,what a joke,"I went to see this movie in 1988 with a lot of expectations but i found out that this is not even a sequel,the zombies are different and nothing make sense,is just a silly comedy.In reality the original ROTLD dont have any sequels,they only use the name to make this jokes with different directors.ROTLD is unique and is too bad there was never a real sequel from director Obannon."
1,I Want Your Brain!,"This is not a George A. Romero project.Directed and written by Ken Wiederman. Film contains profane language, gross bloody effects.Thom Matthews returns as a different character, ""Joey"", James Karen returns as a different character, ""Ed"", Jonathan Terry returns as ""Glover"", Allan Trautman returns as ""Tarman"". Brian Peck returns as 5 different zombies, ""Pussface"", ""Thriller"", ""Jaw"", ""Eye-Pop"" and the zombie on the car roof.A truck that is traveling across a bridge is carrying pressurized cases that contain cadavers. One case falls off the truck and ends up in the water. A group of kids find the case and triggers the gas inside that spreads across the cemetary. The living dead return.Also in the cast: Thor van Lingen, Dana Ashbrook, Mitch Pileggi.DVD only contains audio commentary and theatrical trailer."
1,Loved it as a kid... then I grew up.,"'Return of the Living Dead Part II' tried to re-capture the lightning-in-a-bottle so brilliantly achieved by the original. It fails on all levels. This time around the comedy is more abundant, but nothing is funny here. The effects are bad, the acting is atrocious... and THE MUSICAL SCORE HAS GIVEN ME EAR CANCER. I found out shortly after viewing this turd that the music on the DVD is not the original score. Believe me, 'ROTLD2' might be a hair better if the original music was in place, but it's still a failed attempt at zombie comedy. I felt bad for James Karen and Thom Matthews as they stumbled around trying to be like their characters from the first movie. It's really quite embarrassing to behold. Do yourself a favor and buy the excellent 'Return of the Living Dead' and pretend its four sequels never happened."
3,"A fun, funny horror spoof","Brain-hungry zombies rise in a small town after an accident involving chemicals. As the sequel to the much beloved original, part 2 is almost pure comedy, opting entirely for laughs. Good fun for undemanding genre fans."
2,Sad Attempt At A Zombie Flick,"As it usually goes, a military gas canister is opened(this time by a child)and the fumes cause the dead to rise and cause havoc among the living. This is more of a parody than a sequel but unfortunately, it is not that funny nor is is remotely scary. There are a few moments that will make you grin(zombie's stopping their attack momentarily as something good pops up on the t.v.)but nothing more. The effects are okay but nothing special and the rehashed plot feels like it was hastily thrown together without any effort or concern for originality. If you want something different in a zombie flick, try the 3rd installment of return of the living dead. It is a dark, depressing tale of impossible love that takes the zombie idea in a completely different direction...that of a teenager and his girlfriend, a lovely woman who has become a zombie."
1,"Movie gets 4, but the DVD gets 0","The people who put out this DVD have totally messed up the soundtrack. It all has to do with noise. First off, there's different music in the movie. Next, there are all these new and odd sound effects that are out of place. Why bother releasing the DVD at all, if they're not going to do it correctly???"
1,What's up with the Score?,"I should have listened to Harry from Ain't It Cool News. He warned fans that the music was differant on the DVD. But I thought he meant the songs. Losing the rights to songs, and putting different songs in their place for home video is nothing new. But it is the entire score that is different. And the new score is mind numbingly horrible. It completely ruins the movie. There is also a voice over narration at the beggining of the film that I don't remember being there in the theatrical or VHS version. And even more strange, is that when you switch over to the French language track, it is still the original score. This makes no sense at all. Warner Bros. really messed up with this one. I hope they re release it with the proper score. In the meantime, since I know Circuit City won't refund mt money, I'm going to see if Warner Bros. will."
3,Wanted this to be better,"I really enjoyed the first Return of the Living Dead. It was silly in some places, but it had some nice zombie effects, and a killer dark ending. The second picture is a little too over the top for me with the silliness. Just the bad 80's hair and music is enough to make you cringe. Thom Mathews and James Karen reprise (sort of) their roles from the first film. The ending leaves a bit to be desired. The third installment of the series is much darker and better than this one. But to be fair, part 2 is light years ahead of the recent direct to dvd sequels 4 and 5."
3,Good movie to revisit for fun,"Nothing will ever top the original return of the living dead, but this part II is fun to watch just for the fun of it. Like many have said before - the musical score is absolutely terrible in this dvd, but that can be looked over."
5,This is gotta see zombie movie for all horror fans!,"This movie is one of the best horror movies I have seen since NIGHT of the LIVING DEAD(1968)(B&W).Although it is a sequel, but this one is not like other sequels!You can watch it over and over and still get the shivers!!!!"
3,The film makers have reached their goal,Sequel to the original (which now cannot be found on video) has the same two not so bright grave diggers head hunting in a graveyard as a nearby body cannister is opened by some snoopy children and the dead once again come back to life. The original (which wasn't very funny at all) pales in comparison to this one which is very safe for children to view. The dead people are a lot less scary in this movie. They actually take on a Michael Jackson TRILLER attitude and make it safe to laugh this time. The doctor is pretty funny and Snyder (KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE) is great as Mathew's hyper girlfriend.
5,love this movie. good service.,"Thank you for such great customer service. Once I placed my order, it was in my mailbox fast.I will indeed do business with this seller again."
5,"I'm Gonna ""Start Over "" And Only Watch Good Movies From Now On!!!","This is a sorry excuse for a comedy starring Burt Reynolds and Jill Clayburgh . In this movie Burt is going through a traumatic divorce and his elder psychiatrist brother says to him""Call me if you get sad"" to which Burt replies 'Can I call you if I get happy?"". I was very sad watching this piece of junk at 3.00 a.m. but it was to late call anybody.The makers of this turkey of a movie should have ""started over"" and got a decent script. Also Candice Bergen proves once and for all that she can't sing!!! I give this movie 5 stars because I like Jill Clayburgh who showed so much promise once upon a time early in her career."
3,MONSTER,"I THINK IT SHOULD BE FOR THE YOUNGER KIDS, I GOT THROUGH IT TOO FAST AND JUST WAS NOT EXCITING FOR ME, GOT BORING REAL QUICK...MOM'S REVIEW-MY SON GOT THIS FOR HIS BIRTHDAY, OK HE IS 12, AND HE SAYS THIS IS TOO BABY A GAME FOR HIM TO PLAY BUT HIS YOUNGER COUSINS LOVE IT, IT IS FUN FOR THE YOUNGER KIDS BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR THE OLDER KIDS WHO AS THEY SAY ARE GAMEBOY ADDICTS...ITS A FUN GAME FOR ME TO PLAY BUT FOR THOSE WITH EXPERTISE ON THE GAMEBOY, GET SOMETHING HARDER THAT WILL NOT BORE THEM QUICKLY"
2,This is an okay game,"This game is fun at the beginninge but it gets old real quick. what I don't like about this game is that it has no save feature, all it does is give you a code at the end of each level and you have to remember it. I don't like this because I would write the code down on a piece of paper then I would lose the paper by accident. Another thing that I don't like about it is that it has very subtle changes between the easy, medium, and hard options."
2,Just say no,Bought this game for my 6 year old for Christmas and both of uswere very disapointed in the game. She has this game and Rugrats and she plays the Rugrats Castle Capers all the time and rarely picks up Monsters Inc. The game is not very fun to play and lacks the excitement of other GBA titles.
2,"Very short, but not linear either.","My first time through it was only 3-and-a-half hours later! But to add depth, you search through a maze of rooms to find 3 missing pieces to the door. Enemies aren't smart and are quite stupid. Bosses are slow and easy to beat. I recommend something else."
4,Monsters Inc,This game is great for the first few weeks but then it gets hard . It has great graphis and is just like the movie. I recamend you to buy it.
2,Kind of disappointing...,"The graphics are not so hot, and the game play is very boring. My 3 yr old son only played it for a few minutes before losing interest. We'll be trading this one in soon."
4,Don't waste your money,I bought this game for my 5 year old daughter who loved the movie. She won't play this on her gameboy at all. She plays with her sister's Nemo game. Don't waste your money.
2,Way way way too complicated,"This game is just way to complicated. I have been playing board, minature, card, and strategy games for years but this one ranks as the most confusing one I have played yet. It is far too complicated and my gaming friends agree.Buy a game of Talisman or another interesting fantasy game. Pass this one by!"
2,nice try,"I love the concept of everyone cooperating to reach the end of the game. If only more games were more cooperative and less competitive! However, I work at an elementary school after school program (with children in grades 2nd-7th), and this is one of the least played of all the games. It took almost the whole 90 minutes to get through the first board (what was it, Moria?) with the instructions in hand, and everyone forgot how to play 24 hours later. The rules are just too complicated. Perhaps one gets the hang of it after playing it through a couple times, but I doubt many groups of children can get through it the first time without an adult's help (but even the teacher who was overseeing the game couldn't figure it out totally, and I certainly could not get through it). But I'm more into games with simple rules like Checkers anyway."
4,A Good Game,This is a great game for any fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. I've played the game several times and continue to enjoy it. I can't wait for the expansions to come out.
1,Not as advertised!,"Not as advertised! I was deciding whether to get the cheaper version with cardboard cutouts instead of the more expensive version with miniatures and ring and all. I decided I would go ahead and get the more expensive version, and what do I get? The cheaper version. $80 for the same cheap version that I could have gotten for way less! Don't trust End Zone Hobby! They'll rip you off!"
5,Worth overcoming steep learning curve,"It takes a while to figure out all the rules, the numerous pieces, cards, tokens, dice, etc..., but it's a worthwhile endeavor if you can persevere. You don't have to know the story to play the game, so newbies can play too. The first 2 or 3 times we tried to play, turns would often stall as we checked the manual, but after that it flowed much more smoothly.The game is refreshing in that you play cooperatively - so if your household avoids competitive games because everyone hates to lose, you might give it a shot.Setup is slow the first few times, and you will do best if you have about a 3.5'-4' square surface to play on, and a few hours to finish the game. Don't bother playing on carpet - it's a mess. And put the cat outside or you'll be missing pieces...The game is challenging - it took us five or six tries before we ever won. And you can make it harder as necessary, change rules, and add players to keep it interesting. Well worth the price."
4,A cooperative game that's FUN to play,"I bought this and taught a couple young cousins (10 & 11 years old) how to play it fairly quickly. The game play is pretty linear so I'm not sure that it will necessarily have a long-term appeal, but in the short-term it's great fun (this, combined with the upcoming movie have inspired me to re-read the trilogy).The part about the game that makes it really unique is that ultimately you're playing against your own selfish instincts. It's less the game that beats you than your own desire to win. And that's a great, if subtle educational benefit to the game.(...)"
4,A Wonderful Cooperative Game,"This is an excellent game for those tired of playing AGAINST each other. The players MUST work together or all is lost. In this sense it is faithful to Tolkien's books.While I have some reservations about how many times it can be played before ""patterns"" of play emerge, the first 20 games I've played have been fun and fufilling.A quick game, beautifully package and produced. A wonderful addition to any collection. A must for those who don't need an individual winner."
1,Too Expensive to ship back,"I guess I'm stuck with this--it's too expensive to ship it back.I assumed this was a PAIR of weights totalling 20 lbs. Every other ""ankle weight,"" including the last 2 pairs I bought, came in a pair and the weight listed was the total weight."
3,Needs a steel pull-loop for the strap,"Pros: Heavy duty constructionCons: Very difficult to obtain a tight fit - especially in the heavier models. This means the slippery vinyl sides back and forth on your limbs as you use them.Fix: A steel loop strap would provide for a tight initial fit, which would then be secured by the existing Velcro.Conundrum: If you need HEAVY weights such as these, you likely won't find any alternatives. I couldn't."
2,Too Big and Too Expensive to send back,I purchased the 1/4 & 1/2 weight for my two year old who needs weight therapy for her upper body. This product is too big to fit around any part of her arms or wrists. Not a good product for small children. If you decided to buy be aware they are selling them as a single weight not as a set as you would buy most weights. And finally - with the 20% restocking fee and return freight - it's not worth it to send them back.
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I am not one of the sellers; however, the folks from whom I bought this video were wonderful. I have seen this video on public TV and wanted a copy for personal reasons. I was a dog handler in DaNang, RVN, 1967-1968, and this production stands out above all the rest. I sincerely wish it were on DVD, but then we can't have everything ... unless we're in politics...or a banker...or a CEO. You may be able to tell that the '60's humor is far from gone from this old warrior/hippie. However, thank all of you who made procuring this video possible. I am forever in your debt. (Well, sort of. I did, indeed, pay for the video)."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I guess I thought this would be a travelogue but it's kind of weird. Very poetic writing, which I suppose is good but I do not have an appreciation of it. I wanted more info about the terrain but this book didn't do the trick. Definitely not a travel book."
2,Disappointing,"If you are completely unfamiliar with ants then this movie will be informative- other wise its a let down. The movie does depict the very far diversity of ant life and the range of environments they live in and again, if you have no previous knowledge about ants then Ants will be very enlightening.Unfortunately, the movie is so very broad that it covers no species of ant in depth. I've watched a handful of Discovery-type documentaries on ants and was eager to learn more, but learned absolutely nothing new from this. The film focuses more on the give and take of a social insect society than on the ants themselves.I was very excited to recieve this DVD for christmas but after sitting through it once will never watch it again."
3,ants,A bit disappointed.. I expected more. it is good but not excellent. I cannot use it as a reference.
3,Ants: Little Creatures Who Run The World,"This has really good information as far as the ants, which was really amazing. I do not believe in evolution as I am a Christian and believe increation by God. My husband and I would not recommend it as heartily but would solely for the information about the ants. The different kinds of the ants themselves was really amazing because we never knew there were so many. It was interesting to see how they live, also."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the other reviews, I thought this was going to be a super machine. For $600 this small tiller should have a few more features, such as reverse, a separate control for the tiller tines and free wheeling (It does have a ""rinky dink"" free wheeling system that requires lifting the wheels off the ground, pulling the lynch pin and then sliding the wheels in--very inconvenient.) I found it to be really hard to use and required extra pushing to get it through my garden the first time. Maybe I expect too much out of a $600 machine, but I am really disapointed in its design and performance."
5,Even better than expected!,"This ended up being a terrific purchase. This tiller is small enough to be manageable (I'm only 5'3""), and it easily dug through our hard Georgia clay that is literally filled with rocks. I can hardly wait to use it again - I highly recommend it.The only down-side was the shipping. The company only delivered between 8 and 5 Monday-Friday. We missed the first attempt at shipment, but the driver was kind enough to come back to our house after he finished his route."
1,It Only Works on Win 98,"Can't say if it's a good game or not since we never got it to play. It only works on Windows 98 operating system and all attempts to get Windows XP to emulate Win 98 proved futile. If you're a techno wiz, you might get it to play but it's probably more work than it's worth."
3,Full House of Fox Stars,"This is a great film for O Henry fans and fans of some 20th-Century Fox favorites featured. The cast includes Fox superstars and contract players Jeanne Crain, Anne Baxter, and Richard Widmark, along side up-and-comers Jean Peters and Marylyn Monroe. Two of the best stories in the group: The Last Leaf, featuring Baxter and Peters and The Gift of the Magi, featuring Crain and Farley Granger. A nice package altogether for this classic omnibus feature film."
3,O. Henry Comes Alive!,"A neighbor told me about this 1952 film of 5 stories based on O. Henry's works. I was familiar with Gift of the Magi, which I think is the most popular and true example of the spirit of giving. Farley Grainger and Jeanne Crain star in this film and were the perfect choices of a young married couple on a meager budget trying to find the right gift for each other. The other short film I liked of this series was The Cop and the Anthem starring Charles Laughton, David Wayne, and Marilyn Monroe--a story of an irascible vagrant(Laughton) trying to get himself arrested to get a warm bed for awhile! These of course were in black and white but it was a nice light entertaining series of well acted films. The plus was the narrator in the person of John Steinbeck who gave a background on O. Henry."
1,Full House -- empty,The DVD O. Henry's Full House is not playable on my DVD player. There seems to be a code problem.
2,"Should be 'Based Upon', not in the possesive.","I am disappointed. William Sidney Porter in 'The Ransom Of Red Chief' never spoke of Bill and Sam riding into Summit, AL in an out of tune car. Nor did Ebenezer Dorset hold the position of sheriff. The locals had Down East accents, not a hint of Alabama Southern. There was no bear disrupting the campsite, and the hilarity of the ransom note is lost. Soapy of 'The Cop and the Anthem' didn't have a sidekick. The newspaper in 'The Clarion Call' was never called 'The Clarion,' but rather, 'The Morning Mars.' The scriptwriters could have and should have remained true to the stories, embellishing a little to stretch for time. However, the 2 stars come from the extras, which give a background on the O.Henry Museum n Austin, and the expert review of the author's life."
5,Classic short films,"I remember watching 2 of these short films many years ago on television, they were The Last Leaf and The Gift of the Magi. I still haven't watched them all yet and am really looking forward to them because I love O'Henry's Short Stories.I have often searched over the years to see if these were available so was thrilled when I found this DVD at Amazon.com. The Gift of the Magi really shows the love two people can feel for each other when they put the other person before themselves. All of these stories have great meaning and makes one think of gentler times when people had more consideration of others.I am sure I will enjoy all the films as much as the two aforementioned."
5,Great album!!!,"This album never really got it's full prop's. It was eclipsed by other artists at the time: Led Zeppelin's In Through the Outdoors, Fleetwood Mac's Rhumors, Steely Dan's Aja, Supertramp's Breakfast In America,... But this CD does deserve a second listen to the ex-Fleetwood Mac guitarist."
1,What a pleasant surprise,"Having not heard the album French Kiss for 20 years & now owning it on CD for the 1st time it came as a pleasant surprise that the majority of the songs sounded as fresh as they did all those years ago. Sentimental Lady could still be a hit today if recorded by the likes of Robbie or Westlife. Ebony Eyes is just a great pop song that should have topped the charts in 1977 but was just a minor hit. My 3 favs though are Caroline, Dancing Eyes & Danchiva which are great singalong rocky songs which in my dancing eyes have passed the test of time remarkably well. A couple of the songs are admittedly weak the only reason that i've given the album 4 & not 5 stars. I have lost my heart to the album (another good song being the repeated thro the album ""Lose Your"") & play it really loud to get the best from it."
1,"Yuck, and I thought this was good in it's time?","Before cds, Ipods and free downloads, the record companys really ripped off the consumers.This is just 2 decent songs (Sentimental Lady and Ebony Eyes) and the rest filler. There is even a lame song repeated three times! Back in the 70's, us ""dumb teenagers"" did not know better when they sold us LPs with 20 minutes worth of music. Now, in hindsight, it seems ridiculous.This just in not that good. Especially for a former Fleetwood Mac member, that was the best that he could do?!!. I can't imagine that anybody really respects this really lame album other than nostalgia buffs.The 2 good songs belong on a 70's compilation, the rest just is not quality stuff!I cannot understand why every cd on this website alwasy gets 4-5 stars. Those high ratings are deceptive. Every album cannot be great!"
4,I can't recall why...,"I bought this album back in 1977. During an album run my roomate and I purchased this pretty much based on the fact that we knew Bob from Fleetwood Mac.I don't think we had even heard ""Sentimental Lady"" on the radio before we bought this but actually that song is not even in my top 5 faves from this CD.I sequence the album starting with track 2.All the hooks, smooth vocals and good pop rock just flow from the speakers. This is a very good album. Other reviewers gave it 3 stars. I think it deserves 4.I bought this having not heard it for 15 years and it's gonna get worn out. Every song is as rich and powerful as I remeber.This IS Radio Rock. This IS Good Pop Rock.Sadly my disc has no liner notes. I'd like to know who backed up Bob on this album. I've heard Lindsey, Mick and Christine played on it. Anybody got the info? e-mail me please."
4,Nicely written,"The conquest of Mexico by Cortes viewed by Doña Marina ""La Malinche"" is a good novel with historical references but is mainly that woman's view which is interesting. Nicely written and easy to read."
3,Smooth arrangements and guitar work,This is NOT the blues group although the two groups are often confused on the Internet. This is the guitar instrumental group famous everywhere in the world except North America. This compilation is representative of their 80's sound: heavily produced and nothing like their lean sound of the early sixties (produced by the first Fender Stratocasters imported into England). This title provides a pleasant sound but offers nothing startling.
2,"""Looney Tunes Collector's Edition: Welcome to Wackyland""",The Clampett cartoons I've watched were on this video.
1,More like quadruple daily.,"The good news is this feeder regularly dispenses flake food (I haven't tried other foods). The bad news is it's a LOT of food since the adjustment level is really irregular and it actually feeds around 4.5 times per day. The amount of food this thing dispenses is ridiculous, especially if you only have a few fish. This thing will KILL your fish from overfeeding unless you have a decently big tank (I have a 6-gallon tank).I haven't tried the alternatives, but I highly suggest you pass on this one unless you have a 20+ gallon aquarium and 10+ fish.Update: I now use this to automatically feed pellet food to my turtle in a 30 gallon tank. He can take the extra feedings, although- he doesn't eat when this dispenses food at night so his tank gets dirty quickly."
1,Terrible,"I bought this product to use for vacation as well, but beware, if you are going to use it with flaked food. First, you must grind the flakes smaller to even get through the feeder. Also, when water started evaporating a little bit, all the food got wet and stuck in the feeder. I would not recommend this product!"
1,A piece of Junk,"I bought this feeder and it hasn't worked right from day one. It ticks like a clock, but it doesn't move an inch. I even marked it with a piece of tape so I could see if it is moving. I doubled checked the battery as well. This was extremely disappointing. I wouldn't trust this product to feed my fish even if it suddenly decided to work (which I don't think is going to happen)."
3,oh no,"I left my fish with this to feed them. just now saw all of these reviews now im worried. out of the box this thing is cheap plastic, and is branded with the date 1993, talk about old design. put in a fresh AA, filled it up with food, heard the ticking, so i assumed all was well. hope I dont go home to a bunch of starved clown loaches."
1,Useless....unless you're trying to screw up your tank,"I bought this useless contraption for about $12. The first problem is that, unless you have a huge tank...or tons of hungry fish...this thing dispenses way too much food. I spent an hour fiddling with tape and styrofoam to close the hole slightly, and thought I had it set. So I tried it out on the tank. Because it dispsenses a totally different amount of food each time it spins around, I was lucky enough (note the sarcasm) to have it, on my first trial above my tank, dump out about a week's supply of food into the water. Yay! The next hour was spent using siphons and gravel vacuums to try to suck up as much food as possible. I'm going to try to return it tomorrow to the store I got it from. Useless!"
1,Didn't think of that...,I thought this would be the solution to leaving my fish alone for a week. I tested the feeder for a week prior to leaving for vacation. Seeing that it worked properly I placed the feeder over the opening in my tank and left for vacation. The moisture that evaporates from the tank got into the feeder and made the flake food wet and unable to fall out the tube. Unfortunately all my fish died and I now know the reason no one has ever recommended this product to me before.
5,Worth the money,"I bought this for 10 dollars. I bought it mainly for vacations, so i tested it and it took a load of my hands, i just wanted to test it but now i use it daily. It holds a lot of food, and it distributes it evenly, and almost every 12 hours. Haven't had any evaporation problems yet"
2,Disappointing,I have five goldfish and was hoping to use this feeder during the holidays when I go home. It's so-so with flake food and with the little floating pellet food it's works alright if you adjust it to the lowest feeding position. With both types the food falls out little by little to the side before it reaches the vertical position so it doesn't really provide en even feeding. It's even more pronounced with the pellet food because it just rolls out. I also tried to time mine and it's not evenly spaced time wise either. I ended up making my own adjustments inside until it fed them correctly which involved breaking off the stops on the inner tube and taping the opening a bit.Overall I'd just recommend going with one that isn't a rotating drum. Not a particularly great design. Just get one that is actually on a timer and drops the food down at designated times.
5,Very Helpful Book,"This book is a very helpful tool in attempting to reconstruct the events surrounding Jesus' resurrection. The author doesn't claim to have the ONLY way to fit the events together, but rather that he is proposing a plausible way to view them which is faithful to the gospel accounts. Especially helpful were his maps and family trees."
3,good movie,this was an average teen movie.the same plot as all the others.teenagers talking about their boyfriends and all that junk.see this movie if you like that kinda stuff.it had some hilarious scenes
5,HIGHLY UNDERRATED!,"This was a really great film. Paul Rudd and Courtney Love's chemistry was fantastic, and the Disco Cab Driver was hilarious. This is at least destined to become a cult classic."
1,Picture a annoying sitcom made into a movie,"This movie was really terrible. If the characters in this movie were supose to irratate you to death than they did a wonderful job. IF this movie was a sitcom it would be equal to a wannabe knock off of ""Friends"". -so bad"
5,HAPPY NEW YEARZ!,"A little slow getting started, but hey, I loved this movie! Hearing Christina Ricci's accent at the begginning of the film threw me off a bit. But all the characters in 200 cigarrettes transformed into highly adorable, funky, quirky, 80's type personalities, (pause!), cool people on a mission to party like it's 1999. There! I said it! I especially liked Martha Plimpton's character. I was feeling so worried when no one was showing up for her party.This film is an engaging look at one night in NYC, (actually filmed in ""real time"" I'm assuming). It carries you along on this seemingly ill-fated New Years Eve, where everyone has got love on the brain. Primary mission: find someone special to share New Years Eve with. Who can't relate to that?! With the Millineum coming up close, this is a perfect movie to get into the spirit of things. And if you don't have that someone special in your arms that night, watch this movie. It makes perfect company."
2,kind of aimless,"I found this movie somewhat entertaining, although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun. Unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention, and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting, makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience. Nevertheless, the film is about a whole host of young people, dressed up and heading for a party (ostensibly Martha Plimpton's party), but they never quite make it there. Plimpton, someone I never really cared for, is actually rather funny in this role, and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party (and her idol, Elvis Costello). Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman are both quite funny; Courtney Love, Paul Rudd and Janeane Garofalo are also quite a trio. Overall this is light comedy; nothing special but still worth the effort."
2,200 Cigarettes Goes Up In Smoke,"This film has a great cast, but nothing else going for it besides. I was disappointed with the pointlessness and limp dialogue. I wasted eight dollars to go see a bunch of people do nothing but whine on New Year's Eve, get drunk and then get laid, waking up the next morning to discover just who they slept with while recovering from minor hangovers. I could go to a frat party and see the same thing for free. There wasn't even an hour of the reel gone, and I was terribly bored with the constant back and forth of party to party, listless characters and dragging scenes. I kept looking at their shots and martinis and frozen drinks, wishing I could have one so maybe I'd enjoy more of what I was watching. No luck, and I left the theater feeling very cheated. I advise that whoever reads this review remembers the part I said about feeling cheated, and really researches this movie before they buy it. You'll be wasting more than eight bucks!"
5,for the child of the 80's,"A fun light-harted movie. Great acting, great young cast. If you love the hight school ""dramas"" of the 80's (pretty in pink, breakfast club, etc..) you probably will enjoy this one. Just a good fun movie."
2,Not so great!,"This is the worst movie with the best actors! Man, everyone in this movie rocks! As for the movie, that's another story. The only reason I kept watching it is because I hate stopping a movie once I've started watching it. I see that a lot of people who have reviewed it liked it, but I didn't, it got no recognition...and it deserved none. I DO NOT suggest renting this movie, much less buying it!"
2,What a waste of time.......,The main drawback to 200 cigarettes is that it jumped around too much and didn't allow for character development. I enjoy Ben Affleck's acting but he can do so much better than this drivel.
3,Sweet nostalgia.......,"A bunch of young adults looking for the best new year eve party.... Hmmm.... Maybe not the most original story-line, but this movie was surprisingly fresh, funny and a little sad! Good entertainment, especially if you grew up in the late seventies/ early eighties. The soundtrack will remind you of the best years of your life. Recommended."
1,horrible movie,"This was a stupid inprofound movie. It had no plot and was absolute stupid, I really dont know what the point of this movie was. It sure was not funny, I wish I could tell you what this movie was about but I truly dont know. DO yourself a favor and dont see this"
1,so horrible I walked out of the theatre.,"I saw this movie because courtney love was in it, and I heard she did great in larry flynt. I went to see the movie, and I was greatly dissapointed. after about a half an hour, I just got up and walked out. I've never done that before @ a movie, and never have since. It was a horrible movie."
4,VERY FUNNY,"This movie has a hilarious plot, characters are vibrant and funny and it is just plain fun to watch."
2,"Good cast, bad movie!","This movie doesn't mean nothing, no real plot, not very interesting, very boring, the story go no where, well not really except lots of people get into a party for New Year Eve, what the big deal! Not the movie of the year. Bad script. But the cast is good, maybe too many well know actors are in this movie, they focus in a lot of people and don't stay long enough in one person in particular, it seem like they thought the movie will be good because of the cast but it is not, big name actors cannot save a bad movie. In the cast you have stars like Ben Afleck, Christina Ricci who act very well, Courtney Love who is very good in my point of view, you have the brother of Ben Afleck, don't remember his name he his a good actor, you have other big names that I forget. But still like I said Big Names in a movie don't make the movie Good! It was very boring!"
4,Are you not entertained?,"I think because this movie is so star-studded, people expected it to be deeply meaningful. It definitely isn't. Still, it's extremely entertaining. Courtney Love and Paul Rudd are great as two friends who are resisting becoming more. Casey Affleck is endearing as a punk who's secretly a total romantic. Janeane Garofalo is hilarious in her small role. My only complaints: Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffmann should have left the annoying fake Long Island accents alone, and the clothes are truly hideous. Of course, the latter problem isn't the fault of the movie, but of the 1980s themselves. If you're looking for pure entertainment brought to you by talented actors, look no further than 200 Cigarettes."
2,Lots 'o stars.....but,"I could see exactly how it was going to end. True to 80's style movies. But if you're as sick of the 80's revival as I am, don't watch it! Nice cameo by Elvis Costello and Janeane Garafalo is always a scream."
2,Mediocre film with a few intruguing characters,"This movie is one of the more mundane films I saw in the theater this year, which was disappointing, since the 80's were such a good, unique time. Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman prove they have no talent for recreating accents. Courtney Love is the absolute standout performance of the cast, she is a dynamic and comical actress. It's sad that its attached to a movie that is such drivel... Looking forward to Courtney's next film..."
3,"A spotlight on THE APPALOOSA, only","Matt Fletcher (Marlon Brando), is a tight-lipped loner who returns from the Civil War to his surrogate family in the border town of Ojo Prieto to settle down. When Matt's prize Appaloosa stallion (played by Cojo Rojo) is stolen by bad banditos and spirited away to Mexico, he goes after them with a vengeance. Somewhat slow, and the title character isn't in the movie all that much. However, since it's the only way to get this movie on DVD, the boxed set is recommended.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,Great price - BUT - three out of four already on DVD...,"Universal is to be commended for releasing theme collections (how about W.C. Fields Vol. 2 please!!!) but this set really lets down the Brando fanatic that already purchased three of the four films in this set already (and now have to buy those three titles AGAIN because it's the only way you can get THE APPALOOSA.) Why didn't they include BEDTIME STORY - another obscure, underated Brando title in their vault?"
1,Impossible,How can you review this one? There is no indication in your ad of what these 3 films with Brando are. How can you sell it ? I would like to know.... It's not the first time you advertise a product with no indication of what it is about. It's ridiculous. Do something about. I thought Amazon.com was a serious business. As an admirer of Brando I would be interested to know what these three movies are....
2,works great but doesn't last very long,i had this for about 2 months used it for maybe 4 times. it worked great has really good suction power better than what i have now from Profile. for no reason it stopped working. the drawback is the switch is on the side. it got rusty. its not water resistant at all. i dont think i will buy it again. cheap material plus it lasted me only 2 months.
1,Lacks performance,"Sadly disappointed this lacks suction to clean effectively. Concept is good, I'm sure there is a better option. It's just not this one."
2,A little disappointing,"I hoped it would work in my small aquariums, but it did not. I guess the water levels weren't high enough? I have no idea why it was not able to vacuum anything out, but it would've really been useful and a convenient tool had it worked since I got it so that I wouldn't have to do a full water change so often or use a siphon on such small tanks. It did work okay in my full size tanks."
4,Very Useful Resource,"I found this book really helpful, and wished that I had discovered it sooner. Besides just being a good primer on open adoption, it has very useful sections about ""Readiness for Open Adoption"", ""Choosing Each Other"", ""Getting to Know Each Other"" and parts titled ""Birth and Placement"" and ""The Relationship Grows and Changes"" - which discusses what to expect during the first year, and as the relationship grows and changes over time. It also discusses how open adoption affects the children in the families - adopted or otherwise. It also includes what to do/how to handle the situation when the Birthmom cancels the adoption plan. Overall, I thought it was a great book, as it had a good balance between the birth parents' perspective and that of the adoptive parents."
3,If you are adopting a baby put up for adoption...,"...then this book would help to answer some questions regarding continuing a relationship with the birth family. Unfortunately, if you are a fost/adopt parent - the issues pertaining to establishing on-going relationships with birth parents who have lost their parental rights (as opposed to someone who has chosen to give up their child) are not very well addressed."
1,Negative Overtone in the Beginning,My two open adoptions were so positive that when I read this book it came across as discouraging. I got the sense that the author had a negative experience with open adoption or was insecure. Sorry to say I wouldn't recommend this book.
2,Other 5 Stars give every MenScience Product 5 Stars,I tried this product based on reviews read here - it didn't work. Then I noticed all the 5 Star reviewers who reviewed other products only or predominantly reviewed MenScience products and always gave all of them 5 stars - that seems a little fishy to me - don't believe reviewers who only review one brand of product and always gives 5 stars!!!
1,VERY modest results,"Used daily for 3 months. Minimal improvement in dark circles, zero improvement in lines around eye area (I am 35 years old). I hope this is not the best product out there."
2,One Month.... No Improvement,I've used this product for one month now... I cannot see any improvement at all in the dark patches under my eyes. No change. I would not recommend this product if used solely for that purpose.
3,Not As Great As I Thought It Would Be,"So, you actually have to attach the moustache to your face by snapping it onto your nose like a bull's ring. I gave it to my friend for her birthday and she said that it hurts to wear it. Boo."
5,Fake Mustache,"This little beauty gave hours of amusement to all the family. I purchased it originally as a joke for my nephew, after he won his 6th grade class presidency, and the family all started referring to him as El Presidente. When the mustache arrived, much hilarity ensued with all the family joining in taking turns wearing the 'stache in different guises. great fun!"
3,Good item for a one-time use costume,"This isn't a very high quality product, but it worked well for my Halloween costume. It wasn't as uncomfortable as I thought it would be, and I liked the fact that I didn't have to glue it on my face. I would recommend it for a costume that won't be worn more than a couple of times."
1,Seriously...,Buy this only if you need to rob a bank. Seriously? this is horrible... I cant believe I Bought this crap.
2,"It's fun, for awhile...","Got a bunch of these mustaches for a pub crawl costume. Personally, the attachment to the nose was rather tickly for me and I couldn't keep this thing on for long. In addition, it started to fall apart fairly quickly if you tried to shape it too much. Don't really recommend it - I prefer the glue on ones."
5,Hilarious,"I really loved this product. It serves its purpose, it's cheap, and you can wear it multiple times depending on how well you ""preserve"" it. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."
3,Costume prop,"The mustache was purchased as part of a Sonny Bono costume. After some modification, it worked fine."
4,Hiking the Canyon,"This video gives a good overall view of the trails in The Grand Canyon. It is a good video for first time hikers to the Canyon with advice on equipment, weather, and length of time for the different trails with Good footage on the trails. Will help the hiker decide on which trails they might choose to try. Good Advice on day trips and overnighters. Also very informative on geology of the canyon with excellent shots of all the many faces of the terrain."
5,This book is my Bible for Research Methods,"I have used 'Research Methods in Anthropology' in designing my own Masters, PhD and subsequent research. This book goes with me wherever I am, in Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, Honduras, Puerto Rico, USVI, and other locations. I have also used it to teach graduate students both quantitative and qualitative ethnographic approaches to research. It is comprehensive, as the subtitle suggests, and accessible to every level of researcher, with interesting and often humorous examples. It is an excellent field manual, with useful chapters on basic statistics and even a table for generating random numbers, great for when you are at a field site with no electricity and the battery in your computer is dead. I am on my third copy (having battered the first two copies into oblivion in the field). 'Research methods...' is probably the hardest working book I own."
4,CLASSIC EARLY ENZ,"Split Enz were different early in thier career but even then they created great music. The inclusion of ""I Got You"" and ""History Never Repeats"" on this collection is rather odd as all the other cuts are pre 80's Enz. Somewhat strange, hypnotic melodies rule on all the other cuts which are Enz classics in thier own right. If you are expecting the Enz of the 80's this might not be your cup of tea but if you are a true fan you should enjoy these rare gems."
5,Poke Hit,"I've been playing this with my 6 year old resident Pokemaniac, and it IS good. At last, Pokemon for the Nintendo games console. He also loves that with the Transfer Pak he can play his GameBoy paks on the TV. The colour is excellent quality, and takes advantage of the bigger screen.The tournaments in the Stadium section are OK, but a bit repetitive for me....Master 6 however is entranced!The minigames are quite nice but I would rather have a Mario or other platform game for such things. You tire of them quite quickly. Still they are not too bad for a breather.The game and pak are expensive, but I think we are going to get our money's worth out of this one."
3,I give it 3 stars.........,"This game is good, but after you beat some of the stadium games, it gets frustrating and difficult. Pokemon Stadium is fun, but gets old. But I guess if you need an N64, this is an OK deal.If you are an auction person, this is good to buy, pull apart, and sell by the piece!"
4,Common Sense Investing,"I am kind of surprised and embarassed to admit it (being an accountant) but this is something that I should have figured out for myself if I really sat down and thought about it. Basically, Kwong says that the Fed has a significant influence on the economy and if you manage your investments in such a way that you put your money into the market when the Fed is supporting economic growth and vice versa your nest egg should signficantly outperform the old buy and hold investment strategy. It looks like it helps you avoid major bear markets like what we saw in 2001. As far as I can tell, this MarketBuster strategy is better than putting away my money and forgetting about it. I know a lot of people who have done that and lost a whole lot of money in their retirement accounts because they didn't use a strategy like this."
4,Makes Sense,"This approach has some merit, as Fed policies substantially influence the market. I guess the idea here is to be in the market when it's likely to go up, and out when it's likely to go down. Makes sense."
4,"""Bush is Bad"" is Great","I heartily enjoyed the CD - recorded during a couple of live performances of ""Bush is Bad"". The cast is talented, the music is tuneful, and the lyrics are clever. I especially chuckled over ""New Hope for the Fabulously Wealthy""."
5,The Motts,Finally something worth listening too. A breath of fresh air in a stifled music industry. These boys are good and are definetly going places. They have a cool website too!
2,Poetry,"A bit too formal, almost like prose.Lacking in detail, yet mildly interesting.There are other books about the war that are much better."
5,"Great graphics, good sound....","Nintendo 64 (N64 for short) is a great system for begginers becuase the controller is small and easy to work, and becuase they offer the least violent games. It's got 3-dimensional picture, you can play it on any size TV and unlike most Bame Boy games, most games have real vioces. I like the color of this consol and controller, too. N64 is the perfect thing for those boring, rainy days. Yes, I'd suggest this system."
4,Accurate & Reliable,"I have had two of these products for about 5 years. They are accurate and reliable. I have only minor criticism; the battery compartment of the indoor unit is difficult to open. One reviewer wished for a clock; it has one, although I wish it didn't. Why should a thermometer have a clock and an alarm?? One reviewer complained about low temperature operation; specs say it will read as low as 14 degrees and manual says the outside unit should have lithium batteries (which function at low temperatures). My product will monitor more than one outside transmitter; mine does two. I am very pleased with my products."
1,thermometer doesnt read temperature,"this thermometer is great if u live in the tropics,. anything below 20 degrees f it just quits and is all blurry. p.o.s. currently it is minus 4 degrees, stupid thermometer says ---- if only it was close to the temp. sorry i paid for it and never again"
1,Typewriter was Defective upon Receipt,"I ordered this typewriter for my mother, who is computer phobic, but she has gladly taken up the computer after this nightmare. The typewriter was completely defective--it didn't type the letters that were pressed (despite zeroing the daisy wheel), it kept resetting the margins as if possessed, the spacing of letters was inconsistent...It was junk. What is worse is that SmithCorona technical help never returned my calls and all the service centers I called had their phone numbers disconnected. Fortunately, the company accepted my return for a full refund. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!"
4,Great candy making starter book,"I LOVE candy and decided I'd like to make some of my own, instead of shelling out $20 per pound. This book is a terrific starter book. It has pictures of all the candy so you can see if yours turns out looking the same. It gives great tips and starter information for the beginner. There are all kinds of recipes for chocolates, caramels, hard candies, soft candies, caramel corn, etc. The book even has recipes for making your own marshmallows and sweetened milk, in case you don't have any. I am really enjoying this book alot and may even buy another copy for a gift."
2,Not really candy,"I wasn't impressed with this book and here is why. The layout was boring, the directions were scanty; offered in the front of the book only. There wasn't much of an introduction at all and there was no ending. The recipes offered covered fudge, toffee, cereal snacks, but most of these were variations of one common recipe: ex- basic chocolate fudge, then choc-mint fudge, cho-coffee fudge..this sort of thing. The maple fudge recipe has no maple in it. Some of the recipes were not even what I would classify as candy since they were made from cooking corn syrup and cereal together. There was way too much emphasis on using sweetened condensed milk, confectioners sugar,and chocolate coatings. The title was inaccurate. It should of been called ""quick and easy sweets"". There is not much about real candy making methods in this book at all.I gave this book 2 stars because the photos were good (the identification charts were not) and for the occasional recipe that beckoned. I don't recommend."
4,An Okay Book,"I didn't get the type of information I was looking for in this book, but I will not say that others won't. You will learn something if you are a novice to candy making."
5,Beautiful Knife,"What can I say. It'is a Buck, it's, and the handle is beautiful - actually it so beautiful that you will want to display it instead of use it. I should mark it down a star for the sheath which is a PITA ""for me anyway"" to use. Give me an old style sheath where there is a leather flap that folds over the top and snaps down. I imagine someones snap came undone and they lost their knife. This thing almost takes two hands to wrap a strap around the handle and the snap it back onto itself."
4,"Great knife, so-so sheath","Love the knife. Beautiful wood handle and brass pommel. When pulling it out of the sheath however, you risk dragging the edge across one of the metal snap rivets. The snap is a tight fit by the way, which would be annoying, if not maddening, in an emergency. I might experiment with a velcro replacement."
4,"Great knife, not a very practical sheath","I saw a man wearing one of these and thought it was so beautiful that I would like to have one. The knife is perfect. It is very sharp, and the design is beautiful. It's small, especially compared to the next size up that Buck sells. I ordered both, but sent the larger one back, because it felt more like a weapon to me, and that is not what I was looking for. The sheath though is not very practical. It's well made, but has a big snap on the side that's not easily re-snapped when you put it back. I had a leathersmith make me a sheath that the knife simply tucks in to about half way up the handle. No stupid snap, it won't fall out, and is much more attractive. I give it a 4 star rating only because I feel Buck did not think out the sheath. The knife is a 5 star in my book."
1,advertised length 4-5/8,"This product ad said to be 4-5/8 , shipped 3-7/8 and received over all length 7-3/4""What happened ??? Beauty though...Would like 4-5/8"
5,I heart brezel,"Wow, massive pop attack! You like pop, you like Europeans and keyboards? This is the album for ya. Brezel and Franciose mix up some uber-cool tracks, my favorites being ""Wir Tanzen in 4-Eck"" (means,""we dance in four corners""), ""Nationale 7"". and ""L'Amour a Toi"" (french: ""love between three (of us)"". The new release has cool new stuff, but my favorites were on the original as well. Japanese, turkish, french, english and german listeners will get the lyrics, but anyone can rock out with em. Cool cartoon-y album art as well."
4,Dino Nostalgia From The Capitol Days,"Collecting Dino from back in the Jerry days (50s). Have this timelesschristmas songs from first ""A Winter Romance"" and so ""Holliday Cheer"" LPs.This is a well done RR BUT it's NOT the cover you see pictured on theproduct In my case it was o.k. as I dont have this one ever butit's very inportant for a collector that what you see is what you got.Roland"
3,Amazingly average book,"With enough books chronicling the life and works of Steven Spielberg, this brief and sketchy tome hardly qualifies as one of the best. But I'm a hardcore Spielberg fan and have almost all the books written about him. Regardless, this is simply to fill a niggling itch, not necessarily for a good read. If you're looking for quality and sincere Spielberg books, Neil Sinyard and Ian Freer's excellent bios are great reading."
1,Superficial at best,"If you know nothing at all about Steven Spielberg, this book might be a good summary of his career. But if you are looking for personal insights, new depth or detailed film analysis, invest your book-buying money elsewhere. I was also put off by the fairly frequent denigrating remarks about various actors, screen writers and directors many of whom have careers that would seem worthy of some degree of respect."
5,I was more than overjoyed to watch the videos.,The video series comes with one of the easier follow along books that I have seen. The book can be used by itself but I strongly recommend to watch the tape. I have shown the video and book to my native speaking Mandarin teacher and she was very impressed as well. The main thing is that I have also shown the video to people who considered Chinese too difficult to learn. After viewing the video they had a totally different viewpoint. Really is very possible to learn to converse in Mandarin in a relatively short period of time. To me Mandarin is one of the most beautiful languages there is. That alone is reason enough to learn it and reason enough for any school to teach it. I think any school that teaches Mandarin should recommend and expose their students to this wonderful supplementary video learning material. I really can't imagine that anyone would be disappointed with these tapes. They really make learning fun!!
4,the master at twilight,"Late in his career the greatest country artist of them all is playing to please himself, which means no-nonsense, stripped-down honkytonk, including, here, a fair dose of songs associated with Lefty and two of the three major Hanks. There are no revelations here, just real country music of the sort that, as far as I'm concerned, is welcome anywhere, anytime. Of the three originals, ""Runaway Mama"" informs you, in case you were wondering, what Jimmie Rodgers would sound like if he were recording today. He'd be proud to have written the song, too."
5,alright merle et al,"Merle goes back to his early musical influences and gives us something more than the originals could - there is more sophistication, artistry and just plain darn good music here than you can find in any hour of c/w music on popular media. this is great stuff, especially if you apprerciate the history of this kind of music. don't let this slip by - - - one thing I do miss is Merle's stand out lead guitar, but having one of his hero's lead guitarist filling that role makes the album that much more interesting - and after all, there is no shortage of classic [and current and future] Merle Haggard on this album."
5,A Superb Tribute to the Stars of the Golden Age of C&W,"This is Merle's greatest work in 15 years. This work feature 5 songs made famous by the late great immortal Lefty Frizzell, 2 hits first recorded by the equally late great immortal Hank Williams, an 2 songs from the repetoire of the great and still living immortal Hank Thompson. The album is much enhanced by the addition of the newest band member Mr. Norm Stephens, Who played for both Frizzell and Thompson. The album also contains 3 songs composed by Merle. A great work, and an enjoyable listening experience."
3,A nice book with a few flaws,"The book seems to assume you don't know linux that well. I would prefer it assumed you did. For people who don't know Linux why start with a book about Java in the Linux environment? Why not just learn about using java in Mac OS or Windoze? There is much of java that is not covered, instead you are referred to a more thourough book on java. I didn't want a chapter on how to use vi. Instead I wished that it got to the meat of java sooner and gave more information about java instead of referring me always to another book. I seem to be at odds with the fellow who said it was too much java and not enough Linux."
3,struggling to get this working on a mac...,Frustrating that I can't hook this up to my iMac. We first got a Sony laptop- but couldn't edit our discs on that. More than a year later- we got an iMac (which we love)- wish the Sony camera would connect via USB to the iMac. the imac doesn't support miniDVD. Any suggestions (besides get a Canon)?Otherwise- the camera is ergonomic and works well - so long as you don't intend to edit on an iMac.
4,Pass It Up if You're Narrow Minded,"This book was slow in the beginning, but once it picked up I was able to understand why the reader has to go through so much ""foundation."" The book may be unrealistic to the average person but it was entertaining and gave great views on getting whatever it is ""you"" want."
5,Great Album!,"Just picked this LP up in mint condition at a record shop in Troy NY for $2. Like many of the other reviewers, this is a smooth jazz/fusion classic with catchy tunes that was the forerunner to the sound of smooth jazz through the 80's and 90's. I especially like ""End Of Romanticism"" for the harder fusion sound. Great musicianship."
5,Starting Over by Robin Pilcher,"Excellent read. Being a fan of Rosamunde Pilcher, I expected nothing less than excellent works from her son. Uses his individual style, of course. The characters are wonderful and many; there's history about the areas his characters are involved in; it doesn't take long to keep everyone straight as the story unfolds. I continue to look forward to more books from this author. I believe he's truly ""off and running"" as a writer."
1,Trite Waste of Time,"Robin Pilcher's first book, ""An Ocean Apart"" was one of the best books I had read in a long time. I was glad to find this one. What a waste! Badly written. Pilcher's character's have all been in other books. Some of the scenarios are laughable. The love interest knocking on Liz' door at a hotel pretending to be a bellboy and then leaning up against the doorframe when she opens it is written to melt our hearts but appears sophmoric. The book is overall very wholesome until you get towards the end when Will encourages Liz to use the ""F"" word to get out her frustrations, so she does to a point of ridiculousness. Then, she is encouraged by a woman they meet to have sex with Will because it brings healing and SHE KNOWS because she cheated on her husband and now things are wonderful. A silly book that had potential, but Pilcher tries too hard and needs to be more original."
2,Give me a break!,"I agree with the writer of the review ""Who wrote the ending?"" Having read 99% of Rosamunde Pilcher's books, I found Robin's story similar to some of her novelettes;i.e., a decent read...until the end. The Liz who decides she may attempt a reconciliation with a not well-drawn character of an ex-husband for the sake of a mature 18-yr old son was not the Liz who left Spain! Very irritating ending; left me with the feeling ""Why did I waste my time reading this book""."
3,Starting Over,"Slow start, will try again but certainly not engaging immediately. Will update as I try again. Usually enjoy the English story tellers."
2,mixed bag,"Cameron Carpenter can clearly play anything. His level of technical mastery is unquestionable. However, I think the level of artistic refinement is not on the same par. A few pieces here and there are interesting, but after the first listen I found the whole thing boring. Once I got past the ""wow, this guy's fingers and feet can really move!"" the music felt rather empty; actually, more soulless than anything.For an electronic instrument, the organ sounds only ok."
4,"Good value, great product","I got a Palm IIIc and this case six months ago. It's made of black leather and has ""Palm IIIc"" embossed on the bottom corner and looks very classy! I carry it in my purse everyday and it does its job - so far it has been very durable, no seams have come off and the velcro stays put. I do have to take one star away in the review because the built-in stylus holder is a bit loose that I have to keep the stylus in the Palm unit. Other than that, it looks good and the price is right."
2,Doesn't fit the Palm IIIc,I am returning this case it does not fit the Palm IIIC. the edges of the palm stick out and I want more protection than that.
3,Not easy to use on pumpkins,"Didn't work for me when trying to carve a pumpkin. Perhaps just that I wasn't that experienced with it. But, it was difficult to move it around to complete the design."
3,dremel rotary tool carving kit,Excellent product. Works very effectively for carving wood in conjunction with a Dremel rotary tool. The interior plate of the box used to hold the bits is very flimsy.
5,nice tool,We purchased an engraving attachment for the dremmel which worked great but we wanted more engraving bits. We didn't need all of the assorted items but the kit packaging was financially attractive. We are completely satisfied with the product and I'm sure we will eventually use all of the bits.
3,Probably my mistake,"The product is probably worth 5 stars but I thought I was buying the entire engraving tool when it said engraving tool kit. Instead, it was just the bits and tools that go with an engraver. I guess engraving kit doesn't mean it includes everything. It was probably my mistake but I feel it could have been worded better."
3,Dremel rotary tool tips,I have a Dremel engraver which comes with one tip. I ordered these thinking they would all fit the engraver since everything is Dremel but only half of the tips fit. The base of the other half is too narrow and it is impossible to tighten them tightly enough operate.
2,What?,"Was sold these as part of a packet with an engraver, but, they don't work with an engraver - they require a drill type unit. They may be good, or they may not be, I wouldn't know. Make sure the accessories you order match the tool ordered ... ads can be confusing."
3,dremel 689,"the tool I was using is not as fast as I want. I've decided to go with the ultra high speed for woodcarving, but most of the dremel tools are really good."
2,WTF?,"I don't know why Amazon thinks it would be a good idea for me to review a product I have not purchased from them or from anybody else. I do own a dremel, but there is no way they could know that. Based on the picture and other dremel sets I do own, I'd say that it is 11 common tools in an oversized box. The box will not fit in a tool box, but you will want to keep it because other wise you will never find those stupid little pieces again. Not when you need them anyway.Take that for what it's worth."
1,Miss leading advertisement.,"I was miss lead by this company. The bits they show you in the picture give you the impression that they are a pretty good size. In fact these bits are so small, they could only be used best if you are a microscopic person. I can only recommend these bits if your doing some finish work, and intend to do really fine detail. I mean really small detail. The bits are not much bigger then a Nat fly.Please dont be fooled. Don't buy from this company. But your choice. Buyer be ware!neil."
5,Good value!,"I purchased this tool assortment and my Dremel rotary tool at the same time. I love both of them. I'm an artist and have recently taken up making small animal sculptures. The size of the tools in this carving and engraving kit are perfect. I do have one problem with the set. It is advertised as having ""two diamond tips"" and I have not found any way to tell which ones those two might be."
4,A good set of bits for engraving,"I purchased this for my wife when she got a Dremel for Christmas. One of the bits in the package was the one recommended by a video that I saw on YouTube for glass engraving, so I figured that for ~$10 it was a good deal, and maybe there would be some other bits that would end up being good as well. Apparently, diamond tipped/headed bits are preferred for glass work.After receiving the bits and giving them a try, the one that was recommended worked great, but made a very thin engraving line. We started experimenting with the other bits, and the biggest one in the set ended up being the best one for the style that she was going for. It's a nice clean textured line, but much thicker. This set turned out to be a good investment even if she's really only using one bit."
5,dremel carving tools,"Bought these to go with my dremel se,t because I had started doing wood carving's, bowls, pens, plates, vases, and just wanted to add some extra ""flair"" or ""zing"" to the item/product. WORKS GREAT, makes my items look like ONE OF A KIND PIECES. GOOD buy."
5,poop and pee consumer,Boy do I love poop mixed with pee they take me on a musical journey into wondrous realms of enchantment and emotion. I highly recommend poop mixed with pee for a quiet night with some wine by the fireplace with your significant other.
3,A worthy effort,"I saw a lot of this footage presented as a documentary in the UK in the late 90s and thought I had rediscovered it with this release but found that very different stories can be narrated the same base information. The audience for this Nova documentary has been carefully gauged and I think it does an adequate job for a senior high bio class. What I saw back in the 90s was a very different story, whether it was the alternative voice-over, the more extensive use of subtitles or the immediacy of the story in the 90s the 'original' was a riveting experience that is simply not captured in this piece. This is especially true of the tensions between the 'Internationals' who had a golden opportunity to extract as much information as possible from the outbreak and the local doctors who saw no reason to invest any time into an empirical approach when their compatriots were struck down before them."
1,Doesn't work for me.,"I have Tinea versicolor, and after trying almost every so called remedy and treatment out there i came across ZNP bar. I used it for a month and ended up throwing it away later. I my Tinea Versicolor actually got worse!"
1,bad condition,"The 3 disc set had scratches, all the DVDs kept skipping through scenes on their own and I was not able to enjoy it comfortably. There are many parts to this movie that I missed and I'm very disappointed!"
5,Another set with bad packaging :(,"This DVD has great matches, you'll learning something if you dont know much about Kane.-------------------------------This is a BUY--------------A must for any Kane fan.-------------I'm not even going to bother with the match list; seeing how a bunch of users already posted them up and gave they're thoughts, Impressions and ratings on them."
4,good but not great,"I am a huge kane fan and am glad he finally has a dvd out. The dvd is good but not great, there could have been a lot better matches in it like some of his hardcore title matches or the TLC match where he won the tag titles all by himself and it should have definatly have the match against HHH where he lost his mask. Also it had some good bonus features but could have better ones. The dvd has clips where he tombstones Linda McMahon but it should have the actual footage from raw, the same thing goes for when he chokeslammed bischoff off the stage and ruined Edge's and Lita's wedding and tombstoned the preist. Hopfully WWE will come out with another kane dvd that can have better stuff but still if you are a big kane fan as I am this dvd is worth getting, the best bet would to be to ask for it as a bday gift or see if you can snag a copy cheap on ebay."
4,A View Into a Forgotten Corner of The World,"An interesting narrative of the author's travels through Newfoundland and Labrador- a little known corner of North America. An intriguing insight to the fall of a society when the natural resources - i.e., the Cod - disappeared."
4,Great info for the novice beekeeper.,Gives the new beekeeper valuable insight to the life-cycle of the honeybee. Interesting enough for even those not keeping bees. The whole family will enjoy the documentary. Great video for a science or biology class.
5,Detailed-interesting,"I am a teacher and used this in one of my Biology classes when we were discussing animal behavior.It was very detailed and gave many interesting facts. I usually have my students answer questions while watching the video, but this included so much information I did not know where to start asking questions. I let them just sit and enjoy it.!!!"
4,The Bees Knees!!,"As a future bee keeper I am trying to learn all I can about the little wonders, this DVD is all it is advertised to be. I also wanted it to, hopefully, intice my grandsons into this bee stuff with me."
5,CINDERELLA COSTUME,"I HAVE BOUGHT OTHER CINDERELLA'S COSTUMES IN THE PAST FOR MY GRANDAUGHTERS, BUT THIS ONE THAT I RECENTLY BOUGHT FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL, SHE WORE IT AT DISNEY WORLD ALL OVER THE MAGIC KINGDOM AND DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE IT OFF, IT MUST BE VERY COMFORTABLE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T COMPLAIN AT ALL, SHE LOOKED AND FELT AS A REAL CINDERELLAPRINCESS."
4,Adores it,I purcased this dress for my daughters 4th birthday and she totally adores it. She loves to play dress up and the is by far her favorite now. Quality is very nice and not too tight around the arms as many dress up style dresses are. Love it!
3,Cinderella dress.,This dressup dress is great. But the size was way too big. The Snow White dress was the same size and fine. I sent the required email to get a return label about 5 days ago and have yet to hear from anyone. Since it is obviously way too big (maybe mismarked) I don't think I should have to pay a 15% restocking fee plus postage. I am very disappointed in this transaction. The dress however is very nice.
4,Good costume.,I am satisfied with the quality of the costume for the price. Would definitely recommend it for the princesses. A good buy.
5,nice costume,"This costume came in time for Halloween which was the bare minimum requirement, but it is also very lovely, well made, and sturdy. It is worth exactly what we paid for it. My daughter will wear this all year for dress up. it's perfect for log term wear."
5,Simply Beautiful :),"I am so very very...happy...I chose this dress....did I say ""very"" lol! The design and material is even prettier than the picture. The castle design at the bottom of the dress with Cinderella & her prince is really beautiful and the petticoat is not made of itchy material like some others I have seen.. The size seems to be true to the 3T I chose for my grand-daughter for her birthday, ..She is ""petite"" and short & be 3 years old when she gets this dress..I wanted the dress to fit her for awhile so it may be a just a little big but I figure it will fit her for a few years and it zips in the back which will help keep the dress up. For the lenght I ordered the cinderella shoes from K-Mart with the little heel and it should be perfect. The only negative may be that it says you cannot wash or dry clean...just spot clean which with children it's not the best. But still, all in all between the dress and the on time free shipment, I couldn't be happier!"
3,Not as pretty as the picture,"We were not thrilled with this purchase. It ran big so the size we bought does not fit our daughter. She is a tall 3 who usually wears 4/5. We ordered a 4-6x in this product. This dress felt cheaply made. Due to the cost of returning it and resocking it, we kept in and our daughter will grow into in next year."
5,loved it!,"Purchased one for my daughter (4 y.o) (3T-4T) it was a bit wide under the arms, but still looks great, she loves it!"
5,Adorable Cinderella dress,"I bought this for my grand daughter's birthday. It is very well made and I know she will love it when she sees it. I took the advice of others and bought the underskirt to make it puff out a little more. The price was reasonable, too."
3,sparkly and cute,"It met all the requirements of my little granddaughter, but the quality wasn't there. She'll enjoy it, but I was disappointed in the quality for the price of the dress."
2,Poor quality zipper,"No doubt that it is a pretty dress, but the zipper broke the first time I put my daughter into it. I would expect that an expensive dress would have a better zipper."
3,Storybook Cinderella Prestige Costume,"i bought this Cinderella Prestige Costume for my 3 years old Grand daughter, she likes it so much, but it's a little too big for her due to her small frame. Overall it's a good buy...Winnsie KwaSingapore"
2,Cinderella costume,I returned this because I did not feel the quality was commensurate with the price. Target had the dress and all accessories including shoes for less money. Quality was as good or better than this one.
5,A Quality Costume,"Compared to other Cinderella costumes, this is a quality piece. Most costumes are flimsy, but you will find this one of heavier material and ""gown-like"", much like you'd see in a flower girl dress. There are beautiful, but subtle, pictures of the castle and the Prince and Cinderella in the fabric at the bottom of the dress that offers a very classy look. My daughter just loves it. Well worth the money!"
5,Perfect!!!,This costume is worth every penny! My daughter loves it!! She is 4 years old and it is her favorite thing to wear! The details on this costume is amazing. Thanks again!!
3,There are better alternatives.,"My boyfriend and I have tried several glutamine powders, and we agree that this one has a nasty bitter taste when mixed in water. Getting it to dissolve is also a challenge. I've found combining it with a protein shake in a blender works best both to hide the taste and to get it mixed. In short, there are other glutamine powders at good prices to choose from so I will go elsewhere from now on."
3,i dont know if you're suppossed to feel it working,"I really cant review this product because i dont know if you're suppossed to feel it working. I lift weights and heard that glutamine is really good for your muscles but i havent noticed any difference after taking it for 2 months straight. It looks, smells, and tastes exactly like flour. The only good thing is that this is about a years supply of glutamine in this bottle"
5,The Best!,"I've been using this particular brand for years, and it's awesome! I have no complaints. I don't even bother mixing it. Just a spoonful of it and some water, and I'm set! ;)"
3,No effect?,"I started taking this daily about a month ago. I haven't notice anything different. Perhaps I'm less sore, but I can't really tell. At least I don't have an upset stomach from it. On a positive note, the power mixes very well with protein shakes."
5,unbelievable,"Wow, this powder is like silk, yet it doesn't fly away, but mixes instantly with no taste. One only needs a rounded teaspoon per day, so it will last a long time."
2,Not worth supplementing!,"I decided to try glutamine because of all the articles of people swearing by it and for $10, I figured what the hell! People claim that glutamine helps you recover faster and get less sore quicker and while I do know that's true but, you get the same benefits from your protein powders. I noticed that I got less sore just as fast with supplemental glutamine than I did with just taking my recovery drink and protein powders, there was no difference. So while I know for a fact that glutamine is an important amino acid needed for muscle recovery; if you're taking a protein powder though you don't need to supplement at all! I'm just glad I paid for the small bottle to test, will not be buying a supplement that I don't need."
4,Front Mission 3,The game got to me very fast in under 2 weeks in very good condition. I have played threw the game with no problems so far. All the movies work and so does the audio and game play. It is great to be able to play such an old PS one game with no problems.
3,Is Front Mission 3 for you???,"Front Mission 3 - Circa 2000GOOD:- A nice change of theme from the usual swords and sorcery that most strategy games use- Customizable mechsBAD:- Graphics might looked dated, to today video game players- Gameplay can be difficult and slow- Story is overly complex but can be a little on the dry sideIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A Sci-fi strategy set in the pacific rim of a near future earth- Gameplay can be slow and difficult- No voice-overs so lots of reading- Customizable mechsGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Armored Core- Final Fantasy TacticsADDITIONAL NOTES:- This first 2 games where on Super Nintendo"
5,Front Mission 3 review,"I have this game since 4 years and I continue to play. It's a good game, the graphics and the soundrack are good, the personages are realists and it's good that we have the choice between two stories. The only negative fact: Alisa die in the end of the Emma scenario."
5,Why is this game so dang expensive!!??,"I actually played the demo on the Squaresoft 2000 Collector's CD vol. 3 I got with Vagrant Story when I bought it way back, but was this game actually $130 when it first came out? Heck, FFXI is $100 and it's brand new for the PS2. The lowest price for this game on amazon is $50. That's crazy talk! It's only a PS One game, and games for the PS usually ran at most $60 when they were new. Is there something extra that comes with this game, like a 24K gold ring or something? My goodness!"
3,Great until about mission 5681...,"No there arent really 5681 missions, there's 85. 85 painful and repetative missions. When I first started playing the game, I loved it. The graphics, the sound, story, blah blah blah were great, right up there with Tactics. My favorite part about the game was the ability to completely customize your characters to be whatever you wanted them to be. I went and told my friends how great a game it was, having so many secrets, play hours, abilities, etc. Then at about mission 5681 it was like watching home videos over..and over..and over..and over. You get the picture. All of the battles are almost exactly the same, and you do the same things eighty...five...times. So I stopped playing it. I dont mean to trash the game, but this is truly what its like. This is just my opinion though. If you love mechs and the stuff, this game is awesome and totally awe-inspiring. So, if you absolutely love mechs, get it. If yer only so-so like me, be prepared."
5,Wonderful collection of the best of the Kenny Rogers & The First Edition.,"It is nice to have a great collection of just Kenny Rogers and First Edition. Normally collections of Kenny's music weeds in a few First Edition Tracks With the rest of his later hits. This collection just focuses in on the First Edition. I found this collection to be a wonderful overview of Kenny Rogers and the First Edition in one affordable disc. I would recommend this collection to anyone looking of best of the first edition. Great Price, Great Music = Great Deal in my book."
5,Nice CD-collection;-),Great CD!!...and one of the greatest songs are placed on this cd!...so thanx!!...i am very satisfied over this cd!...Cheerz from Bina;O)*nov 26th 2007*
4,10 great songs.,"""Kenny Rogers"" is one of the greats from the classic country era. This is half the collection ""20 Greatest Hits"" is, but for the price it's good. Plus it still has most of his best songs. Included here is ""She Believes In Me"", ""Lady"", ""Coward Of The County"", and his biggest hit ""The Gambler"". It also has a few nice duets. Overall it's a nice simple collection for the casual fan. If you need more than this, pick up one of his other fifteen best of's."
1,Might fool a 8 year old..,"Ink in pen had dried up before it arrived and was impossible to even perform the trick.Also, instead of them pulling the bill,they try to grab the pen instead."
5,Love is a Beautiful Thing,"My review of this book comes from a different perspective because I was the designer. I found this book to be beautifully written, and with each page that I designed, I would stop and read, and be touched by the sentiment. I think this is a wonderful book to have, in that it's perfect to thumb through when you need a pick me up, or when you're nostalgic about your relationship. It includes sentiment that everyone who has ever loved can relate to. I've designed many books, and this, by far, is my favorite to pick up time and time again."
4,Logical successor to Hendrix and Vaughan,"Though I personally liked the rock direction he was going in on his previous album, ""That's What I Am"", and was hoping for a logical progression on this release, the sudden 180-degree turn back to the blues is a refreshing and welcome one. And he was eventually going to come around to this anyway.This one is a statement. Eric Gales is staking his claim on the blues scene, and he's setting up shop. Let's hope he's around for a long time. Bluesmen are a dying breed. This world needs an artist like Eric Gales not only to keep the blues alive, but to breathe new life into it and give it momentum in the 21st century.Buy his CD's so he won't have to take a mundane job and stop making great music for us."
3,Good by anybody elses standards but...........,"Not as good by ""Eric Gales"" standards. If you're new to Eric's music his previous CD""That's What I Am"" puts this to shame. As well as his phenomenal work with hisbrother on the two ""Eric Gales Band"" CD's. The song writing is not as strong here.If you have all of Eric's work and are missing this one it's still worth getting. It justdoesn't measure up to his previous stuff."
3,Eric Gales is a great guitar player...,"but the song writing is no where near as great as on ""That's What I Am""! The only songs that even come close are ""CrystalVision"" and That's how it is. Now, I'm no pro critic but ""Thats What I Am"" was one of the freshest things I had ever heard and seeing him ""live"" was even better(where's the tour dates)but ""CrystalVision"" was a little disappointing."
3,"This product works fine, just like other massage ...","This product works fine, just like other massage oils. However, I don't really like the smell. I'm too used to lavender oil smell. Maybe others will find it pleasant."
4,I used it mainly as an after-shower moisturizer ...,"I used it mainly as an after-shower moisturizer for my legs, which are usually dry. It was very good for that -- it left my legs feeling smooth and I couldn't see the dry skin. I had to rub it in quite a bit, so that I didn't deposit oil on any of my clothes, but if I did that, it'd disappear into my skin. I found my legs still didn't look so dry even at the end of the day. It does have a strong citrus scent, though. I liked the citrus smell, but others might not."
5,Nothing Better!,This is the best allover moisturizer/oil I have ever used! I have long curly dry hair and when I get out of the shower I use it head (yes on my hair) to toe. It makes your skin and hair very soft. The scent is subtle and mysterious. My husband loves the scent as much as I do!
4,"Great scent, not feminine at all so my ...","Great scent, not feminine at all so my husband didn't mind giving me a massage with it. It had a very spicy, rustic scent and was just right for soothing tired muscles after a hard day's work. Also great for right after the bath. I enjoyed this product."
3,Can you feel the beat of paula???,"For a couple of seasons Paula was really big both sides of the Atlantic...She may not have been the qualities to be called a proper singer, yet she was really determined to make it and her true enjoying the dancefloor and performances got her several top 10's and some 5 # 1 hits...maybe one would not expect this result???STRAIGHT UP is the one that started it all, great vibe, great black n white video...in no time was on top of the charts.FOREVER YOUR GIRL boasts a nice sax solo and COLD-HEARTED was sexy and hot.OPPOSITES ATTRACT reached # 1 mainly thanks to a catchy animated video.And then you have THE summer 1991 # 1 hit ballad RUSH, RUSH (remember how cute Keanu Reeves was in that video??? POW!)The rest is mainly uncharted singles and a megamix filler i would have done gladly without...But KNOCKED OUT and IF I WERE YOUR GIRL rise amongst them.A worth-buying package, if only to relieve your '90's parties..."
3,GOOD COLLECTION,IF YOUR A PAULA ABDUL FAN THIS IS A MUST. SOME SONGS HERE THATI'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE. GOOD COLLECTION OF HER 'BEST' SONGS...
3,STEP SISTER,"PAULA ABDUL-GREATEST HITS: Blessed with a choreographer's eye and sultry good looks, perfect plastic pop princess PAULA ABDUL was a video juggernaut in the the MTV age. ABDUL's perky brand of dance pop couldn't mask a small voice, but ultra slick production and an irresistible beat, the savior of many a sound bite diva then and now, netted her an impressive six number one singles during the course of a three album career. STRAIGHT UP's jittery pop-and-lock groove, the callous diss of COLD HEARTED, and urban ""everything but the kitchen sink"" stomper VIBEOLOGY were all slinky soundscapes slathered in synthetic soul. A couple of ballad biggies break up the hyper pace on GREATEST HITS, along with the clunky club cut MEGAMIX MEDLEY, which sinks under its own weight. ABDUL would by now be a mere footnote in musical annals, were it not for another more recent taste making boob-tube phenom...namely a certain GONG SHOW update that made her a superstar all over again.RATING: THREE PUMPS"
4,good piece of late 80s/early 90s culture,"This is a very good collection of Paula's radio hits that I remember from the late 80s and early 90s. Paula was a good singer and dancer and the music is fun. It makes a person want to grove to it and dance. An enjoyable pop/dance music listening experience. Paula was better as her own artist rather than as Simon Cowell's sidekick on TV. Oh well, better to be a has-been than a never-was. Paula's music was a good contribution to the radio at the time, and this CD is a good contribution to a music fan's collection."
4,Paula Abdul - Greatest Hits,This CD had all the great songs by Apula Abdul. The CD also included a dance mix that gave a sample of all the songs on the CD rolled into one song on the CD as well which I thought was a great idea. I hope that other R & B artists would do the same thing with their songs as well: have a greatest hits album & a dance mix sampling all the songs on the CD a bonus.
4,Almost there!,"Wow, a Paula Abdul compilation. Who would've thought.It's been years I haven't heard her songs and i'm glad i did recently. It brought back good memories and times of innocence.I have to agree though that the selection on this compilation could've been better. In my opinion, the out of print japanese The Greatest compilation has a better selection of songs but that is if you're lucky to find it now AND if you are willing to spend about $50 for it now.Otherwise stick to this one as it comes close to be a perfect compilation for Ms. Abdul.I think if she would've continued with her music career she could've had a good one. I mean I'd take her over the Britneys and Ashleys of this time. Hey, it's never too late! Paula may surprise us one day ;)"
5,THE REAL HITS OF PAULA ABDUL,"HERE WE HAVE THE REAL HITS OF PAULA ON THE LENGHT AND MIX THAT YOU'VE HEARD THEM ON THE RADIO IN THE LATE 80'S,REMASTERED SOUND,THE PAULA ABDUL CD."
5,Paula Abdul Rocks!!,Before I got this cd I will admit I had never heard Paula sing before. This is my first season of watching American Idol and I am hooked. Paula And Simon so go together. Now this is my favorite. Forget all the yo yo yo who's your daddy crap. This stuff is much better. I actually looked up the words for the rap in the midle of Cold Hearted. That is my favorite song. Next to Straight Up. I find myself singing that alot. Well anywho it just goes to show that Paula Abdul rocks! And I am not Cheryl. I am her grand daughter Caitlyn.
3,Dated Greatest Hits ? Well they did play on Radio.....,"This is the greatest hits (LOL) collection from a GRADE B artist. ABDUL remained popular for the blink of an eye during the end of a decade where neon clothing became a fashion trend. All the tracks on this release sound dated. You will quickly realize that this lady was more media darling (via video) than gifted vocalist/artist. ""Straight up"" ABDUL is nothing more than ""forever your girl"" with a tacky collection of CASIO PROGRAMMED hits ~! Guess that makes her the ""Britney"" of the 80s !"
2,The Britney Spears of the '80s,"Paula was the Britney Spears of the '80s- an over-hyped creator of mindless and meaningless bubblegum pop. But at least Britney is pretty, while Paula's eyes pop out of her brainless head. Buy Whitney Houston or Tina Turner instead because they are the TRUE QUEENS OF MUSIC."
4,Stimulating prog-rock - a bit special,"Came across SDT only recently and The Machine That Cried is already in my top 10. Didn't know about their Scottish roots, or reformation after 20 years and am usually dubious about buying live, especially prog-rock. But this is exceptional - tight, fine sound and really stimulating prog-rock, with a rockier feel than Machine. The stand-out tracks are the title track and Circus but they are all strong and stimulating. This is real prog-rock with the fine and sometimes eery violin of Grahame Smith lifting fine tracks to something else, counterpoint to the Chris Adams composition. We like prog-rock because it brings something else to the party - since buying this I'm seeking out the rest of the STD catalogue"
2,The Snap Broke Within 2 Weeks,"I bought 2 of these - 1 for me and 1 for a friend. The snap just broke off the strap piece. It was some cheap VERY thin metal (aluminum foil-like) used to secure the snap piece to the strap. I called my friend and he said his broke after just a couple of days. I like it, but will take it into a luggage repair place to see if they can put on a REAL snap! If not, I'll return it and try to find a nice leather one with an actual belt clip."
2,Doesn't worth it,"I bought this case on December (2000) based on the reviews here. I was happy for 4 months until the snap-on button got broken. Guess what? Palm doesn't have warranty or support for this product. If you call for support they send you to the Palm store if you call and complain in the store they send you to support. The only products that Palm supports handle are palm devices. There is no way to repair the snap-on button... this is sad. Your best bet... go with Targus, 3 year or lifetime warranty cases. I just ordered a Targus Slipcase (CH100)."
2,Poor design for Palm IIIc,"To use this product, you have to remove the plastic hard cover from your Palm IIIc organizer. The leather case fastens with a snap so you could attach it to a belt,purse,or brief case, etc. But, it flops around and is not easily accessed for quick use. I wanted a product similar. And, I sure wish I could design my own. I want a clip on leather case - (secure fit like ones used for pagers). I want to be able to open the leather case easily, then, raise the plastic cover and use the orangizer. It would also be nice to have a place to store an extra stylus and credit cards or name cards. Thank you. I will keep searching."
1,this is a bad product,"i used this pathetic ecuse for a produc, had it hanging off my belt and the strap broke taking my palm crashing to the ground with it and completely ruining it. luckley palm replaced it, but i am also worried about security. i think it would be easier to have your palm piolt stolen as well. my asvice? dont bother with this one."
5,Bluegrass Gospel both joyful and inspiring,"This is a wonderful cd. From the simple arrangement of ""In His Presence"" to the tight vocals of ""When He Welcomes Me In"", Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver have put together a collection that sings God's praises with tremendous joy and thankfulness. ""Help Me Lord"" is a personal favorite. There are songs here about the comfort of our daily walk with Him, and songs that look forward to the eternal blessings yet to come. If you are a fan of bluegrass gospel, I highly recommend this cd."
3,Not Bad,"Stamped right in the metal, Made In China. Little worried about using a control arm from China, since it does hold the wheel on, but it went on easily and got rid of an annoying clunk from the vertical bushing blowing out. Time will tell."
5,Hy Zaret would have loved it.,"William Stirrat, AKA Hy Zaret (pen name), who wrote the words to ""Unchained Melody"", never liked Bobby Hatfield's (Rightous Brothers) version of it becaused he ""jazzed it up"". So, I think he would have loved the way Barry Manilow sang it on this CD. By the way, for those of you, like me, who always wondered where ""Unchained Melody"" got its name, it was featured in the now obscure 1955 prison movie ""Unchained"". It was nominated for Best Song but lost out to another song on this CD ""Love Is A Many Splendored Thing"". History aside, I like the way Barry Manilow presents these timeless classics. You can tell he is singing them with the feeling and respect they deserve. It's much more than ""easy listening"". It's a time capsule back to the '50's."
2,"Bland, uninspired renditions of some great songs.","This CD has some great songs from the fifties. But alas all the songs are belted out in a routine, and uninspired manner. I do believe that this CD was churned out to cash in on the ""oldies gold mine"" so ably exploited by Rod Stewart. Great songs sound boring and a notch below elevator music.If you want to hear some truly great fifties numbers get Anne Murray's superb CD titled ""Croonin'"" (NOT the one titled ""Country Croonin'""). Ms. Murray's work will tickle your memory and give you hours of pleasure."
5,Great Listening!!,I love this CD even though I was a young child in the fifties. Barry sings all the songs splendidly - very relaxing to listen to. I highly recommend this CD to all Manilow fans.
2,"Great oldies, but no pizazz!!","Loved the song selection as it took me back to my childhood in the 50's. But the tempo of EVERY song was so slow, so boring, that I wish I hadn't purchased this. Sorry, Barry. Love ya, but better try again."
1,Goodness me ! This is really terrible !,"Oh my god... how can be possible that he had to fall in such deep nonsense, remaking a whole bunch of old tunes to end up like something much worse than even Muzak? This is the music you'll hear again and again at the supermarket, just sufficiently engineered to num the brain.Frankly speaking , I liked his younger self's songs better than some of the Las Vegas numbers he's putting out these days.This cd is mostly nothing new. And I couldn't help but feel like he was trying to crank money out of those old matrons who like his new bimbo look. Could he not have released a completely new album without Mr.Davis' bad advise ?Is he aware of the ruinous massacre of the American songbook perpetrated by Davis and Rod Stewart ? Isn't this enough ?"
4,Barry's Newest,"I liked the CD very much. He does a great job with the songs which are bringing back a lot of memories. However, I really liked his big band cd better and wish he could do more"
3,Nostalgic,"This disc is very enjoyable because the lyrics are not only understandable , but beatifully written. Only problem I found was that as I listened , I realized how much I enjoyed the originals singers . Just as I like Manilow for his original songs, I realized that I liked the original artists better.I still give Manilow an A for putting together a great set of songs that are easy to listen to."
4,NOT in 5.1 as stated,"I bought this this DualDisc version because it said that the DVD side contains a 5.1 surround mix. Be careful - it doesn't. It just contains a 'Enhanced Stereo' version of the songs. A lot of web sites are stating this is in 5.1 (obviously given the wrong information). The album is what we have come to expect from Barry lately. It sounds like he has walked in, done his vocal, and walked out. Nice tunes but none of them are any better than the originals. And Barry's constant key-changes are really unnecessary here. How long can he continue to bring out cover-version CD's? I love his music but something original in a pop format would be great. He has turned into a Las vegas lounge singer. I can almost see him with an open shirt and a gold medallion. Shame as he can do so much better."
5,"Barry Manilow ""The Greatest Songs of the Fifties""",This CD is fantastic! It could even gain a young audience of 20-30 year olds! Barry Manilow is refreshing and a very talented singer!I would recommend this CD to everyone who likes a song with a message!
3,Such Classics should be Left alone,"Without question, Barry Manilow is a very talented entertainer, one that I truly enjoy. That being said, I find his latest CD just to be Okay. Don't get me wrong, I love the songs on this CD, but for me, the original recordings are the way to go. In fact, Frankie Avalon's Venus will always be my all time favorite. What I'm trying to say is simply this, these classics are just that, classics. Leave them alone. After all, it's like someone else recording the Copa Cabana??? Just my opinion...."
2,"Signs of the Apocalypse, pt. 672","Barry Manilow has a CD on the charts? Did I awaken in a different century? Was ist das? Help me people - I'm having a hard time coping with this....aarrrhhhhgggghhh....I think I'm having the big one, 'lizabeth...."
1,Barry Trashes 50's Songs.,Not a smart buy. Now I've got to figure out a way to erase the memory of having heard this album. Will I be able to listen to the origional artists of these songs ever again???
5,PURE MANILOW MAGIC~BRAVO BARRY!!!,"No wonder Barry Manilow has taken Las Vegas by storm and is the greatest sensation in the desert oasis since Elvis...this guy is singing greater than ever and this wonderous new collection clearly illustrates this! As a small child in the fifties, I remember all of these classic standards well and Barry gives his own uniquely original interpretation to each and every great song yet stays true to the overall great musical feeling of the fifties...and the gorgeous and glorious orchestrations do the same. Lately alot of singers have been going back to revisit greater musical times but none quite as successful as Manilow in this great collection! Bravo Barry Manilow and thank you for another special and lasting musical treat...and do not miss the opportunity of experiencing this great legendary performer in concert!!!"
1,UNINSPIRED,"This album is a travesty to the songs of the 50's. The vocals are horrible, amateurish and uninspired and uninspiring. After hearing this version of ""Unchained Melody"" I hope to never hear any version of this song by anyone again. Just horrible. Barry brings ""generic, uninspired tiredness"" to the track, as well as to most others on the album. I rarely criticize any album or artist but once in a while there is a recording that is so bad it is hard to believe it was recorded, distributed, and actually selling quite well on the charts. To be honest, William Shatner or Regis Philbin would have made a better quality recording. Shame, shame shame. The sad part is I like older artist covering oldies at the twilight of their careers. Trouble is, on this album the voice is so bad it is way past its twilight. It's done like dinner"
3,DUAL DISC....,I LIKE THE SONGS ON THIS DISC. I HAD TO LOAD INTO LAPTOP. TRIEDTO PLAY IN MY 25 DISC CHANGER................JUST BOUGHT A 200 DISCCHANGER. YEP DISC IS WIDER THAN STANDARD CD THEY MUST USE MICROMETER.BUT YES OVERALL A GOOD 3+ STARS.
1,"Only 41 minutes...Would you call it a "" true work of labor"" ?","This album only makes you long for the originals.It's short,bland,and doesn't add anything new to the tracks.Pure saccharine diluted,as always for the Las Vegas entrepreneur."
1,What Barry Wouldnt do to get out of Bankruptcy,Whats next. The Fab 60's?? Barry lands the British Invasion? Lame voice for this period. He should stick to the faboulous 70's...
5,Spend time with your children as much as possible,Children grow up so fast. The book gave me a perspective on what is more important in life. What I liked about the book is that she talked about how to make daily routines less stressful and gave suggestions on simple parenting strategies and discipline strategies.
2,Outdated Edition,"This is now an outdated English edition! This is the English translation of the third edition of the official latin Enchiridion indulgentiarum (1986), but the latin text has been superseded by the fourth edition Enchiridion indulgentiarum (1999).An approved English translation of the current, fourth edition Enchiridion indulgentiarum (1999) is published by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops under the title ""Manual of Indulgences"". You might find that edition a better item to purchase."
2,Buy the Updated Version (not the 1974 version),"I bought this book in 1978, and just got around to reviewing it 30 years later. It hasn't aged well. Actually, it never was a very good guide on how to write better. The latest Random House Handbook is undoubtedly superior."
1,It broke,"I am pretty rough on this stuff, but it broke shortly after I bought it. It might be okay if you are very dainty in using it."
3,MARVEL VS CAPCOM,"Remember back when Street Fighter II (one of the best games.) was popular? Remember how fun it was.Back then all those special moves were actaully special. Nowadays theres a basic button that can do them. Bassically the way to win in this is to press buttons as fast as you can. Thats what my brother and friend do. Those two are obsessed with CAPCOM, and now that the sequel of this wont be on the PLAYSTION my brother is thinkng about spending 200 bucks for a DREAMCAST.(Not that thats a bad decison, I would love to get one.) Just because of one game. MARVEL VS CAPCOM wasnt bad.I have played much worse. I cant say that I reccomend it though,but if you want a 2d fighting adventure this is your kind of game. Maybe CAPCOMs next game will be more like Street FIGHTER II."
1,BULL!,This game stinks a hadfull of characters and you just fight a handfull of people in arcade mode until you reach onsalught. i don't like it.
1,DONT BUY THIS GAME,"This is a horrible, stupid game. All you do is sit there, pushing buttons at random, and you win, even on standerd. The controls? Unresponisve. Get Super smash bros for the N64. if you've got one. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME! IT is brainless."
2,Lack of the Tag Feature really hurts the Playstation here,"If you have played this game in the arcade or on a Dreamcast unit you know how fast and colorful a fighting game this one is. Truth is it is one of the best 2D figthers you can play.Here is the bad news though, if you own a Playstation and want this translation you will be disapointed when you play. First of all the lack of the tag feature really does kill this game. Without being able to tag in another teamate mid battle it takes away some of the games statagy. I think it also seems to move and load much slower on the playstation than in the Dreamcast. We just have to face it, this game is a next generation game on a five year old piece of hardware, and it just does not live up to its true potential. I love my plastation, but I have to advise all to pass on Marvel vs. Capcom for it. Play Street Fighter Alpha 3 instead if you insist on getting the best 2D fighting action you can out of your old Playstation box."
2,Slow and limited,"The dreamcast is the WAY better version to get as this one is too slow and too easy.The playstation port of this game is sadly inept, i am a PSX fan but this game does stand short to the over versions."
3,Great Europop trash!,"The ""guy who would be Bowie"" is over the top, juvenile, and pompous...but never boring (well, sometimes.) But hey, who's keeping score?Some trashy gems on this one, such as the title track; most of the songs are catchy and fun. Fifteen bucks buys ownership of some of the most esoteric pop chestnuts on your block."
3,Where is my song??? Can't find my way home,"Help!!! Does anyone know who sang the song in this movie (obviously it wasn't the original singer) titled ""Can't find my way home""?!?! As I scrolled down the song titles, I noticed it wasn't there. I reeeeally loved the version of this song in the movie and yet, (OF COURSE) it is not listed on this CD which will definitely make me NOT purchase it. Anyway, I just LOVE the song...you know the one, it is playing when Benny is walking on the train tracks with the train behind him...please PLEASE someone email me personally at FinlandLisa@yahoo.com and let me know who sang that version of the song. Thanks so much! God, men just don't get better looking than Johnny!"
2,Benny & Joon,"After writing down all the songs that I heard in the movie (from the credits), I was disappointed to see a lot of them were not on the soundtrack. C.D. I would not have bought it had I noticed. JM"
5,Soul Mates,I have seen this movie at least a dozen times and I bought the CD because the songs kept running through my head and I wanted to hear them. It is so very wonderful when against all the odds in the world two unique individuals who feel alienated and alone no matter that they are continually surrounded by good intentioned people find each other and fall in love. Forever they have placed people who are ahead of their time or thinking on a different level into mental institutions or on drugs. Are these drugs and placements supposed to protect them or the people who place them there and is it because they have something wrong with them or because it makes so called normal people question their own placement in the world. I love Johnny Depp and find that all of his movies are mind bending and cause me to think I love that.
4,A fun album,"I haven't seen the movie, so cannot relate on how this music fares to the film. But I think this album is terrific. The music is fun and creates a nice atmosphere. It makes me think of a circus or a fun fair. I originally bought it for the song ""I'm gonna be (500 miles)"" by The Proclaimers as I loved that song and at the time, couldn't find the album by them that it was featured on, so I bought this. And I am glad I did. It's wonderful. Track #5, ""Hubcaps"", although short, makes me also think of Charlie Chaplin. This album is fun and a treat to listen to. Rachel Portman is a fine composer."
4,A Rare Sound for Comedy,"Usually I won't buy the soundtrack album to a comedy, even if I do enjoy the movie. I tend to think that a lot of comedy music tends to sound about as juvenile as the antics of the film (although that's probably the whole point). This is not the case with Benny & Joon, though. Portman's score is quite enjoyable to listen to by itself. especially her theme for Sam's (Johnny Depp) wackiness. ""I'm Gonna Be(500 Miles)"" by the Proclaimers is an added bonus."
2,Without Faith,"This ""Soundrack"" is about as faithless to the spirit of the film as it could be. This is most evident in the fact that the pivotal song from the film ""Have a Little Faith in Me"" has been omitted. The Proclaimers and Portman's music are indeed appreciated but do little to sooth over the omission of ""Faith"". Boooo"
5,chubidu likes it!,"I'm hard to please. Period. But this book made me read and read and read! I like Taylor's stuff. A believer myself, I had my doubts about Christian fiction. But this lady has her eye on the prize. Who says Christian fiction has to stay ""in the closet""? The real things real people go through are the same things God can fix. Each of these stories touched area of life that I've experienced although my favorite was The Marriage Bed. Check it out."
2,Ugh,I bought this book as a new copy and it looked like it was already used by the black dirt marks on the front cover.
5,Always get second hand,This product came fast just in time for my class and why buy new? It was in perfect shape.
3,good movie but....,"Hands down the worst transfer to dvd I've ever seen. If you know Italian you'll still have the subs on because the sound is totally messed up. Dialogue comes in ever so faintly through the front left speaker instead of the center (and all the speakers are providing hiss. 5.0 surround hiss sound. and the image appears to be transfered from a video source instead of original elements. Result: video burps and vibrating black bars. Ridiculous. Normally I fall back and say: hey, at least it's available at all...but in this case I won't. This is very unpleasant viewing experience."
3,Too short!,"I thought this was like at least a 6ft. long cable but no it's only about 6in. so I had to move my subwoofer closer but I guess it works, I just think Monster is a bit overrated cuz I didn't notice any difference between regular RCA cables and these(just a tighter fit which makes them more secure in place)"
1,Not what it seems!,"When I got my order I saw it was not a Union CD,but a band with the same name,so if ordering don't get the CD,The Union,you'll be sorry!"
5,A SWEET BOOK,"Finally, a book for children about God, exploring the concept of the Creator through descriptions of God's diverse creations; plant, animal and celestial. A fun reminder of how much God loves you! A book that children and adults will enjoy together, with plenty of discussion pages at the end. The illustrations are colorful and sensitive, masterfully done, a beautiful complement to a very sweet book!"
3,"Good disks, but uncompetitive price!","Once again, Sony has developed technology that wows the world, and allows us to capture every living moment on disk. I absolutely love the DVD line, but the disks are too pricey for the practical user. Instead, I would recommend Memorex 8cm DVD-RW disks. You get relatively the same product, from a reputable media provider, Memorex, at HALF THE PRICE! They are available on Amazon.com, and they are definetly a better alternative!"
2,How I used every vocabulary word in the dictionary to write my first novel,"If a writer has a good story to tell why torture nearly every sentence with such verbal complexity when it could have been written intelligently with fewer words? I'm trying to get through this book, waiting for the ""good part"" to kick in. The main characters are overwrought with a thought life that is dull, uninteresting and totally self-involved. And while I know a good deal about art, it isn't enough to save this book from itself."
4,Love this series,"There is nothing that is really grand about this series, but they do entertain and they are different from other book series enough to make it a nice read. It has great laughs in it at different part, esp. the rhowdor bird, which is now the 3rd mate, too funny. I am still waiting for the end of the next trilogy to be finished."
1,Disappointed,"What a disappointment! I thought I purchase the edition with color illustrations of three Matisse paintings. Instead it was a poor quality binding, cover and with pencil drawings.Pat Nuezel"
3,"Sadly, Byatt Misses The Mark Here","In symphonic music, they call the aural equivalent of these stories ""tone poems"". I'm not sure if there is exactly the right description in literature for what Byatt aimed for here, but I think that analogy works. Byatt hoped, I believe, to cement her stories to Matisse in such a way that her words and these tales would represent in image the vivid colors and expression of Matisse's paintings. None of these three stories really gripped me or lingers well in my memory. I think it's fair to say Byatt was hoping to cast her female characters' views on life as a surrogate for how art itself might be viewed as a reflection of human experience."
5,Fun must read book,"Now this is a fun way the Author introduces Dahrma in todays world. From traffic to relationships he does a wonderfull job of getting the point accross.You will stop and re-think in many daily situations.A great read from cover to cover, don't miss a page,the end is awesome!"
5,Practical Spirituality For Every Day Life...,"A good friend of mine gave me this book, perhaps as a not-so-subtle way of telling me I need to keep cool in the choas of my own life. What I thought was an amusing joke from a friend has turned out to be a truly helpful gift -- Arthur Jeon's insights and stories are practical, smart, and easy to work into your life. The book is quick and fun to read and several times a day I find myself thinking about what I've read and reacting to my world a little differently. Somehow Jeon's taken all the great teaching of Eastern Thought and turned them into an easy-to-get manual for adding meaning and fun and reducing stress in our crazy Western World. Highly recommend!"
4,Just like one of their live sets,"Having seen this band live quite a few times in Boston, I can attest that this CD conveys their qualities very well... a great bluesy footstomping romp! Loads of fun - get up & dance around!"
4,raw blues,"Boston quartet does raw, rough and ready versions of old blues classics and obscurities. If you like the kind of blues found on the Fat Possum label, you'll definitely dig this. Great stuff!"
3,Better live,Saw this band in Somerville Ma and with a few beers and friends they were awesome. I am afriad this is a case of a great live band just not translating well in the studio. The songs lack energy and sound emotionally flat.A must see live but the disc is essential only for die hard fans
3,More recipes please!,"""Soy Healthy Cooking"" explains the benefits of cooking with soy beans (in its many forms) and also provides several recipes and ideas for the viewer to try. However, of some of the suggested dishes mentioned - no recipes were given! This was a little frustrating, as I was particularly interested in the Potato and Corn Chowder (one of the mentioned meals, but without a recipe).Despite this, the program was informative and holds your interest. Give it a try!Three stars"
5,A great project and a very nice book,"This was my first project as a ghostwriter (although I was credited as one of the authors) and it was a great experience. Working with with William F. Buckley Jr. was a pleasure! If you live or work in Stamford, you should track down a copy of this magnificent book. The photos by Bill Hubbell are excellent!!!"
5,Worked great,"I had to buy this to transfer all our old camcorder High 8 tapes to my Mac to burn to DVD. Computers are outpacing technology really fast. The old Fire Wire 400 would not work, had to use the 800 to DV input. Well worth the price I paid and it got the job done."
4,Yard Beast,"If you are looking for a cheap, reliable, easy starting lawn mower then look no further. This is the yard beast for you. Its easy to put together out of the box. Its light but feels sturdy enough when you are pushing it, the cut is clean and sharp and weather you decide to mulch or pick it up it does a good job regardless. The one pull start is fantastic, no more priming and then pulling till your arm falls off! My mower is all black not the bright yellow but color asside - this mower is an excellent start for a the first time gardener."
4,Good for price,I've only used it a few times and it is good for the price. My only complaint is that it was damaged during shipping. So I had to take the mower in for repair before I could even use it. The box for these mowers were not designed for shipping purposes.
2,Review from the Synthesis,"With Paper White and Big Black Square, Tarentel walk a fine line between what's considered an EP as opposed to a full-length album. The release of Big Black Square is a 40-minute-plus improvisation that makes the listening experience tedious. Tarentel have a vague idea of where they want to go, they just don't have a compass, and nothing proves this more than the aforementioned track. Ambient noises and feedback play out for 15 minutes before the drumbeat comes in, going for another 15 minutes over feedback before finally fading away into more ambient noises. Paper White is somewhat of the same approach, yet the songs aremuch shorter, with softening touches of acoustic guitar and piano leaving onepleasantly confused.- Nick Walker"
3,"Good, but not orignal","This book is a copycat of the movie and book ""Single White Female"" except it twists some things around. I mostly knew what was going to happen because I have read ""Single White Female"" before. It is a good book though, I didn't like it because it wasn't original."
5,Kirby the sequal,"Yo, What's up? Kirby! This little Poofball, is @ it again, For those that have followed Kirby since he started making an appearance in Nintendo, this is an excellent updated video game! For those of you who haven'y Heard of Kirby Listen up! This little superhero is appelling to both Girls and Boys, for girls he is a cute little guy who just happens to have saved the world a few times, for boys he is a Powerful superhero who can aquire the powers of his enemys by sucking them up and spiting them out. ENJOY!"
4,Easy Game But Great Fun,"Kirby is a great game but it was a bit too easy. The graphics are good on this game, they are not exactly Perfect Dark but thats what we dont want, we want a game thats okay in graphics and great in gameplay and thats whats delivered through Kirby. The levels are plentyfull the appeal is for all ages and it is a game that you will go back to, so i recommend making the investment."
4,good but not great or the way it should be,"This is a fun game and somewhat challenging. However, It doesn't have the challenging effects that the original NES game has. If you are a true Kirby fan, you'll realize that it isn't the same. If you are looking for a good, challenging time It'll be good."
2,"Good to rent, not to own","This game was way to short and i beat it the day I got it. I highly recomend renting it before owning it due to the fact that the replay value is not what it should be. There is a multiplayer feature, but it is very weak compared to other games like Super Smash Brothers."
3,Kirby 64,"My son had to have this. He liked it, but got frustrated at some things. Couldn't tell you what they are. He is 9."
2,Easy,This game is so easy to beat.I beat it in two days.And the mini games are boring.I suggest you don't get this game.
2,Don't buy this game!,This game took me 4 hours to beat and now I'm bored! Don't buy this game! Get a real game like Zelda that took me all summer!
1,"If youre looking for (junk) on N64,youjustfoundit","I bought this game a month back, and it stinks! The people who did ALL the other reviews have no idea what they are saying for this N64 piece of crap. The music is so babyish its not even Kirby music, and THIS GAME STINKS! Hal Laboratory can make better games than this. H---,even Klonoa is better than this. (BORING) Other Kirby games are better than this, too. I had to pelt this with rocks and put it in water."
1,VERY BORING,"OK so my brother bouught crystal shards, it was so boring he beat it in the second day he died like once or twice but some how he still likes it. It might be fun if it was your first N64 game....... and you were 3 years old. Just get away from this page now. And remember I'm trying to save the innocent people from buying a game that looks good and has nice graphics but stay away from it, don't even come back to this page."
3,Great for a child's first game.,"If cuteness was being rated, Kirby would definately be a 5 star game. Unfortunately, some of the other aspects of the game aren't as great. It's a typical Kirby game - rediculously easy. I'm not trying to say that this game wasn't fun, but the levels and mini games were so easy I beat the entire thing in 2 days. Also, the part that annoys me the most is that you don't use the joystick on your N64 paddle, you use the arrow key pad.Personally, I give this game 3 stars. However, the cute scenery and easy controls would be perfect for a beginning gamer. I also think that Kirby might be a little more appealing to girls, but again, that's my opinion. I recommend it for ages 5 - 12."
3,"good, but not great","this game is a good game to rent, but to buy this game is a total waste of money. I suggest renting the game first to try it out. I beat the game in only 2 days. The Levels are really, really easy. This is more of a game begining gamers"
