4,Makes life easier,These insulated staples (and the gun that goes with them) has been a godsend. The staples come in three sizes for different wire sizes (and the large ones can be used with small bundles).These have saved me so much time doing network installs. It definitely beats hammering nails/staples (especially in tight spots).I've used these inside and out.The only improvement would be if they would make the staples out of stainless for exterior applications (I've had to do quite a bit of exterior wiring in marine environments).
5,Worth the money,"These cables are excellent. I was looking for a cable long enough to connect my computer to the home theater.Apparently Belkin and Monster do not make cables this long so I took a chance with these and I am really pleased.The color is white, which would be my only complaint. However it does not look like a cheap cable from the dollar store. The connections are NOT gold pleated but you cannot tell the difference. The sound quality is excellent. I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine."
2,Kind of pricey for a cable,"As a cable, yes, it works. The red strip around the plug for the right channel is coming off straight out of the box. Cheaply made."
4,Comprehensive,"I could bake every day for a year and not have tried all the recipes in this book! Includes basics like blueberry muffins, and some more unusual options like Cinnamon Honey Waffles. Helpful diagrams clarify some of the potentially confusing directions. I recommend this to anyone who's tried all the commonly available bread recipes and is looking to branch out."
5,a good transaction,This is a great book- I really liked it and I highly recomend it to anyone interestd in automation and history.
2,Inferior to the other Turk book,"Better, as it uses original documents, is the ""other"" Turk book:The Turk, Chess Automatonby Gerald M. Levitt"
5,I confess I read the last two chapters first,"I bought this book because the review in Book Lust got me interested. It arrived and I read the last two chapters first I wanted to know the secret ( and no, I am NOT telling). If the rest of the book is a good as the last two chapters I'll be content."
1,Classic 2nd book failure,"Lowell's first novel was excellent, a definate keeper. I enjoyed it so much, I searched Amazon last year for the date of the publishing of her next effort, No Escape, and anxiously searched two Super Wal-Marts, a Books-A-Million and a Hastings in Lee County, Alabama, awaiting the book.ACK!All the anticipation, all the salivating; it's like opening a beautifully wrapped gift from a loved one and finding used kitty litter inside.Please, please, please, pay attention to the profession review.It is Ever So Correct!The book is trite and honestly, not worth the paper it was printed upon.Go to used bookstores or local libraries if you want to read the book, but please don't pay full price.(an excellent clue as to if a novel is any good is seeing how cheap used copies are. This novel is going for less than a buck at Amazon!!!)I haven't given up on Heather Lowell, and I will try her next novel.Just write No Escape off as the cliched 2nd novel disaster."
3,Left this one at the beach.,"No sense in hauling this one home, not worth it.It was too simplistically written.There was a constant review of the evidence and theories.Tessa was an idiot. She can't trust men because of what her dad did to her twenty years ago. I don't even remember what it was, that's how big an impact this book had on me. And she can't trust men because guys she's dated wanted a more committed relationship. Shame on them!Tessa was so nave. ""He'd never do that. That would not happen."" Mind you, these comments weren't made about someone or something she actually knew.She refused to recognize danger even though she knew the Mob was heavily involved in the case. We're supposed to believe she's a DA?"
5,More Nostalgia,"I grew up with this music, so it was nice to find so many in one collection. Terrific nostalgia music. Thanks Amazon."
3,facemask,"purchased this item used! However, this fasemask did not fit the youth helmet correctly,didnt quite figure this out; might have to drill alt. holes move hardware?"
2,Did not like this tape,I purchased this tape for my beginning violin students. I thought that having different colors would help the visual learners. The tape comes off easily after a few weeks (the silver tape is fine though). You are better offer purchasing the color tape that is sold at Staples or Walmart. The tape at Staples and Walmart is not cut thin for you but it stays in place.
4,Very good,"Although I appreciate bluegrass, I am not an expert. I really love this CD; I heard a few songs on Pandora and later bought the CD.My three favorite songs on the album are: Roving Gambler, Ribbon of Darkness and Big Iron. The singer who sings on Ribbon of Darkness and Big Iron has a very distinctive and pleasant voice."
2,LEXMARCK Z611 colot ink jet printer,DIDNT WORK AT ALL-- SELLER has strong history on returned printers lexmarks other--tryed it on 2 other computers and windows lap top (older model lap top)i had to return it---to many problems
3,Performs Well,"For the price, this printer performs fine and has done so for the last month. I would not recommend purchasing it online, because shipping cost more than the item itself. Also, you'll need to purchase a USB cable and black ink cartridge seperately. Do yourself a favor, go down to Best Buy and pick up a printer that comes with everything."
2,"Good Cheap Printer, But...Caveat Emptor","Yes, let the buyer beware on this one. As far as I can tell (by putting the specifications and photos side-by-side) the Z611 is is identical to its ""big brother"" the Z615 (available for about $20 more) with these important exceptions: the Z611 comes with no black ink cartridge or USB cable...and the Z615 does. Saving a few backs by excluding a USB cable I get...but deleting the black ink cartridge? Come on, Lexmark!...I guess the printer business is a cuthroat one. Apart from that, it's a fine little printer for the price and performs well...but only makes sense if you happen to have a USB printer cable and a Lexmark #16 or #17 black ink cartridge already lying around. Otherwise, save a few dollars by buying the Z615."
5,Lexmark is finally getting it,"From the reviews here the lack of USB cable is the biggest beef; I've been buying USB printers for years and have a drawer-FULL of USB cables and am glad to NOT have to pay Lexmark to include yet another one.Another benefit is the lower-than-average cost of the cartridge; once the included one is used up, the replacement is 50% less than typical cartridges.Simple, basic printer for the kids/household use.Kudos"
5,Great time saver!,"After ordering one teacher's guide, I ordered one for every novel I planned to use for the school year. The guide was packed with excellent information and activities that saved me so much time in preparing my units! I liked the way the guide was organized."
5,Great for the money!,"It does all I needed it to do. I have a Technics SL-1350 turntable it took less than 5 mins to set up and go, to my amp reciever. The sound quality seems very good to me,my vinyl is not prestine anyway. I do have some LP's that are prestine and can detect no background noise with them."
3,"Good, but outdated","It's not my first rodeo, but I've not rebuilt a Ford V-8 before. I found this manual to be pretty decent, but it was published about 30 years ago and didn't have info on fuel injection, newer aftermarket cylinder heads, cams, etc. If you're building a stroker, fuel injected, or modified engine, this may not be your cup of tea, but for a basic, stock rebuild of a mid-70's small block, it should provide what you're looking for."
3,Mediocre,"This would be great if everything you needed to do to your engine started from bare block, otherwise its a little vague. I would reccomend buying a Haynes or Clymer manual for the vehicle."
5,Fantastic book ;,"This book is a great book, period... It's served me very well more than once and clearly had all the information that I needed to help build several motors, including one for my son's Mustang.Same thing with the "" How to rebuild your Ford V8 351 C-351M-400-429-460 "".. I've built several 351 Cleveland's and both were very good rebuilds.The author does a great job of explaining exactly what you need to do; you must be able and willing to do the rest and you will succeed."
2,How to rebuild small-block Ford Engines,It did not have enough information on setting timing. Also did not have enough information on engine identification.
4,Do you remember when kids were interested in the world?,"I had a copy of this book when it was first published and Iprobably read it ten times. Recently, I found a copy on Amazonand re-read it.As history, it's probably a bit light-weight, but then most kids'books are. What charmed me again was the idea that there oncewas a series of books called the Landmark books and that theyexplained the world to children. Not just how things worked buthow canals connected the world and how the workers who dug thembecame part of the world they connected and how fortunes weremade and people and cities thrived because of a new way of lookingat things.Samuel Hopkins Adams was my first favorite author and I'm glad I getthis chance to say thanks.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE New Short Course in Wine,The andthe novel bang BANG. bang BANG: A Novel"
4,Good service,"I got the book in a very short time and the process was also quick. 2 years ago, I had a problem with an Amazon affiliated store and took me such a long time to get my money refunded but this time, Amazon did a great job.Thank you for shipping in time!"
1,Useless book,"I read this book cover to cover and I didn't learn a single thing about making bombs. People, please do not waste your time reading this book. A much better book would be John Grisham novels."
3,Skip this and get the platinum edition instead.,"I just bought platinum edition of Perry's for $159, whichincludes both the book and this CD, a much better deal than paying$119 for the CD only. As for the quality of the CD, there are some things to like and some to hate about it. Since it's in Adobe Acrobat format, it's easy to print off a few pages, but it's fuzzy if you don't have a good laser-jet printer. You can't resize the font as you can in MSword or Wordperfect. Because of the 2-column layout of Perry's, it is very tedious trying to read a page from your screen using Acrobat, unless you happen to have 20/20 vision and a 21+-inch monitor. As far as the portability of the data goes, it's easy to copy (CTRL+C) and paste from the ""active objects"" which only cover part of all the data, but very messy to copy directly from Adobe Acrobat. My advice is if you want this CD, then go ahead and spend the extra $40 and get the 3000 page book as well."
2,What's all the fuss?,"Perry's has been gathering dust on my bookshelf at home for years. I always think of it as the book to go to if you want to NOT find the answer to something. In my 20 year career and in my PE test effort, the only thing I ever used it for was to look up properties of substances. It is NOT friendly to the working engineer, since it quickly veers into arcane academic territory on every subject, or else is too general to be useful. This is a serious review of this book by a ChE PE, but I know this review will get panned by all, not because it is not useful, but because you do not agree with it."
4,Vast amounts of info but can be difficult to use,"Indeed there is a great deal of info in this text but there is so much that it can be difficult to use. Some changes have brought about great discouragement, especially in the process control section. Shinskey once again misses the practicallity of process control to try and baffle people with theory. Great for tabulated information on a great deal of chemical substances, however. Once you're able to ""harness the power"" it is a must for both school and industry."
2,Good Tables,"I have used this book only when I need thermodynamic, physical or chemical data. However the other sections of this book are not practical at all, for those who can read and apply from pure math this is the one; for those looking for practical applications using the information given by this book, sorry fellas this is not the place for it."
5,A riveting book from start to finish!,"Perry has outdone himself once again. The seventh edition is even more of a show-stopper than the previous editions. I read this book from cover to cover in one sitting, unable to put it down for a moment, not even to relieve myself! The molecular weights were so accurate and the heats of reaction made my spine tingle. Once I reached the section discussing distillation and tray efficiencies I new I was hooked. I won't give away the ending but it's definitely a shocker. Bravo to Mr. Perry's and I am counting the days to the release of your 9th edition!"
1,Poor use of tables,"As a practicing ChemE, I have used the hardcopy for years. I thought this was a great addition to my IPAD, but it is not. If you wish to read any of the tables, they are almost impossible to dicipher. The table data is the most useful in Perry's. Not in this issue as you cannot enlarge the view because of the blur in the tables. I would have not bought this if I had tried it.Sorry, my old Perry's will still travel with me.Jim P"
3,A must to show the reality,This is the best book to show how distant are the theory and the practice of a Chemical Engineer.
5,Excellent,"This book is a must have for any Chemical Engineer professional or student.I had the 6th edition and updated to the 8th, new information is included and some updated."
3,He is changed!,"After listening this CD from my friend's home, I wonder if I should buy his music again. Frankly, I still want he will change his music because his music in Electric Band gave me more memory than the ""acoustic"" one. I couldn't say this CD is bad, but I somehow feel bored. Personally, I listen more classical music than anything. But, I would rather listening his electric bass sound more than this. As a fans of him, I would buy one for my collection...otherwise...!"
5,3-vocalists = love,"Dealership comes roaring in with their second album. It is hard to find a bad track on the CD.""FOR SALE"" uses the talents of all three singers -- as does ""TV HEART"" -- there is something extremely lovely about Chris G being accompanied by both Jane and Chris W.Much of the album's beauty lies in the song structure. The storytelling through the different staccato of the beat of guitar or keys, bass and drums and how they interact with each other to compose the song.Get the album already!"
4,Very good but not impartial,"Like almost all osprey books, this one is extraordinary; the archeological evidence is solid enough, the angus mcbride plates, altough not the best, are quite good and informative.But after this favorable review why didn't I gave a 5 stars? Because Mr. Secunda is partial...He portrays the Romans like the ""bad guys"", he doesn't lie about what the romans did, but he forgets to mention that their foes were as vicious (sometimes worst) as the romans were.All in all is a good book and I recommend it."
4,osprey n 291republican roman army 200-104 bc,"Es un excelente Libro amplia sobre la poco conocida legión romana antes de el imperio, solo que el autor se queda un poco escueto e imparcial en cuanto a la legion Romana de este periodo; en referencia al ilustrador Angus Mcbride como siempre sublime en sus ilustraciones que aporta a esta obra."
3,"Worked out, but a little sketchy","The poster was not the Deminsions listed of 27x40. It was actually a little bit wider. In the red text, you can see black print, perhaps from a previous print job. Someone needs to check their print plates or ink downs and clean them before they start a new project. All and all I trimmed the poster down to size so it fit the frame, and behind glass the bad print is hardly noticeable. Worked out, but hoped for more."
3,MY CLAIM,"Basicly in my opinion this album is avarage @ best. I liked Yak's singles from fondle em and def jux, and even his ish from The Conspiracy, but his 1st solo album just doesnt cut it. His flows are decent, but his voice just gets kinda annoying after awhile. My other complaint is on the beats, Mondee is an okay producer but his beats are typical for lack of a better word. Highlites are ""Pimped Out"" Ft. Cage, ""Spy on You"", and ""O.D.E."" Ft. Tame One. The rest of the album is easily forgetable, nothing amazing here. 3 dope tracks out of 15 = waste of money."
1,Wack Ballz,"I recently saw Yak open for Mr. Lif in Philly and my friend and I couldn't believe how aweful the lyrics where. Yak's voice is not for everyone, and his delivery and flow are skillful, but he was spitting about the most moronic stuff I've heard in a while. Lines referring to ""sipping on"" alcohol and ""not giving a #@!$"" were thematic of his whole attitude---he was preoccupied with conveying some measure of 'badness' (he probably mentioned his 'crew' about 20 times) and completely negating the opportunity to rap about something culturally clever, conceptual, socially-engaged, et cetera. He seems like the kind of guy who hangs out with people who start fights and have pencil-thin mustaches/flat-brimmed baseball caps. I was embarassed for him, by him, and wished desperately that he'd stop rubbing his pinky finger against his pectorals in that stroke-victim/hood-rat gesturing sort of way. I can't believe Def Jux associates themselves with him..."
2,Not a lot of peppermint,"I love this stuff and was willing to pay what ever to get it, but I was disappointed to find that there was not very much peppermint in the bark. It was like 4/5 white chocolate and 1/5 peppermint at a MINIMUM it should be at least half and half."
3,Mirage III Around the World,A well presented and a good choice of photographs with direct information and a resume of the principal operator of this fighter. Also is a good auxiliary to modeler on colors and camouflages.
4,A Great Book for the beginner,"I strongly disagree with all of the other reviews... I am not a beginning PC user (MCSE & CNA), but I've never had any experience with Access. Yeah, there are typos, but if you understand the exercise, you should be able to figure out what to do. I have recommended this book to several of the people that I work with in IT. The author does remind you to open the program way too many times, and the author does change at day 18 (for the worse) - I now have a very good understanding of Access, all thanks to this book."
1,Don't buy this book!,This book is the most poorly edited book I have ever seen on any subject. It is full of errors. Please do not waste your money on it!
1,I did not find this book particularly helpful...,"The author of this book is not dealing with difficult ideas or content, but still manages to confuse the user. This is because the language and terms he uses are not consistent and his explanations lack focus, clarity and depth.It is possible to learn Access from this book, but the user certainly has to make a bigger effort than might be necessary if more thought had been given to the book.A small but irritating point: it is difficult to remove the CD without damaging the back cover..."
2,Too many errors.,"This book is good for a beginner, but with the errors that are contained in the text, the reader would need to be a more advanced user to get some things to work correctly. Most chapters leave the reader wanting more, but maybe that is asking to much of 21 day course."
2,"Great Concept for book, but examples are incomplete","I think this was a great concept for a book, but was quickly frustrated the incomplete examples in the book. The way the databases are set up, when you get to certain portions of the book, it tells you to be working with certain data that doesn't exist and doesn't tell you how to get it in there.I returned this book about 3/4 the way through. I don't have time to correct mistakes while I learn."
4,Good beginners book,"This book is a good buy for the beginner. It covers areas that the other teach yourself books have not covered on Access. Mainly design issues. You may be able to create a working database, but without proper design, the pain of correcting it is intense."
1,if your IQ is less than a house plant this book is for you!,"Holy [moly] this book is mind numbing. Not having had anyexperience with Access i decided to pick up this book in order tolearn it real quick like. Now i may not have had any experience with Access but i have heard of a computer before in fact i may have even seen one at one point, but this book assumed that i had no idea that civilization had advanced beyond the dark ages. What i'm trying to say is, that this book teaches the obvious. Even if you've never used access ever you'll still find 400 of this books 600 pages totaly remedial. This book could have been reduced to ten pages and still have been as informative. After reading this book i wish i had spent my money on fork so i could stick it in my head, yes that definately would have been more fun, and it probably would have taught me more about access."
1,Horrible,"I was very disappointed with this album. Her lead single ""Get Real"" was the only glimmer of hope on this album, which is quickly dissolved by track #2. This album went in the garbage."
2,disappointed,"PROS: the 16-foot line is long enough to keep a safe distance without getting your skis all tangled; I was even able to put it around my waist so that we were both ""attached"" to the line. Also, the material seems sturdy enough. The mesh bag that it comes in is convenient for storage and for tossing it into a backpack. You can steer the child by pulling on the line, like reins.CONS: I was unclear from the packaging exactly how to attach the harness to the child. The front attachment also didn't seem secure -- it was too easy to slide the nylon line through the belt loops. It was awkward to use the harness, and in the end it was easier (and less scary for the child) to ski without it."
4,Not that mini,"I expected this to stack on my current roto shockmount SKB rack OK. I was mistaken. This thing is much bigger than the roto shockmount. Looks like I'm going to have to buy the roto roller in order to stack this safely on another rack. Still, it is a decent rack. It's a little heavier than I would have liked but that's OK. I'm not gonna be a wimp about it. It could be worse. In the end, I think it's a decent rack for my purposes which are to rack my mobile recording gear. Adding the roto roller to this will provide just enough rack spaces and the two pieces make this workable as far as weight. It's a keeper for me."
2,An irresponsible experiment! Spay? Neuter? Leashes?,"This book made me mad all the way through! Who on earth let's dogs run the busy streets of Eastern Mass? Who thinks it is funny to let their dogs run, show up on someone's porch who will look at their tags and call her to give them a ride home? She does nothing scientific, but apomorhpizes quite a bit. I feel sorry for those dogs in many ways."
4,Looking at Dogs With the Heart,"This is a wonderfully touching book in which the author closely observes the lives of her dogs over the years while interfering with their activities as little as possible. It is a book with a lot of heart and some interesting insights into the ways of a dog's life, what dogs want, and so forth. Thomas' approach to her dogs is that they are not slaves to be trained to her beck and call, but animals to whom she provides food, shelter, love, and a lot of freedom. This last aspect seems to be what offends some people, and some of what Thomas does certainly seems inappropriate for a city environment. But, this is not a book on dog training, animal subordination to humans, nor is it a dry scientific study. It is a book by someone with heart about the creatures with whom she shares years of her life. It is short, sweet, and will touch your heart if you let it."
4,Very Interesting,"Despite all of the negative comments of other readers, I really enjoyed this book. It was a very interesting look at the natural behavior of dogs. It is actually one of my favorite dog books and I would recommend it to any one facinated by how dogs think, form relationships, etc. All of these other people need to relax. She obviously is an animal lover and takes care of her pets. So she let her dog cross a busy street unsupervised...get over it!After reading this, pick up a copy of her book ""The Social Life of Dogs."" I loved them both."
1,Didn't like this at all,"I have to agree with the readers who described this book as irresponsible. The author's opinions on her dogs' behavior are just that - her OPINIONS (granted, she's entitled to her opinions). Anyone who has had their dog or cat killed by unleashed, free-roaming dogs will hate this. I also found her constant references to a dog's mate as ""husbands"" and ""wives"" really annoying (my opinion). I wish I had seen these reviews before buying this thing."
1,Get those dogs away from this woman!,"This little book is a riff of anthropomorphic nonsense about a group of dogs that have had the misfortune to pass through Ms. Thomas' hands over the years. This is a woman who acquires dogs ""one for each member of the family,"" as though she were purchasing toothbrushes. She has no compunction about letting a dog left in her care wander at will over a large urban area, including crossing busy highways, ""just to see where he went!"" She does not believe in training dogs, but rather ""lets them train themselves,"" and she apparently has not heard of spaying or neutering as the responsibility of a pet owner. I finished the book, but felt like throwing it against the wall more than once."
1,This is a story - not a study,"I bought this book when it first came out but didn't read it until recently. I'm not sure really what I expected but this was not it. Yes the book makes a fun and touching story, but to suggest that it even approaches scientifc validity and reliability is absurd. I only give it one star because it is not what it claims to be. Read this book for fun - not to gain insight into dogs' lives. I agree with an earlier comment regarding the irritating, ever present voice of the author. She is not a particularly good writer and her ego is all too apparent. I won't comment on her irresponsible treatment of her dogs except to agree with previous observations."
1,Definately not a how to guide...,"I wholeheartedly agree with all the negative reviews previously stated. This person was very irresponsible and should not have been allowed to own dogs. As a volunteer in a local animal shelter I see many dogs in similar conditions, that have suffered from overcrowded conditions and neglect which allowed them to go semi-wild. Furthermore, as a ""noted"" anthropologist, she didn't even use good science. The author based her opinion on one small group of dogs, specifically one breed. Although the shelter dogs I work with are out of their element (as pets), the variety of dogs, breed traits, and individual personalities make it clear that you can't stereo-type all dog behavior by observing one particular group. That would be like surveying a small portion of Los Angeles and then claiming their opinion reflects the total population of California."
2,the hidden life of dogs,"This is a biography only of specific dogs instead of a person or persons and as such is first rate, insightful and would be interesting to anyone who likes dogs, from about 10 years old on.This is so well written, not scientific, but could add scientific data to the canine pool."
4,"NOT a training book, but a nice look at dog life!","A wonderful look at the lives of dogs. This book is clearly written with the purpose of showing what a dog's perspective might be. Its easy to see how someone not willing to think could be offended at the bad example and poor training methods shown, but that is not the author's goal. A plumbing book would make a poor electrical guide, as this book is in no way a doggie ""how to."" Taken for what it is, it shows very nicely, a bit of what dogs are all about."
2,Stylish but lacking substance,"Prettily written, but if it's scientific study you're after, you'll be disappointed. This is one person's circumscribed experience with some dogs, full of poetic anthropomorphizing and fluffy conjecture."
5,Simply a beautiful little book,"This is a beautiful little book, well written and clear. The author loved her dogs and treated them with respect and dignity. There is no anthropomorphising of the animals behaviour and the author is quick to check her own sentiment. She let her dogs be dogs, probably to an extent greater than most of us would allow. She neither patronised nor diminished her dogs through behaviourial techniques. The readers who object to the methods as outlined I think are missing the point of this remarkable book. Yes, her methodology would not work for everyone. Yes, a dog which runs loose in a city is a nuisance or even a menace. But this is not a primer on dog obedience!! Read again: this is not a how-to manual for your dog. However, it is an affecting account -poetic at times- of looking at dogs as dogs. We should be grateful for that."
1,"Very, Very Bad, Disappointing, and Disgusting","I have to say this is the first book review I've writen, I just haven't been compelled to write any reviews. After reading this book I changed my mind. I was so utterly DISGUSTED by this author's total irresponsible treatment of her dogs. I have read many books about dog behavior and I thought I would get a little more insight from this book. How wrong was I? I finished the book out of sheer determination. I read all the reviews written for this book and all of the negative ones are true. She let her dogs run wild through busy streets, she did not spay or neuter any of her dogs, had many unwanted puppies (which she allowed her dogs to kill), and the list goes on. This was not a scientific experiment it was neglect and abuse. If you would like an insightful/refreshing book about dog behavior that does not involve irresponsible ownership/guardianship buy Patricia McConnell's ""The Other End of the Leash."""
1,How To Alienate Your Canines For Fun and Profit,"Recipe for Disaster:Get a dog for every member of the family.Don't spay or neuter any of them.Allow them all to run free for a year while you follow along, observing them as they run through traffic, fight, and place themselves in danger of death or injury with regularity.Don't establish a relationship with any of them, work with them, and train them in any way.Watch and take copious notes as they withdraw from the family and revert to survival behavior.Write a book about the experience and make a lot of money. Fool the masses into thinking that this was a fascinating experiment and therefore any irresponsible behvior on the part of the author was somehow justified.I threw this book in the garbage, where it belongs."
1,A Guide On How To Be An Irresponsible Owner!,"Even after 14 years in animal control, I still am sometimes surprised at how well people can rationalize their irresponsible behavior where pets are concerned. And this lady made money off of it! A woman who has no regard for either the dogs nor her neighbors, I also find it hard to believe that her behavioral insights can be respected when even her own dogs ignore her ""leadership"" by the end of the book. A very regrettable book that glorifies dangerous, unthoughtful and uncaring treatment of dogs."
2,Careless Dog Owner Profits from Danger to Her Own Dogs,"I was saddened to read this book. On the one hand, Ms. Marshall helps us learn about the ""hidden life of dogs"" but she does so in an incredibly irresponsible fashion. She basically lets her dog run loose, nightly crossing busy highways and running through suburban neighborhoods, while she observes him. I found this to be an appalling way of learning about dog behavior, as she risks her own dog's life and the peace of mind of her neighbors to gather fodder for her book. For this reason only, I can't recommend this book because it indirectly advocates the kind of careless dog ownership that endangers the companion animals we should, instead, cherish and protect."
1,Not a book for training but preaches the horrors of over population,"Got this book to help me understand my awsome rescued 9 year old dog. Instead I now know far too much about Misha's peeing habits and the gruesome outlook of unwanted, discarded critters. I would never let this woman look after any of my critters. After 32 pages - I'm donating it to Goodwill. Get ""The Loved Dog"" by Tamar Geller for a book that's an uplifting book all about dogs from someone who observed wolves behavior in the wild. AND will help you truly understand your dog."
1,Portrait of an IRRESPONSIBLE dog owner!,"I read this book over the weekend, and it bugs me more every day. Humans have spent 14,000 years domesticating dogs; we are responsible for their health, well-being, and behavior. Marshall Thomas has neglected her duty to her dogs by allowing them to roam freely into danger, breed indiscriminantly (with disasterous results), and generally placed them and others (human and canine) at risk by allowing animal instinct to take over in an unnatural situation (11 dogs in a city house). What she has learned in the process of ""observing"" the behavior of her dogs is NOT worth the suffering and problems that have been caused to them and others. This book will ANNOY the heck out of anyone who really cares about their dogs."
1,"Spare yourself: poorly researched, ill written piffle","No star, really, but that wasn't an option. Ms. Thomas gives herself away very early in the book, wondrous that a dog would cross a street without looking both ways. The most elementary knowledge, kindergarten level, of canine anatomy allows for less wonder; a dog's eyes are placed much further to the side of the head than ours, which face forward. A dog has a 270 degree field of vision. The pages which follow that street-crossing revelation, pages which I was dumb enough to read, contain nothing but twaddle."
3,"well written, but hard to read","While this book is well written I found it hard to read. I found it incredible that anyone would let a dog loose on the streets to ""follow"" it around and that she watched one of her dogs get raped. Her words not mine. I also noted that she mentioned problems with her neighbors due to the dogs. I am a dog lover and found some of this hard to swallow. I detest irresponsible dog ownership. She seemed to be so single focused on studying the dogs that common sense went out the window in the interest of ""science"" and one could argue there isn't much science involved in her methods."
1,"Should be called ""A portrait of the irresponsible pet owner""","Absolutely nothing new here. Really, what could you learn from someone who thinks it is fascinating to watch her supposedly beloved dog cross the Alewife Parkway in Cambridge -- repeatedly! As she revels in allowing her ""dogs to be dogs"" all I could think about was: imagine being her neighbor! (which she does, in fact, imply is pure hell). Maybe if she had learned something interesting from her supposed research you could argue it was worthwhile, although I personally have trouble with the idea of potentially sacrificing great dogs to senseless research. Everything she finds enlightening has already been (better) researched and basically comes straight out of wolf research. Send in the humane society (the dog catcher has already called -- several times)!"
2,I Paid for a Review?,This read like promotional material from the publisher. It was just a 5-page summary (4 pages if you discount the cover) of the contents of the book with very little outside insight.
5,"Amazing, clear and like a classic.","Davetian has written of ethnic rivalry, civil war and genocide in the best tradition of a writer like Solzhenitsyn. The outrage of the writer is elegantly controlled by a prose style which is impeccable in its presentation of emotions that might otherwise be too much for the reader. In the wake of horrors like September 11, this book says much about humanity's need for reconciliation. The story in the book about the life of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, now listed on the Nobel Literature Prize site, is one of the best summaries of the Soviet writer's tribulation. Davetian takes up where Solzhenityn stopped; writing without judgement, he documents the anatomy of cultural conflict and how easily a disaggrement can escalate into individual and collective savagery. A must for all lovers of good literature and,definitely, all makers of international policy."
3,OK for Baxt's fans,"Not a mystery (the reader knows who is behind the deaths), more an exercise in pushing the envelope (even for 1988). Baxt's dialogue is sometimes crude, often peppered with sexual innuendo, and frequently funny (describing the event where the tragedy occurs he says: ""It was one of those parties where all the women hoping to look like Diane Keaton looked like Buster Keaton."") It runs at a fast clip, especially once the murders start, and if you enjoy Baxt's irreverent style of writing, it'll satisfy. Others, beware."
3,Not worth the trouble,"This product was defective. OCZ did replace it, and the replacement memory works, but the trouble I had to go through was not worth it. I would buy a different brand next time."
1,Does not perform as adevertised,"I couldnt make them work at 800 mhz, computer was very unstable. Was using Striker Exterme and Q6600 so its not the rest of the hardware.VERY DISAPPOINTED. Should be marketed at real (ie 666) speed"
2,Complete and Utter Fluff,There's no spark whatsoever in Spark. If you're interested in the subject of co-creation read Eric von Hippel's Democratizing Innovation instead.http://being-reasonable.com/index.php/weblog/permalink/a_spark_that_wont_light_anyones_fire/
2,Please don't get fooled like I did.,"After waiting patiently for the release of this new edition of a game I truly used to cherish and tell all of my friends about, this is the worst (...) letdown I have experienced since my mother died. And all I have to ask is ""Why in the heck would Sid have done this to us?"" Good people, if you want to waste you time tinkering with an aggravating headache, fork out (money) on Civilization 3. Otherwise, I'd strongly advise keeping your investments in your 401 accounts. With sincerity and disappointment; Jessica Williams"
1,Fire Firaxis,"FU Firaxis!... And have a shameful,broke Christmas! Your public sentiments exactly?!?! Would have been better off buying a Yoko Ono record!"
1,The Recent Trend...,"The recent trend seems to be that almost every developer feels his product can walk on water and regardless of bugs or gameplay issues... releases it. This product is no exception... in fact it helps cement the trend into almost a rule. Perhaps next year this game, after being patched and repatched, will live up to 1% of the hype. Civilazation 3 from ""The Great Sid Meier"", bah... perhaps when he was innovative and spent time on his products! This game is nothing but a testament to his ego and disdain for his customers. Avoid this product like the plague... if you want a good CIV play experience pickup CIV II on discount... you'll wish you paid more for it, because it is what this game should have been."
1,oh..my god Civ3,"If you want to play with a cheating stupid computer, Civ3 is your best choiceI have played Civ 3 for about a damn week and found it fligging interesting"
1,oops....civ3,"I feel so disapointed about Sid's civ3The computer keeps on cheating.Each round take a heck lot of time to complete.Corruption is enormous. A bug????Combat is so dump! a strategic game????I feel so (...) since I ""was"" a civ fan for 10 yearsSid, Give me a reason to buy civ4"
3,"The Game is good, but the LE is a waste of money","The games is good, a lot of bugs, but still a good game. Limited Edition, is only a tinbox with a poster inside, the rest you'll get with the standard package. [$] for a lunchbox is a bit over the top."
1,"Civ III - Civ I with better graphics, ho hum","I couldn't wait to get my copy of CIV III. To listen to the hype I was sure this was gonig to be a great game. I loved CIV II and surely this was going to be even better.What a disappointment. The ONLY thing neat about the game is the diplomacy and even that drives me nuts sometimes. We're back to individual units in combat so there's no real benefit in having a large force. Don't even think about being peaceful in the begining of the game. The only way I do well is to attack attack attack. The combat system doesn't seem balance either. (see all the other negative reviews for why, my comments would just be a repeat of theirs.)I wish I could get my money back. Definately a game that will collect dust soon as I (strangely enough) go back to playing CIV II. They may have fooled us into thinking this was going to be a great upgrade/next version but I hope when CIV IV comes out, we have learned our lesson from CIV III and just walk away. (...)"
1,The book is okay.,"The book gives you the inside look into human resources-roles,certification, evolution of hr, and the practice. This bookis rather thin for its price and one part of the book that I really don't like is it tells you alot of info, but doesn'texplain why. Also, there is no info on graduate school forthe human resources program. I'm a career changer from technology and I'm still confused at the end of the book."
2,Hmmmm....Is this....SNAPCASE?,"What can I say about this album? I think the only real comment I can give to people interested in buying this album is that, if you liked Progression Through Unlearning, It doesn't mean you will like their new album. The sharp edges that PTU offered have been ground down to leave what sounds like, hardcore gone commercial? If your a die-hard snapcase fan, you'll like it though. And I must admit it does have some pretty sick ryths in it!"
1,I thought Snapcase was a hardcore band,"Snapcase went mainstream with this album, no more hardcore. If you are a hardcore listener, don't bother wasting your time."
3,Decent Metal/Punk CD,"This was the 1st Snapcase CD that I had ever heard, and I bought it based on the reviews on this page. Snapcase are heavy, but I don't know that I would necessarily call them hardcore. I will definately go buy ""Progressions Through Unlearning"" based on my experience with this CD. Best songs included ""Target"", ""Disconnector"", and ""Bleeding Orange""."
4,"A Definitive Performance of Bruckner's 7th Symphony, But....","This splendid recording of Chailly conducting the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Berlin is widely acclaimed as one of the finest versions of Bruckner's 7th Symphony. Truly, it is a magnificent, stirring account greatly aided by Decca's excellent sound quality. If price isn't an issue, then this is the Bruckner 7th Symphony recording to buy. However, I am appalled by Decca's decision to reissue this mid 1980's recording at full price; a more prudent choice would have been reissuing it as a budget CD which Decca's colleagues at Deutsche Grammophon and Philips have done for many of their early digital releases. Otherwise, I would recommend finding a cheap copy of Solti's fine account with the Chicago Symphony (London/Decca) or taking a look at Masur's underrated performance with the New York Philharmonic (Teldec)."
1,"Thank you for the full price, Decca !","The one above shown is not a rating of the performance , which has been widely praised for both interpretation and sound, but it's a rating of Decca' behavior. This is a reissue of a mid-80's release with an updated, glossy booklet, astutely echoingthe graphics of the recent 6th with the Concertgebouw ! Even worse, it was already re-issued in the budget series Eclipse (around 7 $!) AND with a Mahler fill-up. That series has widely circulated in Europe but I have to admit that I don't know if it was ever issued in the US. Still, if this is an example of the label policies now that Decca has been taken over by Universal Music, well, bad times are coming."
3,Good book - one big beef,"This book has one major fault which brings down its readability. It has the code in a box, but then describes the code in step-by-step instructions. This step-by-step repeats major portions of the code, so you're getting the same thing twice, spread out over various pages. Real ugly. The step-by-step approach works well for Castro's HTML book, but not for a real programming book."
4,Good introduction to PHP and MySQL,Very clear and consise and great examples that you can easily translate to work you're doing.I already have half a dozen ideas for some sites I'm working on now.One minor (actually major) quibble. Could we have at least used current HTML standards in the examples in the book? I mean tables have been depreciated for at least a couple of years now...
2,Out of Date. Wait for next edition,"Some of the code in this book no longer works with newer versions of PHP. Also, it doesn't cover the object oriented additions in PHP 5. Wait until these are added before buying this book."
4,Pretty good,"This is a decent book. It does provide some answers, but not as many as i was hoping to find."
2,Nice Basic. For Beginners + ONLY,Great for begginers. I personally think it's good for begginers but still there are some functions that aren't explaind that well. there are some moments when you can find yourself frustrated.also some parts are too summarized and some too expanded.I won't recommend it so much. You should buy anotherbook that edited better.
5,Good start to learn PHP/MySQL from beginning until Advance,"I gain great experience in learning PHP/MySQL using the book. I love it very much. Now, I have adequate knowledge and skills to develop a web application."
5,Excellent Choice for Intermediate,"The book is very easy to follow and has helped me enormously in just a few days. I am able to put it away for a week and pick up right where I left off without having to relearn everything.Although I know html, I was stumped with working on my database and setting up the login/registration page. The searches I did online only confused matters. Once I started working with this book, the lightbulb went on above my head, ""I get it!""Simple enough for most people to understand, the diagrams support the text and make for easy learning. Definitely would recommend this book."
2,"Lots of pages, low on advanced content.","This is a huge book, approximately 665 pages, however it is quite hard to find anything of help in it. It's great if you are going to go through and do all of the examples, I'm sure you would learn something from it, but it's terrible when you want a quick answer, or you really need to know the details on something. I frequently find myself searching the net instead of this book because it is huge and there is no good way to find the answers. Additionally, when you do find the answers it is just a continuation of a previous example and does not explain in depth on how to use the various functions and such.In conclusion, it's probably just fine if you are a student and want to go page by page and read the book and learn by examples. But it's terrible as a quick reference, and for more advanced users needing in-depth information you should look elsewhere."
5,Wow......,"I don't usually rate books but after finishing Larry's I felt compelled to. I am in the closing pages now and must say it is hands down the best book I've read on PHP and MySql. I really bought this book to try and understand PHP-Nuke (a content management system) and the coding behind it. Now when I look through the php files for nuke I don't feel so lost and confused. If you get stuck on anything in the book, there is a very nice forum where Larry himself often visits and answers questions.Bottom Line: Very efficient code and coding style, Excellent descriptions for every page (including the WAY he explains them), very useful project files (creates a basic e commerce site!), and superb support. You will not be dissappointed."
5,Incredible book! Must buy for anyone learning PHP/MySQL!,"I bought this book and since I started reading it, it's done nothing short of amaze me with how clearly and efficiently it teaches the important basics of PHP and MySQL web development. Most books tend to get bogged down on details such as escape sequences; this book mentions these asides when they should be mentioned, explains how to work with them, and moves on without boring the reader.I'm a programmer in college with more of a C/C++ background. I picked up this book on Tuesday night having coded exactly two PHP scripts in my lifetime, and with no experience with MySQL. By midday Saturday (today) I launched a website for my dorm, coded from scratch.As I said, this is simply an amazing book. A must-have for any budding web developer!"
3,Love this artist--not so much this CD,"Deva Premal is one of my favorites. While this CD is okay, it is too repetitious of two other of her CD's. I should have paid more attention to the songs lusted."
4,peaceful and enchanting..powerful,I found the music to be healing. You will feel more connected with humanity as it has a multicultural beauty. Enchanting use of voice and unique musical instruments.
5,Simply the best...........,"My yoga teacher in Boulder used tracks from this CD extensively in his yoga classes. I am so happy to have stumbled upon this CD! It quiets the mind guides you to an amazing place whether your practice is yoga, or quiet contemplation."
3,Good Album...,"This is a very nice album. I enjoyed it a lot. Still not the best for my money, however. I would much rather listen to Zade's new self titled album. That's what I call art. Zade is AMAZING. Deva is just pretty good. That's my opinion."
5,Fantastic!,"This is one of my favorite CDs for yoga, resting, and dancing. I have lost my current copy! I need to get another, as my collection is off without it!"
1,Help,I Just purchused the essence and as I started downloading it the computer turned of so how do I get the album now Please help or give me credit so i can get it again thanks
3,Sociology 100,"This book acts as a good introduction for Sociology students. Discusses cultural practices, society's definition of norms and how they are upheld and how individuals are viewed and persecuted who deviate. It covers characterizations and practices of social interworkings from a base human perspective to a legal perspective. It was one of my college 100 course books that I found to be interesting and discussable amongst my peers."
4,Book Purchase,The book I ordered was in reasonable condition and the shipping time was adequate. Their description of the book was accurate. I would definately buy from them again.
1,As deep as a puddle,"I'd always enjoyed Matthews via his column or appearances on the McLaughlin show...this book however is fluff. After the fine biography he put forth in Kennedy & Nixon Matthews obviously took note of the loot O'Reilly pulled in and figured to get in on it. His chapters are extremely short and the analysis the same. Saying nothing at all new about either Al Gore or Bill Clinton, I found his pages on his childhood actually more interesting. Sad to say that was merely because the other chapters were so bad. A book that adds nothing to any debate goin on anywhere."
2,He can do better than this...,"I've been watching Matthews since early '99, and really appreciate his show. He keeps things moving, cuts straight to tough questions, appreciates how personal and social psychology have a major role to play in politics, deftly mixes humor with intense conversation, and is entirely intolerant of talking points.Unfortunately, this book contains almost none of that personality.Instead, Chris has produced a quick read of generally unprovocative ideas. Each chapter ends with, ""Let me tell you what I really think..."". So, what, everything before the finale was just baloney? What if he started each chapter with what he really thinks, and then spent the subsequent pages elaborating and deepening those ideas.Frankly, the whole thing smacks of a TV tie-in.I wouldn't dismiss Matthews outright -- his book Hardball is a real gem (read it, if you haven't), and the show still gets interesting here and there.But this book is thin on insight, and long on fancy footwork."
3,At Least You Can't Hear Him,"A few years ago, it seemed like every single stand-up comic was putting out a ""book."" These ""books"" weren't much more than their stage acts put in text form, in a conversational, rather than literary, style.This year, it seems like political talk show hosts are doing the same. Of course, at least these guys have something to say.Matthews's book is a bit better than most because he is, after all, a newspaper columnist and has some sense of language. And in this book he takes a step back from his blowhard teevee persona back to the earlier, gentler, more thoughtful Chris Matthews -- at times.The rest of the time, it's just a readable monologue from yet another pundit -- a smart one, but a blatherer nonetheless. Why bother reading, when it's on television every night?"
1,here's what i REALLY think,"When Chris Matthews wants to tell me what he really thinks, it makes me think he hasn't been telling what he really thought before, or else, why write a book about it. It makes me think I've been duped......It's sort of like starting a sentence, ""To be honest...,"" because if you are honest all the time you don't need to preface what you say by starting ""to be honest."""
1,Shallow,"This book confirms that Chris Matthews is shallow, just like his estimation of the American public. Wasted my time on a hollow book by a below average writer."
2,I Wish You Hadn't,"I always wondered where this entertaining, though elusive pundit really stood on issues. After reading his book, I wish I hadn't. I liken the experience to a big, ripe apple that tastes like water and chemicals once you've actually taken a bite.Chris Matthews is everything Americans seem to be drawn to -- sharp, attractive, exhilarating -- with nothing inside. Though, refreshingly free from ideological rhetoric (which is what attracted me to him in the first place), I found nothing more than a thoughtless nationalism, based on sentimental reverie.Chris Matthews: just another baby boomer, moved by his times, then watered down to nothing by the years that followed."
2,This is not a worthy follow up to Hardball,"If I only cared. My brother bought me this autographed book for my 27th birthday. Like him, I was looking forward to a follow up to Hardball, which I had thoroughly enjoyed. Unfortunately, this book just rambled on listing various people and subjects with some background and then what he really thinks about them. Whew, now I can go on with my life, I know what Chris Mathews really thinks about aids in Africa. This book is only for the most die hard Mathews fans."
3,And now I'll tell you what I really think,"I love Chris Matthews. I love Hardball. I didn't particularly care for this book. Sadly I was really disappointed with his words. I had put this book on my wish list for the holidays and was fortunate enough to receive it. I read it. I let it sit. I read it again. My opinion didn't change. He has always seemed so straightforward, yet by his own words, he contradicts himself in his book. We are of the same generation - actually very near each other in age - and I particularly didn't care for his generalization of boomer experience. I really felt he was above such things, but he proved that wrong in this book. I hope to goodness not all of my generation - especially those who actually enlisted and ended up in a war zone, rather than finding an alternative - are lumped together with Mr. Matthews. The book is good reading for his fans who believe every single thing he says, but for those who were looking for deeper opinion, it is sorely lacking."
1,disappointing,"This was pretty crap to be honest. I should have read it when I was a kid, like I read all the rest, when I wasn't so critical. In a similar vein, the last of the Father Brown books (""The wisdom of..."") wasn't as good as I remembered the others being. On the other hand, the Sherlock Holmes novels are all as strong as Hound of the Baskervilles."
5,musician,"as expected, the music on this album was great. great musicianship despite the poor quality of the mix."
5,Amazing combination of players,"One of my favorite albums to drive with. I got to know this particular performance via videos posted on youtube of the DVD, and the passion and musicianship between these two bands are amazing. The back half of the CD where they play the greatest hits is particularly good and I think the new version of Asayake with the sax lead is the best they've done yet. If you're unfamiliar just do some youtube watching of Casiopea and The Square (early 80's, or this 2004 performance) and I think you'll be hooked."
3,"Great content, terrible editing","I love the Forensic Files TV program and very much enjoyed the book. It's a great behind-the-scenes look at one of the most compelling shows on television.Unfortunately something went wrong with the printing of the book. Some of the pages are transposed, and it's laced with typos. I contacted the publisher and found out that a flawed 'sample' copy had been sent out to some stores.You might want to say something when you buy the book and see if the bookstore can take care of this for you. The best way to tell is to check around pages 111, 112, and 113. They are tranposed. If you see this ask the bookstore to get you the correct copy.The mixup is a shame, because the book is very interesting. Such a poor job by the publisher does a disservice to the authors and to a show that prides itself on detail and accuracy."

5,Great read!,"In addition to the great plot and characterization mentioned by other reviewers, I found Morgan's writing style graceful. That's the first word that come's to mind when I think of this book. Her treatment of characters with questionable(?) motives and behavior is objective; their redeeming qualities are also presented. She reveals the beauty of each person and their role in an almost incestuous community. Her careful treatment of her characters and the skills they build to survive in the weather, community, various types of deprivation is as graceful as her prose."
1,A Poor Choice,I got this because I wanted a key ring that was both small and easy to get keys on and off. The problem is that it's WAY too easy to do the latter. Within two weeks the clasp had already come unscrewed in my pocket several times. Each time keys fell off. Lame.
4,Beautiful,These ornate and substantial switch plate covers look lovely in my Victorian home. They were exactly as described. I also like that they are made of heavy metal and they feel and look expensive. Nice craftsmanship.
1,sigh!!!! I got 2 N75 both of them are no working now and need replacement....please dont buy n75 .,sigh!!!! I got 2 N75 both of them are no working now and need replacement....please dont buy n75 .
5,Darling Shoes!,I bought these shoes for my daughter and they are really cute! She loves them and has received a lot of compliments!
4,Love is Chemicals gets the whole Indie thing,"I am not one to purchase an album on iTunes or Amazon to put it plainly- buy any music whatsoever. In fact, the thought has never crossed my mind in this day of the all encompassing torrent.Until that is, today when my Pandora station (The Shins) played ""Everyone Is In On It"" by the Love is Chemicals.It took me all but 2 minutes to buy the album and load it on my iPhone. The orchestration is tight with the vocals lightly floating above a talent which , I am surprised to see has not broken out on most Indie stations or blogs.This album has passed the ""I like more than 3 songs test..""Buy it!"
4,Book Review,"This is an excellent price for a great book. I have already started to gain more energy. I saw this book at Jamba Juice for $5 more than what I paid through Amazon and Amazon shipped for free, great choice ,very happy."
5,Awesome!!,I love this book.. very good for your sorting out who or what you do notneed in your life.
2,buy it used,Common sense on steroids.Recommended if you have a lot of free time and like to read about things you probably already know. I stopped reading after the first 40 pages.
2,good premise but annoying to read,"The book promises much but delivers little that is new, although the format is clever. I might have been willing to read it as the chapters are short and end with concise ""Action Steps,"" but the sentence structure and grammar are so bad that I couldn't stand it. I found myself too irritated with the author's poor command of written English to pay attention to his information. Note to Jon Gordon: Take a crash course on sentence structure and comma use, or find yourself a good proofreader."
2,Read a Health magazine and get the same info,ANY health or fitness magazine offers the same info in each issue. I'd just get a magazine subscription instead.
2,Okay if 2 out of 4 works for you.,"Very well packed, but two out of four bulbs were broken. Glass was intact but you could shake them and hear they were bad. Sure enough they didn't work. You take your chances. Your mileage may vary. Have bought a number of bulbs online, and this is the first time it didn't work out."
1,don't waste your money,i just viewed this video. it is of the worst quality i've ever seen. obviously someone has taped golf tournaments off their tv set and edited this video together. it is so out of focus it is difficult to see what is going on. there is no audio except for some music. they don;t tell you who the golfer is or what they're doing. i'm sending my tape back for a refund.
1,Looks fancy but nothing special.,"Aside from sitting on it for the initial claiming period, this hasn't gotten much use. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone. A full grown cat can't really use this for it's intended purpose of scratching because it has no stability. It moves. Once a cat senses movement, it is completely turned off. At which point this becomes useless."
1,Errors,"Unbelievable that Mr Nedoroscik's biography states that he studied at the American University in Cairo.That makes it more shocking that simple expressions, which he quotes, for example, upon visiting Umm Kulthum's tomb - are in execrable transliterations: kowcap sharik (i.e. kawkab al sharq) and sitt al khoal (sitt al kull).Heavens."
4,Read this many years ago as part of a course,"It was like meeting an old friend again. Different perspectives to think over by a variety of recognized professionals. My question is whether the intervening years has done much to resolve the controversy. Most, if not all of the issues are still pertinent today."
3,It's ok....,I bought this game and beat it after 2-3 days. I played it several times on all different difficulties and unlocked everything. It was good while it lasted but it was way too short.
2,Boring and Drabby,"I played this game when it first came out abd I was expecting something fun and exciting. Instead, what I got was a walk and shoot, walk and shoot type of game. That's all you do in this game. You walk, crouch, shoot, wait for animated cutscenes and that's it. There's no creativity to this game. No challange. No nothing. This game is boring with a capital B. Ypu'll tire of this quickly and demanding your moeny back. If you do like this series though, you should get it as a rental or as a used game.The graphics aren't even that good. This game was made like the developers were drunk or in a hurry. Plus, they decided that it's a good way to make money but word of advice: If the console versions flop don't attmept to recoup losses by putting the failure on to a handheld because that's just low especially when you charge $50 for it."
1,PSP still hasn't come out with a quality game(This is no exception),"I got this game the day it came out, hoping it would live up to all the media hype, I was mistaken big timeDead to rights: reckoning is BAD, all you do is RUN AROUND AND SHOOT SOME GUYS 50 TIMES TILL THEY DIE, also after a while, the game gets repetitive, you shoot people, then a boss, then some of the boss' back ups. When you hide behind things, it does no good too"
2,wow man soo short,wow im shocked on how short it was it took one hour to finish it on normal and the controls are sloppy i was getting pi**ed off of this game but the graphics are good but it is kind of fun when you get the hang of it! im going to all the good things about it:1.graphics are good!2.sound is o.k.!now im going to say the worst things about this1.controls are sloppy/crap!2.too short no mini games!3.gameplay sucks but kind of good sometimes when you just wanna play a shooter!4.price on it for a short game like this! there going to be bankrupt!5.music sucks! but the sound off guns going off is good!pretty much this game sucks no need to get it but dead to rights fans maybe like this if they have a psp!graphics 4/10 its good for a game like this!sound 5/10 sound of guns going off is way better but music sucksgameplay 4/10 kind of fun sometimes when you just wanna play a shooter!controls 1/10 sucks soo sloppy!overall=3.2 i think this is the lowest game i had evered reviewed!
3,A fun game but with some flaws,"Well, another new game has arrived for the psp and at first I was really excited about this one. The graphics look great, the sound is good, and overall the gameplay is alot of fun blasting enemies in a slow motion bullet time dive. The controls are pretty good but for only having one analog nub the camera isn't as bad as you might think. But for all those considering buying this game, be warned that it is extremely short. I normally take my time playing new games that I buy but I was able to beat this game right away. Sure you can unlock new multiplayer levels and skins but since none of my friends own this, there is little incentive for me to go for that. Hopefully we will get another sequel or something down the road with a longer story because that is all it would have took for me to fully recommend this game."
3,"Good graphics and ok controls, but storyline gets old quick","I was really impressed when I picked up this game. The graphics are really good and it *looked* like it would be cool. But every mission seems to be about the same. Go around, press the x button (to shoot) a bunch of times and maybe send the dog once or twice. Yawn. But the graphics are good and it is fun - it just seems like the same thing over and over. Very linear gameplay, the indicators always tell you where to go. Controls are a little awkward, sometimes I can get him to aim where I want him, and sometimes the dog just won't go when I send him.So overall...decent game...is it worth $40? Depends on what $40 is worth to you. I was hoping for better."
1,Boring & short,"Bought it used for $7.99 at a local game shop.Hard to control,not very entertaining,and just kinda boring overall.It was a waste of $$ at $7.99-even used."
5,Great Book,I loved this whole series. May the Bible stories come alive. I recommend it to anyone who wants to remember Bible characters and their nature.
5,Among the gods,"Chronicles of the king book 5 among the gods is the last in the series, and I will miss these book they are written very well and lynn austin follows the bible."
3,Loved this series but have 1 problem,"I loved the series, ""Chronicles of the Kings"" But I am very disappointed that #5 is not in the Kindle eddition.I do not buy paper books anymore. So if I cannot get the book in an e-reader I do not buy it.So sad that I will be missing this last episode. From now on if her books are not all e-readers I will notstart reading that series!"
2,Wish I'd saved my money on this one,"After reading all of the customer reviews, I had high hopes that ""Among the Gods"" would be as wonderful as the recommendations stated. I was disappointed in that the writing style was pedantic, preachy and historically inaccurate in the most distressing places. The character's vocabulary was stilted and the use of euphemisms irritating. I have read many books by this author, and was not looking for great literature but a ""good read"". I was also disappointed that Ms. Austin, nor her publisher, caught the misquotations from the Bible in two of the chapters.I would not recommend this book to my friends."
5,Love it,Absolutely loved the whole series! I will definitely look into her other books. She brings Old Testament stories so we can relate to them.
5,Fascinating story!,I truly enjoyed Among the Gods. I could hardly put it down. It is well written and I have loved every book in this series. I read the book in 2 days because I got so caught up in the story.
5,"Faith stirring, thought provoking and deeply moving!","I have tremendously enjoyed every single one these books in 'Chronicles of the Kings' and am very grateful to Christian authors such as Lynn Austin who bring these biblical characters to life with such gripping and moving storytelling that bring you back into a time of what it might have been like during those ages. I felt all the emotions of the characters from crying with them, being angry with them, cringing with them, forgiving with them and rejoicing with them. These books were thought provoking and stirred my faith to examine myself to forgive, to trust and to thank God despite the situation. Our God is truly a forgiving and merciful God!I highly recommend all these books!"
5,This series is worth the read,"This is the last book in the series, and it is a very good one. I definitely recommend the whole series to all."
4,Unbelievable...,I'm so surprise I can get this book since I got Amazon notice have stock for me to order..... being this is already two years ago..... and 50th Anniversary Edition......This book is really really fun and make me more more understand the Guinness Records.....I'm very high recommand this book in your library.....
2,"Recommended for ""banana"" families","The author is a Chinese Malaysia and the book is full of nice photographs and drawings. Many ""bananas"" (yellow outside, white inside; speaking only English and can't speak Mandarin) of the Chinese disapora wanting to re-connect with their roots will find it informative. Also useful as pre-trip reading for long-term travellers to China but for academic purposes, it's of little value as there're other more in-depth books."
4,Great,"Without wasting my time giving an aivd description of how the movie and books affected me, I shall simply say that they are enjoyable by anyone with imagination and a love of the exotic. For those who fit the criterea, it's worth every penny"
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"poor argument + boring dialogs + bad characterization + bizarre sex scenes = AVOID AT ALL COSTS.I feel sorry for Catherine Breillat, she must be desperate to get some attention. She should let Rocco direct abizarre sex movie and she could take a part in it, for sure we all would enjoy it 10 times more than this crap."
1,"A book I reccommend being skipped over. Skimpy, wrong information......","I am not sure why others seem to prefer this companion book to the other far better written and informative one by Susan Hansson.This is as boring as basic as it gets. A waste of time and money. Strange layout and design. The Penatcles are treated as having ONLY to do with money, jobs, careers etc. A very shallow and lackluster view on this deeply profound and spiritual suit.This isn't even a true companion book to the Hanson-Roberts. All she does is use the card pictures. That't IT. Oh and a mention about the ""All the Believers"" card.Really if you are a true lover of the Hanson-Roberts than skip this book and get the one by Susan Hansson (it's the one that comes packaged with the deck as a set, that you should tell you something)."
5,Fast Wax is exactly that!,"Some of you wash, dry, then wax with it... try washing, spray it on your car while it is still wet then dry it with a towel. It still looks great and saves a little time too."
3,This is a great product and price,"Works good, but seems to wear off fast on the shine and durability... i would go with liquid glass instead,,, easier to apply and remove, lasts longer, but also costs 4x as much as rainX..."
5,Top Notch Product.,"I've used FAST WAX for about 10 years, twice per year and my vehicles look like new. I also always hand wash my vehicles. Never had them in a garage."
2,Swing and a miss...,"The tape looks great, it stands out well against a fingerboard, and I like the width to promote accurate finger placement.However.Every instrument that I have put this tape on has had to be retaped, or in many cases scotch tape has had to be added to hold the ends of this tape in place. I don't know why the adhesive is so weak, but it is not strong enough to keep the tape in place, especially at the ends. I will be looking for a different fingerboard tape for the next school year."
1,Doesn't stick,"As others have written, the tape doesn't stick. I have 220 elementary school string players and am now having to retape all their instruments."
3,Cats play with it from time to time,Doesn't seem to keep the catnip smell for very long as the cats don't go back to it like they do other catnip filled toys. Maybe it's the size (bigger than it appears online).
4,A quick fix for any problem in your game.,"If I'm slicing, I can look it up in the book and find at least three things that might be causing it. If my chipping is off, I can find out how to build better aim. This book is great, with lots of little things to work on while practicing. For once, someone to tell me how to LEARN the game, not just master it"
2,"Misleading title, very odd book","This is a book for high handicappers or beginners...maybe. There was not much of value in the book for a golfer trying to shoot below 80. Some really poor golfers are given as examples. If I practiced a lot and still shot 105, I would try another game!"
5,An Aesthetics Bible!,"Yanagi's words are so dense, packed, and rich with meaning. He has keen insights into what real 'seeing' is, and how necessary it is in discerning beauty. But Yanagi's words run beyond insight, and have some of that deep ring of eternal 'Truth' to them. I highly recommmend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about what true 'seeing' is, and how it relates to the perception of beauty."
5,The Monster Under My Bed,"This is a good book for beginners. I loved this book whan i was young and im sure others will to. It has alot of words that will challenge kids to read but in a fun way. Also most of hte words are used more thatn once, which makes it good."
5,Great Bank,"Wonderful tool to help even small children understand saving, spending and tithing. We bought one for a 3 year old and a 5 year old. They both love the bank and understand how to use it."
4,"Good bank, no surprises","Just a basic bank, what came in the box is just like the picture and description - a bank with three slots in it. The stickers came on a sheet that you had to peel off and stick on the bank, and they were a little hard to get off, but then again, maybe I'm sticker-challenged!"
2,Mom & Dad really don't like this bank!!,"My three oldest (6, 5, and 2) each received one of these from their Aunt for Christmas. Putting the stickers on was about 5 minutes of fun, then came the noise. Oh, the noise. I realize that any bank that isn't made of material or paper is going to be noisy, but these are...awful. Add to that the plugs on the bottom of each compartment are nearly impossible to remove (even for the grown-ups). And, strangely enough, pennies and dimes get caught in the seams at the bottom of the compartments; that's just bad design. Also, the stickers have already started peeling, making the banks look ugly.I'm currently waiting for an order I placed for three Moonjar Classic banks from amazon to replace these banks. While they might not be quieter, I expect them to be easier to get into and to be of a higher quality both in design and build."
4,Good teaching tool,"A good tool for teaching your kids how to give, save and spend wisely. I bought this for my 8yr. old and she loves it. I plan on passing it on to my younger kids when they are old enough to understand how to be good stewards of thier money. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to teach the biblical model for spending the money God has entrusted to us."
5,Just What I Wanted & Needed,I have to have these books for Girl Scouting. Cost $20 from the Council. Bought them here for under $1.00. Life is good.
2,Waste of money,"It's just a fluffy piece of ""literature"" that tells girls to be nice. Girl Scouts already know this. I wouldn't waste my money on it again."
4,Great Brownie Instruction,Great guide to working on badges. Many ideas available for different projects. Information on guiding history was also interesting. Would recommend to anyone interesd in guiding.
2,Cute but cheap,"This bracelet is very cute in person, but straight out of the package, there were some dents and scratches. I wore the bracelet only a few times and now there are several major scratches that reveal dark metal underneath. This is a nice piece of 'junk jewelry' and nothing more. I would not buy this as a gift for someone, as the top coat of metal will likely chip away the first few times they wear it."
1,poor quality item,Gave this item to my daughter as a gift for Xmas. She loved it! The problem is that it worked for exactly 7 days. That's it. Very poor quality product.
3,Grinning while bearing it,"""What to Know When She's Expecting"" gives the dad-to-be a humorous look at what's going to happen as the little bundle of joy and grief comes. My wife and I were just graced with our first-born, and I wish I had read a little more of this book before she popped out.The humor is made by its absurbity. Just the first chapter about ""is she pregnant"" sets the tone for the rest of the book. Don't expect detailed, scientific accounts and descriptions of the pregnancy and birthing processes. Expect some revelant information with a delirious spin attached.My advice, go ahead and read it, and have fun. Life is stressful enough, so enjoy the tidbits as you can."
4,Abbott & Costello Movie Detail,"This book gives you all the background you could ask for regarding A&C;'s movies. If you are a fan, this book will really put you in the late 30's all the way thru the middle 50's, when they were the king of comedy and the world's highest paid entertainers.Every movie they ever made is richly detailed.Worth a read."
1,An overload to be overlooked,"I was sorely disappointed with this book. The quality of the paper is bad. The pages are like Pringles chips. The photographs, while rare indeed, are printed the size of postage stamps, and the book is simply a dry read. There is a lot of research in here, suitable if you were going to catalog every move Abbott and Costello made, and every bowel movement they ever took. But it's too much. The writing style is uninteresting and catalog-like. As an avid collector and fan of Bud and Lou, I was expecting so much more from the authors. It looks like a ripoff of a much better book by Cox/Lofflin: ""The Abbott & Costello Story."" You'd be better off buying that book. At least it has better pictures and a more well-rounded approach."
5,Woah....,"This is, without a doubt, the most bizarre version of the Bach Cello Suites I have ever heard. It is ultra-romanticized, with thick vibrato and tempi choices I've never heard before.But, it's really, really, really good. Not my favorite, that (ironically) goes to this CD's antithesis, the Pierre Fournier version.But there's an interesting point to be made, in that both of these versions are amazing and equally valid. We don't know what Bach would have wanted the pieces to sound like - maybe if he had access to modern instruments he'd want romantic, maybe not.Either way, this set is well-performed, beautiful, and dance-like. Give it a shot"
5,Great gift for men,"I love the Williams Sonoma series of cookbooks, and purchased three of the Grilling book as Christmas gifts for men. They were THRILLED to receive such a nice cookbook, and one immediately asked me to choose a recipe for him to make for us the next time we're over. It has beautiful, enticing photos, and it's not big or overwhelming. Sometimes it's hard to find gifts for guys, but this one was a hit."
5,very cute cake!,Love this pan! I have made 2 so far and both came out of the pan great. My granddaughters really like them.
5,Great pan!,"I followed other reviewer's advice and used a non-stick spray with flour in it, and it worked great! Even with a thick, lumpy cake (lots of jumbo chocolate chips) the details were not lost. I used this for my father-in-law's birthday cake and it was a big hit!"
5,castle cake,I used this cake pan to make a castle birthday cake. It worked very well and the cake was a hit. I greased and floured the pan like crazy and it came out with no trouble. I used decorator icing to just outline the details of the mold and the cake looked super cute. It earned ooohs and ahhhs from the four year olds at the party.Just be aware the cake is not that big. It technically is not even one full box of store bought mix. However I put one whole box of cake mix in and it fit and did not bake over. The pan is a pain in the butt to clean. I recommend a SOFT toothbrush.
5,Show stopper,This makes a beautiful cake that will wow kids and adults alike.I spray pan well with Pam or Baker's Joy and have no problem with cake slipping right out in tact. Great detail and fun to decorate. Worth every penny.
4,Talk of the party,"I bought this pan for making a novelty version of my Caribean rum cake to take to party's, it was a huge hit. Only thing wrong was that no one wanted to be the first to cut into the awesome looking cake!I was wondering how the cake was going to come out of the pan after baking but it was no problem after spraying and flouring the pan before baking it. This would be a great pan to use for childrens birthday parties as well. Add some flags to the towers and your good to go!"
2,Castle Bundt Pan,"I have this bundt pan and the cathedral bundt pan from Nordic Ware. I have made several cakes in each, and I would definitely recommend the Cathedral one over this one. This one is very small. As I write this review, one-third of my cake batter is burning onto my oven. The first time this happened, I figured it was a heavy, apple cake, and that was the reason it almost overflowed. This is a pound cake, made for a birthday celebration. If it actually makes it out of the pan it will probably sink in the center. Do not, I repeat, do not fill this cake pan with the amount you would normally fill your average bundt pan. It will make a mess! Other than that, it's a cute pan."
1,Too small,Very cute but the pan is small... you would have to make like three cakes for one box of mix. VERY disappointed!
4,castle cake pan,"have not actually used it yet, but sure it will be great - great quality product -fun and professional quality, thanks"
1,By far a very unadequate textbook,"As a freshman in high school, I was very excited to be taking precalculus. But as the year unfolded, so did the many pages of my textbook, and I was dissapointed. Though it does provide many challenging problems, and many examples with graphics, I was unfortunate enough to have to drudge through the year always correcting the Teacher's Edition. On average, about 5-7 problems in every section were wrong in this particular textbook. In addition, There were many gramatical and numerical errors in explanations that were both superfluous and uninformative. The begging of each section had about 10-15 pages of explanation for that section alone. Additionally, the formating and small text were both confusing and intimidating. Overall, this textbook was far worse that I anticipated. This was both the first and the last year in which my school purchased this textbook, and anyone looking for a boring and less than adequate textbook: be my guest and waste your money."
5,Great Book!!!,"I love this book! Everything From Football to the Poker Dogs, and all manly topics in between."
1,not what I was execting,I ordered this book for a Christmas gift which was listed in good condition - very upset to find throughout the book there were personal notes written on photos and an inscription written on the front cover. The book in this condition was useless as a gift. I won't be ordering from this seller again and recommend others to be aware.
4,Testpsterone drips from its pages!,"As the only female in the house, I read this book in self defense. Sure enough John Wayne, poker dogs ( my son collects them) beer, sports and cars are all in here. What I like is that the VonHofann Brothers don't take themselves all that seriously-- ps my boys also bowl and fight over who will drive the truck. This book sums up modern day manliness!"
3,Expected more from it.,"Yes, I ordered this pop-up clothes hamper and it did not last long. Made of poor quality and fell apart really fast. Too bad, it's a nice hamper."
1,quality of book,"I had seen this book that a friend had. I then ordered one for myself and a friend. When the books came, I was disappointed in the quality of the printing. The pages were not glossy and the color was very muted. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY (of new books.)"
1,Not for a beginner.,I felt like I was looking at computer images in the book. The quilts looked very difficult. I've been quilting for about 8 months. I was not impressed with this book. There are many many books I've already bought that I like much better. I sent this one back. Sorry.
5,One of our favorites!,"As many other reviewers have already said, this is a sweet book. We have been reading this to our daughter (who is now 6) for the past four years. She has actually enjoyed it more as she has gotten older because she anticipates the climax and enjoys the resolution so much more now. She especially loves the illustrations since we bought her a matryoshka (when we were in Russia adopting her) that looks just like her...AND the dolls in this book. She still loves to read this book and asks me to read it aloud whenever parents are invited to come in and read to the class (both in kindergarten and 1st grade). A big hit with our family!"
5,A lovely book.,"I bought this book hot off the presses and sight unseen just because I like matryoshka dolls, and was not disappointed. My five-year-old enjoys it very much also. Both the story and illustrations are high quality. A Russian craftsman makes the nesting doll, then ships it to a toy store America, where the littlest doll is lost. A girl buys the dolls, takes them home, and eventually - accidentally- the littlest doll finds her sisters again in a rather implausible ending. Anyone who has ever loved a matryoshka doll will appreciate the story (those little ones do get lost easily)! The illustrations are brightly colored and realistic. Overall, an appealing book to own or give as a gift."
5,Littlest Matryoshka,"This is a beautiful hardcover book written in english about a set of Russian nesting dolls and their journey to the store and the adventure that takes them on from the littest doll getting lost to being reunited with her sister dolls, any little girl will find the story charming:)"
2,Heavy but not heavy duty,"At first glance this seems to be a sturdy stand with a simple but rugged design, and it almost is. The nuts that the wing nuts use to secure the extensions fell off before I even got it to the jobsite, maybe I had a defective one, but they are just rivnuts and not very sturdy. I used C-clamps instead for awhile but on longer heavier boards the extensions are really wobbly this way. Also the plastic end caps that go into the round support tubes have mostly all fallen out. If you can weld on the nuts like they should have been in the first place this item makes a sturdy, inexpensive but heavy stand."
5,Best choice of the cell biology,"I have read 1st and 2nd edition, it's really very good! You can learn many pieces of new information,technology and concept from this book. I have finished my master biochemistry degree but I still keep reading this book. Trust me, you will be a biochemical expert if you studied this book well!!!"
5,Quiet and Cool,"I'm not sure why other reviews are saying that this case cannot fit large heatsinks. I have a Zalman CNPS9500A LED ""Blooming Onion"" type CPU heatsink, and it does not even come close to touching the side fan. You will have to watch your wires though.I switched to this case from a CM Stacker 830, and the fans that just come with it make the switch totally worth while. The large fans make a lot less noise than the 7 120cm fans I had in my CM case, and they do a better cooling job too in my opinion.The features that are designed in this case are great, if you can afford it, buy it."
5,Heatsink not a problem for QX9650,"Well, after searching for a heatsink that would work in the case and on my motherboard, which ruled out Zalman's 8700 and 9700. I decided to have a look at the heatsink with the QX9650. Just, maybe Intel upgraded their POS heatsink.... To my surprise - They did. Fits the motherboard and low profile for the case. Yea, the build is on. BTW, the heatsink looks a little like the 8700 and it's knock-off's."
1,Warning: do not buy. It is a joke,"Wow, I can't believe how I just have been @#$ over by Stuart Crainer. I bought this eBook because it was so cheap and I thought, well how bad can it be? Oh, it can be! And now I feel completely violated ...Let me be a little bit more specific here: This eBook is merely a brief article. Per book you will get about 10 sentences, so it is pretty useless in terms of information. The 10 titles are basically taken from the ""the ultimate business Library: The greatest books that made Management"" which happen to be also by Stuart Crainer. So in essence he just picked 10 books, summarized them in 10 sentences and published it as an eBook in an attempt to make some quick money.This is now the second time that I bought an eBook on amazon and it was a complete desaster. Stay away from this eBook. You might find better information for free on the web."
4,Used to fuse fireworks.,"I used this tape to fuse fireworks together. It was very effective. I had no problems with its pliability, or adhesiveness. It ripped easily, so that I could make custom length pieces with just bare hands. It is good for fireworks, because it does not melt, thereby extinguishing the fuses."
2,glue not very sticky. don't really recommend,"I bought this for work and compared to 3m it has two disadvantages. The wax paper it's on is difficult to remove and it doesn't stick nearly as well as 3m tape. Seemed like a bargain but in my use it failed. I won't buy it again. It is less than half the price, so if you need to save alot, buy one roll and try it out."
3,Third in Series is Flawed,"Denise is undercover again - this time infiltrating a terrorist group that has, thus far, avoided being infiltrated. To add an additional threat to her life, the woman whose identity she has assumed has a brother who escapes custody at a mental hospital for the criminally insane to kill his sister.I really enjoyed the first two entries in McNab's new series. But this outing seemed . . . well, less. It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it was bordering on tedious in some places and seemed contrived in others. This book didn't move as fast as the others, but it was, nevertheless, a good read.Certainly if you enjoyed the first two, you'll undoubtedly like this one as well."
3,3rd in Series Flawed,"Denise is undercover again - this time infiltrating a terrorist group that has, thus far, avoided being infiltrated. To add an additional threat to her life, the woman whose identity she has assumed has a brother who escapes custody to kill his sister.I really enjoyed the first two entries in McNab's new series. But this outing seemed . . . well, less. It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it was bordering on tedious in some places and seemed contrived in others. This book didn't move as fast as the others, but it was, nevertheless, a good read.Certinly if you enjoyed the first two, you'll undoubtedly like this one as well."
2,Boring and slow,"I find this workout to be boring, slow, and uninspiring. I used it with my first pregnancy eight years ago and recently tried to exercise with it. It is old and outdated. The newer videos for pregnancy workout feature a fun aerobics segment which this workout omits. Some of the techniques in the exercises do not match what is said on the newer videos today. The newer videos I have found state that they conform with the Guildlines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. I feel safer performing movements that have been deemed okay for pregnant women. Also, in the videos I have, the instructors are pregnant themselves. I highly recommend the Kathy Smith Pregnancy workout along with the Buns of Steel Pregnancy workout.Get both for variety for almost the price of this one video."
3,never done it,"I have never been pregnant before, so I have never done this video, but I have watched it. My mom has done it before and she didn't like it. It looks okay, but it is almost as if Jane Fonda thought that as long as there were not any aerobics and no ab work, it would be perfect for pregnant women. First there is a workout for pregnant womwn and women recovering from pregnancy. Then there is an extra floor workout for women recovering from a pregnancy. Then a women named Femmy DeLyser shows you birthing tips and at the end of the video there is a section on baby care."
4,Great for Beginners!,"This DVD is MUCH BETTER than her Peel off the Pounds Pilates DVD. This one is true to title and much easier than Mari Winsor. On a side note I was a little distracted by how hideous Kathy Smith's feet look in this DVD. I think she definately should have sprang for a pedicure prior to doing this. She has old lady wrinkley feet. However, she takes time to explain everything clearly and unlike Mari actually does the exercises she expects you to do. I felt like I got a pretty good light day workout."
3,workout,it's okay to workout with this video if your just beggining or maybe intermediate.this workout is definately is not for the advanced.
4,A decent personal account of the Chinese Revolution.,"From a personal perspective, this is a nice addition to the literature on the Communist takeover of China. It is very informative about America's involvement in both the humanitarian efforts and the military failures of Chiang's regime. The American government pumped in 3.5 billion dollars (1948 dollars) into this failed Nationalist government. This government despite the American aid failed to win over the population and militarily defeat the Communists. In fact, the Communists were non corrupt, brave, and resourceful and this resulted in the defeat of the Nationalists.Rowan watched the corrupt nature of the Nationalist regime, and Chiang's military incompetence. He watched as humanitarian aid was stolen and sold. He watched as Nationalist soldiers threw away their weapons and went over to the enemy. It makes you wonder whether our efforts in Iraq will meet with the same fortune. A nice read of a personal account of the Chinese Revolution."
3,Disappointed.,"If you are like me, looking for an in-depth coverage of the campaigns that determined the fate of China, you will be disappointed. The book wasn't interesting until I was almost half way through it. At times I felt like I was reading ""A Veteran Journalist's Firsthand Account of Himself during the 1949 Chinese Revolution"". The thrilling part of the book was twenty something pages of the Epilogue in which the author takes you on a whirlwind tour of China from 1949 to the Age of Yao Ming. The author's abiding interest in and love of China was quite touching."
3,So so,His other works are better. Well written but plot is weak. Price of thieves is a much better read. Not recommended
3,"Good read, but no ""King of Thieves""","The book definitely holds your attention and certainly has more than a few twists and turns, but almost feels too similar a cousin to the ""King of Thieves"". Certainly a great beach ride for Hogan fans, but not earth-shattering."
2,Killing Moon - More like killing time.,"After reading Prince of Thieves, I become Chuck's No. 1 fan. But his follow-up novel read like a mystery contrived more to outguess the reader than to engross them. Read the fast-paced ""Prince"" , walk away from pedestrian ""Moon""."
3,"The Bride ... followed up from ""Dead men don't wear plaid""","I have been looking for this one for awhile now, not a bad movie - all great characters with some great actors, interesting enough plot with lots of double crossings, I like the scene where Taylor is pulled into the sea whilst fishing.And of course picking out the shots used in DMDWP was fun."
1,A Book with very THIN coverage,"This book is not very detailed, and is not at all comprehensive. It takes a ""broad spectrum"" look at Mennonite life which is to say that it does not cover anything in decent detail. The most liberal ""Mennonites"" are no different than anybody else, and ""Mennonite Life"" is a sort of meaningless term. Old Order Mennonites are all lumped together and not covered well at all."
3,Not Exactly What I Hoped For,"This is a nice bowl to have, but I was hoping that it would be a little bit deeper. My intentions were to use it to actually make my lather in as I now use a coffee mug, but I think it is too shallow for this use. The cake soap is also smaller in circumference so whatever good lather you make winds up getting trapped in the gap between the soap and the bowl. I think it will wind up serving and just a ""holding tank"" for my next cake of soap. It does make a nice appearance in the bathroom though."
2,WAY overpriced for a nearly 40-year-old book...,"I had one previously bad experience with this publisher, Hardinge Simpole, but I chalked it up to a one-time thing. I bought this book and Bent's games and annotations get five stars, of course, but a simple reprint (digital or not, it's JUST a reprint - not even in algebraic format!) doesn't merit a $25 price tag, which knocks off three stars.I doubt I'll ever buy anything from Hardinge Simpole again. If you MUST buy this book, see if you can get the original, older version from a used bookstore or the reprint from one of the many fine sellers here on Amazon. $25 is WAY too much for a nearly 40-year-old book with a new (and a generic, highly unimaginative) cover."
5,Stylish and functional case,"This is very good looking bag.I have dark gray one. The 2 best features are it can stand vertically and a ton of pockets inside it.It can fit my 15.6"" widescreen Vaio and has a pouch for power cord.One design features I like is - the latches for the shoulder sling are covered. You do not see those plastic clasps hanging out. I like that. Zips are good though they are made of plastic. You have enough pockets for cells, cds, portable drive, charger, tickets and some documents. For 15 bucks it is really worth."
4,Awesome,"I am a HUGE white castle fan but I got this as a gift for another. I love this book, it has old time pictures, and stories as well as real recipes that actually sound pretty good. Great gift for any white castle fan out there."
5,This book deserves a place in any precocious kid's library,"This book is a great example of classic old school writing; a whimsical and deep respect for language, a freedom from vulgar pop cultural references, and a love of storytelling that is immediately recognizable. There are many creative details in the story that add much to the book's enjoyment. The art is also very much of a classical age as well. Kompaneyets is a highly skilled painter with an impressive attention to detail. The pictures will inspire awe and wonder in both children and adults.In all respects this is a very finely crafted book. A book children will be able to grow up with and cherish as well as a book their parents will enjoy sharing (very important!). Buy this book today and it won't end up in a yard sale in a couple of years; how many other books in your child's library can you say that about?What else could you want from a children's book?"
5,Not Your Average After School Special,"Teen Truth is an intense documentary that attacks head on the epedemic of violence in school. This is a different kind of educational film, it's not a bunch of adults preaching to kids about what they think causes school violence, it's the kids themselves trying to understand and explain what drives certain teens to act out. Interviews with High School students explore the dynamics 'fitting in' and the anger and sadness that can build when someone isn't let in to the accepted social structure. It's an eye opener for kids who may not think their words and actions make a difference. The film is also a great reminder for adults of how truely important it was as a teenager to feel like you had friends who understood and supported you.This film should be required viewing in all high schools"
3,Not what I thought it would be,"Although this dvd is very insightful as to the circumstances surrounding teen violence and suicide, it offers very little (if any) suggestions for students in those situations. It focuses more on the cause than on the solution. The teens who watch this will gain a sense that they are not alone in being victims, but it offers very little hope that things will ever change. It just wasn't what I expected. Insightful, powerful, yes. A tool for change, no."
5,Nursing Diagnosis Resource,"In the process of developing an article on organizational diagnosis, I ran across the distinction between medical diagnosis (as done by physicians) and nursing diagnosis. The distinction had implications for developing a model of organizational diagnosis. Consequently, I needed a good resource to explain nursing diagnosis. This book not only provided that essential information, but did an excellent job of comparing nursing diagnosis to basic problem solving."
3,Healt &Physical Assessment in nursing- by Barbarito review,"This book is not the best for studying, I recomend the one by Carolyn Jarvis, wich is better."
3,expensive soap and oil,"I was not real impressed with this detergent. It worked OK, but I believe a good grease cutting dish soap would work as well or better. It still took quite a bit of time with hand work and a tooth brush to get the filter clean. I don't know how special the oil is, but it is made for the filter so I used it. It spreads good and made the filter look like it did when I first purchased it."
1,Worst product,"To get the dirt out of the filter, you have to wash it about 3 times, and would not completely be clean. On the contrary, the competitors products, with one application, the filter gets rid of all the dirt."
3,Surprisingly not very outdated,"For fiction written about a cyber world many years ago, this is surprisingly not very outdated. The art is nice, and the story and characters interesting, but the story line and art are a little too chaotic and random for my tastes."
4,"Cheap, washable, my dog loves them","Bought a bunch of these, dog loves them.I like the fact that I can throw them in the wash when they get to dirty.Very reasonable price - for lots of fun"
2,wish ball was bigger,our dog loves to play with balls but is aging and her teeth are having difficulties grabbing the toy; but will continue to search for a more appropriate type for our small Boston Terrier.
3,Less than expected,"There was a doze of self-repeating in the Oxygene 7-13, but that kind of repeating I can always listen to. That was still the authentic Jarre sound. Metamorphosis bring out the vocals and that is supposed to be the fresh and innovative parameter in the Jarre opus (even though there have been all sorts of vocals and vocal-like sounds in the previous albums). Intelligent and melancholic music that is what I am used to when it comes to Jarre. This album goes a bit over that, and in my opinion it is too much. ""Randez-Vouz A Paris"" Would be my favorite track and ""Hey Gagarin"" the weakest. I hope next time Jean-Michel Jarre will go a bit closer to his own style."
2,A Little slow,"I am a little disipointed on this CD. This is nothing like his Oxygene 7-13. In fact this is one of his worst so far. I am a big JMJ fan and I bought this CD on blind loyalty, even with the large price tag. It is very slow and down beat with, get this, voices and singing? I enjoyed JMJ's use of a choir in the past, but this is not the same. Still, if you are a die hard JMJ fan, dont take my word for it, form your own opinion."
3,Not as unique,"This CD lacks of what made Jean-Michel Jarre so famous worldwide. Although the vocals are a refreshing touch, some of the lyrics are silly and a few songs are just boring. Overall, a daring and interesting change by JMJ, but certainly not his best."
2,Beware. No synths here.,"As a musician's musician of electronic music, Jarre's latest work, Metamorphoses, is the very antithesis of electronic or synthesizer music. While musically the album is quite innovative (Je Me Souviens, C'est La Vie,) I bought the album based on the fact that Jarre was (is?) a synthesist who produced Oxygene, Equinoxe, Magnetic Fields, and Zoolook. I understood the album concept, alright: It's not synthesizer music. If anything, I'd categorize it New Age/World music. My rating, therefore, reflects my opinion of the music in general. As a fan who was deeply affected by Oxygene, Equinoxe, Magnetic Fields, and Zoolook though, I was crushed."
3,Stale Cheese,"Too much trendy, new-age, traditional sounding filler, and over contrived vocals. Maybe my expectations are too high of Jarre, but it reminds me too much of artists who were probably influenced by him, rather than the other way around--Enigma, Evoka, Delerium, etc. I rarely play it, but it's still a mediocre addition to the rest of his albums."
1,metamorphoses ?,"i have been waiting for a cd with vocals from jmj from a long time, but i had no idea that it was going to be this weak !jmj was one of the pioneers of electronic music, that i have to admit. since his success and the million dollar concerts, all the extravaganza's i would have hoped that this cd would have had the artists that shaped his career such as christophe, patrick juvet, etc....instead he picked the weather girls ? (or whatever they're called) natacha atlas, laurie anderson.............why ?to be on the top 10 ?if jmj wanted to go back to his roots, i would have thought he would have done a better job at it , what a pity !"
2,Eh... it's just OLD FASHIONED,"Like your parents trying to wear what's hip. It's sorta embarrassing, and really not that hip.Instead, try William Orbit's ""Strange Cargo"" 3 or 4, Supreme Beings of Leisure, Zero 7, Massive Attack's ""100th Window"", or even some recent Crystal Method."
2,Monkeys on Ecstasy could do better....,As a Jarre fan I found this CD disappointing. Zoolook was at the bottom of my list of Jarre's works. This takes its place hands-down. One song (Millions of stars) was cool. The rest were just gawd-awful. Take Lori Anderson on acid and have her sing French Fusion Jazz with what sounds like a drunk Jarre at the keyboards - often using his feet. You get the idea. Skip it. Save the $$$.
4,Comfortable shoes,"These shoes are super-comfortable and pretty. The color is a little more orange than what you can tell on the webpage pic, nevertheless I consider these a great buy"
3,Beautiful but .............,"First of all the desk arrived in 1 large 70 lb. box. It was in 4 pieces, the main top and the four legs that you must attached (but appropriate hardware comes with it). It was a snap to assemble and I am a weak woman in 40's. It also has a couple shelves to attach. The only issues were that there was a crack in the back of the desk and a small scratch on the front. Besides those things, it is a heavyweight gorgeous desk. If I didn't think it would be entirely too much trouble, I would send back (that is what I would normally do), but it is too heavy and I am going to try to fix the problems myself. I know I shouldn't have to do that for the price I paid for it, but again it weighs at least 70 lbs. Not sure that I'll buy furniture only again only because you have non control over any potential problems. If it had arrived with no problems, I would have given it 10 stars."
4,Not long enough!,"I loved the story, but I almost wish it was two different books. The last chapter needed more, I wasn't ready to say goodbye yet!"
4,Good read.,"I bought this because I love Jill Barnett, and while it's not my favorite, it's engaging and humorous.Definitely would recommend it."
4,good read,i was more entertained than i thought i would be. the characters were believable and i found myself caring what happened to them. it is one i will enjoy reading again.
3,Funny,"This was odd for me in that the author did a back & forthing between two different couples. I really enjoyed all the characters. Maybe I'll appreciate her writing more w/ the emphasis placed more on one couple(?) I do plan on reading her other books, if for nothing else but the humor. Good read."
5,Delightfully entertaining,Jill Barnett has a delightgul way of capturing humor. I loved the bantering between Gorgina and MacOaf. Cover to cover this story was a great retreat.
3,Good but deceptive length.,"Awesome HD air-show footage with brilliant color, with very little generic feel to the video. The only problem I find is with the length. Three disks totaling 6hrs 46 mins, which is awesome, but this feature is rife with repeated segments and interviews. By the third disk some segments have played three or more times already, and it starts to get annoying. Could probably have been boiled down somewhat. Overall it was well worth the $7.00 it was marked at."
4,Tasty,"I have no idea if this actually has nutrients in it, but one of my cats will eat it right out of the tube. He likes it a lot."
1,Cat hissed at me when I approached with this!,My cat has lost her teeth due to periodontal disease so I have been searching for a way to get more minerals and nutrients into her diet because all she can eat is wet food. I bought this because of all of the positive reviews. My cat is not picky at all so I thought this would be a great idea. Well as soon as I got it I opened it and tried to get her to smell it. She squinted at me and walked away. I then squirted some on my finger and rubbed it on her nose for her to lick off. Well she was not happy! She ran and hid from me and for the rest of the day hissed at me. When I tried to get her to try it the next day she continued to hiss at me. SHE NEVER HISSES AT ME! Ever! I tried offering it to my blue Russian who will eat anything (including ear swabs) and he ran from me as well. This product is a bust!!
2,Wish it worked...,"I have been trying to find something to mix in with my cat's food. He is on a low protein diet after his kidneys started to fail, and I was really hoping this would work. He doesn't even want to smell the stuff... I guess I will have to keep looking!"
3,Smells Bad And is Greasy,"My cat is 19 and losing weight because he won't eat dry food, or canned cat food. He'll eat tuna, which doesn't provide the fat, and nutrients he needs. Claudius hates this stuff, and sneezes if I bring it near. I am using a syringe for feeding a cat liquid medicine. It is getting the Nutri-Cal into him, and he is eating a bit more, but the clean-up is ridiculous! My fingers get greasy, and Claudius has grease all over his chin, and his front. If you can get this into your finicky cat, they'll get their nutrition. I hope you have a cat that likes this, because that makes it easier."
3,Mislabeled,"My cat is ill and she does like this product, but I have some concerns. The first thing I noticed is that although the tube is labeled ""Nutri-Cal Cat"" on one side, it gives directions for feeding it to dogs. Also, the first ingredient in the product is corn syrup - yuck! Not exactly a nutritional item....."
2,Covered better in other books and mock orals,"This is a decent book but I wouldn't spend the money on it again; the information is also covered in ""Boarding Time"" in an easier to read format. There's nothing incredibly helpful in it, it's just another point of view about how to approach the boards. I passed, but I can't point to any particular helpful information in this book that contributed to my result. If you are studying with friends, buy one copy and pass it around."
5,Whipped.....Yes Please!!,"Faster Pussycat (FP) were one of those bands you either loved or hated. I personally rated them as one of favourites alongside LA Guns. After their successful self-titled debut, released at the same time as Appetite for Destruction and the heavier second album Wake Me When Its Over FP released this little gem. Full of whitty tongue-in-cheek lyrics like Big Dictionary,Madam Ruby's Love Boutique, Catbash and the ever so catchy opener Nonstop to Nowhere whipped has songs for every rock fan. Described as the poor mans G'n R, FP were much, much more even to this day I still have the CD my car stereo. So go on try this you won't be disappointed. Great lyrics, excellent tunes and guiters and bass to kick you in the .... you won't find much better."
5,Very Under-Rated album.,"This is one of the most under-rated cd's out there. I think that this is definately Faster Pussycat's best cd. If you like metal, this one will not let you down. Loose Booty and Mr. Lovedog are just hilarious. My favorite line is in Nonstop to Nowhere, ""dont believe the preachers, they're just sticking out their hands, dont believe the government, who the hell's this uncle sam"""
2,The band lost their momentum.,"Im a huge fan of fasterpussycat so when I got this cd in the mail and played it I was immediately amazed at the lack of good songs on it,I could only hear about 4 good songs on this cd. I have the bands 1st 2 cds and those were both great albums but this album seems like the boys from california just ran out of steam on this there 3rd studio album. I got this cd for pretty cheap so Im not too angry about the cds overall weak tone."
3,"heard better , heard worse.","sorry for a short reviewthe playing is tight but no song stands out .their worst cd but still worth getting but you'll be wearing out your skip button.tracks to play daily 1,3,7,8tracks to play weekly 2,4tracks to play annaully 5,6,9,10.who is the babe in cover?"
4,Emma by Wendy Kesselman,"I read this book to a 4th grade class during Literacy Week after giving them a brief art lesson at their school. Everyone loved the book, including me! There was some doubt as to whether these 10 year olds would think the book was too childish, but it fit right into the art theme and held their attention.I highly recommend this book."
2,Rather uninspiring,"After the book was compared with 'A year in Provence', I was expecting a similarly enjoyable read. I was disappointed though. I struggled to read my way through the book and was glad when I eventually finished it. I was hoping to read of interactions with local French characters but most of the interactions were of fellow foreigners who had settled in the region.Celia also bombards the reader with potted histories of buildings, towns and people. While this may interest some, it became a little tedious reading pages of facts which failed to bring the characters to life for this reader."
5,PENTECOST AFTERSHOCK,Absolutely tremendous inspirational book. You will not be the same after you read it...you will want to draw closer to God!JK
1,"Very,Very thin, cheap looking piece of foam- HATE IT-did not work!!","Talked to the company in length for description. I was sure this was going to be the runner I needed over my carpeted stairs. I have small inside dogs and wanted something that would clean eaisly, but being in my entrance way, it would also have to look nice. This is a cheap piece of very, very, very, thin foam. The only thing I could use this for is a backing under an area rug. It is just too ugly to describe and it does not lay completely flat on stairs. There is always a place not sticking or wrinkled. Pretty expensive for just a days use for movers too. I suggest you run, not walk, away from this one. $50 down the drain."
1,Had been cut,"The product was not in its original condition. While the ad clearly stated the size, the picture misrepresented it, in that it was the manufacturers picture showing it in full size. It was also listed as ""new,"" which it wasn't since it had been cut in half. Would not buy from the seller again."
1,How many one pairs left in stock?,In November I saw this shoe and ordered a 12 EEE and as I indicated I received a Size 12 D shoe in a 12 EEE Box. Thank God they fit my 19 year old son. What is the possibilty that the size available is actually a 12 EEE?
1,ugly,"So disappointed when I received it. The coler is dim and the cloth is lack of dynamic. It is heavy, and warm. But don't hope to wear it when you want to be stylish."
5,Help me pick which book to read next!!,"I have recently finished Over His Dead Body by Leslie Glass and I loved it! I immediately started looking for more of her books, but was unable to decide which one sounded better. So I got three... A Killing Gift, For Love and Money: A Novel of Stocks and Robbers, & Tracking Time.I can't wait to start them all!"
1,Woo are you?,"After having eagerly awaited this book, I can hardly contain my disappointment. This is a bad departure from the April Woo series. And, as others have pointed out, neither is this a mystery. At best, one has a romance, and a rather uninspiring one, at that. No depth, no intrigue. Reminds me of the similarly poor presentation by Evanovich in the Sugar Plum book. So the lady ends up with a new face through plastic surgery and finds out her husband was a cad. Buyer beware, leave this on the shelf."
5,Perfect springtime read,"It seems like no one is writing comic novels anymore. This one comes along just in time. I'm a big fan of Leslie Glass's mystery series, and this new book, although not a police procedural, combines the best elements from her suspense novels with a darkly comic, modern premise. It's a funny, thoughtful page turner. Terrible title, though, and it looks like the publisher spent about six minutes and a dirty nickel on the cover art, but once I got past that I loved it. I'm looking forward to seeing what Glass does next outside her April Woo series."
3,"While I did enjoy it, some things just didn't make sense","About one quarter of the way through this book, I started to scream at the heroine ""get your own attorney, you dimwit!!"" How anyone could be this dumb is truly unbelievable, but then again, I stayed up late to finish it, so go figure. It was worth it just to see the mistress get her just desserts. The children, Marsha and Teddy, are two whiny brats with no appeal whatsoever. There are better books out there about revenge - read Olivia Goldsmith or Jane Heller"
1,Why mess with a winning recipe?,"As my title says, why mess with a winning recipe? Glass had a winner series of Detective April Woo book - witty and thrilling, with great characters. What else would you want in a murder mystery? I was TOTALLY disappointed with this trashy story, bad characters, who cares story line. I bought this book excited that Glass had a new April Woo book out and was undiscribably disappointed - especially because I live in Thailand had my friend bring the book all the way from the US! I recommend to skip this book, but do read her April Woo books, they are excellent! I can't wait for a new one to come out!"

5,Great resource for young capitalists.,"Teen entrepreneur Daryl Bernstein gives the lowdown on over 50 nifty businesses that kids can start. He's come up with products and services that are truly useful -- and marketable. In addition to more traditional leaf raking and snow shoveling ideas, there's birthday party planner, comparison price shopper, photograph organizer, and lots more. Included are details on what supplies kids will need to run each business, what to charge, how to advertise, and special hints to make the venture a success."
2,"Um, Daryl could've done better.","Well, Daryl went a bit short on information. I couldn't start a business just on the stuff he has written. He only wrote a handful of cute paragraphs on each idea. Oh, well. A much better book on the subject is Extra Cach for Kids. (I think right now its out of print.) P.S. I do know what I'm talking about; I have run several businesses."
2,Slow Shipping,"I really should not rate this book as I haven't received it yet. I ordered this book along with 2 others on March 24 and as of today, April 8, they haven't been shipped. My granddaughter is very disappointed, she asks me every day if I received them yet. What a poor way of encouraging children to read!"
5,A book that should be read by all parents,"I've been looking for a book like this for a very long time. We need more of these to be written because it's important for our kids to get involved.Maybe more people should follow the author's lead and do some investigation into how we can get our kids to work at an earlier age.There's another book that I also read that may be of interest to parents and kids alike.It's called Untapped Wealth Discovered and it has some very potent ideas for parents and kids and it talks about how kids can make some very good money because large companies are seeking their expertise.These companies include cereal companies, toy manufactuerers, and video games developers. The second edition in particular has some very good examples.Thank you Barry for writing your book."
5,LET ME SANCTIFY YOU,THE MUSIC AND THE LYRICS WERE SO GREAT THAT THEY GOT ME FEELING SO HIGH THAT I THOUGHT I WAS IN HEAVEN.
1,WARNING - Rape Scene,"I wish one of the other reviewers had mentioned it, for then I wouldn't have wasted my money. I cannot and will not abide this in my escapist entertainment. The real world is full enough of violence toward women.I had been enjoying the experience of reading this book, until it came to a screaching halt - and the book went straight into the trash bin. I hope others of Ms. Grace's books do not and will not include such extreme sexual aggression. I do not care to read it."
2,Give me a break......,"Sorry, I couldn't finish the book. Everything just worked out too perfect. Miles and Cat meet and fall in love, Geoffrey regains his speech and tells Lucy he loves her, Justin and Victoria fall in love; which is what romance is about but this had too much mush and was not well written."
5,Susan Grace is my favorite new author!,"Susan Grace has created a seductive and rich historical saga with a tempestuous romance. I loved it! You will too!"""
3,Ommisions mar this otherwise good book.,"This is a good book that could have been great if the authors would have spent more time updating the information on Delphi 3's new VCL (including to new C/S version). As it stands now, if you have enough money to build a big Delphi library and you are a serious programmer, then you'll probably find occasions when this book will come in handy. Otherwise you will probably be better off spending you money elsewhere."
2,Does not cover the most common components.,"This book has good examples of code and ideas on how to implement the code in your project. That being said, this book does not cover many of the more common components that are availabel in D3. With a title like SUPERIBLE, I was expecting a COMPLETE reference but, more often than not, I am left holding the book in one hand and my problem in the other with absolutly no help coming from the book. As a developer I cannot recommend this book due to the incomplete component reference and the merely cursory look at many of the new components in D3 such as web based components."
3,Brazilian Comments,"I'm a beginner to Delphi 3 and this book is absolutelly not recomended to beginners. When I saw the word ""Bible"" in the title, I thought that it would be recomended to me. I really did not like it. What happens is that when you don't know what to expect, you can't use this book as its style covers every class and every property but doesn't concatenate the ideas, it works more like a syntax reference. Definitelly not recomended for beginners!"
2,"Covers VCL in depth, only scratches the surface of Delphi 3","This book followed the proven Waite Group Layout and covered most of the old VCL components. However, if you are looking for the excellent reference most Waite Group Bibles provide don't look here. New VCLs, functions, and any useful information about Delphi specific messages and exceptions have been left out. This book is a waste of money for all but the beginner to Delphi"
1,"If you have Delphi help files, you don't need this book.","This book is just a poor replica of Delphi documentation. It just talks empty air. It leaves you where you are, without solving the problem or giving you a hint on how to solve it. Now it's a huge book with a great title, but that's just it. The only thing it has that might like you are tiny programs or fraction of code on how to use the components, but you can get better if you surf the internet or look into Delphi's examples in the help files. My suggestion is save your money, or invest it in a better book. I just wasted my money."
5,Great CD!!!!,"There is not a bad song on this CD. These guys have taken pure talent and desire to created a truly awsome collection of music. If you have not gotten it yet, you are missing out."
5,mercman50-houston texas,My daughter was a huge fan of cardinal trait.. So I decided to hear their cd and I was overwhelmed.. their was not one bad song on that whole entire cd.. i absolutly can not wait till the second cd
1,Top movie - I think!?!,"With stars such as Jeannie Slit, Mona Lots and Katrina (no surname) listed in the credits, you know it's going to be a great movie. Watch for the ""sprinkler girl"" murder scene; what thousands of dollars they must have spent on special effects! The video cover tells you the movie lasts 80 minutes or so, but it actually finishes after 45 minutes of top acting, top storyline, and top-notch FX. Another convincing and innovative murder occurs when a sunbathing beauty (with blotchy legs and homely face) gets a bottle of suntan-lotion, plus contents, rammed into her mouth. Of course she fails to hear the murderer approaching from behind, and there's not another soul on the whole of the beach to witness the incident!!! Top acting honours must go to the unseen cop who, at the movie's conclusion, sticks a fake-looking gun out from behind a door and says in a deadpan voice, ""Police!"" I can't emphasise enough what top stuff this is. Buy/rent/steal a copy at your peril."
5,One of the best technical death metal titles ever,"As soon as Anata released this record in 2004, I listened to it...it was unbelievable.Unfortunately, somebody stole my cd carrying bag, and I've lost itBut now, I bought it again.From the beggining, the disc is like a hammer pounding in your head...no stop, and no mercy.Songs like A Problem Yet To be Solved, Entropy Within, or Dance to the song of apathy, make this record ""one of a kind""This should be an obligatory listening to all Death Metal fans, anywhere"
2,misleading,"Well I can see that most everyone else seems to love this book, but I didn't. While it was interesting to read, most of the stories were fairly well-written, and it is of course a good subject to bring attention to, it further perpetuates some myths regarding domestic violence. I understand that the intentions were good and that they're very very common misconceptions, and I used to have them myself, but when you're writing a book like this, I think you need to really research the topic. The main misconception found repeatedly in this book was that domestic abusers simply lose control of their tempers, and that's just not true; it's an excuse.For an understanding of the dynamics of abusive relationships and the motivations of abusive men, the best book to read is called ""Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men"" by Lundy Bancroft. Granted it's not in a story format like this book, but it will give you so much better information."
2,Alright!,This book was a drag. I wish i never ordered it. The meaning is good but it was not for me.
1,Maybe Next Time,"Maybe it's just me, but this book got on my nerves. The stories were boring and a little far-fetched. It was difficult getting through this book, but when I did, I felt I had wasted my time. I hope people are not looking to this book to shed light on domestic violence or offer inspiration to help them overcome a terrible situation, because it's definately not a good source."
3,Zane Fan,"I am a Zane fan. I give it up to her for trying something new. However, Addicted is still my favorite book by Zane. This Can't Be Love! by Patricia Goins is another great book that deals with domestic violence. Unlike Breaking the Cycle, you won't be able to put it down."
1,No comment --,"I can't really comment on this book because I couldn't read it. As much as I love Zane, the short stories are not my thing. I was only able to read the first two stories and had to put it down for good for being pretty depressing."
3,Make you think!,"I have a friend that is going through a abusive relationship, I got her this book, hopefully to get her brain back to thinking. Because now, no matter what i suggest she always end up taking him back. He has totally disrespected her in so many ways that it ain't funny. I also purchased a book for myself so I can read it myself. She was saying how some of the stories just made her break down and cry, but still she keep taking him back. All in all, this is a great book. Also at the end of the book it has resources for abused people. Two thumbs up!"
3,It will do,"This is the first book that involved Zane that I really didnt care for. I was not able to fully get into the book, because the story changed in each chapter, by time the story got good it was over and on to the next very dissapointing"
4,breaking the cycle by Zane,"I really enjoyed this book. If you are someone who is going through an abusive situation, this book will help you find strength to overcome."
3,a bit repetitive,"Ok, some of the stories are indeed good but after a while they become a bit repetitive.This is a book of short stories about domestic violence on different levels. Zane has the first story and hers is pretty good but it kind of goes down hill from there. I love that Zane has stepped away from that raunchy sex stuff for a moment and shows us her versatility. I give the book 3 stars because its worth reading but it won't keep your attention for long periods of time."
4,I'm glad ZANE put this one together!,"I plan on choosing this book for next month's meeting of Tell Me A Story Book Club. We don't normally do short story collections, but since we made one exception this year already, I thought maybe we will try it out for 2007! It is a book that has a very good message. The stories are sad and touching, and each one is different and unique.I am proud of ZANE for putting this project together because they were stories that needed to be told. We all like sex and erotic stories, but sometimes you have to take a break to see the reality of life. Not a feel good book, by any means, but who cares? Not all books will be, and I am glad for that! I will let you know how the meeting goes!"
4,True To Life Stories,"Let me start by saying I'm not a big Zane fan but, this was a good read. They were touching stories but kept my attention. Your heart will go out to the character's in this book, every story has its on message. These stories are tragic but powerful and need to be read."
2,I've never read a Zane novel...,"....and never would have were it not for this one. As someone else has said I'm glad everyone else liked this book but I hate it so far. Everyone else's reviews is making me want to finish it, lol, but I doubt my attitude will change. Subject matter is perfect which is why it caught my attention to begin with, but had I opened it and read a few paragraphs I wouldnt have bought it. My problems with this book:1. I thought the stories would be TRUE stories. (I'm not a big fiction reader).2. The childrens dialect is far too grown.3. And since I'm a product of a dysfunctional childhood, I found a few of these stories too unbelievable. But I guess thats the nature of fiction.All in all, sorry I hate the book. But like I said I'm not a fan of this author anyway. I give it one star for effort, and another one for subject matter....."
4,Good Read,"I really liked this book. I never been abused by anyone, but it's a good read for someone in that situation. They have lots of help lines in the back of the book for those in need. Overall some of the stories are quit disterbing, if this is you GET HELP!"
4,Punk and 1950's Rock? ...you bet!,"Punk music in general has everything to do with 1950's Rock n' Roll... and it makes sense! The Rock explosion in the 1950's was the birth of 'youth culture' as we know it. it was loud, untamed, and outrageous... Exactly what punk was in the late 70's, as a reaction to overblown arena/art rock acts.The Misfits were and always will be a mix of the following:1) 50's greaser rock2) 70's punk3) and a TON of B grade horror movies.I can't think of a more perfect way for the 'fits to pay homageto their roots than a full album of 50's classics. Pick this up if you wanna hear how it started!"
1,What is goin' on in Jerrys head?,"Ok, I'm a new Misfits fan (just started likeing the about 6 months ago). This CD is one of the worst things I've heard in a while. I was ashamed to be listening to it when I got it. I ended up selling it to Bookmans for like $3 (about all its worth). For the people that thought Famous Monsters was bad... Haha, that CD is the best compared to this.Jerry can't sing. He just needs to realize that the Misfits are no more and move on. He's only sticking with the Misfts name because he's a sellout and has so much invested in it. If you're a new fan like me and are looking for a good Misfits CD go out and buy Staic Age or Collection 1 and Collection II."
1,This is not the Misfits!,"Okay -- here's the required part of the review.Danzig was the Misfits, they're awful with out him blah, blah, blah ...Also ... have you noticed how many of used copies of this cd are for sale? Seeing that so many people are trying to get rid of this cd should give you a hint of how bad it is.They really should change their name to something along the lines of 'Misfits 3000 From Outer Space'. It would be fitting to have a stupid name for a stupid band."
2,average music...false advertising...,"first of all i have to say that Misfits Project 1950 is a disgrace and is nothing more than a complete joke. why this album carries the name misfits when its just jerry only and a couple other dudes from black flag and the ramones is beyond my comprehension. it should just be called the jerry only project because he's the only guy in the band that's actually from the misfits(not to mention he was only the bass player and didn't write any of the music in the original band). the misfits were one of the greatest punk/thrash bands of all-time and glenn danzig was the heart and soul of the group. its been said a million times before, but ill say it again anyway...no danzig=no misfits. skip project 1950 and get some of the real thing."
2,Ruined by Poor Production,"These are great songs and this album had a lot of potential. However, the vocals are absolutely buried and unintelligible. With this sort of music the vocals need to be waaaay up front, but they are buried. This is probably due to poor mixing and/or tracking, but I can't hear the vocals."
4,Good CD but no DVD..,I had read the descriptions of this CD and the customer reviews.. It is a great album but the one I got does not include the bonus DVD.. Which was mentioned in the description and mentioned in a few customer reviews. The reason I ordered this was to build my Misfits collection and for the DVD.. So I ask what the hell??....
4,I always wanted the Fits to do a 50's cover album and thankfully it delivers for the most part,"It was always a dream of mine to hear the Misfits do a cover album reinvinting music stylings they obviously took influence from. This Magic Moment, Dream Lover,Latest Flame, and Runaway are worth the price alone in my honest opinion.It's not the greatest release ever to come fourth from that special pit in hell the misfits where spawned from but it's a fun listen nonetheless."
3,not the same without danzig,"the misfits(minus danzig) cover some rather sappy songs from the 1950's, but because these are just covers i let the singer slide, he's no danzig, but he sure does try."
4,fun rock & roll,"Let's face it: a Misfits CD without Danzig is going to get it's share of unfair criticism by fan boys who want to be like Glenn when they grow up and will be unhappy about every little thing on this one like the 'whoas' not sounding the way they want them to or how the covers dont outshine the originals (it was the same in the Danzig era too since American Nightmare was impression of Elvis' Sun stuff, Spook City USA was The Beach Boy's Surf City USA, and Rat Fink was Rag Mop with changed words and none of those songs came close to the originals either)or how this one is too short even though it's longer than classic Misfits albums or they won't get the whole retro thing or they will make up some other reason to be unhappy. I've enjoyed all eras of the Misfits so far and fans of fun rock 'nroll who don't care for the whole Misfits soap opera and just want to hear a fun CD should give this a listen."
3,thumbs up,I've played Project 1950 to death and still keep going back for more.The band puts snarl into these oldies and the thunderous sound added to these old songs is killer.How could anybody not love this?
3,aint bad,this aint bad. its cool hearing jerry and the boys cover 50's tunes. i like the crunch and volume they bring to the songs.
4,decent 50's tribute worth owning,"Jerry Only, Marky Ramone, and Dez of Black Flag serve up some great 50's covers and are joined by the legendary Ronnie Spector. This is energetic Rock N Roll from the first track to the last. The sound quality was always dubious on classic Misfit's albums, but Project 1950 sounds better, but still raw, and does an excellent job of delivering an entertaining combo of punkishness and 50's fun that's worth purchasing. A bonus DVD is also included and it introduced me to the vibrant shock rock stylings of Balzac."
3,Not Bad,"Project 1950 is a good time CD. It sounds like they had fun making it and is fun to listen to. I've noticed that some reviewers wish that Jerry had cut the saxophone on the songs to eliminate that part of the 50's vibe and make the songs more like Misfits' songs. Others wish he hadn't cut the ""wa-wa-wonder"" of Runaway which definitely wouldn't have sounded like a Misfits song. Somebody would be unhappy no matter what, but for those looking for fun 50's covers with some crunch this isn't a bad CD at all."
4,SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED THE JERRY ONLY EXPERIMENT,FIRST THINGS FIRST THIS ISN'T A MISFITS ALBUM JERRY SHOULD HAVE CALLED THIS THE JERRY ONLY EXPERIMENT OR SOMETHING. THE ADDITION OF DEZ AND MARKY WAS GREAT AND VOCALLY JERRY DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB ON THIS ALBUM. THE SONGS ARE GREAT AND VERY WELL EXECUTED ONLY PROBLEM IS THERE ISN'T ENOUGH OF THEM AND THE CD IS ONLY 24 MINS. THIS ALSO COMES WITH A BONUS DVD OF THE FITS PLAYING THESE SONGS AND THEY ARE GREAT LIVE. ALSO THE DVD SHOWS JERRY AND BALZAC DOING SONG TOGETHER ON STAGE NOT BAD EITHER ALTHOUGH THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE FITS/BALZAC SONGS ISN'T THAT GREAT.ALL IN ALL THIS IS A GREAT CD WITH AMAZING SONGS CONGRATS JERRY ON A GREAT CD. NOW GET YOU F$CKING BROTHER BACK AND CREATE SOME NEW MUSIC WE ARE ALL WAITING. IT'S NOT TOO LATE.....
1,mind-blowingly bad!,"if you thought the misfits without danzig were bad...you haven't heard nothin' yet. couldn't only just smell the failure of blending the 50's with ""punk."" it makes no sense. it sounded like a bunch of frat boys in a ""punk"" band got drunk, found their parents old vinyls, and decided to record an album. i wish i could give it a rating lower then one like -5 stars. if you wanted proof of satan in music here you go...and i thought famous monsters was bad, this makes it look like a masterpeice."
1,Ugggh.......,"First of all there really is no Misfits no matter what Jerry might say. After listening to these songs it made me realize just how bad Jerry is looking to scrap together some sort of dignity. As for Balzac they can just be seen as one of those bad Elvis impersonators that are everywhere. They lack style, vocals, and and being good. Save your money and buy the Mifits Boxed Set if you really want to hear ""the Misfits."" Better yet, go buy a Danzig cd and listen to some real vocals."
2,"Some fun, but...","I have to agree with the reviewer who said that the Misfits still were good post Danzig but this has crossed the line. Jerry Only has put together what he calls an ""All Star"" version of the Misfits. What a joke. I had no problem with the Graves' Misfits. The songs were good, his voice kicked and they were less serious and more funny and that was cool with me. Guys that age trying to be mean and scary would have been dumb (can we say ""Danzing"", folks?). At this point Only does not want to hire anyone else to sing and is now the new lead singer and while his voice does not suck...this is just lacking. Only says he wanted to pay tribute to the 50s but truth be told he can't write a song so they did what all washed up bands do: make a cover CD. The DVD confirms what a joke they have become. However, this CD/DVD is almost fun in it's sadness. Buy it used for under $5.00 and have a laugh."
5,MISFITS - IT'S COOL......,Excellent cd. The Misfits (or Jerry Only) it's fantastic. I don't care with bad reviews. The Misfits it's forever Misfits.... Buy this now !!!! I will wait the Misfits DVD....soon....
4,RE: Too Short but not short enough!!!,"This is an album of COVERS. They are not supposed to be better than the original, but rather they are a TRIBUTE to the original artist. DUMBA$$."
1,Terrible,"First off, I am not a Danzig or nothing fan who hates everything besides for the original line up. I prefer the Danzig era Misfits, but actually enjoy the Michale Graves albums. I wish he would have stayed for this one, because it is just bad. It sounds like a bad joke and any minute it should get good.This really surprised me because I am a fan of the original songs, I like the Misfits in most forms, and I am a sucker for a cover song. That being said, this was the only Misfits album I have deleted off my computer after I bought. I don't ever want to hear it again."
4,freakin fun,"Project 1950 works if accepted on a level of fun. If you are upset about who is in the band, or how old they are, or the current state of punk, or anything other than enjoying a fun rock & roll record then you should pass on it. Dez, Marky, and Jerry put their hearts and souls into it and you can hear it. The classic songs here are better constructed than many of the ones that The Misfits made famous, but what made em so great was that they were freakin' fun and that same vibe resonates on every track of Project 1950."
5,they walk among us,"Well its about time jerry only from the misfits showed you how its done this album is without a doubt a work of resurected art thank you Mr.Only for showing all the fiends that the misfits are here to stay,for all you new to the scene punkers this is were it all started the sounds of the old is what has evolved into what we know as punk rock, iam happy to see that jerry has finally done a project that was dream for him, jerry from one of the biggest fiends thank you.....everyday is halloween"
1,misfit,"The Misfits are dead. Jerry Only is riding a wave that has broken. Being the only Misfits member on the cd, maybe the group should be called ""Misfit"". I really enjoyed the doo-woppy ""Saturday Night"" from the Famous Monsters album and was genuinely looking forward to this album. I ended up being genuinely disappointed. These guys are ready for the county fair circuit."
3,Misfits Part 3,"Yeah, I bought this out of morbid curiosity. I thought Jerry Only was beating a dead horse carrying on The Misfits after Chud and Graves left. This album's not too bad though. It sounds exactly like what it is: The Misfits doing covers of 50s tunes. What you're imagining in your head now is most likely what it sounds like. Jerry Only isn't the vocalist Graves was, but he's passable. It's not a fantastic album or anything, but I admire the guts it must take in today's music market to do an album of nothing but oldies covers. Not too cool, but that's what's so cool about it. But yes, these oldies are given The Misfits treatment, and will most likely appeal to the fans of the band even if they don't care for the original songs(I like the originals as well). I would have given it more stars, but it's way too short and probably won't get an awful lot of play. It is a worthy addition to your Misfits collection, however, and clearly a labor of love."
1,One star is too much.,"Wow, I haven't seen a flaming pile of crap this monstrous since the great crap burning of 1986. This album sucks. Really sucks. Even the 'Whoa's are bad, which really shouldn't happen on a Misfits album. Don't buy this CD."
3,catchy retro rock,"This isn't bad. The connection between the Misfits and 50's and 60's pop culture are numerous (Numerous retro elements in songs, The Misfits logo looks like it was cobbled together from the EXACT letters from the cover of Famous Monsters of Filmland Magazine, The Misfits name was taken from a film made in the 1950's) so the retro thing makes sense and Jerry is surprisingly listenable. I give it three and a half stars."
3,This is alright.,"This CD is not the greatest, but then again its just a side project, and for a side project its great. I love the originals of all the songs already,(except ""great balls of fire"") so why wouldn't I like covers of them, especially by the misfits!(or as I like to call them now, the ""misfit/ramones/black flag tribute band"")The DVD is a good bonus, I recomend this to hardcore fans. other than that buy ""static age"" or ""American Psycho"" instead"
1,waste of money,"I advise anybody thinking about buying this cd to save your money. This cd is awful,the dvd is even worse. Danzig is working on a new cd, save your money for that, you wont be dissapointed. I've always been a fan of the Misfits but as far as I'm concerned the Misfits are over. Balzac? what a joke."
1,Not good I didn't enjoy this book,Just Enough Light to KIll I do not enjoy this type of book. I didn't even finish it. Slow and too much description.
4,Continuing sage of Fiddler and Fiora,"This is one of eight books in the Fiddler and Fiora series. I have just read them all in sequence- and I like every one of them.These are early books by Lowell under her Ann Maxwell pen name, written in conjunction with he husband. Read in sequence, they describe the on again - off again relationship between Fiddler and his ex-wife (but still lover) Fiora. They have the complication of Fiddler's borderline-legal attempts to help peolpe out of trouble, especially in dealing with both white-collar and drug-related criminals.These are very enjoyable short reads."
4,"At , last, a look beyond stereotypes","Very good book. Reccommended for anyone interested in Japan, or travelling in Japan -- esp for people who might be travelling or living there an extended time. We lived in Tokyo for nearly three years during the late nineties, and the complexities and surprisingly strong push for change that you notice if you talk a lot to women are very accurately described in this book. This book really belies the largely Western stereotype of submissive, traditional women. The book is also quite sympathetic and insightful in describing some of the difficulties of Japanese men in a changing society. Anyone interested in getting a feel for possible future directions of Japanese society should read this book."
4,Murder in the Queens Arms--Double Entendre?,"One of Aaron Elkins' better works, but then his earlier works are my favorites and I believe I've read most if not all he has written. Elkins has a wonderful, almost dry sense of humor which works quite well given the European setting. I rate this one definitely higher than I would his last three, beginning with the one set in South America."
3,A Crying Robot?,"Sorry. Some things are just too much, and a robot which cries oily tears is one of them. As is a sailboat blown up by an explosive strapped to a remote control boat (it's tried twice in this book), a couple of beautiful women who are murderesses and/or criminals...hey, wait, there are at least THREE of those. And some nerdy guys who are developing major technological breakthroughs in artificial intellegence (hence the robot and the boat. Get it?) Add a car chase down a rocky mountain road and a shoot-em-up battle in a gun shop and five dead people--this is a thrill-a-minute book in less than 300 pages. It reads like a screen play, actually, rather than a novel, but if you like plot-heavy novels, this is a good one for you to read."
5,More Than I Expected!,"As a neophyte in the digital camera world,I was challenged and inspired by the possibilities presented to me by Gregory Georges. This book provides more information than I ever expected to find in one place, and will be all I need to become a good photog as I go into my retirement years. I found extremely useful the author's comparisons of digital image editors. Thank you, Gregory Georges, for writing a ""how to"" book that is fun to read and clear in its directions."
5,More Than a Beginner's Book,"This book is a truly wonderful source of ideas, and a wonderful source of information on some of the programs a digital photographer might want or need. I'm not at all new to digital photography but I learned a great deal from the book, and got several invaluable ideas from it. I was also reminded of several programs which will make digital photography easier and more fun for me, my family, and my friends. If every definition isn't precise, if every single idea doesn't appeal to every sinlge reader, that's not the point. The immense value of this book is that anyone with an open mind *will* learn from it and will find at least several ideas she/he wants to incorporate into their own experience. It's one of the very best digital photography books I've read."
5,Great for learning what you can do with a digital camera,"After having a digital camera for a couple of months, I thought I had a pretty good idea of what could be done with digital photos--NOT! This book gives you dozens of ideas about how to use your digital photos. It lists all kinds of software, hardware, and services to make it easy for you to do what you learn can be done. If you have a consumer level digital camera and you want to know whay you can do with your digital photos, then this is the book you'll want to have."
4,Cute little multitasker...,"I tried this little guy because of an 'alert' on another site...very good price relative to 'retail'. It's a knife that you don't really need; but, it could end up being your favorite 'go-to' knife for many tasks. The blade is very versatile but I wouldn't recommend it for chopping necessarily. My DW usually chooses a narrow serrated knife for sandwich prep but this one really works better...sharp enough for the most stubborn tomato, wide enough to spread butter, mayo, etc. Stout enough to cut meats, cheeses,etc. All in all, a fun addition to the knife collection. The finish(Damascus swirls) takes a little getting used to...always looks like something is on the blade...the logo looks like a bit of food left behind...otherwise, a good value when purchased on sale!"
5,How old am I?!?,"I'm 37 years old. I've been cooking for over 20 years. I've owned many, many knives. I have never seen a knife slice through a tomato as easily as this knife does. It doesn't even feel like you've made contact with the tomato, you're already through it.Yes, it's expensive. It's totally worth it, too."
3,"Great sandwich knife, but spurious quality","I've had this knife for over two years and use it daily for making sandwiches, for which it's a perfect all-around knife: spreading condiments, slicing tomatoes and onions, but not dicing anything because of the scalloped edge, and cutting sandwiches in halves or quarters. The only thing I find suspicious is that instead of flexing, it'll stay bent and not spring back to its original, straight shape. Very strange for Shun. So, I don't flex it and it does what it's designed to do for me. It keeps a very good edge compared to my regular knives, Wusthof's, which keep an excellent edge. Haven't had any of the chipping or rusting problems others seem to have had."
5,As Expected For A Shun,"I have been drooling over the Shun series for years but they just never came high enough in my budget priorities. Thanks to Amazon.com, this one finally did and it was exactly as expected. Excellent edge and handling and great knife to behold also. I hope to add to my Shun collection over time."
3,Overpriced,"The knife is very good looking and works well. However, it is very overpriced for it's functionality. There are many other manufacturers who produce utility knives that work as well, if not better and are less expensive."
4,This is my go-to knife,"I have a set of Wustof knives, but I always grab this Shun. It is the perfect knife for just about everything (other than chopping). Cutting, slicing, spreading... it is great. Makes me wish I had an entire set."
5,solid knife,"This knife is about 3 months old and has retained its edge beautifully, so far. i use wood and poly cutting surfaces. Good balance and heft. The tip shape take a bit getting used to. It is rounded. this one will require professional sharpening. (and I mean sharpening, not honing)Great for small loaf breads. the D handle is nice but does not fit my hand as well as some other knives that I own (Wustof, Henkel, Calphlon and Cutco). My hand is large and the shape does not fit as well as it does for my wife. it is a great addition to the collection but not a primary knife. Pick up a chef knife, paring/utility knife and a long bread knife."
1,Why...,"Why, Angel, WHY!? She was great in No Secrets - all of No Secret's songs are positive and cheerful, but all of her new songs are just bad. They're really cliche, and they talk about stuff like girls who use boys and dumb stuff like that. Also, she has another album where she's wearing a jacket but no shirt, her hair looks awful, and her songs have a lot of bad stuff. I'd love her if she'd stuck with No Secrets, or at least they're cheerful style of music, but now, she's awful! Oh, No Secrets, where art thou? I mean, I loved No Secrets cause all they're songs were good and clean, but Angel by herself is not."
5,Go Angel,This to me was a great CD and I would sugest people buy it and join the mailing list and the fan club!
5,"I believe in Angel, I believe in this cd!!","1. Believe In Angels 10/10 This is a pretty song dance!!2. Lessons In Love 10/10 A song R&B;, very nice!!3. Wild Guess 9/10 A pretty song with sound pop/rock!!4. Once Upon Our Time 10/10 This is a wonderful song!!5. Chinese Whispers 10/10 Originally sound!!6. Mama's Little Girl 5/10 I don't like this song!!!7. Just The Way I Am 10/10 A wonderful single, very hit!!8. Three Small Words 10/10 A very good song !!9.

You Release Me 9/10 A original song!!"
4,Sounds good to me.,It seems good to me.I don't have it yet so i'm not sure if it's great.Right away i can tell angel has a great voice.I love That'sJUst The Way I Am.THere was one part when she sounds just like Jojo.I don't believe what some people are saying.JUst cause she has a great voice does not mean she's a angel!I think you should buy this c.d.I'll write more when i get the c.d.
1,Same Sound as Before,"I thought maybe on her own Angel would bring a different feel and sound to her music but she still sounds like she is leading a bunch of 5 year olds through a kindergarten parade. None of the songs have that special sound that captivates you like ""Toxic"" by Britney it sounds like some little kid wrote the songs. Good try but try again please!!!!!"
2,"It's all hype, folks!","From the moment I found out that Angel had left her four lame friends of No Secret I was excited. The most talented and attractive member of the band was going solo. It all looked so promising too. Her website had clips and videos of Angel doing some awesome material, so I expected the album to be that and more. WRONG! Drawn in by songs sampled on her website like How Can I Lie, Speed Seduction & Love Song With A Twist, I bought the album knowing these songs weren't on there. I didn't care though because I thought if those awesome songs didn't make the album, then the songs on the album must be even better. WRONG AGAIN! The album is poor! There are only about 4 or 5 decent songs, depending on your taste. The rest are heavy on the pop , love and cheese factor. Oh how I wish I could have my money back!"
1,Really Bad!!,I went to a concert of hers at my school and i thought she was horrible and you could defintely tell that she lip-syncs. Lets just say that music isn't your thing Angel Faith if that is your name. Get a life and i recommend you not to sing anymore
3,Not exactly the same as some of the original 128043 model,"My old 128043 model broken. And don't want to drill new holes on the screen door for any new models found in the hardware store. So I tried to find the exactly the same model. From the picture it seems look the same, but it is different. The door open handle part is a little too closer, about 1/8"", to the latch installed on the door frame so the door would not close appropriately. I had to insert a little particle to move the latch bar a little in order for the door to be able to close.Anyway, it is a good product and there is nothing wrong with it. So please don't get me wrong here. I am sharing my experience only for people who want to find exactly the same product, this is not neccessary the exactly same one as you may think it is, at least in my case it is not.Hope this review helps for people looking for exactly the same model."
2,Outside the Strike Zone,"This was my first MHC novel, and perhaps it was not the best one to start off with. But, given that the issue of medical research fraud interests me, I thought I'd give it a read.MHC probably spends more time talking about what her main character had for lunch than any sort of believable medical research (fraudulent or not), so I assume (very unkindly) that it was a plot device to make this novel different from all the others she has written. By the time I was done, I was thinking that I might have just read an outline for a ""Murder, She Wrote"" episode.So, I did not find the plot to be particularly innovative, the medical information to be particularly well-researched, or the obligatory tension-building scenes to be... well, anything but obligatory. If there was a bin for ""Pulp Suspense"", this would fill it nicely.Two stars for the fact I was able to finish it without throwing it out in disgust. But there were moments....."
1,MHC Needs to take a break,"This was the most boring MHC book to date. I thought I would NEVER get it finished. I guess she is running out of ideas, either that or retire!!"
2,Really Disappointing,"Mary Higgins Clark is one of my favorite authors and I always look forward to each new book. Her last book, Daddy's Little Girl was somewhat disappointing; this book is extremely disappointing. The book is poorly written and contains some major plot flaws. As an example, one of the main characters, Ned Cooper, suffers from an infected, burned hand that is featured prominently in the first half of the book. However, once the injury has served its purpose in advancing the plot, it is never mentioned again. One day, Ned's hand is so swollen and painful he can't use it. The very next day, Ned is back to shaving, emailing, etc without any difficulty. I found flaws like this to be very distracting. I also found the basic medical and financial sabotage plot to be rather implausible. Let's hope Mary Higgins Clark returns to her full potential in her next book."
1,First Book Club book - BC,I was told many good things about MHC but this book seemed to be the worst one to read to begin knowing Clark. The story was too scattered for me jumping from one character to another and there were many characters yet not enough information on the important aspects of the story. Was a disappointment to me as well as a very flat ending.
3,Good but the Same,"I love Mary Higgins Clark and this book was no different. However, it was really preictable and much like her other books. I figured it out within the first chapter. Not one of her better books but still an enjoyable read."
3,Not one of her best - average,"As an avid Mary Higgins Clark fan, I was disappointed. The plot was underdeveloped, several relationships - including the one between main character Carly and her love interest - were underdeveloped, and several times I put it down for days at a time. Normally, I read Mary Higgins Clark in one sitting."
3,Not as great as the other ones...,"This isn't nearly as great as Daddy's Little Girl, another one of Clark's recent novels. From the beginning, we are revealed the identity of the serial killer, which takes away the surprise of ultimately finding out who the culprit is. I also find that Clark is a predictable writer. There is a trend that after about nine-tenth of the book the serial killer will be attempting to kill the protagonist, who is the detective, and then someone would try to kill her and that ends the story. Also, why is the protagonist always a female and the main antagonist always a male? Why not switch things around?"
2,Second time around,"I was disappointed in this book. I thought is got boring at times, and the plot thin. I have so enjoyed most of her other books, but felt this one fell short."
3,Better than the last couple of her books,"I almost didn't buy this book because I was so disappointed in her last couple of books. This one was better; however, the ending was loose and abrupt. I like her main character, Carley, but felt the character of Casey, Carley's love interest, was not developed well enough to be an integral part of the story. I do feel that Ms Clark did a good job of developing Ned's character, and I even felt compassion for him.I do have to agree with another reviewer regarding writing in the ""first person."" I generally avoid those as well. It's pretty hard to get caught up in a story when the character is telling you what's happening --- you know they won't die because then they can't tell you what happened next. Oh well!Here's hoping her next book is better."
2,This is not the old Mary Higgins Clark,"I have read all of her books and found her to be an excellent writer, especially her earlier books. But this new novel of hers is boring and repetative. It was a type of a story that you kept reading hoping that the ending would be spectacular. But sorry to say it was just as dull as the rest of the book.If you are MHC fan, expect to be disappointed"
3,Second Time Around,I am an avid fan of MHC...have read every suspense novel she's ever written. This was my first disappointment. I felt the characters were not developed enough and the plot was very thin. Hope this was the first and last time for this....
2,Flat and Unconvincing,A financial advice columnist becomes a crack investigative crime reporter overnight . . . the plot hinges on research--conducted by only one person years ago--by a physician who has discovered 'vaccines' that cure cancer and also multiple sclerosis . . . nearly all the characters put up little or only token resistance to talking to a member of the media . . . the reporter uses the same argument to convince everyone to talk to her (gets boring) and always wears pant suits . . . the characters are fairly shallow--developed only as far as necessary for the plot.And by the middle of the book I had guessed correctly who the bad guy was--the modus operandi was only slightly surprising.Yawn
3,The Second Time Around,"This is one of her earlier ones, not as good as her newer ones but still a good novel"
1,Bor-ing!,"This book is a big bore! I am forcing myself to finish it b/c I have no other reading material right now. Clark might be a good authur, but she doesn't prove it with this book. If you want to try a Clark novel then try one that has greater than 4 stars."
2,Not a typical MHC story,"This book was very boring and predictable. I have read many MHC books and will not read another for a while. One thing that may have helped this story was to develop the love relationship more than an occasional dinner or phone call. I usually cannot predict the outcome of her stories, but this one I new early on."
2,Not my usual Mary Higgins Clark,This book didn't do it for me. I have all the MHC books and this is the first one that has disappointed me. It read more like a Carol Higgins Clark book than a Mary Higgins Clark book. I'm hoping the next one works better. I like having an author on whom I can depend.
1,My first and last MHC Novel,"I decided to give MHC a try because the premise to this book seemed exciting. Boy, was I wrong!!! This is one of the worst books I've ever read....The language is so elemental and simplistic, even a 12-year old could've written this!I got tired of the heroine's silly first-person narrative (in particular, when she describes how people look and how the places she visits are decorated) and her ""can't do anything wrong"" luck as she goes around interviewing an endless parade of characters who seemed cut out of cardboard like herself.The story is boring and repetitive - nothing exciting happens in the first 200 pages (I must confess I've given up and stopped reading)."
1,Carol Higgins Clark?,"This book is so badly written and ill plotted that I turned to the cover and flyleaf twice to be sure it wasn't co-written by MHC's daughter. For example, how many times must the author describe Carley's outfits as ""having been bought at an end of the season sale""? The ""feel good"" ending was over the top. If MHC truly wrote every word of this one, she needs to take a breather and spend time in developing a story, plot and characters with some originality. She is becoming a her own mimic."
4,Good Read,"ISBN: 0743206061Title: The Second Time AroundAuthor: Mary Higgins ClarkPublisher: Simon & SchusterClark Pens another bestseller with her novel ""The Second Time Around."" Suspense builds as investigative reporter Carley DeCarlo delves into the mysterious events surrounding the reported disappearance and possible death of Nicholas Spencer, head of prominent medical research company. Diligent digging into rumors of the failure of Gen-Stone's cancer cure convince Carley that the rumors are false and that something sinister is afloat. Mary Higgins Clark is a master at creating page turners, and ""The Second Time Around"" is no exception.Beverly J Scott author of ""Righteous Revenge"" and ""Ruth Fever."" Reviewer for Intriguing Authors and Their Books at http://www.funeralassociates.com/authors.htm"
2,Poor writing - and no suspense,"I made it through the book - thus, I'll give it 2 stars, but the level of writing is simply unforgivable for a woman of MHC's talent. Maybe she is just out of touch, but the ""slacks"" outfit descriptions alone are enough to undermine the reader's belief in the main character as a real person. This book never scares you the way the vintage MHC books did, and even when the slightly less obvious villains emerged, I felt nothing. The reviewer who felt like this was a ""Murder, She Wrote"" plot was dead on."
1,Disappointed in MHC,"Like one of the previous reviewers I checked the book jacket twice to make sure I was reading a Mary Higgins Clark book. I have read everything she has ever written, which is why I read this book, even though it was written mostly in first person form. I should have saved myself the time. I am use to her main male and female characters having chemistry and being so well written about that I feel as if I know them by the end of the book. No so here."
3,"Good, but not one of her best.",Having read all of Mary Higgins Clark's books I would say that this one is good but didn't hold me at the level of suspense like some of her earlier work did. If you are new to her books I would recommend either Where are the Children or While my Pretty One Sleeps.
5,My Impression,My first impression of the new Sandra Kaye album..... WOW!!!!!!What a great range of selections! All of the selections were beautifully done. But my favorites were the smoldering bluesy jazzy songs. Good luck always.Frank Manko10-10-01
1,Don't Buy This Book!,"I bought this book on a whim in a used bookstore for $9 dollars becauseof the inviting picture of Douglas Adams on the cover. (Sadly now I see I could have boughtit for 92 cents on Amazon, though it probably isn't worth that, especially if you include the mailing fees.)I love Douglas Adams. M. J. Simpson...seems to not exactly HATE Douglas Adams. butclearly loathes him...taking every opportunity to call him ""a liar"", ""weak"", stealing from Monty Python--etc, etc. Ow! Lots and lots of lists of people and titles and dates of things that don't matter.A strange, sad, dull, book.The only part of redeeming value is the foreword by Neil Gaiman, who clearly was fond of Douglas Adams as the rest of his readers were, except for the Author of this Biography...odd that.Instead of selling this book back to the used bookstore, or depositing it at the local thrift store, I will toss it into the trash, so no one else will mistake the bookcover for a good, warm read of Mr. Adams."
2,Tedious.,"I love Doug Adams' writing, and was hoping to learn about him as a writer and a person. I think I might have been better served to choose Neil Gaiman's ""Don't Panic"" for this instead.I found this book to be rather tedious. I wanted to come away from the book with insight into Douglas's beliefs, personality, and inner workings, but instead, I came away with a head full of dates and statistics and names names names names names.I forced myself to keep reading, but really didn't find the book interesting until the last couple of chapters."
1,Reheated,"Like many books of this type, Simpson's is content to reheat the same tired tales while giving little (if any) fresh insight into the man behind the curtain. While not a complete waste of time, it is a complete waste of money. Don't give this hitcher a lift."
4,Very thorough,"This is an excellent grammar for English speakers. It has a thorough review of preposition usage, an excellent guide to the subjunctive and pretty much everything else I usually get wrong ;-) I browsed for a couple of hours in Borders on Oxford Street and couldn't find anything better. Nicely type-set as well. The only problem is the hideously ugly cover."
5,Reloading book Old but Great Condition,Received the item quickly and for the age of the book it was in good condition.
3,Rough shape,It's the right book. But hardly fair shape. It's extremely well used. But will be used some more in the future.
3,I wished they were a little better,"I love having Haynes manuals. I probably have bought about 10 of them over the years. As much as they have bailed me out with needed information at times, I find them very lacking at other times. It would seem that when I get into a extensive project at times, they will not cover my specific year very well or they will be vague.So, like many other tools, you just need to have them around just in case."

5,WOW! Cool Vocal Jazz at its best!,"Smitty is the finest Cool Jazz vocalist I've ever heard. My favourite song ""Night and Day"" is so silky and groovy too.It's chicken skin music."
5,Fantastic Book!!,Amazon had the best price and it was something that I really wanted. Arrived fast and was in perfict shape.Great!!!
4,"Conscious, Inovative, and Good Sounds","Like many Deee-Lite fans I fell in love with World Clique and jumped on the chance to buy Infinity Within in 1992. To this day I still enjoy listening to the majority of the songs including Runaway, Heart Be Still, and Two Clouds Above Nine.Many do not remember the days of the CD long box package. Deee-Lite were one of the first bands to have an oddly designed, fold-out, and paper based cd case. For their socially and environmentally conscious fans it was an aesthetic bonus and an alternative to the wasteful paper packages where 2/3s of the packaging was empty space.The album also features awesome guest musicians such as Bootsy Collins, Maceo Parker, and Catfish Collins."
4,My personal favorite.,"""Infinity Within"" seems to be the least liked of their three albums, but I actually play it the most. They did get a little preachy on this album, but the music is still there. Plus, I don't mind thinking once in a while. ""Runaway"" and ""I Wont Give Up"" are both excellent tracks, and I find it hard to believe they didn't make the ""Best Of"". The rest is all good, but the best song here also has the longest title, ""I Had A Dream I Was Falling Through A Hole In The Ozone Layer"". And as intended, all their albums will leave you with one overall feeling, that ""Love Is Everything""."
2,Not so delightful,"Deee Lite is a fun group and they make good party music. This album, though, is quite inferior to ""World Clique"" in my opinion. I was disappointed by it when I ought it nearly 15 years ago and I listened to it again after many years recently and still found it lacking, though can't say exactly why. If you like this group's sound (and I do) ""World Clique"" is simply a much better album."
4,Not bad.,"I agree with Gorgan; this disc isn't bad at all. Pretty good, actually. While I concede that the first album is much better, Infinity Within is not without World Clique's infectious ""groovelicity"" (the band's word). However, I suppose it's a moot point as the ""label [is] out of stock."" Fans will definitely want to hunt for a copy."
3,An average Deee-Lite,"Infinity Within finds Deee-Lite in their most political and avant garde grooves yet. I appreciate this CD more for it's lyrics than the actual music presented which I find lacking in energy and fun. The two meld together perfectly however, on the playful 'Pussycat Meow'. Infinity Within is pure Deee-Lite but not nearly as fun as their other two albums. I listen to it mainly while doing other things (writing, cleaning, talking). For pure fans though it's not to be missed for the ""only Deee-Lite could write those lyrics"" angle."
3,Ok for the price...,Baskets did not have the same shade as shown in the picture. They are not neatly finished. OK for the 20$ price.
1,i thought it was kinda silly,"i thought this would be quiz questions and trivia questions and things like that but it wasnt. there were some neat pictures and things but not anything to really quiz me on ""what i know about the king of rock and roll"" like the title says. it was kinda misleading"
3,TANTALIZING TRIVIA THAT WILL LEAVE YOU ALL SHOOK UP!,"What was Elvis' favorite soft drink? The name of his customized Convair jet? His last Top 10 single? And you thought you knew everything about The King! Think again. W. Kent Moore and David L. Scott has amassed some mighty tantalizing, teasing trivia that will leave you all shook up. The soft-cover gem is as much as sourcebook of all things Elvis as a thought-provoking volume that rocks and rolls. There are more than 1,000 brain teasers--- including fill-in-the blanks, crossword puzzles, word scrambles, hidden word games and multiple-choice questions. There's even a sprinkling of black-and-white photos, including one of The King next to the used BMW he bought in 1958 for ... Give you the answer? Don't be cruel. Turn to page 44."
1,one word: L A M E,i should have read all the reviews not just the first one. i didnt like this book at all.
1,"if you are a third grader, you may like this","but I actually am an adult and anybody who says this is ""packed with information"" or anything else like that is either stupid or just sucking up to the authors. this is nothing but a collection of word searches, crosswords and jumbles and was about the biggest waste of my time and $$ that I can recall. this type of junk doesn't test your elvis knowledge, it tests your ability to find ""dont be cruel"" spelled backwards and surrounded by a bunch of other letters (how is that supposed to show how much i know about the king?). too bad that zero stars wasn't an option"
5,A Must Read for All Fans of the King!,"""Well make me a peanut butter and bananna sandwich, Priscilla, this is the greatest book I have ever read.""For anyone who truly loves the KING or needs a one-stop resource for all things Elvis, THE ULTIMATE ELVIS QUIZ BOOK is it! With the insight and depth of knowledge that only veteran EAP sleuths could provide, David Scott and Kent more take us on a fascinating, fun tour of the life of Elvis.The pictures are great, the puzzles are creative, and the authors know their stuff. There are lyrics listed in this book that even the most diehard fan probably didn't know existed.And the picture of the authors at the Elvis shrine is a classic. I think it should go on the back cover of the book, in color, when you print the next edition. Let me know when the next edition will be out!Thank you. Thank you very much."
5,Forever Elvis,"This quiz book was really informative, yet fun to do at the same time. It kept me very busy one long Sunday afternoon. For the really true Elvis-fan this book is a must-have!! I must admit that I didn't get all the answers at once, but kept coming back to fill in the blanks! The questions are asked in a variety of ways (e.g. crossword, blockword etc.) so that you never get bored or unduly frustrated! Each chapter deals with different aspects of Elvis' career; you are tested not only on your knowledge of his music, but also of his movies. So, if you're a true Elvis fan (like me!!!) you'll buy this book and keep it aside for that lazy Sunday afternoon! Oh, and don't forget to use a pencil ... just in case you make an error, then you won't spoil that precious Elvis quiz book!!!!"
3,Rezo 30,"Great quality case for the price, a little tight fit for the Panasonic DMC-TZ5 but generally okay."
5,lowepro camera bag,A very nice camera bag. Qaulity construction & features as advertised. Fits my Canon A1000 perfectly-- also has front velco flap with a generous compartment for batteries & memory cards. Slate grey on black looks great!
2,Not what I expected,"This is an instruction video on building a cabinet, not general woodworking. I wanted something to explain the tools and what they are used for. They do use the shopsmith and I suspect this is an old VHS tape converted to DVD so it's outdated.But on the good side, it does a good job on how to build a basic cabinet."
2,Disappointing for the money,"As noted by other reviewers, You should own a shopsmith or equivilent for these videos. I got them from a reseller and I am glad I did. I have many DVD's and wood working videos. You can see my other reviews. These are commercially made, but slightly deceptive????Many others to choose from, depends on what type of woodworking you are doing."
1,Plasma TV,"The company NEVER sent it, finally refunded my money, treated me badly, would never give a phone # or respond. Amazon, so far, had done NOTHING!I would rate it a ZERO, but Amazon MAKES you check at least the first star!"
3,"Good home trainer tire, but had one bubble","I was going through normal tires on the computrainer like mad before getting the home trainer tire; after which I have not had any visible wear on the tire at all. These tires also do not dust like road tires when on the trainer which keeps things much cleaner. One problem was that the tire developed a huge bulge when a tube went flat. Hopefully a one-off issue, and I have since replaced the tire. I have not gotten around to calling Continental to see if they will replace the tire."
1,most difficult tyre to fit in the world!,I concur with various reviewers of this tyre... It is the most difficult tyre to mount that I have ever come across. So far I have broken 3x tyre levers and 4x inner tubes trying to fit it! AND i still haven't managed to get it on without a leaking inner tube!I then tried to put my other tyre back on and it went on with no hassles what-so-ever.Seems to me that continental have no idea how big a wheel rim actually is.It is totally ridiculous... Buy at your peril.once on (albeit with leaking inner tube) it is quiet and does not get hot on the trainer.
2,tough to mount,"The reviews are right on, I blew four tubes getting it on my wheel the first time, so thinking its me and my lack of patience, I went to my LBS and had them mount it, only to have it blow another tube after one training session.Now, I'm fairly adept at changing my regular tires and tubes with no levers or other tools anywhere, anytime, so to me the problem is that the tire is too small for any rim, just a little larger would make a world of difference. But thats not going to happen so I would avoid this tire and buy yourself a cheap one for half the price. You'll be able to ride in a few minutes, rather than days after having to go buy new tubes."
5,Renewed Health,"Before reading Take Two Apples and Call Me in the Morning, I was recovering from heart surgery and had gained fifty pounds. I tried to follow a low-fat diet, but I was always hungry for a carbo binge, and was on the verge of gaining more weight. Low energy, poor sleep, aching joints, and itchy skin made me miserable and grouchy. What a revelation this book was! Adding fat in the form of olive oil, butter, and flax oil to my diet, eliminating wheat/sugar products, and eating protein with veggies for meals and snacks was the key to improved health. Judy Stone clearly and thoroughly instructs the reader to throw out the legalism of all those other ""diets"" and to eat the food your body needs to heal itself and maintain health. Do you want strong bones, supple skin, strong hair and nails, energy, a feeling of not being hungry between meals? Get this book.Julia Hanawalt"
5,Very soothing background music,"I love listening to it while surfing the Web and the best part is it puts my cats right to sleep without them playing w/ the ""mouse"" or trying to catch the cursor......"
3,WELL worth the money,"...The sleeve notes contain interesting pictures from the film. The whole album is a little short, and very much in the early 90s ""let's re-do the 80s in a 90s way"" style. The original movie music, however, is atmospheric saxaphone stuff. You really can feel yourself being sucked into a foggy sci-fi world. Also of note are the names of the bands who play on the album. ..."
1,DON`T BUY THIS MOVIE.,"I urge anyone who even thinks about it not to buy this movie. Its so bad it was difficult to give it 1 star.Being a great fan of Perry Como, and being brought up in the 50`s with nothing but happy memories of his TV shows i was waiting for this movie to be released. It was never released it escaped. The quality is awful, the sound is bad and the picture the same. I should have known better what else can you expect from Alpha Video. I know it was a budget price but i expected something better than this. I watched half an hour and threw it in the trash in disgust. Lets hope one day will see a better quality copy appear and also a release of Words and Music which also featured Mr C."
3,Best scene of 'Doll Face' badly remastered,"This 2008 release of Doll Face is beautifully restored, except for the Hubba Hubba performance, just after the barking sound made by Vivian Blaine. The image and sound skip for a few seconds. Such a pity! It's the best scene of the film. And there's no good alternative to this DVD-relaease."
1,Frustration!,"The order never came, even well after the expected due date. Emailed seller twice with no response. Emailed Amazon for assistance. Received email next day that product was in the mail, arrived a week later. Although I received what I paid for, the trouble wasn't worth it. I will never buy from this seller again."
3,Too tiny,"I had hoped for a small figurine to display on a desk. This Miniature is only about an inch tall. So, I was disappointed in the size. It seems it could easily be disappear in just the papers on your desk."
4,Great Family Movie,"My family and I really loved this movie. I have a nine and a six year old and we all thought it was great. It is a relaxing day at the movies. We laughed almost throughout the entire movie. The movie will definitly not be an Oscar contender, but frankly I think those are over-rated in the first place."
2,Shaggy Dog,"This movie was very disturbing to me,I did'nt like seeing the freaky animals in cages.The frog with the dog head bothered me.I don't recommend this movie for small children as they would take it too serious. There were some funny parts and Tim Allen played a very good role. I am an animal lover and I don't like seeing any kind of mistreatment of animals even if it is a movie. Now I know why this movie never came to my local theatre."
1,A real woofer,"I was on a plane from Shanghai to Bangkok -- stop drooling -- and I was reading a book. On the TV, I saw Tim Allen chasing an orange cat. In the course of the chase, he dropped down from two legs to four. The effects, I'll admit right up front, were great. This looked far better than the old 70s (I think) version called THE SHAGGY D.A., which I haven't seen. But even so, it sucks. I didn't need sound or subtitles, and I didn't need but 5 or 10 minutes to figure out that it sucks. True sucking is like that. (Yeah, I saw the bit with the Scrabble board. ""I am Dad."" Whoop dee freaking doggy doo.) It's possible we underestimate Tim Allen's ability as an actor, perhaps because THE SANTA CLAUSE was so unforgivably bad. But even so, this movie sucks. Sometimes life is just that simple."
3,Acting Ok,"I did not think that there was anything special about this movie. The acting was okay but nothing special. I think that it could have been better then the original, but it just lacked, especially for a Disney movie. This is one that I think I would watch if it was on but I don't think I would purchase it unless it was super cheap."
3,Nowhere as dumb as it claims,"So it's a dumb movie with a dumb plot - what do you expect? Agatha Christie? Robert Ludlum? This is a Disney film for children!As a kids' movie, it's a lot of fun with plenty of slapstick and lots of laughs. The plot is goofy, but the basic premise is hardly meant to be realistic. This is not cinema verité. People give ""What Women Want"" with Mel Gibson a much higher rating, but that's just as daft.There are plenty of set-piece chases, as you would expect with a storyline about dogs.If you want clever, go see the Usual Suspects, just don't take your under-eights."
3,Kids 10 and under will love it.,I watched this the next night with my son. It was funny to me. My son was disappointed it wasn't closer to the original he watched when he was a child. Or at least he gave me that impression. Tim Allen is very good where he gets to use his silly style of humor so of course he's best in kid's movies. I liked him and the special effects. The teens who played his children were a little annoying. I felt sorry for Robert Downey Jr. because he can do much better than this. But he has only himself to blame with his drugging. I couldn't help but think Walt Disney wouldn't approve of him and Tim (ex-coke user/likely seller himself) being in movies with his name attached. He liked anyone associated with him to have a squeaky clean image.
2,Boring,"I took my younger sibblings to see it because I thought that since Tim Allen is in it, it will be really funny. Well not really so I was bored about 30 minutes into it. It is very predictable the entire way though. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I think there explanation about why he turns into a dog was ate least creative."
5,DOG GONE Good Family Fun,"First I want to say that this is the first review I have ever written online. Before going to the movie, I read a not so favorable review. But, I loved the originals as a kid and wanted to share this with my 6 1/2 year old. After truly enjoying ourselves, I just had to tell others that this is a really funny and entertaining movie. Tim Allen was familiar to my son from Toy Story and The Santa Clause so he was excited to see it. His favorite line is when 'Shaggy' says ""To infinity and beyond!"" The animals were great and the story is simple but sweet. Dog lovers will enjoy looking for canine traits their best friend share. Go, take your family and have a great fun time!"
3,Entertaining,"Allen is a great performer and is fun to watch, the theme was a funny enough of a set up and there were enough situations to make good jokes and funny scenes.That said, this movie could have lost about a half an hour.I do recommend it as a decent family movie, my almost five year old got a kick out of it, but she did get a bit bored near the end too, it was just a little too long.The bad guys and the evil done in the film was a bit over the top, although I did enjoy the cgi animals that were created to show the horrible results of animal ""testing"". I felt there was too much propaganda, however I could live with it seeing as it was just a kids flick and being overly dramatic is sometimes part of the gig.All in all it's a good enough movie to take the kids out to the movies (probably best for the preteen set) and will definately be a decent rental."
5,The best fictional account of a southern civil war victory!,Ron Richards gives us a much needed realistic and enjoyable story of how the south could have won the civil war. Imagine a nation where Lincoln was replaced by Lee and Jefferson Davis. Truly an amazing literary work! A must for civil war buffs!
3,soothing,"Joshua is a pioneer in the field of world music, creating a synthesis of east and west. His music is perfect for both meditation and celebration. Sky Kisses Earth is a ticket to the ancient Tantric temples of India."
4,nice primer on nonparametrics,"Jean Gibbons is a leading researcher in nonparametric statistics and has published an excellent text on the topic. This monograph like most of the books in the Sage series is a concise non-technical treatment that serves as a primer on nonparametrics for the layman, particularly the social scientists. It is well-written and can serve as a good reference source. Books by (1)Conover, (2) Hollander and Wolfe and (3) Gibbons herself can be consulted for more details and more theory and applications."
4,Kotono Mitsuishi again in perfect form,"Excel Saga is one of those anime shows you dare not take the slightest bit seriously. ""Hey, Excel, what are you going to do now that you've graduated?"" ""ACROSS!! ACROSS!! ACROSS!!!"" She even sounded like Sailor Moon in that opening scene, though I doubt even Usagi was ever this scatterbrained."
5,Kiss your sanity goodbye.,"I've seen a lot of comedy animes, but none as rediculously hellarious as this. It's in a class of its own. The best Fast Paced comedy has to offer. Hell you're likely to see more in the first 7 minutes of this show than you would in a whole series. That's not all either. ADV has a assembled an top noche dub cast that actually managed to top the Japanese version.(something that was thought to be impossible by fans of the subbed version). The most noticable is ovbiously Excel's dub voice played by Jessiva Calvello. You may have heard her as Mink in Dragon Half. What's interesting is that the Japanese voiceo of Excel also played Mink. Anyway, the gags keep coming and the more otaku you are the funnier this show is. Highly Recomended."
5,Greatest anime ever in the history of the world,"I bought the boxset hoping it wouldn't suck. Oh my gosh. This is my favorite anime EVER! I mean this cartoon has everything. It makes fun of everything that needs/deserves to be made fun of. It's nice to watch someone on tv in cartoon form that's more messed up than I am, but yet reminds me of myself. I would recommed this to anyone who loves silly anime. You need to brain to watch this, cause none of it makes sense. So it's a win win kind of anime"
2,Umm Pain,"A friend got me the DVD for my Brithday. The DVD box is very funny and some what cool. But the over all DVD is dumb. I felt dumber after watching it and that hard to do since I can't spear much more brain cells. If you like silly young no real story line anima then your love it. Look at the rest of the reviews. But if your in to Akira, Neon G, Vamp-D, and so on don't bother wasting your money save it for Blood 2."
2,"Good series, but the dub destroys its charm.","Normally, I can deal with a bad dub and still love the series or movie (Ghost in the Shell, Eva, Slayers), but I just couldn't watch this a second time. Jessica Calvello, you have made an enemy. If the people at pioneer had the rights to this anime, it would be cool and funny.I can't recommend this to everyone, or anyone at that matter. Go get GTO or Trigun instead."
2,"If you like death, killing animals, etc. This is for you.","I saw the first two episodes of this series and I truly did not like it. The comedy was much to dark for my tastes. I have no problems with a show with no plot, however, this series just rubbed me the wrong way from the start. There is also the whole eating the dog thing which I can not stand even if it is for comedy value. Sorry but I don't find the eating of animals funny, even if it is not really shown. Parents: don't let your children see this it will disturb them greatly. To parents and others: If you want a series that is funny and not as sick as this go get Dragon Half, Oh My Goddess Mini, or Slayers. Don't bother with this."
3,"Even for anime, weird silliness and silly weirdness; otaku only","(If you don't know what ""otaku"" means, this DVD is not for you.)I get that most anime is weird by western standards, and Excel Saga is supposed to be weird even by anime standards. To some extent this worked for me; it was funny in a lot of places. (My favorite: ""Oh, no, her life is beginning to flash before her eyes! This isn't good!"" Or words to that effect; the first disk went back to Netflix weeks ago, and I never bothered with any more in the series.)But most of the silliness wasn't all that funny, at least not to me. There's almost no plot, almost no characterization; or what there is of each is glacially slow. Maybe if I watched more of the series, I'd better enjoy the first disk. But even with the (highly recommended) ""pop-up video"" extras, there just wasn't enough humor to make this worth my while.Really serious anime fans may love this. For the rest of us, not so much."
5,"Excel Saga, full of Hyatt goodness","I have become very fond of Hyatt after watching the second and third DVD in a row earlier today, but I digress. The Excel Saga gets even more bizarre in this second DVD. There is lots of unnecessary death (mostly Hyatt, who picks some wierd ways to die, like freezing in ice standing up) but it's even funnier than before. I said it before and I'll say it again: Hyatt has one of the best English voices I've ever heard in an anime series EVER. Her voice matches her character perfectly.Anyway, the parodies get more frequent, and some of them are easily recognizable to Americans like me (such as the Puchuu Queen, which looks like the alien from the Alien movies) and others are fairly obscure.If you liked the first volume of the series, you'll love volume two!"
3,"Okay, but not for young kids","I got this DVD to try out some anime. I'm reviewing it from the perspective of someone that was not an anime fan.Just make sure that your really young kids are not watching. This is a comedy for adults, its got a lot of twisted humor. As I watch it I think: Is Menchi really a dog or is she a cat? Why is Excel's neighbor always followed by his two friends? Poor Pedro....tormented by the happiness of his sexy wife and his son.This DVD is definately for adult anime fans. The story starts out that Illapallazo is going to take over a city (not the world) and Excel is for some reason the agent he picks for the job fresh out of school after she was run over and had flash backs of her life and then floated into some cosmos which is somehow a woman, she gets put into Illapallazo's basement to start her work as an Across agent. From there the storyline goes everywhere."
4,Excel saga is FUNNY to hard core anime fans!,"Why HARD CORE, becouse you wont get alot of the jokes in this anime unless you watch alot of anime (its one big PARADY). This is a great series and i have seen all of it. This 2nd DVD should be great. it will introduse another character and the bums next door to excel acually have a job! But its a little more COMPLEX then being public oficials! Im not for sure but i think this DVD will have the SCARY episode wich is one of the best ever (and makes fun of the movie ALIENS and BODY SNATCHERS!)Get ready 4 some more WACKY FUN!"
4,WOW!,"when i rented this dvd from my local video store, i wasn't sure what to expect. after watching it the first time, i promised myself never to rent it again....well, let's just say that that's all changed.i now realize my love for the series! i'll kill to buy it! i recommend this to practically anyone, but be prepared. this isn't your typical anime by a long shot!"
2,Perfect for Experienced Anime Fans Who Love Slapstick.,"To really enjoy this series, I think you'd have to be an experienced anime fan (to understand all of the parodies) and have a strong liking for slapstick comedy. The reason I say this is because about 99% of the comedy that compiles Excel Saga is parodying and heavy slapstick. Having seen a nominal amount of anime, I was unable to perceive most of the parodies. Some of the slapstick was funny, however, most of it was just too grotesquely wacky to be humorous."
4,Good independent western,"Jericho is a neat little film that shines despite the low budget that independent films are usually forced to work with. There are not a lot of stunts or special effects in this film, but the plot and character development are first rate and certainly better than much of the crap that the big studios often shove down our throats.At times it is a bit slow and it leaves you wondering exactly where it is going. The pace picks up near the end, however, and you turn off the DVD player happy that you went out and bought this movie."
5,An old fashioned western of the pre-spaghetti era,"I would have only given it four stars--a one-star penalty for TV-dialogue in places--but then I decided the nifty plot twist was worth a bonus star. Jericho is a classic hero-myth that would have done the Odyssey proud. In fact, I even wondered now and again if Homer didn't do a little consulting on the script. ;-) Kudos to Black Knight Productions!! Now go do another one.--Ejner Fulsang, author of ""A Destiny of Fools"" Aarhus Publishing"
3,JERICHO WITH MARK VALLEY,"The TV serial ""Human Target"" is very good, sure hope it comes back in the fall. This serial made me look for other movies with Mark Valley. Jericho was good and it is 3 to 4 stars in my opinion. Mark Valley is very good, the story was good."
5,Good Movie,"This was such a good movie... I love a good western, and a good story, and this did both. If you like Mark Valley you will enjoy this movie"
4,Western with a Twist,"If you like western movies, then you will like this one. Mystery, action, Texas, even Gunny is in this one."
3,Amusing but not that great,"It was watchable but flawed. The plot had possibilities but also a few holes and the performances were uneven. (I did like R. Lee Ermey though he's kind of wasted in such a small role.) Production values are similar to 60s or 70s TV westerns - flat, even lighting and costumes that never seem to take a stain. Sets were adequate, though."
4,Mark Valley: a cowboy - who knew?,"If you like the old western genre, you will love Jericho! So do not expect a bang-bang-shootum-up. In the 40's the lead would have been played by none other than Roy Rogers or Gene Autry. So, relax, and let the story unfold. You know the good guys are going to win. Oh, this is a movie you can actually watch with your children. Hey the best thing is, you get to watch Mark Valley ride a horse, partner. So bring on the popcorn and enter the 19th century."
5,Better and Better,"I really like the first cd, but this one is really great.....the band, arrangements, and voice blend together perfectly. Simply great!!!"
5,A Must Own Big Band Jazz Vocal CD!,"I have been enjoying Monte Procopio's 1st CD for a while now and have been hoping he would release another CD covering the standards. Well my wait is over and I can honestly say that I am thrilled with his latest CD ""A Swingin' Time."" It is obvious that he has taken the overall production of this new CD to the highest level and the end result is a stunning mixture of world-class arranging and production, extraordinary musicianship, and a stylish collection of highly innovative yet tasteful vocal treatments that clearly distinguish Procopio as one of the top Jazz/Big Band vocalists around today. This is one of the hippest Big Band Jazz Vocal CD's I own. I could go on and on telling you how much I love this CD, but the easiest thing to do is play the song samples and see for yourself. Enjoy!"
4,Origin of the Brunists - B-grade people meet religion,"Robert Coover's first novel, Origin of the Brunists, shows how he won so many awards for his poetry and short fiction. This is a book you won't forget. The book throws a strange group of definitely substandard people together, adds a set of bizarre events, shakes, and comes up with the most bizarre - but plausible - religion you have ever seen. Metaphysics, virtual Forteanism, downright stoicism, you name it, it gets thrown in and sort of works. The book is a study of the individuals, not the religion, but the religion serves to hold the people together. I haven't read this book in 15 years, and I'm aching to get another copy. If you like this book, try Coover's Universal Baseball Association - J. Henry Waugh, Prop., or a collection of his poetry and shortstuff, Pricksongs and Other Delights. At least one of these is in print."
3,looks better on net (more luminous) than in real life,"This comes in a handy foam envelope that protects it from damage. In spite of the fancy inlay design, it feels more like a ""masculine"" journal to me now that I see it in real life ... probably due to the black background.This will be my friend's Christmas gift, and I know he'll like it a lot but I wont buy again. I recommend the Potter Style mini journals that Amazon sells over this due to lower price and more attractive cover design."
2,Not too hot!,"I bought this torch as a gift for my wife, and neither of us are impressed with it after using it several times. First, it has a safety mechanism that is so hard to push down, you almost need to use a screwdriver (or something similar). It is so difficult to disengage the safety mechanism, that my wife often cannot do it. The second problem with this torch is that it is constantly going out, even though it is full of butane. Unfortunately, every time you want to light the torch, you must depress the safety, so it has turned out to be a real pain... If it stays lit (occasionally it does), it works great, but I don't think it is worth the effort."
1,disappointing,difficult to start and difficult to maintain flame. would think twice before buying again. especially difficult if one is left handed.
4,Operator Error?,"I own this torch and I have no problems with it at all. Sometimes I have to tweak the little slider that adjusts the gas flow in order to get the torch to stay lit, but once it's lit for a few seconds I can adjust the slider as appropriate. Perhaps the people having so many problems just aren't taking the time to use it properly, because it works great for me."
3,"Not perfect for Creme Brulee, but it's a GREAT Cigar Lighter.","I was given this as a gift. Honestly, if I make Creme Brulee I just use a propane torch to brown the top. I get a lot more heat output and the job is done really fast.But I have found a use for this little guy. It makes a GREAT cigar lighter. Don't hold the cigar in your mouth, that would mean pointing the flame at your face. But if you hold the cigar in one hand and toast the foot of the cigar with the other hand this little torch works great.So yeah, I like it. I just don't use it in my kitchen."
1,Pass the Torch,"The article, ""Perfecting Creme Brulee"" in the Nov-Dec 2001 of Cook's Illustrated, led me to the Microtorch by Roburn. After much searching I found it at Lee Valley. It has a built-in ignition trigger that does not need to be held down for the torch to remain lit. Very happy. 5 Stars."
2,Not the best blowtorch out there,"Blowtorches can be very useful in the kitchen. This one, however, is difficult to turn on. The heat is also hard to regulate. There are better blowtorches for your home kitchen. Pass on this one."
1,JUNK!!!!,"I used this torch to make creme brulee for about 6 months without a major problem then the flame died. It would light with a good flame for about 5 seconds and then wither away. I see that many others have also had the same problem. I then bought a MicroTorch by Roburn off Ebay for about $20 new including shipping and it is GREAT!! You don't have to hold down the button to keep the torch lit and the flame is solid. If you don't want to buy it off ebay just do a google search for ""Roburn Microtorch"". Don't waste your money on the Bonjour Torch."
4,Forgetaboutit,"If you love the Sopranos, Goodfellahs, Wiseguys and the cooking of the mob, you gotta get this as an accessory. Picture the situation, you've gone to the mattresses, the Don is sleeping with the fishes and your grill isn't hot enough to carmelise your brulee. What's worse is you think you got a mole from the Gabbini family in your organisation.What do you do? Baddabing! You pull out your Bonjour Cooking Torch, and get the guys to tie the mole suspect to the kitchen chair. You demonstrate your skill with the torch by carmelising the brulee in front of him. Then you say ""Hey Tony, you want I carmelise your pretty face or you gonna spill?""Works every time - and what a brulee, crispy light and thin, without ruining the cream. Capice?"
1,Not a good introduction to digital signal processing,"This review specifically addresses the text in respect to digital signal processing because of the book's claims on the back cover.The examples are not simple and clear, they're simplistic. The MATLAB integration feels forced. The book has a thrown together feel about it. This book is maybe better as a review of signal processing, but definitely not an introduction. If this is going to be your textbook, then start searching for supplemental material. Check out Joyce Van de Vegte's Fundamentals of Digital Signal Processing as a better alternative."
1,Concepts in Signals and Systems,"Very unconventional method of portraying how to do things. The methods to solve the questions at the end of each chapter are insubstantially reviewed in the chapter. This is a terrible book unless you already have a PhD in filter design. If you are a beginner like me, avoid this text at all costs."
1,"A SUBSTANTIVE, SURPRISING LET DOWN...","Over-arranged. Over-produced. Over-everything.What a brilliant artist.What a complete, over-blown let down.What a disappointment."
2,Real Different,"Okay, let me lay this down on ya...This dude is different, I bought the CD today and I popped it in the car stereo, the first track is just plain nauseating until the tuba part comes into play and the it's just confusing. The only part that redeemed the album somewhat was 14 Street. That is why the album gets a two."
1,I WANTed 2 like this Album,Mr. Wainwright's musical reputation had finally reached me via newspaper and Internet.Friends in SF have seen him in concert several times and sang his praises--I always took note of the name but never really followed up with a listen.I listened to the songfiles here and was shocked at RW's vocal quality. It is not my style at all!BUTCheck out Alexi Murdoch and Damien Rice--FANTASTIC singer-songwriters!
1,Monotony to the Extreme,"This is my first Rufus Wainwright CD so I want to give the guy the benefit of the doubt.However, I found this album to be nauseatingly boring. Rufus does not have sufficient modulation to his voice so it sounds like he's holding notes way too long till they actually make your head hurt with the repetition.I'm sorry I bought this CD and wish I could get my money back."
1,F*ckin' Terrible,"I have never heard anything that has wanted to fall asleep, cry, and kill myself at the same time. Bad song writing and wishy-washy lyrics make for a bad listening experience. I would only recommend this to my ememies and fans of the super obscure. I have no idea how this guy got signed and even more how he didn't get dropped.Overall view :("
3,"Nothing Wrong With It, But It's Not His Best (3.5 stars)","Really good disc in a year that is giving us some really great discs. Rufus seems to have morphed his previous records into one, topping it off with a more slickly, produced sound. A trait that sometimes enhances a tune, and sometimes hinders another. Some highlights include the parade-tempo of Oh What A World, Movies of Myself and Beautiful Child. The lyrics are typical Rufus, but as I've read here before, they aren't as strong as his previous releases. Not a major fall-out or anything, just a little more one dimensional. Again, no biggie.If your buying Rufus for the first time I suggest you start at the first record and work your way up to this one. It's a natural progression that's quite the path to follow, but rewarding in the end."
5,"I didn't think he could top ""Poses""",In fact I've scarcely heard the whole thing because I can't get enough of the first three tracks.I do however have a quibble - although the production is in general very good -- lush and full -- I thought that there was some room for improvement in the mastering process. I felt as if they hadn't listened to it through enough sets of speakers to properly shelf the various instruments.
5,Career Highlight,"Released in the fall of 2003, Rufus Wainwright's third album took his listeners by surprise since there was more of a gap between his first and second albums. While those two records established Rufus as an unprecedented, undeniable force in chamber pop music, it's not until this record that the sound comes full circle. The music is a lot more lush, as is the production, which manages to sound slick at the same time, which is an enormous feat. It almost feels like a magic trick, this marriage of pop music with classical elements, territory that was to be pushed to the max in the second volume of the Want CDs. Favorite tracks are 14th Street and most especially Beautiful Child. That song is so very cool. Essential hearing."
4,A BARD'S TALE,Talented Rufus Wainwright in his third album proves that those people who experienced his music and his voice years ago for the first time were right to believe in him. A modern troubadour who has a lot to give in music. I recommend this cd it is a new dimension and without doubt something exceptional.
4,"Wonderful, but I expected more","First let me state that Rufus Wainwright is brilliant and that I absolutely love this album. It deserves every one of its four stars. The only negative thing about Want One is that it is not as good as Wainwright's previous two albums.The style remains very individualistic. He still doesn't sound like anyone else, but he's moving closer to the pop realm and farther from the pseudo-operatic roots. The lyrics aren't quite as engaging as the previous albums' (though they are still brilliant) and they are harder to make out (though that is why we have a lyrics booklet!)All around I'd say this album is brilliant though, and I am certainly buying the second half of it. (Why didn't they just trust the fans and make a two disc set???) Anywho, hope this helps!"
3,"Not as good as ""Want Two""","Although I love Rufus' voice, I think this CD is not than good.""Want two"" and ""Poses"" are much better"
5,took me a few listens but....,"rufus is the real thing. with talent to spare. if you like him, buy it, don't wait."
3,"2.5 Stars, Really","I had very high hopes for this album because I enjoyed his first two albums so much (""Poses"" is excellent); I was disappointed however.If you've heard his previous two albums, I can compare this one to a couple of songs: ""Foolish Love"" on his debut album, and ""The Consort"" on Poses. The songs are blandly uniform.Tracks 1,4,8 and 11 are worthy of a return listen, but the rest are simply rehashed ideas that detract, rather than add to, the orginal.If you like the slow Rufus, then you'll like this one very much. Good music to fall asleep to, I guess."
2,Disappointing effort from an amazing artist,"""Want One"" is a great album for those that enjoyed the last half of ""Poses"". It is full of pop-style ballads and very little piano and strings. Although, his guitar pop tunes are alright, he is too talented to sell out and make radio-friendly music. The baroque style that he perfected on the first album and the first few tracks of Poses is only noticed on the first track of ""Want One"". I was greatly disappointed by this album and I truly wish he would go back to his old style on the next album."
1,Give me a break,"On his first album he was a young avant-garde prodigy with endless possibilities. On his second (and by far, best) album, he realized some of the possibilities weren't endless, but he still maintained a wink over his glare of grim acceptance. On this album, he fails musically for the first time, and stumbles over lyrics so trite and just plain bad (and I quote, ""You walk alone in the valley of life, In the shadow of love under the trees of happiness"") that one wishes he'd go back on drugs. Seems for some, writing about what you hope life will be like works out better than writing what your life actually is. Poses is one of my favourite albums ever, this is only one of the albums i've most been dissapointed by in my life. Let's hope Want Two goes back to the days when Rufis was indulging himself physically, not musically. Otherwise, i'll never 'want to' hear another word uttered from his mouth."
5,Thank-you Rufus!,"Rufus' third album will not disappoint any of his longtime admirers and it might even bring new fans to his unique musical signature. In Want One, Rufus is keeping with the tradition of grandeur and grace. The full orchestral sounds accompanied by multi-layered voices are there along with the gorgeous, pure and simple ballads. His voice has never sounded better. Want One is definitely more accessible, although I don't know if Rufus will ever be truly accessible to everyone, than his last two albums. There are glimpses of Queen, the Beatles, and Elton John. Not bad for someone who is only thirty!Want One is my favorite of the three so far but I think that is just because it is so fresh. I will go back to alternating between all three, appreciating them all the same while enjoying their own distinct differences. Thank-you Rufus for making such great music."
4,Still First-Rate,"I agree (...)that this album wasn't as good as Poses. That being said, this is still a great effort and I am enjoying listening to it. My favorite tracks are the first two. Oh What a World is a great sing-a-long track that samples Bolero. It struck me as funny that Rufus would have a TV commercial advertising his album, but yet it was appropriate that it aired during Queer Eye. I think I like I Don't Know What It Is even better - although it took me a while to realize that it was quoting song lyrics from the theme to Three's Company!!!"
4,Excellent compromise,"While I must admit to the purists that I'm a bigger fan of Poses than his eponymous album, I have to say, this album has a great mix of simple, uncluttered ballads typical of the first album, and the more elaborately produced, symphonic tracks of the second. I think we can all meet in the middle on this one."
1,dreck... total dreck,"overblown, hystryonic crap that sticks to your face like a killer piece of Limburger cheese and won't let go until you are dead. This kind of crap gives homosexuals a bad name."
2,"Oh, it's a rough life.","Was ""Miss"" Wainwright intoxicated when he recorded this album; or did he spontaneously develop a lisp and buck teeth. Who can understand anything he sings? HE SLURS. And Oh God!, it must be so hard to be ""Miss"" Wainwright. Such a tragic life is documented in these lyrics that I read in the liner notes (God knows you cannot understand them when they are slurred). If you like music that makes you want to slash your wrists open then this one's for you. Just make sure your drunk, have a lisp, and buck teeth when you listen so you may understand."
4,This is the album of a true artist.,"The quality in this music is what is missing in all the Micki-Dee's music we are forced to listen to everyday weather we want to or not.Although this isn't my favorite Rufus album, there is something very special about it. In 20 years when people rediscover him, this will be his defining album."
3,"Difficult to listen to, but not without its moments","I found this album somewhat a challenge to listen to. It lacks a cohesion that was absolutely wonderful on ""Poses"". It's a concept album? An opera? I suppose. It is well recorded and I do like it, but it requires patience to really take ahold of you. I became familiar with RW from Poses, one of my favorite cds and I was really amped for this subsequent release. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. I guess I expected more of the pop genius similar to what I heard before. Having just recently revisited this I am coming to appreciate the originality found here. ""I Don't Know What It Is"" - brilliant."
5,i want to have his baby .....and i am a man,I am speechless... this is the most beautiful thing i have heard in a very long time. tell everyone you know or will listen to you to get this. if i sound obsessed ... well i am.
5,running in the grass with my shoes off...,"Rufus has done us quite a favor: the guy who doesn't seem to fit in any catagory (is it rock? alt? folk? jazz? what is this?) has added a spash of broadway to an already ecclectic mix. A chorus of banjos, tubas bum-bumming, trumpets blaring, sit back enjoy the unicity of Rufus Wainwright.Some of these songs are beautiful, reflective and relaxing. Some make me want to run out in the yard with my shoes off (like a beautiful child). You'll find someting for every mood here.Wanting Want 2."
5,Sheer Beauty,"I like Rufus Wainwright, but his CDs were never the ones I would listen to days on end. At first, I listened to this CD and wasn't particularly fond of it. Then I listened to it again. And again. By this point, it was all over. The brilliant songs never leave my head. Every night I fall asleep listening to the perfect orchestrations. If there's one thing this album really illustrates, it's truth."
2,Smells great at first..,"After 2 days the smell is no longer and moths actually land and stay on this hanger. Mine also came in a wrapped in platic, lotta good it did me...my suggestion buy some at a wood store and chop it up make your own sachets and place them in pockets of clothing. Alot cheaper and works much better."
1,Ellis Peters would turn in her grave!,"For those of us who love the Ellis Peters books, this was an insult and an affront. Quite simply, the story was mutilated beyond all recognition. In fact, only the character names were consistent. Changing a few details for dramatisation is one thing, changing good characters into bad ones, and changing the whole crime is quite another. If the directors had wished to write a NEW sinister story, then they could have done exactly that. There was no need to ruin one of Peters' wonderful stories in the process.Frankly, the delightful and gentle quality of the Peters' stories provides their unique charm. This engineered dark, brutal atmosphere is totally alien to the original works, and as such has no place in this series.If you love the original books, do not buy this DVD. It will leave you irritated and annoyed."
1,"Entertaining, provided one hasn't already read the book.","This video has all the atmosphere one expects from a Brother Cadfael mystery. Unfortunately, it is completely unlike the book. While it manages to tell its own story well enough, the book was far superior, and it's a shame that the person responsible for adapting the book for television didn't treat it with more respect. Many characters are completely, wildly different than in the book, as is the plot. Some minor, inconsequential details were kept, and as far as I can tell, they are the only connection with the original story. In addition, anyone who is a fan of Hugh Beringar could just as well avoid this video, too, since he is hardly present--and when he is present, he is one-dimensional and has no rapport with Cadfael. Overall, a very disappointing adaptation."
1,Hollywood not BBC,"The BBC has always been good about staying with the book when basing a movie on a book. In this case, I have decided that this was a Hollywood production rather than the BBC. They took the book, ripped it apart, and glued it back together bleeding just as Hollywood so often does. They didn't even leave the names the same or the characteristics of the characters! It was extremely poorly handled from the aspect of during a book into a movie. I have never been so disappointed with the BBC than when I saw this video!"
1,This was awful,"The best Cadfael stories filmed were the ones that stayed true to the books, like Virgin in the Ice and One Corpse Too Many, those were absolutely wonderful. But this? The only thing they kept was the title, they made this an ugly, ugly story. I agree with the others, read the book and avoid this one like the plague!"
1,"Good book, bad adaption","I totally agree with the other reviewers. Stay away from this video and read the book instead. I understand that plots need to be summarized for video, but this book's heart was ripped out. The boy rewarded in the book for his faith and innocence is turned into a thief and liar.The story plods along and is missing the spark that many of the other videos have."
1,Riddled With Grammatical Errors!,"Although this book is informative thus far (only into Chapter 2), it is riddled with so many grammatical errors one would think they hired a child for an editor. I have never seen a published work so tarnished with errors. I find myself editing it in my head so as to understand the writers at times. Too bad I don't have a choice in the reading since it is the required text for my class."
2,Bias,"This book is being used to supplement college courses, but it should not be. I cannot get past the obvious bias in certain sections. Also, the book is lacking proper citations, often rendering sections unreliable. Out of the only 10 or so citations in the first chapter, 5 cited the authors previous books (not even the raw research). This book may be appropriate for nonacademics wishing to read an entertaining nonfiction work. Students and academics should skip it."
3,decent,I haven't used it yet but I think it will do the job. I know it won't break; the pulley holder is a lot more thicker than I thought it would be
4,Acid Canadian Psychedelia,"Get out the lava lamp, love beads and granny glasses! This classic 1967 LP was recorded in NYC at the height of the Flower Power Movement. It features David Dalton and Victoria Sackville on vocals and many other musicians of the day in a free-for-all bun.Recorded during the height of the Flower Power Movement, classic 1967 free form LP that features lots of sitars, chimes, harpsichord and other far out sounds. Even includes notes on how to spice up your parties using TV's, kaleidoscopes, and other ""natural things""Crazed and hilarious acid exploitation album that goes far out enough to become genuinely psychy, like a second tier Deep. One side is cheesy garage psych including the classic ""Play your game"", the other is 'meditation' featuring strange fairytales, Hare Krishna chanting, and more. The short spoken segment on Pebbles vol 3 that's puzzled many comes from this LP. A Canadian mono release exists."
3,i'm sure its great but haven't caught a thing with it yet,i love this lure. its the coolest looking one in my tackle box. i cast it out more than any of the others since i bought it a month ago. i havent' caught any fish on it in the hours that i've used it but i did manage to hook a giant rock and haul it into the boat using this lure. i'm confident no other lure i have could have done that.my guess is that it will perform and i'm optimistic about it still. i just haven't had it in the right water yet.
1,Not for string playing...,"As recently reviewed for 'Fingerboard Tape: Yellow' don't buy this to use on a stringed instrument. It doesn't stick for long and when it does, it takes the varnish off of the neck of the violin when you remove it. No good for anyone who rents an instrument at least... I don't think it is a product specifically designed for string playing... perhaps for a painter or artists."
1,As if anyone likes this,You know the music industry is in decline when people are giving this single a perfect rating. Run for cover!
3,Cool song,"hey, its an ultra wicked song, but i think they should have made the video suitable for kids as well coz when i watch it with my parents i always turn it off!! maybe next time shey should do two videos one for before 9pm!! wicked song tho!!"
5,Have not read a better book on the subject,The flow is good.Has been written in real layman terms which is good.I read it in one sitting at a store before and then bought it.(took me 4 hrs to read...)Like one reviewer said there are a few mistakes...But that doth not make this book bad at all.An excellent buy....it will be a ref for a loooong time to come.
4,Great into to UML design,"I think this is a great introduction to uml, following a real project from begining to end. It definitly made me think better about design and modelling. You get an insight into how to manage the whole project, from getting requirements to design.The only downside was the amount of filler about particular technologies, if you already know the basics of ejb,jsp,etc..., you'll probablly skip some sections.Overall the is a excellent book that gives you excatlly what is say it will."
2,Bad definitions but good case study.,"This book is very weak in defining basic UML and OO concept in the first chapter. It has bad definition for concepts such as ""classes and relationships"". Its definition of some of OO concept is hard to grasp for new comers to this field. At first I was going to use this book for some of the in house classes that I teach. Now I have decided to use it in conjunction with other books, since I am very pleased with its case study.If we fail to have a good basic definition and miss points in definitions of such concepts as Relationships between objects, then we cannot really provide a book that can be exclusively used for learning a concept such OO and the UML in enterprise Java.My suggestion to the writer is to omit the first chapter or rewrite it."
4,Early Dan Harmon/Rob Schrab Comedy Album!,"Before Scud: The Disposable Assassin, Heatvison & Jack, The Sarah Silverman Program, or Community, Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon were part of the Dead Alewives, a 7 person Milwaukee based comedy troupe. Take Down The Grand Master is their only album, released in 1996. It has 16 skits, 7 of which Harmon is credited as writer, 3 of which Schrab is credited as sole writer, and 1 more which they share writing credits on. This isn't the funniest CD ever made, but for a 15 year old collection with limited distribution, it holds up fine. Some parts are a bit dated, but other parts are still fresh. I'm a dedicated fan of Harmon and Schrab's more recent works, so I tracked down a copy of this CD just out of curiosity, and I'm glad I did. It's neat to have a little piece of their work before they really hit their stride."
4,Differentiation in a perfect world,"Another practical differentiation guide from Carol Ann Tomlinson.More than an introduction, this book contains lesson plans for a variety of elementary school subjects. For each subject, you can look at a complete instructional unit. Teachers looking for a step-by-step guide to creating differentiated lessons, look no further.I have to say, the first unit I designed this way took FOREVER. Don't get discouraged on the first lesson and don't think you have to differentiate everything right out of the box (the mistake I made the first time)."
3,Book,"I received the book in average time. The book was smashed in the middle. It still is in tact and usable, it just made the pages hard to turn."
3,Denzel and Denzel Plus are different!,"Careful if you have wide calves and order this. The product description is for the Denzel Plus boot, with wide calves. However, when I ordered from this page (from ShoeMall, through Amazon) they sent the regular Denzels, which are at least 2 inches smaller around the calf, so I can't wear them. From what I could see they would look great if I could zip them up! They aren't real leather, so keep that in mind. I didn't mind that since the price was low. But now I have to return them and find another pair that will really fit."
3,"nice boot, if you get the right one.","I ordered the plus calf, and was shipped the regular, so heads up on that. Otherwise they looked nice, a bit narrow in the foot though. I'm going to try to find them in the actual plus calf."
1,Terrible waste of $2,"These videos (the UTD openwater and UTD 5-DX essentials of recreational diving (Yeah, really sorry I rented 2 at the same time- live and learn), are just video of a guy floating at the bottom of the ocean, loosely demonstrating maneuvers. There is absolutely no helpful narration whatsoever to let you know the intricacies of what he is doing and why and how various different maneuvers will help in different situations, etc. There is virtually nothing of substance or help here. Occasionally a pause with some cryptic subtitles is the most you'll get. Chances are if you're an advanced enough diver to figure out what is going on, you don't need it. Both videos are also punctuated with an awful soundtrack that loops about every 30 seconds and NEVER stops. If you must watch to find out for yourself, do yourself a favor and put it on mute. You won't miss a word. There are none."
2,No melody. Only rhythm.,"I do not know this singer at all. I watched a photograph of CD jacket and bought it.Her songs seem to be a popular style recently.However, it was not my preference. Because there was not a thing to be impressed by.But it may be popular with youths."
5,The Top 40 in Topkapi,"Petrol Presents,for once,gets it right.""Sex,City,Music:Istanbul"" is one of those Arabian nights,harem-friendly hits.It's just the right combination of trip-hop,trance,ambient,and sensual grooves.Aziza A,Sultana,and Orient Expressions blend Turkish grooves with contemporary sounds,as heady as mint tea.The creative ""Buzz-phorus in secrecy"" by Oguz Kaplangi and ""Music"" by Demian are part of the variety.Brooklyn Funk's ""Istanbul in Twilight"" mixes reggae with Turkish sounds.This is pure Turkish Delight!"
1,Not very Useful,The book is cluttered and talks down to the reader. I didn't feel that I gained much USEFUL information in my job search. The author could have given the reader the same amount of information in about twenty pages of concise reading. Instead the reader must sift through pages of clutter only to gain a very few commonsensical tips.
5,A wealth of witty and practical advice,"In Headhunters Revealed! professional recruiter Darrell Gurney shares a wealth of witty and practical advice on how to reap the enormous benefits of being a ""hunted head"" in today's employment market; how to stay cool in the wrong job until the right one shows up; assessing and interviewing headhunters to find the best ones of you; how to manage your career like an entrepreneur for all it's worth; how to establish ""career partnerships' for a lifetime payoff; commanding the most from your ""employable assets""; and how to position yourself strategically in a recruiter's database. Highly recommended reading for all career minded men and women, Headhunters Revealed! demystifies what recruiters do and how best to take advantage of the recruitment system for the best job or corporate career you can get."
5,A must read for the candidate or aspiring recruiter,"I am only half way throught Darrell's book and have found his sincerity and candor to be refreshing. The content is realistic but yet inspiring, for it helps the reader feel more comfortable with a recruiter's methods and intent."
5,Excellent Resource for Job Hunters,"In ""Headhunters Revealed!"" Darrell Gurney demystifies the role of the professional recruiter. His book is comprehensive and easy-to-read (as well as humorous). He explains the advantages of using a recruiter, distinguishes among the different types of recruiters, advises on how to select a recruiter, and provides tips on how to work effectively with a recruiter. Most people are unfamiliar with the role of professional recruiters and often receive misleading information about them, as I have at seminars on career change. Mr Gurney is a straight-shooter who provides straight-talk about what professional recruiters can offer. If you are even remotely considering using a recruiter in your job hunt, this book is a must."
1,Not the real show,"This DVD is horrible. This show is from Japan, and yet there is no option for a Japanese-language track. What about the fans of Sailor Moon who actually want the ""real deal""? In the English version of the show, the plot is entirely different, entire scripts are changed, some episodes are completely cut out, and even the names of the characters are not the same. They have turned it into a completely different show. The company who did this DVD does a GREAT DISSERVICE to the pheonomenon that is Sailor Moon."
3,SWITCHAROO,The product advertsied is not the product shipped. I had the model advertised but the model shipped is a lessor quality ear bud. It works and the sound quality is OK but the craftsman ship of the one I received is much of much poorer quality.
4,"Not perfect, but well done","I find this book very useful for people who want to learn french and conjugate correcly. The book itself is not perfect, but the verbs are conjugated correctly, in all tenses. The most important thing about the whole book is that it includes the most used and important verbs. My only complaint is that the book is big, and because it's big, I should be hardcover."
2,"Good Layout, Weak Usability","The verbs are very well laid out in all forms, and the usage section for each verb is excellent. Unfortunately, the CD is only compatible with Windows computers (not mentioned anywhere on Amazon's page), which means you're stuck with the book itself for drills, and the book is rather bulky to carry around with you."
2,Where are the diacritics?,"The software for this book is reasonably well designed but there is no excuse for ommitting the accents and circomflexes, given how easy it would have been to include them: é à è ."
1,4-F Blues: a Novel of WWII Hollywood,"The title is intriguing & could have turned into a good read but it is shallow & fluffy. Few real people mentioned & all in all, will help you fall asleep."
4,Nostalgic fun and heart,"Having spent my early years in Hollywood, I especially enjoyed revisiting it through Mr. Rubin's eyes/ears. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, reminiscent of old movies and old longings, of a sense of life and and times that probably owe much of their appeal to our imaginations, then as well as now. The book begins before I was born, but stories told by relatives and friends support its credibility. I suspect that the book has strong bones of truth and that a few names might have been changed--out of kindness. A good read, say I. A couple of typos, but they don't trip up a reader who is just plain having fun!"
5,The First,"Motorheads first album is not with what most people consider the ""classic"" lineup, but offcourse Kilmister is in front. The album is not as hardcore as their later releases, and you can trace some jazzy tracks on this one. Some punk tracks can be found on this one too, like Leaving Here and Lost Johnny, and in my opinion the best version of Iron Horse ever.As previously stated this album is very different from later Motorhead releases, and if you like ie. Ace of Spades it is no guarantee that you will like they style on this album. I truly love this album and I find it one of their best albums ever(even though it is hard to choose one, they made so many good ones). Motorhead is one of the few hard rock bands that actualy got a believable punk attitude."
3,Embryonic Motorhead,"This is not what I was expecting from a Motorhead album, Lemmy doesn't sing lead on all the tracks (at least it doesn't sound like him on some tracks). This is clearly Lemmy looking for a direction to take his new band it's a hit and miss affair with ""Vibrator"" being particularly bad, this is more generic bluesy 70's rock than the bone crunching punk/metal sound they would develop over the next few albums. The Watcher and Motorhead are tracks from Lemmy's stint with Hawkwind and 2 out of only 3 written by Lemmy. Motorhead itself is the only track that sounds like what would come later and still rocks harder than most contemporary music. Compare this to the self titled 'debut' and a/b the songs that are on both albums to see the difference.A good album but steer clear if you looking for the heavier harder rock that Motorhead are known for."
3,If you're working through the canon....,"Well, obviously you wouldn't start here but if you are working your way through the complete catalogue, then you want to see baby's first steps. And they are rather unsteady, but as every journey starts with baby steps--ok, enough of the metaphors.Frankly, I bought this because I love the Pink Fairies as much as I love Motorhead. I'd have to say though that Larry Wallis was holding this project back, with a guitar sound stuck in the 60s rather than reflecting the punk energy that was appearing in London at the time. So, this is all pretty tame and never threatens to generate much heat. Its also funny to hear Lemmy sing, rather than growl as we love him today, on prototype versions of the song 'Motorhead'. So that's what the first verse is about--who knew?"
3,overlooked gem,"I always liked On Parole more than Motorhead (self titled), even though I like that album, too. It's Motorhead so it's hard not to like it. Anyways, this is the only recording of the Lemmy/Larry Wallis line up. I wonder what would have happened if this line up stayed together longer? If you've ever wondered how Lemmy made the transition from Hawkwind space rock to Motorhead's speed boogie, this is the key. If you like this record check out some Pink Fairies and Deviants.And be sure to check out Mighty High...In Drug City, too!"
3,Their worst album according to Lemmy - simply not true!,"""On parole"" is Motörhead's debut album although the record company didn't release it till the band's career took off a couple of years later on. This album is without doubt the most non-Motörhead sounding, but it's a very good effort. ""On parole"" includes the classic tunes ""Motorhead"" and ""Iron horse"" (a slower but amazing version compared to the faster live versions recorded later). Lemmy & Co also do a great job with the cover ""Leaving here"". I'd say that the material, which by the way is far more rock than metal, is rather good all the way. But beware - if you love ""Sacrifice"" this is perhaps not for you."
2,Young and On Parole,"I admit, I made the mistake of purchasing this as my first Motorhead album. It's not that it's absolutely terrible but this is not really the true form of Motorhead. Most of the songs are not that outstanding with the exception of Motorhead and the hilarious Vibrator. They were still finding their sound at the time and shortly afterwards went through a drastic lineup change. The album was also released four years after it was recorded. I decided to buy this at a store because the price was six dollars. (You probably would have done the same). But if you want to venture into the world of Motorhead, then look at their later albums like Ace of Spades, Overkill or Orgasmatron. On Parole may give you an impression of Motorhead that just isn't that impressive, when in reality they ended up being one of the fathers of the Thrash metal Scene."
5,Monument to Catastrophe,"I found the book to be well written, documented, and photographed. It's what they don't teach in schools. I would recommend for anyone, especially evolutionists."
1,Not a good buy,"I wanted something easy and convenient. Unfortenately this was not the blender for me, it just doesn't work. None of the attachements stay on and made it impossible for me to blend anything. I was very disappointed in this product."
1,[bad],"...Rachel stuck it in a cup of ice to make smoothies, the little bateries couldnt power that blade enough to make it through. Last time i ever buy a batery power kitchen appliance!"
2,Sub par effort for Will Oldham,"This album as listed is an instrumental album. Though I'm a huge fan of Will Oldham and own many of his albums and EP's from all of his various projects I can honestly say now that the main draw to his music is his voice. Sure the playing and instrumentation of his music is always acceptable, but without the voice it misses the critical impact that his other works achieve. Imagine what it would sound like if Leonard Cohen had come out with an instrumental album where it's just soft guitar playing without that nice poetic voice. If that sounds acceptable then this album is for you. In my opinion this album will probably only appeal to completists and die hard fans. If you're new to Will's music start with Viva Lost Blues."
3,A gift to the diehards,"A challenging album. A gift to the diehard Oldham fans. Tedious and interesting at once.I can't say whether I like it, but it still holds my attention."
1,Would not buy this product again..,"I had this product for a year now. The first few months it was great, then the problems started.Problem 1: I needed a new handle as it broke. I e-mailed Rival customer service to get a replacement piece (in black). They told me that the black handle was in stock and then proceeded to send me a white handle. I sent them several e-mails and never got a response.Problem 2: Unlike the previous review stating that the cooker just shuts off, my cooker just keeps on cooking it never switches to the warm cycle. The whole crock pot was extremely hot, I am now afraid to use it unless I am home, which defeats the whole purpose of using it.I could use any suggestions on which crock pot/slow cooker to purchase next. Any feedback would be helpful."
3,Hot Handle,My only complaint is the design of the lid handle. The stainless steal looking handle looks great but heats up with the crockpot. When the food it ready beware you may cook your fingers if you open the lid. Handle is just as hot as the contents of the crockpot. I usually tape a napkin around the handle when I'm serving a potluck dish since I know its hot but others may not.
4,Suchet is the Best Poirot!,"David Suchet is the best Poirot ever. We love all of his Poirot mysteries and intend to collect them all (over 65 at last count). The only problem with this set is Acorn Media does not include subtitles or closed captioning which makes it less enjoyable for my nearly deaf wife. I often stop the DVD and tell her what's going on, or if there's a crucial or funny line, I'll stop and make sure she gets it before moving on. Otherwise, fantastic!"
2,Mandarin is Spoken Here. Poor Translation.,"The DVD is presented in Mandarin, but the translator and audio English translation are pathetic. Virtually all that is attempted to be interpreted and conveyed in English is confused or muddled by the very poor translation quality."
2,Wasn't a good fit,"The product seemed to be made for a Chrysler Sebring, but did not fit my car. Otherwise the product seemed to be well made."
4,Satisfied with Amazon,I was very satisfied with my latest transaction with Amazon. The book I ordered came in a very timely manner and was in very good shape. Will certainly use this service in the future.
3,Great when new,I bought 3 of these in Apr 05. It's now Jan 06 and only 1 works as intended. The other two fail to erase or even recognize dvd-rw's that have been erased. They still work well as dvd players and record ok as long as the disk is brand new.
1,Very poor product,"The unit I got and briefly used was a piece of junk. It basically skips every single DVD I played in there. Does the same thing when recording/playback. Other than that, good luck trying to figure out any questions. Not to mention the customer service which is non-existant. I didn't even bother with the warranty and all that. Throw it in the garbage - it's not even worth recycling it."
1,Not worth buying,"Although I didn't use this recorder very often, it failed within a year. I also found that several recordings would work once or twice and then not work. These were recordings of VHS tapes that I wanted to capture on more permanent DVD. Very disappointing!"
4,5005X Liteon DVD recorder,Super easy to use dvd recorder has the EASY guider system so it far easier to use than most other brands of recorders.Makes great recordings.Has the added benefit of being Region FREE so it will play commercial dvds from around the world.
1,Not Happy with Lite-On DVD recorder seller,"I bought this Lite-ON 5005x DVD recorder that was second hand through Amazon. The sender or previous owner was helpful, however never discussed how the machine's door refuses to open regularly and during recording has a high pitched whistle that is annoying to say the least. This is the last product I will buy from Amazon that says ""Used models from...$"". I was robbed out of a hundred bucks buying someone's junk."
1,Reached for the stars.. landed in the mud...,"Well I bought this with high hopes it would work. But as I look at it in pieces on the floor I realized it might have been a false hope. Oh.. the reason it is in pieces is that it won't open the drawer anymore. I tried to see if I could get my disk out but the drawer is a sealed unit.The product worked for awhile but even then it sometimes made disks that would not work on other players. I tried a number of disk manufacturers on their accepted list but still it was hit and miss, mostly hit I must say, but it was frustrating.Well I am hoping once again. I just ordered theToshiba D-R400 1080p Up-Converting DVD Recorder... Boy I really want this one to work...."
2,No timed recording,"Unbelievable - no timed recording. You can't set this for a future TV show and walk away. It will only record a show that is on at the time you push the record button - unheard of. I have another Lite-on that won't always make a playable recording for another machine. Sometimes it's compatible and some times it's not. Lite-on makes great DVD transport mechanisms for PC's, but not this one. They need a little help in the ergonomics dept."
3,Die hard fans only,"the album itself is very experimental ranging from techno to the odd bit of hardcore. most of the tracks on this album are intrumental ones and there is only a few tracks with manson singing, for example chocloate factory. The chocolate factory on this album is not the original spooky kids one, but a remix of it and the same goes to the other songs aswell. THEY ARE RE-MIXES. but that doesn't make them any less bad, but still lacks the quality of the originals. the re-mixes offers catchy beats, dark techno and sometimes the odd bit of guitar.NOT RECOMMENDED FOR FIRST TIME MANSON BUYERS, ONLY FOR DIE HARD FANS. it's worth buying though"
2,Whattt!??,"I bought this hopeing for something Marilyn Manson-ish. Its all just weird techno and the songs are like, 11 minutes long. They get boring! Some of them are cool though and a few of them have Marilyn Manson actually singing, but hardly. Save your money for Mechanical Animals... not this."
5,A classic which MUST be reissued!!!,"Originally released in 1980, this all-time classic album contains the timeless hits ""La Rueda"", ""La Vecina"" and ""Separemos Nuestras Vidas"". Everything from searing-hot guaguancos to classic Cuban-flavored son montuno rhythms will be found here. Featuring a then-unknown Frankie Ruiz and Jaime ""Megui"" Rivera on lead vocals this was one of the best Salsa albums of the early 1980s which remains an undisputed classic to this day. Universal Music Latino MUST reissue this album!!!"
2,A simple but effective story.,"Basically, an android figuring out her place in the world, and if she can have emotions. In the end, she becomes quite possessive of her human male friend.Strictly low budget. The special effects are not that great, but then, not many are needed. For the most part, this is an android story that's been told before (think Galaxina, all the way up the new Galactica Cylons). The acting is not that bad, only a couple of sets are even needed (a lot of the film takes place outside on an alien world).The female android is attractive in a simple way, wearing a bland black jumpsuit. Maybe by altering her outfit, the producer could have made the movie a bit more spicy. LOLAnyway, this film might be worth watching once, but that's about it."
1,Time burner,This is what you watch when you have exhausted all your other entertainment outlets. The FX were very basic.Watch at your own risk. Do not expect a Terminator type ripoff.
4,Homegrown,"Really good for a low budget film. Special Effects were OK, again small budget. Acting was pretty good for unknown actors. Direction was good. The story flowed right along."
2,Not the movie I expected,Again was not what I expected. Slow to start and slow to end. But that happens sometimes. So that's it
2,just passing time,"The movie has the feel of a bunch of friends and their families getting together and makinga movie. No Hollywood or mid range production company values. The script was probably written by committeat a bar-b-que picnic table on a summer day.The script is sparse, but the story isn't too bad. It ends as expected.I do have to say I liked the lead 'actor'. He was baby faced and had an innocent persona that made himeasy prey for misdirection. Just remember the cast took it seriously even if you don't. I would give it a C- because it could have been much much worse."
2,Class C Movie,I normally like to watch B movies... but I could not watch this one for more than 10min. sorry but I really call this a class C movie. I did like the spaceship flying through.. space. It looked pretty cool. The planet names threw me off from the beginning and made it feel like a fantasy sci-fi movie -- which is really not my flavor.
2,Mostly lame,"Wouldn't go so far as to say I hated it, but it certainly was not a good movie. Not too bad to kill time if you are bored and watched most of everything else on prime."
3,Not complete enough,"This book is far from ""encyclopedic."" As the owner of a business that sells potted succulents and cacti, I was hoping for a book that would enable me to identify various varieties of plants. This book was only moderately helpful, largely because only some of the plants discussed had accompanying illustrations. Also, while the illustrations are lovely, actual photographs would have made the identification process easier. Still, I use the book and am glad to have added it to my reference library."
3,not the best,"This is definitely not a stellar dictionary. The grammatical information is sparse and difficult to decipher (on the Czech to English side, at least), and at times secondary or tertiary definitions are not included when they should be. A number of times I encountered entries that were outdated or just plain wrong. Leda publishing puts out a much better dictionary for students of Czech."
3,not as good as her first,"When I got this album I was a little disappointed. Most of the songs on here are generic pop. There just isn't that many beautiful songs on this album as on her last one. It is more upbeat than the last one though. I was hoping for more pretty songs though. The best songs on here are 'Angel in Disguise' and 'Safe in a Crazy Wolrd' in my opinion. The other songs arn't bad but they don't suite my taste. The lyrics on most of the songs are good and meaningful, that's not the problem. I think the music itself sounds a little over processed and a little too much like regular pop. I think the cymbals(drums and percussion) are over used, In my opinion they ruins some of the songs such as 'The Birthday Song' and 'Every Beat of My Heart'.Still it's an ok album and personally I think it's worth it if you can get it used on Amazon. It just isn't as special as her first one. Listen to longer samples at CDBaby.com ."
1,Kobec,Poor watch with extremely poor materials used. Battery drains wvery 4-6 months and poor timekeeper. Very Glossy and heavy case hides poor workmanship. Retails for approx $100 over web against ( laughed so much ) RRP $850 or thereabouts. Where do they get that figure from ???. I have bought a great quality fake Rolex for $90 and no one can tell the difference.
5,Helpful as ever!,"The claims by another reviewer fails to mention this product, but instead trys to debunk one of the authors of this product. Plus, i've never seen such a ""convicted felon"" help out so many people so much, in so many areas, while maintaining millions of satisfied customers! As for me, i'm another satisfied customer. This product helped me improve greatly. I've always heard about others finishing books in just a matter of hours, which would have taken my old self more than a week. The product works, and others, like myself, prove this. I would gladly recommend this to many."
3,Sincere project at increasing speed and comprehension...,"until I was ambushed by a perfunctory nutrition lecture by Kevin Fraudeau towards the end of the course. I found it very, very odd and i speculate that it was an ultimatum that Fraudeau made so Berg can get his course to the public... though I could be wrong.As for the course: This thing was collecting dust for 10 years before I recently used it. I calculated my speed at 600 wpm, but my main motive was to read for increased comprehension; both increased noticeably during the early part of the course and I was wholly impressed. The comprehension tricks do not appear hyperbole and I anticipate impressive results with practice.Berg's jokes when coupled with his heavy Brooklyn accent were also enjoyable.**I read that Howard Berg was indicted in '98 for stating that a girl with brain damage successfully used Mega Reading... guessed Kevin rubbed off on him?"
4,Wonderful,I thought the book was wonderful. I felt a little short changed at the end. The book was wonderfully written and I would recommend it to a friend. Good Job.
5,Required Reading!,"The entire Men at Arms series are fascinating books with incredible detail. If you are a newbee to military history or an expert, you will love reading these."
4,Sabatier Cannes Stoneware 13-inch au gratin,This is a very pretty dish. It cooks well and is great for serving in.
3,One size smaller than the other,"I bought these shoes in size 9 and was all excited, however, when I received them one side was much smaller. Unfortunately, I am currently not in the US and it would cost me too much to ship back, so I am stuck with it. Note however, the size that fits feel really comfortable."
5,Sailor Jupiter Comes thundering in!,I'm looking forward to this DVD's release. The best Season of Sailor Moon. I've wished for this day and it came true! Hopefully they'll get with the program and produce hybrid DVDs as well as Toonami editions! Which I'll gladly purchase!
1,"um, in the washer at the moment because it came in ziploc bag","This must have been a used item. No tag and after removing it from the cheap ziploc bag sandwich bag, i planned to throw it right in the washer, and then noticed that upon taking another look, the seam at the crotch looked like it was torn, probably from previous wear and tear. Disgusting, especially after considering the cost for the item plus s&h."
3,"Wonderful Book, worth the $5.00 I paid for it but in very poor condition.","I was excited to find this wonderful book 'A Modern Herbal' by Mrs. Grieves, as I had both volumes and somehow they came up missing. I didn't realize that you could get both volumes in one. I should have thought that there may have been something wrong with it when it was only $5.00. When I got it I found that the cover was almost off, completely loose from the back. I didn't remember reading that when I ordered it. Oh, well, at least I have the content, and that is the most important thing!Laura Earl - Idaho"
5,A marvelous little book,"If you have kids, if you teach kids, if you just want to understand kids, this is a must read. It brings out what hasn't changed much about high school in 40 years, and what has. My wife and I have taught for 30 years, and this book taught me plenty. We have raised two wonderful children and I understand them each a little better thanks to this book. Before I had even finished it, I had started a mental list of people on whom to press this book. Now that I have finished it, the list is longer."
1,Absolutely Infuriating,"I could go on and on about how much I hate this book. The arrogance, the narrow-mindedness, the self-pity.I'm definitely what people would describe as a ""geek"" (unless I'm not ""counter-culture"" enough for you), yet I absolutely hated everyone I read about in this book. Apparently, from what Katz tells us, we are to believe that geeks are super special superhumans who are just too good for ordinary people. Well, guess what - geeks aren't really that unique! Yes, I personally think that they are more interesting and are people I would more likely want to be friends with, but I could hardly go around espousing it as fact."
2,Disappointing!,"I read ""Geeks"" and then followed it up with ""October Sky"" (or ""Rocket Boys) by Homer Hickam--the story of ""geeks"" in West Virginia set in the late 1950's. It is by far the better story. Read it for yourself.I found no heart in ""Geeks,"" no real character development. No ""Why!"" Katz seems more interested in himself. Perhaps a son he didn't have. He has nothing to say about his daughter who is undergoing similar traumas with college and career plans.The story is about Katz, more than Jesse and Eric. I'm sorry, I wish I knew Jesse and Eric better. I don't!"
4,Inspiring,"This book serves as a reminder that geeks, although treated as outcasts, are needed by nearly all companies and institutions. Other than one chapter where the author, Jon Katz, seems to ramble on about something that, in my opinion, is off topic, the book is very well-written and easy to read. A must-read for all geeks, especially for those who are in or have recently graduated from high school."
3,"Firmly ""okay"". Not the best, but not bad.","It's difficult for me to say much about this book. The story is short, easy-to-read, and empathic as hell, but really didn't move me to tears, as it did prior reviewers. Katz well describes the turmoil that exists inside his young friends, and creates within the reader a strong empathy. However, even as a geek, I am compelled to agree with a prior reviewer who described the story as a ""story about disenfranchised youth""... who happen, in this case, to be geeks. I did not get the feeling that the book really had anything to do with geeks, but could be about any pair of isolated persons, following their hearts to ""ascendancy"". The book spoke to me, but I suspect it would speak to any person with a past or present filled with isolation. It's an easy, quick read, and well worth your time, but it just didn't get to me. Thus, it's stuck with an okay - 3 stars."
5,most touching story i've read,"i had identified a lot with the characters in this book. i was isolated, confused, and angry with many aspects of my life. this book accurately conveys all the thoughts, emotions, and experiences that myself and others in high school (actually middle school) had been through. i also identified with the tale of overcoming obstacles in his life to achieve a higher education. therefore i might be somewhat biased. his superb description of the lives of jesse and eric is absolutely amazing. i highly recommend this book.i 've reread this book at least 3 times since i bought it."
2,"Self-promotion, and missing the point","Mr. Katz thinks he knows all about geeks, and wants to put them under glass and show them to everybody like circus animals in this book, but misses the point entirely. Like his previous books, his writing style is convoluted and unnecessarily pedantic, and will only contribute to giving unnecessary negative attention to geeky people. Like his upcoming book ""voices from the hellmouth"" where mr. Katz republished many excerpts from slashdot without their author's consent or prior announcement, this book only serves his self-promotion."
4,Excellent Read,"This book was a great read~ I appreciated the insight and time brought forth to this real life journey of two people: which really represents much more in a larger picture. It's kind of a feel-good story of life chapters, as well as an interesting true depiction of where things are headed on a larger scale. Kudos~"
5,Eye-opener,"I highly recommend Geeks. The story is about two teenage geeks. The message is about alienation, redemption and assimilation. Fascinating because of its engaging characters and its insights into so-called ""geek culture"", the book is enlightening, particularly to parents of adolescents, on an entirely different level. Our society nurtures only certain ""types"" while others ""types"" may provide the keys to the future of our culture. Although I share the view of several previous reviewers that the style of writing is somewhat breathless at times, the story being told and the message being delivered are important issues of our time."
4,Tie a Tie,This book was a fun and long book for me to read but it was wearth it. The one thing I like about this book is how much Jesse and Eric use the internet. One thing I like the most about them using the internet is when Jesse uses Alsa Visa to find out how to tie a tie. I'm just learning that now when I'm young so I don't have to search the internet to tie a tie. And when they moved to an apartmet so they could get faster internet accses. I personaly enjoyed this book.
2,It has happened `` Geeks`` have started their comeback!,"It has happened Geeks have started their comeback!Geeks was an ok book. It is not my favorite book but it has some good parts. I would rate this book two stared, because it didn't catch me at all. There were two main charters Earic and Jessie. As you can tell they both are geeks. I think that they should have made the story back further before Jessie was in the geek club. I think that this book could of used more action in it. It would have been better if there was less swearing but it goes with Jessie's background. I think that this book would be better for teens on up because it is more difficult for some people. Well this is all I have for this book good luck on the book Geeks."
2,Best taken with a grain of salt...,"This book is certainly not the most painful that I've ever read, and I can't recommend that others steer clear of it. But it might be better with a disclaimer. Perhaps the following:Warning! Readers should be apprised that not all geeks are criminal misanthropes who can only get ahead with the assistance of modestly talented, self aggrandizing writers. The individuals and environs depicted herein should not be construed as exemplars of all geeks or geekdom. In fact the inclusion of the word ""Geeks"" in the title is an editorial oversight, since this book is about the struggles of two disenfranchised young men, and sheds very little light on how their being geeks makes them different from the thousands of other intelligent, disenfranchised young men and women who are not geeks."
1,If you are bored... read somethings else!,"Tbe blunt truth about this book is that it is a poor read. Among the many flaws that this book had was there was no ""real"" story to tell."
1,Blecch! Untrue.,"This book is pretty naive. Work for the local computer shop, don't go to college and you will end up at the University of Chicago (?)Yes, and you might win the lottery too ;-)These guys told Katz a lot of lies about the Internet and various kinds of computer hardware and he just stuck it right in the book.Shame on you kids."
2,As sexy as sausage&sauerkraut,"This album is hardly an accompaniment to Teutonic tenderness,but it's more Generic Club Music with the occasional German sounds&even; the German language.Ach du lieber!It would be perfect background music for Hot Topic,or the teenagers' clothing sections at malls.The few highlights of this supposedly bootylicious beerhall Berlin soundtrack are the trance-y ""Still"" by the Quarks,""On my own"" by Ulrich Schnauss and ""The Things you Said"" by Contriva.The rest is pretty awful.There's the hip-hop (with some German expressions tossed in) ""Soft Shoe Snoozin'"",the generic club songs ""Disco Clown"" (a disturbing image comes to mind),""Comic Menuetto"",Barbara Morgenstern's bizarre ""Operator"" (Piano Version),and the incredibly obnoxious Jahcuzzi and Rhythm King AHF.Listening to this supposedly ""sexy"" ""German"" club music helps one understand why Benedict XVI,the German-born Pope,prefers classical music&would; rather play Mozart."
3,Picture is a little deceiving,"I ordered this watch based on description and photo. When it arrived I realized the photo was somewhat misleading. The watch is nice but thicker and larger then I expected. The strap looks nice but I am worried that after a month of wearing the watch, I am starting to see some signs of wearing on the strap.Build quality is good and I wear it everyday. It feels solid.I am rating it a 3 as it is a nice watch overall but I would recommend you compare other watches in the same price category before going for this."
5,A Classic.......,"Well...this book is definitely a ""must have"" book on diffraction if you're interested in this field. Dr. Guiner,for those who are not familiar with diffraction, was one of the leading scientist in the field and contributed much to the development of x-ray diffractometry. The book is definitely not for the beginner. However, for someone who has made his/her initial steps into the world of x-ray crystallography, this book might be rewarding to read for it discusses the fundamentals rigorously. The book is very affordable as well, making it a very attractive buy indeed...I highly recommend it."
5,A must,"Together with Warren's ""X-ray diffraction"", this small but complete textbook on x-ray diffraction is a must. Guinier (the same one of the Guinier-Preston zones) explains with detail and completeness the mathematical and physical treatment of diffraction in ideal and real crystals and polycrystalline materials."
2,Not what I had hoped.,Too much talking by host. Not enough movement. I wanted to use this in my classroom and it is too chopped up between talking segments and the actual usable video.
4,Good book for those who want to make money cleaning,"Readable, informative, and encouraging for someone who likes cleaning and would like to start a cleaning business. This book displays sample charts of start-up costs. It also covers important tasks such as: tenders and bidding on contracts, timing your cleaning tasks, promoting your business at trade shows, inventory control and other important things you should know. It is the bible of the home-cleaning business! Not only does it cover the business side but it also gives some helpful, time-saving cleaning tips and recommendations on environmentally friendly cleaners."
3,The Gitem Gyrls,"I didn't think I would like the movie, but the movie turned out to be ok. The movie was well written, not too cheesy."
1,Thin and light,"I too was disappointed with this book. There's not much substance here, especially if you already know a bit of VB/VBA programming. Half of the book reviews basic VB/COM concepts, syntax and programming practices. I bought this book because I already know VB and I am starting an ArcGIS programming project. I learned more looking at the ESRI provided samples and poking around their excellent support forum and sample code web site... Just by tinkering around with ArcGIS in the time it took for the book to arrive, I built sample applications that are way beyond those presented in Razavi's book.The book doesn't really give you enough information to begin to grasp the ArcObjects data model. If you're going to do any serious ArcObjects programming, you'll need the ESRI reference book ""Exploring ArcObjects"" ... which is also included in electronic format on the ESRI CD's, but it's so big that the paper version is easier to use. {This refers to the 1st (2002) edition.}"
1,How did this make it to print?,"Other reviewers have done a good job of stating the flaws in this book. I'll also throw my vote in to say that this book is awful, hoping that people read these reviews when deciding whether to purchase the book. My opinion was so negative of this book, that I returned it for refund. The book is full of too many typos, incomplete code samples that won't run, and incomplete logic that it is essentially more confusing than helpful, in my opinion. Definitely not recommended.If you want to learn to program ArcGIS, look for Robert Burke's book instead. It is a real winner."
5,good deal,"Like the sharpener, does a good job. I probably should buy better bits to start with, but if I'm gonna break them anyway. This gives me more chances to accomplish that."
4,I would buy another.,I bought mine a year ago and have sharpened my drill bits a couple of times now. It does an excellent job. Did over 40 bits at first and then 6 months later did about 15 of them so far. It leaves a very nice edge on them and they seem to cut better then when the bits were new. I think it may be the new angle this device it putting the bits at.
1,drill bit sharpener,"this drill bit sharpener is a piece of junk, they all are.i should have returned it but to late now."
3,Drill Bit Sharpener Review,"Have not used it to much yet... It stopped working about half hour after... Think a thermo overload device stopped motor...It is ok for small bits, still learning how to use it... Thanks"
3,"Nice Case, but smaller than advertised.","The Rezo 30 is aan attractive, well made, and user friendly case. Unfortunately I have to return it because it is too small for my camera.The published dimensions vary slightly between the Amazon site and the LowePro site, but I found that neither were accurate. The camera pocket depth on the case I received was only 1.25"" and the outside width measured 2.75"" rather than 2.75"" representing the interior dimension.The Rezo 30 would have received 5 stars had the dimensions been consistent with those published."
5,Perfect fit for the Flip video,"I bought this for my Flip video, which came with only a velvet pouch. After comparing all the Rezo models for just the right size, across multiple sites to make sure I was getting the right dimensions, bought this one. It fits perfectly! If you're looking for a case for your Flip video, get the Rezo 30."
5,The perfect digital camera bag,"As expected, great quality digital camera bag. The Lowepro Rezo must be an updated model of an earlier digital camera bag Lowe makes. It's a little boxier than the previous model but works equally well for my ultra compact camera as well as my bigger Panasonic TZ5. Sturdy, durable fabric, the right pockets in the right places. Totally happy with my purchase."
3,Takes time....,I was given a rave review of the product by my cousin in Fl. so I bought three packs. I followed directions with no luck and finally dumped an entire package into 10 lbs of seeds. The PA squirrels do not seem bothered by the product andthe birds are not visiting as often.
1,No Stars for Squirrel Away!,This product appears to be nothing more than cayenne pepper powder. I used it in my birdfeeder and the squirrels seemed to love it!
1,Not Enough Stuff,"This stuff is nothing but cayenne pepper, which you can buy at an Indian Food Store by the pound. You'll need a pound of it to work anyway, not 1.5 ounces. Rain washes it away, see, and the critters might sneeze a little, so you have to put it on thick to really irritate them. This small bag is a joke."
4,mitsubish wd-62627,"i have owned this tv 5 months .it has a good clear picture ,lamp is a little slow to heat up and the net command does not work"
2,not 1080P,I bought this set looking for 1080p. when i pluged in my xbox360 and turned on the 1080p option it did no work. i then looked in the tv manual to find that there is no mention of 1080p it stopped at 1080i. sucks huh
4,nice lamp,"Nice lamp, but it would be even nicer if it was totally flushed. It was received all in one piece without any defects or damage. Easy to mount. I recommend it."
1,I took way too long to receive this product,"All I'll say is that I like the product but will never order it from 911 again. I had to contact them two or three times asking them where is my product? I have ordered items from Europe, Canada and China and received it faster than 911 and they are in the USA where I am."
5,Love this oil!,"Emu Gold oil is the best emu oil out there, in my opinion. It absorbs nicely and fairly quickly into my dry skin. I use it under my eyes very lightly daily under my eye makeup and it seems to help keep the wrinkles flatter. I also use it all over after showering. My dog loves to lick it off my skin which is perfectly acceptable as it is a natural product and can be taken internally. I recommend this product."
4,emu oil,I love emu oil. I was so happy when I received my product. Helps great with people that have dry skin. Wish the product was shipped faster. It took a while to get to me.
3,duffy's cut,"loved the subject matter -- the writing style - not so much. obviously written by two or more writers. much of the material was repetitive and overlapping. written like a collaborative research paper with little or no editing.this is a great story but is delivered in a flat, didactic manner -- defeating pleasure or entertainment."
3,Mostly a Travelogue,"Anderson was a former Confederate soldier who was invited by Emperor Maximilian to come to Mexico on a surveying expedition to scout possible sites for a colony of southerns after the Civil War. As a travelogue of 19th century Mexico it is not without its charms, and as a piece of historical documentation on American attitudes at the end of the Civil War it has some value, but as a read, it is not that great. If you are a student doing research into the period, it is a good text to look through, but otherwise it is probably not suited for casual readers."
2,"Nice, but they are copies.","These aren't a bad deck, but they are a set that was printed from a copy. I got 2 decks, when I only asked for one, which I like. But I was hoping for an ACTUAL set of the ORIGINAL cards. One of my friends was issued a deck back in 2003, when he deployed to Iraq, and has since lost the deck. I was hoping to get the original ones, that are still sometimes issued when military members are deployed to the Middle East. So while yes, they are a good copy, I am disappointed that they are just a copy, and not a very sturdy copy. The box the cards came in fell apart when I was pulling them out, and the backside is more pink than true camo. All in all, not too bad for the price."
3,Strange Album,"The album's strange symbol title was adopted by Prince as his official name a short time after the album's release. The album contains some of the strangest music in Prince's career. The album is something of concept album and it has some interludes with a woman's voice (Kirstie Alley) that explain this concept. The songs are pretty good including the super funky ""Sexy M.F."", ""The Morning Papers"", ""The Flow"", ""7"" and ""Blue Light"". The album is fairly inconsistent, but the sheer strangeness of it makes it worth a listen."
5,Best latin american film I've ever watched,"I saw this film in 1987, when I was ten. Since then I've not seen a better latin american movie. This is a great movie, for me the best work from Eliseo Subiela. A couple of years ago there was an adaptation of this story filmed in Holywood (I think the name is Kpax) I didn't watched that one...beacause the original movie is just perfect."
5,Rantes = John From Cincinnati???,I too cherish my VHS copy of this amazing film. Why this hasn't become available on DVD escapes me. I dust off the tape about once a year. Time to get it out again now that JFC has only one ep left. I wonder if Mr. Milch has seen this?
4,"Interesting sci-fi predecessor to ""Dark side of the Heart""","This movie, from 1986, was the predecessor to the movie that gave Argentinian director Eliseo Subiela international fame. It can be considered a sci-fi movie for the most part and, the loud music (by Pedro Aznar) aside, it's able to capture and keep the audience's attention. The story is clever: a supposed mad man claims he comes from outer space and takes his treating psychiatrist through a journey of self-discovery and questioning of his life and the stupidity of humankind.The ending could have been better worked out, however, it's a very interesting movie, deserving of four stars."
2,"""write-on"" feature needs work","The globe seems sound enough structurally, but the pen that came with it didn't seem to actually have any ink in it. I tried my dry-erase whiteboard pens on it, and wasn't able to completely erase them, even with white board cleaning solution. Disappointing for a $50 globe."
3,Hey Amazon: Fix this.,"I enjoy the series. However, Season 2, episode 4 -- part 2 of the second episode to be precise -- won't load. That sucks. Wonder how it ends?"
2,Not so good,As per first season comments - Pirot is a much better production. Acting was good but rest was not same standard as Poirot.
3,A little show biz for Campion,"""Dancers in Mourning"" puts Campion in the company of the 1930s theater world, where everyone is a little off the wall and self-absorbed. It's like England goes Hollywood. They found actors who can actually sing and dance quite well. The women appear in typical dumpy 1930s styles (probably one of the ugliest eras in history) and Campion finds himself getting infatuated with one. Several explosive surprises in this episode, and it gets a little hard to follow what's actually going on and why."
2,ampion second season,Not worth the time. There is no CC or subtitles. Hard to understand Brittish accent. Thunbs down!.
5,Royal Brites Matte Business Cards,"I actually purchased my business cards from Sams Club, and they have since discontinued carrying Royal Brites. I loved them, they went through my printer with no problems, I printed on both sides and got the results I was expecting. I would recommend Royal Brites Matte Business cards to anyone who would like to obtain a professional looking business card."
5,Great Product,R. Ault must have gotten a bad batch of cards. These cards are great and tear apart easier than the more expensive brand. I'm very pleased with Royal Brites business cards.
5,Understanding Catholic teaching from Catholic sources,"The Scriptures; the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass; the real presence in the Eucharist; Mary; Purgatory; justification; the nature of baptism; priests. These are all subjects of many a civilized discussion (or heated dispute!) with our protestant brothers and sisters.The assembled essays in this book explain these and other issues in very clear and readable language. They serve well in explaining the Biblical and historical basis behind these issues.For the Catholic who wants to understand the faith better, whether it be for personal growth or to help defend the teachings against those who would criticize them, this book is for you.For the protestant who is willing to let the Catholic Church explain the Catholic Church, this book is for you too.A pretty easy read. Well worth your time!"
5,A must read for Catholics AND Protestants!!,"""Catholic for a Reason"" is probably the best book available to share with Protestant Christians. Too many times, Protestants object to Catholic doctrines because they do not 'understand' Catholic doctrines. This book gives the Protestant Christian a good overview of the historical and biblical basis for Catholicism. Read with an open heart and mind, this book should help Protestants come home to the Catholic Church. Reviewed by Gospel Truth Ministries"
5,"it was more information than i had hoped , great !!","great for building your basics ! and gives one very much depth, things you may never have known, but should !"
2,Dont buy this book,"Personally as a physical education teacher i feel that this book doesnt prepare you for half of the questions asked in the exam, and doesnt help you much at all with any essay questions asked in the test. It is missing alot of subject pedagogy and poorly prepares the reader to take the test. After paying $90 - $120 to take the test and paying $35 for the book i feel it is a complete waste of money as if you have no knowledge, or low knowledge of phys ed you will have to pay out another $90 and another $35 to retake the test and buy a book that better prepares you for the test."
4,"LRB ""Best Of"" Review","What a delight, this album really brought me back to a special time in my life. The music still holds up today. This is truy the CD to get if you're a true LRB fan. Only regret....tracks do not include ""Mistress of Mine"" and ""Please don't ask me"". Other wise this CD is really great."
4,CGI How-To,"CGI is the heart of what makes web-sites and can be useful for other projects. You do not need a book for simple application as you can just cut and paste with a fairly educated guess. But the day will come when you will want to know what you are doing and why. More still, when you are confronted with a unique application that cannot just be cut and pasted.This book is very comprehensive and come with a CD if you remember what a CD is. There is example in Perl and c. is aware if you go down the Perl rout that that animal is proprietary when it comes to outside help. Of course the book itself has practical examples and monochrome screen shots."
3,No online help,"There is a good deal of valuable information here for the intermediate perl programmer, but no online errata sheet is provided, and the book is not flawless. Plan on spending a fair amount of time debugging on your own."
2,Too simplistic approach,"I found the book not very rewarding to read, and I feel the writers try to explain too much. So I found a lot of material I could have come up with myself, and just a few new things. By explaining everything rightaway, they take away all the challenge and excitement from the programming and reading.The books q/a approach doesn't really appeal to me either and the fact that not all examples are available in C as they are in perl, is (to me as a C programmer) simply unforgivable.A good reference manual for only C would have been more usefull to me.I stopped reading the book after the first two chapters and have used the questions with the first few lines of explanation as programming exercises. So it wasn't totally useless afterall ;)"
3,Nice '60s feel...goofy,"All of Jerry's 1960's films have been released on DVD except this one and ""Who's Minding the Store"". Wonder what the criteria is on when to release them...looks like the VHS is out of print too...hmmmm."
3,Voices of War,"I felt that there was some liberal bias. They seemed to suggest that the Tet offensive was a victory for the MVA and that was not the case. They also suggested that the reason the Korear War and the Vietman War was lost was due to the enemies determination, instead of US political cowardice. However, I did like the coverage of the military nurses, which is long overdue. They saved many lives in terrible living conditions. It was worth buying just for that."
3,Lipsticks,"It takes a little while to know the quality of lipstick. After a couple of months, I can say that this brand is not great. Colors are not rich and they wear off fast. Nice case, but cases are not the reason to buy. I have bought other Guerlain cosmetics in person and they were always good. Maybe lipstick buying is not an online great."
1,Garbage,"How disappointing! Having build robust e-commerce sites in 90 days or less myself, I was hoping to find insight into the process. Methods or procedures that could be leveraged effectively to improve success. Instead this book offered nothing of value. I read it in less than 2 hours and sold it immediately.... Definite Avoid rating.I would recommend ""Web Redesign : Workflow That Works""by Kelly Goto, Emily Cotler..."
4,Fascinating insight into the personal side of atomic physicists,"This is an important story about the people who played key roles in the development of nuclear weapons. The interplay of intellectual challenge, moral reluctance, and fear of the enemy is examined in detail for numerous key players. The politics of weapons development is intertwined."
2,I Disagree With The World,"Phillip Seymour Hoffman's characterization is the only and lonely reason to see this film. Art design and some shots are OK, but the music is of the TV drama kind (sorrow represented by lonely piano accords) and the story fall flat right after the beginning. No character is really affected by the events, and I don't believe when they say they did because they're saying so. Probably ""In Cold Blood"" is a masterpiece, and if this movie is useful in some way is by prompting you to read that book."
3,Not going to win Academy Award,"However, it was a good movie. I enjoyed watching this movie and the brilliant lead role of Truman Capote played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Unfortunately, the story wasnt what I was expecting, as I had no prior knowledge of this story. It was eerily similar to Dead Man Walking, but Dead Man Walking was much better. It was well done, but definately wasnt one of the best of the year."
4,Soundtrack CD?,"I haven't seen the movie, but have read ""In Cold Blood"" and several early reviews. All have been very praiseworthy. But I also was captivated by the sampling of the movie's soundtrack on the ""Capote"" Web site. The composer is Mychael Danna, who has scored several movies, including ""Being Julia"" and ""Shattered Glass."" I could not find a soundtrack CD listing for ""Capote"" on Amazon. I e-mailed Danna on his Web site and asked about this. He said a soundtrack is not planned! Amazing! Does anyone have any reason why, besides economics?? I suspect we are missing out on a fine soundtrack CD!"
2,Great actor but bad movie,"The only redeeming quality of this film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman and his portrayal of Truman Capote. Everything else is lacking- especially a good cast and storyline. It barely scratches the surface of events surrounding the killings and its aftermath. It can't hold a candle to the orginal ""In Cold Blood"" starring Robert Blake. Those who read the book will notice all the flaws of the film ""Capote."" one of the worst films of 2006."
3,Film Won't Mean Much for Those Unfamiliar With In Cold Blood,"Having read and loved Truman Capote's masterpiece In Cold Blood, I was eager to see the ""story"" behind the creation of this book. In Capote, what I got was a performance and script so understated it was boring, dull, and slow. There is no action or even a climax to the film. Non-literary, non-intellectual, non-egghead types would be bored to death with the lack of tension and conflict in the film. The film is about four brutal killings, but the murders are never re-enacted. You see a shotgun blast from a window, hear a girl scream as she finds the bodies, see a killer going up the stairs with a rifle, and see a body lying on its side on the bed with blood on the wall, but this is not enough to bring the terrible events to life.However, if you are familiar with Capote and are in awe of In Cold Blood, you will probably enjoy the film."
3,Hoffman,"This movie is emotionally intense at times, but other than that I did not find it unique. Philip Seymore Hoffman's performance is what is worth watching. He is awesome-- his physically transformation and the way he affects Truman Capote's mannerisms is astounding. But the story is dull and the charactors uninteresting. In Cold Blood, the book, would be a better choice. I did like its depiction of Capote and Harper Lee's friendship, because I had know previously that he was Dill in To Kill a Mockingbird, but not that they remained close friends into adulthood."
2,Twerp gets his own movie,"Capote was a disagreeable figure in real life. This film shows the flaws in his character that would grow to mammoth proportions by the end of his life. The problem with this film is that 1) I couldn't understand half of what Hoffman (as Capote) was saying. Hoffman may have his lisping, nasal, girlish speech down pat but that doesn't help the audience. Raising the volume didn't help a bit. The problem was with Capote's poor articulation and low speech intensity. 2) This really isn't very interesting. Story: writer/journalist crosses the line when it comes to ethics and objectivity in order to further his career. What a staggeringly novel concept!! And the story of a murder in Kansas is not international news - it's just a senseless murder in a little town. That Capote lost his objectivity when working on it should bring nothing but a big yawn since it has no historical importance. 3) This movie is dull.Don't waste your time."
2,"An interesting look into the mind of an author, but not a great film.","I'll keep this short as alot of reviewers on Amazon are not going to like me for my opinion.This film was interesting at first with a stunning transformation and performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Capote is brilliantly directed with fantastic visuals of the 1950's. But..... I found the film to be a bit too dragged out and very slow paced. PS Hoffman does keep you interested, as he drags you through the very slow pace of the film and slaps out a couple of slightly amusing jokes. However, Capote is a serious film that deals with an even more serious subject, but seems very dull and lifeless and in some parts very boring.I would have liked to see this film done better, with a bit more pace and character as it is a very interesting subject to take on. Hoffman good, film bad."
3,Hoffman is great...the movie is weak,"Phillip Seymor Hoffman gives the performance of a lifetime. He has the character down. It may not always be 100% accurate, but it is spectacular.However, the movie the dull and slow. It plods along with a snails pace. There is no reason why movies like this should be paced like this. Keeping people's interest is key. Anyone who has seen Ray knows you can keep a story going and not get bored.It's not a bad movie, but it expects you stick around just for Hoffman and that just doesn't cut it."
4,"Sharp, Witty and a Brilliantly per-formation","I went to see this movie not knowing the story of Truman Capote, I found it to be very interesting the character was so original and likable. Of course the acting was brilliant, I've see a lot of Philip Seymour Hoffman movies, as I wondered when he would get the chance to show how good his acting skills is. Some of his other great work would have to be Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. If you haven't seen them trust me their impressive.Truman Capote (Hoffman), during his research for his book In Cold Blood, an account of the murder of a Kansas family, the writer develops a close relationship with Perry Smith, one of the killers.This is a very Dramatic movie if you like these types of films that show you the truth in style Example Schindlers List you will love this."
1,A bad move.,"I do not understand why this move received a lot of good reviews? I watched first ""Infamous' move about T. Capote. It is much greater move than this. It balances out hrrible crime and Truman's life style and personality. I so much like ""Infamous"" that it became my favorite move which I can watch over and over again. The main character in that move is a really great actor. His play moved me comparing with ""Capote' main character, actor really plays poorly . His artificial play was felt throughout the move. It was first and last time I has been watching ""Capote"" and I would not recommend this move to anyone. A poor quality."
1,"Er, huh?","Ok, I know this movie has received tons of kudos, but I myself can't really for the life of me see why. I read ""In Cold Blood"", and have enjoyed all of Truman Capote's works, but this movie literally put me to sleep. I'm a huge fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman, but egads! I felt a need to get up and slap the TV set from having to listen to his indecipherable verbalizations! I could scarcely understand a word he said, frankly! The whole thing was just a plodding, sluggish, boring, lackluster movie for me. I only stuck it out because I'd paid for the rental!"
3,"Great acting,but hit&Miss film","Truman Capote was a very complex Character&I think that Philip Seymour Hoffman nailed the role.he had all the mannerisms&speaking&Manner down pat. the film was kinda patchy in spots,but it centered where it mattered most&that was on Hoffman's performance."
3,"""What's the title of your book?""","Capote starring oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman is an ok film that surrounds a true life story. Truman Capote (Hoffman) is a writer, he is resepected in his field, he wrote the book Breakfast at Tiffany's but for his new book, he decides to write about two men who killed a family in Kansas. His book, In Cold Blood made Capote a legend but it also ended his career as a gifted writer, he felt such tremendous guilt about the way he manipulated one of the killers, Perry Smith. Capote becomes depressed, paranoid and eventually drinks himself to death but none of this is shown in the film. I think the film was good but a bit boring at times. But Hoffman's performance is truly captivating, his performance alone is a reason to watch Capote. Take it or leave it."
3,Interesting Character Study,"Capote is a broken, self-absorbed, and narcissistic individual. From the start, we see that he is drunk on his fame and accomplishments, and that he has lost his sense of perspective. He presides over cocktail conversations much to the delight of his listeners; but as intelligent and charming as is, he is convinced that his universe takes precedence over everything else -- even the lives of others. The inner termoil that results from this delusion is the basis of the film, Capote -- a character study of an ego that crowds out the life of a tormented soul.Hoffman's performance alone is reason enough to watch this movie, but prepare yourself to be pulled down by the weighty subject matter and its deliberate pace."
1,Needless Displays of Violence,"Paleeze--Can't believe the hype over this film. Not sure why it was even made when the the book, ""In Cold Blood"", and the film based on the book tells it all. Displaying the gruesome murders was extremely upsetting along with Truman's glimpse into the casket--UGH--did we need that! Also, who needed to watch the execution??!! I must be on my very own planet as I know several people who saw the film and they never mentioned the graphic violence. The essence of these scenes could have been conveyed in more subtle tones."
1,Must have been funded by Cigarette manufacturers... it is just me or are,more and more remakes from the 1960's being made to promote smoking...
4,"""It's the book I was always meant to write""","Philip Seymour Hoffman is simply an outstanding actor. He portrays such a unique and quirky character - and he does it unbelievably well. Capote is quite an interesting character, himself. Eccentric, humorous and ultimately revolutionary in his craft.The story is engaging, as are the characters involved. The screenplay is exceptionally well-written, creating some very emotionally intensive scenes. Some scenes are humorous, some shocking, some uncomfortable and some utterly heart-wrenching. This was a very entertaining movie, with stellar performances."
2,Umm....,"I have to say I really didn't enjoy this film. It was a dark, depressing film that portrayed the sympathetic relationshiop between Truman Capote and several men who brutally murdered a family. I didn't get it. Was that supposed to be interesting? Well, it wasn't to me. Also,while I admire Philip Seymour Hoffman, I don't think his portrayal of Capote was effective enough to overcome the ick factor of his near romantic relationship with a murderer. I prefer enjoyable films, but hey, thats just me."
4,Biography,"I had no idea about the life story of Truman Capote. He was far more interesting than I'd imagined, and very human on the one hand, and ruthless on the other hand, and his conscience suffered heavily for his profession. Very edifying."
4,Five-Star Performance. Four-Star Film!,"Philip Seymour Hoffman deserved the Oscar and more! His ability, to immerse himself into Capote's character, was nothing short of incredible! Overall I thought the film good, but at the end, it left me feeling as if something was missing. Maybe it was that the storyline failed to tap fully into the depths of Capote's own upbringing as it connected with Perry. Can't quite put a finger on it. I will admit, I have not picked up a copy of his book, ""In Cold Blood"" since the 70's. Perhaps if I had read the book prior to seeing the film, it would have filled in some of those missing pieces. But not enough reason to overlook this film. A must see!"
3,the voice darling the voice......,Capote has an effete sophisticated particular and perculiar charm that was intelligent and caring. All pleasing qualities but I began to get bogged down by the voice because Capote felt too carefully conventional and needed to be enlivened by a certain risque and occational eccentricity to hold appeal and my interest.Besides I enjoyed In Cold Blood far better.
2,"Happy for Mr. Hoffman, but........","As an actor, I have no issues with Mr. Philip Seymour Hoffman. He's due to win for something. Unfortunately, Capote was not one of my favorite 'Hoffman' roles. Also, Hoffman didn't deserve to win over Joaquin Phoenix, whose portrayal of Johnny Cash, made me go out and buy the movie and the CD. This is a real phenomenon because I really don't like country music. Who makes these stupid decisions in Hollywood? Sorry, Mr. Hoffman but Capote is not as good or as memorable as the characterization in Walk the Line. Frankly, the only memorable performance in Capote was that of the convicted criminals."
1,booorrrrinnnggggggggggg,"Phil in Flawless was off the hook funny, and I knew this movie was going to have a ""gay tude"" about it, but man, it was SLOW. yea yea phil got ""into"" the part, but so what. only reason he got an award for this is hollyweird is 90% liberalI found this to be the most annoying and tedious movie that I have had the misfortune of watching in the last TEN years. Never an exciting moment, the main character's strange pitch of voice drove me crazy within 10 seconds of first hearing it. If you like extremely shallow and dull 'documentaries' then by all means buy this film right away! If you appreciate excitement and characters you do not want to do away with, go elsewhere, ANY where else..."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Laughably bad acting. Adam Sandler would have done a better job. Hoffman sounds like he's doing a bad imitation of Sandler's retard voice, or Mr Mackey from South Park. He's talking like he's had half his tongue cut off, and every vocal lilt smacks of laboured premeditation. I haven't heard the actual guy he's playing talk, but I don't need to to know he didn't talk like that."
2,Boring and Predictable,While I expected to be interested..this film turned out to be everything I had expected with no real revelations and a tiring and mocking performance by the oscar winning lead..
3,Overrated acting,"This is a rather boring movie, not just because of the deliberate moody pace, but more because of the dated story and characterization. Huffman delivers a cheesy portrayal of Capote. In my opinion, the best actor for that role would have been Peter Lorre. Overall, this movie is instantly forgetable - a really weak entry among the Oscar selections."
2,Not a good film in my opinion,"Despite the Oscar Nomination and the rave reviews about how close Capote got to the murderer perry smith, i never felt it. There was great distance between the two characters and the affection which according to product reviews was mutual was simply not there for me.This film did not get the oscar and certainly did not deserve to."
1,"Slow, boring, with a lot of questions left in my head!","Like the title says...this movie is very slow moving and the plot is very boring. Then when the end comes along you expect something great, but no, just a bland ending to a bland movie. Perhaps if you like to look at movies on a ""deeper"" level than simple entertainment you might possibly find this movie interesting. The only plus side of this was the fine acting of the character Truman Capote. He kept the annoying voice consistant throughout the film and the consistancy of lacking almost any emotion was done quite well."
3,"Love PSH, but this film left me cold.","PSH is great, but it takes more than a great actor to make a great film. This is not a great film. Slow and plodding, I fell asleep twice trying to watch it. In the end, I was left curiously cold by the whole effort. Oh well."
2,Scanner Solutions,Not a very good reference. Too confusing for a beginner and too weak for a more advanced user. The book is strongly biased toward Paint Shop Pro and the Windows platform. It mentions Photoshop occasionally and has a almost useless chapter for Macintosh users. If you have children and Paint Shop Pro it might be of some interest.
1,Dumpster rejects,"I have ordered many of these from different amazon storesThese are definitely NOT medical grade.They are most likely the manufacturer rejects they got out of the dumpster.Unfinished, Rough, sharp edges.I would Not buy again"
5,This book saved my life.,"This book literally ""saved my life"". I was in an abusive marriage with my husband's threats and violence intensifying. I finally left our family home to find safety. I was scared and confused. I would wake up in the middle of the night in fear and cry out to God, ""Father, what is your Will for me. Please show me Your Way."" A peace would come over me and I would be able to sleep for a few more hours.I was given a copy of ""The Essential Piece"" by a man that I worked with. It was not easy reading but there was life, real life in what was written. I began to see how ""lukewarm"" my walk with the Lord had been. I started to understand the cost of being a disciple (Luke 14:26) and the accompanying joy of giving up everything for Jesus. My life has not been the same. I would highly recommend this book and also Timothy Williams' book called ""Even the Demons Believe."""
2,"Interesting, but it didn't show the GARDENS!","I thought this video would be a nice memento of my recent trip to Cypress Gardens. Unfortunately, almost the entire video (produced in 2009) was about the short-lived ""adventure park"" that was being torn down when I visited the park in June, 2009. The video offers almost no coverage of the still-wonderful gardens, which have always been the heart of the park. The movie does have some great roller coaster shots, but the roller coasters had all been shut down by the time I visited the park.Perhaps there's a Volume 2 that covers the actual gardens, but it wasn't available at Amazon."
4,Take a look at me now!,"Hey there! I'm Sean ""Puffy"" Combs and I read this book and it totally works! Look at me!"
5,THE OTHER SIDE,It is allways usefull to check the other side.In the case of the war in Yugoslavia there is obviously another side of the story that we did never learn. No matter if you agree with the book or not i believe it would be interesting to read it.
3,a mixed bag,"Upon completion of reading this book, I was left with an odd mixture of skepticism and respect for the work. Skepticism in that Parenti often cites questionable sources such as a Geocities-hosted website, unpublished reports and email conversations with observers. I was impressed however with the important questions that Parenti raises: 'How could NATO violate its own charter and act as an aggressor towards a sovereign nation?' and 'Why did the west facilitate the breakup of a sovereign nation?'The questions he raises and some of his commentary on biased media coverage is a welcome voice questioning the status quo. While I don't agree with every idea or theory he puts forth, I do respect his willingness to be a voice of dissent and one calling the international community to responsible military action (inasmuch as that is possible.)"
5,A masterpiece,"Parenti is simply amazing! He uncovers all those ""details"" that were hidden from us, when talking about the Wars in Yugoslavia. He writes brilliantly and his knowledge is profound. Parenti shows us that it was Croatian and Bosnian leadership that started and WANTED war in Yugoslavia. He also demonstrates to us that Milosevic is not as bad as we would think and that, if compared to Tudjman or Izetbegovic, he shouldn't be even considered as a nationalist. And, above all, he remains objective and neutral. After reading it, you will want to do it again and again! Bursting with little known facts, this book is written using simple language and it is dedicated to all social classes. Do not miss this book"
1,A Worthless Bit of Propaganda,"This is truly a work in hypocrisy. Parenti feels the world media has chosen to cover recent conflict in the Balkans from a one-sided pro-US/EU vantage point. To counter this, however, he writes a weak, one-sided anti-US/EU account which seems to use hyperbole and strong adjectives in the place of facts or real reporting. The arguments are shamelessly simplistic and over the top - this book is unreadable if you have any background in the Balkans. Rather than waste money on this, try a book like Tim Judah's Kosovo: War and Revenge, which is a balanced account. Don't trust Perenti to do your thinking for you - he has an agenda and not many facts."
2,A Nod and Bonfire,"The most important American notion, besides freedom, is responsibility. We believe that ALL people should be held accountable for their actions, regardless of circumstance or time. Kosovo was proof that in times of crisis, action MUST be taken, and our collective personality of ""America"" once again gave us the emotion of guilt, and so we assumed responsibility. It was a conscious choice, and absolutely every single choice has a consequence, and this proved no exception. In times of war, people will die. We could only choose who. The choice will always haunt us. But what to do when our conscience lies?As for Michael Parenti, I have much less eloquent words. Those obsessed with guilt often find ways to share their msiery. I want none of his! That he should feel guilt by choosing to save Kosovo's women children over fawning for a tyrant, speaks unto his soul. A man has passed judgement for making a difficult choice. May HIS judgement be swift, whatever history determines that to be..."
1,Self depreciating book!,"Its easy to write a book when you're in the comfort of your home,searching online databases and then coming up with ""facts"" on what happened somewhere where you've never been yourself.Mr.Parenti,if it wasnt for NATO bombings in Kosovo I would not be writting this review,I would probably be listed as missing,buried somewhere in Serbia with thousands of others that werent as lucky as I was.If you can put the facts straight,this book should be titled To Kill a Nation:The Attack on Kosovo by Serbia."
1,Worthless reading,What a waste of time this book is! A worthless reading full of incredulous conspiracy theories.
1,When Psychopaths write history!,"Shame on those who waste their time reading people like Parenti who is nostalgic of Hitler. If you believe in killing innocent people, rape young kids and poison them, cut women's wombs and take out their unborn babies,burn people alive, and plow up their graveyards is human, then read this sick man and please his criminal mind. For it is this perversed ""writer"" that enjoyed sitting down in his house watching these horrors and satisfying his passion for human blood. Mr. Parenti, when you read this review, I hope you hear inner voices in your dark personality that history has cursed you along with your heroes- Hitler and Milosevic.Let your conscience deal with the guilt in your blood.For those of you who want to see a glimpse of the truth on this subject, go and read the book called ""Serbia's secret war"" by Philip J. Cohen."
5,TOY WAS GREAT TEACHING TOY,THE TOY WAS USED IN A PARENTING CLASS AND WAS ENJOYED BY THE CHILDREN IN CLASS.MY ONE COMPLAINT WAS THE COST OF THE SHIPPING WHICH WAS ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE ITEM ITSELF.
5,Many great finishes-simple and explicit!,"As I look for all my faux finishing books, not one of the books could describe lovely finishes any better or any easier. My stucco and blocks have turned out marvelously...just like the book! Now that's what we like!"
5,Great Basic Reference,"Along with the companion book, Decorative Paint Finishes Made Simple, this is one of my core reference books for faux finished paint surfaces. Pictures are useful, instructions clear . . . a must-have for the faux painter's library."
3,not for intermediate or advanced faux finishers,"A very simplified faux finish book, that I would reccomend to anyone just starting out. The book covers the basics in materials, and prep work. I own both recipe for surfaces books and I wished I would have waited for the library to have them."
3,White Rabbits. White beauty,"Neotropic, aka, Riz Maslen, is a fitting name for this type of airy brand of electronica. The word beautiful comes to mind when I hear 'White Rabbits'. Just think the quirky experimentalism of artists like Four Tet, Boards Of Canada, and Manitoba meeting the beautiful swirly soundscapes of Sigur Ros, Mogwai or Godspeed You Black Emperor. Orchestral as it is electronic, mystical as it is ecclectic, sonic instrumentals into alien worlds that are both foreign yet beautiful at the sametime."
3,simple and usefull,making review of this book is a great experience for me looking in to the book we find the nachural way of getting in every thing is wonderfull
2,"Good looks, Poor performance","The Salter 9180 has great looks and works great as a scale, but the body fat analyser on two units failed after a short time of use. Both of them displayed an ""ERR"" message when trying to calculate body fat and water percentage. Amazon was fantastic on exchanging the first unit and then issuing a refund on the second unit - a no hassle experience. That was not the case when I tried to contact Salter's U.S. office for techincal assistance - on hold with voice recording or busy signal for hours. Never did get through."
4,wait and weight and wait,"I purchased this scale to measure weight only. I don't care about the other functions and therefore am not reviewing them. This scale is absolutely consistent. You step on it ten times in succession and you will receive the same reading each time. The other scales I've owned or tried are never consistent.The aesthetics alone almost make it worth the purchase price.The only negative is the delay (4-5 seconds)from the time you tap it with your foot (to turn it on and for it to calibrate)until you can step on the scale.I'd give it a fifth star if not for that. Of all the other scales I've seen, tried and read reviews of, this would be my Only choice."
4,Owned for 2 months - Good Overall - One Problem,"Accurate. The setup is VERY simple, just follow instructions, takes a few minutes. Does BMI pretty well, cant vouch for water content, seems about right though.The problem. Once you turn it on, you have to bend down and push a button on the side (side of top part) to select the user. Would be nice if you could do that with your feet. Minor/major i dont know. just my thoughts."
4,Weighing in on Salter 9180,This is a great product and it's very easy to set up and use. It stores your profile information but not your previous weigh-in sessions (which is thought to be a great thing by some members of the household) Very easy to use and large numbers are easy to see. More attractive than most scales with this set of features.
4,Interesting black comedy,"This film was a wonderful surprise. Very refreshing change from the Hollywood take on werewolf films or from ""B"" movies. ""The Curse"" is more of an artsy indie film with a ""feminist-in-a-fun-way"" sensibility. The lead actors are all new faces and the love story between Amy Laughlin and Mike Dooly is both funny and touching. The filmmakers were very innovative in working around their budgetary constraints in this low-budget film. I also found the commentaries interesting and informative."
1,Garbage,"Save your money. This is a short (82 minute) piece of [...]. The only reason I watched the amount I did is I couldn't believe how bad it was, and not in a funny Plan 9 way either. Bad cinematography, terrible edits, adolescent screenplay...not one good thing about this ."
1,This product does not work,"I have had two of these in my yard for three months and the mole/vole activity is just as high today (within a few feet of the actual device, no less) as it has been prior to wasting my money."
1,Useless,"Gophers are now happier than ever, and they seem to concentrate their activities right around the ""Supersonic Mole and Gopher Chaser"". I installed it more than 2 weeks ago, and I think the gophers liked it so much that they called in their friends. Every day new holes appear, sometimes 2 at a time.Bottom line is, don't waste your money on this."
1,Less than one star. Completely useless.,installed unit exactly as recommended. Little buzz sounnd it makes is extraordinarily feeble. Left installed for two weeks plus in a Western Washington lawn to zero effect. Mole hills came up within a foot of it as if it were not even there. It is now laying in the garage on a bench and I am out the cost and trouble. I have used other units of this type (not of this maker) which were very successful. Major disappointed!
3,Gopher's are still winning !,I bought 6 of these Super Sonic Gopher stakes. I can't really determine if they are working or not. I still have gophers and feel like I am being over run by this elusive enemy.It may be due to the fact that I had so many to begin with. I am not giving up though. I will continue to put fresh batteries in as needed. I find that in order to control a gopher infestation one must be relentless and utilize everything available in the worlds arsenal for ridding gophers.....:)Happy hunting !Mike
3,Molechaser Problem,I received my Molechaser on 7-11-11. Around 8-10-11 it quit working. I contacted the maker of this unit and they in turn sent me a replacement. Other than it quit working it does an excellent job of chasing my moles away. Says the batteries will last 12 months but-----not so. D batteries are expensive but worth the cost if it keeps them away.
2,much smaller than advertised,"I am very disappointed by this dish. Although the dish is very attractive, the advertised size is a substantial overestimate of the actual baking area - as pointed out by an earlier reviewer. The length of the dish's package measured exactly 14 inches, handle tip to handle tip is about 13.5 inches, and the baking length is roughly 10 inches. If you want a 14 inch baker - choose another product!"
2,reluctant current californian,"I bought this baker because I needed a step up in size from my basic 11.5 x 8 in. pyrex baker. While the glaze, heft, and craftsmanship of the Sabatier are very nice it is clearly NOT a 14 in. baker. The box it came in doesn't even measure 14 inches. The actual baking space is 9.5 inches long - a clear step down from my simple pyrex. I was very disappointed with this misrepresentation and have since returned this product. If you are looking for a pretty dish for smaller dishes than a chicken with roasted veggies then this may be for, otherwise look elsewhere."
2,beware the size....,"... this is not a 14"" baker in the sense that measurements are commonly used when talking about cookware. It's inner dimensions are much smaller."
4,Kiyoshi Saito: master of expermentation,"Maybee you have seen my other reviews on Artist/Printmakers. I am not going to fudge about this book, it is small, smaller than a magazine, has few prints in color, most are B+W, but it is a great source for Saito's images. This book does not show the delicate intricacies, in the details that make Saito's work so beautiful. This book can be a hard find,...a very hard find, but if you love printmaking like I do, you will probally go out of your way to get this one."
2,Look it up.,"One's father told one to look up any word he did not know how to spell. One better know how to misspell a word properly to find it in this book so that one can find how to spell it correctly. For if one spells the word too weirdly one might not find it here.Sea, iff wun spels tings werdly, won mite nefer fined it hier."
5,Is blu-ray 1 disc or 3 discs?,"Your release section says 1 disc, but then you list contents of 3 discs. Is the blu-ray 1 or 3 discs? Please fix."
5,Al Jolson - The Jazz Singer,"I really loved this first talkie movie I got at Amazon . Not only was it really good but knowing it was the first talkie, it was historically great. After seeing the "" The Jazz Singer"" I started watching more silent movies. I really enjoy them. The Three-Disc Deluxe Edition of the ""Jass Singer"" was awesome."
1,Direct Theft By Amazon,"Sale of this boxed set constitutes direct theft by Amazon. PLEASE don't be fooled, you will not get the number ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips"".While the description indicates you will get, along with the feature, selections from the lost movie Gold Diggers of 1929, you will NOT get the advertised selection ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips.""When I received this boxed set, eager to play ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips"", I became angry. When you click on the ""icon"" for the song, you get some other performance. And while that's interesting, it's not ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips"".When I called AMAZON to complain about what I thought must be a defective disc, the guy on the phone said he'd hurry to me a replacement disc.Guess what. Same disc, different day.So, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This whole thing is a trap for the unwary.By the way, if you'd like to see ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips"" on your big-screen, you're hosed. For small-screen, try YouTube. It's there."
2,"Historic film, for sure.","And for that reason, it's worth owning. AS a film, though, despite Jolson, who was a superstar in his time, it's dated badly, which combined with an overly melodramatic script, manages to make it almost laughable. EVERYONE chews up the scenery here, and the depricating asides about Jews and Blacks are fairly insulting, not to mention several stereotypes. The most pathetic scene? Jolson, in full blackface, looking as theatrically pained as possible, and, clenching his fits in the air, screams ""The songs of Israel are tearing at my heart!"" The whole thing is completely surreal."
3,poor quality,The quality of the video is poor. It looks like either the original movie was not preserved adeqately or the process of converting it to VHS was inadequate.
3,The Jazz Singer - 1927,"Although I only consider this first (?) attempt at sound only above average, this commemorative three disk edition is a must have for any serious collector. Jolson does put one through the emotions as he performs in this movie but the dialogue is a bit tacky and the script moves a bit slow - as many early movies are."
4,Maybe the greatest semi-silent,"I saw the Danny Thomas version of The Jazz Singer when it came out about 50 years ago; forgot the plot. Never got to see Neil Diamond's in full. Then I saw Al Jolson. I was spellbound, wondering what the outcome was going to be. The blackface picture on the box was a little offensive and can cause a distraction. They could have chosen some other scene instead.Can't wait for the DVD version to come out, with whatever extras might be included. Hope they do pick another cover illustration ."
3,More Than Just A 'Curiosity Piece',"An historic film, billed as ""the first talkie,"" this was a surprise because many of the lines are not verbalized, only when Al Jolson sings or just before or just after his songs. Otherwise, most of it is still a silent film with the words shown on the screen as in the other silent films.This is a powerful story with interesting characters and good songs, to boot. It was different to see Warner Oland as somebody else besides Charlie Chan. He played Jolson's father and I never would have recognized him had I not read the credits. Nor would I have recognized William Demarest.Jolson, however, is the man who dominates the film. Some of this songs wound up being classics, ones played for years and years, such as ""Toot, Toot Toosie"" and ""Mammy.""Faced with a very tough decision on what to do with his life, Jolson's character does the right thing in the end, which was nice to see. Overall, it's entertaining."
4,Solid dilemma,"The Jazz Singer, generally called the first talkie is still mostly silent, except for a few songs and a rather lengthy, for the time, dialogue sequence. The movie is worth the watch just for the historical value and the songs are pretty fun too.But that isn't all. Al Jolson, once called the greatest entertainer ever, stretches his acting ability to the limit here. Warner Oland is excellent as well as the intolerant but devout father. The dilemma faced by Jakie is incredibly heart rending and Jolson shows this well. Faced with choosing between his own ""God"" and his father's God, Jolson portrays a man trapped in a desperate situation. The one scene where Jolson really shines finds him between his mother on one hand and his boss and love interest on the other. The next to last scene is startling and brought tears to my eyes. Watch this movie. You will be doing yourself a favor."
4,Schmaltzy but still touching,The song numbers are heratwarming. The opening when the Cantor dad drags the kid home is poignant. I guess this film was just made in Hollywood even though much of it is set in New York. It is very touching though corny too. The 1920's is a rarely seen decade now as few talking films were made then.
5,Very Informative And Entertaining.,"I'm not that into ""the oldies"" but I really enjoyed the documentary DVD. Very well done. They have so many experts talking about how movies got their voice. All intermingled with old footage. Very informative. I would recomend for all school audio vidio clubs and college film classes."
3,"The first 'talkie"".","Al Jolson was a wonderful singer but he wasn't a particularly good actor. This 1927 classic, the first ""talkie"", is dated and corny, but at the same time, terrific to watch providing you keep in mind it is 72 years old. If you have never seen it, you may be surprised to learn that for the most part, it is a silent movie. But when Jolson sings and talks, it is great."
2,"Great film, bad DVD with no menu",Great and important film. DVD is not great because it does not have a menu/scene selection. This will make it difficult to actually use.
5,The man with a tear in his voice....,"Very good looking blu-ray, considering the age of this film....the audio is also very good for what it is.... The film itself is dated, of course, but it is a very good film, taken in context....very good story overall.... Jolson does a fantastic job playing a Jew torn between his father's desire for him to be a cantor in the synagogue and his own desire to sing in the theater....24 Vitaphone shorts on one disc and a great dawn of sound documentary on another disc plus a cool cartoon....the book is very informative also....good stuff all around....groovy...."
1,WRONG BOOK- ISBN # in Amazon is for two different books- be careful!!,"Amazon's database combines two very different ISBNs for two very different books to come up with the same book. I wanted the 7th edition PreCalculus: graphical, numerical, algebraic ISBN 013227650-X but received Student's Solutions Manual to accompany Precalculus: Functions & Graphs fourth edition ISBN#020169975-3. Both books are by Franklin Demana et al.If you put in either ISBN#, the same book appears on Amazon's website.Be careful about what you order! If you want the text book with the Ferris Wheel on the cover, don't order the paperback! After multiple emails with the seller, I am out 20% for re-stocking, shipping cost of sending it back to him, and the loss of the expedited shipping ($9.95) I paid to get a totally wrong book."
4,"Bubble-bursting, fascinating read","This book has completely burst my bubble as regards the American founding fathers, to the point that I am ashamed to have played John Adams in a school play in the 6th grade. This is not the easiest book to plow through, especially if you check all the footnotes, but it's well worth it"
1,"Massive, Praised, Utterly Unreadable","Somewhere in this huge, awkwardly written, and badly organized doorstop, there is a tremendous story just waiting to get out. If only the author had some sense of drama, pacing, or a writing style that was compelling instead of simply being an annoying novelty.Tedious is a kind description for this very amateurish and pseudo-scholarly attempt at historical revisionism. The author is like one of those annoying phone-in radio talk show participants who are crammed so full of gossipy, half-substantiated trivia and disorganized facts that they have a hard time making any real sense.Overhyped, overrated, overwrought, and overpriced."
5,Useful and eye-opening,"Highly recommended for parents of children of all ages. This is a provocative and helpful book. Parents who aren't yet concerned about how their kids are being brainwashed by the media will be after they read the book; concerned parents will find great and useful tips for dealing with their children after they've been exposed to any number of marketing schemes. The book identifies specific marketing strategies aimed at different age groups from baby to teenager, then gives advice on counteracting these strategies. Parents will want to pass this valuable book on to their friends."
2,Lousy DVD from Disney,"No problems with the film itself, I saw the theatrical release several years ago, and loved it. I refuse to buy the lame excuse for a DVD that Buena Vista has offered. When will the message get through? Serious films need the serious treatment on disc, especially if we are going to be gouged with Disney prices. The absence of anamorphic enhancement on this film is close to criminal in my eyes, and the rest of the shoddy package, right down to the boilerplate on the case, is an insult. Criterion did a Laser Disc of this film, and this DVD needs the Criterion treatment. Tell me I'm having a bad dream!!"
5,"Better, best!","This version is so much a better movie than the dreary 'Talented Mr Ripley', no wonder it was never mentioned! Perfectly constructed tension, beautifully filmed and very well acted - a great movie on all counts."
4,Purple Noon,"In an age of sensational stunts and special effects designed to attract audiences, it is refreshing to see that these are not necessary to intrigue, entertain and to tell a story well.I saw this film many years ago as a young man and left me with an indelible memory, I wanted to see it again to test that memory. I was not disappointed, the acting, the direction, the locations, the cinematography, all impeccable.I wonder if those involved in the disappointing re-make ever saw it. If they did they learnt nothing from it."
2,Great movie but DVD had technical problems,"This movie had some strange problems at the menu level and at the end of the playback. Sometimes there was a dark screen at the beginning, also it was not possible to start the movie using some of the menu links. At the very end playback became jumpy. All those problems are probably an effect of faulty manufacturing, surface of this DVD doesn't look perfect."
5,MIDDAY SUN and just a touch of HEAT.,"DELON's 'heat' that is - what a debut, and what eyes, face and smile! One almost wants him to get away with this one - and maybe he does ... he does have the gift of talking his way out of any situaiton, not so?FAR superior to the remake, this one is sundrenched, and peopled with lovely, boring, pointlessly babbling rich kids .... until our 'hero' is sent to bring this old schoolchum back home ... he likes what he sees, wants to be part of it - and tries his best to be.Can't blame him - the Victim somewhat deserves to be snuffed! It's amazing to see how comfortable Delon is with this role, and how easilyhe slips into 'the life'Beautifully paced movie with just the correct elements of suspense - will he ever get rid of that overweight victim? Or be crushed by the guy?Nice twist at the end too!Oh yes, Romy Schneider [long time amour of Delon] has a bit at the very start of the movie - before her career took of with ""Bocaccio 70""."
3,Entertaining,"Unfortunately the version I received was dubbed, which has a definite impact on this review. I despise dubbed movies, so I know this version affected my review. That being said, this film holds up over time and doesn't feel remotely dated. The cinematography as well as the actors, is positively gorgeous. It's impossible to comment on the acting because all I would be commenting on is the emoting which would be five stars. Other than a vague similarity in storyline, it doesn't really bear a resemblance to The Talented Mr. Ripley. I felt a much greater characterization in The Talented Mr. Ripley; got a greater sense of who they were. Purists will consider The Talented Mr. Ripley an abomination of this film, but I actually enjoyed it more. Any Alain Delon fan will love this film and perhaps a year from now I will try and get the subtitled version, but at this moment...viewing it once was enough."
3,"""Ripley"" was better...","I saw ""Talented Mr Ripley"" first, then read the book, then saw ""Purple Noon."" I think ""Ripley"" was much more faithful to the book, much better-acted and directed. WHat I didn't like about PURPLE NOON is that it picks up right in the middle of the book, with no exposition or development of any of the characters. And the ending was very finite, not open-ended the way ""Ripley's"" was. What DID i like about Purple Noon? It's the most beautiful color and cinematography I think I've ever seen on a screen.... gorgeously photographed."
5,The price is much to low. Should charge more.,"I saw this movie in 1961 at the Carnegie Theater below the Hall. It was perfect and I would love to see again but I am too embarrassed to buy it at such a low price. I was in my very early 20s and I didn't know there were places that beautiful in the world, especially the scenes shot in Taormina. Highly recommended."
5,Smells Great Feels Better,"This scrub was re-gifted to me last christmas. It took me 6 months to use it cause I figured it was cheap and corny. It is the best body scrub I've ever used. It smells delicious. But better than that, it makes my skin feel like a baby's bottom. My mom came to visit, it was in the shower and she used it. She tried to steal it saying its one of the best she's ever used and she's tried all kinds of expensive, organic, specially formulated crap. For [...], get it. I think I may try some of the other scents too."
4,A Wonderful Tool for Citizens,"This guide is a very practical for citizens who want to begin the neighborhood planning process. It provides step by step procedures on how to get started and what to expect. It begins with an introduction to neighbhorhood planning and why it is important. It then goes on to describe a seven step planning process that begins with data collection and ends with implementation. Though somewhat vague, there is information on how to collect and interpret data, how to pinpoint issues, and how to set goals. The descriptions are easy to read and practical for the layman, but the professional planner might find the reading a little to ""thin"". The appendix contains a very useful example of a citizen survey and specifics on how to perform a goal setting exercise. Overall, Jones uses easy to understand everyday language to describe what can be a complex and intimidating process. Every neighborhood group should have a copy in their office!"
1,HATED IT,"I am indeed a Zane fan, I've read every book that she has. This is a major disappointment to all fans. I would assume that the people who read Zane books are FREAKS or undercover ones, as one of them this gets a THUMBS DOWN! The DVD doesn't wake up up any of your senses at all, better off watching HBO or Showtime after dark. My feelings were hurt after watching Sock it to Me. Lastly, who in the hell choose the characters(Not Sexy) and the camera people....cheap very cheap."
1,Don't Let the Name Fool Ya,"This was under my ""recommendations"" on Amazon.com because I've purchased Zane material before. Because it said ""The Sex Chronicles,"" I had the mind set it was a bit of a follow up to her Cinemax series or something of the sort.Boy was I wrong.This looks very low budget and the acting is not spot on at all. I'm a bit surprised it was even produced. That said, in regards to the ""steamier"" scenes, the only thing steamy about it was that they were in the shower.I'm pretty disappointed I must say. Unfortunately."
4,Autumn's Flame,"This was a very informative and enjoyable historic novel taking us back to Brave Knights and Fair Maidens, when true love was more of a novelty than not in a time when marriages were prearranged. It was refreshing to have a Heroine who was both brave and outspoken in a time when women were kept in the shadows, and a Hero who admired those qualities once he learned to know and love her."
4,"Great book, great prize","I loved the book. First one was free, then bought all the rest of the series. The flow of the book was great, it read well and quickly. Money well spend."
4,Great Historical,"I did not give this book five stars simply because it was not my favorite ofMs. Domning's Fitzhenry series. Compared to many writers though, it would be five stars.Her characters are real, the situations are exciting, and the history surrounding the events are interesting.If you like medievil stories, the entire series is worth reading. Be sure to read the series in order or you will lose valuable insight into the characters."
5,excellent,"As one part of a five-part series, this book (as all the others) doesn't disappoint! Set in 12th century England, each book is so well researched, so well written and has such powerful character development, that you won't be able put it down!"
1,What the..?,"These series started out great. There was enough comedy and kicking Kitaro around. However, this dvd is annoying. There is not enough laughs and just the way these girls treat the poor guy is rediculous. The story gets completely idiotic and the plot is completely off. It feels like a total idiot is making up the story for the next episodes or there is not enough budget. I am not happy with this dvd and hope that the rest will get better."
3,Transform? Swordsmaster Motoko's Casual Look,"Love Hina is a good anime. But, this DVD is not so good. For one, the dub voices are all wrong. Urashima sounds like he's holding his nose. Su-chan sounds like she's indonesian when clearly she's an alien. Mutsumi doesn't have that soft voice. And Motoko doesn't scream the same way. Anyway, the first time I saw these certain episodes it was really cool. However, I'm gonna have to say that I am passing on this DVD and waiting for the 4th one to come out. Sara and Seta show up then!"
5,Somebody who watched this DVD can tell me,"Somebody who watched this DVD can tell me if there's closed-captioning on it because i can barely understand what theyere saying without itCand if so, i can't buy it as no CCs in it.Thanx"
3,MISS NEW YORK WHAT CAN U SAY,"This Show was something else, even tho she can be crazy which she admits, i feel bad none of this love game works out for her but she did talk bout tangos mom an i couldnt blame him for leaving her, but i think she let a good man slip threw ha fingers lets hope this new season she finds someone who doesnt like there mom that much i guess lol good luck mama"
5,I Love New York,I Love New York So This Buy Was Everything To Me. I Enjoyed This DVD!!!!!!!!! Most Especially Thee' Special Features!
5,New York at her finest,Ive had this dvd since sometime last year but it is just what I expected. Reasonably priced and most importantly entertaining.
2,Repellent yet compelling,"I was horrified by this strange cast of characters yet I couldn't stop watching like the proverbial auto accident. A young woman with hideous face paint calls herself New York and tries to pick a suitor with her hysterical, disapproving mother's advice. The men are named ""The Entertainer,"" ""Tailor Made"" (a crybaby who rats out the competitors), and ""Buddha""(a manipulative guy who gets into New York's head and controls her.)She herself struggles whether she wants a guy to control her or if she wants to boss around the guy and she vacillates throughout every episode. No actual romantic connection is ever made except a lot of necking and New York's constant need for reassurance, ""Do you have love for New York?"" She actually swears more than a native New Yorker. It is like a freak show and I could not stop watching. Recommended!"
2,"NOT the best ever, just another ""best of...""","I'll get right to the point. This is EXACTLY the same track listings as ""Grand Funk's Greatest Hits"" only the tracks are in a different running order. It also has all the same songs as are included in ""The Capitol Collector's Series"". So if this a third generation re-hash (fourth if you count the now out of print ""Grand Funk Hits""), then how can this possibly be ""The Greatest Grand Funk Album Ever""? If you ""like"" Grand Funk, then there is certainly nothing wrong with this set. That is unless you already own one of the previous CD's that I have mentioned here. Then you might get this in the mail and feel a little ripped-off. But if you are a true fan, check out ""Trunk Of Funk"". That might be more to your liking than this imported re-hash."
4,Very Best of Grand Funk Railroad,Their songs and albums remind me of the day when I could go into a night club and hear bands imitate these great rock classics
5,Another wonderful DVD by Kathy Smith,"I truly enjoy when several DVDs are combined into one and this set is fantastic. I enjoy the Menopause DVD section, which is broken down into 20 minute section as well as the fabulous 30 minute yoga workout help invigorate me to start the day."
4,Kathy Smith - Body Boomers Workout,"i already had most of these, as it is a repeat of her ""menopause"" tape, but good workout for all levels of fitness."
1,Readers Deserve Revenge,This is the worst piece of drivel I have ever read in my life. The author is obviously not well educated. The book is full of grammatical and punctuation errors. I would like to know what publisher would let something this bad go out without being properly edited.
2,Weak on some topics,"The Men-at-arms Series covers ancient and classical China in five books, all by Chris Peers who is very familiar with the subject. This is the third book in this series. The chapters: Chronology -- The Sui dynasty -- The T'ang -- Sui and T'ang armies -- The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms -- The Sung dynasty -- Sung armies -- The Liao -- The Hsi Hsia -- The Kin dynasty -- Military science and technology -- Nine important battles. The text focuses on telling Chinas military history; it is very weak on topics like weapons or battle tactics. The drawings by Michael Perry are ok. The maps are primitive and not very useful. This book is the sequel to ""Imperial Chinese Armies 200BC - 589AD"" (MAA284). The next book in the series is ""Medieval Chinese Armies 1260 - 1520"" (MAA 251)."
1,How do you mess up something this simple?,"I started reloading 4 months ago. My first tumbler media purchase was 10 pounds of Lyman corncob. I wondered why I had to tumble for 4-6 hours to get my cases shiny when other folks reported that it took 2 hours. I continued wondering for 4 months while I used up the Lyman media. Then I bought some corncob media packaged by another company, and knew as soon as I opened the box that something had been horribly wrong with the Lyman. The new media was very consistent in particle size, the particles were larger, and there was no dust. Sure enough, my first batch of brass was like new after two hours of tumbling with the new media, which, by the way, cost half as much as the Lyman."
1,Kolpin Gear Lock and Load System,Used the system on my ATV to attach my Kolpin gun boot 6.0.System looks great but within a day broke apart from the jarring motion of the gun boot.Spoke to Kolpin folks who were great. They are sending a replacement but also said the gun boot is really too large and flimsy to be using with this system .
4,Great for Texas Custom BBQ Sauce,Recieved this as a gift and love it! I can now mix my custom home made Texas BBQ sauce and glaze without the mess. Y'all need to get one for your grill.
3,:),"I love these, I used them to pierce my navel. The only problem I had was that they were VERY sharp and painful if you closed them so use a rubber band to hold them together when piercing <3"
3,smaller than we thought,when I originally ordered this little statue I thought it was larger than it is. It is really cute though
3,Many words for a few ideas.,"The introduction says ""This is a book about the things people say about images"". As a person who buys a lot of instructional books which I hope are insightful and succinct I found this overwritten. Someone liking miles of wordy literary type criticism might find it appealing."
4,Not really a trio album featuring George Wettling,"This is a four star album only because Ralph Sutton deserves no less. If you buy it to hear George Wettling, as I did, forget it. Sutton plays his usual great two-hand stride piano which leaves little room for bass and drums. All you can hear of Wettling is straight four-four brushes--no solos--on about half of the numbers. This was recorded in two sessions in 1950 and 1951. Wettling appears only on the first session and Buzzy Drootin on the second. Jack Lesberg (bass) is on the first session and Bob Casey on the second. Drootin doesn't get to play any more than Wettling and Casey only gets a couple of two bar breaks toward the end of the album."
4,Excellent review of corporate raiding strategies.,This is an excellent book. It almost reads like fiction. The behind the scenes dealings that involved the attempted hostile take over of the Walt Disney Company reveal the inner workings of the corporate raiding frenzy in a way that even the novice can understand.
4,Reivew,"The book arrived in just a couple of days. It arrived in pristine condition, as advertised. Though I haven't had an opportunity to read it yet, I'm familiar with the plot. Thanks you."
3,Book about the Royal Scots Fusilliers,"I thought this book was a complete History of the Royal Scots Fusilliers. I assumed the 1885 in the title was when it started, not when the contents of the book ended. As this was the Regiment my grandfather and his brothers belonged to, I shall enjoy reading it just the same."
5,Metallic gold with shades of green,"The amazon picture does not show that there is gold thread woven in with the green silk, which gives the necklace a truly beautiful sheen and sparkle. There are a lot of different shades of green in this necklace, from olive, to forest, to light, to dark. There are also beautiful variations of stones, pearls, and glass beads, all in different shapes and sizes, some are faceted and some are smooth. The total effect is that of a glittering golden/bronze/greenish hue that goes well with many colors in the wardrobe. Since I'm a cool-toned women I was afraid it would be overly warm-toned and look bad with my skin-coloring, but there's enough different colors going on that it looks great. This necklace is unique and lovely and I will wear it with pride."
5,Excellent reporting,"The Tupelo Years like all the books I have read by Bill Burk are excellent ventures into journalism. From the first word to the last you never lose interest or feel that a story slows down in the middle. Mr Burk is a articulate and superb writer that captures you the moment you enter his world, always keeping accuracy as his main goal."
3,Lid only for large salad spinner,"I bought this as a gift to go along with the small salad spinner that I had purchased. Everything sounded great, such as the berry basket fitting both the small and large salad spinners.It does have a lid for the whole salad spinner for storage but the lid only fits the large salad spinner. It would have been much nicer to have included 2 lids for the salad spinner, one for the larger spinner and one for the smaller spinner. Then the kit would have been fully compatible with both spinners.Overall everything looks fine and as though its made well but since I bought this as a gift I haven't used it. But my recipient will have an extra lid handy for miscellaneous things. :)"
5,Wow!...Haven't read a book like this in a long time.,Unbelievable. I was taken in from the first page. It is lyrical and lovely. Most of the lesbian themed books I have read are all pretty plain and simple. Not alot by way of plotting. But this book was very complex -- but not in a way I ever got lost. I loved the relationships in the historical novel. The romance is wonderful but not sacharrine. The love scenes are among the best I have read -- very erotic. Especially when Byron discovers the opium den (had to read that one to my lover!). I read this book last week and I just can't get it out of my head.
5,Best book I have read this year,"I have read all of Conn's work, and this is by far the best yet! There are too many twists in the plot to go into details, I wouldn't want to ruin it for you, suffice to say you will enjoy both the modern characters in the novel and their historical counterparts in the ""novel within the novel"". As you get to know the characters, it is fascinating to see how the lives parallel, and truly gives you insight into the minds of writers. This will definitely be a must on my Christmas list."
4,Fascinating & Encompassing,"She's done it again. Nicole Conn has weaved a wonderful tale of two parallel stories. Much like a good tapestry of life, Ms Conn intertwines two lives back and forth. It took a couple of chapters to get into the ""rhythmn"" of the genre - but once I started, I could not put the book down.I loved it - made me feel like I was back in Paris with the best of writers and poets and yet, at calm in Oregon trying to sort out one's life.Do yourselves a favour - pick up this book and let your imagination run with Nicole !!!"
5,Outstanding,"Death Cab for Cutie's last independent release leaves little doubt as to why this outfit is now on a major label. Touching explorations of the human heart, ""Title and Registration"" and ""The Sound of Settling"" take the listener and plop them right in front of love's sometimes unwelcome outcomes: disappointment and regret... We've all felt this way, and Death Cab for Cutie expresses these feelings with compassion and understanding. It's why we listen - It's why we care."
5,Masterpiece!!!,"This has to be one of their best CD's to date. Every track on here is perfectly written and produced. Now,that doesn't mean that their other albums are bad. These guys have never put out a bad album in their career. I would rate this at the top of my fave DCFC albums,followed closely by a tie between Photo Album and Plans. Tracks that stand out for me would be...Title & Registration,Tiny Vessels,Passenger Seat,We Looked Like Giants,and Lack of Color...although the other tracks are still great.Definetly recommended if your a new time fan that just recently heard about these guys. Old time fans all ready know about this masterpiece. 8)"
3,Lost in Translation,"With a title like 'Transatlanticism', I thought this was going to be an ideal cross over for a Brit becoming interested in this kind of music. However, there was not much to rave about in my opinion. I thought it was OK but the hype didn't seemed deserved for bland melody and clever-when-you're-stoned lyrics. I've tried to let it grow on me but it's not raw enough or technically accomplished enough to deserve much more play. The emotional side is nothing that that isn't being said elsewhere. That the singer sounds like The Lightning Seeds' Ian Broudy will not be a problem for everyone but there wasn't much kick to this. It needed it. Too earnest and wet for me but I'll keep trying..."
1,this is so bad,"songs 1 thru 5 are somewhat upbeat (with the exception of throwaway #2) but the songs are boring. the rest of this album is so unlistenable it is painful. lyrically and musically, this album is awful."
4,Good Band,"I like this band. But I don't think of them as Emo. They're far from it in fact I just would label them more of alternative. If anyone takes offense to that oh well. I love music and I'm not afraid to state that I listen to a variety of all music. This is far from the emo groups which to me are more of the Fall Out Boys, MXPX, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, etc..... They've been mislabeled. Oh well they're a great band they belong in the music world unlike bands like Coldplay who should be put in the [...] bin and never be played again."
3,Deathcab for Snoozie - whining set to music,"I'm an indie rock fan but I guess I'm just not at all an ""emo"" fan. Every time I hear emo I think of whining set to music. This disc has a few catchy songs (""Title and Registration"", ""The Sound of Settling"" stand out) but the rest of it is just so slow as to put me into a coma. If that's the desired effect then OK, but just not for me. I don't mind slow songs and think most good discs have a mix of uptempo and downtempo songs but the downtempo is just too heavy here. It doesn't suck by any means, just not my sort of stuff. The lyrics are good, but it doesn't overcome the overall mood. I worry about this generation if this sort of music represents their overall mood - things aren't that bad - wait til you get older and you'll see. Go listen to punk rock or something..."
2,A bit dissapointing,"I love death cab. thier album plans ""awesome"" their other albums, ""sweet"" but this one lacks a certian something that causes it to lose much of the flare so common on death cab cds. their beats are more rock, less of that free spirited tune that made you want to bounce your head to the rythm. if you like death cab go ahead buy it. if your into that whole rock-hardrock scene, go ahead. but it left me with a deep sorrow in the pit of my stomach aching to once again know the death cab that had become dead to me."
4,new to death cab,"anyone who doesn't belt out ""the sound of settling"" along with ben has issues! this cd is breathtaking. check it out."
5,Death of an Interior Decorator,"Lovely CD, but there's an interesting detail: for those who aren't aware, track #9, ""Death of an Interior Decorator"" is inspired by -- and is also a faithful retelling of- Woody Allen's splendid first dramatic film: INTERIORS (1978).Both music and film are MUST HAVES."
3,meh,It's okay. A friend of mine gave me a mix one time that had Title and Registration on it. I bought it because thats one of my favorite songs and I was hoping that all the songs on the album would be that good. Theres a couple other good ones on there but I am not a hardcore Death Cab fan either so I'm sure all you hardcore Death Cab fans will scoff at me for not falling head over heals for Transatlanticism. Its an okay album but not one of my favorites.
5,Wow.,"I'm fairly new to Death Cab for Cutie. My first exposure to them was Plans, which I love. Saw them live with OK Go last year and really enjoyed it. I got this disc and went into it expecting to think ""okay, it's pretty good"" because Plans is so familiar and comfortable. However, I listened to it for the first time today and it's phenomenal.Really.I was drawn in right from the start with ""The New Year"", and I'm not going to rate each song, but the entire disc held my attention effortlessly, all the way through to the end. Right now, I like it as much as Plans. Once I become more familiar with it, I'll like it even more."
5,these songs are so wonderful,"Passenger Seat and Lightness are my favorite songs. If you have to buy one album this year buy this one. It is a great album. This is not shouting junk like nu-metal. This music is fun and it is easy going so you can listen when you are relaxing. it is good with lyrics that are thoughtful. I dont know but I was thinking this might be the best album I have heard all year besides the Babel soundtrack. I would really like to see this band in concert. I think this style of music can be enjoyed by many people whether they like folk, alternative or blues. This album may not grab you right off the bat but I myself find the more I listen to it the more I love it!"
5,One of the few complete albums out there,"You can sum this album up in one word. COMPLETE. I think this album is incredible because it is possible for you to listen to individual songs and still get the idea because the songs are written so well. This is fascinating because the entire album is so perfect as a whole, that is seems strange to ever listen to an individual song. Ben Gibbard is one of my favorite song writers, and he proves to be even stronger with this album. Check out All Time Quarterback to hear more from Gibbard, as well as the Postal Service. You won't be disappointed with anything he has a part of."
3,death knell,"deathcab was my first favorite band. Songs Like ""405"" and ""Coney Island"" were my first step beyond emo, the insight into what was coming, but like all pedastaled heroes, and like all stepping stones, they have reached their prime and have begun to sink below the wake. Its not that this album was bad, but the sound is dated, and because they are not moving ahead, they will fall by the wayside. Luckily a talent like Ben Gibbard has a somewhat forward thinking band to help him pick up where deathcab left off.They played at this years Siren Festival at Coney Island.. and regardless of their current album and my current opinion of the band, I'm sad I missed it."
4,yeah,"i love death cab but these aren't their best songs. i'd recommend older albums above this. that said, i still really like this album - 'we looked like giants' and 'the new year' are the best songs on it in my opinion."
3,"disappointing, very disappointing","now, many of you will want to criticize me for writing this, but i was expecting this to be a rock Postal Service. I was wrong, it is too sour of a CD. I was very disappointed. The first song was good but that's about it. if you like postal service, stick with that okay."
2,"I DON""T GET IT........ DO YOU...........","I bought this Cd after listening to all of these reveiws on this forum. You guys owe me $10.00.First this CD is nothing new or great. It is very well produced and the lyrics are OK (if your a teenager). I saw them on Carson Daly late at night and they seemed to play Ok live, but then I noticed their fan base and then it struct me. All of these reviews have to be from MTV teen-boppers. This Cd is not that great. I asked my cousin about them and he said that they do have a cult following but come on people their are so many better Indie CD's out.PLEASE........... Open your minds to better music. Modest Mouse, Appleseed Cast,Sonic Youth, Radiohead,Built to Spill, ECT...."
1,A limp-wristed trembling excuse of a band,This album had been much hyped and I am very sorry that I bought into that crap. This wuss-rock crap is jaded and boring and this is compounded by the overall sense of ennui on this trite number. The lyrics make one cringe and the sugar-coated forelorn bull could be disney sponsered. For fans of Maroon5 and the ilk only.
1,bad,I don't understand why everyone is saying that Titles and Registration is such a great song. It's not. Neither is the title track.
1,Sucks,"i have never been a fan of this band. they have no catchy songs AT ALL. they really do blow as a band that is ""a not so popular band"". thats my opinion so take it or leave it."
5,I loved it.,"I'm not a huge fan of emo, I'm more into punk rock (Alkaline Trio, Misfits, Suicide Machines, etc). I really liked this CD. I heard this band mentioned on The OC and I decided to check them out.Basically, this CD is telling a little mini story, and I love it. The lyrics are good, too."
3,Decent,"This album is OK, and it has some strong tracks -- ""We Looked Like Giants"" is a high point. What it is doing in the ""Shoegazing"" category, though, I have no idea. That tag really doesn't fit for this album."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a big fan of Death Cab, and have even seen them perform live in my home of Seattle, but this album isn't what I was expecting. Simply put, it's boring! Sounds like vanilla emo that I wouldn't even really call indie rock, and not characteristic of the other stuff I've heard them do. If you like ""Where Soul Meets Body"" and similar songs, look at other albums!"
4,Great,"I thought that Transatlanticism by Death Cab for Cutie is their best one yet. If you love The Postal Service you will definatly like Death Cab for Cutie. I really liked the songs, The Sound of Settling and Lack of Color. I loved the lyrics and basically everything about this CD. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
2,not their best.....,"I personally think this CD is ok...their worst but its alright. Title and registration, the new year and we looked like giants are good songs but the rest kinda suck..If you are looking for a good CD go with Forbidden Love or We have the facts and are voting yes..."
5,Amazing!!!,"I was originally skeptical of a Death Cab release so soon after the Postal Service album. However, I just recieved Transatlanticism in the mail and I have listenened to it straight through three times. It truly is a great record melodically, harmonically, and lyrically. I definitely recommend it, especiallly to old Death Cab fans."
3,"Eh, you'll probably hate this review","I think this is Death Cab's worst album. I really like this band, but the direction they're going into on this album is a turn for the worst. Some of the songs are great, though. Specifically Death Of An Interior Decorator and A Lack Of Color (which totally reminds me of Elliott Smith with Ben singing). Some of these songs just sound like commercial rock. I'd rather listen to We Have The Facts or the Photo Album, this album is pretty mediocre."
3,Great music for mellow music lovers,"This is my first DCFC album and I was expecting something different. At first I didn't like it because I felt that the selection of songs was not very dynamic. It has become part of my bathtub collection with my jazz and pink floyd CDs. However, the more I listen, the more I appreciate the quality of the music. The lyrics are great and I expecially like the imaginitive percussion action of the songs. Even though I felt too many of the songs were slow and dreamy, each individual song was very intense and well done."
3,three stars,"I think this album is good, but I can't say great. It has some pretty good songs (tiny vessels, transatlanticism, passenger seat and title and registration). I have had the cd for about a week now and I'm already getting bored. I can still listen to it because it is mellow and catchy, but it doesn't move me the way I want it to.Although, I'm not familiar with the music of Death Cab For Cutie, I had high hopes that the cd would be really great because I fell in love with Ben Gibbard's work with the Postal Service. Now ""Give up"" by the Postal Service is an incredible cd. Every song on that album is so perfect. I have never been able to listen to every track on a cd, but it is so easy with that album."
5,Ultra good,"This is quite possible my favorite CD of all time. It's so mellow and smooth...everything just flows PERFECTLY. The first song starts off nice and, well, comfortable. Then, the rest of the songs just slide on in gracefully with ease. Before you know, you'll be listening to last song on the CD, wanting more. Transatlanticism is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. I notice that a lot of DCFC's lyrics contaim imagery, which makes you think and visualize what's going on as the lyrics progress. Incredible CD, buy it immediately."
5,All I can say is... WOW!,"I bought this before a trip and took it along - and it hasn't been off my CD player ever since. I'd never heard of DCfC, and only bought the album because I'd heard good things about the Postal Service and picked up Transatlanticism to get the free shipping. It's the best album I've heard in quite some time. My favorites are the title cut, Passenger Seat, Title and Registration and ""The New Year,"" which sets the table so perfectly for the songs to come. Whoever wrote that this is a headphone album was dead-on accurate - it sounds great, and the lyrics are super-clever. Don't be turned off by the weird name - this is a fantastic album!"
3,meh,Pure magic my a%!. This CD like the other Death Cab has a couple fantastic songs but it doesn't make the album 5 stars. Get the singles from the apple store and you're set. Don't waste your money on the full album unless it's 50% off.
1,Bad Book,This book has an error in every chapter I worked through it but I would not recommend it to any one and it has few lessons to build your skill.
3,Earth II,Great movie from my youth. It reminded me when I will home with my parents of the future. I am looking forward to more of the same.
2,Great direction but the story drags,"This would have been a great love story if it hadn't been so serious. I could hardly wait for the next appearance of the excessively courteous private dick because he was such a relief from the one-note monotony of the Fiennes-Moore love affair. And somebody's gotta explain to me the husband's bewildering actions and motivations throughout the film. It's a shame the film wasn't better because the premise of the film is intriguing and I thought Jordan's direction was top-notch, particularly with his handling of flashbacks and alternate points-of-view."
2,There's something is extremely awful here,"Julianne Moore plays Sarah Miles! I never liked her and now I really hate her. She played with one of my favorite actor and her acting was just bad. She didn't understand that kind of emotion completely and she tried to cheat audience, and herself, maybe. These Americans...oh......she even didn't know how to walk and sit down. These girls are really interesting...like Uma Thurman, she was afraid of him, instead of being attracted to him. They didn't have something to help them to face some people."
5,Obsessive obsession,"To love that deeply that you constantly obsess about every aspect of your lover's life is maddening, literally. This couple appears to have a bond way beyond this earth. The heat generated by them almost melts the screen. This is a wonderful torrid love story."
2,Boring romance with a twist ending.,Ralph Fiennes once again suffers in doomed passion - as he didin THE ENGLISH PATIENT. This time he's thrown over for a reason thatmight have been a shocker in the fifties but comes as an unconvincing spiritual conviction at the turn of the milennium. The Cinematography was Oscar nominated as was Julianne Moore's leading performance - neither deserved in my estimation. The film is rather leaden and tacky looking - one wonders why anyone thought it would be interesting to today's audiences. The one overlooked gem is Stephen Rea's supporting performance - he does a wonderful job making a bore actually appealing.
3,Pretty Good but Missing Something,I Finally got to see this Film.I Dug it in Spots but overall something was missing from making it as Important as The English patient.Julianne Moore was solid.She Looked alot like Madonna from Evita in this Film.The Pacing was alright but their's Drama that doesn't Quite Come out fully.it's a Pretty Good Film but I Have this Film Before but with a Different Plot.The Overall Acting was Good but the Chemistry was Lacking in Spots.
2,Good for not great,I liked it but it's probably not one that I'll view more than once - a bit long at some parts and not the best acting on their part either!
3,"Dull movie, but fine direction and scenery is worth it.","This WAS a big disappointment for me. I would have expected a much more engaging, more dramatic movie. It's basically dull (...). Basically, I don't know why critics loved it so much. The only thing I liked was seeing Julianne Moore's bosom many times, plus because of the realistic look and feel of the movie.I would've expected a dramatic movie with a big climatic punch and a tear-jerking ending, and that would have made it so much better. Moore got an Oscar nomination for ""Best Actress"" in this sentimental drama, because she was the only actor in the movie that made it worth seeing. But Jordan also gets credit for the beautiful cinematography and the feel of being in the '40s of England.Rated R for sexuality/nudity, mild language and violence."
1,I can't believe I sat through the whole thing.,The movie starts off with a good concept. Ralph Fiennes in a WWII love story. This should have been a good movie. It was neither a love story nor a good movie. The plot was hard to follow. It was a movie about nothing. And if it's a movie about God then what's with the sex? The sex was one step below porno! Even though the actors were wonderful and the costumes and music beautful that can't save this poor example of a movie.
4,"end of affair ""dvd""","Very good movie, enjoyed it very much! Julianne Moore gave a really good performance.the actors did a very good job in their rolls,and liked the idea of the plot all the way through. ""The story"""
3,sad and touching,I thought the movie was very good even thow some of it was a bit sappy but it was a touching hart felt movie. But this is a chick flick guys will hate it.
3,Affairs of the heart.,"The End of the Affair starring Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore is an interesting love story but falls short of brilliance. Fiennes and Moore pull off great performances but I just couldn't fully enjoy this film, very slow and confusing. There are a lot of sex scenes so this movie isn't suitable for young children. The ending makes this film a disappointment but there is a hidden meaning to the story so pay close attention. Just a mixed bag for me."
2,"Mediocre movie, terrible adaptation","As a standalone piece of art, the 1999 version of The End of the Affair is passable, though forgettable. Julianne Moore and Stephen Rea are very good. However, Ralph Fines is strangely wooden throughout. As an adaptation of one of Graham Greene's finest novels (and one of his ""Catholic"" novels), this movie largely misses the point. Greene was able to cram far more into his 150 page novel (virtually a novella) than got conveyed by this star studded movie."
1,A Woeful Affair,"There is a (hopefully) intended irony at the beginning of the film when Bendrix takes Sarah to the cinema to see a film version of his book and apologises for the fact that it is nothing like what he has written. This screenplay is so far from the original novel that Neil Jordan should be shamefaced in even admitting it is based on it. The only saving grace of the film is Julianne MOore who is excellent, but in every other respect and for the real story and depth behind the betrayal felt by Bendrix then the book must be the only choice."
1,Not if You Really Love Graham Greene ....,"I love Graham Greene, and, since college, have probably read End Of The Affair a dozen times. I looked forward to this film and was impressed by the cast chosen to perform in this film. What a dud!!! I nearly went to sleep ..... Fiennes appeared ill the whole time and everyone else seemed like they couldn't wait to just go home. Terrrrribly dull."
2,So syrupy sweet I almost got a toothache,"I love romance but this film is too sappy by half. Fiennes and Moore's performances completely turned me off and this had to be the most transparent plot I've ever seen. While I usually love corny or romantic stories to distraction, this whole production turned me off. Maybe I'll check out the original version to see if I'd like that one better."
3,Chilly and uninvolving,"In post-WWII London, government functionary Henry (Stephen Rea) asks an old acquaintance, novelist Maurice (Ralph Fiennes), to discover who his wife, Sarah (Julianne Moore), is having an affair with, unaware that Maurice himself is haunted by the manner in which Sarah abruptly broke off their own affair years earlier. The resulting film is well-acted and beautiful to look at, but chilly and uninvolving. Sarah's reason for ending her affair with Maurice is a deep flaw in this film: it requires a degree of idealism and religious commitment that had not been evident in the character prior to that point."
4,Romantically intriguing,"A highly recommendable romantic drama, The End of the Affair proved to be an indulging and intriguing film for audiences worldwide. It may not have got the Oscar success that Neil Jordan was hoping for, but it was a competitive year and The End of the Affair certainly got mentioned in other ceremonies (the Oscar's did give it 2 nominations, which is less than it deserves), which is refreshing. Anyway, on about the film. It has stunning performances, Ralph Fiennes is at his best, waltzing through jealousy with ultimate passion. Most notable though is the brilliant Julianne Moore, who captures Sarah's romantically unhappy side with grace. The script does have flaws - it gives no real explanation of why these 2 people would want to fall in love, but the literature and meaning have lots of quality to them. Nice costumes and beautiful cinematography added, and you have a very moving story that includes almost every human emotion possible."
5,Another Superb Anthology,"For some time now, Coleman Jennings has edited a number of superb books anthologizing plays for children. (His ""mature themes"" book is well worth a look.) And here he has done it again. 15 diverse, compelling, challenging, accessible works that are all exciting in production. Some established playwrights are present (Max Bush, Y York) along with some folks who were new to me.There's an Acykbourne! Bush's Ezigbo is a bit tiresome. My favorite: Bless Cricket, Crest Toothpaste, and Tommy Tune."
1,Disappointed with Quality,"Like the reviewer from Sunnyvale, my Sabatier oblong baker has cracked. I used it once in a 350 degree oven (going into the oven from room temperature, no large stress for a ceramic baker); the baker emerged intact but with a deep diagonal crack across the center and small cracks spiderwebbing throughout the glaze. It is lovely, but absurdly fragile. I also purchased the covered casserole, but am now afraid to use it for anything other than serving. Stick with Le Creuset or Apilco, much more durable and a better investment for the money."
1,Disappointed!!,"I bought two of these, one somewhat smaller--and a perfect size, and this one. They were beautiful and a joy, but they have both cracked. One when I opened the oven door while baking stuffed shells, (cracked diagonally across one corner) and the other when basting a chicken I was roasting with hot broth, (cracked smack in half). At neither time were they subject to quick temperature changes, temperatures above 350 degrees, knocks, heavy weight, etc. A waste of money! I also bought the covered, round baker and have used it many times with no problems. perhaps it's a problem with the square shape."
5,Great for Beginners!!!,"Flash 5.0 GA&I is a great book from James Mohler, a leading multimedia specialist. The book covers enough detail for more advanced flash animators but is easy to read and understand for beginners. The book covers everything from the layout of Flash to integrating it with your website. Mr. Mohler not only shows you how Flash works, but also the intricacies of digital graphics. I think this last point is very important because it helps beginners grasp some of the concepts of digital graphics, which they can take with them when they learn other digital multimedia. This is an all-around great book for people interested in learning Macromedia Flash and digital graphics."
3,not quite as good as one of the other books,"This is a good and useful book, but it could be better.Each function is presented first with explanatory prose, then with step-by-step instructions. The explanatory prose doesn't make any sense until after going through the step-by-step instructions.After a few chapters, I decided that ""Flash 5 Hands-on Training"" (0201731347) was easier to understand, so I switched books.Neither book, however, gives clear instructions on how to create navigation buttons. I had to spend hours of trial and error.Nor does either book explain how to make input boxes and provide feedback for an educational program. I am having to purchase a few more Flash 5 manuals and hope that at least one of those manuals will help me."
2,Why all the positive reviews?,"I got the book yesterday. I'm only about 130 pages into it so far, but the examples are poorly organized and lack sufficient step by step instruction to guide a novice through the materials. In spite of this, the author was able to fill over six hundred pages with paragraph after paragraph of overly wordy descriptions.Mohler makes too many assumptions about what students will be able to do and leaves them find out information on their own in the help files.I cannot recommend the book. Get Macromedia's courseware instead. Less fluff. Tastes great."
5,Excellent Book backed by superb email support,"This is by far the best coverage of Flash 5.0 ActionScript I have found. The author's clear prose and liberal use of examples included on the companion cd rom have allowed me to quickly learn the ins and outs of Flash web animation and programming. He also provides outstanding email support, not only answering my question quickly, but also attaching an example illustrating the solution described in his return email.Flash Graphics, Animation & Interactivity is an excellent investment for first time Flash users as well as experienced Flash programmers upgrading from an earlier version."
4,This book is a workhorse,"Jim Mohler is a professor,who clearly knows how to teach. He moves seamlessly between explaining Flash 5 concepts to precise tutorials. Few books describe the ""how to"" of Flash as clearly as this one. This book's a serious resource and I recommend it highly."
3,Didn't like the sequel as much...,"I bought this book because the first edition was such a cut above the existing titles (then). I was very disappointed in v.2 because in it Mohler drones on about periferal things that I was less interested in. It seemed to me like someone told him that the book needed to be bigger than the last one, so he sought ways to fill pages any way he could.On a positive note... Mohler offers insight into a variety of media that you don't get with some other Flash books."
2,"different cover, same contents","If you have already bought a copy for Flash 4.0, don't ever pick up this book. What you'll get is what you already have gotten. Try an Actionscripting book instead."
3,A good book for animation,It is a good book for anybody looking for getting a good hold on animation which is explained meticulously
1,Tissue paper,If you want some tissue to wipe you nose with then by all means order this. If you are looking for a hall runner as we were it is way to lite weight and thin to do the job. You can put it in the washing machine and wash it as we did hoping it would stiffen up a bit to make it useful but it is simply made out of thin and cheap material to be of any use. Wasted my money!
1,Way Too Loose for Stairs,"I bought this, after having been very pleased with a similar product purchased through Sky Mall. I am very disappointed in the way it does NOT cling to to carpeted stairs. The pile on the carpet is relatively even, and the runner wrinkles, bunches up, gaps, and is generally very unattractive and sloppy looking. I would not recommend this for stairs, even with a minimal amount of traffic."
2,its okay,"This product is just kinda okay. It does the job, but it doesnt have the ""wow"" factor. It does clean up easily, but it also traps dirt, making it get dirty easier too. It sticks to carpet, but because it is a soft material it moves easily. My pets are always piling corners of the rug or even moving it in the middle so it becomes a mess on the stairs. It is probably best to use it occasionally for protecting carpet when you know it will get dirty, then clean it immediately, instead of leaving it on regularly."
1,Out dated and horribly opinionated,This book is outdated and does not really have factual information in it. I would list it as a waste of time and effort.
1,I don't know . . .,I am a short man with a lot of political ideas. I know that this world is a bad place and that the poor people need to have food and shoes. But I don't know about this Reich person. He is a short man to and he don't like the rich. Like me. But he is angry and he has a bad attitude. He reminds me of an uncle I have who gets made a lot and shakes his fist. We call him uncle mean. This Reich person should calm down and should consider steroids. I take steroids and they make things better.
3,Not Impressed,"Sam Bush is one of my favorite mandolin players and he plays well on the cd. This book only has 9 songs in it and on the cd Sam tells you that they're awesome songs and then he plays them. He rarely tells you anything interesting about technique or how he formed his chord progressions. It's just here's the notes, here's what it sounds like, your turn. I'm sure I'll look at this book a few times, when I actually want to learn one of these songs, but they're so many helpful ways to learn the mandolin without spending 20 bucks. I would sell this book for 10 dollars and I've only owned it for a few hours.Don't bother. Just Practice."
4,Solid Debut,"This is a solid collection of Mid-West indie-rock.Fans of Guided By Voices should at least be able to appreciate this even if you're not enamored with it.Fans of this should take a listen to ""Under the Bushes, Under the Stars"" by Guided By Voices."
2,About as interesting as watching paint peel,"This was the set text for a post-grad qual methods course I did. It gives a good coverage of the basics but it is horrible to read, boring and dull. Get Patton's book instead, more depth of coverage and actually enjoyable to read. My copies of Patton and Miles and Huberman are dog-earred with use after finishing my thesis and I am wishing I had bought my own copy of Rubin & Rubin as well as the Bilham book but this one I have never picked up since I finished the course."
2,Could have been better,"From the perspective of a student, this book is incredibly boring. Sure, it covers the basics of qualitative research, but that is only good if you can actually force yourself to continue reading. Many of the students in my class did not understand some of the concepts in the book because they weren't explained well, so when I became the T. A. for the class that utilized this text book, I thought writing out vocabulary words and definitions would be helpful for the students. This small thing made a world of a difference! My problem with this book is that it presents many concepts that are difficult to completely grasp for those who are new to qualitative research, but it does not come with a glossary! How are the authors going to make it a point to highlight certain important words and not define them?! Many of these words are hardly explained in the text and not easily found online (unless you trust wikipedia) so a glossary would have helped."
4,Very Helpful,I used this as a reference during a Masters class. It was very useful when it came time to design my research project.
1,Missing pages!,"After highlighting in the book, thus cannot return, I noticed that the book is missing pages 99 through 130! Of course this is also the whole section on Informed Consent. Needless to say... Im not happy with this. Order with caution."
4,Timken hub assembly,"This product was new in box, shipped as described in a timely manner. This is the second one I've bought due to a design flaw in the unit. But is you have a dodge ram 1500 what else are you gonna do?"
3,Good until it ripped,I bought it for my ex-girlfriend who loves tigger. It was good until it ripped on the pooh bear side :( after a month or so.
3,Hard to swallow,I'm sorry but these capsules are pretty big and quite hard to swallow. Once of them got stuck in my throat...
3,Could have done more on applications,"Hawking, as always, gives a nice, clear, and readable historical perspective with good stories and illustrative proofs. The book would have been enhanced with more attention to: 1) applications in medicine, economics, science and engineering; and 2) a move into numerical or computational methods, now so important in modern research and practice. But perhaps, that will be yet another book in itself."
2,"Need an editor, couldn't agree more","I really want to give this book at least 4 stars as I love the idea of encapsulating those great mathematical breakthroughs in one book and giving each a proper account instead of over simplistic summaries like many other math readings do.HOWEVER, the errors contained in this book is intolerable. It doesn't make sense anymore to give those mathematical details as you can hardly follow them due to the errors.For example, on page 5 it prints:If (2^n - 1) is a prime number then 2^(n-1)*(2^(n-1)-1) is a perfect number and that even perfect numbers must have this form.it obveriously should be 2^(n-1)*(2^n - 1) instead of what has been printed. As other readers have suggested, you would expect more similar errors along the way.Don't buy this book and wait for the 2nd edition if the publisher ever want to make an effort to make this book readable. I'm so very disappointed."
3,Needs an editor,"This book contains surprisingly many grammatical and spelling errors, as well as errors in the equations. If these occurred only in the editor's prologue to each paper, it might be overlooked. But the errors also pervade the papers themselves. These errors are extremely distracting, and often obfuscating."
5,Recommended as a pick for college-level collections strong in mathematics.,"Math enables human society to function - but that areas of math make modern wonders possible, and what problem made each theory's first inventor become involved in a puzzle? While GOD CREATED THE INTEGERS: THE MATHEMATICAL BREAKTHROUGHS THAT CHANGED HISTORY is a follow-up to ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS, it stands well alone as a history of thirty-one landmark cases of mathematical problem-solving, from geometry to calculus. Also included are biographies of each mathematician, the full proof of work reproduced from the original publication, and newly translated results; three of which appear in English for the first time. Recommended as a pick for college-level collections strong in mathematics.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,"Special, but Missing Some","I've only had this book a month and inasmuch as it's encyclopedic in what it does cover, I cannot write anything at all comprehensive. I haven't read my entire Britannica either. I can only be very impressed with the book's selections and its thoroughness in presenting some very special mathematicians, both their lives and their ideas. There's not much attempt to balance the presentations. The chapter on Boole is long, the chapter on Riemann is short.I wonder, however, how Hawking could omit Galois, the youngster who invented modern algebra, and Euler, the most prolific of analysts, both of whose developments had great influence on modern physics.The book would benefit with an index.Should you put it on your reference shelf? Yes."
3,Definitelly a great book but it serious editorial issues,"I will be brief:*** I miss a chapter on Euler. Wasn't he a great mathematician?*** I need a magnifying glass to go with the book. The footnotes are very, very small*** While I understand the editors that they did not want to bring the translated text up to today's standard I believe that a footnote or two to define the terms would have helped. Especially with the Riemann's seminal paper on Geometry"
3,Mathematical breaktroughs according to Hawking,This book is really not for the layman.I did find the biographical part of each mathematician quite informative(I did not know most of it)On the other hand the selection of the important contributions was largely for thespecialists.It certainly would be very useful as a reference.
3,Errors are distraction,"This is a awesome compendium of the original proofs from history's greatest mathematical minds. My only lament is the amount of errors in the text. In addition, some of the sentences seems to be abruptly truncated making it difficult to comprehend the proofs. Unfortunately, I cannot find any errata for this book on the publisher's site. For now, I keep jumping to wikipedia to understand the correct proof!"
3,Awkward layout,"It's not a straight through linear read, but more of a pick the stuff that interests you and read it. The paperback version of the book is very difficult to handle due to the size, also the page formatting tries to use every ounce of space with the smallest of fonts. Not as good as I thought it would be."
4,"ok, purchased the wrong size","I bought this for my cat's booda dome but they are a bit small. I suspect there is another larger size available. In the mean time, these are useable and will work in the filter area."
2,Not worth it with Booda Dome,These didn't fit very well in the Booda Dome. I could use a trash bag and have better results. Skip these and get the No Track Litter Mat instead.
4,Whew!,"Since getting the Booda Dome litterboxes and using the filters, I have noticed that the smell of catbox dust, stool and urine has been cut done quite a bit."
1,They don't stay in,I'm not sure if it's a fault on the filter or the litter box but the filters do not stay in the hood.
1,Not as good as I wish,"The litter box still smells like poop to me, and so does my room that I have it in. Don't see a difference with and without this filter."
4,booda filters,"I buy these things all the time for my two booda boxes. They just don't last long enough. But, I guess with many cats I shouldn't expect that. Otherwise, they are great."
3,So-so,Not sure these really help with odor control but whatever. I'm willing to try it to see if if makes a difference.
3,Wrong size,I have a larger Booda Dome and these filters are too small. I did not see other choices. The price and quality were good. But so inexpensive that not worth the postage to return.
4,Great Filter your Booda Litter box,"Since the Booda Litter box is shaped so different, no other filter can be used. But, Lucky owners of the Booda will be happy to know that this product works and if your looking into purchasing a Booda, do so without regreat, it works well for one cat or 20!!! I have 10 adult cats and 4 kittens and anyone who visits my home have yet complained of any smells from the pantry where the box is placed for my babies. This an the box gets a 10 thumbs up from my family."
1,Worthless Things,"I tried these, but the dome doesn't keep the filter in place so it's falling down into the litter! Grrrrrrr.I have put a dab of duct tape up there to hold the thing in place, and just rinse it, soak it with vinegar and put it out in the sun with the Booda and that's all that is needed each time I change the litter."
4,"A solid tea pot for one, but not without some flaws","This teapot is a decent the price. The teapot is about big enough for one nicely sized cup of tea, and the accompanying tea cup is about 10 ounces, and retains heat very well. It doesn't take up too much counter space, and looks pretty nice on display. The clean, white porcelain matches almost anything remarkably well.The only true complaints I have about this tea pot is the lack of an infusion basket or strainer on the spout (and the opening being at the top of the pot being too small to get a separate basket or tea ball), and the cusp tends to catch loose leaf tea, which can make it a pain to clean at times. The tea pot also drips, though it is a fairly small amount. All in all, this is a good teapot for the price, and great for that big cup of tea in the morning."
4,LOVE THIS TEA SET FOR ONE!!!!,"I love the BIA Cordon Bleu 12-ounce Teapot and cup for One, it even came with a saucer. I am using it on my tray in my bedroom right now for accessorizing. I just love how it looks on black mosaic tray and black vase with white flowers."
5,Teapot and cup,Bought this as a gift and it was greeted with delight! No flaws on the pieces and all wrapped well so that no damage was sustained in shipment.
3,What I was Expecting,"Great if you are growing your hair out and done like being stuck with little pony tails. I did however clip a few strands of the hair piece to thin it out a little bit...It is a little thick for my tastes...nobody could tell that it was not my real hair! Only one down side, I was charged almost $17 for shipping. When I received my package, the shipping cost was only $3 dollars! I paid more for shipping than I did for the actual hair piece."
1,Not academic,"All the contradiction the author mention is not contradiction at all, there are many bible study books written can explain this with very convincing logic, however there are some real contradiction in deep meaning very hard to explain in the bible but the author never mention, those contradiction well known to any person study the bible seriously, in my opinion the author is not qualified to write in such a subject."
1,Would be great if it were true...,"Mr. Burr brings up some great points. Unfortunatly, many of the ""contradictions"" he lists are not contradictions at all. For example, one ""contradiction"" Burr lists in his book involves the genealogies of Christ. In the New Testament, there are two genealogies of Christ. One is in the book of Matthew, chapter 1, and another in the book of Luke, chapter 3. If you look at them, they look completely different. They don't even agree on Jesus' grandfather. The fact is, however, that these lists are not contradictory, but instead complementary. The genealogy in Matthew is Joseph's family line, while the one in Luke is Mary's.There are many cases like these. The he doesn't back up his claims..."
4,German Camouflage Schemes,"This book goes over camouflage schemes and markings of German military vehicles covering the entire range of war years. And all fronts. The book has many nice black and white war time photos. They show the various vehicles with they vast variety of schemes used. And the different methods used to apply them.Though I love the photo's, they are no very easy to use for reference in painting. But there are color plates of the various camouflage schemes shown in the photos and discussed. These will come in very handy for the modeler.I will be getting the other two volumes of this series."
2,More of the Lost Cause Perspective....,"A fine addition to the many volumes on Gettysburg. Great photos, text. This is a fine addition to anyone's Civil War library with one glaring exception. Mr. Symonds's reasoning on why the Confederates lost the battle, laying the entire blame on James Longstreet is nothing more than a perpetuation of the Lost Cause/Myth and Legend interpretation of the Battle of Gettysburg. Nearly a word for word reiteration of Jubal Early's completely fabricated version of the events surrounding the Gettysburg campaign. The discerning historian will want to seek other volumes, other ""versions"" to obtain a more objective and accurate story. For those reading about the battle for the first time, I would not recommend this book. Again, a fine collection of photography from the period but the author needs to read a little more on what actually happened from primary sources and not base his text on what transpired in the 1870's!"
2,Great photo imagery with lousy historiography,"Too bad the publisher could not have included text that would do justice to this volume's photo imagery. That is why for appearance and artistic design, the book rates 5 stars; however, for accuracy of historical text, Mr Symonds rates negative stars. The author advances so many myths (just two of the many horrendous myths advanced Mr Symonds are: 1) Longstreet is to blame for July 2 and; 2) Richard Ewell was given discretionary orders by Lee to pursue on July 1. Both are pieces of fiction that all too often repeated as fact) that the reader must simply consult many, more reliable texts on the battle.Need a coffeetable book to get someone's attention on Gettysburg? This will do it. Need a book to learn the facts about the battle? Don't open this one."
3,Hides...and pushes,"I know it's really too much to ask for a Control Brief that doesn't push some of the ""stuff"" you're trying to control up and over the waistband, so I tried to read all the reviews of various manufacturers to choose the one that seemed to do it the least. I've been fairly pleased with this one, it's comfortable and easy to get on and off, but it does cause rollover above the top of the garment."
5,Post surgery,"These were perfect for after inner thigh surgery, skin reduction following Bariatric surgery. Well worth the expense VS those aggravating wraps and spanx are just too tight for sensitive surgery sites."
1,Archaic Writing Style Makes It Unreadable,"I don't know if other writers from Terry's era wrote the same, but for someone in the present this book is terribly hard to read because of the writing style. Aside from this, of what I did manage to understand, I did not find the information in this book to be particularly enlightening. I was dissapointed over all the hoopla over it. I gladly sold my copy."
3,"OK CADDY, COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER","This shower caddy works ok, but I wish the over-the-shower head part was a little longer. I have an oversized shower head and the shelf on the caddy is too close to it. It is a little difficult getting larger shampoo bottles out of it. Also, the soap dish part could use a piece in front of it to keep the soap from falling out. I think I will go and physically buy one next time."
5,Great story about the reality of communism on Greece,"This is a fantastic true story about a boy, his mother and his family who are caught up in a communist revolution. If anyone is in doubt about what a choke hold communism can put on a country, see this movie."
4,Literature and Film,I'm a graduate student majoring in script writing. I recommend this book for those that are interested in adaptation.
1,Huh?,"Is this some kind of inside joke? What is going on here? Is it about a free trip to Portugal for Malkovich and Deneuve. This strange film has more story in the printed on-screen epilog than in the 90 preceding minutes. Talky and long static shots. If you look up ""PRETENTIOUS"" in the dictionary, there should be an image of this film's poster for a definition. It would be REALLY interesting to know the circumstances of how this movie got made. Maybe it was blackmail. Or everyone was kidnapped and it was shot under some kind of death threat. I can't imagine Malkovich and Deneuve read the script and agreed because of the story and I can't imagine they got big bucks because it looks like it was shot on no budget. Maybe Satan made them do it. But he already has a bad name. The only Faustian thing about this movie is that it's hell to sit through. I give it one star because it was in focus and I like the moss on one of the tree branches in a scene near the end."
1,The Movie to finally cure Insomnia!,"The only good thing about this movie is reading the other customers' reviews:I was laughing out loud as they are spot on: This movie is hilariously dull and ridiculous....I remember actually PAYING to see this at a film festival, thinking that with Deneuve and Malkovich it had to be ... interesting at least. Turns out the most interesting thing about this movie is how and why it was ever made.....now, THERE'S a theme for a movie!On the other hand, if you suffer from sleepness nights this will save you a doctor's prescription and a glass of pills, so it might come to use...You have been warned."
3,Very Unusual,"I am an avid John Malkovich movie goer, and i watched this film because of this reason. This is a strange movie. I liked the atmosphere that it gives and its ability to play with the mind of the viewer. Contrary to this, I didn't know what was with the music. But thats another story. watch the movie, and see what you think."
1,this movie doesn't deserve ANY stars,"I do love a good art film, but man, this one missed the mark, the ball park and any point it might be trying to make. The music was insanely bad, storytelling missing entirely (oh yeah, there is no story), the lighting was atrocious and absolutely nothing interesting happens. The characters are flat, completely unsubstantial and entirely confusing. They spend a lot of time reading Faust OUT LOUD, so if you don't know it intimately, and know if it is relevent to this self-gratifying piece of pretentious nonsense, don't bother. The only bright spot? Catherine Deneuve looks lovely as usual."
1,The Worst,This now ranks #1 on my Worst Films of All Time list. The only good thing about it was that it finally came to an end. Would be interested to learn how the stars were suckered into this disastrous project. Also would love to see it remade by Quentin Tarantino as high camp.
2,I've seen better of both Malkovich and Deneuve.,"After seening almost all of Deneuve's films and many of Malkovich, I can say this was not a favorite. Worth seeing if you are an avid fan of either, but don't expect much passion, character development or specific plot. To me, it was oppressive and choppy, lacking the intrigue both actors have, in the past, brought to their films."
4,good for parents,"She is going to give this to her Mom and Dad, they will love it and read it to her over and over,then she'l read it on her own! Great Christmas story with all kinds of excuses."
3,Darling Christmas Picture Book,"I can only give this book 3 stars, because in the series, there are a dime a dozen. It is cute and I added it to our Christmas picture books. The kids LOVED it. Nothing is funner for little kids than seeing a naughty little kid that doesn't listen and makes mistakes."
3,A cute review about a Little critter,This book was about a little critter that just wanted to make this christmas the BEST one ever for his mom then he went to sleep and santa came that night and he got every thing he wanted even to make his mom happy he even brought all the presents up the stairs so his mom wouldnt have to get out of bed so in the end it was the BEST christmas ever.
5,Cute,A great Little Critter book for those that collect. Like the others in the series the little critter tries to help but nothing turns out the way he expects.
1,Ineffective & uncomfortable.,"These headphones do NOT cancel any noise whatsoever. Moreover, they are heavy & uncomfortable. This is clearly a case of you get what you pay for."
3,"Good Value, Good Sound, ZERO Noise Cancellation","I've used these for about 3 years now. I like that they fold, look stylish, and sound pretty good. BUT, I bought them to reduce noise, and they don't really do that. I would give 5 stars if it reduced ambient noise. If you want a good pair of headphones, these are fine. But if you think the noise cancellation is going to do anything, you'll be disappointed. I bought them for use on the subway and I can't really use them for that since the ambient noise is still way too loud. Flipping the switch for noise reduction is just barely perceptible if you are concentrating and listening for it (in a quiet room!), but it essentially has no effect. Also, if your ears stick out a little bit like mine, your ears will start to hurt a little bit after about an hour of wearing because the mid-sized cups will press a little your ears."
3,Does not do a well noise job of canceling noise,It works ok but not really that great. The volume is really low and it doesn't cancel the noise as advertised. I would not recommend.
4,good headphones,"well for the price i got them for they work great, a low budget noise canceling head phones not like bose but will do the job ."
2,Only for soft use !,"I have bought this item to use during the travelling time in train. Unfortunately, this headphone was broken into 2 pieces after 4 months. So, I have learned that this is good only for soft use. This is not a good choice for a hard use."
2,A bit flimsy..,"I've owned these headsets for just over a month now. The padding on the ear cuffs keeps coming off and it is impossible to put it back on properly. I mostly just rely on the headset pressure (which is not bad) to hold them in place while wearing. The active noise cancellation does indeed work, but it really is no big deal (on this headset or any other). I never really even bother to turn it on anymore. Then general sound quality seems fair enough."
1,Poor performane. Foam eaeplugs work better,"I bought this item based on generally positive reviews. However, I am extremely disappointed. First, the strap squeezes the top of my head. After only a few minutes, it is quite uncomfortable, bordering on painful. I have tried these on 3, 7 hour flights and the noise cacellation is minimal at best. I compared them to foam ear plugs and the foam plugs are clearly better. I also compared them to a colleague's Bose head phones. No comparison!!!! The Bose set provided a drastic reduction in noise, blowing these Phillips headphones away. My in ear channel ear buds also worked better at reducing noise than the Phillips. I would not purchase these Phillips headphones with my current knowledge."
3,"noise isolation is so-so, sound quality sucks","The sound quality of these headphones are worse than skullcandies, and the noise isolation doesn't really block out much. I needed something for noise cancellation on the noisy subway, and I hear clearer sounds with my Klipsch earbuds than with these. Also, I bought these 2 wks ago for 25 bucks. Now, the price has gone up by 5? What's the deal, amazon?I don't recommend these headphones."
1,Plastic head straps break too easily,"I was happy with the electronics on these headphones and bought 2 of them. On BOTH, the headphone arms broke on the silver part, where the rectangular part meets the flimsy arms that go around the earpieces. I tried using crazy glue to fix them, but they just kept breaking. Now I'm shopping for something with a sturdier design."
2,Does Not Cancel Sound,"All outside noise is still audible - conversations, power tools, vacuum, everything!The only way to cancel out ambient sound it to turn the volume up. Purpose: Defeated.Sound quality is good but headphones are not good at anything else.Do not but if you are looking for silence in your surroundings as I was."
3,Needs to cancel more and draw less power!,"I like the way these fold up to take up about as much room as a (slightly flattened) softball. They also offer good full ear coverage (even with my giant ears). Sound quality isn't too bad for the price/size. A couple issues- the noise canceling could go a farther; I've used other phones (Sony) that reduce the bus rumble a bit more. They also require full volume output from my iPod, leaving little room to ""go to 11."" Unlike some other noise-canceling phones they don't boost the sound level when you flip on the cancel switch. Which by the way is tricky to operate with the headphones on, it's flush with the surface and has only a little groove to catch onto. As other reviewers have pointed out they are a bit tight and don't breath well, though that's a tough trick to pull off with over-the-ear phones. But overall I'd call them a good value."
4,The Big Head Speaks Out...,"First off, let's get one fact out of the way, I have a big head! My head is 24"". My wife's waist is, that's right, 24"". I hope that puts it into perspective. I find these headphones quite comfortable. I give them 4 stars on that fact alone. I know some people have had issues with comfort. I just bought these, maybe there is something different about the new ones.The noise cancelling is almost useless at blocking higher frequencies, but does a cracker-jack job at blocking low frequencies. The sound quality is decent, but I am not a good judge really. I have a pair of Grado SR-60s and they are a bad measuring stick because they are fantastic.Comfort - 4 starsSound - 3 starsI would give them a 3.5 if I could."
2,Cancels noise but not sturdy,I had to order another pair of these because part of the plastic on the band broke and made them unwearable.
4,For the price,"I give this four stars because they do work moderately, and they were very inexpensive. So, as a backup pair they are just fine to keep around because they are cheap. In no shape or form could you compare them to a Sennheiser or a Bose"
2,Not so great,"These required a battery, which was annoying to me because they wouldn't work without them. And then they broke. The wiring was not secure enough and I lost sound in one ear. I bought a cheaper pair that worked twice as well after these."
3,What Happened to the Price?,"I have bought several of these headphones over the years because it is an excellent product. However, is there some reason why they price jumped almost 500%?!? This product used to be $40.00, and now it is $195.00? All I can say is WOW!!! It's disappointing, because I'm sure not going to buy it at the current price when I used to get them for much much much cheaper."
2,"too small, noise reduction- I don't use it","Ear things are too small, hurt my ears. Made for kid size ears. Sound is fine. Noise reduction wasn't very impressive, so I never use it. You get what you pay for. I still use them, but they hurt."
3,above average for the $$$ value,"Ok so i borrowed this headphones from my friend and i am using for a week. These are good for extended period of use (about 3-4 hrs), have decent sound quality...but i've experienced much much better ones like Razer baracuda hp-1. ofcourse they are about $40-50 more than these ones.BOTTOM LINE: good for the money but wont make you go WOW!"
2,So I picked up these phones...,"I'm just a teenage guy who wants to listen to his music. I've owned a few headphones in the $[...] range and decided to pick these up with high hopes. I was very excited to open the package and test out these babies.However, within an instant I noticed the very poor sound quality. Compared to my $[...] Koss pair, that is broken due to poor construction and cheap plastic, these sounded like utter crap. It was actually hard listening to music with the HN 110 on. Like a few others have said, the bass sucks, and there is no clarity or crispness in the vocals at all. I wish I could return it and just buy a $[...] pair of good sounding phones.I can't say I am an audiophile or anything, but even a child can tell the difference between the sound quality of these headphones and real good sounding ones."
2,Headphones hurt!,"The headphones were at a cheap price so I decided to purchase being completely ignorant to what a good pair of headphones really were. I have a rather wide head so the headphones really hurt after say, 20 minutes. I read that nothing is truly ""noise canceling"" but it does the job. After purchasing these, I gave them away and bought the Bose QC2 which is a much better product than this. Of course, it cost 3x more too but was worth it. I love the feel of it on my ""wide"" head.If you have a thin head and just want to get the job done, buy these.If you are picky, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME or MONEY!"
2,For small heads/ears only,"If you are a male with an average or larger sized head and ears you will not be happy with this headset. The cups are too small. There is no way my ears entirely fit into the cups so they put very uncomfortable pressure on either the front or back, top or bottom of my ears, depending on how they are positioned. I can't wear these more than a few minutes before the discomfort turns to pain. Otherwise I have no problem with any aspect of the product. The sound cancellation is equal or better than other headsets I have tried. Great product and a great price, but only for those with smaller than average head or ear size."
5,comfortable and good sound,"I've had several over-the-ear headphones before and none of them have sounded as good or been as comfortable as these. I have glasses and these don't push against them. They fit my ears very well and are adjustable so they can fit any one. They have very good sound for the average person, however if you want to use them profesionally* I would suggest Bose. Overall I find them to be fantastic."
3,Noise reduction very inefective and wires not coated well enough for the price,"I returned the product. The noise reduction was very ineffective.I'd rather buy a Stenheuser over the ear without noise reduction for1/2 the price. It will do the same job as this one does.About materials: the wires are too thinly coated.This makes them susceptible to breaking. I would hate to havejust one side working. I thought Phillips could makethe wires properly coated, the noise reduction really operativeand also make that wire come just from one side.Got it, tested and sent it back in less than 10 minutes.Too cheaply made for the price."
2,Really uncomfortable,"While the headphones work well with good quality and the noise canceling feature is nice, none of that matters since these headphones are ridiculously uncomfortable. The strap over the head is very tight and constantly feels like it's pulling on you. I guess with headphones like these it's probably good to be ready to send them back if you don't like the comfort."
3,Philips HN 110 Folding Noise-Canceling Headphones - review,These headphones sound very good and do a very goodjob of silencing low frequency sounds. They do apoor job of silencing medium to high frequencysounds. So they don't seem to be working whenpeople are talking or the TV is on. Theyare a very good value.
5,So happy!,"Ive been searching for a good, inexpensive set of over-the-ear headphones and these are everything I wanted and more! They are so comfortable, noise cancellation is par, and sound quality is up there with any bose I've heard once you turn em on! The folding is another huge bonus! I'm showing them off to all my audiophile friends and they can't believe I only paid 40$ for them. These truly are the hidden gem of headphones, and I'm glad I read the reviews on amazon for this set...great buy!"
2,Weak noise cancelling for NYC,I live in NYC and am constantly bombarded with annoying sounds. got these after reading a lot of reviews and wasn't expecting them to be that bad. they are not good at all. the noise canceling function is a joke. it barely cancels any noise at. they are a good bargain to get something decent for $38 but i would not recommend them to anyone. i could easily here people next to me on the subway and hear just about every other sound. what a rip off.
2,Philips HN 110 Noise-Canceling Headphones,"Disappointed with Philips. The Philips HN 110 Folding Noise-Canceling Headphones do not noticeably cancel noise and they are uncomfortable to wear. Save your money and buy comfortable, non-noise cancelling headphones."
4,Great value,"I don't know why this product has received such bad reviews for comfort. They're just as comfortable as other around-the-ear pairs I've worn, and the band is not as tight (on me, at least) as others have reported. Great sound quality; excellent value for the price."
4,Good headphones,"Good sound and price, might be more comfortable, satisfied with the product. I recommend it for moderate use at home or walk."
4,Good value headphones,"I use these at work, in a large, open office space, when I am catching up on busy work. They are fairy comfortable for up to a couple of hours use. They reduce but by no means eliminate noise -- I can still overhear conversations in the next cubicle over. The sound quality is pleasing. Overall, well worth the money."
1,Really uncomfortable,"These headphones feel like a vice grip trying to crush your head. My ears and the side of my face are in pain after wearing these for an hour. Unless your head is only 2-3 inches wide, these are likely to cause a lot of discomfort. Otherwise they seem fine, and I'd keep them if there weren't so darn uncomfortable, but man are they bad."
3,Noise Reduction not that great and people around you will still be able to hear your music,"I purchased this here on Amazon because of the positive reviews, but I was not pleased and I am returning the product. I really wanted something that is good at noise reduction, but more than anything - I wanted a headset that prevents people around me from hearing my music. When I am on a plane, I don't like to bother the people around me or be asked to turn my music down, so I wanted a headset that will muffle the sound strongly enough that I won't be bothering others."
2,Not Nearly as good as i thought it was gonna be,"Ok so i was wasn't expecting this product to be anything near as good as say a Bose headset but it was hardly better than my normal (non-noise reducing) headphones. The sound quality is fine and its comfortable to wear, but i thought i was getting a ""noise reducing"" headset. Really that's my only, but BIGGEST problem with these headphones, so really i payed twice as much for headphones i already have."
2,uncomfortable,the noise cancel feature worked fine and the sounds were good for the price. The biggest drawback was comfort. They start to hurt after about 5 minutes. Definitely not good for long travels.
2,"Minimal noise canceling, doesn't muffle speech frequencies","Only mildly muffles very low frequencies, like the sound of a dishwasher, but even that is extremely minimal. The ear shape is odd and ill fitting."
1,Doesn't work AT ALL!,"I ordered these a few days ago. I received them today and I've already returned them to Amazon. These didn't cancel a single bit the noise that you'd actually wanted to cancel out.For instance, with the headphones I couldn't hear myself typing on my keyboard, but I could still hear noises outside (while I was upstairs on the 3rd floor) just as clearly as ever. The noise canceling effect is the same as when your ears are clogged on an airplane. You can still hear everything, it's just slightly (very slightly) muffled. I actually canceled out more noise just by putting my fingers in my ears.BTW, I'm not totally unreasonable as to think that a product like this could cancel out ALL noise, but the fact that these headphones cancel out NO noise is unacceptable.Don't waste your money!"
5,Philips HN 110 Folding Noise-Canceling Headphones,Got these for a gift and my son-in-law really likes them. He also uses them when mowing and said they are great.
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good product for the price. The sound canceling is not that amazing and when the batteries go low it messes with the sound (but that is easily fixable and isn't a problem). Basically these are good headphones, have good sound, have decent sound canceling, are relatively comfortable, and are very convenient. Good seller and came as described."
4,"Great Value, Good Product","I have purchased other noise-canceling headphones before, so I have some experience with a similar product. However, this pair of headphones actually encloses the ears rather than simply covering the ears.Overall I am pleased with the headphones, though the tightness of the headphones against the skin around the ears is a bit much after a few hours. The intention I guess is to isolate the ears, and it does a good job at that.The sound quality is excellent, with great bass and overall a good listening experience.In low light it is hard to find the on and off switch for the headphones, but the switch is designed so it is hard to accidentally switch on and drain the battery.For the price this is a great value and my wife field tested them on a flight to Europe and reports they did a good job of making the jet cabin noise bearable during her flight."
2,"The sound and noise canceling was okay, but the build was poor","Well, this head phone is not very durable as mine broke in a mid-range stress brought by my everyday-bag-handling when its stored away (yes, that's just to-and-from commute, I haven't even brought it to hiking--or maybe I just have a really large cranium because of my ever expanding brain, that's why the headphone broke).Comfort is another thing; the ear mounts are too narrow it gives me pain on the back of my ears in a few hours. The arc connecting the left and right phone is also a pain on the top of my head; it has little padding, but that's not enough for comfort in hours of listening.On the upside (which I intentionally put last), it's cheap, it sounds okay, and I can definitely notice the noise canceling, even if it's not that significant."
2,No noise reduction!,"I purchased this item in anticipation of a plane trip to Europe, hoping to be able to enjoy movies. There was no perceptible noise reduction and movie dialog was imperceptible. A waste of money."
3,"Out of the box, didn't work in one ear","If these worked out of the box, they would've been good, but never worked. The connection to the music device was shorted out, so forcfully bending the cable 90 degrees got me sound out of both ears, but with some static. The comfort was fine, the sound canceling was fine, but the quality was bad. Plus, there is a pin in the end of the cable that connects to your music device, that little pin always stayed in the plug of my ipod/computer, whatever it was plugged in to. I returned mine after my trip and am looking for a different brand..."
4,Great gift item,"This product was purchased as a gift, actually as a replacement for a pair of headphones that I had accidentally broken. My sister and family claim that the Phillips HN 1100 Folding Noise-Canceling Headphones to be a far superior item then the one they had and are very, very satisfied. And I for one am extremely happy with Amazon.com for being so user friendly with respects to the ease of making purchases and receiving products in a timely manner."
2,Poor Comfort,There is really no way to tell from the picture but these headphones are too small for human ears. Neither fits on or over the ears. They are certainly tall enough but not wide enough. No humans have this ear profile. The sound canceling circuit is OK but should be more powerful and the the sound deadening properties of the materials used in construction are nil. Could be OK for people using occasionally on short occasions.
4,Philips Noise Canceling Headphones,"I have had these headphones for about 7 months and have used them on at least 3 trips to and from Europe. Overall, I have been very pleased with the performance of these headphones. They are reasonably comfortable and do reduce cabin noise during flight. The sound is very good although they seem a little weak on the high end (treble). The travel pouch is nice and includes an airline plug adapter. A good value at the time for around $35.00."
3,Extras add up,"I purchased these headphones to use on a long airline flight. Before I left, I decided that I needed a more substantial carrying case for them; that's where I had my first problem. There are no cases on the market for headphones like these. I ended up with a camera case that is small but bulky. On the plane, I dealt with the awkward on/off switch that other reviewers mentioned. After my flight, I turned off the headphones and stored them in the case I purchased. Unfortunately, when I took them out of the case for another flight several days later, the headphones were turned on and the battery was dead. Luckily, I had a spare battery. I made a point to make sure I turned the heaphones of at the end of the flight, but unfortunately, on the next flight, the headphones were (again) on, and the battery was dead."
4,HELP,"I AM LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL NEGATE THE NOISE OF MY NEIGHBOR WHO LOVES TO PLAY HIS MUSIC, TV AND HELL KAROKE SO LOAD IT HURTS MY EARS. EARPLUGS WORK BUT THEY HURT AFTER A FEW HOURS ANYONE KNOW IF THESE ACTUALLY WILL DROWN THE IDIOT OUT?IF SO LET ME KNOW AND I WILL BUY WHATEVER WORKSI CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE UGHEVERYONE GOES ON ABOUT HOW WONDERFUL THEY SOUND BUT DO THEY KILL NOISE YOU KNOW MAKE LIFE PEACEFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Review,Headset was received on the date and in the condition promised. Item was a gift so I have not used it but assume it works properly. I would definitely order from Beach Audio again.
1,NO GOOD HEADPHONES,"CHEAP HEADPHONES, IF YOUR LOOKING FOR NOISE CANCELING HEADPHONE WHIT BASS THIS IS NO THE HEADPHONE FOR YOU..............."
1,ripped off,"Got ripped off, paid for this item from acehardwareoutlet seller and never got it. Got an email from Amazon costumer service saying someone accepted this item, and there was an acceptance signature. Well, right now someone is enjoying this headphone paid by me. I strongly suggest not doing business with them. I am also disappointed with Amazon costumer service."
1,The most painful headphones I ever tried,"This morning I went to Target and bought the HN 110 for 59$ (without checking the price at Amazon before, how dumb of me...).I went to work and tried them as soon as I got there : they fitted perfectly on my ears and look really nice, that was a good start.Then I turned the Noise Canceling on and I couldn't hear the loud AC anymore! Great. I could still hear my coworkers ringtones, but well, they're not suppose to cancel the high frequency sounds. Sorry, they won't be a cure for the crying baby on a 9 hours flight!I plugged them in my computer and turned the music sound : crisp, good quality. I was delighted.BUT, one hour later, they were not comfortable anymore. In fact, they were awfully PAINFUL.I returned them right after work...!I stopped wearing them 7 hours ago, I my head still hurts!Philips shouldn't even sell them. The designer or the cost-cutter who decided no to pad those two sections did a really bad mistake."
1,Poorly Built and Now Unusable,"Length:: 0:18 MinsI bought these headphones for travel from Target about 9 months ago. Like the other reviews, sound quaility has been okay. The problem is that about 2 months after purchasing, they started falling apart.First the side plastic pieces, then internally in the connection to the headband so they were only connected by the leather. I struggled through using them for that period.Now thin metal connectors are popping out of the leather that poke into your head. THEY ARE NOW ABSOLUTELY USELESS.They came with a fake leather travel bag that they have always traveled in. They travel in my computer bag with all other gear.Look at the video - I would highly recommend you find something else and not waste your money."
3,"Great Noise Cancelling, but agree about the bad comfort.","Maybe there is some sort of cover you can put over the part that goes over your head, because that hurts. I thought on my first wear that I couldn't tell what people were talking about the fit. Then on my second try after just an hour I started getting a headache, and could really feel the two sections on the top of my head, and it was the reason for my headache. I am going to see if there is a cover of some sort to buy, so I can keep them, because besides the hurt, they sounded good, and I liked how they cover your entire ear."
2,Not very durable,"I've worn these regularly for three months, the noise cancelling works well on things like fans but poorly on more complex sounds. After two months of use the support arms on one side broke, I had to make a support system out of duct tape and pieces of a wire coat hanger. The other side broke two days ago and I had to do the same it. Now the tape makes it so it can't close or fold properly and the bottom doesn't close completely over my ear but it's still better than having jagged plastic poking into my temple."
1,brittle,"i have had these 6 months, and they have broken already. the folding portion is poorly constructed. they were under normal usage conditions, i hardly folded them. cheap. bad news."
2,Not worth the money,"I got these as a gift for someone after buying another brand of noise cancelling headphones for myself and falling in love with them. These -seemed- like a good deal but the fit on these leaves something to be desired. The Philips look like an ""over the ear"" design but the ear cups are actually too small (and I have small ears). The build quality is decent but the noise reduction is only so-so and noticably inferior compared to the Sony version (granted, these cost a lot less).Long story short, spend the extra money on the Sonys."
4,did what i expected,"i bought these to replace a older broken set of headphones. they are a decent headphone, they did what i needed, i use them for traveling once or twice a year, not everyday use. they do what i need them too. i do not expect them to sound like my home surround system, they played music just fine. no complaints about the sound quality, but then again i did not think they would "" make it sound like the band was right there"" they are $20 headphones and they worked for what i needed. my only reason for not giving them a 5 is i wish they had a volume control on the headphones. other then that i enjoyed them. they seem pretty sturdy and made well."
3,"It's not Bose, but it's not $350 either","Definitely not noise-cancelling; they are more like noise-reducing. The sound is pretty decent, but not great. However, they are worth the $40 price tag. I used them on a trip from Tampa, Florida to Southeast Asia and I was satisfied with them, but not in love with them. As long as you don't expect Bose performance and realize you usually get what you pay for, you won't be disappointed."
4,Noise cancelled - almost,"I prefer the over the ear as opposed to the on the ear design. However, these are much lighter than what I was using and they do work well. I use them on airplanes and they do not block as much noise as I expected but they are better than what I had. For the price, I think they are very good. The on/off switch is hard to find without taking the headsets off."
2,Youch! I Must Have Big Ears,"Actually, I had never given any thought at all to the size of my ears -- until, that is, I got these headphones. And the big headache that goes along with them when I use them.The earpads are simply too small and the head band too tight for comfort. No luck when I tried bending the band to enlarge it.The noise-reduction switch does seem to work well -- otherwise, these headphones would have rated one star.I've now bought a different brand. I cannot recommend these."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I got these headphones for a trip to Europe. I figured, hey, what better way to sleep on a noisy plane than with noise-cancelling headphones?! I did some research and learned that the technology is great for droning noises (like and airplane engine), so I figured I'd be set. Sadly, these didn't perform very well. I couldn't tell the difference between them being off or turned on in terms of noise cancelling ability. While listening to music through them, it sounded distant and wasn't of the best quality. From now on, I'll just stick to my ear buds and ear plugs instead. I mean, I *could* purchase some $300 noise cancelling headphones, but for the odd flight, I don't think it's worth it."
2,Below average $30 Noise Cancelling Headphones,I bought a pair of $40 headphones in an airport a couple years ago that have developed a hiss so I thought I would buy a new pair and try these out.- The seal around the ears is bad and turning my head from side to side at all would result in a loss of seal and about a doubling of engine noise.- Sound quality is a little lower than you would expect from even $30 headphones.+ The folding action makes them really compact in a backpack for traveling.Overall I wouldn't recommend them. I don't know what to recommend but I'll be trying another pair. Perhaps a more expensive pair that'll last more than a year and keep a good seal comfortably.
2,"You're Kidding, Right?","I got these headphones for an overseas trip with hopes that they would cancel out most of the noise on the plane and allow me to clearly hear music. The noise cancelling is a joke. My non-noise cancelling Audio Technica M50's (incredible headphones) do more or equal noise cancelling just from their ear cups. On these Philips headphones there is really no ""Active"" noise cancelling as the product states. They really rely on passive noise cancelling, which is FAR from that of Bose or its decent competitors, which this is not.At $50 they make a decent pair of standard headphones, which is what they are, but you could definitely find something better for the same price. I have to say, these are a disappointment after hearing Bose's QC15 and thinking that these would even come close."
2,Noise cancelling stopped working after 6 months,Noise cancelling stopped working after 6 months. Instead get a lot of loud popping when new battery put in. A lot of money they want for headphones that don't last.
2,Inferior to my $20 Sony in-ear earbuds,"They fit okay, and seem fairly durable. I've had them for a few years now. The positives stop there, though. The sound quality isn't very good, and although noise canceling will cut out a little noise, I have a pair of $20 Sony in-ear earbuds that block out more noise (including on airplanes) and sound a lot better. Not to mention they take up a lot less space..."
2,Fair,"The sound is average & the durability is fair. They lasted a month and they broke. I bought a pair Sony headphones & they have been great. Overall, I would not recommend them."
4,"Lasted for 3 years, then broke","I love these headphones because the sound was so clear and I felt like I was in my own world when I was listening to music. I use them with my ipod, iphone and my yamaha keyboard. They folded up nicely and I could travel with them. They were great when I wanted to listen to music on my computer and shut the outside world down. The only thing is, the bracket that goes over your head broke (just like my friend's pair did). While they still technically work, the bracket is flopping around. I always treated them gentle too but I guess 3 years must be the life of them."
2,"Uncomfortable fit, noise canceling so-so","My biggest complaint is that my ears hurt after wearing them for more than 15 minutes. I'm not sure why they designed the ear cups to be a long oval shape. The noise-canceling is so-so; I fly a lot and the noise canceling is somewhat of a reprieve from the sounds of flying, but it's nothing special."
4,Great headphones for the money,"I ordered the unit 5 days before my long trip from Seattle to Istanbul. It arrived in 3 days and it turned out to be a great investment. It really cuts down the roar of the wind and engine noise during flight at least by 60%. There is no hiss or other noticible noise when turned on. The only problem is it gets a little uncomfortable after 2 hours of wearing it. The ear cups are a little small, so, the ears seem to touch the interior, but that is not a big discomfort. If you have snall ears (a pettite lady for instance) it would be perfect. The fact that they fold neetly and fit in the provided pouch makes it easy to stuff in your carry on.I am glad I purchased them and I will take them with me on all long flighs."
2,Not good value,I mistakenly purchased these because when they arrived I realized that they appeared to be exactly the same as an old pair of Philips headphones I had. The old ones didn't fit good and the muffs did not do a good job of reducing the sound.I returned these and purchased ABLE PLANET NC200B which are perfect. Spend just a little more and get a much better product.
1,Don't throw your money away on Phillips HN 110 Headphones,"I am greatly disappointed in these headphones. I bought them because they claim to be noise canceling. NOT! They look impressive, BUT......... I can't tell that they reduce noise at all, and the the little earbuds that came with my MP3 player have a better quality of sound. They are a bit cumbersome to unfold and put on and they become uncomfortable after a little while. I will probably give them to the church flea market. Someone will be happy to try them for two or three dollars."
3,Does not work well on airplanes,"I purchased this because I travel a lot. It didn't really drowned out the airplane noise at all. Also one of the speakers in the headphones busted, so I had to return it. If you're looking for noise-canceling for airplanes, these are NOT the ones for you."
4,Headphones met my expectations,"Very good product for the price. I've been studying in a room with an air condenser in the ceiling, which is very loud. These do a good job of cancelling some of the noise meeting my expectations, so I am able to listen to lectures/music. These have similar noise cancelling capability as $100 pair, which my friend uses to study with in the same noisy room. Compared to Phillips earbud noise cancelling headphones, these do a much better job at cancelling noise. The cups fit comfortably around my ears, but with prolonged use the skin touching the vinyl covered foam padding gets damp. The sound quality is very good but not as good as Sennheiser HD 202, which are not noise cancelling headphones. These headphones fold up and have a travel bag, a real plus."
3,Comfortable and portable,"The headphones are really comfortable and easy to travel with, but after flying around 40 hours in the past 3 weeks, I am not convinced they are ""noise-canceling""...""noise-reducing"" at best. I found myself on the airplane trying to watch a movie on my computer with the volume at highest, crouching forward toward the computer to try to hear better (as if that would work). Also, the battery already died after less than 5 hours of use."
2,Noise Cancellation did not work,"There are a lot of good reviews, so it is quite possible I simply got a bad pair.I tested it out in three places. Next to a garbage disposal, near a noisy fan, and next to a lawn mower (I have been on planes that sound like our lawn mower).The noise cancellation did almost nothing. Switching on and off did make it sound a little different, but otherwise did nothing.So I went back to using earbuds under plain ear protection (ear muffs). I added a star, since the return was an easy process."
2,Poor Quality - Cheap Workmanship,"The sound quality of these phones is not bad, good range with live tones and acceptable bass. The noise canceling abilities are very marginal however. Where these really fall down compared to the Bose is the absolute lack of quality materials. I have exchanged two pairs and am on my third because the cheap plastic used on the pieces that attach the actual headphones to the headband. With normal daily use (I'm a designer who listens to music while I work) all three pairs developed cracks in a month or two. The third pair's left ear piece broke completely off after about 8 months. Some might say that's reasonable but I don't think that's worth the $50 I paid. I will be mailing these to Philips and see what they will do for me. I probably will spring for the extra money and buy a nice pair of Bose next..."
1,Noise-canceling a joke,"I stupidly lost my trusted pair of Audio Technica headphones (always double check your possessions before you walk off a plane!) and didn't want to spend too much money on a replacement, so I ordered these.I was shocked to discover that its noise-canceling ability is practically zero! It put hardly a dent in the gentle background noise of the highway outside my apartment. I don't think these could be effective at all onboard an airplane, which is where I would have used them the most.Here's my good old pair of headphones:Audio Technica ATH-ANC7B Active Noise-Cancelling Closed-Back HeadphonesI think I'm going to shell out the money for another pair of these."
1,Nope...,"I bought these in the store for about $60 and returned them as soon as I could. I tried them on and found that the metal slider extender piece got caught very easily in my hair (taking them on and off). For that reason alone, I returned them to the store. I felt it was a poor design flaw."
2,"Great, if you like big booms","If you listen to music with as much subtly as a 2x4 to the head, then these are for you! I listen to a wide range of musics including classical and world music and these headphones, unfortunately, don't do these kinds of music justice. I'm listening to the last scene of Donizetti's Maria Stuarda and mostly I'm hearing the bass drum. Hello?!? There's a soprano singing her heart out! If all that you care to hear is a big booming bass, then these will be a-okay. Otherwise, try something else."
3,Too tight but works well,"Used this on recent trip - too tight on my head. After an hour I was glad to get them off. The sound was very good and the NC worked rather well. Nonetheless, I will pass them on to my sons and purchase something more comfortable."
4,Good Value for Price,"I bought this for $30 and don't regret it. They fold nicely so that you can easily take them places. They also are comfortable and have pretty good quality. However mine were broken when i got them so the noise canceling feature doesn't work. If it was the full price (~$100 i think) I wouldn't recommend buying them if the noise cancelling doesnt work, but it's fine for me cuz i got them at a discounted price."
3,Good job cancelling noise but an earcup fell off,"I bought these headphones to wear while cutting the grass and was very impressed for a while - I only had to turn up the volume on the music a little bit. For noise cancelling, I'd give these five stars.Eventually the left earcup fell off so they are no longer useful for the purpose for which they were bought. They made through a year before breaking so two stars for quality.Comfort isn't so good either. Two stars for comfort."
3,Better Than Most,"I've had my head phones for little over a year now. I found them comfortable to wear and not too trying on the ear drums, which was what I really wanted. All in all, the product I expected.However, less than a month ago some of the screws came out on the left side of the headphones, and the plastic began to crack. The metal bands that run over the head (keeping the ear phones in place) have come loose, and now my headphones resemble a do-it-yourself project.This is unfortunate, because they still work fine.I'm not giving it a 4 because I'm not sure what caused the cracking and loose screws. However, I will add that up until last month, I was extremely happy with this product, and would have readily recommended it to anyone. I only wish it had lasted longer."
3,"Headphones ok, but noise canceling does not work","Most of the noise reduction is due to the padding on the headset and the minimal amplification of the sound. The noise cancelation feature provides a very small amount of improvement. This headset does not work well in an airplane environment or even a gym with the sound of machines operating. It is better than the simple ear buds, and for the money a better investment than ear buds, and non over the ear headphones. The folding feature is very good."
4,Works great worth the $,"These headphone worked great on a recent flight. Worth every penny, and it's much cheaper then similar products"
4,Excellent for the price.,"This replaces a similar Phillips headphone that was broken by a flight attendant. The improvement over the older model is that the battery goes into the headphone housing, rather that a separate compartment. The sound is good for phones at this price. Bass is emphasized, while high frequencies could be stronger. Comfort is fairly good because the phones go around the ears rather than on them, although the fit is a bit tight and not adjustable. Noise reduction is quite effective and does the job intended. Well packaged and comes with all necessary accessories, even a battery. A great buy at Amazon's price."
2,Not much better than cupping your hands over your ears.,"The package says they cancel 75% of noise. I barely noticed the difference between on and off when a person was talking to me. I turned on loud music and it was noticeable, but not much better than if I press my hands against my ears. I'd say they cancel 25% of noise,that's just my speculation, but I know its less than 50%. I returned them immediately."
2,not what I anticipated,I thought they would really do more noise cancelling however they do not. I bought this to be able to work amid noisy situations. They do cut down on the noise but cancel it? absolutely not!
2,Not too impressed,"I bought the phillips HN Folding Noise-cancelling Headphones for 35 dollars. They are normally 75, I believe. I think 35 is still too much. I bought them to use on the plane. However, when I tried them, there was virtually no difference when the noise cancel was turned on or off. And the sound wasn't as good as the stock ipod ear-buds. They would distort at a relatively low level. I would highly recommend another headphone."
1,Philips Noise cancelling - Buy Jabra instead,"I live on airplines. Platinum for life on American. Noise cancelling headphones are the best way for me to get deep sleep, besides the shades. Surest way to minimize the effect of jet-lag.Being the cheap guy that I am, I did not want to pay $300 for the Bose. I bought Jabras. 60 odd bucks. Loved 'em. Ofcourse you get what you pay for, cheap plastic and within a year the plastic started cracking.Needed a replacement and I bought these Philips. Complete and total waste of $70. I have done a side by side test of the Philips vs the Jabra. Philips barely cancels the noise.DO not waste your money with the Philips. I am now going to go buy another Jabra."
4,Great Product,"It fits really well on the ears, have a great sound fidelity and the noise canceling works very well."
4,"Works, but it much smaller and cheaper feeling than I imagined","Works, but it much smaller and cheaper feeling than I imagined. I wanted a earphone that would cover the whole ear, and these do, but not as much as I wished. It will work..."
4,Noise cancellation as advertised,"I gave this as a gift, but I did have a chance to try it out.--Noise cancellation works as advertised--putting the headphones on and off, you can hear droning environmental noises (fridge, lawnmower, traffic, etc.) fade away--Fits comfortably over your whole ear. I don't like those on-ear headphones because I wear glasses.--Sound is fine, but I'm no audiophile--Comes with an adapter for the fat jack on fancy stereo equipment--Comes with a cheap synthetic sack for stowage"
2,Tap ... Tap ... Are these things ON?,"My wife and I have very, very different tastes in music. When we visit out-of-state relatives I do the driving. I'd like to listen to some of my CDs on the trip, but her Ipod's ear buds let too much sound in -- she can't enjoy her music unless I turn mine all the way down.I got these headphones to help her block out my music so she can hear hers. That would be a ""Win-Win"" situation. I haven't tried these headphones in this situation yet, but I did try them myself, in the house. I can honestly say that I cannot tell any difference whatsoever in extraneous noise whether the noise canceling circuit is on or off.On the plus side, the padded ear cups do block much of the outside noise, and they aren't nearly as bulky as the Koss Pro4AAT headphones I use in the living room, so they may still be enough, but I'm very disappointed with the lack of any active noise canceling."
3,"Nice Cans, But Open Back is Loud","The headphones were nice - they fit well, folded easily, had a cute little bag. Unfortunately, I'm a huge proponent of closed-back headphones, and not only were these open-back but they were also LOUD. I tested them: I could hear the music playing with surprising clarity from a good distance away, when they were on someone else. I thought they were loud enough to be obnoxious so I returned them. They did have very nice sound, however, and seemed to be built sturdily enough. I'm just not into broadcasting.On a side note: I purchased the warranty that was offered with the phones, and that warranty is proving to be a hassle to return."
2,Decent value but cheap construction,"I enjoyed these while they lasted, but in less than a year the plastic deteriorated and the left ear cup fell off. They literally fell apart. They're fine for light use, but if you travel a lot then I recommend you spend the money for a sturdier pair with a hard carrying case."
3,Nice Low End Product,They are OK and work fine.But don't fool yourself into thinking you will get the Bose quality.There is a reason for the price difference.
4,Highly Recommended,"First of I need to disclose that I got these from Amazon on sale for $28.52.So understand when I say this is the best VALUE for your money. Are they better than the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones? No they're not but they're also not $300.The sound quality for me is good enough that if there was something better I probably could not distinguish the difference. I play mostly P2P downloaded mp3s on my iPod they aren't of the highest quality to begin with. They fit comfortably without any issues whatsover, the fact that they can be folded is a bonus. I highly recommend these for people not angry at their money."
2,Folding is the only nice feature,"I liked the full-size Philips noise canceling headphones. When those broke, being stuffed into my laptop bag once too much, I decided to go with the folding model. Unfortunately, the bargain price delivers a cheap product. The noise cancellation is bad, the fit uncomfortable and I preferred to take them off on my 12+ hour airplane journey than endure the discomfort. I would spend the extra $$ for the full size Philips that I found more comfortable than the Bose QC3's I had bought earlier."
5,Fine product,"For the price, this product is excellent. Since I've never owned a really expensive set of noise-canceling headphones, I don't know how to compare it to them. Some sound does come through but from what I've read, that's to be expected. I'm very pleased with the product."
2,Not the best noise cancelling headphone,"Not the best noise canceling headphones, but if you are looking for something cheap (n not willing to pay over $200) they are quite nice."
2,i returned them immediately,"these headphones cannot be worn for more than a short while before they cause extreme discomfort on the side of the ears. the band presses them tightly on the sides of my head and made it painful to wearm them for extended periods.also, the noise cancelling switch is located in an awkward position behind the ears, and is difficult to switch once you ge them on your head. also, they quicxkly began making crackling noises in the music. lastly, i bought them at best buy at they cost full retail, which is rape. i reccomend somethingg liek the sennheiser pxc 300's. they are a bit more expensive but very comfortable and have excellent sound."
2,Nothing like Bose,"I see some have posted reviews claiming this product ""is nearly as good on noise reduction"" or ""wholly equal"" or ""as comfortable"" as any of the Bose QuietComfort products.Apparently those reviewers were trying to be comical. We give them that benefit of our doubt (assuming comedic intent, instead of delusional thinking).I have several of the Bose QC products, and also now have used this Philips product for a week.This product is not comfortable. The noise reduction is hardly noticeable for sound frequencies it is supposed to reduce. The ear cups are too small to fit around most ears. The pads are too stiff. This product is kinda pricey because there are competitors priced $10 less that are its equal. The real reason this Philips headset is more is that the overall mechanical design is too complex, not designed for low-cost manufacturing."
2,Not as good as the original,"I'm not sure what went wrong between my first and second pair of these, it may be where they are made. This set, the right earpiece doesn't reduce sound as much as the left. And, both don't reduce noise in the crucial middle frequencies as they should. I'm quite disappointed in the performance of these. Also, for some inexplicable reason, they wrapped the cord into an impossibly tight roll when packaging so now I have a cord that is always getting tangled and kinked. Stay away from these. However I'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because when I turn off the noise cancelling they are a decently good sounding and comfortable pair of ordinary headphones for listening to audiobooks when I'm at home."
4,philips redesigned these,philips remade these and they seem to look alot better and more durable.i dont own them but i do know that they are different now and actualy look 100% better.best buy has the new model if anyone is interested.
2,Not Worth the Money - Doesn't Cancel Noise Well,"I recently purchased this Philips Noise Canceling Headset, and paid $70 for it at Best Buy.This headset is NOT worth $70. It contains little or no foam padding, allowing large amounts of high-frequency noise to pass through. And in a quiet environment with no low-frequency noise (which is what the canceler is actually designed to cancel) there's actually a hissing noise, which is probably the result of impedance caused by poorly-designed electronics.I will admit, it does nicely block automobile engine noise and outside music while listening to another audio source (with the help of a small preamp, it sounds like).However, if you want something that effectively cancels noise, go with another brand. And I STRONGLY urge you to try on different types of noise-canceling headphones in a relatively noisy environment before you buy."
4,Philips Headphones,You get what you pay. It worth the money. First time I use it and cant hear wife nagging :) That alone worth 1000 bucks
1,disappointed!,"I had read several reviews, and I thought this product was the solution to my noisy office (air planes buzzing overhead, officemates chattering away, construction going on outside, etc.). I was so excited to have a device to turn my crappy office into my own personal place of tranquility. Boy was I wrong. The product did not reduce ANY noise. They functioned like an expensive set of headphones with no noise-cancelling abilities. I sent them back. My ear plugs did a better job than these headphones. Not sure if I got a defective product. Regardless, the thing didn't work for what I needed. I'm thinking ear plugs and ear muffs might do the trick at a fraction of the cost."
4,Excellent headphones - low price a plus,"I'm by no means an audiophile, but I fly cross-country nearly every month and have used these headphones reliably for the last five years. They fold up quickly and fit perfectly into the water bottle holder on my backpack. The noise-canceling feature is imperative for long flights and can make all the difference in drawing you completely into a show or letting you remember you're still stuck on a place. The wire that goes over the head got a little uncomfortable after 4 years of use, but there was nothing wrong with the headphones.Unfortunately, I left my beloved pair of these headphones on a JetBlue flight last week, so I'm on Amazon for a replacement. But even after reading reviews of the compeitors' offerings, I'm still sticking with these. Hello, Pair #2! I'll take better care of you this time, I promise."
2,Broke in less than a month,"I purchased these headphones to use at work because it is often difficult to concentrate with all of the phone conferences going on. They fold up quite well and look nice. They are comfortable and the sound is good, but the earpiece separated from the rest of it after only two uses.I am asking for my money back!"
4,A MUST song left out :(,"Excelent remastered quality compilation.Unfortunatly in this compilation there is an important song in Ata's career left out, a true 'Chant du monde' ""El Arriero va"""
2,too baggy,"I bought this seat cover for my car, and it the minute I put it on I was already regreting that I bought this. Its simply too baggy on the top and narrow down the middle. I would expect it to look like the picture on here because it said ""universal"" but it looks nothing like it, save your money and buy a quality 2 piece set."
4,Bruce,"When I was first looking into Classical music, I came across this gem. You get 9 of Beethoven's symphonies in a four CD set.The music is recorded well, and for the money it is a great deal."
3,"Complete, but....","This is indeed the most economical and yet complete collection of the ""canon"", but prbably for the sake of economy the quality of paper & printing have been severely compromised. Also, the font is very small and consequently makes the reading of these works a pain rather than a pleasure."
5,Orgasmic!,"I've had this book since my teenage years and it's the one book I go back to time and time again. I don't know what it is that makes me grab it from the bookshelf, perhaps Conan Doyle's unique style, his descriptions of old London or the Grimpen Mire or the small village deep in the home counties, the knee high fog settling on the moor,I just don't know!Watson's narration and Holmes deductions and logic never cease to thrill me and carry me away on an orgasmic journey of escapism. For that's what a good book does. That's what this book does."
2,Eh...,"Got the correct size and everything, just felt a little too snug for me. Might try a size bigger than normal if you do decide to order a pair."
5,Just what I wanted,Looking for cargo pants for my husband. He wanted pockets on the side for traveling so that he would not be sitting on his wallet for long periods. These are perfect.
