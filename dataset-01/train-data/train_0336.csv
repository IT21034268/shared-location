4,a great book,"Am reading library copy of this and trying it out walking. So far, my back aches less and this book really makes sense."
4,Chi walking,Excellent guide for walking whether you're a beginner or seasoned exerciser. A must read for anyone who loves to be outdoors!
4,good information,I bought this as a gift for my husband and he's been able to incorporate the information right away.
3,Chi Walking,"I only wish there were a CD to help with the pictures. I, as well as other senior citizens, had a hard time understanding the photos. Otherwise I am glad I purchased the book."
1,Long Winded Way to Say Nothing,Kept waiting for this book to tell me something useful. What a waste of time.
1,And the plastic keeps on coming,"When I ordered this item, I assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use. Actually, each flosser is a plastic prong with pre-strung floss in it, to be used once and discarded. Let me see: a million conscientious users floss daily and you have 365,000,000 plastic doodads added to the world's landfills every year. I already compromise my principles for convenience more than I'd like to admit. This is totally over the top. When I've used up my supply of flossers, out this thing goes. It goes into the landfill, to be sure. So don't anyone else make my mistake."
2,handle is not long enough for the Hummingbird flosser,"I did not like this product. The handle for this flosser short. I threw this away without even using the refills and went back to using my Reach flosser.Reach Access FlosserReach Access Flosser Refill Pack Disposable Snap-on Heads, Unflavored 28-count Packages (Pack of 2)Reach Access Flosser Cleanpaste Refill Disposable Snap-on Heads, 28-count Packages (Pack of 2)I also recently tried Glide disposable flossers and the floss broke too easily on those. I had to use up to 3 a day. I have found the Reach flosser to be the best so far as I have found."
3,Flooer Refills Review,"I have been using this product ever since my dentist recommended me. However, it seems that this product has been discontinued in Singapore. So I have to resort to buying online.Its a great product, the only thing I wish that it could be better is the durability of the flosser unit."
5,Finally a product that makes flossing easy !!,"The best flosser on the market period!!!!!!! Fits easily between teeth, the string does not break after flossing one tooth. I have used the flosser for several days and it still does not break."
1,Forget the Hummingbird - Reach for a manual flosser,"I bought this thinking it would be easier to use than a manual flosser, do a better job, or both. Was I disappointed. The floss is too loose to snap between your teeth, you have to constantly press the button to activate the motion (no true on/off switch), and it is too short. You have to have your hand in your mouth to use it on molars. I tried several times thinking I would eventually get the hang of it. Finally I gave up and went back to my manual Reach flosser. It's a much better product for half the price.Reach Access Daily Flosser Family Pack With 14 Refill Heads - 1 Each"
4,HUmming Right Along,"I like my Hummingbird Flosser, and online is the only place I can find these refill packs. Speedy delivery means I would deal with this vendor agaon."
2,So beautiful online . . but so ugly in real life!,"I was in the stores looking around and i saw this doll and other D.C dolls... I was shocked!!! The paint on their eyes' had fallen off, the hair was dry looking, they're really skinny and they look like they have too much mascara/eye shadow on! Overall, this is NOT something you want to get!! I would get the Raven doll! It is much pretiier!"
2,Barbies With Wigs On,"If you collect celebrity memorabilia and are looking for dolls that actually look like the girls in DC, you might want to pass on these.Of the three dolls, the one that most closely resembles her namesake is Beyonce. The other two literally look like the regular AA Barbies with different hairstyles and a lot more makeup.The dolls are all dressed very nicely, however.Going by looks alone, these dolls are as disappointing as the Catwoman doll that looked absolutely nothing like Halle Berry."
1,Shame!,"Beyonce should be insulted! This doll looks absolutely hideous with all that gunk on her face! Mattel has no excuse for making Beyonce look that way. Beyonce isn't on my favorite female artist list, but the girl is beautiful and this doll does her no justice. Mattel has a Black ""All That Glitters"" doll in its Diva Collection that looks more like Beyonce than this one does. Shame on you, Mattel!"
3,BEYONCE,"This doll is nice to add to your collection. The dress, hair, and makeup are nice. However, it's not one of the prettiest Barbies; the doll is not as pretty as Beyonce in real life. Diana Ross doll is much prettier. I collect Barbies; therefore, I have not taken her out of the box. The dolls comes with a poster and charm bracelet.I thought that they were going to sell Destiny's Child as a set. I bought Beyonce because I thought she would sell the fastest."
5,Perfect aid to study,This book allows a student of Hebrew language a wonderful opportunity to read Torah in Hebrew and follow along in transliterated English. The NIV is a reasonble format for basic study.
4,My child pottied the same day.,I was a little underwelmed by the production value but my girls loved it. They asked me to play it over and over. My two year old got up and pooped for the first time in the potty the same day. I have tried everything with this kid and a few times watching the video and it all clicked for her. I hope it works as well when my baby boy is ready to potty train. It has songs and a little girl hosts it. The kids love that. It even goes over how the toilet works and hand washing. It also has tips for parents too.
1,Not effective for 2 year olds.,"I'm glad I only paid a dollar for this from the dollar store! I've tried having my daughter watch it twice, and both times she didn't even watch it for even a minute. It did not catch my daughters attention or interest in using the potty."
1,not what i expected,"It feels like a ""home made"" video. I did not appreciate showing the potty chair being used as a toy, since young children immitate a lot and this could become a hygiene problem. My child was not interested in it what so ever. We watched it only one time and it has been resting on our shelf since then."
3,not for small kids,"I dont like how the little girl tells you a story throughout the whole movie, it dosnt work for a who year old. When the little boy plays pretend with his chair through the jungle, i think this kind of movie is for a child that has problems sitting on the chair, but we are pass that stage."
2,Good only for boys,"I had this video on VHS from when we potty trained my son. It had only images of a little boy using the potty, and I don't think that it would be good for my daughter. My question is, what is the difference between the VHS version and the DVD version that says that it is for Boys and Girls?"
2,Scared my daughter.....,I liked the video except that when the little boy who was potty training had a make believe journey into the jungle on a safari (on his toilet) there were horrible mean looking animals (i.e. crocodile staring into the camera snarling & snapping) that made my daughter burst out into tears and ran out of the room sobbing. Not the best thing to happen when I am trying to make potty training fun. She won't go near the potty again. If you have a boy who likes wild animals it would probably be okay ..... but for younger kids it can be scary....! ;-(
2,"Cheesy, even for a 2yr old.",This video is cheesier than Velveeta! It is painful to have to sit through it. Most of the video is of the little girl talking and not of the little boy actually on the potty. There is even a part where the little boy goes zooming around on the potty. Extremely painful viewing. I don't think my 2 year old son got anything at all from it.
4,Keeps his attention,"My son is just over 2 years old & watched this entire video. (That's saying a lot, since he is very active.) The little girl kept his attention and he listened closely as she talked. We had more success with the Potty Time With Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House) show, but this one peaked his interest and made him want to sit on his potty (in clothes)."
3,Good but not the best,It taught a lot but I needed something for a younger age child to watch and understand. It's more for a 3 or 4 year old or older child.
4,A lot of nice pictures,"This is a coffee-table book, and the main use of it is found in the numerous nice pictures of buildings and the landscape. The text by Blundell is useful but cannot take the place of scholarly works. The focus skips about a bit, and I do wish that the section on whiskey did not look so much like free advertising. The poetry section contains a number of typographical errors here and there. There are no examples of Scottish painting, even though it is a pictorial book."
4,It's A;ll Good,"I got curious about Kurt Nilsen after seing him on World Idol so I sampled some of his music on various sites and liked what I heard. I took the plunge and ordered his CD a couple of months ago. I'm so glad I did, in fact I have ordered another import that has an additional song. Kurt has the true soul of a rocker even though the album is more pop in flavor. His highly unusual voice reminds me somewhat of Neil Diamond. It's a shame that this artist has not been marketed in the US by the IDOL machine. A great CD but not really suitable for under 13s due to minor language and one sexual reference."
5,Best Idol Production,"This is really worth the price. The only disappointment is that the CD does not include ""It's A Beautiful Day"" cover that won Kurt the title. The CD is an excellent showcase that shows off Kurt's songwriting abilities. It has none of the ""manufactured"" feel that is symptomatic of the CDs produced for the American Idol winners and runners-up."
5,Love it but...........,"I love this CD but when you say their is 13 tracks on this CD (I germany), it should have 13 tracks not 12 tracks. I'm trying to get the CD that has Beauiful Day on it and i can't find it. Can someone help me. I need two copys. You can email me at graul65@hotmail.com ."
5,whoa...,"I saw and heard Kurt for the first time on World Idol in January 2004. When he belted out ""Beautiful Day"" my mouth dropped open, and my husband and I just gaped at each other in surprise. I could not believe this average-looking guy with a gap between his eyeteeth could have such a fantastic voice! That'll teach me to judge by looks. However, since that performance I have flipflopped in my attitude: hobbit or not, his VOICE and personality make him handsome to me. I was sick to death of hearing about Kelly Clarkson and her one-song-repertoire ""You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman"" which I hate (the girl isn't Aretha) and I was all for Kurt winning World Idol. Ever since then I've been a fan. It's too bad ""Beautiful Day"" isn't on Kurt's CD, but we'll wait for the next one. This CD is great...you won't be sorry!"
5,"What a talented, wonderful surprise!","My husband and I were blown away last year by Kurt's win on ""World Idol."" His rendition of U2's ""Beautiful Day"" is better than the original. He has a sweet yet rockin' voice that playfully pulls you in with his angst, his strong lyrics and unbelieveable voice. BUY THIS CD!!! It's been in constant rotation at our house for a year, and we are still diggin it. WHY ISN'T KURT IN THE MAINSTREAM? He's my favorite -- he'll be yours, too."
5,Buy His Album!,"From the moment I heard Kurt on WI I LOVED it!!! His voice is so beautiful. Kurt Nilsen voice is so mellifulous I melt into a puddle of tears and happiness. Kurt has established a new era of music. The songs express anger, love, hate, fear and all the emotions your familiar with. But doesn't every artist express feelings? Well, of course, but here we have an example of ""the real thing"".It feels like he's experienced every word and every phrase which leads to the fact you getting moved and captured like never before."
5,KURT NILSEN DESERVES THE WORLD IDOL TITLE,"Kurt's got an amazing voice. When I first downloaded Kurt Nilsen's rendition of ""Beautiful Day,"" I was thinking, ""I have to buy his CD."" I did and cannot stop listening to it.This guy can really sing. He's got the voice of an angel, like one of the Idol judges said. Simon Cowell is so wrong to say that he's a marketing challenge, there isn't any challenge at all to convince me that this guy is the best!I highly recommend this CD"
5,"Awesome , not to be missed!","This is an amazing debut album for this singer who really shocked and pleasantly surprised the world on World Idol. I was blown away by his performance and just had to get this album to experience more of his unique talent. Even my local radio station which loves to ridicule the American Idol show and the singers that come from it had nothing but praise for Kurt.Unlike many albums, there are no stinkers on this one. It's a nice mix of songs and does a great job of highlighting Kurt's voice. Yes, he does sound a bit like Bono from U2, but he definitely has his own unique feel and spin on these songs. This is a CD well worth getting, and I sure hope Kurt finds the international success he so much deserves...because I want to hear more from him!!"
2,Arrived rustic,The two curved bars arrived rustic (although they are wrapped in plastics). The plastic wrap of the bars also show signs of rustic residue. Although the rustic part will be connected with the horizontal bar and probably won't affect usage.
3,Pull ups??,What pull up bar? Still waiting for them to send the hardware even though it was supposed to be a Christmas present
5,A very simple excerise gym in-one.,I would recommend this to anyone trying to find the time to work out. it's simple to put together and it keeps you honest about your progress. The only thing is it's weight limitation. 250 pounds. I'm 200 pounds and after 3 weeks I'm up to 3 pullups and 20 pushups. a must have.
2,Great in theory- not so much in practice,"I was very excited to get this product- I wasn't even too discouraged that I had to put it together myself (I'm typically not very good with these things). But I was extremely disappointed when I found out it didn't fit my doorway. I realize I should have followed the measurement guidelines prior to purchasing, but I live in an apartment (standard everything) so I just figured it would work. NOTE TO OTHERS- MEASURE YOUR DOORWAY FIRST!After I got over that issue, I figured I could still use it for push ups and tricep dips. Great for about one rep when the cushioning stopped working and all I felt was metal bar driving into my palms. That was more uncomfortable than the actual workouts!I guess I'll still use it occasionally, but if given a second chance I probably wouldn't buy this."
5,AWESOME,This product is made strong and works the body in many ways. I like the way it is built. The bar is real strong. the grips are good quality and help the pull up experience better. The manual that comes with it can help built muscle and it helps alot.
2,will not fit all doors,"so i made the measurements, and the width will fit all my doors no problem. but there is also a height requirement on this that is not listed. i would recommend at least 2~3 inches above the door frame clearance. this is so that the top of the holder will be able to hold the top of the frame. unfortunately, this did not fit on my doors."
3,Decent,"Building it yourself is awful. Either I built it wrong or the parts were skewed, because the back part does not fit flush with the wall. Acceptable for the price, I guess. Also, the foam that is in contact with the door frame squeaks as you pull up."
1,very bad textbook,"Each chapter of that book deserves a book itself with detailed explanation/example on every term (and there are actually a lot of good books on each of the topic). Not sure what is the point to put everything in one book. I don't think that anybody who never heard about graphs/trees, difference equations, probability or algorithmic linear algebra could really understand/remember anything after going through this book."
4,Fun but not for everyone,"I bought this game because my wife and I both enjoy languages and etymologies and because the reviews here were glowing. However, we have found it difficult to play with friends who don't have a similar background in language because it is easier for us to fabricate plausible but false derivations and to detect the falsity of others' answers. There are non-derivation categories to mix it up a bit, but in the end things somewhat biased toward those with a rudimentary background in Latin and/or Greek.That being said, I do enjoy the game."
5,Staid Demeanor Lost,"The game Derivation is about the greatest combo of fun and learning ever created!!! Being a single parent, starting an embroidery company and now newly retired teacher I have always had to have every minute of my life count for ten. Therefore a night spent ""playing"" was unthinkable. But..... if we're learning something like etymology .... then that could be worth while. Last night I borrowed it from him to play with a sub group of my Christian Singles organization. Well, you can imagine the rest of the story!!! Many times our ""intellectual"" responses reduced all of us to uncontrollable laughter. The word staid certainly dropped from our demeanor! Each of them, plus others who have already heard of our ruckus Saturday night, now want to buy it too! Again, mahalo for using your talents to make the world a better place! Carol Ann Rinker"
2,Desktop Publishing?,"Far from complete (or even compleat), this work is a cursory treatment of meadmaking which appears from the unfocused writing style and grammar errors to have been self-published. Although it seems on first glance to have many recipes, there are actually only about a dozen: the rest are only minor variations on a theme. Most of the book is devoted to lengthy discussions about various fruits and spices, many entirely unrelated to mead. In more than one location, a whole section ends with the confession ""how this applies to mead is unclear."" If you want to know what raspberries and basil are, go ahead and get this book. If you want to know how to make mead, don't bother. Chas. Papazian has more useful instruction in one chapter of his book than you'll find in this entire work. And he had an editor. Alas, this is neither a comprehensive work nor even a useful resource."
4,Good info source,Just as good as all my other resources with some good new info. Great price for a good book to add to your library.
3,Mead making,"Although this book is excellent on instructions and all the things you need to know about mead making, it is very short on the recipe side. I was disappointed with this part. Still a good book, but definitely not for someone looking for recipes."
4,A perfect gift for a perfect niece,I purchased this book for my niece who is majoring in mideval wine and spiritmaking. She is very taken with the book and wants to try the recipes. Maybe I'll get some homemade mead for Christmas!
3,Does the job,Good enough for my needs (setting up my bass guitar). Numbers are faded but legible. Does need a lot of cleaning before use coz it was very greasy.
5,Good quality at a great price!!!!,Nice gauges at a great price. Well made and I expect them to last. I bought these to use to set up guitars which they work great for. All in alll a great deal!!!!
4,"Really nice feeler gage, but units are a bit too thin","I actually bought these for spark plug gap measurements, but the units provided was way too thin. What i did was stack them, and add up the blades thickness. Dont buy these for spark plug gap measurements. Great feeler blades, but not for spark plugs!And the oil isn't a problem people.... haha It's just a simple matter of wiping it off with a paper towel.....haha would have been 5 stars, but i didnt really read the fine print.... haha"
4,"Good, just one problem..","I bought this to use for my guitar when I adjust the truss rod; it is working perfectly for that! The only thing is that the blades are covered in oil! I tried wiping and washing the blades numerous times, but there is still some oil on them that I just can't get off. I'm sure there is a good reason for the oil, but I find it annoying and it may annoy other people too. Overall it's a good product for the price, and I would buy it again."
2,China built...and it shows,Very greasy right out of the package. I doubt I'll be able to get this calibrated by a professional shop.
2,Good price... poor quality.,"Great price! Quality, not so great.The clasp holding the gauges together fell apart after about a month. Also, when I received the set, all of the gauges were greasy and filmy - almost pre-oiled! Ended up buying a better quality set from Pep Boys."
4,Almost big enough,The thickest one was 0.005 too narrow for my valve specifications but that's ok I was able to make do. Perhaps I should have read the description better.
4,Nice Tool,Recommend by colleague. Can disassembled the thing and put the gauges one wants on the outside. Nice quality metal. Good product. They even oil it before the put it into the package so it won't rust. Very nice.
4,Another good Rocky Lane flick,"Rocky's perennial antagonist Roy Barcroft is absent from this picture, but Jim Nolan does just fine as the title character who ""sells"" government land to settlers and has his gang ambush them for their money as they arrive. Rocky rescues one such couple (Harry Lauter and Helen Stanley) and the husband's older lawman father (John Hamilton) and, with the help of crumugeoney jewelsmith Nuggett Clark (regular sidekick Eddie Waller), begins unraveling the scheme. Scripter Olive Cooper provides a slam-bang story with a lively and diverse cast of characters."
4,An important edition to the study of Islamic history and culture,"This book covers the history of Yemen under the Egyptian Ayyubids (those of Salahuddin) and Rasulids, their administration of the country and the social climate of the country. Make sure you get the 2 volumes as volume one is the Arabic edition and volume 2 the English translation (that is of course unless you speak Arabic!)"
3,Looks great....at first.,"This carbon fiber hitch-cover looked great when I first purchased it (got tons of compliments)! Now, however, (2 months later) the emblems carbon fiber layer is chipping off :(. Great-item if you're looking for a short-term investment."
3,not bad if you like booty songs,not the best song out there but guaranteed to make the ladies shake their tailfeathers.
1,A new sound for the generation,"I thought P.diddy's lyrics were so moving,I felt an emotional connection with Nelly when he says ohhhh ohhh ohhhh on the start of the song.I truly belive 40 years from now this song will still be buzzing on our airwaves, like the sound of bees right before they sting you.I appreciate the fact that they put so much effort into the music.I love how P.diddy is not in this for the money.So thanks P.diddy for hypnotizing music listeners with your sold-out so called raps. Thank you for going up to Hip-Hop and smacking it across the face. If you want to hear some good rap go buy The Beastie Boys or Jurassic Five."
3,Universal Rack,"This is a good light weight tray, I am not fond of the system to install it with but it does work and I am changing my tray attachment system so it is easier to install. It does work as advertised and I like it. I might go for a little larger on next time but then you have to becareful not to overload your rack system.All in All good product well made, directions a little weak."
4,Jonatha Brooke,"Have to say I hated the movie, but when the song 'I'll Try' played, I immediately recognized the amazing talent of Jonatha Brooke. It is a beautiful song and if you enjoy it, I highly recommend you listen to her other stuff. She has several solo albums, all of which are good, but her best work (in my opinion)is the stuff she did as part of a Boston based duo called 'The Story'. Their album 'Grace in Gravity', is one of my all time favorites. The harmonies on the album are astounding and complex. Jonatha has a penchant for minor keys and her phrasing is unmistakeable. Superb stuff for the music enthusiast."
3,Jonatha Brooke Makes This CD Something Magical,"The only reason I purchased this CD is because of Jonatha Brooke. I'm a huge supporter of this very talented artist. She sings ""Second Star To the Right"" from the original, and wrote and performs ""I'll Try"", a beautiful song that reoccurs throughout the film and the end credits. The New York Time reviewed this film on 2/15 and mentioned this song as ""One of the sturdiest to grace a Disney film."" This could easily be an oscar-nominated song.The rest of the CD is beautifully orchestrated, containing the score of the film. Brooke, however, makes the CD something special."
5,"""I'll Try""","The movie was okay, but the song ""I'll Try"" just made me want to see it again and again. It's so great!! I love it!!"
5,The Release of the Spirit,Great Book the best I have ever read on the Holy Spirit. It was so easy to read and understand. It is one I will have to read over and over. There is just so much wonderful information to apply and enjoy in my life that I did not understand before. The book was exactly like it was supposed to be. Shipped and delivered just like requested. I am sitting at the computer to order again.
3,Read at least Once,"I read this book about 1971 when I was attending an evangelical Christian college. I purchased a copy about eight years ago to give to a Christian woman whom I thought would benefit from it. I was not too surprised that she returned it without reading it from cover to cover. Some of the concepts were probably just too hard for her to understand.""Except a kernel of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but if it die it springeth forth bringing much fruit."" Not an exact quote of the KJV, but that is the principle of the book: brokenness brings forth lasting fruit.This book is probably not for just Christians. Others who go through trials and tribulations can equally engage the Spirit of the Divine through the crucible of human suffering, both their own and that of those around them. It is what makes us human."
2,The Spiritual man- condensed,"After discovering Watchman Nee's writings i felt as if i found a kindred spirit. I begin buying his books and while they are very, deep and yet very repititious they are spiritual food for thought and challenging to every believer's discernment. I agree with most of his beliefs but he can get too contradictng and overkilling and lose many readers with his writings as if he keeps saying the same thing over and over.Actually most of his books carry the same core message (about the spirit)and are now packaged with different titles so it is easy to buy a duplicated book under a similar title. This book is easily covered under the book he has titled The Spiritual Man."
2,hiss,"I purchased this recorder to record voice only. I will use these tapes to record and listen to auto-suggestions during self-hypnosis. I found the machine easy to use but the noise recorded from, apparently, the machine itself is so distracting that it is not usable. In other words it self creates and records noise. During playback while I am speaking it is just barely acceptable. During pauses in speaking it is noisy and distracting to the point of irritation. I would have been willing to pay more for a recorder for this use but it was the only one available at the store I was in. Now I am searching for a machine with better quality audio. In the future I am sure I will switch to digital but tape is most functional for me at this point in time..."
5,GE 35369 Mini Cassette Recorder,All my recordings were very clear and help me a lot in learning my songs. I was very please with the product.
1,Quite a dissapointment,"I just recently bought one of these recorders, and it barely works at all. The first time I used it during an interview, the recorder only picked up ten or fifteen seconds of talking, and the rest was a high-pitched squealing noise that resembled a fire alarm. I'm returning it as soon as possible. Maybe this was just a bad recorder, but I'm not going to take my chances with a new one."
2,Only if you have time to spend,"After two years using this IPAQ and long experience with PDA's I can surely say that it is one of the most disappointing products I've ever bought. The 2755 has excellent features but needs time to think what to do and where to go....Imagine you are in your car and you receive an urgent call from your boss asking for a phone number, it is urgent. You open your 2755 and while you wait to get to the first screen you can tell your boss to play a complete tennis set.I had to erase software from my handheld to make it faster. The 1 gb card didn't help much. I'm moving to an Axim and hope for better luck."
2,Battery Drain Flaw,"Overall, great product with one major flaw. I have used this unit for 3 weeks and have experienced the following: It turns itself on for no apparent reason and drains the battery. If you are a frequent business traveler, this is a nightmare! I have been using PDA's for many years. This unit has great features, but this flaw is a big concern. HP says to hard re-set the unit. This requires you to re-load all of your settings and programs. Well, when you prefer to use this unit on the road instead of your laptop, you are out of luck. HP - Please fix this issue! Than I would rate it a ""5"" star unit."
2,NIce - when it works,"Turns itself on for no reason at times -- very frustrating when you go to use it and find the battery is dead. Soft reset is something you will do regularly -- especially three to five times after synchronization. I would definitely not buy an HP handheld again at this point.And, yes, I upgraded software, firmware, and synchronization software. Nothing changed. And, in hopes a new operating system and other upgrades would fix the problems, I let the one year warranty expire. That was a mistake. My previous Palm device was wholly reliable."
4,Overall Quality Release from Bailterspace,"Although some of the songs are long winded and drone on a bit, this album has a few tracks that really stand out. ""Zero Return"" has a real haunting kind of melody to it. ""Fish Eye"" is good, too. ""Skin"" just blows me away. It rocks as hard as anything I've ever heard from Bailterspace. I can just listen to that one track over and over again. Their sound is good on this release, too. Overall, if you like Bailterspace this is worth having. If you are just getting into them I would try Vortura first."
4,Almost a five,"This is an excellent presentation, as these things go. Ratings for these always should come down to two key points: 1) quality of the models and 2) what those models show the viewer.Well, you kind of have to hold your breath through the first three girls (of the eight) before you get to the best ones. A big positive is that there aren't many breast implants here (one blonde woman is SPECTACULAR). Minor points off for the first few girls.Minor points off because the ladies don't reveal enough as often as the typical viewer of this fare is going to want to see. ""It"" is there to be seen in most cases, but is fleeting and somewhat incidental.I do agree to some extent with the reviewer who said that the models don't really seem as into this as we really would like for them to be. Nothing like a CandyGirl DVD for instance. So, minor points off for that.But that still leaves us with a four, which is darn good. Kudos also for the uncensored trailers in the bonus section."
2,Somebody had to make the dullest Brahms Fourth on record,"Wolfgang Sawallisch can be a proficient conductor who sincerely represents the old Kapellmeister tradition, but why EMI has stood behind him for fifty years is a total mystery. This Brahms Fourth with the London Phil. starts off slow and slack and never changes course. There isn't a bar that sounds inspired and many that sound fatigued. The filler, a mellifluous account of the Schicksalslied, is pleasant without being anything special. If only EMI had thrown their immense resources behind the long list of better condcutors who enjoyed nothing like Sawallisch's privilege: Horenstein, Leibowitz, and Scherchen can begin the list."
5,Stunning,"This album was recorded at the height of Trane's ""sheets of sound"" period. The opener, Black Pearls, starts off as a fairly typical hard bop tune in a standard A A B A form. However, shortly after Trane starts his solo his genius becomes apparent. Trane's solo is a miracle of light and sound. He furiously attacks the tune with an unbelievable ferocity. He spins long lines that are rhythmically and harmonically incredible. I can only imagine Byrd and Garland trying to follow him, slack-jawed in amazement.After Trane, Byrd collects himself and actually turns in a nice solo that contrasts nicely with Trane's fire-breathing one. His lines are laid back but sufficiently exploratory.Lover Come back to Me is a fast tempoed tune that is ok and Sweet Saphire Blues features Garland on an extended solo turn. Overall though, Trane's transcendent performance on ""Pearls"" alone is worth the price of the cd."
1,Be careful,"Sorry to rate this so low, but I'm rating the entire buying experience rather than the quality of the product itself. I bought this item because I own a Black and Decker 3/8 drill that is over 30 years old and still working fine, but I lost the chuck key. The reason I title this ""be careful"" has to do, I guess, with the ""pilot"" size. I wrongly assumed this would fit any B&D 3/8 drill. Okay, my error. But i buy from Amazon because they cover my errors. Not so with this item. When I went to the return area, there was no option for either return or exchange. So, I'm stuck with it, I guess. If you want one and can figure out how to cover the shipping, you can have this one. But right now, I'm hatin it."
3,One viewing is enough,"Not sure what all the fuss is about Norah Jones! I rented this DVD after listening to her album a few times and feel that one viewing is enough (as another reviewer also stated). She comes across very nervous on stage, and there is very little talking from her. There are some added bonuses on the DVD including ""Tennessee Waltz"". Now, I really love this song - but no-one does it quite like Eva Cassidy."
2,"Great singer, not so good live performer","I really liked Norah Jones's CD so I purchased the DVD. During the concert Norah did not smile often, had little connection with the audience, had virtually no chit-chat or humor. In other words, the DVD lacks excitement and vitality. A review in the Star Tribune of her recent Minneapolis concert made similar comments. I chose to not purchase tickets to this concert because of the DVD."
2,not as good as the real thing,I attended the NewOrleans concert and it was so much fun to be there in person. This dvd is good but severley edited - and it definitly dosn't match up to the magic of seeing Norah and her band perform live!
2,The Brutal Vigor of Snorah Jones.,"She's just as boring as ever in this new DVD. Granted, it's somewhat a testament to her talent, as she is able to smoothly lull listeners to sleep live just as well as on CD. But the material is just as flat and the style is just as draining. The most impressive thing about it is the fact that the soundman's mixes didn't have to be altered at all in the transfer to a market-ready product. Now that takes talent."
3,Norah looks nervous...,"I loved Norah's CD, but she looks and acts so nervous here (in between numbers) that I found it distracting. As another reviewer commented, give the woman a towel... The DVD's 5.1 sound was excellent, the musicianship was as extraordinary as her CD--except for her guitarist, whose instrument was out of tune."
1,Norah Jones - Live in New Orleans,"Poor sound mix. instruments same volume as vocals. Vocals get lost and are hard to stand out thru the music. Its like listening to the music in a tunnel with very poor accoustics. Hopefully I can find a better sounding Norah Jones DVD since this one sounds so bad. But based on the ratings this one has I would question if we have the same DVD. We do, yet the average rating is four out of five for a DVD with this poor of accoustics."
1,Want to fall asleep?,"Buy this or any Norah Jones CD! Incredibly overrated voice and songs, Norah has been able to sell records because people think she's a breath of fresh air when, in fact, she's as boring as they come. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ."
2,Stick With The CD,"Although young and pretty so she's nice to look at, this is another example of a DVD that really is a waste if you already own the CD with the same music. Norah is so young she really isn't much of a performer, nervous when she talks or tries to ad-lib anything.Thus, after the first viewing, this isn't much more than a glorified CD. Neither her nor the drummer or guitarist in the small jazz combo are flashy enough to bring notice. In other words, none of the musicians are animated nor is there any noteworthy camera-work. It's mainly straight-on shots of Nora singing and playing the piano.It's nice music and she has a calming, smooth voice but don't waste your money on this. Stick with the CD."
3,"Early Norah, just okay","2002-Norah doing what Norah does. Have seen her show twice last year. She is exciting on stage, but this video is not the most creative presentation of this fine entertainer. She is seen as young, talented, sweaty. Not the same band she performs with regularly now, Catch her live for the real experience."
5,Jazeps,"this is the best video (from two 2003 year dvd and 2004 year dvd) - because there are all the best hits, ""come away with me"" and others, and the video is teken by good taste (good video operator and editor work), it is pleasure to watch, not like dvd from 2004 year. the bad thing is that both video are in very poor quality, video compresion makes it impossible to get good sight when loked on big tv, or projected on the wall.sory for my weak english:)"
3,Protect your steam engine smoke chest use the product,"Satisfied with product delivery, condition of the product upon arrival. It is a needed product for proper maintenance of the steam chest electric powered steam producing mechanism. This product adds some realism and action to O guage 3 rail electric steam engine operation."
5,Therapist #1 pick,"Love this book. For a parent it can put you back on track in no time. It's short and concise. ""Say this. Don't say that."" You'll enjoy his first book ""Back in Control"" as well."
1,What a Joke!,"This text is not meant for parents who truly need assistance. The author has a clear distain for the mental health profession and other professions designed to assist families in crisis. He offered no clear directives in how to address problem behavior, only to suggest the parents use structure, discipline, and love. This author clearly misses the mark for families who have provided these items to these children and the children are still ""out-of-control"". My guess is the author has not experienced the issue personally nor does he have children. Don't waste your time or money on this text, there are better ones out there."
5,great album,"everyone should buy this album, it is jam packed with infectious beats and east 17 type sounds. flip reverse has a foot stomping chorus and is a very dancey track that wouldnt be out of place on a justin timberlake album.Also 'we just be dreamin' and 'thinkin about you' sound like the old boyband 'five' songs. which are also very good songs. I recommend this album to all fans of rap/garage/hip hop and flavours of rnb.purchase a copy at once at Amazon.my top 5 songs on the album1. no angels2. we just be dreamin3. thinkin about you4. flip reverse5. revolution"
2,Not what it says!,"Coleman claims this to be a dual-chamber air mattress with both sides independently controlled. However, it fills and deflates both sides together, and only allows a very small deviation between the firmness one partner selects versus the person on the other side. When one person presses ""firm"" for his side--yes, the male is usually the bigger person needing more air to deflect his weight--the woman on the other side feels her side inflate, too. When I (a 100-pound woman) tried to press ""soft"" to make my side respond to my lower weight, my husband's side also lost air. So we could never get it comfortable for either of us as the manufacturer claims it will do because the chambers are still very much connected. Customers are able to only control the difference in the two sides to a slight degree. Otherwise, it pumps up and deflates quickly, like any good air mattress with attached pump should. It also has a much nicer pillow top pad than the flocking found on most beds of this type."
1,For your amusement!,"Most of this album is just fine and shows Maria Callas in typical form. I'm not a huge fan of her voice, but I do appreciate her artistry and acting. But, the Wagner Liebestod IN ITALIAIN is just too much. It makes me laugh out loud every time I hear it. It's worth the price just for the amusement value."
5,A collection way overdue,"This one's a beauty...not only are these carefully selected high points of the Callas career, the mastering and production is meticulous. The lineup of conductors is impressive, too--these guys were among the best of their time and their contributions go quite some way beyond mere accompaniment. Simonetto, in particular, was incapable of giving a lousy performance.In spite of some screechy bleakness here and there, Callas during this period redefined what ""coloratura-lyric"" means."
2,But the others were so good...,"I have read all the Harry Potter books and have seen all and own most of the movies. This one is just the second in a disturbing trend started in The Order of the Phoenix.Some of the best Tom Riddle's best memories are left out of this one. Harry's inheritance of Sirius Black's home and house elf, an important part of understanding Regulis Black, is also left out. Voldemort's own maternal and paternal histories, as well of what he thought of his mother has been left out. There are so many things left out of this movie that made J.K. Rowling's book so good that I think as fans, we should demand a redo!!!The one bright spot in this movie, however, is Alan Rickman (Snape). In his face you could see his concern for all of the students involved in the inner circles of Voldemort and Dumbledore."
3,???,"I am so confused! What is this thing - it's in a blu-ray box, but I didn't want a blu-ray disk. I wanted a DVD. The description says that it's a blu-ray/DVD combo. So is it both? It is a Christmas present for someone who doesn't have a blu-ray player. I have bought other DVD's lately that came with a free blu-ray disk just in case you decide to upgrade. I though this was one of those, but now I'm not sure. I don't want to open the box. Can someone tell me what's in the box?"
2,Harry Potter and The Half Blood-Crappy-Movie,"ALAS! After two years of waiting for the sixth installment of the H.P. series, the Warner Corporation presents us with a lame, unsatisfying, boring and highly dissapointing movie. I second all the previous reviews, like the one from J.R. among others, who have appropriately pinpointed the flaws in this ghastly film. Come on!! They totally left out (or changed) crucial parts of the book, like the war in Hogwarts against the Death Eaters, Dumbledore's funeral, vital info about the Horcruxes, Tom Riddle's past, etc, etc, etc. Never mind, I will not repeat what others have already described in such an accurate way about the reasons why I shall only rate this movie with two stars. How frustrating and dissapointing, indeed! They've shattered all my healthy expectations about it. I expected much better from this film, after all, it is supposed to be based on the excellent written version of the Half Blood Prince."
3,Disk quality not so good,"The entire movie appeared uncomfortably dark, even in the indoor scenes. I don't recall Horgwarts School being so ill-lit in the previous movies, and it was not so when I saw it in the movie theatre. viewing this DVD at home, looked like the entire movie was shot at night."
4,"Harry Potter, need I say more",This movie tried to fit the whole book in and it does a pretty good job
3,Harry Potter all the way,Being a fan of the books it's hard to fully appreciate the movie adaptations. I love Harry Potter through and through but this movie seemed to be more focused on romance rather than the rise of Voldemort. But it's still Harry Potter and I will always be a devoted fan. For people who haven't read the books this movie will be quite enjoyable!
3,Harry P & the Half-Blood Prince..,"If you are a fan of Harry Potter, then this movie will continue your love of Potterworld. If you have not been keeping up with Harry's exploits, this is not the movie to introduce you to his world. It feels like the middle of the story. I realize that this is basically a ""middle story"" in the books, but if you are new to Potterworld then you would not want to start with this movie. It begins almost exactly where the last movie ended; It might be a good idea to watch 'Order of the Phoenix' before watching this movie to avoid feeling a bit lost at the beginnning as I did. The story carries on and the end leaves you feeling as if it were unfinished; not really reaching its own resolution but merely a breathing point before taking off on the next HP adventure.The effects were enjoyable and the story was good.The dvd itself was not packaged very well and the case was cracked when it arrived."
5,Half Blood Prince Blu-ray,"Even this ""darker film"" looks better in blu-ray. The Wizarding and Cave scenes are awesome!"
4,Missing #12 Albus Dumbledore,On the outside of the package it said that it included Limited Edition Character Cards: #11 Draco Malfoy & #12 Albus DumbledoreI received two Draco Malfoy cards instead.Everything else was there I am just missing my #12 Albus Dumbledore card/
4,Not as Good as the Book,"...but most movies aren't. This was, however, a very entertaining movie! It's interesting to see the characters getting older. This movie is quite a bit darker than the previous Harry Potter movies, and fight against Voldemort *gasp* has become more urgent and more real. All in all, this was a well done movie and a good addition to the Harry Potter series."
5,Great Movie For Harry Potter Fans!,I liked it because I like the Harry Potter series and I enjoyed watching a movie after reading the book.
4,"Good movie, good story, similar to Lord of the Rings.","I personally prefer Lord of the Rings. Harry potter for the younger crowed. But after this film, a little more interesting."
3,HP & the Half-blood Prince,Love these Movies Ive been holding out for this Disc at a decent Price & am so glad to own it WE have a 2 year old so havent got a chance to watch it but will soon hopfully As per the Movie I think it was seriously lacking just like so many of the Movies in this Series
4,interesting harry potter book,What can i say about this. Is good. Entertaining. A bit childish. But adults will like it no matter what just because it has a good story. So check it out!!!!!!!!!!
2,doesn't bring spanish language,"Hi, those who wants this movie in spanish language, don't buy it, because the description said that have it, and it doesn't . My family loves the movies of Harry Potter but not everybody understand english, so they will not enjoy this movie"
3,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Privce,"Very dark movie. Geez, did Hogwarts go ""Green"" and quit using electricity or something. The whole thing has a dark and ha a despairing atmosphere. Nothing funny or fun about the movie. There is no PigWidgeon the little Owl Sirus had left Ron there is so much missing. As I remember in the book Dumbledore hit Harry with a spell that petrified him when Snape was going to kill him because he knew Harry would come to his aide. Not this time. This time Harry was hiding behind a chair. Did not like the Movie and from the reviews above mine I think I will wait for the Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 to go down to a penny before I ever buy them. If you haven't read the books you will probably like it if you have and are a fan you won't I can guarantee that."
3,Didn't do the book justice,"For a book as detailed as HBP, putting it into a 2 hour and 30 minute movie did not do it justice. I would have preferred it to be split into two movies without loss of the storyline rather than cramming it into one movie. Although I did enjoy the movie, mainly because I read the book, those who've only seen the previous movies without reading the book will be totally lost. The first time I saw HBP was in a hotel and closed-captioning was not available. I barely understood the dialogue and had a hard time seeing what was going on due to the darkness of this movie. Of course it's much more enjoyable on Blu-ray but I'm hoping the final movies won't have this issue. For true Potter fans, two movies will be worth watching because it will stay true to the book."
3,Disappointed,"Although the movie did follow the book, much of the story line was omitted. It ended up being a confusing movie that did not flow from one scene to the next but wandered with little purpose. Disappointing!"
2,Painful to watch,"This movie is painful to watch. There are many more flaws than even Geoff (another reviewer) points out in his review. I get irritated just by watching it. I thought the first movie was brilliant in every way. The second was very good. Beginning with Azkaban, the movies have gone downhill. I think Michael Gambon, while a fine actor, is horribly miscast as Dumbledore. Where's his twinkling eyes? Where's his mouth twiching when he's amused and trying not to show it? Albus Dumbledore, as we know him in the books, has an almost child-like sense of humor and wonder. Gambon lacks these qualities entirely. The dialogue is terrible. There's almost zero continuity in the film. I agree with Geoff . . this movie is only very loosely based on the book. I bought the DVD because I'm a Harry Potter fanatic and must have all the movies, but I am deeply disappointed."
3,would have been better as tv series,harry potter is a great series that i love with all my heart. but these movies aren't doing it justice. every time i watch this movie i cringe the majority of the most magical elements have been left out. no longer do you see ghosts floating the halls and never have we even been subject to peeves the poltergeists annoying antics. two hours is jut not enough time to fit it all in. this is why i hold the belief that harry potter should be made into a tv show where the books can be played out in all their marvelous glory.
2,Doesn't download for the iPad,I rented this movie to watch on the airplane on my iPad. Disappointed to find that a download option wasn't available. No wifi on the plane so a wasted purchase. Amazon needs to have a better notification on instant rental limitations.
5,Dark and beautiful,"Rabid fans of the novel will be disappointed at what's left out - for everyone else, this is probably the best of the Potter movies so far...fantastic art direction and cinematography, that help build up the sense that unstoppable Darkness is approaching Hogwarts... wonderfully poignant glimpses of the Hogwarts kids as teenagers who may be great at magic but don't know what to do with their hormones... though this episode is one last stop, before the two-part finale, it's deeply satisfying in its own right, as we see the wrenching end of the beloved characters' innocence -the last dark glimpse of Hogwarts before the Beginning of the End."
1,No digital copy?,"Just received the ""Digital Copy Special Edition"", and went to download the Digital Copy and found that it is only compatible with Windblows. What the ...!? I bought this so-called special edition so as to get the DC, and now I can't because I have a Mac? NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!"
2,A Disgrace to the Harry Potter series,"I am so disappointed in this last installment that I can't properly say here. I thought that the last one was bad, but this takes the cake. I can't for life of me understand why the writer would allow someone to destroy her work like this. What in heavens name is the point of putting in stuff that don't even happen and leaving out pertinent parts. I can hardly wait to see how they destroy Deathly Hallows. I am so disappointed, the books were SOOOOO good and the movies started out good, Does anyone know what happened to the original Dumbledore and the original director? It is just such a let down."
5,Harry Potter Half blood prince,I am very excited to watch this movie. Because it is very fun to watch on tv. I would like to buy this movie without Blu-ray. I just want one disc of the dvd with full screen edition on it also.
2,Not Good.,"I was looking forward to this movie despite the previous one being terrible. When the movie was over I got the impression they were more worried about who wants to go out with who and then had periodic flashes of ""Oh yeah, evil guy wants to kill us.""This movie could have been better and toned down on the love stuff, there at war not on a dating game. I hope Deathly Hollows is better because right now the best one so far is ""Goblet of Fire.""So if you a Potter Fan, rent before you buy!"
1,Don't bother with the Digital Copy,"If you're buying this to get the digital copy, don't bother. It only works on Microsoft PlaysForSure (PlaysForMaybe?) devices, of which Microsoft's own media player, the Zune, isn't even one. Seriously, Microsoft's OWN device does not support PlaysForSure. Are there even any PlaysForSure devices? If there are, they are older things like the SanDisk Sansa, or other really lame players. DRM is bad, but broken DRM that isn't even supported by the company that made it is worse. I will tell you OneThingForSure - you won't get this digital copy to play on anything. Don't bother."
3,Unexpected,"This is my first Blu-ray Hp film. I ordered this movie because I wanted the DVD disc as the extra. Amazon shows this product as a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack, but i only received a 2-Disc Blu-ray version of the film. What's up with that?????"
1,"Fine film, horrible product from Warner Brothers","This is a negative review of Warner Brothers - and the digital product that I purchased. This is not a review of the movie.I purchased the Blu-Ray, DVD + Digital copy version. Somewhere on the back of the cardboard sleve that came with the case, are some tiny words that tell you the Digital Copy expires on May 7, 2010. On the front of the package are giant words: ""Combo Pack includes Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy"". Who reads all the fine print on the back prior to purchase?Expiration date? Fine print? I had intended to wait until I purchased a new computer with a larger hard drive to download the movie (my iTunes folder is getting really big). Why would Warner Brothers behave so poorly? I had no reason to dislike WB until now. I feel cheated and ripped off. I will forever feel hestitant to purchase anything from WB ever again. Buyer beware!"
1,Dude its one of the boring movie ever !,I use to like Harry Potter series when it first came out but now its all boring to me .
3,Harry Potter-Half blood or half movie??,The movie was dissapointing because it came to no conclusion. I realize that this is a series but this movie appeared to be half a movie with the end looking much like an intermission. It would have been nice to have some sort of conclusion drawn lke the previous.
4,Thankfully there's extras!,"An upsetting trend has begun to develop with recently released DVDs, being that they don't have any special features unless you buy the Blu-Ray version. But Happily, this 2disc edition has a good selection of special features and thankfully they've dropped the annoying voice over that was on DVD's of the older Harry Potter movies. My only complaint would be that there is no commentary! Other than that, I'm satisfied with this DVD."
1,Endless Comercials and Previews,"15 minutes after we plugged in the DVD, we've finished our dinner, and the DVD STILL won't let us fast forward or go to the start menu. We're all so ticked off that it's no use watching this piece any longer. After some 10 minutes of childish video game commercials (even for Harry Potter fans) then the previews start for movies and THEN even more commercial for silly video games. It's STILL going as I'm typing this. It's absolutely USELESS!!"
3,No special features,"If you are looking for the special features, deleted scenes, etc, do not buy this version of the movie. It consist of only the following:1. 45 minutes or more of advertising for Harry Potter stuff and other movies which starts playing as soon as you insert the disk2. The main movie itselfThat's it. No special features. They used the space on the disk for advertising instead."
3,Not a faithful adaptation,"I have to be honest, no matter how much I try to like this movie adaptation of the book I feel so much is missing. There was no meeting with the prime minister in the beginning that I thought made the book so funny. Tom Riddle's story as a child wasn't explained well enough. There was no battle at the school leading up to Dumbledore being confronted by Malfoy. Overall, I was disappointed. This movie is the most faithless adaptation of all the six movies released so far. I would recommend you borrow the movie first before you buy it."
1,Bad.. bad.. bad,"I Love the book... hate this movie... poor story, poor everything... The Battle of Hogwarts, one of the most important and epic events in the Harry Potter story, where is in the movie?, nobody knows. And this is just an example..."
1,Major disappointment.,"Production Values:I don't know if it was purposefully photographed so darkly that very little could be seen and that little was colorless/lifeless or if it was as another reviewer wrote a copy of a copy of a copy, but it was bad.The Movie:Marginally better than its production values, disjointed, boring and really didn't go anywhere. Have them all, wish I hadn't bought this one and won't be buying the next (if there is one)."
3,ok but...,"Just disappointed that they missed the best part of the book, the fight between the Hogwarts professors and the death eaters."
3,Not always by the book,"I did like the movie however it wasn't as good as i expected. Even though it wasn't a 90 minute movie it still felt short; again they've turned a book into a movie and left out so much information and interesting parts that the readers expected. I still enjoyed the movie and I'm still a fan, especially when you see the actors grow mentally and physically in front of you. Maybe the problem is also that i feel it's taking so long to do all the stories, while reading them only takes a matter of weeks or months(depending on what kind of reader you are).Because I'm still a fan and i still liked the movie I give it 3.5 stars;higher if it were longer and truer to the book. Still watchable and worthy of adding to the collection."
5,Brilliant!,"My first copy sent was 'lost in shipment' so they sent another right away. I didn't get it when I wanted (1 day after the movie was released to DVD) but the quick service was nice.I definitely like the darker tone set in this movie. Don't misunderstand, the first five are excellent, but this movie has the visuals I was waiting for. I am even more anxiously awaiting the last installment coming in July'10 and November '11."
4,Buy it!,"I have been a fan of Harry Potter since the first book was released. I simply love the way JK Rowlings weaves the story through the years, adding characters & enhancing the story as she goes. The movies have done an amazing job of staying to the story line though it would be impossible to cover all of the details. This edition, is simply wonderful. I enjoy the maturing aspect of the characters and the addition of many of the historical details from the written versions. I know I am biased but that is my opinion!"
3,"good movie, but...","Bought this as a gift and could not get the 1st blu-ray disc 1 to work in my blu-ray machine. So I exchanged for a new one, since all my other blu-ray movies work just fine. The replacement didn't work as well. I have a samsung player (have to look up the model number), but noticed that some of the comments indicated that some of the players seem to have done this as well. The Exchange process was good and painless. Luckily we got the combo pack and can still watch the DVD."
1,Light it up,Extremely dark transfer. I hope WB will make a new print. It really ruined my fun. Some scenes are so dark that you barely see the sides of the screen
1,The blackened movie.,"I was very disappointed in the dark movie. Couldn't even see the movie most of the time. The story was great, if you could see it. I think it was copied. I have never seen a movie so dark. I have ordered others and movies were never like that. I am very, very disappointed."
5,"Great movie, looks good on BD.","I loved the books and the movie in the theater. The movie looks great on Blue-ray, but I'd have to say that there are better looking BD titles, like the new Alice In Wonderland for example. Perhaps it's the darker scenery (and tone) of this movie. It still blows away the standard-def DVD."
3,Parry Hotter,"Good movie, but I don't get all the fuss. This was a gift for my Wife, who is bonkers for Young Master Potter."
2,Worst Harry Potter film yet,"I didn't know what the point of this movie was, did you? Out of all the HP movies so far, this has got to be one of the absolute worst. The story and the book is great, but whoever directed this movie , needs to learn how to direct."
1,A Major Let Down.,"I own all other Harry Potter movies. But, I could not watch this one more than half way. It is senseless, a collection of disjointed scenes. It is more like a 2nd rated soap opera. What a let down. I am glad I only spend $1 rental fee."
1,Sound and picture quality terrible,"I bought one of these DVD's and it looks as though filmed it in a theater on a CELL-PHONE. Has Amazon taken to selling counterfeit DVD's? Dialogue is impossible to make out and the pictures are bathed in mud.If this DVD is NOT counterfeit, the studio should be ASHAMED of itself for foisting such trash on the public!I don't know whether I like the movie itself --- after watching this DVD, I have no idea what the movie was about."
3,Disappointed,"When I say that I was disappointed in this product, I don't mean that I was disappointed with Amazon's delivery of the product-although they did fib about the look and contents of the package. At first glance I noticed that it was a movie that possibly printed in another country (possibly France) because the front and back covers were printed in French and English. But luckily, the movie was in English. But the disappointing aspect of this review was the movie itself. A large part of this movie was storyline which I appreciated but as far as special effects and how it was filmed was my least favorite of the Harry Potter films. Of all the Harry Potter films this was my least liked because of the way it was filmed and because of the severe lack of incorporating the context of the book into the film."
2,"The movie itself was okay,","though it seemed to represent far too little of the book.The problem is the disc they sent me. First of all, it was not shrink wrapped. Used? I don't buy used dvd's. And it was shipped by Amazon, along with other free shipping items, so it should have been new. When I opened it, there was a large blue blob on the face of the disc. I tried to remove said blue blob gently, but it did not come off. Since the disc played okay, I guess IO can't complain about the blue crud.This disc was priced the same as the TWO Deathly Hallows discs combined. You'd think it would therefore be twice as good, in condition and in content. Not so."
3,ok,"My customer is very happy that I could find this movie for him, so he could complete the entire collection."
4,"Somewhat flawed, but still enjoyable","First, the flaws. The waitress scene in the beginning was unnecessary and took away from other elements that should have been included. More time at the joke shop would have been good.The fire at The Burrow was well done, and added another dimension to the movie. However, the only inkling we got of the relationship between Lupin and Tonks was her calling him sweetheart just before the attack. Very jarring, even for those of us who knew they were a couple.There were a lot of scenes that were very well done, but what made the movie for me was Dumbledore. Michael Gambon finally got the character right and just in time. His interpretation of our beloved headmaster in the previous movies left me cold, and I was concerned that I wouldn't care about the character's final fate. Not so. Those final scenes were everything I could have wished."
1,Insulting to the books and to watch.,"As our heroes grow older they have invariably grown far less mature. The topics actually covered in the movie are trifling and almost ridiculous (i.e. a group of teachers standing quietly and awkwardly by while two hormone-crazed teens talk about who loves whom...), and the book plot that was disregarded and omitted held so much more depth and detail. This movie is a disappointment for fans of the books I imagine, as it was for me. I find it's treatment of young love insulting not only to teenagers in general, but to the actors and audience as well. I wouldn't avoid this movie as it's a necessary step in the series evolution but it's content is going to be a let down for anyone expecting something with insight or profundity."
2,Disappointment,This review is for the film.. i will updated once i get the DVD.I was incredibly disappointed when i saw Order of the Phoenix. Its my favorite book of the series and they completely butchered it on film. I went to see Half Blood Prince thinking that it was going to be a different experience..and I was right.. it was WORSE! They concentrated too much on things that weren't important to the story (romances are you serious?) and cut scenes that SHOULD have been included (battle in hogwarts). The most disappointment though.. was the ending. Dumbledore death...well.. it wasn't as sad as it was in the book. It was very emotionless to me. What was up with that?It had some good. The visual affects were amazing... and the acting improved quite a bit. Tom Felton did an incredible job as Draco Molfoy. Kuddos to him!! Unfortunately it wasn't enough to save the film. I was more bored to tears than anything else. I hope the last installment its worth watching!
3,VCR not usable,"I purchased this VCR for a gift and they are returning it to me because it is not the right format for their VCR...It will not play in a normal, regular VCR set up but must be played on some advanced equipment. Would I be able to return it?"
1,Time for Horny Harry to Take a Hike,"Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe, he of the bushy, burgeoning unibrow), is no match for Twilight's Edward Cullen. Oh sure, Harry's hormones are raging now, severely compromising his efforts to thwart the powers of darkness that have beset his young life, but it all feels so unnatural, as if the boy wizard's inablility to keep it in his pants is merely a ploy by the producers to fend off the REAL threat to Harry's future: the massively successful Twilight franchise. You've had your day Harry, so take a hike before the vampires come for you!"
2,Harry the Wimp?,"Among other disappointments with this movie was the ending. In the book Harry is immobilized and cannot do anything when Dumbledore is killed. In the movie he is not even immobilized and he just stands there and does nothing! The Harry Potter I know would in no way have just stood there and let Dumbledore be slaughtered. He would have tried to come out of his hiding place, screamed, tried anything to save him! The entire ending of the book was simply left out, too,as Dumbledore's death is just sort of glossed over. And where were all the questions in Harry's mind as to how Dumbledore could not know that Snape was on Voldemort's side? These questions Harry asks himself are extremely important to what is to come. Finally, is this a Harry Potter story or just a love story? I think the makers of this film wanted to appeal to the teenagers in the audience rather than make a faithful adaptation. I thought this was the worst of the movies yet."
2,Eh.,"As a devout Potter head, I am sad to say that this movie was pretty bad. The only reason I bought it was b/c I want to own the entire series.In sum, nothing happens in this movie, the events are not even close to events in the book, and don't get me started on the important aspects which were left out. Don't purchase unless you need to own the entire series."
1,Awful adaptation...,I have been a huge fan of the HP series both the books and the films. I never have been dissapointed by the films no matter how different they may have been from the books. I understand not everything can be placed in the films. However that being said.. The Half Blood Prince film adaptation was the worst... The book was gripping and exciting filled with all the things we have come to expect from the HP universe.. The film strips all that down and takes away a lot of what needed to be seen... and even adds things that either don't happen until later in other books or things that never happened... The movie was a huge let down.. I only hope they can make up for it with the last two...
4,A True Cinephile Would Know Better,"Mainly I just wanted to point out that I too loved all the books and have seen all the films, many times.What I'd like to point out to all the detractors out there about book to film adaptations, is that you really need to quit complaining that films don't match up to the books, ANY BOOK.There is no way anybook can be made into a film word for word or plot point to plot point. Movies would be over six hours long. You need to appreciate films for themselves. You will always find something wrong with any film if you look for it.The fact is you need to be able to sit back relax and let the ""film"" not the ""book"" entertain you. Also most films based in metaphysics or science fiction need you to leave logic and embrace the the notion of suspending belief at the door. So please just take the time to enjoy the films you watch for what they are 90 to 150 mins of escapism, a place to leave the worries and stresses of everyday life and relax to a good story."
2,Wish I could actually OWN this movie,"When I bought it, I thought I'd be able to download it to my computer, since I travel a lot and don't have access to a wireless network all the time. No such luck, only a PC gets to download it, and only after installing a player for it? I have a Mac, and I get to STREAM it, for $9.99! I'm NEVER buying another digital movie on Amazon."
4,I Would Give This About 3.75 Stars If I Could...,"Like the book, not much happens action-wise, and Yates didn't help by choosing to take out the skirmish at Hogwarts at the end or have the Death Eaters stroll out of the school (where were the Aurors who were suppose to be providing security?) This made the pacing of the movie seem sluggish at times.Some of the dialogue was also weird and the non-urgency of Hagrid and Snape in the cursed necklace and Sectumsempra scenes, respectively, was off-putting.But the best acting of the young stars (with the exception of Bonnie Wright) can be found here, particularly: Tom Felton, Dan (especially in the Felix Felicis scene), Rupert (with his comedic timing), and Emma (with the canary scene being a highlight). And the soundtrack behind this movie is my favorite.All in all, this is my third favorite Harry Potter movie so far (behind Prisoner of Azkaban and Order of the Phoenix)."
1,"No climax, insipid character development","The Worst H Potter in the franchise. The movie went nowhere, without any climax and the worst acting/client development I've seen in a film. Why after so many crisis that Harry has conquered would anyone question his intuition or experiences? But his staunchest allies do - both to his and my frustration. The absolute worst movie I've wasted time watching and wished I'd never paid money for the DVD."
1,Video Quality = Garbage,"I'm not sure how Warner Brothers can get away with this. I have watched literally thousands of major studio released DVDs in my lifetime and this is by far the worst looking title I've come across. The picture is garbage. It looks like a bootleg at best, especially while being played through and upconversion DVD player. In the least, this piece of trash costs $15 (though I've seen it for over $20). This is something that should be given away for free to see if consumers want to pay for an actual quality copy. This goes beyond bad quality control, this is about a studio not giving a [you-know-what] and hustling away your hard earned money.The Blu-ray release looks wonderful, and there are no such issues with their HD disc. The video quality has nothing to do with the film, and everything to do with the inept DVD team at Warner Brothers.Please do not buy this DVD if you like this movie and can see well."
1,Huge disappointment,"I really hope the writer of this movie is ashamed of him or herself. This was the poorest movie of the Harry Potter series thus far. It would seem to me that anyone giving this movie higher than a 3 star rating did not read the book. I feel bad for J.K Rowling that this great book was made into such a travesty of a movie. It's an embarassment. Too bad the writer didn't spend more time writing things into the movie that happened in the book rather than writing things out. I would say that if you read the book, just be prepared to be let down. Even if I hadn't read the book, I think I would still only give it about 3 starts. I purchased the Blu-ray set with the digital copy and I dislike the movie so much that I don't think I will even download the free digital copy. Such a waste. All I can say to the writer is...What in the world were you thinking and shame on you. To J.K. Rowling, my sympathy."
1,Destroyed by Maximum Movie Mode,"I have read a number of the reviews for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I was looking in particular for comments about Maximum Movie Mode, which I cannot turn off on my Samsung BD-P2500 player. So, I haven't actually been able to see most of the movie. Why on earth would anyone want to watch a movie with dumb little pop-ups appearing every few minutes? They completely destroy the flow of the movie. Perhaps I will end up agreeing with the negative reviews (this was my favorite HP book and it sounds as though the movie is a big disappointment); but I would at least like to see it in order to decide for myself whether or not it is any good."
3,bored & repetitive,"I loved the other movies, waiting for this, i was disappointed. There was repetitive nonsense, and necessary scenes seem to b missing, then the end which was incomeplete, wasnt at all over the top, until the last ""freindship"" scene, what a shame! Im givin it 2stars for acting and graphics"
1,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Full-Screen),This product never arrived and contact with Elations was attempted with no results.I am very disappointed.
5,First Blu Rey disc is fabulous.,"I have all the Harry Potter movies in regular DVD plus the trunk set that came out a couple years ago. Since I recently got a big screen Hi Def TV and a Sony Blu Rey Player (through Amazon) I am getting the boxed sets as they come out in Blue Rey but decided to go ahead and get this 6th movie in Blu Ray. The movie is great (I saw it twice in the IMAX 3-D) and it's just as much fun on Blu Ray disc. The movie is the best yet and it is fun to watch in Blu Ray as the detail that shows is just amazing. The service from Amazon was fast and it arrived in perfect condition, as always. I am very happy with this purchase."
4,My favorite so far,I tried seeing this movie at the theatre but took my 4 month old and she wanted to yell throughout the movie so I spent 85% of my time sitting in the lobby. I decided to purchase the Blu Ray version because I love the Harry Potter movies and I have the other ones in HD. The picture is great and the movie was really really good. My favorite Harry Potter so far. I didn't really care for the one before this but this one more then made up for it!
3,Half-Yawn Prince,"I like Harry Potter movies but Half-Blood Prince was too long and boring, at 153mins they could easily edit 30-40mins to make it more interesting. I literally fell asleep watching this movie."
1,Shipped wrong version!,"Well, my wife and I were all excited to get the new Harry Potter movie on Blu-ray but when we received it it was not what we ordered! We ordered and confirmed that we were supposed to get the Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy and BD-Live. That is what our online invoice states and that is what our receipt in the box states but we received the Blu-ray + BD-Live only version! Even when I click the online invoice it now reverts to this BD-Live version of the movie.I spoke to customer service and they are working to get the correct one out but their system will not allow for a replacement. I cannot even find the version we actually purchased on the Amazon site anymore. Such false advertising if they do not rectify the situation.I usually get excellent service from Amazon but I will be extremely dissapointed if this situation is not rectified quickly."
2,A Disappointment,"As a big fan of the Harry Potter books and also of the movies (up to this point) I found myself tremendously underwhelmed and disappointed by this film. While the performances and overall look of the movie were well done, I don't understand why the choice was made to give such short shrift to:- the revelation of Snape as the Half Blood Prince- Dumbledore's death- Dumbledore's funeral- the battle scene after the funeralAh well. We have Deathly Hallows to look forward to, and though I'm further disappointed that they chose to do it in two films rather than a longer one with an intermission (they used to do that, you know, when attention spans were longer), one can only hope they'll treat the final installment with a little more respect."
3,Unforgivable...,"I was going to give this movie more stars, because even with the stupid stuff they added in that NEVER happened in the book, while leaving out or totally twisting other story lines, there were some great parts (I especially loved Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry on Felix Felicis, so funny!!)and I still love to see the books come to life ...BUT - The fact that they didn't have Dumbledore petrify Harry and instead had Harry willingly stand there without trying to help Dumbledore... unforgivable. It's just INSANE that they changed that part :( Harry would have never just stood there, that is why Rowling made Dumbledore petrify him in the first place, it goes against everything in his nature and in the nature of the books & story as a whole."
1,Not as great as the first 5,"This 6th movie of the Harry Potter series was not as good as I was lead to believe. It was very dark and hard to see what was going on compared to the other movies. I may end up selling all my other Harry Potter DVDs since I will not have a complete collection - in other words I am not keeping this one. It also was very hard to follow the plot anymore. It was poorly written and directed. I would suggest that the movie be remade and with a lot more lighting, better directing, and writing."
3,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,I love the Harry Potter series and Half-Blood Prince is one of the best books in the series. To be honest i enjoyed the movie except for the beginning and the ending. I didn't care for the fact that Dumbledore had met Harry at the train station. I was really excited to read in the book that Dumbledore had gone to the Dursley's and took Harry out of there. I was also disappointed when they didn't have Dumbledore's funeral. They pretty much just let him lay dead on the pavement. I thought the cave was exciting and i was really happy that it turned out the way it did in my head when i read the book. I thought it was a bit dark and different for the Harry Potter series. I liked that the writters incorporated the fact that Tonks and Lupin were in a relationship. I thought that it could have had a better ending. All in all i like H-BP and anyone who is a big fan of the books would probably like me and be alittle dissapointed!
5,Great,Purchased this for the kids to add to their collection and I have to say it was pretty good. Recommend.
3,"After awhile, too much Potter is like cold oatmeal",I stopped liking the Potter films as of film 4 or 5. I got this 'cuz it was cheap and I hadn't seen it. It did not disappointment me. It was BORING.
5,Harry Potter and half-blood Prince dvd,this was given to me for Christmas by my wife. She knows that I realy enjoy the Harry Potter series and I have all the rest of the dvd's. To know how much I like it....I've watched it at least 5 times since I got it.
2,"Disappointing movie, not a good edition","If you want this movie, buy the blu-ray version. It's both cheaper and has a better quality movie."
5,Heck Frickin' Yes!,"Great movie, great books!! Loved the Harry Potter series ever since my second grade teacher read me the books in class!"
5,Cheap and Worth more,"I've been trying to get all the Harry Potter movies for a while, but dont wanna spend $20 on eachso I went to the internet to find this nice buyThankfully it came on time and with everything it promisedI think it was more than worth it and will be looking for the last two"
3,TOO MUCH LEFT OUT,Too much of the story was left out and the continuity of the series suffered with this installment. Hopefully the final two movies will fill in the blanks.
2,Love Harry But Half Blood BIG Disappointment,"I know that when you read the book, the movie will fall short and the other HP movies worked pretty well at providing a good story. However, Half Blood Prince was more about raging hormones than the core message of this story. I was especially disappointed at the end. How could intruders enter Hogwarts, kill Dumbledore, destroy the Great Hall and then just leave without detection or response FROM ANYBODY in the castle???? I get the feeling that now that everyone's made their $$$ they really don't care what kind of movie is pumped out. . ."
4,Good product,"DVD arrived the day of release, as I'd hoped.My wife was a little disappointed by the lack of bonus features."
2,Very poor audio and picture quality review-low buget production?,"Product was received within period specified @ order......The audio is poor, video quality resembles an old faded film, the color is off, faded,dark,lifeless.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (+ BD-Live) [Blu-ray]"
1,Poorly Done,"Not only is this version unfaithful to the book, it skips over some of the most important scenes and instead fills them with horrifically acted romantic scenes. I was hopeful this adaptation would have some worthwhile parts but they were few and far between."
1,boo hiss,I have amazon prime and could not get this movie streamed to my device. We called customer service and they could not fix the problem. We were also promised a $10.00 amazon coupon that we never received. I am a little disappointed with this situation.
4,Good but they left alot out...,"We watched this after finishing the book, I have to say that out of all 8 movies this one probably failed fans the most. There was so much of the story left out and it seemed very rushed. But still it's Harry Potter so it still gets four stars."
4,"It doesn't follow book exactly, but looks good- great extras","None of the movies have closely followed the books they're based, I remember that much in reading/ watching each story, but they always ""look good"" and this movie is worth watching maybe even if you didn't read the book. The extras with this 2disc edition are good, I always buy 2 disc editions and this is definitely one you should do that with."
5,Harry Potter on UMD,"I am so glad to have found this UMD. I wish I could find all of the Harry Potters on UMD. I usually convert movie files so I can store them on a memory card for my PSP. But that starts taking up a lot of room, so it's nice to have the disc."
4,Awesome movie,"This movie was a great movie. I loved it. Yes it was a typical ""middle book"" so it leaves you hanging and it seems to go a bit slow in places. No it doesnt follow the book to the letter but then none of the movies have followed the books to that degree. It would be impossible to do so. If they tried it would make Lord of the Rings look like a short story. Taking all of that into account I like the character progressions in the story. I will watch it again and again as I will the whole series."
2,THIS ONE'S A DOG!,"For me, and this is just me, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a clunker. The plot is slow, plodding, and the whole storyline just kind of lies there. I received my copy in brand new, pristine condition, but after one viewing, I gave it to our mobile home park's ""trash and treasure"" auction. The book just HAS to be better than this one."
2,Complete roadblock,"While some parts I liked, the movie seemed like a step back in the series, there was less continuity. In the movie universe, when the hell did Harry started noticing Ginny, in the books, they gave somewhat closure to the Cho crush, but they didn't show that in the previous film. The other thing is, what happened to the battle, the producers said that they cut it out to prevent repetiveness. That was what some people wanted to see, for me it would have been a taste for whats to come in the final hogwarts battle. Lastly, I got large helping of teen angst, I get that they are teenagers, but if I wanted to see that, I would have watched the CW. Thankfully they made up for it in the Deathly Hallows."
3,The bent nose boys at Warner Brothers schlock by again.,"They did it again. I don't blame the British actors for collecting pay checks on another film, but if you are following the series, be glad there is only one book left for the film makers to screw up. I expect the boys at WB to try to slip by with 3D, advertisements/blurbs about nude scenes, and special effects next time. The whole series is about growing up, integrity, honesty, friendship, and getting on with life. Hollywood keeps getting lost in their own cleverness, and forgets the point of the story."
5,great movie price for new release,I purchased this as a gift for christmas and it was great to see it a such a low price. Fast shipping and new product. Thank You!
1,Waste of money,There are no additional scenes. This is not an extended edition. It's just a lot of packaging and the same movie. So don't waste your time.
3,Not an Ultimate Edition,"I bought this just to complete the set that I started buying when the first two ""Ultimates"" were released. ""Ultimates"" 3-6 not ultimates as far as additional deleted scenes. Still waiting."
1,"This is about the disc, not the movie.","Wow, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the blu-ray experience, totally sucked. After fast-forwarding through the Wizard of Oz advertainment (nothing against TWOO, mind you) four times, no combination of 'maximum Experience' options would actually play the movie w/o Rupert Grint popping in, picture-in-picture, followed shortly by special effects options and a special section from the director about the Millenium Bridge. This is fine on a rainy Saturday afternoon when I've seen it 6 times already, but I really miss just inserting the disc and watching the movie.AARGH!This is only the 2-disc edition; perhaps if I'd sprung for the 3-disc edition there'd be one disc that just worked.(If you were hoping for a movie review, I apologize; when I get one that actually plays the movie w/o the bonus distraction layer, I'll try to come up with something.)"
3,The Half Blood Mystery?,"First off, if you're a Harry Potter fan like me, you have to watch this movie. But be prepared it falls way short of any of the movies in the series.If I had not read the books I would have been completely lost trying to keep up with the story. I walked away from the movie really wanting to like it because there are some great scenes. But again, they always seemed to make you say "" Okay, that's it."" That was how I felt about the entire movie "" That's it.""I really hope the last two films make us forget about this one. Still, you need to see the movie because it is J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter, and it is some of the best scifi ever. Me and my family love the Harry Potter series and would highly recommend them."
2,Harry Potter and the Half Done Script,"Unfortunately this episode will go down as the dullest, most boring of the lot. A plodding, scatterbrained story line that leaves you wondering - ""what just happened"" and ""what does this mean""? The action sequences present in all previous episodes are virtualy non-existent in this one, and weak performances by the three primary characters make this film a real stinker!"
2,Less of everything,Little magic. Little action. Less adventure. Most characters except Harry were in the background. The whole thing was a boring drama. By far the worst HP film to date.
2,"Slow...sadly, not that good","I dislike negative reviews, but not all of them can be flowers and lollipops. Seems like as the sequels went, the story got worse. Maybe I'm missing something but this one was slow, uninteresting and boring. The best part of the movie was the last 15 minutes, and that was a stretch. I own all the others, but won't be adding this one to my library. IMO, if it weren't produced, it wouldn't be missed."
1,Don't waste your money,"Well except for all the same characters, plus a few new ones, I just wonder if the writer of the screenplay even read the book.J.k. Rowlings must have shuddered when she read what was a great load of tosh. I notice there are no mentions of her anywhere, except for a wee note about based on a novel by her. some of the major characters have been left out. Dumbledore aperates with harry from the astronomy tower. No Bill, no Phlemn and things are totally out of order.A total travesty of a fine book ruined by a stupid movie"
1,this moive could have been better,i agree with the last review i read and have decided not to buy the movie i have all the rest migth buy the extened version if its any better doubt it to much important stuff left out to possibly carry the story to the next mmovie without destroying the whole point of the stoy line
2,NO DISK 2?!?!,so0 after a long wait.... i get my Harry potter and the half blood prince 3-disk combo and.... no disk 2.... HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?!?!?!?! good thing about it is that i called amazon and theyre going to send me a new one.... theyre paying for shipping of course.... i guess thats the good part... i really wanted disk 2 tho!
3,Aspect Ratio 1.77:1 ????,"So as we all noticed there will be NO extended cut for these new boxsets, but check out the aspect ratio specification listed on Amazon, 1.77 instead of 2.40??!!! Dose that mean that these new sets will be released on IMAX version? If that is the case then these new sets are definitely worth getting, extended or not."
2,Beware!,"Beware when buying this product! I bought it specifically for the digital copy. What the product description does not tell you is that the code used to redeem or download your digital copy expired in 2010! So, if you just want the movie, fine, but if you want the digital copy, don't waste your money!"
2,WARNING: Does NOT contain digital copy,"Despite clearly stating ""+ Digital Copy"" in the title description, the digital copy was for a limited time and has since expired. I bought this version specifically for the digital copy because HP6 is not available on iTunes. I didn't discover this until I opened the package and tried to download the digital copy. I hope Amazon will let me return it opened.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the movie is actually good. However, this product is not."
1,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Theater,"I found this movie to be very lacking and was always thinking ""What? No that's wrong? Why is that even in there? And where is...."" I hated this movie and couldn't wait for it to be over. It had nothing to do with the book but shairing the same name. That's it."
3,What is described is not what you receive,"I purchased the Two-Disc Special Edition of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. It was an awesome movie, that's not the reason for my ""it's ok"" 3 stars. The description says it has subtitles in Spanish, French and English. Nope, that couldn't be further from the truth. It's only the French edition. Subtitles only in French. Yeah, that isn't going to do me a bit of good."
3,GOOD ACTION BUT NOT HOW THE BOOK WAS,"I did not like the beginning of the movie because that's not how it was in the bookthey detour a lot in the beginning of the movie compared to the bookthe book way was better and safer for harry potterin the Movie Ginny hidden the book, but in the story harry potter hidden the bookOne of the hoaxus is in the secret room where the potions book was hidden"
5,Sad ending!,"Harry potter is one of my favorite movies to watch. This movie was awsome, but it has a very sad ending with a famous wizard getting killed by one of the teachers in the Hogwarts school. Traitor. Can't wait for the last Harry Potter movie."
4,Harry Potter Half-blood Prince,"I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas, and she has read all of the books and seen all of the movies, and asked for these, so I think she really likes both the movies and the books. I only saw the first movie and thought it was well done."
2,Harry Potter and Prince,Very Poor lproduction. Too dark and disconnected. Worst of the Harry Potter movies thus far.
5,Adding to the series....,"Adding to the ones I already had.....good price, beat everyone else and a good watch."
5,Extras are highly amusing!,"While some might be dettered by the extra price of this special edition, the extras are worth it. The actor interviews that they did are hilarious and lets you get to know many of the actors who play smaller roles, which I found fascinating. The movie itself is one that is better if you have read the book before hand, but it was very well done despite that."
5,Unexpected Come Back,"I was a little disappointed with the last few movies. I wasn't sure if it was because I had gotten older and they no longer sparked interest, or if they were just getting worse. Either way, the Half-Blood Prince seemed to find a solution to both those possibilities. The movie was not only put together really well, but it also has a lot of appeal to an older audience. Maybe not to people over forty, but for those out there like me, who were 11 when the first movie came out, you can bet that Harry Potter 6 will bring it back home for you!"
1,Worth of the Series ... by Far,"I'll make this pretty short and simple. This is easily the most uneventful, boring movie of the entire series. By far. I would go as far as to say this seemed to be like some sort of dig at Twilight. Simply because it was so uneventful and boring. Especially for a movie this incredibly long. Absolutely no action whatosever. The Quidish section lasts about 4 minutes and there may be about 15 minutes of action in the title.You do finally learn how Vuldamort has survived so many times and you learn some other things, and there is of course that big moment at the end, but between all that is nothing. Absolutely nothing whatsoever. YI had enjoyed all the other movies, but this one had me yawning and looking at my watch for a long time. And boy was it a long time, two and a half hours nearly of pure boredom. Not sure what they were thinking with this movie, but it was horrible."
2,Not the book for sure.,"Very long movie. The director David Yates has more of a grasp on the special effects aspect in this film but the story plods along and the ending is ,well, not presented or as built up to as in the book."
3,Just one thing to add,"Many of these reviews are spot on. I felt that too much of the book was left out and that the effects were underdone.My big disappointment is a small thing that just indicates that the care to create the feeling of the magic world was not there in this episode. The pictures in Hogwarts were just, well.... pictures. They did not move, they had no life. This is something that the entire movie lacked.As far as buying this one, I just hate to do it only to find out there is an extended version coming out in six months. Because this seems to be a pattern for the greedy movie industry I will wait."
4,Another enrolling H Potter,"The Potter movies series has been almost as addicting as the books. The movies' themes, graphics and scripts have grown and aged as have the characters. The Half-Blood Prince was an enjoyable movie experience worth recommending."
1,dvd condition,The sad fact is this dvd arrived broken. The packaging seemed adaquit and the return policy of no returns of opened items is understandable...but...in this case it was unfortunate for me.
4,Half Blood Prince movie.. Harry Potter,"Nice movie that follows the Half Blood Prince book fairly well. Afew deviations from the book, but nothing serious. It's a movieI would recommend to any fan of the Harry Potter series.I would have given it 5 stars, but the movies colorswere a bit greyish to suit me. I like brighter colorsmyself."
2,it was great... accept not what i ordered...,when purchasing the item it said that it was a dvd not blueray... when got it i thought it was dvd becuase the main cover said dvd... however it was all of the blueray discs in the inside of the product and also the cases said blueray... had to buy an enitrely new one just to watch the film...
4,Great Flick!,I won't go on and on about this movie suffice to say it is a great flick much better than POA.
2,Half Blood Prince,"I was very disappointed in this movie. They made unnecessary changes to the story, changes that made the movie worse, not better. They cut out very important parts and added unnecessary and ridiculous scenes. Too much teenage love and not enough Half Blood Prince in the Half Blood Prince. It became Harry Potter 90210. To sum it all up, I'm afraid it committed the unforgiveable sin for a movie, it was boring."
4,good,"Obviously, the books are better, but I like the movies. This one is not the best, but they do make good choices in terms of adapting scenes that work better in a book."
5,HP - Again,"If you love the Harry Potter books and movies, this one doesn't disappoint. I saw this movie in the theatre with my family when it first released, and love having it as part of the series. My grandson and I often enjoy having Potter-thons, where we watched all of the movies in succession. Can't wait for the last installments, even though Deathly Hallows will be released in two parts.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Two-Disc Limited Special Edition)"
1,The Worst Harry Potter ever,I never read the Harry Potter books but have always enjoyed the adaptations created. Micheal Gambon did a poor job as Dumbledor (hope I spelled that right). The film dragged on forever. This film seemed to lose it way. The characters which always leap out just wimpered away. There was so many instances where the plot could have delved a little deeper. I was truly disappointed.
1,Worst Blu-Ray ever.,"This is the worst Blu-Ray of a movie I have seen. You can't see a thing in the dark parts even though you could in the theater. Also, the DVD version is only a little better, but it still stinks just as bad. The producers did aweful on the Blu-Ray conversion."
2,Very good effects... very poor scripting and direction,"When I watched the movie felt quite disappointed. I read the book and there was action, laugh, love, mistery, anger, distress, tension, pain... but you won't find any of it in the film, at least not in meaninful quantities. Don't even think of learning something about Voldemort's or the Prince's past or intentions; for that you'll have to read the book, which just happen to be named after the latter caracter, but it seems the producers, directors and script writers didn't know/notice it. I can understand some parts had to be cut in order to fit the movie, but the cut turned into butchery and some important parts didn't receive a good treatment, such as the Unbreakable Vow scene, Dumbledore's pain in the Horcrux Cave, or the final battle in the Castle. Also, olympics jumps from one scene to the other and unnecesary ones such as the burning of the Weasly's family house made this movie not as enjoyable as the previous ones. A real shame."
2,Where's the Disc?,"So, the first info says 3 discs but the description only says two - for both 5 and 6.So, which is it and what is the mysterious and possibly non-existant 3rd disc??Also, if material was cut to shorten the final film (i.e. removed only for length) then there should be no need for the director to do anything. An editor/edit team simply inserts the already ready footage (electronic signals) back at the points they were moved from. I do not know why (sarcasm) but I have a feeling there will be a New, Improved Double Ultimate Edition in our futures."
4,Best out of the bunch,"I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. Of the books anyway - the movies are nothing thrilling. I havent been happy with a single movie, until this one that is. Alright, they do take a little license from the book (a lot of license actually) and some scenes are completely pointless...but the acting has improved so much and the funny moments definitely make me laugh. Bottom line: treat HP the movie as its own entity...if you dont spend time comparing it to the book, the HP 6 is definitely the best of the series."
2,Disappointing,The quality of this DVD was not good.....at times so dark the action couldn't be seen. I would not recommend the wide screen because it looked like it was a copy of a copy.
4,Bold visuals,"Amazing visualizations of the book content. Sound effects were superb, yet the highs/lows seemed out of whack - as such having to constantly adjust volume between normal dialogue and overwhelming special sound effects lessened the experience a bit."
3,Harry Potter and the half blood prince,"I was disappointed it did not come in the case. This is the first dvd I bought off-line that wasn't in the box so even though I paid .75 I still paid $2.99 shipping. I personally don't know if it said no case it was something I didn't know to look for, since all other movies I bought came in the case I guess I just assumed they all did. Especially when you look at the item you are looking at a case. I wiill know better next time. I would of paid more for one in a case. Haven't watched it it looks scratched so hoping when we get around to a Harry Potter Marathon it's going to be ok. Did put it in the dvd player makes a funny noise but with the volume on you don't hear it."
1,Disk does not work,"Got this DVD and put it in my Samsung BD-C5500 player. When it gets to the main menu it does not display ""play"" only ""scene selection"" and ""languages"". Thought it could be a firmware issue so I upgraded - no luck. I have all the other HP BR DVD and all play with no problem. If you purchase this film check it out as soon as you get it."
2,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,This is the worst of the eight Harry Potter movies. It diverged from the book too much and added items not found in the book. It was disjointed and hard to follow the story line even when I've read the books several times. I would not recommend this movie to Harry Potter lovers.
5,Harry Potter fan,What can I say. I am a Harry Potter fan. With the purchase of this film and the Deathly Hollows 1 and 2 my collection is complete. Fun.
4,Harry Potter Half blood prince DVD,"We received the DVD, it was damaged with a indent in the actual disc. At first itlooked like we were going to return it since it would not play in our players.I attempted to take out the in-dent in the disc as it was located near the center hole and not on the DVD content area. So far it has worked, but I am still considering returning for a replacement since it was damaged when we opened it Christmas morning."
2,No captions in English,"I expected this movie to have captions in Engish. Instead, it only had captions in French. I couldn't understand very much of the spoken dialog. I returned it for a refund. The advertisement should be more specfic about this."
3,Harry Potter movie,This fills in my library of Harry Potter movies. Good movie but still like the Book better.
1,alright!,I don't think its worth the price. but its kind of cool to have the replica of the map but its not the actual size and its not the best quality..I should've bought the movie by itself and gotten the map at noblecollection. Thats only if u want the actual replica of the marauders map..
4,For Completists only,"This movie had some high and Low points, though not my most favorite of this series, Acting could of been better and they left you with a whopper of a cliff hanger, still I'd watch this again!"
3,Decent Movie Hard to use Blu Ray,Enough has been said about Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince movie. In my opinion it is not one of my favorites because it doesn't really follow the book.The Blu-Ray version is hard to use. Its my first Blu-ray disc and the menus were difficult to follow and hard to see the choices on the screen.
4,Great series good movie,"All the previous Potter movies were great. This one had great F/X effects. Although I enjoyed the movie, there seem to be something different. It seemed to be a bit more ""hammy"" if there is such a word. Not to put anybody off though, because I first saw the movie in the theater and enjoyed it enough that I bought the DVD to see it again. I recommend this movie to anybody with the notion to buy a good movie."
2,Difficulty watching Blu Ray on Samsung player,"This is not a review of the movie but of the blu ray. I have a Samsung player (firmware is the latest version) and when I inserted the disc the bonus pop ups would display regardless of any settings. I have now found the post in the forums entitled ""Blu-ray bonusview problems"" which has a successful workaround. I also had a rough time navigating the menus as the selection color is difficult to be seen so it took a few times to apply the workaround successfully.My issue is that I needed a workaround which I didn't find until I went searching. I've had this issue before with a different disc and it's frustrating to me to have such a terrible out of the box experience. If I was my mom or someone who is used to movies just playing they'd have a terrible time trying to watch the blu ray.Before I knew of the workaround I watched the DVD but it was with a fair bit of frustration and disgust in the product. I paid for blu ray and want blu ray."
2,broken case,"The case for the blue-ray was broken inside, where the disc is stored. The outside of the case was in perfect condition but the inside was shattered, but somehow the disc was not damaged. The same thing happened to another blu-ray I purchased at the same time."
1,"What exactly is ""Ultimate"" about this?","They only put the extended cuts on 1 & 2 as a way to make collectors buy this whole cash grab DVD series.There are no extended cuts of the films on 3-6. Save your money.You already have these on DVD and don't need to spend 30 bucks to see a bunch of silly ""making of"" videos that will be very much like the ones you've seen before."
2,"If you like Harry, get the audiobooks!!","As a Harry fan, I was waiting for this movie. What a bust! Tepid, disjointed, vague, etc., etc. This could have been a really slick movie but, it's like ""Harry Potter meets Dragnet""! The kids look great though, all grown up! I have heard and read negative reviews of Half Blood Prince but tried to keep an open mind, I mean, these are kids movies after all.However, Half Blood Prince really fell through the cracks! I really worried about Deathly Hallows, my favorite story of the HP series.These movies could be full animation (not cgi but real true animation like Wings of Honneamise! Now that's animation! How fun! All the wizardry, creatures and HP world drawn to perfection!If you're looking for fun Harry Potter try audioHarry Potter 1- 7 Audio CollectionJim Dale is a blast to listen to!"
3,"Good, but not great","Another Harry Potter movie, ** Yawn ** I got thru it, and it is the same as all the others. Plot: kids, evil castle/school, odd teachers, Harry, Ron, a little girl named Hermione, some bad ass dude name Voldemort, a fat dude named Hagrid, etc. What's great is if you've seen the other films, you can watch this and not pay attention. Just eat the popcorn and enjoy the awesome film visuals."
1,Disappointing,"I've loved Rowling's books, and the first three films, but I confess I found this last one disappointing. There are so many key scenes left out and strange ones put in that make no sense, I wondered at times if the film was of the book I'd read. ""Based on a novel by..."" is only too true. And don't get me started on the 17 minutes of game ads, trailers and other rubbish that are impossible to fast forward over before you are finally allowed to see what you paid for. I wonder what the author makes of it all."
1,Avoid... not extended!!!,I along with many other people bought year 3&4 expecting the deleted scenes to be added to the movies since year 1&2 had them. I was disappointed as most were that WB chose do not offer this option on further releases with out making their decision clear in the press release. If you offer something on the initial launch of a product you should make it clear if you remove a major selling feature of that product. It was not false advertising as WB never stated their would be extended cut of the movie on 3&4... but it is misleading.
1,Extremely disappointing,"This is my second favorite of the Harry Potter books, but my absolute least favorite of the movies, by far.Acting was stilted. Too many story changes. No ""magic"" at all felt during the movie. I know it should be dark because of the story line, but the director and whoever wrote the screenplay totally ruined it for me.At the end of the book, when Severus yells at Harry... ""don't call me coward!"" That is a climactic moment and it was completely left out of the movie!The whole backstory of Voldemorts mother and childhood are left out.If it was too much movie for one book, then pick up the pace. It totally dragged. I will not watch it again.If this same director is doing the next two movies, I won't bother seeing them. I would give the movie ZERO stars if I could."
1,Wasted time,"The audio on the Blu-Ray set was perhaps the worst I have hardly heard. I should clarify, background and special effects audio was clear as far as I could tell but nearly all the voice audio was unbelievably bad - garbled in many places, muffled in others, too low to hear in other spots - I believe that less than half the voice audio could be understood - incredible, must not have had any test audiences.AND the movie was so disjointed, and lack of intelligible audio so disturbing that finally the only thing left was to sit back and enjoy the video special effects (exception: try to take a close look at the mid-ground items in the storage room scenes )."
1,Blue Ray version is unplayable.,Blue Ray disk has an annoying commentary box without sound that impossible to remove.Blue ray disk is useless.Returned disk and will wait until they print a usable version to buy again.We have the whole Harry Potter collection but this disk is useless :(We have no problems paying other Blue Ray disks on our system.
2,Forced Marketing,"This movie wasn't too bad. It did deviate from the book some. It's a darker movie than the others. If you read some of the other reviews posted here, they'll be more thorough in detailing what was left out of the movie version, than the book.*** BUT THE ONE THING THAT ANNOYED ME THE MOST, WAS THE FORCED PREVIEWS YOU HAD TO SIT THROUGH AND WATCH BEFORE THE DVD MENU WOULD COME UP.*** YOU COULDN'T FAST FORWARD OR SKIP ANY OF THE THEM, OR GO TO THE DISK'S MENU.There were about a dozen previews for the multiple video games, theme amusement park, and other movie previews.This will be the first Harry Potter movie I won't buy because of this annoying feature (what a major pain in the you know what!).- Disgruntled Fan"
3,Ripped cover. Cover was in French...Weird,"Came on time, but cover was in French. Thankfully, the movie was not. Also the paper cover in its plastic case was ripped."
5,The best Potter yet,"I've been a huge fan of the book series and have loved all the movies thus far. This latest installment is clearly the best: improved acting from the young stars, plenty of humor, romance, and thrills. If you've enjoyed the previous films than this is a MUST! Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
5,I liked this episode the best so far,"It is obvious Harry is growing up, and the feel of the movie reflects this. I loved the other movies but they had a very predictable feel to them. This one was by far the best so far, but that is just me."
2,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy & BD-Live) [Blu-ray],I haven't had a chance to see the Blu-Ray nor the DVD because I've been trying to get the Digital Copy now sense I got it from Amazon.Com in the mail. So it's been days now I go to the web site on the paper in the case and it is in Spanish and I haven't got a clue on how to answer the questions I end up with a WB Digital copy manager which doesn't work either. I wish I could get some help down loading the Digital copy . The other Blu-Ray movie I got with a Digital Copy worked great but it had a down load disk available. so if any one with the WB or Amazon.com or a kind person out their can help with a down load link It would be great. Thanx anyway Mike mychills@sbcglobal.net
4,Excellent overall - but one MAJOR complaint,"This is a great BD, and I enjoy the movie. I am reviewing the BD as such, however, and pointing out the MAJOR flaw of my BD: the sound quality is poor. In fact, I have to turn up the volume so high on my big screen TV/amplification system, it is ridiculous. Is this a common complaint? I don't know. Perhaps my BD is flawed. I have numerous BD's in my library, and I've never come across this problem."
1,Waste of 2 bucks...,"I kept thinking it would get better.No, it was a complete waste of the 2 dollar fee to view it.The movie had no point, a thin plot, the only thing that happened of any import was at the end.Don't waste your time, don't buy this turkey, pretend it never happened."
3,Good Movie,I never had the time to watch HP - 6 at any cinema.It might be my mistake that I missed looking at the rergion of this DVD!!! And I did not want to change my player region setting.A friend used some software to copy it to my hard disc and I watched it.A different style than the previous movies I liked it.
4,"Great price, wish I had the DVD also","Most Blu-ray discs now come with a DVD copy (ok, Disney does), so I do wish that this did as well, so I could take it on the go. I'll wait for the combo in the future."
5,love these movies,I loved the books and i also love this movie even though it is sad spoiler alert with the death of the beloved head master dumbledore this is an excellent movie.
2,does not like the blu-ray version,I hated the blu-ray version with all of the character pop-ups. I definately will not be watching this version. The pop-ups were a total distraction. I will only view the DVD. That's a shame since I paid for both...
3,I'm just wild about Harry.,"Great movie. There was a lot of action in this continuing saga. This particular movie, however, did not have English subtitles. For anyone hard of hearing, this is not the version of the movie you want to buy."
2,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,"I only bought this movie so my collection would be complete. It is by far the worst of the Harry Potter series. I guess one flop out of 8 movies is okay. The movies had until now, took great pains to follow and depict the most essential parts of JK Rowlings amazing tale. This one was a big miss. Deathly Hallow part I was awesome, and I am counting down the days, minutes, and hours, until part II premieres."
3,"Easy plane read, but extremely flawed...","Ram Oren certainly has a knack of defining what's on the Israeli society's mind, but unfortunately he does this by taking the lowest possible denominator to write his books."
3,Good but not amazing,"This CD had some good songs like ""Girls"", ""Brass Monkey"" and ""You've got to Fight for Your Right to Party"" but to be a 5-star CD in my book, 3 good songs aren't enough."
5,Good old times,"Licensed To Ill was one of my very first cassette tapes I ever owned. I owned this back in Ames, Iowa when I was about 9 or 10 years old. I remember being very afraid of getting caught listening to this tape because it contained quite a few bad words for its time.There some absolute classics on this album. This album launched a very successful career for the B-Boys. This is a good-times record. Licensed to Ill is all about fun, and has a great party atmosphere.Also, it was one of the first albums to blend rock and hip-hop. Groundbreaking for its time, it still rocks today!"
2,Alot of Faults,"ok this CD is mostly junk. [i think] It has many weird and unusual songs. I like about two songs on here. ""Brass Monkey"" and ""Fight for your right to party."" Thats it. All of their other songs are so.... different. My oponion on this album is ""Don't buy it."" I am personally saying that because I am a BIG rock fan and a big fan of some rap. [like outkast] If you're into the Beastie Boys A LOT then go and buy this album. But i'm warning you, this is definately not like their newer stuff like ""hello nastie."" I personally think that the anthology is A LOT better than this album. If anybody wants this album and you're a rock fan, DON'T BUY IT!"
1,ugh...,"I bloody hate this. It's...noise. Not pleasant to hear. My obnoxious roommate is constantly playing this shit, and it makes me want to assume a fetal position and start screaming. Not for people who like good music..."
1,Party For Your Right To Fight?,"Back in the day, no one took the Beastie's seriously; they were portrayed as brainless frat boys who wished they had been born black. Nowadays people regard them as genius innovators. Frankly I'm inclined to agree with the original assessment"
3,One of the original hip-hop rap type rock groups,"Classic album, an original. Not usually my type of music but it completes a collection for me. Purchased this after one of the original members recently passed away."
5,Licensed Classic,"At it's time of release in 1986 the blend of rock/rap/hip-hop was the greatest combination for the production found on Licensed To Ill. Not only was this the Beastie Boys debut, it was a breakthrough for rap being this was some white boys doing it. ""...the three bad brothers we know so well..."" had everything covered from hardcore, party, comedy into this 13 track release. Production was done by co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, Rick Rubin. Getting help from all angles, Run-DMC wrote ""Slow And Low"" and also co-wrote with the Boys the classic, ever so sampled ""Paul Revere"". Beastie Boys often flowed in and out well to give us each a part of their personality that still hasn't been duplicated by a rap group to date. All tracks were basically singles, with no fillers, interludes or featured guests."
5,THIS CD KICKS!! great party music,"The best of the beasties! A must have for any true b-boys fan. The best tracks are ""She's crafty"" and ""No sleep till brooklyn."""
5,This kinda RAP I like...... Love!,"A long time ago I thought I was into rap. Then I leaned back towards classical/electronic instrumentals. Then I got into rock. Eventually I purchased this CD hearing it raved as the rap revolutionizing CD. All that gangsta rap I ""listened"" to a long time ago, well, I was right about not liking it. Old skool is now my favorite genre, thanks to this CD. Each song is refreshingly different, but they are all perfect. Paul Revere, is, well, ingenious =) Just as every Beastie Boys CD, this is essential, but not just for fans. Licensed to Ill is for everyone. For every collection."
5,AWSOME,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,The joke is...,"Not that they could crash thier plane, what the heck is that? The joke is that the number of the plane is 3MTA3. Overall a popular album, but if you were to have just one BB album it's gotta be Pauls Boutique."
4,not up to potential but still good,"License to Ill is a decent effort by the Beastie Boys. We all like songs like no sleep til brookly and fight for your right to party. It definetely was a groundbreaking rap album. .... However, it seems like looking at the groups later material that they album could have been a lot better. If you listen to paul's boutique or ill communication you'll see that. However licensed to ill is still a really great album if you're at a party even after all these years which shows that the band was up to something good when the wrote the album."
3,Some fun stuff,"I do think rap is ""music"" [anybody] could make. But just because something is stupid, doesn't mean it's not fun. And this album is fun, I admit. Unfortunately, the best track intended for it was the Beasties Boys' version of The Beatles' ""I'm Down,"" that I once heard on the radio. But Michael Jackson owns the Beatles' songs, and he wouldn't allow the Beasties to release it. But if you can track it down somehow, I recommend you do. It will be worth listening to, along with the best tracks on this album, like ""Brass Monkey"" and ""Fight For Your Right."" (I love that a reviewer below recommended parents buy the album for their kids, as she has done...when ""Fight For Your Right"" is all about rebelling against your parents! )"
5,Let there be ill,"I've waited way too long to buy this album. This album is definitely a must-have in my book, not only for pioneering the area of Caucasian rap, but also for the unique style of rap that they brought. As I get older, it makes me sad when I see the generation gap, and ""Fight For Your Right"" and ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" isn't part of the new generation's collective memory. If I ever have a child, I'm buying the casette tape for this album, sticking it a boombox, putting that boombox on my shoulder, and blasting ""Paul Revere"" as the child exits the womb. These songs are simply classics, and it's a crime for kids today to not know what they are."
4,Paramount for the music collection,"""Licensed to Ill"", the Beastie Boys' record setting album with the hits ""No Sleep 'til Brooklyn"" and ""Sabotage"" opens the ears and eyes of many listeners to a unique sound of rap and rock, though the artists would never have allowed themselves to be categorized as such.This album opened doors for new-age thinking along the lines of rap music, and the fusion of rock to birth an era of heavy lyrics and sharp-toned sounds emphasizing the emotions of musicians toward their local and national government, and still spinning a funny theme of irony in their music videos that followed. ""Licensed to Ill"" is a necessity to music enthusiasts and likely a paramount album for many early '90s-influenced musicians."
4,"""Had a little horsey named Paul Revere""","Never have been much of a rap or hip hop fan, but I loved this thing when it first came out when I was in high school way back in '86...when rap was still somewhat new. I liked the harder edge and how it married guitars and rap, especially in songs like ""Rhymin and Stealin"" and the hits ""Fight For Your Right"" and ""No Sleep to Brooklyn"". Kerry King even threw in some guitar work on 'No Sleep to Brooklyn'. Thanks to Rick Rubin's production.Other great songs are ""She's Crafty"", ""Girls"", ""Paul Revere"", ""Brass Monkey"", and ""Slow and Low"". There is a fair amount of variety in these songs, and that's why it's less of a traditional rap album as compared to their later stuff.Yeah, the lyrics are adolescent at times, but in the end License to Ill is a fun album with fun lyrics and music. And isn't that what it's all about?"
5,An Old School Classic,"Almost every song off of the Beastie Boys' first and most popular album, Licensed to Ill, is recognizable (""Fight For Your Right"" and ""Brass Monkey""). Even though the production is a little outdated, it is still a worthy listen to get a reminder of how traditional b-boy old school hip-hop was back in the day."
5,In reference to the guy who gave Licensed 3 stars,"The guy from New York gave Licensed to Ill 3 stars because it only had 3 good songs on it??? I noticed that he mentioned all three ""hit"" songs. So that means just because the rest of the songs aren't hits that means this album is not that good? Give me a break, those songs he mentioned are probably the WEAKEST songs on the album. This album is a Hip-Hop classic. So, i guess this guy is gonna give the beatles white album 2 stars because it only had one number one hit. Hey, Huey Lewis' sports album had 8 top 10 hits...SO I GUESS THAT ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME, HUH?"
5,Great as always,"Beastie Boys is always great, and now right now i am only 12 and when i was younger about 8 or 9 my brother(who is now 16)started listening to Beastie Boys(and still does)and so i started to listen to them. i would have to say this is my favorite album because my favorite song on this album is Brass Monkey. this cd is a must have!"
5,The Best Beastie Boys Album,"Licensed To Ill has got to be the best album the Beastie Boys have produced. No, it's not the most mature like Hello Nasty or the most talked and raved about like Paul's Botique but this was the album that totally got me into the Beasties.I can not truley describe the feeling I get when I listen to this CD but I just say it is filled with pure fun. All songs are fantastic, including number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11..............."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,"I was lucky enough to get this CD as the second b-boys CD. But for those of you living in caves and who haven't heard about this album, get it! If you like punk-rock and rap, this is what you've been searching for! Rhymin' and Stealin' contains the beat from Led Zepplin which is one of the boys many influences. Check out Paul's Boutique also. Get those two albums and you will have the best and still untouched beastie boys material!"
3,Old News,"I like there later stuff, but Rap like rock reaches a point where there's no where new to go!"
5,toledo's east side juggalette.,". Rhymin & Stealin 0/102. The New Style 2/103. She's Crafty 8/104. Posse In Effect 10/105. Slow Ride 5/106. Girls 10/107. Fight For Your Right 10/108.

2,"Comical, that's it!","I loved the production, the guitars and the wit. ""Fight For Your Right To Party"" is one of the most famous party rap anthems of all time. Everything else is trash. The Beasties' rhyming skills have never evolved, although their musical diversity has given them the props needed to veil that fact, and frequently they are just f**king inaudible! Altogether a fun but average albumP.S. To Mr.or Mrs. bolsy32@aol.com - From a life-long rap fan, I can only say this to you - you don't know JACK about hip-hop! Your remarks (""standard rap is talentless noise"", ""White noise is better"") is totally ignorant and straight-up racist. The fact that you have only listened to the Beastie Boys proves your pitiful misunderstanding. Go listen to far more talented rap lyricists like KRS-One, Rakim, EPMD, Tupac, Biggie, Public Enemy, N.W.A. and A Tribe Called Quest. If you don't, I advise you to stay quiet and go back to listening to alternative rock.Peace! HIP-HOP 4 LIFE, kid!"
2,Really?,"Okay, looking at the picture of the product shown and you would expect three packs of these locks, correct? NO.... you recieve ONE 1/2 inch lock. Horrible describtion."
2,Don't waste your money,disjointed and not very satisfactory as a how-to book. Hard to believe this kind of book can find a market. A few ideas have some sparkle but not many for the price.
3,"It was ""OK""","While this book is a good ""how-to"" for the some of the basics in book binding, I thought the individual projects were not particularly inspiring. The gallery, on the other hand, was really nice. I think the book would be best for those new to book binding, but able to come up with the interesting details themselves."
3,Pretty Basic,"If you've played around making books already, then this is not the best book for you, as its ideas are rather simple, and (sorry) a little flat. The typographical errors in the book were distracting; the author/artist deserved better. However, if you've worried that you're not smart or talented enough to make your own books, or if you're wanting to introduce a budding artist to Book Arts, then by all means, this could be the book for you. It is by far better than the first book I ever bought on the subject -- but it wasn't a good use of money for me at this point."
2,Oh well.....they all can't be fives..,"If you already own another bookmaking book don't bother. If you're looking for your first book on making books....do a search for the book ""cover to cover"" buy it. Read it. They come back and decide if you really want this one."
5,One of the books you can read more than once in your life,"This is one of that amazing books you'll never get tired reading. The not so incredible history of Oskar Matzerath is well marked in a real world where people is not good or evil at all, they are only people in his time and circumstances, nor heroes neither villaines."
3,Four skirts,"It is usually said that this book is one of the masterpieces of the twentieth century,but allow me to disagree.The Tin Drum is entertaining and well written and the author strongly wants to impress and even shock his readers.It's a book about a very dark period of european history,maybe the darkest of all,but Grass doesn't want to plainly describe the atrocities of Second World War and the poverty of the subsequent period.He wants to give us a metaphorical fairytale,full of meanings that should stay longer in mind than the usual description of nazis and lagers,he wants to give us the full idea of caos,in which nothing can be judged too easily.Maybe he's a bit too ambitious,because he risks to miss something.The habit of repetition,of focusing on the mighty features of Oskar's extraordinary life can end up being boring,or also irritating.Even if the description of the four skirts of the grandmother Anna is really beautiful.In the end,sorry for my bad english!"
4,TOO COMPLICATED FOR ME.. however...,"i got through it just a few hours ago.. took more than 3 days, and let me tell you.. these 15 year old had a hard time. i tried to look for symbolism but couldnt find any.. even with the witch (black as pitch)... wondering also how the german version of that song would rhyme as well (made up probably). someone help me! i just dont see it.. all i see is a story and i perceive it only as a story about a boy who grows up in germany around the existance of nazism and WWII... his struggles with many frequent deaths of friends and family.. does that say anything... i have to think about it.. read this book if you intellectual type otherwise put it off till you gain more knowledge of the history of germany and the nazis which i have... but still have no idea.. It is however very humorous and creative.. for what purpose..? ( )"
4,Surrealism in prose,"Long, massive, exhaustive narrative of the life of Oscar Matzerath, an eccentric boy who at the age of 3 decides he will no longer grow and ""drums"" his feelings and passions by means of a drum. He is not a normal character, but rather a means through which G.Grass, using extensive obscure symbolism, repulsive fantasies, surrealism and metaphors, expresses the horrors of German/Polish society during the reign of nazism. O.Matzerath in fact is bizare, absurd, grotesque, and disturbing. G.Grass is a master of skilful prose revealing the poet writer as well, in a baroque/rococo style which intoxicates the reader. The book is not pleasant reading, with schoking passages. Deceptive in terms of expectations for a Nobel Prize winner. If you are willing to endure the challenge of reading ""The Tin Drum,"" take your chance!"
1,"unreadable, like most of the work of this writer","I have never understood the carryings on about Gunther Grass. I am a scholar of German literature and I've always found Grass just about unreadable, except for the novelle CAT AND MOUSE (Katz und Maus). The work has always struck me as somehow fascinated by the very fascism it wants to decry, and this novel is but another example of Grass' strange and -- as we know now -- unexpressed guilt-ridden post-ww2 narration. Sorry, folks, but you're better off with the equally insane writer Peter Handke, himself a problematic political figure, but he writes with integrity and unflinching honesty, and frankly, he's a better writer, as is the underrated (in this country at least) Heinrich Boll."
1,amazing,"this book really did change my adolescence - it made me see that choosing to not grow up was a metaphysical choice and a viable on at that - oskar pays the price but i won't - we learn from his mistakes (ps see ""Cat and Mouse"" by the same author to find out more.)"
2,"self destructive, no?","The tin drum is an equitius of time and place. The produilents of the charicters in each seguimanal are, for the most part mild to fair in their ability to ammuse the reader. I found this book short of a novel, yet it frounged my thoughts when I was away from it. The embasititorial in the closing is quite amusing and will be enjoied by the reader. This book is full of pertious twists and turn. A must read for all of those who enjoy disconfort and pledaguin."
5,Renewing a pleasant read from 30 years ago,I read this German clasic over 30 years ago and enjoyed it more the second time. I'm.in the process of re-reading classics that gave me pleasure years ago and find that a very rewarding experience. My last re-read was Catcher in the Rye which I had first read a good 50 years ago and found it as pleasurable now as it was then. I'm 85 years old and look forward to many wonderful re-reads.
3,"Entertaining, educational but tedious...","The Tin Drum gives a portrait of a bizarre man in an insane asylum in Germany, who seems to have supernatural gifts to see through those around him. He is bizarre, grotesque and interesting, but for me the whole tale did not come together as a whole. I found myself waiting for something, but found only one little tale tied weakly to another little tale. Each were interesting, and just a little out of whack, but never came together as a whole. I'm glad that I read this portrait of Germany around WWII, but sadly, I'm glad I'm finished."
2,Metaphorically challenged...,"I just finished this novel this evening and have to admit it was one of the more painful experiences that I have had in the last little while. The metaphor of a stunted Oskar (a metaphor for Weimar and Nazi Germany) who is the perpetual three year old grew tiresome rather quickly. Grass never normalizes his character in the face of the absurdity of the Nazi regime. He is absurd even in this totally absurd world. If he had been more normalized it would have been much more interesting, because it would show that in Nazi Germany even the deformity of the eternal three year old does not stand out, because it is all theatre. What was interesting about the novel was the loss of identity that Oskar felt (much like Germany itself in the Adenauer aftermath of the 1950's)when he gave up his drum. Why Grass was given the Nobel Prize is beyond my ken."
5,"Great symbolic book, but what does it all mean?","Yes, this is a lengthy book to slog through, but it is thoroughly enjoyable and completely unpredictable. The general plot has been told by other reviewers, so it will not be noted here. The chapter titles alone are enigmatic enough to keep you reading. My big question is what does it all mean? I'm sure the academic literary types have had a field day with this colossus! The tin drum is one HUGE, book-long symbol of what a person needs to get through life, I suppose... A very intellectual, compelling read for those patient enough to do so..."
4,Very Good,The first time I watch this movie I didn't get it. Then I bought it at the flea market for a buck. I watch it yesterday and enjoyed it. It was very good. It left out a detail that i wanted to know. Why was Kevin so mean to her when she took cared of him and his mama. I know because of the race thing but a detail is still missing to me. All in all very good movie.
3,mama floras family critique,"didnt think i would like this as much as i did, even got my sister liking it and she bought a copy, we both like it much better than we expected."
1,Mama Flora`s Family,"I very disappointed because I saw the movie on TV and wanted to add it to my video collection. But the video I ordered did not have the whole movie on it and I think you should have made it clear that I was not getting the whole movie and then I would have ordered the cd if it had the whole movie on it. This was not good business, I wll never order anything from you again. And I told my friends and family not to order from you either.Mrs. Hall"
1,"This is not a DVD for the NBC show airing TBS, Mama's Family",This is not a DVD for Mama's Family.Aired 1983-1990.
5,Great product,Excellent product. Great story lines. Brought back a lot of fun memories of watching many of them the first time.
3,Service Good - Quality Bad,"We remember ""The Commish"" fondly and sought to add this to our DVD library. The service was excellent but the quality of the DVD set was defective. I was disappointed that a replacement was not offered, only a refund."
4,Excellent police drama,"The Commish is one of my all time favorite police dramas. We watched it when it was on tv and were glad to see it out on dvd. Michael Chiklis does a great job portraying a serious police official, who is also a loving family man. There is plenty of action, heart-warming moments and a few comedic elements, also."
4,The One That Started It All ... For Better or Worse,"This marks the beginning of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. For me, the first four ""Friday the 13th"" films are the only ones worth watching. This one is one of the better entries. It helped cement the popularity of the slasher genre during the early 1980s. It also starred Kevin Bacon before he got really famous is ""Footloose"". Everyone has to start somewhere! This is simply a fun movie to watch. Sure, there's plenty of cheese and the movie is not very original. And I always found Mrs. Voorhees chatting to herself in Jason's voice to be way goofy. But there are some real scary moments as well. Plus some good gore effects. Plus, it has that nutty bicycle guy who appeared in the first two ""Friday the 13th"" films. Turn off your brain for a little while and enjoy!"
3,"Nothing high-art, but still entertaining.","I first saw this when I was about 13 or 14. Whilst it's no Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street, it's still a worthwhile piece of horror entertainment. The remote woodland backgrounds and the shabby holiday camp provide an excellently atmospheric setting. Unfortunately, most of the characters are either sex-mad, drug-taking teenagers or stereotype adults. The only character who comes across as either sympathetic or believable is the deranged Mrs Voorhees. Still, this film never pretends to be high art, and the ending is first-rate."
2,Nothing new here,"Not much to say. How many retarded teenagers do we have to watch get wiped out before the story actually starts? I'm being generous with 2 stars. There were a couple of jolts but this movie didn't offer anything that wasn't done much better in the ""Halloween"" series. Gore alone does not a story make. If I'm in the mood to watch slasher movies, Halloween I & II do it just fine."
2,The splatter genre is born,"Friday The 13th is a poor film (though miles ahead of later entries) which follows a group of teenagers as they try to reopen an old summer camp, Camp Crystal Lake. After being warned by an old man of the horrors of the camp ground in the past, the teens start reopening it anyway. One by one they are slaughtered, until help at last arrives...or does it? The killer is revealed, as a bates-ish type killer, and the film really picks up. A somewhat surprising end is in store for those who manage to make it clear through the film. A Twilight Zone-ish tag is added to the end as well.The main problem this film faces is it's utter cheapness; in writing and budget.I suppose I should mention Kevin Bacon is in this, but by no means makes the film any more watchable.This film barely deserves the 2 star rating I have bestowed upon it (it's more like a 1 1/2 star film), but later entries are worse, so I had to give it more than just 1 star."
3,The best of the series...but thats not saying much...,"Friday the 13th is good for a slasher flick, but isn't all that great alone. BUT, it IS the best of the Friday the 13th series. It's not just kill, kill, kill from beggeinng to end like the sequels are. It actually has some substance to it. Yet it is not the ""funnest"" of the series. The sequels are more enjoyable to watch. Reccomended if you like early-80's slashers."
2,A good flick when you're bored.,"Friday The 13th. . . I first watched this movie 2004. Yup, waited that long. Of course, I read reviews and did my 'research'.Well, for starters, don't believe any of the hype about the movie. Yes, it was probably scary compared to the movies of it's time. But now a days, it's a boring flick, with poor murder scenes, and unrealistic blood/injuries.Basically, Camp 'Blood' is re-opening, and so on Friday the 13th, the counselors get murdered one by one. It's a predicatable plot, up to who the murderor is.The only thing it really has going for it is the basic interest of who gets murdered when. Don't get me wrong. If I was reviewing this movie when it first came out, it might have received 5 stars. But compared with the films of today, it's a low-throttled slasher film, only worth watching when you're bored. Don't expect to see believable murder scenes or terror incarnate. if so, this film is not for you."
4,Psycho killer.,"Friday the 13th is wickedly delicious. The twist ending is definitely the sole reason to watch this '80s classic. Look for a young Kevin Bacon, let's just say he doesn't have a huge part, hint hint! The formula still works, love-sick teenagers get killed one by one at a remote camp and who exactly is the killer? You may be surprised, I highly recommend this cool purchase. Enjoy!"
5,The First is always the best!!,"FRIDAY THE 13TH was the best of the series with a young Kevin Bacon, Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees.I just watched part 6 the other day it is the only Movie in the series next to the first one that actually have kids come to the camp before all the camp staff gets killed.Plus the first one was the most realistic out of the series until when JASON comes back to life.Even though Betsy Palmer was short lived in the series (Part 1) there is no doubt this the best movie in the series.I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!"
5,The first one was effective,"The original holds its own. The grainy dark camera work,dim lighting, and rainy atmosphere give the film an eerie feeling. The murder scenes were shocking the first time I viewed them and I still think they hold up. The music is ok...I find it very similar to Bernard Herman's string arrangment in ""Psycho"". As far as ""Friday the 13th"" borrowing from Italian ""Giallo"" horror films, thats fine with me. Italian horror films suffer from bad acting and poor direction. ""Friday the 13th"" fares better on both these points. Great scary film on a low budget...thats the best way to make'em."
3,Don't go in the woods,"6 teens fixing up a cursed old summer camp get hacked up when a former cook takes revenge for the drowning death of her son. Slasher legend is very entertaining and tamer than advertised. The worse the execution, the better it seems. Bad special effects and bad acting are the key eliments in this film."
3,"The movie is great, but the DVD sucks!!!","What a bunch of crap. I hate paramount! They have, perhaps the most popular horror movie of the past 20 years and what do they do when they put it on a DVD? ---> add a trailer and release it... What a bunch of crap. All the other classics are getting special editions and having tons of extras, but all of us Friday the 13th fans get is a trailer. Do not buy this DVD! You are wasting your money! Just get the VHS version..."
3,this movie is pretty cool!,It's about camp that got shut down because of 2 murders in 1957.every attempt to reopen it lead to bad luck.the next try to open it met with murder that spawned countless sequels! I addmet that it is a little boring.it has a lot less substance than gore.on the+ side it was unpredictably who the killer is! a great bet for gore lovers1 END
1,Uncut but unnecessary,It`s unbelievable with which tactics the studios and the DVD companies make their money. The special features might be an improvement (haven`t seen them yet) but on the other hand you must be very familiar with the R-rated version to see any differences between the two. There are some small snippets in there which are only a few seconds long and which aren`t that great to waste another 12 $ on the movie because it`s labeled uncut. So if you have the R-rated one spend your money on a true uncut film and not on some halfassed uncut version.
4,Good movie,"I don't think I've ever seen any Friday 13th movies growing up. But I did hear about them. Walmart had a sale on the Friday 13 movie in Oct. I like scare movie's so I jumped on buying the first three. I have so many dvd's that I just got around to watching the first movie today. I enjoyed it, but hate watching movies that are pitch black and all you can see is a few lights. I don't know if it was my flat scene tv or the movie. But those parts sucked."
5,A Great Start!!,"Camp Crystal Lake has had its share of history. In 1957, a young boy drowned due to lack of supervision. In 1958, two counselors were mysteriously slain. After all this, the camp finally closed down for good. Or so some thought.""The real draw is makeup F/X man Tom Savini, the Michelangelo of mayhem."""
5,A New release of Friday the 13th (1980),I was a little disappointed with this DVD as it has only 12 seconds more than the first release of the 80 movie. The movie anyway is very good and it's a good product for the fans of the series because it has new extras and it's very interesting.
4,Friday the 13th,"Good slasher movie that started all the series worth watching and really enjoyed the drama,good transfer,worthwhile collection to dvd library"
4,This is quite the thrill ride.,"A little different than Halloween and The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th is a new take on teen horror. It isn't as good as its predecessors, but it is original and full of thrills and chills. The villain is utterly unexpected. Another thing that is neat is that you are constantly in shock over which of the campers is the main character, so you never know who will live and who will die. The death scenes are inventive and not cheesy or stupid in any way. This is a definate must see if you are into the horror genre."
4,Truly scary and entertaining!,"One of the best slasher flick I have ever seen has the killer being a woman not a man takes place at a camp were the killers kid, JASON was left for dead."
1,SUCKIE MOVIE!,"Was this movie supposed to be gorry? Cuz guess what? It wasn't. It was sOoOoOo cheesy! It was so stupid it was funny! I don't know what the whole movie has to do with Jason! I would really reccomend these following horror movies to you: Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), Freddy Vs. Jason, and Thirteen Ghosts."
1,"A ""HalloweeN"" copycat!","I have to admit, this is probably one of the most frightening horror flicks of the 80's but i mean, come on! They copied John Carpenter's Halloween! A psychopathic killer terrorizing a bunch of kids! If you want to get the 'good' scary feeling of a movie, rent or buy Halloween before you see Friday the 13th, you'll know what I mean."
3,Scratched to hell and back,"I was really looking forward to getting this set in the mail because Im a big Friday the 13th fan...However when it arrived in the mail today I opened it up and EVERY SINGLE DISC WAS SCRATCHED!!!!! It looked as if Freddy Krueger personally scratched every disc himself. I better get my money back from this purchase!! These DVD's are completely unwatchable the scratches are so deep, there's no way they'd play all the way through without any skipping...I should have listened to the other 1 star reviews on this set...DAMN IT!!Little bit of an update! I have watched every single movie in the set and there was NO SKIPPING!! Still pissed about the scratches But it didn't affect the usability of the discs so I'm bumping this review up from a 1 star to a 3 star to be fair."
5,Uncut and Unpacked!!,"Hi there, I've seen this movie several times on tv but never on blu-ray. The shipment is all right although a little plastic piece inside it was broken, I guess because for the delivery, anyways, I don't still the movie, hopefully this weekend it will be a bloody friday."
2,Bloody Genesis,"I'm 24 and grew up on these movies. They're perfect for teenagers, all the sex and blood. I will always consider these fun to watch. I have a soft spot for exploitation. That's not to say though that this is a good movie. It starts off pretty good, setting up Camp Blood and everything, but Cunningham doesn't have much directorial flair. This one's pretty dead. Basically no character development. Even things of marginal interest, like Alice and Steve's relationship, are only suggested and then dropped. One thing I noticed watching it this time around was that they really fouled up on the heroine. She's really bland, and they would've done better making one of the other girls the heroine.Now the film is iconic, has some memorable images, a great location, and is atmospheric. It's too bad there wasn't more intelligence behind it."
4,THIS IS A GREAT DVD!,"Paramount has done an outstanding job with this 1980's low budget slasher. the transfer is close to perfect. the colors are new, vibrant and solid, there is hardly any speckling, and there is no grain or bleeding at all. The movie looks like a new release thanks to the transfer. the sound quality is pretty good, and the only extra is a trailer. this movie is a must for any DVD collection. Great transfer!Movie: BImage: ASound: B-Extras: C-"
4,Great Stalk/Slash Movie,"I heard a lot about this movie from my friends, so I finally got a copy and checked it out. Overall it's a great stalk/slash movie which has basically no plot, but very original deaths. Keep in mind that stalk/slash movies are to be watched for the blood, gore, and T&A, not the plot. Some parts in this movie are very scary, escpecially the end. Too bad no one makes this type of movie anymore. This movie, however, does contain some bad acting as do many other 80's horror movies, which pushes it back to B-Movie Cinema.Positives - Very Bloody and Orginal deaths, Good scares, Overall great stalk/slash movie.Negatives - Bad acting"
3,Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th,"In the late 1970's and early 80's, the Horror genre rocked the world with movies like Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th. It is about camp counselers deciede to open a camp up after 22 years. The year before, a boy named Jason Voorhees drowned in the camp's lake. Then, someone starts commiting murder again and again. The killer begins to go after counselers like Alice(Adrienne King), Bill(Harry Crosby), and Jack(a young Kevin Bacon). Could it be Jason back from his watery grave?! I thought that this was a great example of a Horror, although I think that the amount of gore should have been cut and although I think that Halloween series is better than the Friday the 13th series, I still think that this movie is pretty good. Don't watch, especially, Parts 5 and 8! The only parts that I do recommend are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6!"
4,A horror classic,"Friday the 13th is a good movie, although it probably would be better if it hadn't been followed by nine mediocre-to-bad sequels. By itself, however, the first installment of the franchise is pretty original. There are some good gory offings for the splatter fans out there and the infamous twist ending is still cool even by today's standards. The DVD picture quality is alright, however the sound would have benefited greatly from a 5.1 surround remixing. There are also no special features to speak of except a really bad trailer. Interviews with the now unknown cast (except Kevin Bacon, of course) would have been interesting at least, if not deleted scenes or something. I'm sure Paramount will come to their senses one of these days. They've been showing some improvement with the more recent Friday movies at least! :)"
5,Friday the 13th: THE BEST HORROR MOVIE EVER!!!!,"Even though Jason isn't in this one, It's very scary!!! Evryone knows the stroy, but i'll say it anyway. It's about a 10 year old boy who drowns at Camp crystal lake. Non of the conserlers were watching, so he died. Now years later, he's supposedly come back. By coming back, he curses his mom to kill all the new conserlers who are there. All this on the worst night of the year, FRIDAY THE 13TH!!!!!!"
3,Not as good as I thought,"This was an okay film. I thought it was going to be the best, because the first films in series are all ways the best but I was wrong. The third film will all ways be the ""real"" first movie. Thats the first one that can actully scare you, the frist one with Jason and his mask, and the first one with amazing kills. I recomend this, I just liked most of the sequels better."
3,The one that created 9 sequels.... (SPOILERS),"The one that spawned one of the longest lasting horror film series and created the slasher flick.Camp crystal Lake has been shuttered for over 20 years.Bill Christy attempts to reopen the camp,despite a local death curse and the camp's nickname ""Camp Blood"". However,soon everyone will learn to fear this place,because somebody wants revenge for the death of a loved one,and they are VERY brutal.Not a bad film for an independent film by Sean Cunningham and a Friday the 13th that didnt have Jason(the Undead killer from the sequels),but still doesnt quite live up to films like John Carpenter's far superior ""Halloween"".Creative Murders.Good Rental but not worth buying (unless you buy the whole series)."
3,The film that started a sensation isn't all that sensational,"Featuring some beautiful (albeit nasty) effects by Tom Savini and a memorable score by Harry Mancini, Friday the 13th will forever serve as a reminder of the golden age of gore. The first (but certainly not last) of it's kind, the film relishes in it's own exploitation. It's the standard fare: teenagers, alone at a summer camp, smoke pot, play Monoploy, have sex, and die... all except for one... it's that unlucky person's job to run around, find all the other bodies, and fight the killer. What this film really has going for it is an excellent sense of paranoia and claustrophobia. It's 'who dun it' motif is very well executed and it has one ofthe most memorable endings since Carrie. All-in-all, Friday the 13th is good entertainment and provides a few good scares. Still, it's a movie best seen once and then left alone."
3,Average JOE!!!,This movie has a nice concept to it but was poorly done. Might of been better if there was a bigger budget and not so stupid of teens.
2,Pretty bad...,"K, this movie was short so i cant really say it dragged on too much, but there was too much mystery and not enough horror. I liked the ending, and the whole concept of the movie is cool (Jason having drowned in 1957, his mother getting revenge, then in the sequels Jason comes back), but thats the problem, I can tell you the whole story in one line and theres only 2 scenes that made me get scared a bit...(Arrow scene, and Jason in the water...). But, I've seen worse movies that this so I give it 2 stars. This one was bad, but it is a horror classic, and has a good plot, just not a good script."

I'm gonna gradually rent the whole series and right reviews...(hopefully the movies will get better)"
4,A Classic in the Genre of Horror (4.5 stars),"The first of 10 Jason Voorhies slashers is the best in the catalog. It features a group of young teenagers that head to an abandoned Camp to set up and get ready to run Camp Krystal Lake for the first time in several years. One by one, they're stalked by an unknown, violent killer.This film has just what you're looking for as it carries suspense, dumb laughs and blodd spillage.It is one of the better slasher flicks and is highlighted by the scene where one of the young women is searching in a bathroom for someone (i won't give it away), and it's absolutely terrifying, shocking ending when you think it's all over.Overall, if you're a horror fan addict, this is a must see. It may not scare you, but it provides plenty of good entertainment."
5,FRIDAY THE 13th SERIES BEGINS,"Here we go the series begins with Jasons mother slaughtering everyone because of his death and them not paying enough attention to him. What a way to begin the series. But wait till the next 9. Freddy is not as good as Jason, neither is Michael.Go out and by the series... Now!!!"
3,Great sleep over flick!,"I have grown up with the Friday the 13th movies, I always watched them at slumber parties and stuff like that. Watching the original makes me nostalgic. It's probably one of the better ones in the series.The film doesn't have a lot of plot but some of the scenes are quite chilling, especially the creepy bathroom scenes ""chh chh chh ha ha ha"". The acting by the unknown teen cast is just passable, some of the dialogue is kinda cheezy, but it is worth sticking around for the 15 minute finale alone. It is my favourite part of the whole movie when Betsy Palmer delivers her unforgetable, over the top performance as Mrs Voorhees. Its funny how you watch a bunch of amateurs acting for most of the movie and then along comes Palmer, she has more talent in her little finger than the rest of the cast put together, pity she wasn't given a bigger role, she deseves more.I like Halloween much better but this is pretty good, I will always have a place on my shelf for Friday the 13th."
2,A flawed classic...,"friday the 13th is well-known or even a classic in its genre and i have searched for the vcd for a long time. too bad it does not meet my expectation. in fact, everything is not what i have expected, it lacks suspense, surprises and chasing which are the rules for a successful slasher flick. comparatively though it is unfair to do so, scream (1996) redefines the genre and fulfils all those requirements and it rocks as a result.the final twist is surprising and saves the film from getting a failure. the only reason to watch the sequels is to find out whether jason, the long dead son of the crazed alice would return."
2,it is a copy of halloween.,"WHEN FRIDAY THE 13TH WAS RELEASED THE PROBLEM WAS THAT YOUNG KIDS HAVE HAD PROBLEMS DEALING WITH THEIR ANGER. BUT IN 1980, THE HORROR FILM STARTED TO BECOME POPULAR AND THAT IS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE MOVIE. UNLIKE IT'S PRECEDORS THE MOVIE INTRODUCES THE CHARCATERS WITH FUNNY LIKE ANTEDOTES FROM OTHER HORROR MOVIES. CUNNIGHAM WHO DIRECTED THE MOVIE SAID THAT IT WAS A COPY OF HALLOWEEN BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT MOVIE AND IT WAS SOME SORT OF TRIBUTE BUT I TEND TO DISAGREE. WHILE THE MOVIE IS FUN IT IS ALSO INCREIDBLY STUPID AND DUMB. AND WE HARDLY SEE ANYTHING FROM BETSY PALMER(JASON'S MOTHER) UNTIL THE LAST 15 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE YET SHE GETS TOP BILLING. OH, BOY I LIKE IT AND THEN AGAIN I DIDN'T."
2,ek,"this didnt start anything slashers cant be stupid retarded moms.its just not scary ,its just a stupid mom kill her mommy kill her,OH MY GOD!wow so scary.if you ever think this movie is scary i wonder what you'll think when you see movies like pet semetary,the shining,and the landlady."
4,A GOOD MOVIE,"this is one of my favorite horror movies. it has a great plot, but the movie kind of drops at the end."
3,Not bad. There are some classic scenes!,"Friday The 13th tells the story of a camp on Crystal Lake. Back in the 1950s a young boy named Jason drowns and killings follow at the camp. In 1980 the camp is desided to be reopened. A whole bunch of counselors come. But during a terrible storm all whole bunch of killings occur. Some say it copies Halloween. No it doesnt, but it does use some of the technique from Halloween. This really isnt all that good. It has a decent plot and acting. But itsn all that fun. But once it gets going it gets much better. Rated R for violence, gore, sex, and nudity."
4,a great horror film,"I don't think this should be rated r. I saw this when I was 11. Well, some parts should be rated r but it wasnt that gruesome just surprising. Though not a good plot it will keep you on your seat and watch out for the ending."
5,Classic Movie,I've watched FRIDAY THE 13TH and I really enjoyed the movie considering it came out in 1980.(I was just starting junior high when it came out) I have been a big fan of JASON (I know he wasn't in the first one except a flashback as a child) and I've been waiting forever for the rumored FREDDY VS JASON movie. I have the entire collection of FRIDAY THE 13TH and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET MOVIES plus many other horror movies. Any way check out the movie.
4,A bit cheesy but then it did have 8 sequels,"Friday the 13th may be regarded a classic, but this first installment of a bloody legacy, I find, is not the best. Jason is only a boy in this and we learn his schitzophrenic mother is the killer. I found this film a bit slow and dull in places and I now hear that a 10th film is in production, marking the 20 years since this original film."
3,Friday the 13th isn't that bad,"This is the first film in the neverending horror franchise. It's also the most entertaining of the bunch. Six camp counselors at cursed Camp Crystal Lake are systematically stalked and slaughtered by an insane killer. But it's not Jason, he doesn't show up till Part 2, as the viewers of SCREAM well know. It's macabre fun guessing how they are going to get murdered, and no two killings are alike. The gore effects and suspense level are excellent, despite a nonexistent budget. Check it out!"
3,"""Friday the 13th"" A Suprising Treat","Just about everyone I've spoken to on the issue of horror movies has told me what a terrible film ""Friday the 13th"" was. What a surprise then, when I actually found myself enjoying it when it came on cable one rainy night. Granted, the movie lacks logic and originality, but overall, I thought it was a fairly entertaining, suspenceful horror film, that I can honestly compare to John Carpenter's classic ""Halloween."""
1,"Review This Format ONLY, Not The Film","""Friday The 13th"" is a harrowing film. It has long been on my top ten list. I see no evidence that this film will EVER be removed from that list.Having said that: I see NO difference between the Special Edition DVD and the Blu Ray transfer. I have 1080 and more HDMIs than I know what to do with. I have a state of the art blu ray player and a brand new plasma television. So to interject statements about how I ""need the right equipment"", is rubbish.DO NOT waste your money on this edition. It offers NOTHING that the Special Edition DVD does not offer, other than an eighty percent cost difference."
4,a great horror movie,"This is a great horror movie, STRICTLY horror movie though, it isnt very thought provoking however, and the violence and gore is a consistant theme that runs througout the movie, however it is still a good creepy movie to watch!"
3,Don't listen to the critics!,"""Friday the 13th"" is a typical slasher from the early 80's, only it's better than most. Despite critics, like Roger Ebert and Lenorn Maltin giving it ridicuosly low ratings, it really isn't as bad as they claim. In fact, the scripting, at least, is every bit as good as that of ""Halloween""'s, only it isn't as well made and certainly not as original. Almost everyone knows the plot-line, even those who have never seen it, so I won't bother on outlining it. And if you are familiar with it, then you know what just about every ""Friday the 13th"" is about."
3,Everybody Knows His Name,"I have to say if you've seen one you've seen them all. However, all sequels must start with an original. Friday the 13th is probably the most well known horror movie in existence. No matter how old you are I'm sure you've heard of Jason Voorhees. As a child, Jason drowned in the ever famous Camp Crystal Lake when camp counselors decided to take care of their own needs instead of Jason's. Now, still haunted by the memory of her son's death is Jason's mother. She'll see to it that she gets her revenge. The original Friday the 13th is unique from the rest of it's nine sequels in that Jason is not the one doing the killing. We don't see Jason until the very end of the movie. The story is good enough to keep you interested, but everyone knows why they watch Friday the 13th and that is for the bloodshed. If your a horror fan, like myself, Friday the 13th is a must in any horror collection."
3,"OK, BUT A LITTLE DATED","THIS 1980 HORROR SLASHER FLICK IS ABOUT A KILLER WHO BEGINS MURDERING INNOCENT TEENS AT A CAMP NAMED CRYSTAL LAKE. THIS MOVIE IS KINDA SLOW MOVING AT TIMES, BUT, IT'S STILL ENJOYABLE. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE KILLER YOU SEE IN THIS MOVIE IS NOT JASON. JASON DOESN'T APPEAR UNTIL THE SEQUEL. THIS 1980 CLASSIC IS WORTH A WATCH IF YOU WANNA SEE A GOOD OLD FASHIONED SLASHER MOVIE. THIS MOVIE INSPIRED WAY TOO MANY SEQUELS AND AN UNRELATED TV SHOW OF THE SAME NAME."
5,"Like the last guy said, the original and best","Some good old fashioned campout fun....with a psycho killer on the loose. Besides you get to see a young Kevin Bacon before his career really took off. ALSO, you probably would have never guessed it but the character of Bill (the last guy to get offed) is played by Harry Crosby, son of famous singer Bing Crosby. I think everyone should see this at least ONCE."
3,"Friday the 13th, bit more like Tuesday the 10th","This movie is really overrated. It relies on gore to make it good but it lacks some other concepts like suspence and it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. It bored me and is too predictable, though I did like the trick they pulled at the end. Too be fair I'll give it three stars. If you like gory, sluggish, cavemen like horror movies you'll like it if you require a bit more pass on this one."
3,jason is spawned!,"a bunch of delinquent brats toss little jason into the water.his camp counselors are busy screwing and he drowns.his mother goes crazy and starts wasting people all over crystal lake.later in the series,jason takes over.its in the middle of a greatest friday the 13th movies list.the kid getting killed was horrible.i hate it when they waste kids in movies.this is the one that started it all!"
3,One of the Best Slashers there is! (Besides Halloween.),"Friday the 13th is a great film. It (with the help of John Carpenter's Halloween,) set the stage for the modern horror slashers we see today.The acting is good, with an original setting, and a killer which is mysteriouis as well as scary.I give it 5 out of 5 stars."
2,"Raved as a genre success, but not as good as presumed","Friday the 13th (1980) Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Jeannine Taylor, Kevin Bacon, Mark Nelson, Robbi Morgan, Peter Brouwer, Walt Gorney, D: Sean S. Cunningham.Palmer is the most effective thing, who puts in a climactic appearance only for a quick payday to buy herself a car (!), in this moneymaking chiller as a vengeful killer hunting sex-crazed counselors at woodsy Camp Crystal Lake. (You reckon there was even a script written or a screenwriter named Victor Miller?) Makeup artist Tom Savini's realistic gore effects are the only ticket. Film gave birth to a new horror icon that later turns up in the sequel. Countless, mimicking sequels follow.Running Time: 93 minutes and rated R for gore, violence and some nudity."
2,"Pardon the pun, but this is a hack job.","Silly, by-the-numbers slasher flick concerning a bunch of teen counselors who are pursued by a crazed killer at camp Crystal Lake. Lots of gore and a high body count, but not an ounce of suspense or tension. It also spawned countless sequels that aren't much better than this mess. This DVD gets an extra star for its camp value and because it evokes memories of those glorious 1980s. Otherwise, this hack job (no pun intended) is totally negligible."
3,Not a patch on Halloween but...,"With the emergence of gory slasher flicks which was Halloween (1978), it was only a matter of time before [...] flicks were introduced. Sure enough, Sean S Cunningham comes out with a slasher dream, Friday the 13th. The storyline is mediocre- a group of camp councillors reside at Camp Crystal Lake. One by one, they are knocked off realising there's someone else at the lake who is hellbent on ensuring they stay clear of the area. The penalty for trespassing is death! Unlike Halloween, Friday the 13th relies heavily on gore, a good idea at the time as eighties horror fans would have been pleased by this much to the disgust of film censors at the time.While this cannot compare to Halloween, Friday the 13th is still quite scary with excellent creepy music from renowned composer Harry Manfredini. This introduced the whole idea of 'who is the killer' in film and that's another reason to keep watching. Is Jason alive? Or is there another more sinister force at work?"
4,A great horror film from the 80's,"This is one film that started all the other flicks to come like the overrated scream, I know what you did last summer, valentine, etc. People that say that this movie is not suspenseful or creepy , have watched too many modern horror flicks. Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elmstreet are the only classics worth owning on dvd.It would have got a 5 star, but with the dvd not being unrated with no bonus material, it looses a star. Paramount really needs to redo the series in a nice ultimate edition box."
3,Not really entertaining,"Friday the 13th is a verry boring movie. I first watched it when I was 10 and even then I wasn't scared. Good FX, that must be said, but the only excitement comes almost an hour into the movie. Jack gets speared and Marcie gets an axe in her face. Alice sees all her dead friends and goes nuts. Then Mrs. Voorhees comes to the scene. First you will think that she is innocent, but she goes crazy after she tells the story about Jason. A great final (not as good as part 3)and then Mrs. Voorhees gets her head chopped off. 3 stars for the final, if the whole movie was as good as the final I would have given it 5 stars."
3,"If you survive, you'll wake up feeling groggy on Saturday","The simplest of all horror movie plots: 6 dumb, sex-crazed teens go into the woods but they don't come back.A summer camp with a history of tragedies is going to be re-opened by 6 teens who are hired to fix the place up. But a former cook who's son drowned some time before the story takes place decides that the camp should never be opened again and takes her revenge.Campy fun for the whole family! But, the video version is hampered by the death scenes being cut or cut short."
2,Very good - for curing insomnia,"A group of teenagers stay in a camp which has been re-opened again after many years and, one by one, are stalked and then killed by an unseen killer.Even for a slasher film this is pretty lame. The characters are all either so irritating or so stupid that we really couldn't care less what happens to them, completely defeating any kind of suspense or drama. The grief-plagued, enraged Mrs Voorhees comes across as the only interesting character and dominates her every scene.But the last fifteen minutes of this bore can't make up for the endless tedium leading up to it."
1,The movie doesn't nearly come close to Halloween,In my opinion Friday the 13th is filled with mindless gore and no plot except for killing teenagers who are having sex and shouldn't be. Don't even waste the time. Go see Halloween instead.The only reason I gave it one star is because I had to. It deserves none.
3,No New Footage...NOT UNCUT,"I loved this movie growing up and I purchased it immediately. After seeing it a zillion times in the past two decades I wanted to know what ""uncut"" footage was missing. I have also read about ""more gore in the deaths"" but sadly it is not here. This version has no new footage...no scene extensions...nothing. Its the same move as the 1980 release. What is amazing is the quality of the film...Blu-ray really shines here; you notice immediately the quality versus the grainy film of the past.For example: in the scene where Brenda goes to brush her teeth and Mrs Voorhees is in the ""shower"" staring at here and you see the curtain move with what looks like fingers...here you can actually see the fingers.Great film...excellent quality...disappointment on the ""uncut"" title...again nothing new here."
2,the best friday movie by far,ok i have to say this is a good horror but come on what a waste of time producing ten sequels especially jason x!.sean s cunnigham certanly knows how to copy other horrors.set in camp crystal lake (as are all the rest) basically well -dont have sex here!.halloween was the origanal and best and scary suspense!.this is made just for the sakes of making a horror moive.my friends thought it was total crap!.i give it 2 stars lets hope that there will be no more friday 13ths ever againthis is the best out of all the seriesbut still worthless n pointless
1,Don't bother!!,"I had bought the dvd set that came with the little mask at a local Best Buy and had to return it because the packaging it comes in causes the dads to scratch. I ordered this one thinking Paramount caught on and decided on better packaging. Unfortunately, no. I just ordered this 2 days ago, got it today, pulled out the dvds and surprise surprise they have noticeable scratches on them because of the packaging. Don't get me wrong, the packaging is cool ands gives great details about the movies, but I don't spend 40 dollars on scratched DVDs. They need a simpler packaging, where the dads won't be sliding on cardboard causing them to scratch. Hopefully somebody will catch on!"
1,Save your money!!!,"Back in October Paramount released the badly packaged ""Limited"" edition of the Friday The 13th series. The 8 discs came in a HORRIBLE cardboard case that scratched the DVD's. Complaints were everywhere from customers about this. When I saw this listed as a new release I thought that Paramount had the good sense to re-package the set after all the complaints and I placed my order...well, the new box set came today AND it's the same HORRIBLE cardboard case, minus the collectable hockey mask that came in the ""Limited"" edition. Save your money and stay away from this."
1,"in responce to ""in responce to silly"" it is a rip off","just like in respone to in responce to silly said it is a rip off you have to see both movies and you will see the simularitys halloween is a master piece but friday 13'th took the style and detailed scenes from it and copied it. some where i heard that even the director of friday the 13""th said he took the style of halloween just changed the scenery. and seeing through the eyes of a killer came from the begining scene from halloween but halloweens seeing through theyes of the killer was done verry gohstly, smoothly, better lighting, better music, and scarier."
2,classic...or something,"This film spawned the Jason icon. But, other than that, it's watered-down a bit for my taste. I saw this unedited for the first time not too long ago, and I was excited about experiencing the epic ""Jason mask"" for the first time! However, Jason doesn't emerge in the mask until,like, the third one. The main culprit in this first one is Jason's mother. Strange...and not as classic as the Jason Vorhees we all know and love. I suppose, by 80's horror film schlock standard, this film is mediocre. And, it has its place. But the down side is, it's not a Jason movie at all, so don't expect to see him."
1,FRIDAY THE 13TH 1-8 BEST HORROR MOVIES OF ALL TIME,PARAMOUNT JUST CANT DO A SPECIAL EDITION OF THE FRIDAY THE 13TH FILMS CAN THEY NO JUST A WIDESCREEN WITH MONO SOUND AND A THEATRICAL TRAILER ON ALL OF THE DVD MOVIES RELEASED IS THAT IT IS THAT ALL THEY'RE IS NO NO NO THIS IS ONE THE WORST RELEASED VERSIONS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE HOW CAN PARAMOUNT DO SUCH A THING LIKE THIS I KNOW AND ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT THEY JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FRIDAY THE 13TH FILMS ON DVD SO DO NOT BUY THEM I JUST HOPE THAT NEW LINE CINEMA BUYS ALL OF THEM SO WE WILL HAVE A REAL VERSION OF THE FRIDAY THE 13TH FILMS IN THX 5.1 SOUND
2,it is a copy of halloween,"Should this movie really be considered a horror classic? Or should it get an award for copying John Carpenter's Halloween. This movie did have it's moments but it does not take a genious to know that the whole idea of the movie and it's sequels were tooken from John Carpenter's Classic, Halloween. If you watch this movie and it's sequels they are no where near the halloween series. The whole series is filled with too much sex,drugs and gore. Not much suspense or scares. The only reason this junk gets two stars is because... well it copied such a good movie!"
2,"Just because it's was very popular and influenced many horror films, it's still stupid.","This is a very important film in the history of horror movies. It spawn many sequels and riff-offs. But it's still a bad movie. It isn't as bad as the sequels but there is no reason to see this stupid film. See Psycho, Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or The Evil Dead if you want to see a good horror film."
2,C-R-A-P,"Fun if you're in the mood for a few cheap thrills(and lame ones at that),but other than that it is worthless.A blatant knock off of John Carpenter's seminal classic ""Halloween"",but lacking it's vision,and style.If you've seen this one,you've seen ALL of the F-13 movies!"
2,Routine slasher flick,"Despite the ""fabulous"" and glowing reviews for ""Friday the 13th,"" I think it's a definite BOMB. It's the one that started the routine slash-'em-up horror flicks that are SO painfully obvious in recent horror/thrillers.It gets credit for gory special effects (the famous Kevin-Bacon-through-the-chest-with-an-arrowhead scene) and some campy fun. But what really drains it dry is the lack of true suspense (what ""Halloween"" and ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" were rich of), annoying theme music that seems like a steal between ""Psycho"" and ""Halloween,"" and the most obvious of them all is the lack of logical plot. Basically, it's unwatchable, unless you have the hots for a young, 20ish Kevin Bacon, who dons a Speedo and his bare bottom. To top it off, the movie is just plain ANNOYING.Rated R for gruesome violence/gore, sexuality, nudity, and for language."
1,ONE OF THE STUPIDEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN - I LOVE IT!,"""FRIDAY THE 13TH"" IN MY OPINION, IS A CORNY LOW BUDGET FILM THAT OVER THE YEARS HAS BECOME A CULT CLASSIC. SURE WE DON'T GET JASON UNTIL THE SECOND FILM, BUT YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THE FUN OF THIS FILM. SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THE MOVIE WAS WRITTEN BY HORRIBLE WRITERS. I THINK THEY PURPOSELY MADE IT THIS WAY. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SERIOUS PLOT SKIP THIS FILM. BUT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE YOURSELF A GOOD TIME, SEE THIS FILM."
3,Good enough; gets better towards the end,"This horror film is good enough by horror standards, with a bunch of camp counselors being stalked and attacked by an unknown assailant, one by one, until only one is left to discover who the killer is and what the motive is as well. And then, just when you think it's all over..............I won't say anymore."
1,"Classic Slasher films, absurd packaging!",I love the Friday the 13th movies. When i first saw this i thought it would have those smaller plastic cases that help protects the DVD's. But nope! they have absurd cardboard packaging which scratches the DVD's and two of my movies were defective and i had to return them to Amazon.com. So many manufacturers now days are lazy and cheap. Save your money! don't waste $40 on this! it's not worth it! TRUST ME!
3,The Beginning Of The Terror!!!,"I have decided to rewatch all the films and review each one. So if you like my review, check my history for all the reviews on each one.The film itself is great BUT only because its the first and I know more greats are to come. If this was a stand alone film I wouldnt have really cared for it. To understand the series its a must to watch if your a big fan of jason. Below are the pros and cons.Pros+Great Story+Early enough to where the acting was still good.+Good film length+Good gore killsCons-Not enough nudity-Not high in the ""re watch able"" dept.In the end, the film is a good film and a must to watch if your new to the series BUT I myself wont spend much time re watching it as much as the others."
4,A must see for any movie fan!,If you only see one of the friday the 13th movies make it pt 1. Even though this friday lacks the presence of jason it still remains my favorite of the series. This movie is set around a camp being reopened after a series of murders back in the 50's at the same camp. And as the new councelors work to rebuild the camp before its reopening they one by one meet the same fate as the councelors before them. I peticularly like this movie for the creepy camp setting and cool murder sequences. If your a horror fan this is a must see.
2,For Tom Savini's magic only,"... slasher fest about a group of niave councilors being slaughtered at an abandoned summer camp. Interesting premise ruined by B-grade performances, thin story and ham-fisted direction. Still, special make-up effects wizard Savinin does show some style and colour in the mutilations (especially Kevin Bacon's arrow-through-the-throat gag).The Paramount DVD edition of this movie is a disappointment to fans as far as extras go (theatrical trailer - bore), but a nice and neat 16:9 enhanced widescreen presentation and a clear and loud Dolby Mono track does make it satisfactory to the average horror buff."
3,a typical 80's horror movie,"Seven boys and girls visit a camp that has been closed due to a murder that took place many years ago.There intent is to work there for a week or so,but the boys and girls become intimate and this leads to a loss of virginity.As is the case with most horror movies,once a teen loses his/her virginity,he/she is destined to meet a painful death.Every murder in this film is differnt and creative which is why I give it 3 stars.The only scene in this movie that is half-way scary is the end where the girl is sitting in the boat.This movie can only seen once or twice because it is very disturbing.If you are looking for a movie that is scary and not very disturbing,watch Halloween,Fright Night,or Evil Dead."
3,A VERY GOOD WAY TO START A SERIES,"This film has 6 teens entering Crystal lake. The teens are counsllers thier. Each teen will get murdered by Jason's Mother, because Jason was a kid who drowned in the water and no one safed him because the counsellers where makeing love! Now the mother wants revenge! The survivor out of the teens kills Mrs. Vorsees by slashing here head! This film had some amtuery acting which was not a big factor here. They just got someone that could scream! Watch for Kevin Bacon in one of his first films."
3,Wes Craven could have done better,"friday was okay but i think that it could have been alot better. The death scenes were so slow that after five minutes you were actually wishing that the victims would die and just get it over with. I liked the remoteness of the camp. The end is pretty confusing. Slightly cliche. The last chase scene just drags on and on and on. Wes Craven could have done better.I do not suggest it for a night when you just want one good horror movie to watch, i suggest it for a night when you are going to watch lots of horror movies and this is just one of them."
4,a horror classic,friday the 13th is a definite classic in horror films.it has to be the whole woodsy kinda atmosphere.the acting couldve been better but you could change everything in the world and people would still critize it.jason is #1 best time of all cold blood killers.im still waiting for freddy vs jason to come out.....
3,Most popular slasher film!,"Since I've first seen this film, I loved it. The acting could be better, but I've seen alot worse. King, (Alice), played a good role."
2,agree with Deano and soundtrack question for anyone,"Hey I agree, not a whole lot of new stuff on this re-release. I did notice some non scary footage in the beginning when the killer is in the cabin looking in on the sleeping kids, more kids sleeping shots. wowee.the only thing I noticed that was a few seconds longer was Kevin B's death. didn't really notice much on anyone else. some other reviewer said that Marcy's axe in the face was longer. I didn't see the dif. Also my widescreen was Full Screen!! Does anyone know what the Vinyl Soundtrack that came out long time ago with the 3-D cover which includes music from parts one two and three worth? Can't find any info on it.So to sum up the new release, part one is okay, the extras kinda are lame and can anyone tell me what that nonsense forgotten tales segment was all about? looks like it was shot on video and doesn't belong. WT?"
3,Badly Made Horor movie,"Friday The 13th features bad acting, bad directing, bad script, bad cinematography, etc.Why do I give it 3 stars? Probably because Friday the 13th is what it is, no apologies required.In a age of political correctness this movie is a nostalgic breath of fresh air.This is a good mindless movie that is fun to watch on Halloween or just a rainy cold night when you are home alone. I watched it last night and started hearing noises around the house.... If you like this, get Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Halloween, they are about 20 times better than this. ... ."
3,Friday the 13th,"The first in the series. Counselers re-open Camp Crystal Lake, after the Jason Vorhees drowning. But someone tries to stop them... Jason's mom! Credible for being the first, Jason makes a apearence in the end. Jason's mom get decapitated...not as good as the other sequels."
1,A dreadfully insulting ripoff of Carpenter's Halloween.,"Friday the 13th is an awful movie because the few elements in the movie that arouse suspense and fear were simply ripped off of one of the greatest slasher's ever, Halloween. The movie is also an abomination because it inspired a whole genre of trash even worse than itself. If you want a good horror movie, see Psycho or Halloween or The Shining or Night of the Living Dead, but at all costs avoid this disgrace."
1,"Looks good, sounds good but it really stinks!",People are still wanting to see this dreadful chiller usually because of it's title but they do not know that it is a completely dull and boring film. I was one of those people but now I've suddenly reallised how bad it is. A bunch of teenagers with sex on their minds go camping at a place where two people got mudered in 1958 and the son of the murderer returns to chop 'em all up to bits. You can see a young Kevin Bacon and Betsy Palmer's head getting chopped off (in a grusomely memorable way) but that's about it.
4,The Uncut Friday...,"...version not previously available in the U.S. Wait a few years and there will be another previously unavailable in the U.S. ""Uncut"" version available only on Blu-Ray for an additional $25 because it is Blu-ray. I remember owning Friday the 13th on VHS. I finally bought the ""from Crystal Lake to Manhattan"" set a few years ago to accompany my ""Jason goes to Hell"" DVD (I even sprung for Jason X). However, I for one refuse to spend another $12 for something I already own, add a few, insignificant, seconds of someone bleeding. I must admit that I can't wait for the new Jason movie. Hell, I can't wait to see/own ""His name was Jason"", but these I will pass up. The FOUR STARS is for Jason and Co. ONE STAR for the re-re-re-re-re-release."
2,Not what I hoped it would be!,"This was actually pretty disappointing. While I felt, it had the potential to be so much more suspenseful than ""Halloween"", it just wasn't. I don't know what went wrong. The setting was a lot more frightening than ""Halloween"". Also, they could have spent more time developing the characters, even though they weren't very likable to begin with. This is especially true of Alice (Adrienne King). She was too whiney and not pretty enough to be a heroine. Kevin Bacon was probably the best out of all of them, so it's no surprise he's the only one still heard of. The ending, while exciting, still was a disappointment. I also felt that the violence did not add much to this movie. All in all, I'd give ""Friday the 13th"" 2/5. I'd actually recommend ""Friday the 13th: Part 2"" over this."
3,Worthy effort,"I personally disagree that this film is a rip-off of Halloween(the only real Halloween rip-off would the horrid ""Jason Goes To Hell-The Final Friday""). I found the film to be quite enjoyable.Tom Savini""s make-upFX are EXTREMELY cool and are a reason alone to watch this(Jack""s death and Ms.Voorhees demise are very cool to look at,as is Marcie""s death and perhaps Annie).The film falls a bit low on the scare factor,mainly because of the first-person view(it""s practically not scary at all that way!)The scariest scene is with- out a doubt when Jason pulls alice under the water.He looks so UGLY!(not as gross as in parts 4,7 and 8,but pretty close.)Overall,I think the film is enjoyable and a worthy addition to the world of horror.Oh,and one more thing-BE SURE to check out the make-upFX by Tom Savini.They seriou- sly rock! Rated R-contains gruesome violence and strong nudity."
1,Terrible!!!!!!,"Jason Voorhees mom was doing all the killing?Awful!!I could see why she killed the initial camp counselors.Because they were the ones who let Jason drown.But to go back like 20 years later and kill a bunch of new counselors for no reason is stupid. The sequels are just as bad. Put a pole in the DEAD Jason, and have lightening strike, and all of a sudden he's alive again. Dreadful!!!The Halloween movies are much better."
2,Welcome to Crystal Lake!,"The Crystal Lake Camp is about to be re-opened years after a double murder took place at the camp site. The local residents believe the camp ground is haunted and possessed by a lethal curse, and they therefore avoid it at all costs. Despite the local folklore, some young camp leaders decide to take a job there and help get the camp ready for the opening that is scheduled within two weeks. This is a dire decision, since the local legend has some validity and the curse is about to take its course. The audience is left with a rather gory and scary film, which creates a feeling of paranoia along with the feeling of being watched."
1,HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!,THIS MOVIE IS ONE THE WORST SLASHER FILMS OF ALL TIME!!!First of all jason isn't in it. And dialog is so bad it's funny.The only highlight of this movie is when jason's mother gets herhead chopped off. So don't waste you money on this one.
1,this movie sucks!,I thought it was going to be a lot better when I rented it but I guess I was wrong. I give every thing about this movie two thumbs down. If you want to see this and you think it`s going to be good then your wrong too. there is only three words that go with this movie DON`T SEE IT!
2,oh boy!,a completely ovious movie where teens get slashed to hash. a pointless movie about kids getting killed. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 star is because it does a good job on the blood.
5,SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Friday the 13th was a very good movie. I enjoyed all the suspense. It's about Jason drowning because people aren't watching him because they're doing........ stuff.......... well, you get it. Now his mom is going around and killing everyone. What a thriller!"
2,"OK MOVIE,TERRIBLE DVD","First off this DVD stinks,no extras just a lousy trailer,and bad sound,picture quality goes from good to downright awful at times.Now for the movie itself.Although this came out in 1980 by no means is this a ripoff at all. It is about a boy(Jason Voorhees)that drowned due to irresponible camp councilers. His mother Pamela Voorhees(played by Betsy Palmer)committed a series of murders the following 2 years after the drowning. Then 20 years later the camp is reopening,and the new people to Camp Crystal Lake are in for sheer terror. Awesome Death scene,especially killing Kevin Bacon off."
3,The movie that started it all...,"Steve Christie is trying to re-open a cursed camp to the public. He hires several counselors to help him prepare the camp for re-opening. Unbeknownst to them, a killer--it's not who you think it is--lurks.Among the cast in this film, look for Kevin Bacon. This was his second film in his acting career. Out of all the death scenes, I liked Kevin's scene the best--too bad there was a scene cut out in this R-rated cut.The special effects by Tom Savini are great--the murder scenes are very graphic and very well done.A good horror flick, but it gets boring at times. I pefer ""Friday the 13th, Part 2""."
4,Friday the Thirteenth,This flick great but not better than halloween. There is no special cast of actors in Friday the thirteenth.Story Line 9 1/2 of 10 Jason Vorhees drowned in Camped Crystal Lake while a bunch of conselors were fooling around so to speak. So strange murders start happening at camp crystal when it re-opens.This Flich has a strange ending so pay attention so you can fully enjoy it. I would suggest getting it but I feel the sequels are the better viewing choice. If you don't have a stomach for gore don't watch this.
3,"Great Film, Bad DVD...","Friday the 13th is easily my favourite film of the series, however to fully enjoy it, you simply must purchase either the Region 2 or 4 release from Warner Brothers. Where this DVD is the US Theatrical (Cut) version, the R2&4 DVD is UNCUT, has a Commentary and a Featurette. Not to mention that the picture and sound quality is superior to Paramount's ""efforts"".Avoid this DVD."
4,"Kill her Mommy, Kill her!","Though some might say this is B rated material, its still a damn good horror flick. even after 20 years it still scares and chills. Can anyone forget the last horrific scene where Jason makes his debute? the killings are some of the most inovated around and if the other classic Halloween hadn't beat Friday to the punch who knows how things might have turned out. this original first in the series is a must for any true horror fan or collector. As for the sequels, well some are better than others but I have to say that the level of suspense found in the first is pretty much a part of the rest of the films. Its mindless escapism with a chills thrown in but thats what makes such films iresistible."
3,Decent Halloween knock-off.,"Though admittedly a HALLOWEEN clone and certainly a B movie on many levels, F13 is actually pretty scary. It genuinely evokes the age-old fears of the dark and of isolation without being condescending to the audience. Sure, the characters are of the cookie cutter variety(including a young Kevin Bacon), not allowing for any great amount of audience sympathy. However, the campground setting and Harry Manfredini's eerie score go a long way toward setting up an atmosphere of malevolence and foreboding. Tom Savini's spfx are top-notch and certainly not for the faint of heart. The ending is pretty shameless but don't let that deter you from seeing this film. It just might provide you with some chills on a cold, rainy day."
3,Gives a Good Scare,"The first installment of the Friday the 13th movies was really not as good as the 2nd, in my opinion, but it was good nontheless. I don't know what it was. This movie was creepy, though. The scene in the jeep, the pouring rain scenes, the final scene, all were great. If you want a good scare, this movie will give it to you. Believe me, the movies after number 2 were not nearly as good (except number 6, for some reason.)"
3,Best of the Worst,"Of all the horror movie series, ""Friday the 13th"" is notorious for being the worst. But, if like many of us out there, you are a die-hard slasher-flic fan, and you have to see one of these, see this one. It has the most solid plot line, with a wonderful ending that defeats the ""Jason Vorhees"" stereotype. Kevin Bacon's role in this movie is classic (but no good if you want to play the 6-Degrees Game). When watching this one, enjoy it for all it is, because after this one, it is all down hill. (And yet they keep making more. Look for ""Jason X"" in 2001)"
3,"More, More, More","A great DVD to buy but lets see the whole series released in some kind of Box Set like the Nightmare on Elm St collection which is a must for any DVD fan. I'd like to see more extras though and not just a trailer, but if it's just a Digital Jason your craving for then this is for you."
3,"The best of the series,I suppose",I saw this movie when iwas about seven or eight cos my brother rented it out.I didnt realise it would be so pornograpic!Mr.s Voorees was a brilliant killer-they completly copied her in scream2.from a horror fan in ireland
3,Really not that bad.,"This movie was trashed by the critics and I don't really blame them that much. But this is a pretty good movie to watch if you're just looking for fun, I guess. I don't mean Independence Day, Starship Troopers, or Men in Black fun! This is just a fun movie to watch cause it's just entertaining in a sick way. A price of $8.99 ain't that bad for this movie. If you have the money, buy it. If not, don't worry, it's not that special of a movie. Just watch it to discover a fun time of murder and mayhem and not the masterpiece of the 1980's!"
3,you just have to....,"Ok, you just have to see this...because it's a classic...Like Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween, Friday the 13th was one of the ones to start the whole eighties slasher flick thing. True, I think after nine sequels, it's pretty much been beat to death, but this WAS the original...and there's something to be said for that...and the ending was creative. the reason behind the three star rating...personally there are very few movies I've seen taht are worth a five star rating, and it could have had a LITTLE more gore in it (think the Evil Dead...with help of plenty of Oatmeal and corn syrup.) It was actaully one of the better of the series, although I still think Final Chapter was the best."
3,"Not a great plot, but chilling nonetheless.","This was one of those fairly classic horror movies with the cheap budget and the silly music. Unfortunately, murder seemed to be the only real event in the film. Personally I like movies with a deeper plot. Still, some of the scenes are wildly gory, like the one where the character Jack (played by Bacon) gets impaled from behind in the neck. (BTW, as usual Kevin Bacon gets to be the male sex symbol, although this was not yet a pattern at the time this was filmed. Here he (Jack) even gets to have sex on camera! Yum...)Don't expect your brain to be on full force here. Besides, everything here is so old that the modern mind may not register it as horror. It was a decent effort though."
5,"""Look what you did to him, look what you did""!!!","His name was Jason. Jason should have been wathched. He, he wasn't a very good swimmer. We can go now. THat's what you think, I tried to forget about this but could not. It may be a little dated but still worth a watch."
3,Here'sss MOMMY!,. ...This film was pretty scarey the first time around. Simple story maniacal killer going around killing off teenage camp counselors.Ok movie but all the stupid sequels are ridiculous
3,"Slash e'm, dice e'm, cut up movie","Friday the 13th is one of the oldest slasher classics ever (up with Halloween).The film over the years has been more enjoyable than the first time I've seen it. With the excellent make-up effects by Tom Savini and direction by the great Sean S. Cunningham. The movie is pritty much a no-brainer ,but it doesn't fail to lose its suspense. It's a lot of fun. For die hard fans....look for the Uncut version including unseen footage and extended death scenes. Worth looking for than the regular Paramount edition."
3,The breakthrough in 80's horror,"This movie is a breakthrough in modern horror movies (minus Jason's debut in #2) that started the entire seemingly endless sequels to ""Friday the 13th"" generation. This movie has gore and spawned more sequels due to the bloodthirst of that generation today who still find this movie an ""oldie but a goldie"".I have seen this movie twice and in the process of buying all nine flicks for my own personal viewing. I find that movies like this make a man like me go insane and watch all the sequels like it or not. I call this an obsessed horror buffs mania if you ask me. LOL!!!If you like a simple plot with murders and a whodunit in the middle of the flick, please watch this, this is for you!!!"
3,A forgettable movie,"The success of the classic Halloween was not to be ignored. It set the way for other slasher movies, Friday the 13th being one of them. What disgusted me the most was the fact that this film was an exact copy of Halloween. The plot is different but the basic principle is that a lot of people are killed off by a mysterious homicidal maniac. The plot isn't all that bad, shame about the eight sequels which followed. Despite warnings of the history of Camp Crystal, a history soaked in blood a group of sexcrazed teenagers embark on a trip only to find out the camp isn't so idyllic as it looks. A dark deadly secret lies among the haunted lake stalking the camp counsellors one by one. Overall this film didn't do much for me. It is watchable but certainly forgettable."
2,Hmmm....it's better than a kick in the face,"Despite spawning too many sequels I care to count, this first of the series was the best, which doesn't say much.. The only thing saving this movie is Palmer's performance as Jason's mother, a lot more effective than the rest of the cast. Too bad we only see her for about 15 minutes. I recommend just fast forwarding to the last 15 minutes and you will see the whole so-called plot spouted by Palmer. Because up to that point, it is just a dragged on boring film (more boring than the Republican National Convention)."
3,why three stars?,because it is good and all but a mad momma doesnt do it for me 3*s watch the movie first rent it then buy it if you want to why? because youre friends might like it KoA_darksaber {12}
3,Better Than Most Awful 80's Slasher Films,"Friday the 13th alone is a bad film, but when compared to its sequels it is seen in higher light. I like the dark atmmosphere that it has, but it really isn't all that scary and its characters are pretty cliched. Betsy Palmer plays the role of the villain very well, which is the best part of the movie. Personally, I think she's much scarier or more fightening than Jason."
3,slightly different edit,"I just thought I'd point out the dvd of this film is a slightly different edit from the VHS. At the end, Jason's mother is decapitated by the young female protagonist. In the VHS version, after Mrs. Voorhees is decapitated the camera lingers on her headless body a little bit longer, enough for us to see her body raise up both her arms and hands before falling down. That last part on the dvd is taken out. You do see her beheaded, but they cut to the girl's reaction. You don't see the body briefly raise both fists. The DVD cuts to the body falling down. On the other hand, fans of Kevin Bacon will be pleased to note that on the DVD version the camera lingers on his bare backside a minute longer than on the VHS. These may seem like minor details, but personally I don't like it when either VHS tapes or DVD's edit out material that was in the theatrical version. Let's face it, if we want to see an edited version of a movie, we can always watch network T.V."
3,An alright movie,Friday the 13th is one of the first movies to start the slasher flicks trend in the 80's. The acting is okay but really no one would talk like that. The gore is pretty high but I think it would be scarier if more of the kills were off screen. I have to say the music is very similar to the Psycho theme. The old atmosphere gives the film a creepier feel. The only part that bothered me was the end fight because it was really cheesy. I wont say because I don't want to spoil it for people who want to see it. The movie is a mystery movie where a group of people stay together and one of them is the killer. Its like 10 little Indians and House on the Haunted Hill. This is definitely a movie for gore hounds.
3,Kill her mommy!,"I thought this movie was boring, I liked some of the other ones better, just because they were exciting, not because of the story.The first one actually does have a good story. A kid drowns and his mom gets pissed off. Makes sense. ...I like the killings, some of them were surprising. This movie didn't really scare me at all until the end. I'm not going 2 spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but it made me jump really high.Well, it's not really entertaining but if you're bored and have nothing else to do, might as well. Haha."
4,GOOD CD,"Don't let the four stars fool you, this is still a great cd, but I prefer to listen to WILD IN THE STREETS, BACK FOR ANOTHER TASTE, LONG WAY TO HEAVEN, and NO REST FOR THE WICKED. This does have a lot of wonderful tracks on it though such as ROCK YOU, the remake of GIMME GIMME GOOD LOVIN', ANIMAL HOUSE, and WHEN THE HAMMER FALLS. Give it a try, I know you won't be disappointed."
5,thanks fothe cd helix,i listen to it everyday i can i have listen to then for a long time they your the best i listen to at work in my car in my house
4,25 years later and it still rocks!,"This is one of the greatest ROCK albums of the 80's. Some people claim bands i never heard of from the Hair band decade made great albums like, Waysted, Danger Danger, etc. THEY SUCK! Those bands have keyboards and lame singers no guitar solos, you know what I'm talking about. HELIX ROCKS YOU! The songs have powerful guitars, searing solos, and great melodies. Rock You, Make me do, Feel the Fire, Animal House, Six strings, Nine Lives are the cream of the crop. Buy this and you will fall in love with this band."
5,A great book for Buddhist followers.,"This book has a Buddhist entry for each day of the year. The entries deal with various paths in life, and many are very helpful. I recommend this book for all, and especially for those starting out with Buddhism."
3,Some Worthwhile Quotes,"This book is a collection of excerpts from previously published essays, books and magazine articles on various forms of Buddhism. There are some worthwhile quotes here, but most of it feels like filler, stretching to fill one page for every day of the year with some sort of Buddhist-oriented material. If you're looking for a collection of Buddhist publication excerpts, this is a good source. If you're looking for a ""to the point"" collection of Buddhist thought, with more inspiring one-liners than long paragraphs, I recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold."
1,Be Careful!,"Crabb appeals to our sense of self with statements like this one: ""In Christ, I am significant and secure; therefore I can live responsibly before God no matter what happens."" It could be argued that, according to Biblical principles, we are to live responsibly before God regardless of our feelings.There are some neat analogies in this book, but I would caution readers to be aware of Crabb's humanistic view of people and marriage. There is no Biblical basis for the claims that we all have needs for security and significance, or that these needs must be met before we can live obediently before God.I HIGHLY recommend any of Jay Adams's books for a strong, Biblical perspective on the human condition. The link here is my personal favorite.The Biblical View of Self-Esteem, Self-Love, and Self-Image"
1,Most dissatisfied,"Book was very disappointing. Very little to assist the relationship between the couple. Everything went back to the personal relationship with God. Which in and of itself is not a bad thing - but - the message I kept receiving over and over was ""a good personal relationship with God will solve all your (marital) problems regardless of what they are or how incompatable your relationship is.""If both you and your partner are heavy into conservative, Christian religion where ""women will give themselves to their husbands as the Bible commands"" then by all means buy the book; otherwise, I suggest you look at other authors."
2,Not the Biblical View of man,"""I was disappointed with this book. Dr. Crabb states that a man's greatest need is significance and a woman's greatest need is security. My understanding of the Bible is that the single greatest need for both men and women is salvation and sanctification. Not only is the assessment of man's need wrong, he says that this must be dealt with BEFORE Biblical principles can be applied. A better approach would be to apply biblical principles to the lives of men and women and allow the Holy Spirit to work in them so that they will find their security and significance in Christ alone."""
4,Marriage Book,"It was a little slow in getting here, but it is very well written. The style of the print is very easy to read and understand."
3,"I thought this product worked well, but I ...","I thought this product worked well, but I wouldn't call it the best deodorant I've ever used. Even though it says it goes on clear I noticed when I took off my shirt the white residuals of deodorant were left behind. As an antiperspirant and deodorant it does the job adequately and the price is very reasonable comparable to other brands."
4,"Laid-back, Soulful Christmas","Every cut on this CD is imbued with deep, soulful energy. ""When There's Love"" and ""25th of Last December"" have a lovely syncopated beat. ""Because This Child Was Born"" is given the full choir-and-orchestra treatment. A duet with Peobo Bryson, ""As Long as There's Christmas,"" is lush and spirited. Ms. Flack's take on that perennial chestnut ""The Christmas Song"" is particularly personal. Yes, the tempos on this album are on the slow side, as other listeners have noted. But there are times in the busy holiday season when we need to sloooowww down. This CD is a perfect antidote for holiday stress."
1,Irritating fabric!,"While the gloves do offer the perfect amount of pressure, which in turn offers a comforting feel for my sore hands and fingers, the outside fabric is so rough and irritating that it negates any value the gloves could have. And even though they are somewhat helpful in propelling my wheelchair due to their tackiness, I cannot understand why they need to have the tacky (and therefore scratchy and rough) material on the entire back of the hands!I had very high hopes for the gloves based on the great reviews that they have but in this instance I am extremely disappointed. If the idea of scratchy, irritating fabric does not matter to you I think you will appreciate the gentle 'squeezing'. But if the idea of it even slightly concerns you, pass on this pair and keep searching."
4,Arthritis gloves,"My Rheumatologist suggested that I get some Arthritis gloves to sleep in, and gave me some local medical supply stores to shop. I decided to try the Thermoskin gloves instead of going to the suggested stores- where I was sure the product would not be in stock, have to be special ordered, and be off the charts expensive. I like my Thermoskin gloves, and my hands don't hurt like they did before the gloves. The one thing I just started to do is put powder on my hands before bedtime, as the gloves make your hands sweat, and I was getting fungal type irritation between my middle and ring fingers at the junction of my palm. This area would be super sore in the morning, but go away as soon as I took the gloves off. The powder hasn't helped as of yet."
1,Item too stiff,The item is too stiff and doesn't move for daily activity. It also has a funny feel to the material. And it has a funny odor.
3,Not bad,"I do enjoy the relief these provide my hands. Used to be a problem shifting my car's stick and these help. My biggest complaint is that there is NO information. How tight is too tight? How long should these be worn? I wore them to bed one night only to awaken several hours later with the feeling my arms would fall off. I appreciate the relief but worry about potentially damaging my circulatory system over utilizing these and there is absolutely no direction or information provided to avoid problems - if there any. No info, no idea if these are completely safe or if there are concerns with tightness and length of time wearing."
4,Helps to minimize morning pain,Started wearing a glove on my right hand at night due to thumb stiffness and pain in the morning. They helped to keep my hand warm and less stiff.I have very small hands and the extra small size fits well around the palm but not as snug around the fingers. Which leads to one small con: some mornings the webbing between my ring and middle finger is slightly irritated.Very good construction - neat seams and quality material. I've washed them once with no problems. Wish I could purchase a single glove since I have no use for the left glove at the moment.
5,Great help,"I have rheumatoid arthritis in my right hand. This glove has helped me to type this review. It is wonderful! I sleep in it, and wear it sometimes during the day. Reduces swelling and pain."
2,gift for a drummer,"I bought these for my husband, who's experiencing arthritis in his hands. He plays the drums and sometimes he's in so much pain and can't hold the drum sticks. I thought that these gloves would help, but they were very stiff and uncomfortable to wear."
5,Help for Aching Hands!,"I bought these gloves in XXL for my dad (who has very large hands) because his hands were always aching from the arthritis that has developed from driving a transfer truck for many years. The gloves fit him great (and his hands are big and hard to fit). He loves these gloves, and said they started helping immediately! He always wears them when he drives now. Highly recommend these for people who have those aching hands at the end of the day from working with your hands!"
4,Pretty Good,This product works pretty good. It is tight which supports the joints and it keeps my hands warm. The only problem I have is that it makes my hands sweat and after I take it off my hads smell like a dirty old shoe.
2,Sent them back,"I don't like the texture- very rough and annoying. Also, the fingers were too loose- no support for the knuckle joints. I returned them."
3,Thermoskin smelly skin,my daughter has Arthritis very bad in her hands and thought this would be a great gift It makes her hands sweat and the gloves smell. Not worth the money.
5,It really works,"The warmth keeps the joints comfortable, the special fabrics keep the skin cool even though the hand is warm, and the compression helps circulation and pain control. I was skeptical when I bought it but since it was so well thought of orthopedically, I tried it. I am very glad I did."
4,good gloves,bought these for my husband. He has minor arthritis in his hands and works with them all day long. at night he can slip the gloves on any watch tv and he says the compression gives him some relief from the pain. I bought a different type for my father in law He is not as happy with his.
2,Remove the Velcro closure,"The velcro closure frayed the sleeves of my PJ's and the cuffs on a couple of shirts. I removed the velcro closure with box cutters (not easy to do with arthritic hands!)and now the gloves work reasonably well. Other than that I have ruined a couple of garments, I'm satisfied."
3,arthritis and the thermoskin gloves,"While I do think over time this will help the pain and swelling in my hands especially at night, I have not seen any marked improvement in the way my hands feel when I get up in the morning. They are still stiff, have fuid retension and hurt from a night of inactivity. I will be able to rate them better after the summer humidity hits."
2,Did nothing,"I am not sure what the product was supposed to do, but it did nothing to relieve arthritis or neuropathy."
2,Okay?,"The only reason I bought this product is because of finger joint pain, yet there's hardly any finger support. The fingers are too loose, yet I can't get a smaller glove because it wouldn't fit over my hand. It helps somewhat, I suppose..."
4,Relief my Thermoskin Arthritic Gloves Provide,"Having just received my gloves 2 days ago (due to being delivered to wrong address by UPS) I am very pleased with them. The warmth they create does help with the pain. Also my joints have started to draw and I am hoping this will help with the drawing, or lack of, by keeping them straight. Thanks."
2,arthritic gloves,"My husband loves the gloves, but the finger openings are starting to fray, and he is unhappy that the price paid and the fabric threads are getting fuzzy after 6 days. He does not wear them to jobs around the house, as he is afraid they will get worse. Do not know if they can be returned or not after being worn for a certain time period. The support he gets is good if the finger seams come apart , I will have to find another vendor. Star review should have been a five for the price. He has large wrists and they have a hard time fastening properly."
4,Great for Arthritic fingers,"These glove are nice to wear in the yard, under the gardening gloves, to relieve the Arthritis pain in my knuckles fingers. They keep the joints warm and even massage them a bit. I received the gloves within 4 days and started using them immediately. Thank you"
2,Not for me,"These gloves are much thicker than expected. In spite of abiding by the measuring guidelines, they did not fit me well (although I have large hands, the guide said I did not need an extra large). I considered going to a larger size but felt they would simply no do what I needed them to.Two very irritating features:1. The gloves simply don't breathe - consequently I had to peel them off about once an hour. Because they don't breathe they also don't dry very quickly2. The fingers extend literally to the base of your fingertips - essentially leaving just the ball of your fingers exposed.From other reviews, these gloves have helped some; however, they are just not for me."
1,fabric too stiff and itchy,I returned this item because the fabric was too stiff and caught on my clothing and was scratchy against my skin
3,Helpful but....,I wear these gloves when I sleep and I think they are helpful for both my arthritis & raynaud's disease but I had an allergic reaction after the first couples nights. I must wear a non-latex glove under them. There must be made with rubber or latex - I'm allergic to both.
3,gloves,these gloves work well for my painful joints. Only problem is that I have to handwash them often. Stitching comes undone easily.
4,The Classics Nichelle Style!,"The great and highly underrated Nichelle Nichols performs classic tunes with her one-of-a-kind voice. This album will thrill those into the ""standards"". Nichelle has command of each song and manages to infuse her unique style into each of these chestnuts. To hear Nichelle in a totally different context, try out her great ""Out of This World"" CD. On that record, she rocks. Here, she croons."
2,I like the Beatles.,"This was Nichelle Nichols first album, and the only album she released during the original run of Star Trek. The album consists of the kind of traditional popular songs that a Frank Sinatra or a Peggy Lee would sing. Good songs, but the arrangements aren't that interesting. But the real problem with the album is Nichelle herself. Sure, she has a very impressive vocal range, but so what? On most of these songs, she will throw in high notes just to show that she can hit them, much to the detriment of the songs. I guess you could say she was ahead of her time in that respect, what with all the ""show offy"" singers today. This is not a good album at all, sad to say."
3,'WaNNa Be a BaLLeR',THiS aLBuM iZ PReTTy GooD...BuT THa BeST SoNG iZ WaNNa Be a BaLLeR...THa oTHa SoNGZ aReN'T THaT BaDD
1,Well read below it's my resoning why i gave this a one,"Some people just like West Coast Funk, East Coast Rythm, Down South Blazen Beats, this was none of the above, this CD is not orginized at all, and Lil' Troy is in like 3 of the songs, if you like rappers like Noreaga, DMX, Kurupt, Dre, and Tash just don't go near this CD it's not meant for you, i learned that when i purchased it the backround music, the rapping it's just not for the true rap fan...."
5,THis CD just kicked butt.,The song wanna be a balla is the main song and a really good one at that. That is my favorite song now and I'm looking on how to download it on to my webtv so I can listen to it whenever I'm on. So I recommend you get this one.
5,GREAT HOUSTON RAP MUSIC WITH SOME NICE NON RAP IN IT ALSO!,This cd is Lil' Troys only CD and it is a great one! He really did a great job on the mixing and with his lyrics. Wanna Be a Baller is obviously the best song on the CD (it's acutally on it twice one is edit). I recomend to anyone who just wants some original not too dirty rap music. Love it!
5,BUY THIS ONE!!!,"This is definitely one of the best cd's to have in your car n ryde to. When I got this cd I got it for ""Wanna Be A Balla"" and definitely liked alot of other songs on it, then I finally listened to the songs that I didnt earlier and found out that I love every song on the cd, except for Still A Bitch- that songs just sucks."
2,It's aiight...,"""Wanna be a Balla"" is definately a good cut but there is only maybe one or two other good songs on the CD, if there is a single released just grab that and save your money."
5,Another playa puttin' it down for the SOUTH. Keep bangin'.,Ya'll gonna realize 'THE SOUTH IS ON THE RISE.' Just a bunch of bangin' tracks from real life southern playas. Bang this when ya'll hit the highway.
3,Wanna Be a Baller is a great summer-cruisin' song,"As a dj at Seattle's Kube93, thousands of people have been requesting ""Wanna Be A Baller"" for its infectious groove and laid back vibe. This bad boy sounds incredible in your ride!!!!"
2,it all sounds alike,"The single ""Wanna Be a Baller"" was okay but i have to admit its no different than the other raps out there. Its all about money cars, getting high, and being a balla. Although that's a part of everyday life, if you know other people live it all the time, why not rap about something new?"
4,Good CD,"I frown on the [comment] about how this cd [stinks]. If you buy CD's because of one song, that's sad to begin with. Also since when did ANY RAP ever take talent? Rap doesn't take talent, and it's not about talent in the rap game. This CD has some other great songs besides wanna be a balla. If I were to recommend a rap CD to someone this wouldn't be it, but if you're looking for something fresh this is a good cd to get."
3,It has one or two good songs I really liked wanna be a balle,The track wanna be a baller was phat because the beat was kicking but I didnt really hear much else that I liked with the beats on alot of the other tracks
5,Nuff respect for this book. Great stuff!!!,"I bought this book probably about five years ago and have not regretted it since. In this novel, as in most of his novels, Tyree does not fail to make it riveting and entertaining. This is a book that you just cannot put down until you have reached the end and i literally ""gobbled"" it up when I started reading it. Since then I've read it three times...its so good. Tyree's characters are always real and you learn something from them. A lot of women would be interested in how men think and why they do the things they do and Tyree's main character, Bobby Dallas offers some great enlightenment...he helps resolve some of the mystery and shows us that we need to really take some time to understand the ""brothers"". So ladies, read this book and learn something about men. We could all do with the help."
4,Great Book,"not many books get my stamp of aproval but this book really deserved it. this was one of the first african american books that i read. it was real written, not too man hard to understand words and it made sense. i can relate to it. the fact that Bobby Dallas passed up a perfectly good woman for a more flamboyant one is something we see everyday. for all you love fanatics out there, he ends up with the right woman. omar tyree you are indeed a genius and are one of the best in the game. along with you joins micheal baiden and eric jerome dickey. i would recommend this book for anyone who is skeptical about black books. this is sure to turn you on to them pretty quickly."
2,So Dissapointed,I generally enjoy reading Omar Tyree's books but this one bored the hell out of me. I took to long getting to the point and it lost my attention about half way in. I really do hope that the next book I buy from him will have a little bit more of a faster pace than this one did.
4,A Must Read...,"Great book, definitly a must read... but more importantly if you love african american fiction like I do read his book Flyy Girl... I couldn't put either one of these books down!"
3,It was alright,"This was my first time reading on of Omar's books. It was alright but I was expecting more out of it. I agree with some of the other reviewers. It did carry on a bit much. But I enjoyed it. I really let you know what men are thinking. He caught Faye just in time, when she was single. Because we all know you be stuck in relationships we don't really want to be in. Most people don't sit around and wait!!!"
3,"Slow Start, Slow Ending","After reading Sweet St. Louis and Flyy Girl, I couldn't wait to read a Do Right Man. I was real disappointed after reading a Do Right Man, it was a very slow book. I started it then I put it down for three months and picked it back up to finish. The only reason I finished it was because I don't like to start a book without finishing it. This is not one of Omar Tyree's best books."
3,A second chance with your soul mate,"How many times do we get a second chance with our Soulmate ! Bobby found out later that he had what he needed all the time !As the saying goes he was looking for love and it was right before him but to blind to see it !Way to go Bobby ,hold on its's coming! While I gave this story 3*'s it was actually 3.5 or 3.8 * !! This was one of the better stories I enjoyed by Omar"
1,It's okay.,"I loved Flyy Girl, so I was expecting more from Tyree's second novel. Instead I found a generic, the-one-who-got-away type read. I didn't particularly like or care about the main character, so it was difficult to get into the book. It actually put me off of Tyree's work, and I haven't read any of his since. So don't read this, if it's your first Omar Tyree. Read Flyy Girl."
1,boy iz you crazy!,I loved fly girl and could not wait for A DO RIGHT MAN to come out. and when it did the store is where it should of stayed.
1,Dissappointing,"What was he thinking about when he wrote this one. Bobby was such a ridiculous whimp it was pathetic. He acted like he was scared of his new girlfriend ""PEARL"". Then he was scared of Faye finding out about Pearl.Don't writ e anymore books like this one ever. I love some of his new books. I have all of his books this one did nothing for me.I LOVED FLYY GIRL."
2,Slow to get into.,"This was the first book that I read by Omar Tyree. The story seemed to drag on and was difficulty to get into and stay focus. It took me about three months to finish it, but I was determined to do it. The story line was too slow, and some it seemed far fetched. Especially, when Bobby's income hit the hundred thousand dollar range as a talk show host. I was glad that he got back together with Faye, but her being pregnant was unnecessary. They should have just gotten married."
2,Will this book ever end.,"I'm usually not a critic to many authors, but this is the first book I read and it took about a month to read and that's only because I'm in a book club. It was nice to hear a man's point of view and see that he came to some positive conclusions on how he should take chances with women, but all that it took to get him there. I'm glad he doesn't speak for all men because I would never find a mate. It just makes me wonder if Mr. Tyree is speaking from experience."
3,It was okay,"A Do Right Man was an okay book. It was kinda boring, especially all those radio interviews. I also thought that Bobby was a huge punk. Mostly throughout the book I was just thinking ""I wish it would hurry up and end"" 'cause it didn't seem to be going anywhere. Flyy Girl was definitely much better. Anyway, check this book out from the library, but don't waste your money on it. It's not worth it. Believe me, after reading it, you'll thank me. To Mr. Tyree: Flyy Girl was great, but you got a little lost in A Do Right Man. Better luck next time."
3,OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKAAAAAAAYYYYYY,"I think the book was alright, in the beginning it looked like it was going places, it just got so lax, to where I felt pressure to finish reading the book. I can't just pick up another book and start reading it, so it took all my might to finish reading this book. OOOH, Bobby Dallas was a ""Do Right Man""."
2,Two thumbs down!!,"I did not like this book at all!!! I only finished it b/c I paid money for it and didn't want to waste my money. Bobby was the biggest cry baby that I have ever seen (or not seen since I read about him). All he did was make excuses and blame everyone else for his lack of a spine. It is possible to be a MAN w/o being the whimp that Bobby was and w/o being a dog. I was very disappointed in this book, especially b/c I loved Mr. Tyree's debut novel _Flyy Girl_. I gave the book 2 stars b/c it was well written, but I hated the story and the main character."
2,a major disappointment,"All the right elements were there: the NY, Washington DC/ Howard Univ. settings, an interesting career, NBA players, and more. Unfortunately, Tyree didnt seem to know what to do with them. The result was a flat, boring and one dimensional story with a weak, naive and frankly, stupid main character. I hated Flyy Girl and thought that this book might change my perceptions of the author and his work. Unfortunately, it only served to confirm what I already thought. I don't think I'll be reading any more of his books."
3,Nothing spectacular,"This was my first time reading a book by Omar Tyree and I'm not sure I want to read something else by him!! It left a lot to be desired. The main character, Bobby Dallas was not fresh or exciting. I have met a few people like Bobby, but NO ONE I would ever want to read about. The title does not fit the book. From the title alone I expected a lot more. If you're looking for good books from good african-american male writers, try Eric Jerome Dickey and E. Lynn Harris."
2,Disappointing Read,I was extremly disappointed in this book. I really enjoyed Flyy Girl and waited anxiously for this book. I thought this book was slow and the main character was boring. I could barely finish it. I didn't care about the characters and cared even less about what happened to them.
1,Maybe i was a little to young,"The last Omar Tyree book i read was ""Flyy Girl"" and i loved it, so i thought it would be a good thing to keep reading all of his books. And what do you know i stumbled on ""A do right Man"" on sale for ....at a local book store. To start with i was already looking for the book and second of all i was thrilled with the price. But when i started reading it i was quickly turned off. It was so boring from the beginning and i didn't even finish it because i just couldn't keep reading it. And maybe it was above my level i'm 16 and i've read ""Chocolate Star"", ""The Coldest Winter Ever"" and so i'm not sure if age is an issue here i just think it was a boring book. I know not one of his best works."
3,It was alright,"In what seemed like a lifetime, I finally finished, ""A Do Right Man."" I will admit, I grew quite attached to the main character, Bobby Dallas, but it became increasingly difficult to finish the book. Overall, I found it quite interesting to learn about love and life from a man's perspective. We do need to have more books like these from author Omar Tyree and E. Lynn Harris."
3,"It was Aiight, nothing to brag about.",This was the first book I read by this author. It had so much promise in the beginning.Maybe it's me but it appears to me that at the end of the book Mr.Tyree noticed he was down to his last 7 sheets of paper and had to wrap it up ASAP. Get my drift?In addition to that the main character was a wuss. He was way to soft. Now HE was someone who needed to see the Wizard of Oz to get an immunization against being a wuss.
2,What was all the hype about?,"The introduction was okay, but totally misleading raising my expectation of the story a little too high. By the second chapter I was sorely tempted to put the book to one side. It wasn't that it didn't have a good storyline, it did, it was just how it was written, too much detail on areas of no relevance i.e. type of drink, and after a while it seemed like the author had digressed and kept struggling to get back to the plot. It started getting better towards the end of the story, but for me that was too little too late. Omar Tyrees' other novel 'Flyy Girl' was recommended to me, as I couldn't get hold of it in time I picked this one, I'm still going to give it a second try and get my original choice and see how that goes."
3,No way near better than the first book,"I read Omar Tyree first book flyy girl and it was truly flyy. This book a do right man is not what was no way near the excitement and fun that was contained in flyy girl. However, it did have it's moments and finally an author is reflected how some men truly are and not the playboy that they are portrayed in other books."
2,The character development was not what it could have been.,"This is the second item of Tyree's that I have read. Though the story and character development was not to my liking, the story was much better than Fly Girl. The author has come a long way, but needs to work a little harder."
2,"More Like ""A Typical Man""","Why is the title ""A Do Right Man""? I didn't get it. What was so do right about Bobby Dallas? He was the typical black man IMO. He ended up with a great job and salary and only THEN did he decide that HE was ready to settle down and Faye was supposed to be with it. NOT!He played a couple of different women, was dishonest, and less than ""right"".I only finished the book because I spent my hard owned money on it. This book was ENTIRELY too slow. It's like, please get to the point Omar Tyree. After this, I believe I am finished supporting him and his less than stellar novels. I only wish that I hadn't spent money on a black man writing about how hard it is for another black man out there in the dating and professional world when I can get that same sob story at any local hangout. SAVE IT and SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,A Confused Disc Jockey,"Oh my what a mess! Here we meet Bobby Dallas, an unassertive student at Howard University who starts ""sleeping"" with a girl who he's obviously afraid of! He moves to New York with Pearl gets a job blah...blah...blah... she leaves he leaves and he goes on and on like this the entire book. In college Bobby and his best friend Faye had a liking for one another okay why they didn't get it on? At the end of the book they finally get together! The details about working in the radio industry was really interesting and I guess Omar was trying to get across how hard it is to be a ""black male"" but it failed in my opinion! The character just came across as simple not as struggling to learn he didn't have the backbone he was a gentleman but at what cost? I loved Single mom but I haven't picked up anything else by Omar."
4,good read,I like to get into the lives of characters and Mr. Tyree gave me a chance to do this. I felt like I grew right along with Bobby Dallas. I love the fact that I was able to be there when he hooked up with the true love of his life. Could there possibly be a sequel??????
2,Too slow!,"I was very disappointed in A Do Right Man! I found the story extremely slow, and the main character, Bobby Dallas, rather boring. The book needed an editor to ""punch up"" the story line, ie add some conflict, tension, scandal, etc. to engross the reader. As is, it was a challange to finish the novel, simply because I didn't care what happened next.I also found it hard to believe that this was the authors' fourth novel. Try to add some life to your next work Omar!!"
3,Was This a Satire?,"Most of the members of ITCOMS could not decide if this novel was trying to say that men have it as hard as women or was the author playing the ""switcheroo"" with the ""all men are dogs"" type books? We all read the book and enjoyed the book. We had a lively discussion and decided that the book was well written. It is worth reading."
4,"This was a great book for character content, I cared.",The development of each character in this story was presented smoothly and right on time. There was not one question as to who was being discussed or the need to place them in the story when they appeared.I'm waiting for the next book by Mr. Tyree with great anticipation.
4,Entertaing read! Bobby Dallas is truly A Do Right Man!!,"The amazing thing about this book is that I felt thay I truly understood Bobby Dallas. His trials and tribulations (although certainly not his naivete) are a good view of the other side of relationships. I laughed, cried, and even fumed when he didn't seem to be able to see Pearl and Faye for the women they were.I agree with the reviewer who was thrown off balance by Faye's pregnancy--it sort of gave a rushed, and-they-lived-happily-ever-after ending to what was otherwise an engaging, funny, and timely story. I especially loved the fact that despite what he went through professionally and personally, Bobby never lost that modest quality that grabbed me from the first page and kept me enthralled to the last word. Good job, Omar Tyree!"
1,Disappointed,"After hearing so much about Mr. Tyree, I was anxious to start on the novel as soon as I got home from the bookstore. Unfortunately, about 3 chapters into the book, I was already disappointed in what I was reading. The author has no real lyrical style and his dialouge was mundane. Since the majority of the book was dialouge, it was extremely slow reading for me. All in all, a disappointment."
2,A DO RIGHT DON'T!,"This was a hot mess, it was so boring I couldn't even finish the book, I passed it on to my cusion, and she said the same thing, I just gave the book away. My hopes were all high from Flyy Gryl, but thats the only good book that Omar written. I was so upset by this that I actually wanted to write Omar Tyree myself and ask him what the hell was going on. I mean when you write a bad book chances are that no one is going to want to read the next book. I hate reading a bad book because I feel it is just a waist of my time, and I could've done somthing better. Omar, you owe my 4 hours of a good book."
2,This One Let Me Down,"This story was about a young brother trying to make it in life.I have to admit that I was excited to read this book, and it let me down. I didn't like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him. I don't think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a ""Do Right Man"" at all, but rather a wimp. During the first half of the book, I waited for him to get a back bone, which he never did. From there on the whole story was slow. I was bored about continually reading about him and his radio job. This was a slow read for me, I skipped a few chapters just so I could find out what finally happened in the end."
4,Good Reading,YOu know a book is good when you can put it down. Its nice to know that E.J.Dickey is not the only brother who can write!
3,Did it work for u cuz at times it didn't for me,"This book started off slow. But it had its good parts. Bobby an inspiring radio host is so confused. He has a girlfriend that he is scared of and she just does him wrong. I don't think the males would agree with the way he handled it, until the end. But the book was ok to read. I don't want to say it was bad but it was cool."
4,I can relate...,"As a black professional male, I can truly relate to the career and relationship struggles of the main character (Bobby Dallas) of this book. I commend Omar Tyree for portraying a brother who does have aspirations of wife, family, and the house on the hill. Certain portions of the novel are slow and should have detailed the family and female relationships of Bobby Dallas' life versus the caveats of the radio industry. However, this was a pretty good book and I would recommend it to others."
2,"Omar Tyree, you know you can do better!!!",I read this book a while ago and felt that it could not compare to his first book. I loved Flyy Girl!!!! This book moved entirely too slow and by the end I had to force myself to finish it. I did not like the character Bobby Dallas. I wish you better success with your next book.
2,I don't know any men like Bobby Dallas!!!,"I don't think Omar Tyree's depiction of Bobby Dallas was very realistic. He seemed to be a real wimp. My bookclub read this book and none of us liked it. Furthermore, Faye was a very strong, independent character. Why did he have her character get pregnant before they were married? Was she trying to trap him or was she just plain stupid when it came to birth control? The ending seemed to be thrown together, not very well thought out. Better luck next time Omar."
2,"Omar Tyree, you know you can do better!!","I read this book a while ago and thought it was nothing compared to his first book, Flyy Girl. A Do Right Man moves entirely too slow. I had to force myself to finish the book. I did not care for Bobby Dallas. I wish you better success with your next novel."
2,I was disappointed in this book!!,"My Book Club just finished discussing this book and overall we were disappointed. This book is really pegged as a book dealing with relationships from a male point of view but it really dealt more with Bobby's Radio career than anything else. We initially liked Faye's character because she was very strong, independent and career oriented but at the end when she was suddenly pregnant, that didn't sit very well with us. She certainly didn't need to trap Bobby at that point and it didn't make sense that she would intentionally get pregnant before they got married. It seemed as if the ending was just thrown together with very little thought. I hope the next book is better."
4,Slow at times...but overall decent.,"After reading Flyy Girl, (which I enjoyed) I was curious what Mr. Tyree would do with a book strictly involving adults. I wasn't too disappointed. I liked how he showed a more vulnerable side of black males, in contrast to the way many of them were portrayed in Flyy Girl. Also I went to an HBCU, so I could totally relate with the whole New York vs Down South vibe between Pearl and Faye. On the flip side, the tedious explanations and conversations surrounding the radio industry really slowed the plot down for me. As a former broadcast major, I agree Mr. Tyree gave an accurate description of the business. However, in-depth analysis of it made for a less enjoyable read. Otherwise, the main character was likable, and I was definitely invested in his journey throughout. Not so sure i'll read it again, but glad I finished it and saw Bobby's progression all the way to the end."
3,iNTERESTING-DIFFERENT,"I read Flyy girl, I was not impressed, mainly because I have a teenage daughter, and some of the things that Ms Tracey was putting her Mother,through it just brought back bad memories of the relationship that I have with my daughter. I just finished reading A do right Man, and it took me about two weeks to finish it. It did not hold my interest, but it was a good book. I would recommed it for reading, I always share my books with avid readers of black fiction."
1,no answer from amazon for my problem,i bought this book and i saw there were missing pages between 30 to 70.i writed about it and there was no answer from answer.Obviously i experienced disappointment.
4,"Mounts, but 90 degrees off","The wrist mount does work with the Garmin Edge 500. However, the top of the Edge is near my wrist, which makes it a little hard to read (you'd expect the left side to be closest to the wrist)."
5,I use this for my Garmin Edge 500 bike computer...,"I bought this so that I could use the watch strap for my Garmin Edge 500 bike computer when I run. I didn't figure I needed to buy yet another computer. The Edge 500 snaps right into place and it works great. (Note if you are thinking about using your Garmin Edge 500 for running, you won't get pace data. You'll only get MPH, but with elementary math I'm sure you can handle it.) Great little kit."
1,Not for 910XT,I searched for Garmin 910XT quick release kit here in Amazon. This came up. I ordered it only to find out later that it won't fit the 910XT because it's for the older and smaller Garmin Forerunner watches. I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.
4,Great accessory for bike-to-run!,"I bought this for my Forerunner 201 so that I could use it for bike, run, and brick workouts for an upcoming triathlon (I am trying to hold off on getting the 910XT). Very easy to assemble and use; you can even attach the extra mount to the velcro strap that comes with the 201 (which I prefer, since the rubber strap slides around on a sweaty wrist!) The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the mounting adapter for the wrist makes the unit a bit heavy for me, but I am a pretty small boned person to begin with (5-1/2 inch wrist) so it may very well be fine for most people. A great purchase!"
3,Great but not very strong,"Very well designed, the kit is set up in a minute and allows you to seamlessly click out from running to biking etc...The only downside I should mention is that that the base bracket (which is mounted on the Garmin) cracked after only a couple of months.I didn't find any spare parts for sale so I'm buying a new kit."
2,Trancelike vs Stultifying,"One person's soothing trance is another's enervating soporific. In spite of a solid set of back-up musicians creating some inventive variations on a theme, I thought the theme itself was monotonous. Maybe it's the influence of featured artist, Boris Grebenshikov, a grim Russian if there ever was one. I believe that the term Bardo refers to a Tibetan Buddhist version of the Christian Limbo or Purgatory. Certainly not the mystical, mythical place I would want to visit. And the music perfectly captures that droning, drowning in goo interdimensional place. I don't generally like everything Gabrielle Roth has produced, but some of her work is among the best out there. I was particularly disappointed in this one."
3,Lost Gabriel Track Worth Price Of Admission.,"Obviously a risky proposition, Steve Hackett's Genesis Revisited project is full of hits and misses alike. However, there are two cuts that make it well worth having - Valley Of The Kings and Deja Vu. Valley Of The Kings is a new Hackett instrumental in his classic style, lush and majestic with those hallmark chill-inducing guitar melody lines. Deja Vu is the real treat here. Originally composed by Peter Gabriel and actually rehearsed by Genesis during the Selling England By The Pound sessions, the song was ultimately shelved until Hackett dusted it off some 26 years later (with Gabriel's permission) to be ""revisited"" on this CD. It's an absolutely beautiful gem. Had it been included on Selling England, it would now be considered a Genesis classic. Plunk down your hard-earned money and get this CD for these two cuts alone. You won't be disappointed."
3,For Genesis Fans Only!,"After listening to the 30 second previews of these songs on Amazon.com for about a month, I finally decided to purchase this CD.Some of the songs sound great reinterpreted (Watcher of the Skies, Firth of Fifth, Los Endos) and some...well not so much. (Your Own Special Way, I Know What I Like).Some are barely recognizable and uninspiring.It's a shame that Hackett didn't use John Wetton more, especially for the songs that he himself sang. Hackett's voice is not great and for me the weakest link on this CD.His guitar playing however is outstanding and I enjoy hearing the old Mellotron sounds on many songs.Also great to hear Bill Bruford, Tony Levin and Pino Palladino.There are some hits...but definitely some misses on this record.I will continue to listen to this CD and hopefully it will grow on me.I would recommend this CD for diehard Genesis/Steve Hackett fans only, but would still give it a strong 3 stars out of 5.E. JanzenAbbotsford B.C.Canada"
3,When inspiring and embarrassing collide,"From homage to ""oh god"", there are fortunately enough fun tweaks to validate the project for even the (relatively lenient) scrutinizing fan."
4,Best Live Genesis Album?,"OK, OK, I know it is not a Genesis album as such, and that it is not live, but that's how it feels. And it IS the best thing to come out of the Genesis stable since The Lamb. This is prog at it hugest. An absolute must for Genesis fans, in many case improving on the original album track."
1,Rubbish,"This is just plain miserable. The production sounds dated in a way that the original's never do. The vocals are awful, the musicianship uninspired. Has Hackett's well of creativity run so dry that he is left with no better ideas than to re-visit his own old catalog of material? Skip this garbage, stick with the originals...Simon"
4,A spectacular performance,"For once Sony did a spectacular job at remastering this historical performance. The opening percussions of Fanfare for the Common Man are just explosive but the whole disc is full of colors and a tribute to Copland's masterpieces.Don't be afraid to listen to this disc at concert levels, that's how it is best enjoyed and the best way to discover one of the most impressive American contemporary composers.I am less enamored with Warfield's performance of the Old American songs but in all fairness they've never been my cup of tea to start with."
5,Superb!,"This album brings together the epitome of whi Copland was. If you have never listened to him before, this is your starter album."
4,Appalachian Spring always makes me smile,Copland has always been my favorite 20th century composer. This recording of Copland conducting the Lomdom Philharmonic is wonderful. I was worried that the age of the recording would result in poor quality but the opposite was true. The sound quality is superb. If you Like Copland get this album.
2,Copland conducts Copland,Item was recommended by a radio announcer. I think is okay. I thought that if Copland conducted his own works would be exciting but it was not. It is very boring.
2,Crumbs,"These crackers taste great and we like that they are organic. However, the texture is too soft to make it through shipping. We buy and enjoy other Late July products at the local branch of a popular grocery store that features lots of imports and organics, such as their cheese flavored and whole grain crackers. Perhaps if that store carried this type they'd be okay to purchase from there, but when we opened the case of these that arrived on our doorstep from Amazon, about half the crackers in each box had been reduced to fine crumbs during shipping."
5,Very good crackers,"Great substitute/healthier choice for RITZ. My only wish would be for bigger boxes. This may sound strange, but, they taste great crushed up over a bowl of ice cream."
5,A perfect substitute,"Being dairy-free and not wanting to eat high fructose corn syrup, I was thrilled to find crackers that could replace other buttery-tasting crackers. My favorite lunch: Wolfgang Puck soup with Late July crackers crumbled into it. Yumm!"
5,Very Impressive,"I purchased this book through Amazon from Midtown Scholar Bookstore in Harrisburg Penn. Their service was outstanding. The book was to replace one that I have more than overused in the past several years; one that was a gift to my husband from a dear uncle. Unfortunately, it is almost beyond repair. When I found this one described as ""unread and unmarked, with some shelf damage to the dust cover"" at $12 plus shipping I grabbed it!! My husband had recently bought himself one through another online vendor - may have been ebay, for $100 plus. My copy is every bit as good as his ""new"" one. It may qualify as a collector copy that some vendors are asking $300+ for. Am I happy? You bet!!"
5,Thank heavens,"This cd is my first pick of must haves. ""Alf"" can pack more of an emotional whallop in one lyric than any of the ""divas"" of today could put in to an entire album. If you enjoy a deep voiced, powerful female vocalist, you are going to LOVE Alison Moyet and this, of all her albums, is the BEST. She belts out this emotional roller coster with such passion she will haunt your cd player for years. Unlike her following solo releases, this one is soulfully earthy and mostly accoustic sounding. Very different from her electronica albums. ( not that they're bad, just different) Try it, you're gonna fall in love."
2,Lawyer who knew nothing about the Holocaust or War World II?,"I was very surprised to learn that Helen Fremont was able to become a lawyer and knew nothing about the Holocaust. What kind of education did she obtain? How was it possible that she wasn't interested in her parent's history? Even if they were Roman Catholics.Book is full of historical errors (Warsaw was captured within hours, it was safer to be a Pole in the streets a Lvov during the German invasion)It bothered me that the street names were Misspelled (Owacowa instead of Owocowa, Mariacki Platz insead of Plac Mariacki)The story itself was very interesting. I wish however it was written by her parents."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"Though this is a best-seller, it wasn't really what I expected and did not live up to my expectations. Although the story itself is somewhat captivating at times, the author asked many questions but left them unanswered. Flashing from the past back to moments in her own life was also confusing at times. It was a good book, but I was hoping for more. It was like the author uncovered all of this information about her family, but never found out everything. These gaps led me to ask more questions and wonder what really happened, and left me yearning for more. The story of her parents' lives during and after the war never actually came to an end because not all of the questions were ever answered."
4,"Not quite what I was expecting, but good.","This book is a story of a daughter and her two parents who were raised in a Roman Catholic family, but she, somehow always felt different. She goes on to find that her parents were Jewish holocaust survivors. Reading about their lives, it put my daily problems into perspective. Her parents were constantly acting and surviving on a daily basis for thier live and and their actions made for a strange childhood for the author, because anything could happen.Her father was a prisoner of war and her mother moved around in other nationalities all because she wanted to survive. After six years, and lots of barriers between them, there parents finally find each other, but they were not the same people that each had fallen in love with because of the war--it had changed them dramatically.The results of their ordeals and the family they raised proved to be some very interesting reading."
1,unfortunately not long enough,"True, for the first 75 pages I could not put it down. Then the memoir ended and the fiction began. I struggled on for another 100 pages at which point I decided that Ms. Fremont was masquerading under false pretenses and gave up. A lively imagination does not a memoir make. It needed to be reclassified as fiction. I have rarely read a book that initially engaged me so thoroughly and then disapointed so totally."
5,Excellent,"This book has inspired me to go looking for my herritage, it is amazing how the Holocoust survivors can stand to hide what they have been through, and hide it from their children? I don't know, but I would be hurt inside, and I would need to tell someone! I hope people like this book as much as I did. It is incredibly good!"
1,(facepalm),"Why is this book labeled a ""memoir"" when it is so clearly and explicitly fiction? Helen Fremont clearly wants a heroic/tragic/pathetic history for her family, all buried in grim silence... so much silence, in fact, that she had to make the entire history up.Good grief. This book is a waste of both Helen Fremont's considerable storytelling talent and my time."
5,The Perfect Gift for Friends,I have given this book as a gift to at least five friends. I couldn't put it down!
1,fiction,"I'm sorry but I couldn't finish it... so I did not get to the part of the author being lesbian (!) It was... funny, predictable, I read books like that before written by Jewish Americans, they all seem to use the same myths over and over and base whole book around them. You read one, you have a feeling like you read them all. Boring..."
3,Interesting but self-serving,"While the style was easy reading, the book is flawed in several ways. In her Author's Note Ms. Fremont tells us that she has ""...imagined details in an effort to convey the emotional truths of my family's experiences."" So, what was real and what wasn't? If some ""facts"" are fictionalized, how can we believe any of it? In addition, Ms. Fremont's sexual orientation had absolutely no place in this book. After a while you got the impression that she wrote her family's story as a way of coming out, of being accepted as a lesbian by way of revealing their ""dark secrets."" She kept asking the family members if it was all right with them if she was gay. Ms. Fremont, either get a new therapist or GET OVER IT!In the end I have enormous respect for Ms. Fremont's family whose secrets I belive she should have kept to herself and hope that she finds some way to deal with her own turmoil."
3,This is a good first novel,"Although this book has some fascinating aspects, I can't help but find the style to be mediocre. It lacks the strong cohesion and polish that writers such as Angelou and Duras display in their memoirs. However, if you are interested in European life during WWII, particularly the Jewish experience, then you will gain insight from this novel."
2,Out of the Closet,"The story was excellent - it was engaging - I couldn't put it down. Why, oh why, Ms. Fremont did you have to use this medium to come out of the closet? I don't care if you're a homosexual - I'm neither pro-gay or anti-gay.It was the wrong place. I wonder if that is why your parents ""did not approve of [your] book . . . 'After what they went through . . . .'"" (Afterword) How sad that you added this to what they have had to endure!"
2,Disappointed,"As a student of Holocaust survivor stories, I am surprised by my disappointment in this book. I had looked forwarded to reading it. By now everyone knows her family's story. At the book's end, has the author just switched one family for another? To me, at mid-story, she'd decided to push on and not just solve the mystery of her family, but to betray her family's confidences and wishes. And to what end? She does this over and over again. She betrays her aunt to her cousin, and her parents in print. How her sexual orientation comes into play makes no sense to me. Her mother and aunt are the true stars of the tale -- while she, the author, comes off as a rather selfish, not-very-kind person. I wonder what damage this book caused to her parents, her Italian aunt and that family. They seem so unimportant to her -- as, on the last pages, the author extols the ""...bagels and table of deserts"" served at her new family's reunion."
2,Disappointing on many levels,"This book deals with a woman searching for her roots and finding surprises. While this is an interesting story, which is much more common than many people realize, I felt disappointed by the book. The writing style was weak and the filling in of details from the past was distracting. Furthermore, I was infuriated at the author's need to ""out"" her family's Judaism to members who would have rather stayed ""in the closet"". I felt particularly incensed by this, given the fact that she apparently respected her lesbian friends need to make their own decisions about whether to share their identity with the world."
4,Reliving the Past,"If you are interested in learning how our forefathers lived without the modern day conveniences that we enjoy today, this book is a must read. You will learn how they survived without much income and you could learn something beneficial that you never knew."
5,I love the whole series!,I am from the Appalachian mountains. I am collecting these books to hand down to my kids. This is definately the perfect way to preserve your roots. I HIGHLY reccomend the whole series. Don't let the old ways die!
1,NO IDEA what they're saying,"I heard about this book and thought, ""OH I'm from the South and this book will be lovely to read to find out about how things used to be."" And I would probably have been right if I could have made out what they were talking about. The slang is much too thick for me. I'm not sure anyone could understand it except people who actually are from this region. Thumbs down for no translation."
1,Terrible piece of writing,This book is so poorly written that PETA is undoubtedly pleased with it - the author's ignorance is showing with every grammatical error and every poorly constructed sentence. This man apparently has no scruples. At least members of PETA practice what they preach and in fact put their very freedom in jeopardy for their beliefs.
1,A grammatical and editorial review.,"I've read a lot of books in my lifetime. The grammatical errors in this book made me want to cringe! The writing style was choppy, disorganized, and read like something a child in 5th grade might have composed. Although the subject was interesting, I was absolutely unable to finish this book due to the poorly written prose and grammar. In fact, I found myself starting to correct the book in red ink one day while feeling bored. I did actually speak to the author (as I know him on a personal basis). I suggested to him that, should he decide to write any more books, it would be in his best interest to find a new editor who is fluent in the English language and its subtleties related to grammar."
1,Very Scary,I skimmed through this book at a friend's place and was absolutely disgusted. I can't believe anyone could read this piece of junk and believe a word the author says. I totally agree with JP Goodwin's appraisal a) if he really did some of the things he says he did he should be in jail and b)that it is part sleazy bio and part propoganda and part hit piece on people he doesn't like.
2,Very un happy with this,Very in happy with print shop 12.0 it dose not work right and this is my second one. I love all my past print shops very much And so sad that is new one dose not work the way I want it too. I just do not know what to do.
2,Not all that it cracked up to be!,"Star Wars Saga '06 Exclusive Vehicle TIE Fighter with Larger Scale Wings Variant Grey Color with Tie Pilot Action FigureThough the Tie Fighter itself is pretty impressive looking when standing still on a table top or not being played with, this ""toy"" is very fragile and not well constructed. When you lift the toy, the wings sag heavily inwards at the bottom as they don't fit securely in the ejection mounts on either side of the cockpit. This toy is not going to last long in the kid's hands and would recommend only buying it as a display piece at best! Not what I was expecting for a $70.00 toy!"
3,battle descriptions,"This and the Hannibal and Caesar books in the series provide very detailed descriptions of the battles. What is lacking is any kind of analysis of events and battle tactics and, more importantly, there's no synthesis whatsoever that addresses the Origin and Growth of the Art of War, the theme of the series. For that, the first volume of Delbruck's series is more insightful and the four books by Connolly, Hanson, Goldsworthy, and Warry on greek and roman warfare have more illustrative maps."
4,"Not a bad read, tons of information","Theodore Dodge’s publication Alexander chronicles the military history of the world from the “early history of war.” Dodge stresses the importance and value of military history and how it has been the base for strategy on the battlefield ever since military conflict has been recorded. Although the writing may be a little straight forward and boring at times , it is full of useful and interesting information."
4,Awesome book as is though......See below!,"I've bought Theodore Dodge's books: Alexander, Hannibal, Gustavus Adolphus and own Vol. I & II of Napoleon and I will order Volumes 3 & 4 soon enough.Mr. Dodge wrote from a 19th century perspective but his version is an authority indeed.Very compacted information about military campaigns & battles!This IS a military history, not a biography.This is not a nitty gritty tactics book nor extensive describer of Alexander's army.Theodore Dodge does include info. here that is pre-Alexander as well.What this book is, is the chronicling of Alexander's military career via warfare.Buy this book, I doubt you'll find a better one.P.S. Michael Grant, who did the BBC (I believe) special (Circa 2000, maybe) journeyed to the places Alexander went. He also wrote a book on Alexander and said that Dodge's book was WAY more informative and complete than his own written book.If possible watch Grant's documentary & read this book concurrently!Steve K."
1,Another box for the same product already in the market,"I bought this product because in the front page of the box it anounced that it was a Virtual Makeover 2002 version. After installing the product I realized that it was a boundle of Cosmopolitan Virtual Makeover 3 and the Fashion Makeover Deluxe, (both products from year 2000)that information did not appear in the offering of Amazone nor in the description of the software. After searching if there it was a mistake from the Company I realized that in the back of the box with very tyny letters it was something written about the boundle (Amazone doesn't provide information about the back of the box). I recommend that in the future you could be more careful and make the advice to customers saying that ""IF...you have...such product..is the same version"".I`m very dissapointed and I feel they took my money."
5,Onyx Silver Earrings,"I'm delighted with these earrings; I'm wearing them as I type this review. The leverback style means no worries about losing an earring, and the crystals catch the light."
5,kiss all the lawyers ? ? ! !,he can try my case any time he wants -- with this handsome hunk in your court you can't loose!! Lucky Vicki!

4,Whipping Boy Whipped,"The story by Sid Fleischman is, in my opinion, not treated fairly in the video adaption, as is often the case when movies are made from books, the book is much better. I don't know why the people behind the movie felt the need to add extra characters or stray from the story line. Still, the movie is entertaining. Children who have devoured the book can enjoy the movie, noting differences, and deciding for themselves which has more appeal. For me, as it almost always the case, I prefer the book."
1,Prince brat and the whipping boy,This movie really let me and my entire family down it was not even close to anything I or any of my family members would pay free money for let alone hard earned money that we through away on this bogus movie. Its bad enough the republicans steal all the money from the working class now were being taken over the coals by the movie industrie I can only hope this review gets to the poor sap who was going to buy the really bad movie next!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Social-ist history,"Lutes makes history human. He shows it doesn't just happen to people - people do it themselves. 1920s Germany comes alive, and Lutes shows politics wasn't something separate, left to politicians: it was life & death to everyday people. Lutes' Communists & fascists are real, and we feel their motivations. The love affair brought a lump to my throat. City of Stones is proof that education and emotion don't have to be separate.Finally, as a student of socialist history, I can vouch for Lutes' accuracy. The fascist street gangs with their wealthy backers, the communist cooperatives, rising anti-semitism set against revolutionary fervour - it's all there, drawn in beautiful, spare lines."
3,not that great.,"i've been hearing about this book for ten years, as well as rumors of its ""greatness"". so i finally picked it up, and perhaps am feeling let down by its inability to live up to the hype. it is quite good. very good, i'd venture. but it is in no way, shape, or form a ""masterpiece"" or even ""great"". the art itself is magnificent. but the whole story actually just seems ""bored"". not boring, literally bored. it's touted as this dramatic book filled with complex interworkings, and it truly is not. sorry. i wonder if i'll even bother buying the rest (if it ever comes out; Lutes seems to be the slowest artist in comics)."
2,Is it just me?,"I've listened to this cassette several times, and I've been noticing something wrong. It sounds like they are chanting something evil after the album is over, like it's a hidden track with parts of songs mixed in. I'm not sure what to make of it and it is wierding me out. Don't think I can listen again.Other than that problem, the album is just typical stuff. They look like they are trying to be Motley Crue, but sound way lighter. The title track is the best song, there are some other decent work here too, but most of it seems like filler. If you know their history, it makes perfect sense."
2,"""Skip"" this MP3 Boombox",Skips and chirps way too much. Very annoying! Repeats song phrases over and over and over. Has trouble sometimes locating MP3 songs and ends up playing the end of the previous MP3 song. Tried the same CD in another player and plays without any skips or chirps. It doesn't have a shuffle or random mode for your MP3's either. The FM signal is too weak. It's too bad that this is not a good product since it does produce decent sound quality.
1,Not What You Expect!,This system has trouble reading Mp3 CD's as well as commercial audio CD's. It lacks a shuffle feature for the MP3's which means you have to listen to 100 mp3 songs on your CD in alphabetical order. It's definately not what I expected and my expectations were high. I sent it back!
5,Lonnie Hunter is alllllll that!,"Recently Mr. Lonnie Hunter came to our church to do a worship. It was very unfortunate he could only spend two days with us. He has a great personality and can really really sing. He really blessed my soul with his songs. His cd is all that. My favorites are of course Even Me (Drip Drop), I'm Not Tired Yet, Shout Yes! and This is My Prayer.Nekole reppin Mount Vernon Baptist Church in Louisville, Ky."
4,Great descriptions and pictures,"I like this book for blood cell maturation pictures and descriptions. I really like the spriral binding for ease of use. The only complaint that I have is that it does not use all three origins for describing the cells, even if the infrequently used names were in parentheses, it would be better than eliminating them entirely, i.e. Proerythroblast (pronormoblast, rubriblast). I had to write all over the book including all of the naming conventions, so I thought they should have been included."
3,Cat Coore mon!!,"Ok, I just bought this disc. Anyway, a decent album if your a fan of Third World and want to own everything. Cat gets some help from his Third World croonies on this one. I just wish there was more guitar on the songs. Too much of this CD comes off with way too much keyboards. Good version of ""uptown rebel"" on this, plus other good tracks like ""Jah sun you rise"" and ""easy Mr. bond""."
3,The Best Songs Solid Time-Pieces,"The second album from the Nice has its moment but its also characterized by the same limitations as group's debut album. They were never really great songwriters, though some of their best songs are actually quite solid time-pieces. Vocally group also had difficulties with catching up with contemporary big names such as Traffic, Cream or Procol Harum.I quite like the first three songs ""Daddy Where did I Come From"" ( somehow the melody line reminds me of Blur ), ""Little Arabella"" and ""Happy Freuds"" - all three psychedelia with a little touch of classical.But who needs the Nice's version of the Karelia suite, which like the original side two of the album just feels longwinded.The Brandenburger part of ""Ars Longa Vita Brevis"" is great, though. But the single version is in fact identical to it, so you don't have to sit through the whole 19.20 minutes."
4,Great short book on relationships by a best-selling author and psychiatrist,"I think this little book is a gem. It covers relationship basics, what I would call Relationship 101 skills such as setting goals, how to reach agreements, handling conflict and dealing with infidelity.The author uses a very direct common sense approach and gets down to the nuts and bolts of what makes a relationship work. As a personal coach who deals with people having trouble in relationships, I find this a useful reference."
3,The deodorant was okay. Although it was supposedly ...,"The deodorant was okay. Although it was supposedly anti-perspirant, I felt that it didn't work 100% all the time. It had no smell, something I wasn't used to, but it was pretty good. However, I still prefer my old deodorant (Arm & Hammer) to this one."
3,Beware of white streaks,"The other reviewers here have either ingested large amounts of this deodorant or have been planted by the vendor. While this product is effective at keeping odor and sweat at bay, it still leaves behind an annoying white residue that looks bad when it dries on clothing. There is a method of avoiding the white streaks that I have devised, and it involves pulling the bottom portion of your shirt forward and deftly maneuvering the deodorant upward through the resulting shirt tunnel, finally making contact at one's armpits. Basically, applying it after--not before--equipping your shirt. I still use it consistently only because it is available at a store that is located minutes from my house and always has them on sale."
4,"Since I live in Honolulu, I can provide ...","Since I live in Honolulu, I can provide an effectiveness rating for this product any time of the year. I'd say that both as an antiperspirant and a deodorant it works just as well as other similar products I've tried. But, while it's """"unscented,"""" I wouldn't say that it's odorless going on. It has a fragrance that resembles latex house paint (the closest comparison I can find), which isn't very strong but doesn't dissipate entirely either. I think in close contact situations, one might prefer a little added fragrance. For ordinary use for those who don't like perfume, this product could be recommended."
2,I Dont Get It,"I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 because I am thinking there is something here I am not grasping. According to my Kindle I am 70% of the way through this book and it is incredibly boring. There were some brief points of profound observation, and some brief areas where the author did a nice job of describing the landscape and the people who inhabit it, but overall this book is boring."
1,Ramblings of an old man,"""big sur and the oranges of Heronymos bosch"" is just the ramblings of an old henry Miller trying to remember different things that have happened to him. A complete waste of time."
4,Miller's reflections on a place,"This is a satisfying read if you appreciate language and character. It is a collection of views and vignettes of the author's life when he lived in Big Sur. Miller's unique personality and interests come through in his language that makes even ordinary things come more to life. It was interesting to discover what seemed like proto-new age thinking in some of this, written in the 1950's. His evocations of character are great and so is the feel of the environment. I read part of the book during a trip that took me through Big Sur, and it deepened my enjoyment of being there. The Henry Miller Library is worth visiting."
4,The music never dies...,"What a fun book! Like everyone else in the book, the music of 'our time' never dies - everytime I hear one of those songs, I'm back!"
1,Bad Shipment and quality,"The music is simply mesmerizing (particularly, the raga manj khamaj); however, the quality of the cd is haunting and the condition of the case is horrible. There are no scratches on the cd; however, it does not play properly for almost a minute at the 65th minute mark of the 1st cd (the one that contains the raga khamaj). It's extremely disappointing. The case is broken at the corner - I think because of the bad shipment without any padding. The product arrived well before the delivery date mentioned in the order.If you like to own this great piece, buy it from somewhere else."
2,"A good read during a ""cargo dispatch"", then flush it","This book would be a great resource for aspiring mystery, suspense or porn writers. From the stages of rigor mortis to squeamish curiosities, it's all covered, or uncovered, as the case may be. Some items are not appropriate for non-adults -- excerpts describing photos from Madonna's sex book, excerpts describing graphic murders from American Psycho... there's a reason people avoid these items. Choice. For reference or amusement purposes only, but be warned, some items warrant skipping to retain your lunch. Received as a joke gift; not a self-chosen purchase."
2,There is fascinating stuff but too far and few between,"I was frankly disappointed by this book. There's too much ""filler"" and too much stuff that is too specialized. For example, I'm not a ""Three Stooges"" fan and the FIRST entry was some weird detail about their antics. Besides, this is TV- it's not real. To be ""odd"" I think it should probably be ""strange but true"". Several good topics were about the messages in records, the idiot savants, and some others but on the whole the book was fair and the listings quite arbitrary. I do like his Woody Allen book, though."
1,A totally waste of useless facts,"I bought this book waiting to find really interesting and unusual facts.Hard was my disappointment when one of the author's odd things was to point out almost a hundred different ways to name the sexual intercourse, for instance.The book is plagued with ridiculous things that if desired would be found on the Internet but which not merit to write a book.In my opinion do not spend a dime on this book. Instead, if you want to read more about curious and exotic things, I would reccommend Cecil Adams' Straight dope or the best one in these fields: Isaac Asimov."
3,Definitely not for the general audience..!!!,"This book is really funny. I am one for the wild, weird and the odd things that hit us everyday but if this book was edited for general audience it would definitely be a huge seller. It delves too much into sexual contexts (which it shd not) and too much importance is given to the weird sexual facts and practises.There are definitely some very funny odd things in the book but overall its definitely an R rated book !!!"
1,good movie lousy dvd,"For starters this dvd isn't widescreen. It's full frame. The movie has both the original french language track and a lousy English dub, but no subtitles. So unless your French is very good, you are stuck with the vastly inferior English track. The movie itself is cool kinda a cross between Slap Shot, The Full Monty and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."
3,okay,"""You get what you pay for."" The paint job is very pretty. The fingerboard was unplayable, since the strings at the nut were set too close together; I had to have that repaired. It actually has a good sound, much better than one would expect. I also use a different bow and a better case, and I use a barcus berry pickup which sounds very good on this cheap fiddle. Satisfactory for the price - and looks very cool! I'm happy with it."
5,A great background for the origins of earth and life,"This book gives the technically literate but non-specialist reader an excellent background for the origin of the earth and life on it, along with the same for other planets. It has what I feel is a perfect mix of qualitative and quantitative material. The author is not afraid to use equations and graphs to complete an idea, but the essentials are clear without them. My cosmology book club consisting of an MD, a PhD, engineers, and non-techncal folks is enjoying discussing it. The various measurements that can search for life on other planets are well described."
3,THIS IS FOR DOGS.... A SPRAY FOR ANIMALS,What this doesn't say is that it's for animals!! The name does say PetKin though. BUT it does smell good and I spray it like air freshner and even used as a body spray on myself. The scent don't last long any way you use it. But yes it does smell like green apples! Hope this helps...
3,Havent Read it yet but.....,"I haven't read this book yet, but I was wondering.... Does it have pictures? If so, how do we distinguish the human diarrheas from the animals? Do they lable the poops?THis book just seems too bizzare. I'd love to know what was like from someone who read it."
2,movies,Movies were short and lack a proper Thomas plot...would not recommend.We were very disappointed in the quality of the movies.
4,3 great Thomas movies at a good price,"I didn't know where to start our Thomas collection so chose this. In retrospect, the movie titles are not the perfect choice for our 17mo (too long) but we do enjoy putting them in for long trips. The movies themselves have good values, Great place to start our Thomas collection!"
2,Disappointing,"This book simply does not live up to its hype. I expected a more informative book and was, sad to say, disappointed."
4,solid steel,Sharper than what came with my original Wahl razor. It was easy to remove the old one and install the new one.
3,Fast delivery,"These clipper blades as in most I have found, do not last like the original ones as in sharpness. They tend to dull quite quickly but they do work."
4,good thing it has a shaver too..,"keep in mind that this is my first epilator, but i was surprised at how loud it is. i was also surprised at how many hairs it would miss, therefore making it essential to shave afterwards as well as time consuming. i was amazed at the terrible amount of in-grown hairs i recieved after starting to use this product, and that is why i only use the shaver attachment now."
5,Better than expected.... and I expected a lot...,I am extremely satisfied with my new Braun 3370. It works better than previous Braun models and it is more efficient. It can be used almost all over your body... my legs feel nice now for a longer time and even my bikini line suffered great improvements. It is worth it every penny!
3,Braun 3370 Silk Epil SoftPerfection Epilator,"It's fine, the first one I've ever had, so I don't know how to review it. My friend who recommended epilators to me has used them for 15 years tried it, and she's buying one. Most of the attachments didn't seem to make much difference, but my hair is very thin and not hard to pull out.It has two attachments meant to help with the epilator's contact with the skin and efficiency. Another attachment functions as a shaver (for touch up?) and trimmer for cutting longer hair down to optimal length for epilating. That attachment is handy for any shaving and trimming needed, so the tool is more versatile."
4,"Pain in the @ss, but works","I bought this for my drag show, I represent Tina Turner on the show so I needed smooth legs for this. Is painful but GREAT."
5,Love it!! HURTS BUT WORKS!,"Definitely have to go with the Braun Epilator... NOT EPILADY! It works... much better than waxing... much neater & quicker. Just have to get used to the PULLING sensation! One hair at a time... I use it on my arms & toes. ew. Lasts longer than waxing & you can use it when the hairs are VERY short. Also has an electric razor attachment with a guard. GREAT! Easy to clean. Great quality. GET IT!! Doesn't really leave red marks afterwards, like I thought it would."
4,Great Home Epilator,"This is a great, reliable, easy to use epilator. The attachments make it much less painful than previous models. It would be nice if the European version with all attachments such as shaving head were available in the U.S., and if this model would have dual voltage for travel. Overall a great product."
5,This product has changed my life.,"I've always had very coarse, thick hairy on my legs that grows in swirls so it is almost impossible to get a perfect shave. My hair also grows extremely quickly (as in the night of having shaved there is almost always regrowth). This is extremely strange since I am half Japanese and half French (my French side happens to be very hairy).This product has changed my life and I will never ever need to shave with a razor again. Not only does it pick up even the tiniest stubble, but the hair has been growing back lighter, less severe, and the results are just fabulous - smooth silky legs. Please buy this!"
5,It definitely works!!,"I have never used an epilator before. I found this one to be easy to use. I could not use it on my underarms, however. It was way too painful. Everywhere else, it is fine."
3,I don't know what to think!,This thing hurts like hell! I have read all the reviews. I am trying to work with it. I hear how it pays off in the end. I have stuble from trying to hurry up LOL I read over the reviews again today. I am going to give it a few days and try again. ANKLES OUCH! BACK OF LEGS OUCH! Everything else seems so so. Anyone buying this. GOOD LUCK. It hurts and I usually take pain pretty good!
4,First time buyer,"If you are a first time buyer/user, do read a sample of reviews - it will help a lot in the decision making process. I thank everybody who have contributed their reviews, as it helped me make my decision. As for the product, this is the perfect thing to use when in between the waxing stages. If you are used to waxing, there is no pain. I have been waxing for the past 5 years and the pain was no more then what I experience while waxing. However, if you have never waxed before you will feel a bit of a prick and redness. Lower legs are definitely much easier to do than the upper legs - but hold you skin taut and you will be fine. The biggest challenge is figuring out how fast to move the epilator - initially I ended up breaking my hair rather than pulling it out. I definitely recommend waxing before using this product. This way you are only dealing with so much hair at a time."
2,Doesn't work well,"It only got about 60% of the hairs, even after I went over an area many many times. And many of the hairs just broke off and didn't get pulled, leaving stubble. So I tried an experiment: I did one leg with the epilator and one leg with the electric razor attachment that it comes with. The epilated leg was only slightly smoother than the razored leg-both were left quite prickly. Very disappointing. I will not use it again."
2,Sloooooooow and not very effective,"I've used this product twice since buying it, and am pretty disappointed. I got used to the pain, but it took hours just to do (most of) my legs, because you have to go so slow. Additionally, I noticed that both times I had stubble the next day, which indicates that it is merely breaking some of the hair off at the skin, not taking out the bulb. So it takes a comparatively huge amount of time and is less effective than shaving or waxing. I would recommend waxing, and then using the epilator to get the hairs that waxing missed."
2,meh,its ok but not my favorite item...it is very time consuming and very painful (i know i have no pain tolerance but still). furthermore it gives me terrible in grown hair. i bought it a year ago and ive pretty much stopped using it
4,Good product,"My previous epilator broke after 6 years of use, so I had to get a new one... this new version is pretty good, but I found that my previous epilator (Silk Epil, Braun) was slightly better."
2,Little Devil,"To confirm other reviews, this works quite well. But no quality of hair removal is worth this pain. It is truly incredible. Consider I am a guy and I used it on my face. It works well in removing all the hair but it hurts so ungodly horrible that I'd never recommend it to anyone. So the results are great, but the ends do not justify the means. Go get a really powerful cream, wax, something besides this product. I'll be sending it back."
4,It's worth buying!,"If you are new to epilation, you will find it painful in the beginning. I had experienced the same when I bought it. I never wanted to try it again after the first attempt. But, the second time, I tried it and it was not that worse and I was able to epilate my legs. I think anyone will get used to the pain gradually and you might never notice the pain one day! It's really worth since you dont have to try all those razors in the bath tub every other day. I can't say my skin is perfect smooth with epilation, but it's a LOT better when compared to shaving. I give it 4 stars!!"
3,"Okay, not great","If you are like me and have coarser hair on your legs, this is not a great product. It does hurt like crazy the first few times, but you do get used to it and then it is no longer painful. The big issue for me is that I do not get those weeks of hairless legs and so I end up using it often. Not much better than shaving in that regard."
4,works well but wish it were more powerful,"It does work and it does seem to pull the hair -however short it is- from its roots. The shaver head works better but hair grows back faster this way. It's OK but not the best epilation product I've ever used. I used to have Epilady by Braun which worked much better. Neither the ""4-way moving pain softener"" nor the ""efficiency pro clip"" is necessary for me. Being used to hot wax I don't feel pain. Without the pain softener gadget it still does not hurt at all (experience based on legs only). I only wish Silk Epil were more powerful. You need to go either very slowly or go over the same place several times. Despite all the negative things I wrote it is the best product I found in the market. Let me know if you find something better. Carrying pouch is stylish and is handy to keep all the pieces together."
4,A little bit tight.,"Shipping is perfect. And the item is match my requirement. Although it is hard to put it on the wheel, I like it."
3,"Not bad, but Glutose 45 is better","I bought this for my son who has frequent lows. I purchased the 31-g tubes as an alternative to the 45-g tubes of Glutose 45 and because the price per g was half as much. Unfortunately, he told me (1) the tubes are not as easy to open as Glutose, (2) the tube can not be reclosed if he doesn't use the entire dose, (3) it's much thicker and more difficult to extract from the tube than Glutose. While it gets the job done, and isn't a bad product, when he's low enough to need glucose, he wants something he can actually get open and into him more easily than this product. Last time I checked, Glutose 45 is not available on Amazon."
3,Tastes Gross but works for SCUBA Diving,"This stuff tastes like nothing I've ever tasted before -- it's sickly sweet but not in a pleasant way -- not tart like Dex4 tabs or refreshing like some liquids. It also doesn't work as fast but very nearly.That said it's a must for diabetic SCUBA divers who might experience hypoglycemia while diving -- it takes a little practice but you can use it underwater so you don't have to surface if you start feeling the hypoglycemic slump coming on. A tube of this and a little moderation of activity and you can avoid a full-on blood sugar crash. No muss, no fuss, no emergency in the water.NOT recommended for people who can't feel the drop or are not aware when they are hypoglycemic. Divers' Alert Network has more info on DWD (Diving While Diabetic)."
3,Killington,It said the book was new . There was damage on the binding and some of the pages were damaged.
4,Richard Robbins is a highly underrated composer,"Before I set out to write my own remarks of this spectacular collection, I read through the other reviews and realized that ""tdewey"" hit the nail on the head precisely. MAURICE prevails as the best of the three, especially with its haunting choral track (#5) and the opening theme that reverberates with emotion. As for A ROOM WITH A VIEW, track #2 is a magnificent orchestral rendition of track #1. In fact, it is a variation that epitomizes Robbins's ability to take something that is already terribly beautiful and turn it into something twice as powerful and mesmerizing.There are few truly original composers alive today. Ryuichi Sakamoto is one. Angelo Badalamenti is another. Robbins has earned his rightful place among them."
5,award-winning Merchant Ivory soundtrack,"This box set is great, especially the music for ""A Room with a View."" This is exquisite, elegant melody-making, combined with a great sense of atmosphere as well. This music really made the scenes in the films come to life! Now when I hear these tracks, I'm transported back to scenes in the film, like Lucy exploring Florence, or standing at th embankment of the Arno river with George, Lucy and Sistel at the ""Sacred Lake"" where they shared a very awkward kiss in the film (hahaha), etc etc.Very enjoyable.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
3,"good, but not great","This is a good read, but somewhere around the second half of the book, it loses a little. The main characters whining and fantasizing both get a little tedious. And the final punch of seeing her brother again loses a bit when it comes right after a supposedly real meeting with Abe Lincoln. Are both encounters fantasy?"
2,Only 3 pages with tips on how to apply!,I thought that this book in addition to description of the work and life onboard provides detailed information on how to write a cover letter and resume as well as to pass an interview. Unfortunately all I found about this were 3 pages with common sense tips. I think that instead of having 15 caricatures and funny pictures long 1/2-1 page the author had to provide detailed information on these 3 crucial for successful applying topics. That's why if you really want to get a cruise ship job search for another book.
2,Misleading Title!,"The title of the book is ""How to get a job with a cruise line"". However this is NOT at all what the author is talking about. The book is full with mainly autobiographical stories, which don't give any insider information. These people have had a hired relative, nearby office of a cruise line, 14 years experience or something similar. This makes them useless for the typical applicants who have to rely entirely on the quality of their cover letter and resumes. With only few pages mainly common sense tips on writing and applying this book can only tell you what is onboard BUT NOT and how to get there!"
2,Not enough specific information,"This book give a basic overview of how to go about obtaining cruise line employment. However, the information is not specific enough and DOES NOT GIVE STEP BY STEP DIRECTIONS ON PREPARING A COVER LETTER AND RESUME. And that's the main thing I had hoped to learn from buying the book."
4,How to get a job with a cruise line,"I've read the book cover to cover 3 times and still found new points of interest each time. I did find it was a little outdated because not all it referenced is current, ie: contacts, vessels, destinations. All in all, an great guide for the cruising novice. It gave advice that I would have never thought of!"
2,Needs updating,The addresses and contact information are old and of little use. Needs up dating. I would not recommend this book to others.
3,Especially good for those right out of school,"The book contains a great deal of information, but the author takes a lot of space describing how to be professional in your phone calls, letters, applications, resumes, interviews, etc. This info is invaluable for the first-timer who is not familiar with job-hunting, but for those who have been working for some time, this is old hat.What I found most valuable is the careful descriptions of the cruiselines. However, the book was published pre-9/11, so there is no reference to how the world and the travel industry have changed since then, or how the disaster affected the cruise industry. Perhaps in the next edition the author will include this assessment.Bottom line: buy it. You'll find something useful."
4,Great product,"I love this product so it's great. The longer you leave it in your hair, the better you hair looks and feels. It is concentrated so you don't have to use that much."
3,Not better than cheap stuff.,"First off, let me say this is a good product. It does make my hair feel silkier, which probably means healthier. However, I've used Kolesterol brand hair cream for decades, but when life changed and I could afford some more expensive products I chose to try something else. Really, while this LOreal product is good, there's no reason to spend so much money when you can go to a local Sally Beauty supply and pick up some Kolesterol for a fraction of the price."
3,Not as great as I hoped.,"After reading the reviews here I was very excited to order L'Oreal's Professional Series Absolut Repair Masque (I also ordered the shampoo/conditioner.) I've been using all three products for four days now and I haven't noticed any different in my hair whatsoever. I have VERY dry hair. It's frizzy, and extremely prone to breakage. Previously I was just using TRESemme shampoo/conditioner and a spray leave-in conditioner, and I think that combo worked just as great as this line of products. However, TRESemme is significantly less expensive. I wouldn't reccomend this line."
1,"Not worth it, my hair looked the same....","My hair looked the same as when I use my cheap conditioner. I do recommend Loreal power dose, this really works."
5,Bring on the the 60's,"He is pumped, classy and cool all in one. Many have tried to imitate, but never has anyone succeeded. Listening to him gives meaning to the word ""pop"".This album is recommended to anyone who is willing to get highly involved in music."
5,He's a hit,"A great compilation of his hits, and these are the originals. Not only do I enjoy listening to it, but my wife does, too. That means it's a really good buy."
3,Duet with Sarah Brightman in 1995,"This Tom Jones guy was to have sung with Aretha, Enrique, Sting, and Bocelli on New Year's Eve, but they never will."
3,Best Of Features Some Best Of Tom Jones,"One in a long line of recently released ""Best Of"" collections, this 22 song compilation focuses on Tom Jones hit singles, paying little attention to album cuts. That in itself isn't really bad, although it means some songs considered ""less quality"" than others gain inclusion. All of the ""standard hits"" are included, such as ""It's Not Unusual"", ""What's New Pussycat?"", ""She's A Lady"", ""Delilah"", ""Green,Green Grass Of Home"", ""I'll Never Fall In Love Again"", and ""Without Love (There Is Nothing)"". These of course were Top 10 or Top 20 hits in both the states and in England. Some memorable Jones songs such as ""Say You'll Stay Until Tomorrow"" (#15 US Singles Charts, 1977) are not included. Still, as with most of the Tom Jones ""Best Ofs"" out there curently, there are a handful of songs not often carried on CD accompanied by a slew of hit singles almost always available. At the very least, this a good collection of notable hit singles."
2,Bland and unremarkable,"I'm a big fan of Kawasaki. Hindsights is, however, a disappointment. The stories are bland. The insights are cliché - Never give up. Be Honest. Believe in your dream.Each chapter is about a different person and their wisdom and breakthroughs. However, the chapters are too short and too superficial to draw you in and make you care about the person, which makes their revelations seem unremarkable. It's a great idea for a book, but it's poorly executed in this offering."
2,Way too expensive,"The content of this book may be great, but this tiny tome is not worth $.... No way. I bought it used, and trust me the $50 it cost was too much. In the outrageous textbook market $50 would have been steep for a new book, but I suppose they could make a case for it. If you pay $... dollars for this book, you are going to be a very unhappy camper when it arrives, regardless of content."
3,Not that impressive,"I'm not as impressed by this book as other reviewers are. The first few pages of the book sounded more like writing from a children's book. It would really take a skillful writer to turn this into a screenplay unless you are talking about a Disney movie. It's not giving much historical background for the Barbary ""corsairs"". And, yes it is ""corsairs"" that should be used to describe North African privateers not ""pirates"". There is indeed a difference. I would definitely recommend instead Stanley Lane-Poole's ""The Story of the Barbary Corsairs"" which was available from Amazon at some point. That is a more comprehensive and enlightening book than Forester's."
5,Excellent Choice,"If you are looking for well written, easy to follow recipe book on Fondues this is it.Among several great recipes I would recommend the crab meat and cheese and the several chocolate recipes."
3,"Great Packaging, Horrible Remastering!","This is a really great shame. The idea was a good one: to remaster and repackage this classic album adding the bonus ""Clover Sessions"" disc to boot. The irony is that the mastering and hence the sound quality on the bonus disc far outshines that of the main course, disc 1! The bass is overpowering on the first disc and the sound so muddy that even the original version didn't sound as bad as this! Track 5, ""Work To Do"" is the worst of the lot and is just unbelievably bad. Sony have a lot of work to do just to fix the damage done on the first disc. Too bad they didn't release the Clover Sessions separately otherwise you could get that alone and some other version of disc one. Overall verdict: 0 stars for Disc 1, 3 stars for Disc 2."
2,Why the price so high,"8 used from $910.74Whether they are sending the ""English"" Teacher also along with the book? Hopefully I think I am correct otherwise they wont charge $910.......Technology is growing now in all the directions"
4,A Tragic Life,What a tragic life - anyone interested in human psychology will get a wild ride with this one. One can only guess what a different life she would have led if Jack was more involved in her life.
4,Princess of the Beats,"Forget the last name and the heritage, this is a well written book about a life fully lived and extremely tragic at times. She met with her father rarely, but she inherited much. His lifestyle became her's and she was the embodiment of the Hippie spirit of the 1960's. The book begins with her having a miscarriage in Mexico and doesn't get much happier. The style and lifestyle are close to her father's but she is much more. It is not just a feminist view or emerging feminist view, it is story of a person on an adventure. She is one of the first feminist voices to come out of the Woodstock generation and asserts herself with this book. If you are looking for a happy read forget it. But Jan's first book is a great look into two different emerging voices and movements. For any fan of the Beats this is a nice step into the next generation."
4,Baby Driver,"Interesting, if not sad, stories by and about Jack Kerouac's daughter. Do we indeed pay for the sins of our father's?"
5,Super Product,"Hey-let me tell you this is a great tow bike. I am a novice rider and just wanted to keep up with our 9 year old and this allows me and our 4 year old to go along. It is easy to put together and I can quickly detach if neccessary. With the third seat down in my minivan I can fit the tow bike, two adult bikes and a jr bike into the back. My bike handles well with the 45lbs in tow and i find that it takes minimal adjustment for one to learn how to corner. Have fun!!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"We bought this to replace a long-used similar product, as our youngest is just to the age to pedal on her own. We have enjoyed our past trailer bike, but this one had two manufacturing defects right out of the box. The tire would not hold air, and the clip for the safety flag was the wrong size. The box also contained a note that the bolt for the bike seat was too short, and they included a new bolt. There was no extra flag clip or tire tube. I didn't bother hooking it to the bike to see what else might be wrong. The frame seemed solid, and judging by the other positive reviews it may be I just got one assembled late on a Friday afternoon (hence a second charity star), but this one in definitely going back in the box. Some of the reviews mentioned wobbling and trouble with turns, but having had another trailer, this is not normal. This one may be budget priced for a reason."
4,This product maintains dryness and is easy to ...,This product maintains dryness and is easy to use. It leaves no white residue but I found the scent to be unpleasant.
4,I believe it kept me dry similar to ...,"I believe it kept me dry similar to other products, but there were two things that I found I disliked. First, the odor of the product was overpowering, even after an hour or two. I don't like the girly smell. Also, after applying the product, it would get on any pullover shirt. Beyond these two dislikes, I believe the product was very good and did what it was supposed to do."
1,this is pretty awful,"most collections of poetry i find hard to be anything but ambivalent about, so i get real excited when i come across a great collection. i can even get excited about coming across a collection as bad as this one. at least it makes me feel something. the topics are banal or preachy. bottum has only the most basic grasp of form and what he does know is used ineffectively."
5,It was the Best!!!,"I liked it because I had more disignes to pick from, I also had a fun time with it and that is all that matters."
2,united cutlery neck knife,this thing is pretty cheaply made but for what you pay for it its still a great deal and it will do the job that it was designed for
2,Incomplete Order,When I received the order from Amazon it was missing all of the hardware to install it as well as 2 out of the 5 main parts. Beware when ordering this.
2,Difficult to USE,"I got 2 college degrees (not in music), but I dont' understand the terminology. They need to make the directions user friendly. They are not. If you can't get someone to explain what the instructions are saying, I'd recommend just buying a sequencer that does not require a degree in music to figure out how it works.Problem 1: Could not hear music, a week later I finally figured this out.Problem 2: Going on 10 weeks. Can't record music."
1,Crap support with a burn out,"Long story short, very un-impressed by their support. The interface made a loud buzzing noise when plugged into usb only. AC plug fixed that for a while, but then it finally burnt out and wouldn't turn on. Called, emailed tech support, no response at all. Boo"
2,Preamps are junk,"Preamps are low gain and noisy. Latency isn't that good either for a firewire interface. At the 2ms setting, I get 14 ms total latency (measured using centrance ltu...google it). I'd recommend skipping this one."
3,Beware of the red light,"It's nice except for the fact that every week or so, the red light comes on and it stops working. Good luck getting it to work again. The same thing doesn't work every time. Sometimes, you can unplug it for a few seconds and plug it back in. Other times, you have to unplug it, go into the device manager and uninstall the firewire driver, turn your computer off (don't restart, just turn off all the way), plug it in, and turn the computer on again. Everything is great except for the red light problem. Just do a search for ""firebox red light"" on google and you'll see it's a very common problem. I've used this thing for two years and it still happens on a regular basis. Because of that, I give it three starts because it can totally ruin your day (or days)."
1,beware of the firewire ports !!!!!!!!!!!,"My firewire ports a totally useless, l have to get it fixed. No longer are my wonderful AKG stereo stick mics working because there are bad connections in the Presonus Firebox firewire ports.Be very aware when buying this product. It seems like they make it with not solid workmanship. It will work for a while then get loose over time.Be very aware of those firewire ports !Not even sure if I will pay to get it fixed or buy another type of interface. I really don't want to buy this product again, because of both ports being faulty !"
2,Presonus FireBox,Bad experience with Cubase LE 4 that comes with it. Suffering from bad dropouts. Tried everything with all the settings recommended. Downloaded the updated version from Steinberg but it failed to recognize the LCC licence control so I have to downgrade and got stuck with it. I have not got a single satisfactory recording done yet. I am looking at trying the Firebox with other recording software.
4,Good bang for the buck,"I am very happy with this box. I bought it along with the E-mU Xboard 49 Controller and between the two I've had my hands full learning Cubase LE (bundled with the firebox) and sifting through the 2,000 or so sounds that the Xboard bundles with ProteusX LE. It is more than enough for an entry-level home studio. It's a blast being able to record through the MIDI and hooking up the guitar to the Firebox and layering in new tracks. My only complaint is that I have to turn the gain almost all the way up when I hook up my electric guitar but it's not a problem. Maybe other things will come up as I learn more and do more advanced things with it but by then I'll probably want to graduate to a next-level product anyway. Great box to start with without exceeding my budget. By the way, amazon has it for less than any of the reputable internet dealers that I've bought from before and that I went to first when shopping around for this. Delivery was faster than what was anticipated."
4,"Good, but do your research first","I got this product because a buddy has the Audiobox, which is the USB version of this. I like the sound of the mic pre's in it, so I went ahead and got this one, instead of just buying a mic pre. I had a serious amount of trouble with low gain output on this. I was pulling my hair out an finally found the issue on Presonus's website. In order to be compliant with Apple's firewire power standards, they had to lower the voltage rails on this device. This results in a MUCH lower output than its USB counterpart, This would be ok, with a condenser mic, but with a quiet mic like an SM57, you actually have to buy an ADDITIONAL preamp to boost the gain. If I'd know this, I wouldn't have bought this to begin with. So....it IS a good piece of equipment and the A?D conversion quality is nice. But be aware of its limitations."
4,Great entry level interface. Preamps not enough power.,"Overall this is a nice little device. I have had trouble getting it to work well with Cakewalk Music Creator, but it works very well with the StudioOne software that comes with it. I have come to really like StudioOne as well since it is really easy to use and works well with presonus hardware.My only complaint with this device is that the preamps don't have enough juice. I have to crank them almost all the way up and apply the software 10db boost in order to get my dynamic mic to peak. The mic I use is pretty cheap, so maybe if I had a higher quaily condenser I'd have better luck, but if you are going to be using a cheap dynamic for vocal work or soft instruments, you may want to look into something different. That said, it is passable as long as you don't mind using the software based boost.For the price, I think this is about the best Audio Interface you will find."
5,Great Product!,"I am using this with a AKG Perception 200 mic, and an ART pre amp. The sound is AMAZING. After listening to my brother use it and play it back, and working with it myself, I found that the sound is pretty much exactly what goes in. It even sounds a little better. I only found one problem. It has phantom power, but if you want to get your power from this box, be warned that the adapter makes a really high-pitched squeal (The same thing that many other adapters do, but I notice it pretty well in a quiet room). If you want to use it for power, make sure it's on the other side of the door."
4,Fun!!,"The Family Guy Monopoly has been great fun and we all enjoy the different things that relate to the show. I've played Monopoly for years, but seeing in such a fun and unique way has been great!"
4,very enjoyable,Very enjoyable. Love the historical aspects and how they thought back in the old days. Wish Milne had written more mysteries.
2,"Great Story, Bad Book","I have read this book before purchasing this copy. I love it! The book by A.A. Milne is great! However, this copy is not. The book is very large and thin. It looks like a book that one would find in the desk of a schoolchild. I wasn't impressed. I've returned the book and I am going to look for a better copy."
3,The Red House,"Interesting mystery that holds your attention all the way to the end. The main characters are developed enough that you are guessing almost to the end as to ""who did it"" and ""who did it to whom"". I did enjoy it quite a lot; the plot and interation of the characters remind me of an Agatha Christy mystery, which I throughly appreciate. Well worth the time."
2,Started but did not finished.,I love a mystery but this book failed to capture my attention. At times I was lost. I guess it is just the style of writing.
2,If you Like Slow!,"This book was interesting and then way too slow at times, Good twist in the story line but took too long to get there.I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF FINISH IT."
2,Not really for adults,"When I was a child I read all the Hardy Boys mysteries I could get my hands on. They were written for a very young adult audience and, being a young adult then, I enjoyed them. This is also the case with this work. It seems to be written for an even younger audience and for me, now, I found it dragged and was VERY repetitive. The interplay between Bill and Anthony was annoying and had an almost homoerotic element to it (not that there's anything wrong with that!). A.A. Milne wrote great children's books and, in my opinion, that's what he should have stuck to."
2,It's not Winnie the Pooh,"I thought, gee, he wrote the Pooh books and so I got the book. He should have stuck with Pooh. The writing was what I expected, but the endless re hashing of the events got to me. Would it never end? This would have made a very good short, short story, it needed large amounts of editing. Sort of like almost any book you pick up these days, 250 page is a book not 800."
2,confusing story,"i kept waiting for something to really happen and when it didn't, I didn't finish the book. I waded through about 2 chapters and gave up."
2,Score 1,A very interesting and fast read. Perfect for the beach. Interesting setting and detailing of the era. Plot was a little thin.
3,The Red Mystery,"The Red House Mystery by A.A Milne was a mystery set in the late 1900's. The story was about a lady named Miss Stevens in the red house. There is a man or a woman that is killing people, so the public has to try and figure out who did it, when and how. This is probably one of the best mystery stories I have ever read. This book really had a lot of suspense and surprising points. I think you'll be very shocked about what happens at the end. I recommend this book to whoever likes mysteries or who is at a high school level."
1,This is a great novel for a ten year old.,I have the extreme misfortune of having to read this book for a literary research paper. Author intrusion in a mystery novel is a horrible thing. Mr milne should have stuck with pooh.
3,Red House Mystery,This was an easy and fast read. A bit wordy at times but basically an enjoyable break from heavy reading.
4,The Mystery of Red House,"Very intriguing ""cozy"" mystery al. Christi, Sawyers etc. where the focus is on who did it and how. Well written although not as good as his children's books. [[ASIN:1619491354 The Red House Mystery]"
3,Slow but interesting,"Ok, I'll say this first. The book moves rather slowly. In fact, I had to make myself keep reading it over a few pages. Once Gillingham and Bill get together with each other it's a lot more entertaining. It never achieves greatness but (in my opinion) don't think the author was aiming for the ultimate literary mystery masterpiece. I think he was writing a nice, light mystery with a dash of humour thrown in. I'm not even sure if it had been intended to be published, the dedication pretty much days that he wrote it solely for his father. I did take one star away because a few times 'Antony' becomes 'Anthony' and the chapters could have been spaced a little better. Which is a common problem with the ""digitized by a community of volunteers"". These volunteers must have no idea of spelling, grammar or formatting."
4,A fun read,"I am enjoying a number of period piece detective novels. This was among them.If someone tried to write a novel of this time, it would ring false. Since it was written years ago, the wording and descriptions are ideal. Milne took the time to explain the thinking processes along the way which helped me follow his reasoning.If you liked this, try Mary Roberts Rhinehart"
4,I enjoyed it,I even recommended this book to my book club. What a great satirical look at mysteries from the author that brought us Winnie the Pooh. I will caution you that it is a classic and therefore has an older style of writing. Don't expect a fast paced thrill ride. It is an easy read with easy characters to get along with.
4,A fun read,"This is an interesting bit of amateur sleuthing.The main characters making fun of the Holmes/Watson dynamic is amusing. Also a solid amount of humor to it.The motivation for the murderer is also interesting.Get the free Kindle version if you like a mystery, and give this a try."
3,It was OK.,"This book is a classic ""locked room"" mystery. Although it started interestingly enough, it seemed to bog down occasionally with just too many details, causing me to lose interest. I did finish it, but it was not one of the best mysteries I have read."
2,good sharp knife//handle to thick for kneck knife,I wanted a neck knife for when I was camping / fishing. The blade is shard enough but the handle is too thick-but I was able to take off the plastic handles so all was not lost.
3,Framed all around a missing X factor,This is the competent though rarely triumphant sound of Davis breaking off fan's expectations gently from his previous accidental masterwork.
2,"sure, you can try it","I wasn't so impressed with this album...there isn't enough ""groove"". I liked Endtroducing (as did every other reviewer here) but this one is kind of boring. Davis really showed off his ""edge"" on the first album....this one kind of misses the mark. I'll be returning mine as well."
3,disappointed...somewhat,"since Endtroducing ive been a huge Shadow fan. I bought this latest CD and i am kind of disappointed. There seems to be missing something, like the depth that shadows music usually has. there is not as much of the percussion, on previous cds Shadow usually has incredible drums, now his beats seem more ""electronic"" and rythyms seem less rich."
3,I GUESS I EXPECTED TOO MUCH?,"How do you follow an album like ""ENDTRODUCING"" w/o being critisized? I guess you can't. After a 6 year wait his new album just doesn't deliver to me. I liked it but (as hard as I tried not to) just expected way more. After one full listen the CD just didn't have any memorable tracks and none that I was twitching my fingers to replay. Good album but not a classic*"
1,Very Disapointing...,"I had never listened to DJ Shadow until now, and I wish I hadn't. The only thing abou this record that might have taken time to do was finding the samples the songs are made of. Being a musician myself, I have used samples, and I must say that putting a song together with samples is not challenging. If you want good electronic music that is made with original sounds check out Aphex Twin. i just don't see how someone can see talent in someone that is really doing nothing more than putting together a 1,000 peice puzzle. Children can do that. So enlighten yourselves if you don't believe."
1,sad and sick,"I bought this cd because I heard Blood on motorway, in a commercial. I thought it was a hot jig. Will, It wasnt like the commercial. I wasnt expecting Suicide lyrics and empty crys of the synthesizer. It was a waste of my 14.99 and Im resaling it."
4,DJ Who?,"No, I know who this guy is...thanks to some downloads.DJ Shadow is a very together young sir who knows what he wants to do...and then he does it.and if this thing he wants to do is make music, then he's done it.it's interesting how he can take a 1960's soul tune and change it juuuust enough to make it hip to listen to it again.recommended if you like multi-genre cds..."
2,In need of a DJ savior...,"After many years of anticpating the birth of another classic by DJ Shadow, I was left wondering. Make no mistake, DJ Shadow is my favorite DJ by far, but 'Private Press' just doesn't taste as good as 'Endtroducing'. It's kind of like a fat-free version of the real thing. Gone are the dark, ambient beats that make your mouth hang open. DJ Shadow may be branching out to other soundscapes; he's still clever, but on this disc, he is not the master of old."
3,Frustrating...,"I really do like this album. Not as much as Endtroducing, but I'd still give it 5 stars, save one detail. The nifty cardboard two-CD case it comes in has a major flaw. The glue inside the case is very sticky, and when I got the CD, both CDs were stuck inside the case. When I was able to get them out, they were both coated in goop, which I spent about 30 minutes scrubbing off in order to get them to play. Sad, that such a good album, and otherwise a good product, is brought down in quality so much by a design flaw like this."
3,Lost Abstract,I can appreciate the fact that Davis is moving in his own direction but this just didnt do it for me. His style took a complete turn from the trip-hop aspect and presents more conversation filled segments that are rather boring. There are a couple tracks that showcase Shadow's DJ talent and a few other alright tracks but if your looking for endtroduing or preemtive strike you wont find it here.
2,Poor relative to Entroducing,"I hoped after a few listens I would find the brilliance that was so evident on Entroducing. This album lacks focus. The battle dj business is trite. Gone is the dark theme that was so apparent on Entroducing where the entire album was one coherent piece of work. I wouldn't recommend it, in fact, I'm going to trade in my disc at the store in a few moments."
3,dissapointing...,"when i first heard entroducing, it blew my mind...probly the best record i have ever heard. it changed my whole musical perspective fer good. thats why i anticpated private press so much. however when i gave it my first lesson, it was...to say the least...DISAPOINTING! if you want a good record, get introducing. private press is rather dull, lacks a good flow, and only has a few good songs. its also a hell of a lot more techoish than entroducing was...not a good album.i sugest u burn it, not buy it."
3,Well it's interesting.,"You know, I bought this simply because it featured the Tube, and frankly I'm a Tube nut. (Don't run away!) In terms of the book, I was left wholly satisfied. The problem for me, as an adult, was this is a children's book. Nothing wrong with that either, as I like some children's books -- but they ought not seem like children's books (Harry Potter for instance).This one had such an obvious ""this is where the author is going"" predictability about it, it was irritating. Sure, there were some nice surprises showing how good a True Friend can be (kudos to the author) but they were outweighed by ""I know what's next."""
3,if only...,"I have a large chest. I dont know what I was thinking, but I thought this body wrap might work. Strapless bras tend to be painful. I was impressed at how it defied gravity; however, it ROLLS DOWN! Since I am not going to be in any Girls Gone Wild videos, this is not the bra for me. So, if you are a d cup or fuller, even the large might not be useful."
1,nasty,Used it several times and compared to the other brands iv used this tastes nasty in anything. Id never buy it again!
4,Good solid knife for the money,"Own one of these with black handle and one with green handle - and a mini with tanto blade.They're great knives.Very serviceable.You should know that you can get a little surface rust on the blade if you're not cautious. It's easy to remove.Black finish will wear off, but blade can be re-blackened using a gun-bluing pen if you worry about that kind of thing.Takes and keeps a good edge.Ambidextrous locking mechanism is excellent.Clip can be moved to either side of the handle supporting either right- or left-side carry.Be careful - you could cut yourself with these things!"
5,Great EDC,"I have this knife in all-black. It's been my EDC for at least two-years now and I love it. I'm a lefty and like carrying in my left back pocket, tip-down. Easy one-hand operation -opening and closing. Keeps an edge well. Black on blade eventually wears a bit. Top marks for a great knife."
5,Great knife!,"This is a wonderful carry around knife. Extremely well made. Sharp, versatile, tight fittings, but easily opened. You can tell by looking at it and how it handles that is a quality product. Would expect nothing less from Benchmade. This knife replaces a Benchmade that I lost last year. Glad to have it back."
3,Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren Sing,"The third CD of the Peter Sellers collection has songs sung in collaboration with the sultry siren herself, Sophia Loren. Some of the songs listed do not even have Peter singing (To keep my love alive). These songs are all comedies, and sometimes Sophia breaks out laughing, sounding playful, self conscious and flirtatious all at the same time.My parents had a vinyl album with those songs on it, and I listened and liked them from about age 12 on. I have not heard most of the songs on the other CDs, but if the quality is similar, these songs would be good to have if you are interested in comedic songs or celebrity singing. Peter Sellers has a good voice, but not a great one."
5,The Incomparable Horowitz,"The sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1757) are a treasure of variety and originality. Scarlatti wrote over 500 of them, and Horowitz plays a sample of them on this recording. With what sounds like effortless finger work, Horowitz plays these sonatas in myriad ways. Some forceful, some as delicate as fine lace, some slowly, some fast. A good program and representation of one of the most influential keyboard composers of history, and of Horowitz himself."
5,Stunning revelation,"Who knew the freshness that Horowitz brought to this canon? In one selection, he presages a connection to composers such as Glass and Adams. In another, the depth of feeling reaches out to the listener powerfully. This is a very enjoyable discovery for a non-expert."
5,Invaluable resource,"An invaluable resource for clergy,mental health professionals, EVERYONE! I will keep several copies on my nearest bookshelf so I can share it with congregants and friends. Ms. Kaplan deals with every conceivable tragedy/disappointment which life thrusts upon us, and helps us help others to cope in times of despair. What a sensitive and compassionate book!"
5,Thoughtful and thorough,Robbie Kaplan has given us the right words to say for just about every difficult situation imaginable. Her wise and compassionate advice will help anyone give comfort whenever and wherever needed.
5,Brilliant,Robbie Miller Kaplan writes kindly about her personal ordeal in a way that is useful and informative to those of us who have not faced tragedy up close and personal. The book allows you to gather words and be prepared to communicate at times when words mandate great finesse. In addition to words the book facilitates what etiquette to exercise in delicate situations ranging across a multiple spectrum of possibilities to include terrorism. I feel this book is a must have and a keeper for sure.
5,The Best,"What a book! I have used quite a few books about change, but this one is not ""about"" change, it is how to ""do"" change. The phases and the constituent roles under each are clear and very helpful. The tools are excellent, and the fact that I could use them off the CD-ROM saved me hours of time. I only wish that I would have had this book years ago. Anyone who is responsible for change is out of his or her mind for not following the wisdom found in this book."
5,Good stuff!,"I'm glad my 45lb cocker/standard poodle puppy loves the stuff because I trust the brand and its superior nutrition. Compare labels! My previous feed (Pedigree) was mostly corn. My little dude is healthy and happy and high energy and has a glossy coat. Also, superior nutrition produces smaller, compact stools."
4,Works great,This product works great if you use it right after your pet soils the carpet. Don't wait too long though. Smells great too!
2,Very Disappointed,"I am a fan of these type of books and always look for more as they can be very informative. So it is particularly disappointing to find two identical books given different covers and different titles. I had expected the author to have published a new book with new information. Instead this was identical to his ""Old-Time Farm and Garden Devices and How to Make Them"" published in 2005. The only change was the cover and title so I have two copies of the same book now."
5,Book is worth its weight in GOLD!,"I bought this book on 29-Feb-00 because I am inheriting a farm in West Virginia. I read through it last night and am 110% convinced that the ideas in this book will cut my workload in half and make my life better when I move to the farm. I have placed 27 yellow stickies in this book; one for each idea that I will be able to use in the coming year. If you own a farm, buy this book!"
1,Old Horseshoes,"This would be a useful book to anyone who has lots of old horseshoes, barrel hoops, wooden crates, sewing machine parts, plaster laths and other nineteenth century trash and discards.I don't find anything in it useful to modern organic gardeners or homesteaders. Don't waste your money."
3,Depends on what you're looking for...,"This was a nice, fun book to read... but it was essentially useless for actually helping you build any of the things it talks about (and gives interesting history and info about). So for a practical DIY book, it's useless, but for a book just to learn a bit about this stuff and it's history and get a frame of reference, it's not bad at all."
2,Extremely Vague,"I bought this book and had to return it. The table of contents makes it seem rather informative. However, the ""meat"" of the book is less than impressive. The font is huge. In other words, they don't accomplish much with the space used. The descriptions of how to make and use the devices are excessively vague and esoteric. Many words and carpentry terms are used that left me desiring a step-by-step diagram. No diagram available. There are only a few pictures and they are pastoral and sentimental rather than informative and instructional. I have no doubt that most of the devices I wouldn't be able to make correctly given the information in the book. Hence, I sent the book back. I would advise against buying this book for anyone who isn't already a carpenter or skilled farmer. Maybe my grandpa would have been able to use this book, but I could not."
3,a simple life,"Being a woman trying to do all of this alone would be rather overwhelming. However, If one can get some help and plan ahead, some of these things could be useful."
1,Horrible,"Not sure what edition I received, but my book didn't have pictures. There were sentences of gibberish on every page. The book lacked close to 150 pages the table of contents said it should have. I returned this book for a refund, and am incredibly dissapointed."
3,"Very Basic, but good ideas","So far i have only read about a 1/4 of the way through it, but as a machinist/welder by trade, i was expecting a little more detail on the plans and directions. i am not saying it is not a worthwhile book. With a little imagination and the basics that are stated throughout the book you can probably be inspired to make quite a few useful items. If you are looking for IDEAS to make your chores a bit easier then check it out. It is a good book as far as basics and LOTS of ideas."
2,"Archaic, I would not recommend.","If by ""how to make them"" you were thinking of a blueprint or plan, forget it. You will have to intuit construction from a sketch. Many of the projects/ideas were applicable in days gone by, but worth a read now only for the charm."
2,No pictures!,"I'm sure the original is a great book - but this version has no pictures, so when the text refers you to look at the drawing, you have nothing to reference. I'm looking for a copy with original illustrations."
3,Multiple formatting errors,"This does appear to be the unabridged Seidensticker translation, and it's great to finally have a full Genji for the kindle. But the conversion to Kindle format seems to be flawed. The formatting metadata (chapter titles, notes etc) appear as part of the text. For example, <K 1>[Japanese Volume]<C 1>[The Pawlonia Court], etc. This ebook needs to be withdrawn and reformatted."
3,"""Twilight"" of the Heian period","Genji is an over-romanticized pretty boy and playboy type dreamed up by a lady of the Heian court. His ""adventures"" are mostly conquests of different women. The story comes off as wish-fulfillment of bored, under romanced women. Now, historically, this novel is incredibly relevant. The Heian period was the emergence of Japanese civilization as we know it, and the book has great first-hand descriptions of the clothings, customs, and lives of the people of this period. Also, the Chinese influence that largely helped shape the Heian period is given multiple nods in this book in the form of quotations of Chinese poetry, and references to Chinese history."
3,Do not purchase Einstein Books Kindle version,"This is a wonderful book, but the Einstein Books version for Kindle is simply terrible. In some areas, it is indescipherable due to missing words and/or phrases.Should be pulled from the e.shelves..."
1,Glorified Incest,"This book disgusted me. I have never read anything so incestuous. 'Tale of Genji' is an overindulgent, horrific story. Any man who covets a girl of approxiamately age seven for a wife is what I would call a 'pedophile' not a prince. Not to mention that he impregnates his step mother. I have to wonder about those who gave this book 5 stars. Spare yourself the disgust, and use your money more wisely."
4,"A funky Prince album, with no Prince and a too much talk.","Do you like Prince and the Mineapolis sound? Then you'll like this one. It's a fullhearted, funny, funky Prince album, except Prince is appearing incognito and is only to be sensed. But not to worry, the NPG does a great job. For instance a song like ""Hallucination Rain"" is unforgettable with its woodstock-hippie-like guitar solo. There are a lot of high quality songs. There's only one major drawback- all the talk. It seems like the guys have had a lot of fun making the album, but the jokes and gags aren't as funny the third time you play the record."
4,Counting Fun Seems to Work...,"We rented this from Netflix first and it's a current favorite. Both my 2 year old and my 3.5 year old like it and the 3 year old has learned to count from it, to 10 easily and is working on up to 20 pretty well so far. I like several of the songs (and as a musician I'm picky) and the Sesame Street characters are generally appealing (although I can live without Elmo doing Rap). A bonus was that I remember the ""number nine martian cutie"" song from my youth! :-)"
3,Sesame Street - 123 Count With Me,"This dvd does not keep my son's attention as well as other dvds out there (Baby Einstein, Richard Scary), but he does love the musical numbers & will dance with them. Obviously, the educational value is high, but I would have expected better from Sesame Street."
1,Sesame Street: 123 Count with me,This tape doesn't play properly It skips a lot. My son got excited at the beginning and then it just started skipping.
3,3 1/2 stars....,I've been disappointed with this video. The bunny is a bit over the top for me and I don't think this video's story line flows as well. I'm sure their are MUCH better counting videos out there...
3,It is ok,It is ok dvd. But the style is bit old. I think the numbers are flashing too fast. If children watch for long time I guess it would not be so good for their eyes.
3,Who's that Ernie?,"Yep, despite that voice change, this is a truly engaging disc. Sesame Street is still as entertaining to me as an adult as it was when I was a kid, and my kid is now enjoying this too.But I must take a minute and criticize the sound quality of this disc (and 'Do The Alphabet' as well). In normal operation, I will run my TV volume at 19, 26 for VHS, 23 for DVD. This DVD requires the volume turned up to an unbelievable 37 before it's decently audible. But when I pop in the 'Kids Favorite Songs 1' DVD, I have to turn the volume DOWN to 14. What is up with this, Sony Wonder?"
3,2 year old in the house ...,"I bought this video at the same time as I bought ""Do the Alphabet"" and now my two-year old nephew won't watch it. He only asks for ""Bic Birt"" (Big Bird is on the box of ""Alphabet""). I've tried sneaking it into the VCR when he isn't watching in hopes he'll get hooked, but he always asks plaintively for the other one. Personally, I think that they count a little fast for him while the ""Alphabet"" tape goes pretty slow. And Baby Bear is always a winner. I think though that he will appreciate when he gets a little older."
4,Very convenient for kids,"If you have kids, definitely this is the right choice for their TV time. Educative, fun, and long enough for their needs."
5,Great video,My 1 year old can count to 14! The songs are funny and the both my kids love to watch it.
4,Sesame Street-123 Count With Me,"This DVD is good as far as exposing children to numbers and my 2 year old seemed to enjoy it, but the bunny is VERY rude. My son has not asked to watch it so I haven't shown it to him since the first viewing, because if the rudeness of the bunny. I would prefer if they made an effort to display or encourage good manners as well as teach about academic things, like Barney tends to do."
2,Really bad...,"I rarely review books or DVDs but I felt compelled to do so with this one because it is really, really bad. There's a lot of yelling from one of the main characters (the bunny) and, though the songs are cute, there's no way to play all of the songs without also watching some of the bunny, who comes across as really cantankerous and angry. I love Sesame Street as a general rule, but strongly dislike this particular video."
2,Not what you think,"The story line is very boring. My toddler loses interest immediately. As a parent, I do as well. Compared to some of the other Sesame dvd's, this one is poor. Story line is portrayed by Ernie, along with ""second string"" characters. I think you should spend your money on other learning materials."
2,I miss the *real* Ernie...,"Is anyone else annoyed by the ""new"" voice of Ernie? I find the character has lost that spark of mischievousness that made Ernie so wonderful. Maybe I'm just getting old...Otherwise, I agree that Benny is obnoxious and out of place, and some of the songs are so banal it makes my skin crawl (that ""Rock around the Clock"" thing is God-awful).On the plus side, at least it doesn't center around Elmo (people complain that Baby Bear's speech is a bad influence, I can't even understand Elmo half the time, and I sure wish he (she?) would stop referring to itself in the 3rd person...).Just grouchy tonight, but I'm not fond of this one."
1,It is not working for me in my kids portable DVD player,I bought this product with great hope. But it is not working in my kids portable DVD player. But I didnt get time to return it.
4,Educational and fun,"This works well as a teaching aid if you are wanting to teach your child/children how to count. I like the fact that my daughter learns a lot quicker and easier instead of just having me sit there and go over the numbers and it can get boring. It provides some songs and dances here and there and my kid seems to enjoy watching it. I recommend this to families that are looking to teach their kids, and just want a little extra to help them along."
3,just OK,"my 2 year old won't watch this video. i bought it about 6 months ago, and she watched it maybe a half a dozen times then, but if i suggest it now I get an emphatic NO. she loves counting books and activities, so my guess is the Furry Arms, the monster couple that run it, and benny the bunny just don't resonate with her, because she typically loves ernie. I wish i'd gotten the count's counting DVD instead."
3,not her favorite,"My daughter is 19 months old and loves Sesame Street. But we were disappointed that she didn't like this DVD. She found the rabbit/bellhop character annoying and a little scary. He's kind of ugly and mean, and unfortunately he's the main character after Ernie. And her favorite character, Elmo, is only in one vignette. It was also too slow to hold her attention without more of her favorites like Elmo or Cookie Monster in it. She's learning to count just great without it anyway, so we'll probably just give it to someone else."
3,Just Okay,This video was just okay in my opinion. My son did learn his numbers from watching it but I found it annoying. I liked Sesame Streets The Great Numbers Game much much better.
5,A 17 month old's favorite,"My 17 month old loves this video....we watch it about 3-4 times a week and after just a few weeks he is already pointing out 2's and 9's. If that's not amazing enough, every once in a while he'll point to a 5 or a 7 and be right! (ok sometimes it's another number but it still amazes me!).The songs are catchy and the action fast (he gets bored with some of the slower/calmer story lines). It's a good mix of songs and muppets and counting series.It's a good early video to introduce Sesame Street. You won't be sorry...."
4,great video,"My 18 month old has been enjoying this video for months. It has some old favorites (""#9 cutie"", ""One singular sensation"") and some new catchy tunes (""1 and 2 and 3"" sung by three counting crows, ""Seven"" sung by Dorothy andher goldfish friends & ""Five"" rapped by M.C. Elmo)as well. They count all the way up to 15 and there is almost a song for every number."
3,Not very interesting and no Elmo!,This DVD was very advanced for my 18-month old. In Kids favorite Songs there is a lot of counting backwards from 10 to 1 which my kid loves too mimick (he still doesn't say much that can be understood) so I thought he would love this DVD. There is too much talking in the intro and it bores my kid as soon as it starts plus there is no Elmo. My kid loves Elmo and expects to see Elmo on Sesame Street. We are keeping this DVD for later when he is about 3 he might appreciate it then. Right now he has no interest in it whatsoever.
2,Benny the Bunny....,"I like the video and I think that the songs are great, however Benny the Bunny is very annoying and I find his yelling absolutely inappropriate for young children. Does every video these days have to have an obnoxious character? This is the kind of thing that desensitizes children. It really is a shame because otherwise this video has some great songs. My favorite video is Sesame Street's 25th Birthday - A Musical Celebration (1993). It has great songs and is mellow."
3,good but not great video,"This video has some very cute counting songs - I'm a fan of ""One Singular Sensation"" and a real oldie but goodie, ""Number 9 Cutie"" - but I find the cranky bunny tedious and I wish he didn't yell ""duh"" at the other characters. In the beginning it's a little slow between songs but by the end the pace is good. I find it very annoying that Sesame Street puts advertising for its other videos at the start of the video - hard for kids to wait for you to fast-forward through."
5,Great DVD,"My 1.5 yr old loves this and she can actually count now! Filled with songs and old standbys, you cant go too wrong with this one. For maximum ""babysitting time"", try 25th anniversary DVD - it is an hour long! this one is half that."
5,Exact replacement,"This is the exact replacement for the Ninja 250 Pregen. I bought it along with a new chain and front sprocket, however, I believe that it was really unnecessary. The front sprocket was really worn bad, but the rear didn't have hardly any wear. I would recommend changing the rear sprocket only every other chain. The front sprocket should be changed with every new chain."
4,Great Books for a new generation!,"I fell in love with Dragonlance years ago with the original Chronicles trilogy, of Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Winter Night, and Spring Dawning. I recently purchased the first of Kid friendly books for my younger brother. They were edited with the more adult themes taken out and had a few new works of art. But the problem is that they are the same price as the one original. So you are paying the full price of the full book for half the book. Even though this makes no sense I am glad that a new Genereation of young Adventurers will be able to travel Krynn!All in all a great book that might not be as hard as a full novel for children to read, but if you are older just buy the originals. Thanx!"
5,The Bassoonist's Indispensible Friend,"Not only are Oral-B Humming Bird Dental Picks the choice of dentists from Albert Lea, Minnesota, to Zongo, Zaire, but once used upon your remaining teeth they become the perfect implement for cleaning the scuzz out of your bassoon reeds and cornetto mouthpiece. I'm reasonably sure that anyone can master their primary use in a few easy practices. In fact, I'd guess that if a pack were left open on the outskirts of Zongo, the first chimpanzee that happened upon them would perceive their utility for picking bush-baby hairs out of his/her teeth."
1,Item never shipped by seller and I was never refunded my money,Contacted seller regarding refund and telling them that I hadn't received the item. I also filed a claim when I didn't get a response from the seller.I have yet to have this problem rectified.
1,Only floss now,Didn't receive the toothpick style..just the floss type. Went to the oral-b web site hoping to find it there and they don't sell the toothpick type. No explanation given. So no one should advertise it as that style is obsolete since I believe only the floss style is now available.
2,Order not filled correctly,"The product is what I wanted. Bu I ordered multiple packs, but received only one. Thus the shipping cost was excessive for what I got."
4,Finally a decent live ELO album,"There are live albums of the original lineup out there, but without exception, the sound on all of them is absolutely cruddy. Well, I never had a bootleg mentality (paying more than a decent album wiould cost just to own the thing), so I never touched the things. Okay, so these guys in this one aren't all the same guys. Big deal. Not only do they present the newer material well like you'd expect, they even do a decent job on the oldies (I mean, some of these guys were little kids when that stuff was first released). And this being the decade it is, the sound is good. So, not only is this a worthwhile album for the new fan, it has something for us dinosaurs who followed the old lineup, too! Don't forget, ""our"" ELO never did get around to a decent live album."
5,A good buy,This is a good buy for this price. It's easy to clean and you can bring it out of the oven straight to the table. It has a heavy sturdy feel to it that I really like.
2,Cheesy 80's bad.,"Wow, where to start. If you are looking for a solid documentary this isn't your video. If you are looking for some 80's nostalgia then this is definitely all you! Some of the kooky people giving interviews are hysterical."
4,Perfect for the money!,"This chair is perfect for a relaxing massage. The massage is deep & effective. I was happily surprised as to its quality & attractiveness.I would wholeheartedly give this chair 5 stars where it not for two small complaints:1) It does not quite get to lower (20%) of my back.2) You can't realy sit on this chair without a massage, because the rolling balls that give you the massage park themselves on top of the chair just below the neck area."
3,Not as soft as I had hoped.,I washed them before using them the first time with fabric softener and they are still not soft. I'm hoping that with continued washing they may get softer. I don't feel like dealing with sending them back.
2,Not impressed second time,"I ordered these sheets last April, and received a very nice, soft set of sheets, that were thicker than expected. I ordered a set this month (different size and color) and received a not-so-soft, thinner sheet set. I am not really happy with this second set. If I had handled them in a store, I would not have purchased them. Poor quality control? Or just a different manufacturer for different sizes? Good luck! The only positive is that this is the best fitting set I've found for a thick king-sized bed...and yeah, they're stitched together properly."
2,Renaisance 600 sheets,"We recently bought the 600 thread count sheets. I wasn't crazy about the color, but figured they would at least feel good. They were great until we washed them. Then they pilled up. I was suprised at how worn they look after just one washing. I'm glad that we only bought one set of sheets."
3,Love the color but have started to pill.,I bought these sheets in the green color. It is the most beautiful green that I have ever seen. I have had them for about 6 months now. At the beginning they were a bit stiff. My bed is a queen and I ordered a queen but they are still a little too large. They just tend to wrinkle under you when you sleep. My main complaint is that they have started to pill. This is so distressing because they are so beautiful and so soft other than the pilling. Overall they are not worth the price. If they had not started to pill I would have been extremely happy with my purchase.
1,"Nice at first, pilled quickly","First of all I was surprised at the bright gold color which looks nothing like the cafe I ordered. I liked the feel of the sheets at first but I couldn't believe how it pilled up after the first washing, and more so with each washing. I don't even use a dryer - I line dry them. Really disappointed and looking for sheets that stay soft."
1,"Buyer Beware - these are a scratchy, wrinkly mess","After reading many reviews I ordered these. Boy was that a big mistake and a waste of money. I keep hoping given the high thread count that washing will help. No such luck - they come out of the dryer a scratchy, wrinkly mess - and I'm talking hard crease wrinkles. In a desperate attempt to salvage these i resorted to ironing hoping the threads would lie down - my heavy duty steam iron could barely get the wrinkles out of the pillowcases. Now i'm stuck with them ... i'm going to continue to keep washing with fabric softener hoping for a miracle but my guts telling me these high priced sheets will wind up in the Goodwill bag. Unless u like scratchy burlap, don't buy these sheets. They do NOT live up to the advertising. Whether it matter or not I ordered the brown king size set. A friend has recommended bamboo sheets - i'm going to try that next. OBVIOUSLY high thread count does NOT guarantee softness or quality."
1,worst sheets ever,"Has to wash them twice before use and they turned into a cheap wrinkly cotton mess. Absolutely worse ""sateen"" sheets ever!"
1,"Renaissance 600 thread queen sheets from Amazon ""HOTEL brand queen bedding""","I ordered the Renaissance 600 thread count queen sheet set for $59.99; what a RIP-OFF! The sheets are definitely NOT luxury as described. They are NOT ""heavy, thick"" 600 thread sheets, they are NOT normal queen size (only double bed size), and the pillow cases are TOO SMALL for regular pillows! I am extremely disappointed as I have bought heavier, more luxurious Egyptian sheets from both Costco and Sam's for about half the price. DO NOT waste your money on these."
2,SHEETS ARE NOT SOFT NOR FEEL LIKE SATEEN,If your looking for Sateen or Soft then these sheets aren't for you!.. The sheets felt good in package but once you wash they do not feel like Sateen or a high thread count! Remember you can't return once washed! I ordered based on high feedback from others-so disappointed!!
1,They wrinkle!,Not happy with these sheets. I have to iron them and they do not feel like they are 600 count. Will not purchase this brand again.
2,Pretty sheets that are not quality,The 600 count sheets are nice at first. I have had mine for a little over 2 months. After washing a few times thefabric has balled up like a fleece item after much use. After reading the 30 day return policy from Amazon Iwas most disappointed. Most items stay neat and undamaged the first few months of using. I wish I had bought sheetslocally so I could return or exchange them for a higher quality.
2,400 TC Egyptian Cotton seems more comfortable.,"Regardless of other issues, these sheets aren't the smooth out of the box (nor after a good washing or two) that one finds in 400 threadcount Egyptian Cotton sheets. I'll be returning these and buying 400 TC Egyptian cotton."
2,Nothing Special,"Sheets are stiff upon arrival and do not *approach* comfort until the 3rd or 4th wash. I am not sure their idea of ""sateen"" is the same as the rest of the industry. Apparently they have ""sateen"" confused with ""sail canvas"".A few months later I bought these http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ICYV04/ref=ox_ya_oh_productfor [...] more and they are SO much nicer. I wish I'd just bought them in the first place."
2,Bad Sheets,"The material in these sheets is harsh-feeling, and keeps in a great deal of heat. We were waking up and throwing off the sheets in the middle of the night, even with a ceiling fan going in an air conditioned room. We expected 600 count sheet to be soft and supple, but these felt very rough and scratchy. Also, the color, Cafe, is really a gold, and was not what was expected."
4,Very Comfortable Sheets,I have purchased sheets from various stores in the past. Mostly linen stores or dept stores. Took a chance not being able to check these out by feeling the quality before buying. The proof is in the use. Very good quality. Better that I expected.
1,Bad sheets,"these sheets were used three times and are badly pilled. I never wash towels with my sheets so it is just bad fiber even though they were supposed to be 600 thread count. Tried to return them, missed the return date. I would have to have left them on the bed for the whole month to know they were this bad."
2,Not worth it.,I haven't gotten more than 3 uses out of this set and consider them scrap material at this point. They seem to shrink more with each wash. They never fit my standard sized king well and now dont fit at all. They piled up immediately and quite a bit with each wash so not a smooth feeling on your skin at all. Others wrote about wrinkling which I also experienced though that doesn't bother me much. With all the good reviews I honestly wonder if different sheets are being sold as the same product.
3,Color misleading,"Picture does not reflect the true color. Cafe is not a tan color, it is golden bronze. Lots of lint when washed. Sheets are soft & comfortable. Overall, very disappointed."
5,great sheets,I love my sheets. They are soft and durable. I love the color. IT matches perfectly with my comforter that I bought. No complaints here!
3,600-Thread-Count Cotton Sateen California King Sheet Set,"This is basically an excellent product. The 600 thread count sheet set is soft, supple, and sturdy with very well sewn seams and corners. The only problem I have with the set is that the size of the fitted bottom sheet is slightly small, making it difficult to stretch over the 15"" thick Cal King mattress. (This was ""out of the box"" small, before washing it). All of the previous sheets I have purchased for my Cal King bed have been well-sized, with no skimping on fabric. Other than that, it's a great buy."
4,Rough but als well woven,"At 600 count I expected soft, smooth sheets. But as I have found out, thread count alone is not a good indicator.HOWEVER, I gave it 4 stars because, while these sheets are a little rough, they are very durable. So many of the softer sheets fall apart after a few washings. Well these are strong.I would have rather them be strong AND soft but they are still a good price as long as you realize that they feel like 200 count rather than 600.For the price and the durability, they get 4 stars."
4,Color different than picture,I like these sheets but the Cafe set has a much more gold tone than the picture shows. Very disappointed in that aspect but the quality is pretty nice.
3,OK but scratchy and loud,Have you ever had a noisy pair set of sheets? Buy these and you will. They are scratchy and not the quality I expected. They aren't what I would consider junk but they aren't decent quality either.
2,Wrong color came in!,"I should've read the reviews more carefully. I ordered WHITE. The color that came in was CREAM. They call it ""Ivory""... That's like an off-white yellowish color. Other reviewers have stated the same thing about the wrong color coming in.I'm too lazy to return this. There are also no 5-star rated white queen size sheets (under $100) at all on Amazon.com Next time, I'll have to access an old fashioned department store of some type to get the proper sheets. No more ordering sheets online."
3,Sized Small,"The material in the product was good to excellent, however the sizing was skimpy. It is very difficult to put the fitted sheet on the mattress due to its size and the top sheet is sparse on the sides of the bed."
5,soft and luxurious,"I had no idea that these sheets would feel so great. They have a smooth, silky feel to them. I just love them and definitely recommend them. Whoever thought that sheets could be so luxurious."
1,Not happy,I had ordered 2 sets of these sheets and as usual the shipping was excellant. But the sheets themselves were very diappointing. They were fine until they were washed. They no longer fit the air mattress at all. And I feel they were a total waste of money. I recommand that you save your money and purchase something else.
1,"When did ""Ivory"" turn ""Yellow""?","I ordered really nice sheets, and thought that the color ""ivory"" would look nice. It certainly looks nice and white on the web page! When it arrived the contents were marked ""Ivory"", but the actual color is yellow (a very uncomplimentary color for sheets). When I compare the color of what I got with the web site, there's a stark contrast. It's a case of color misrepresentation in the advertising. There's no obvious way to deal with this without losing shipping costs, etc. Very disappointing!"
1,Returned.,"I ordered these needing some 'Cafe' colored sheets...When you see Cafe, you think of a light brown. These sheets are GOLD. Definitely returning them. Very disappointed."
5,Can't ask for more,"Soft, comfortable, and fits over my 13"" profile mattress just fine. I agree with the recommendations elsewhere here: wash in cold water to keep soft, and dry on med to low heat. For the price, this is the best deal for sheets on Amazon!"
1,Horrible. More like 250 Thread Count,"I purchased these sheets because we like a high thread count, soft sheet and this seemed like a good deal. Instead, we received sheets that are akin to what you would find in a cheap motel room. These sheets are nothing close to other 600 TC sheets I own. They are stiff and irritating, even after 2 washings with fabric softener. They feel nothing like ""Sateen"" as advertised. I have a set of 400 TC sheets that are far superior in softness than these sheets. In short, save your money unless you intend to put these in a cheap motel room."
2,Problems after washing,"I purchased a set of Renaissance 600-count sheets at a store and loved it - silky and a good fit. I sought and found what looked like the same sheets on Amazon (same name, thread count,appearance and price). I purchase the ivory and teal blue. I did not receive the blue sheets, but a more blue-gray. Amazon offered to take them back and ultimately I got them without charge. Both colors shrank a bit when washed, enough to make it a struggle to get them on the bed. But after washing the ivory also became thicker, annoyingly so. Ultimately I gave them away."
1,I Should Read Reviews,"I'd been looking for some chocolate colored sheets to complement our new master bedroom. Saw the Renaissance Collection 600 thread count and said ""wow, nice..."" WRONG!!! I washed them before I put them on the bed as I always do with new linen and what came out of the dryer were EXTREMELY wrinkled sheets ... they felt soft when I took them out of the packaging but they lost all their softness once I washed them ... I know there is a lesson to be learned ..."
5,Sheets,Awesome deal . Great Sheets . Was abit dissapointed in that I had to wait over a month for shipment though.
3,Sheet Set,"I like the thread, the material is soft but the size do not feet at all. Queen size result real big for our child bed and King do not fit too to our bed was bigger too, even thought material is great and color too, is a good sale for price!"
3,Sheets are just okay,"For the price paid, which could have been a good deal, these sheets were just okay. They were not as soft as I would have expected for a 600-thread count. Also, the color was more of a mustard yellow than gold, but this was okay by me. The trim stitching at the top of the flat sheet and pillow cases is nothing more than a simple zig-zag stitching and I can see where it can easily begin to fray early in the lifecycle of these sheets."
2,"Nice sheets, wrong color.","The sheets are seemingly good quality and feel nice and soft, but the color they say you are purchasing is not accurate.We bought the king size set in the ""cafe"" color, but the sheets we received are literally gold in color.The packaging on them does say ""cafe"".....So how hard is it to put the color that the consider ""cafe"" on the web page so you can see it properly?Either they post incorrect pictures or the manufacturing process is so poor that they dye them incorrectly.Either way, I'd probably pass. We're going to keep them and make them work in a pinch, otherwise we'd be sending back since they don't match up with the other bed pieces we purchased...."
3,Sheets aren't Teal colored,I ordered these sheets because they were pictured as being teal/aqua. The teal sheets are more of a gray blue instead of a green blue. Nice sheets but they aren't the color I expected.
3,Color not accurate,"The sheets are really good quality, but the color is way off the mark and certainly the color on the web. I ordered the teal and received a grayish color, definitely NOT what the customer ordered and dumb me, I ordered two sets. It's too much trouble returning from an APO."
3,"Good value, odd color","The Cafe' color is gold alright. It is an ever-so-slightly greenish gold. If you love the '70s color schemes you might like it. Around here, we call it, ""baby diarrhea."" I don't really care too much about sheets except that they are quality fabric, soft, thick, and fit the mattress well. These do that, but the color is not my cup of tea, so to speak. On the other hand, in the dark, they feel great.David"
4,the color is different from the picture,"The color is far away diffrent than it showend on the picture. Much more yellow and bright than it showned on the picture. Quality is good, soft enough, looks like silk. I would give 5 stars if the color is right."
4,very soft and shiny,"Item was delivered very fast. Arrived as pictured, but thought color would be a little different (more mustard color than tan). Very soft and shiny sheets. Won't have to worry about ""breaking"" them in to make them soft."
5,Great sheets for the money,"I am a sheet person and I have had many sets over 500 thread count. I've paid over $100 in most cases. These are great quality for a great price! They are thick yet soft. I love them and would highly recommend them. They are a bit wrinkly coming out of the dryer, but I have not found sheets yet (that weren't silk) that come out perfect. If you take them right out and smooth them out on the bed, they are beautiful."
2,"They look great, but didn't last long","Nice comfortable beautiful looking sheets. However, the colors faded within a few months, and the threads etc started looking freyed in a similiar time-frame. I don't have much to compare to as far as other products, but I have to say I was disappointed."
3,Heavy Duty Sheets,"I bought this sheet set because of previous reviews and price; after using them I want to share a few thoughts. They seem to be well made and they are made of very thick/heavy cotton material as previously reviewed. That can be either a good thing or bad. In a cool temperature bedroom they help keep you warm but in a warm bedroom they are way too hot. My biggest complaint is that after cold water washing, low drying and prompt drier removal as recommended they come out super wrinkled. I've not seen other sheets wrinkle this bad, maybe because of their thickness. I would not buy again."
2,Disappointed & Unworthy !!!,"I was disappointed when I got them. They weren't as great as the price cost ! Unworthy that I ever had. They just OK, not soft also got shrink after laundry even I did what the instruction said."
5,Renaissance 600 thread count sheet set,Love the sheets. Excellent quality at 600 thread count at a wonderful price!!
3,"Soft and smooth, lots of wrinkles.","I like these sheets in the summer..cool , soft and smooth.I bought the queen size in green color.After some washes I realize that the color has faded a little.I can't tell if the other colors fade..but the green has.Lots of wrinkles..still they are soft and feel good : )"
2,"Odd color, short pillow cases.","I like the fabric of the sheets, but I ordered the color ""Cafe"" and it looks like it should be called ""Harvest Gold"" It doesn't match the comforter I bought like I had hoped. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030HEFXI/ref=oss_product) Many other people bought these sheets with the comforter I had also purchased, in fact that is why I decided on these sheets, I am a guy and I'm just not very good at color coordinating. Also, the pillow cases are too short! I ordered a California King sheet set, and my king sized pillows hang out of the cases about 2 or 3 inches, it looks tacky!I'm not happy with these, I'm not going to return them because it's too much of a hassle for me, but I would not recommend it to friends, and would not purchase again :("
4,Pleasantly Surprised but yet Disappointed...,"The sheets are nice and I truly love the fee l, I am surprised by the quality especially since they were such a great deal; however I am disappointed in the color, its completely off. I ordered the color Cafe to match a comforter set I just purchased. Judging from the picture (as well as my own expectations) I presumed the color would be a Mocha-ish/Coffee color as opposed to the bright marigold color it resembles. Other than that, the sheet set is an excellent purchase and you wont be disappointed. Just consider and think twice about the color you choose to order."
3,Just OK,I love the honey (gold) color but not real happy to find a PRE-STAINED pillow case It looks like the dye was dragged across the pillow case. It wasn't major so I didn't notice it till after the wash. That side of the pillow faces the wall. I recommend a thorough check before wash and or use to be able to return if needed.
2,Meh,"These are about as soft as my 300 thread count sheets that I've had for five years and of lesser quality than my 500 thread count sheets. Had I known that they'd be of less than mediocre quality, I may have sprung for something more expensive with a higher thread count as I was looking to upgrade. However, I fell victim to the relatively attractive price and, due to that price, it's simply not worth the shipping cost and hassle to return them so as far as I'm concerned I'm stuck with them.If you're used to thread count sheets around 600 I'd suggest not purchasing them because you'll almost assuredly be as unimpressed with them as I am."
1,I want my money back,Still after several washes and softner they are rough. I ended up buying 600 count from Costco and they are wonderful. I was very disspointed. No way thse are 600 thread count.
5,"Excellent sheets, great value for the money.","Excellent sheets, great value for the money. Very thick and comfortable. Soft after a wash or two. Buy them! You wont regret the 40$ for Cafe King set. I am getting a second set."
4,Good Quality for Price,"I have tempur-pedic oversized mattress that I have terrible time finding sheets for. These sheets are soft, fit well and don't shrink after washing. Luxurious and a good value."
3,Tight and Poor Fit,"Decent quality, though I was looking for a sateen sheet set that was comparable to my Hilfiger set - but this only feels 1/2 as good to the touch.The size of the fitted sheet pockets are not ample enough to fit my Cal King with pillow top on all four corners. Three corners are good, but it comes up short when I get to the final corner.Pillow cases are good though for King pillows, but again don't expect it to feel like an RL or Hilfiger set.So you do get what you pay for, no great deals here. I purchased two of these after reading all the glowing reviews, but I would not recommend comparing them to the Sateen sheets from the aforementioned name brands."
1,2009 purchase repurchase in 2012,"I just went back and searched my purchase from 2009 so I could by the same set as before. Mine finally had a worn spot that split.I love these sheets they are thick and cool, don't cling. The fitted sheet stays put and that's saying a lot because I don't like to stay still when I sleep.I have only one other set that I hate so these are a wash weekly and put back on set and have really held up amazingly. After I receive my new set I will update and determine if the quality is the same etc. but as of now 5 stars.Unfortunately the new set were a disappointment, much thinner that before and started pilling after the first couple of washes. first time I have returned an item like this."
4,Looks Really Great,"Really like these sheets. Have a definite nice 'satin' shine to them, feel really comfortable and definitely have deep pockets for your mattress.I use a memory foam mattress topper and those had no problem fitting over the topper plus mattress. Seem to wrinkle very easily, however, and I'll be interested to see how long they last with a few washes... Remains to be seen."
5,These are the best sheets ever...,"I have bought already 4 of them over the last two years, the quality is amazing, they are soft to the touch, you can feel the silk and cotton on a perfect mix.Ill keep buying them. The last I bought was the teal one. Soooo awesome. Im very pleased with these sheets."
2,Not what was expected!,"Sorry, but at 600 thread count, I was expecting a soft sheet, something that kinda felt like satin. Boy was I wrong! They washed up nicely, but the softness I expected wasn't there. Felt more like a cheap sheet I'd buy from a discount store!!I'd send them back, but it's more of a hassel then I want to deal with at this time.Sondra"
1,Disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed in these sheets. I would like to return them, but I used them. However, the sheets are not sateen in my estimation. They are coarse to lay on and I would expect much better from Amazon."
1,Very Poor Quality,"These sheets were an utter disappointment, there is no way that they are 600 thread count - they are coarse and cheap feeling. The sheets I normally buy at Costco are much nicer quality at a similar price.I would not recommend that anyone buy these scratchy sheets. The only reason I didn't return them was because I threw away the box when I washed the sheets, hoping that they would soften up during washing - they did not.Terrible sheets."
1,stiffer than uncooked pasta,better used as an all-night long exfoliant. i used the pillow case to rub out a scratch on my wooden bookshelves. the color is closer to gold than cafe.
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting some decent quality out of this sheet set: softness, shine and comfort sleeping. I have another set of sheets from Bed Bath & Beyond, and I'll just say that it's better to spend some extra money and have better value!Definitely disappointed on the quality of this set, maybe some people might be happy enough with it, but I know that you can get something way better for extra $40!"
4,Thick deep colored sheets,"Great sheets. They wash well however, I would have given them 5-stars if the sheets were just a little softer...maybe after a few more washings."
1,Sleeping on canvas,"I have been told that the higher the thread count, the softer the sheet. Not in this case. The sheets (after a couple of washings) are still stiff and rough. I actually got up and put my old 300-400 sheets from a discount store on the bed in the middle of the night because I could not sleep on these. I thought I was ""treating"" myself with these--unfortunately it turned out to be torture."
3,Lost Their Sheen,"I was extremely pleased when I got these sheets though they do seem a little big for my queen size pillowtop. I thought they would shrink a little because of all the other reviews I've read, but mine haven't. I don't think the wrinkling would be nearly as noticeable if it were a tighter fit on the mattress.They are comfy to sleep on, no problems.My biggest problem is that after the first washing, on lukewarm water with mild soap the top & bottom sheets have lost most of their sateen sheen. They just look like slightly dull cotton. The cafe color is lovely, very golden and less coffee. And while I'm somewhat dissapointed these are still a great buy when you think that 250 thread count sheets at Walmart are gonna cost you $40!"
2,Stiff & Noisy,"I should have listened to what I read in previous veviews. I've washed these sheets 3 times in 2 days TRYING to get these soft and not noisy & stiff. Practically dumped fabric softener in the washer and added 2-3 fabric softener sheets in the dryer all 3 times. What the heck are they made of? I really expected softer sheets for 600 TC. Sure, they fit good, but are wrinkly and stiff to say the least. Wish I had better news."
2,Just OK,"This sheets are just ok, they match the comforter set I purchased. They do not wash up well, they are very wrinkled even when removing from dryer immediately."
4,"Comfortable, thick, exactly as advertised.","Good quality sheets! The fitted sheet, if put on the bed straight out of the dryer, doesn't require ironing, but the topsheet & pillowcases do. This isn't unexpected with a thread count this high. They're comfortable, the color is sharp and uniform, and I sleep well on them. Definitely above average."
4,i love these,I have bought these sheets in almost all the colors they sell.I love them. I think they are a very good price. In a retailstore you would pay more than $39.00 for a set.Some of the reviewers say that they must be ironed. I havenot ironed bedding since I was in high school. My mom usedto have me iron sheets and pillow cases every Sunday afternoon.Once I left home I never ironed them again. I don't think thesesheets need ironing.The higher the thread count the stiffer they will be. They are notun-comfortable to sleep on. They fit my pillow top king bed nicely.I always wash in cold water and they have not faded. Dry on lowheat.I have bought my daughter in law several sets also. She is veryhappy with them. She has the queen size.Sheets had gotten so expensive that I was down to 2 sets. One onthe bed and 1 in the washer. I love having several sets.I would not pay MORE than $39.00.
5,Nice,The sheet set was exactly what I was looking for. They are very smooth and the color description was perfect. I highly recommend this product.
3,"Not the best, but good for the price.","Color is darker in person than appears in the photo (think dark chocolate, not milk chocolate). Sheets are very stiff upon receiving. I have washed a couple of times, and still are a bit stiff. I imagine they will soften up in time. Good for the price, but not the best."
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"The color was a bit different than I was expecting -- more gold than ""latte"". Have washed several times but still not soft enough. Appears to be good quality."
3,They are ok,"My husband LOVES these sheets, I think they are ok. I expected more from a 600 thread count sheet. I think they are a teensy bit prickly but my husband thinks they are wonderful. He thinks I just don't like sateen in general so maybe that's it. Overall they are nice though just not what I personally had expected"
2,Wrinkles galore,"These sheets get more wrinkly than any other sheets we've ever owned. The color looks very nice, but the wrinkles ruin it. They're reasonably comfortable, but not nearly as good as the charter club macy's sheets that we use on our main bed.Thread count is overrated. Don't buy into that hype."
4,Really nice,"These are really nice. I bought two sets, one teal and one off white. The teal sheets are not as soft as the off white ones. I don't know why. But they are still worth the money."
3,sheets,the sheets are nice but the color was far from what was pictured.They are all wrinkles but I should have noticed they are not permapressed.
4,A little stiff,"So I purchased a white set and the main reason I bought these sheets as I was looking for a decent price, as well as, for sheets that would fit an extra thick mattress. These fit the bill. After washing them, and then laying down in them they felt a little stiff. Kinda like I was staying in a hotel. I was disappointed, but I have to say after you lay in them for a few days they start of feel softer. I would definitely buy another set."
5,Great for the Price,"I usually review books but let me break ranks here to jot down a couple of notes about these sheets. We had some gift certificates hanging around and decided to blow them on some quality sheets. Based on the Amazon reviews we eventually went with these and have been very pleasantly surprised. I can't say that they are ultra-soft, but neither was I expecting satin or silk. They are certainly not, as some have stated, like sleeping on hard canvas. Really, my only hesitation is that they are noisy. When you move about between these sheets--rolling over or trying to slip quietly out of bed--they make a lot of noise! But unless the person sharing your bed is an exceedingly light sleeper, I can't imagine that will be much of an issue.These sheets are great value and well worth owning."
4,So freakin soft!,Nice sheets. So silky smooth. The only drawback is they aren't quite as dark as the picture made them out to be but no matter. My eyes are closed when I am asleep.
1,"King size doesn't fit, cheap feeling sheets","Ordered king size, white. They aren't incredibly soft, they're very heavy, probably too hot for summer. And they do not fit my mattress (pillow top)very well. There's no way the flat sheet will be able to be tucked in at the sides at all. Also, very wrinkly after drying. I guess you get what you pay for. These are no better than cheap Walmart sheets, which do fit better. So if you just want cheap sheets, get them from Walmart. If you want luxury sheets, I guess you do have to spend more."
1,Cheap Material,Sheets only lasted two washes and then started to fall apart. The sheets start to pill after the first use. Would not recommend this product.
1,Terrible,"Quality is terrible! These things are terrible!! So think you can see your hand right through them. I had to send them back. There was no way I could keep them, and make due!"
2,Scratchy & Itchy,I do not believe this is 600 thread count. I washed it right out of the package before using it and was stunned at how acratchy the sheet set was. Even after a second washing. I do not recommend this sheet set.
2,California King size is too small/stiff,"We got a set of these sheets a few weeks ago and immediately noticed that the top sheet wasn't wide enough. In fact, after washing, the top sheet barely reached the edge of the bed on both sides. We did try them out for a night, but the small size combined with the stiffness of the sheets was a deal breaker.As a side note, the fitted sheet fit just fine - although it was still made from the same stiff material.Other reviewers have mentioned that different sizes seem to made differently, so be aware that this review only applies to the California King size.I would not recommend getting these sheets in the California King size."
3,Good but not Great,"Nice sheets, fit my queen size bed with pillow top perfectly. Feel great but the color in the picture does not represent what I received. Cafe is more of a dark gold then brown. Still matches my comforter and bedroom set. Maybe a 4 star product if the picture was correct."
2,Cafe?- not really,"These are really nice sheets. They look nice and feel nice. HOWEVER- the color i chose was Cafe. It looks like a light brown/beige online. When they arrived, they were GOLD. Now they dont match my bedding. Just watch your color selection."
4,Great item for a decent price,"My husband and I have used many Egyptian Cotton sheet sets, so this is the first time we purchased and used a sateen sheet set at the same thread count (600). I honestly don't really see much differences between the two. The sateen sheet set is soft, nice and cool, a little wrinkly sometimes but it too happened with my Egyptian cotton sheet set. It hold well after washing, you just have to remove the whole set out immediately after drying to avoid it getting wrinkly (it's just common sense.) For the prices I pay, I'm thinking of getting another Chocolate or Ivory sateen sheet set in the near future. Very recommended this product!"
1,Stiff and Wrinkly,"The sheets were very stiff. Even after washing, they came out stiff and very very wrinkly. I would not recommend them to anyone."
1,Cheap sheets,These sheets do not feel like they're anything close to 600 thread count. I returned them immediately and that process went very smooth.
4,nice sheets,"These are very nice sheets, the color is great and they feel good, but not quite amazing. I'm not sure if it's the sateen or what, but they aren't as soft as I had hoped for 600 thread count. They do seem very sturdy and I think they will last a long time."
2,Naw,"Read the reviews. Was hoping for a set of affordable, quality bed sheets like the set I got from Sears years ago that were recommended and I still have and use. But, no. Just average feel while being a little heavy."
1,Less than happy,"I know you should never depend on the colors shown on the computer, but when I ordered STONE sheets, what arrived was very cafe au lait. I was hoping for taupe with a lot of gray as the picture showed.Then I washed them, before I used them for the first time, and the seams fell apart.I ordered HONEY sheets and they turned out to be mustard colored.If I could give less than one star, I would."
4,Good sheets,"These are thick and soft, but still breathable. I don't sweat overnight in these the way in do in some other sateen sheets, and they're deep enough that I don't have to fight to fit them over the corners of our mattress. A good bargain overall."
1,Not good,These sheets DO NOT feel like 600 thread count! My old sheets are 400 and they feel much softer. I would not reccommend this product if you want soft sheets. They also barely fit on my bed.
4,More Mustard than Cafe brown,Not crazy about the color. Definitely a mustard color and not the taupe/brown color in the photo. Love the sheets though. After I had found that my Hotel collection sheets from Bed Bath & Beyond had been discontinued I came to Amazon and found these sheets. Great sheets for the price. For those who have never had sheets like these they do wrinkle when taken out of the dryer (even on permanent press). But after several washes they soften and the wrinkles become less and less. Within a day of sleeping on them the wrinkles are gone anyway. Good value and am going to buy another set.
3,Terrible color match for Cafe',"I recently purchased these Renaissance 600 thread count sheets in ""cafe"", I chose the color based on the sample colors provided. The online picture of the ""cafe"" sheets shows them to be beige/taupe, however, I just received the package (with ""cafe"" on the label), and the sheets are GOLD!!!! These seem to be good quality sheets, however, they are not even close to the ""cafe"" in the picture provided. The seller should correct this misreprentation immediately!"
1,As soft as.... sandpaper.,"I was so excited to purchase the 600 TC Sateen sheets! I couldn't wait for them to arrive, wash them, and put them on my bed. Much to my disappointment, however, these sheets are anything from soft and comfortable. It was like sleeping on the cheapest hotel sheets you can imagine. I've washed them at least a dozen times, using excessive amounts of fabric softener and dryer sheets to try and make them softer. I have not yet succeeded in that. The deal I got would have been impressive if only the sheets were worth what I paid. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. Sorry."
3,"Lovely color, but stiff...","These are a great price for a sheet set; I bought them in merlot and they're a deep wine color; however, they're a little stiff (so much so that my elbows got a bit chaffed from rolling over at night). They're definitely worth the price, but they're not my favorite set. I'll continue to wash them to see if they get softer with time."
1,Bottom too big; top too small,"The bottom sheet fits like a king size sheet at the foot of the mattress and is smaller at the top of the mattress. None of the corners line up nicely on my new pillow-top queen size mattress. Also, the elastic is very poor quality.The top sheet fits like a full-size sheet and barely covers a queen mattress. These sheets are poorly assembled. Very disappointed."
3,Slightly disappointed,"Not crazy about these sheets. The chocolate color is rich and has a nice sheen. For 500 thread count, I didn't think that they have the soft satiny feel to them. I tried to iron the pillow cases and the wrinkles did not want to come out. I am anxious to see what happens when I wash them."
4,Nice Sheet Set,"Renaissance 600 Thread Count 100% Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set, CaféVery nice sheet set, Bought on a whim when ordering other stuff and am very satisfied. They have a Silk feel to them and don't shrink much when washing them. But best of all they are roomy enough to fit well under the mattress so they don't pull out as I sleep, Unlike some other Sheet sets that have been known to do so.I plan to order a few more sets in the near future.Well worth the money."
1,Missing the fitted sheet.,"Was excited for this item and have yet to use it but the color and quality look nice. Only problem is this order was for a 4-piece set: flat sheet, fitted sheet, and 2 king size pillowcases. I did NOT receive a fitted sheet, which to be quite honest was the main reason why I ordered this item. I did not see where I could contact somebody so that this issue may be resolved so please contact me (sahak_ghaghian@yahoo.com) cause I really would like to receive my fitted sheet.Thanks!"
5,Nice,"Compared to the bed-in-a-bag sheets we had, this is wonderful! So thick, soft...the color is beautiful, rich looking - love the chocolate! Fit is good, even with a pillow top mattress and a mattress pad under it."
1,Terrible!!,"I read the reviews before ordering and thought surely the bad reviews were just complainiers who wouldn't be satisfied with anything. But I must say these sheets are TERRIBLE! They fit perfectly and were soft, but after the 2nd wash they are pilled up and feel like sandpaper. Am now using them to cover plants outside during a freeze."
2,Crappy Sheets,"I'm sorry but these are not sateen sheets. I have been buying sateen sheets for 15 years. They are getting harder to find so I was thrilled when I found this set for only $45. When I got them, it was a major disappointment. They are not soft, at all (even after washing). Also, like another reviewer said, the cafe color looks nothing like the picture. Wish I could return but that's not an option since I washed them. Would not recommend. Stick with what you know and don't fall for something that says high quality just because the price is good - lesson learned!"
5,Wow,"I know a lot of people complain that these sheets feel itchy and uncomfortable.This is not my experience with them. I ordered the chocolate color in the queen size for a full size bed with a mattress topper.Out of the box they felt stiff and starchy.I could not sleep on it at first because it was itchy and rough, but after only one wash they felt amazing.I am thoroughly impressed.I was very hesitant in buying these because of all the mixed reviews but for the past month my wife and I have had a hard time getting out of bed because it is so comfortable now.We have washed them at least 5 or 6 times now and they get better every time.It was definitely worth it.If you are very picky about your bed sheets I would suggest picking out some at a place where you can feel them before you buy. Otherwise these are a great buy."
1,Bad Sheets!!! Itchy and rough after first wash!,"I have never once posted a review for anything, ever, and I am a huge online shopper. When you first take these sheets out of the box they fee wonderful. After you wash them they are scratchy and made me feel itchy. True sheets of the quality this brand ""advertises"" feel great for a long time, this is not the case with this product. I feel that I wasted my money and would never advise someone to buy these sheets, go to Marshalls of TJ Maxx over buying this item."
2,Rough and Scratchy,I bought these Sateen Sheets in hopes that it would be the smooth cool feel of sheets that you would get at a nice hotel. After numerous washes and fabric softener additions I realized that these sheets would never soften up and that I had made a poor purchase. If you want the soft feel of nice sheets I would not recommend these sheets. I bought Pure Beech Sateen Sheets from BBB and they were perfect right out of the box with one wash to make sure they were clean.
5,divine sheets,really amazing sheets. so soft and just the right the right amount of silky. The best sheets I have ever slept on.... and I have slept on lots of different sheets!
2,The seems are falling apart,"I washed the sheets before I used them the first time, and I noticed that one of the seams on the pillow case was torn. After washing them a second time, a seam on the sheet also ripped.The material is nice. The workmanship, not so much!"
1,Renaissance 600 thread count sheet set,These sheets are very wrinkled and stiff after laundering. I would not purchase them again.
2,600-Thread Sheets,"I was disappointed in 1) The color wasn't what I wanted, I wanted cafe brown, not gold...2) The sheets don't feel like they are 600-Thread countI would not buy these kind of sheets again.But there are okay.."
2,Fitted sheet corners are too long,"If you have a regular maattress, beware of buying this sheeet set! The corners of the fitted sheet are so deep that every night, they all come up from off the mattress, just from moving around."
3,Good Quality,"Enjoyed these sheets but the color is weired.....sort of a mustard gold. I'm getting used to it but the price was right and they feel good. Besides, no one can see the color with the lights off!!"
4,Great Sheets,"I always read the reviews for products I purchase on line before ordering them because no matter what the manufacturer or seller thinks it is really the ""man on the street"" that I trust. I have nothing to gain by saying this product is good, other than to tell you why in case you were thinking of ordering them. They are stronger than so many of the high thread count sheets and don't feel like they will shred after you use them a few times. I like a more robust sheet (ala 200 thread count) but with a softer feel to them. These sheets fit the bill, and being made for taller mattresses, they also fit the bed properly. If you are looking for sheets that feel like you are sleeping on a well worn favorite tshirt, these are not for you, but if you are looking for sheets that get softer with each washing but appear to hold up to regular use, buy these sheets."
5,First set of 600 thread count sheets...,And now I'll never go back to anything less. These sheets are amazingly comfortable
1,Don't BUY!!!,"Before I bought these sheets I had 300 thread count sheets. I was super excited about 600 thread count and that it said Sateen. When you think about Sateen you think soft, silky, and smooth. Well, I got none of those. These sheets feel like cardboard. My 300 thread count sheet are softer then these trash bags. IT STATES SATEEN, it's actually a horrible cotton.Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
2,Not worth more than $20.00,"This can NOT be 600 Thread Count. It is super thin and is not as soft as the $12.00 bed sheets I bought at Wal-Mart. The sheets look nice, but that is where it ends. Not happy paying so much money for poor quality."
1,Not 600 Thread Count,"These sheets are awful!!! They are so rough and itchy. I washed them multiple times to see if they would get softer, but that was not the case. I am shocked that Amazon can sell theses claiming that they are 600 tc and sateen. I have a set of 500 tc that are so much softer and nicer than these. I couldn't sleep on these for one night. They are so uncomfortable and made me break out in hives and made me itch all over. Worst sheets I have ever owned!!! Very disappointed in these sheets and in Amazon!"
3,ACTUAL COLOR DOESN'T MATCH DESCRIPTION,"I read the reviews and there were some negative comments about the actual color not matching the description. I thought some of the reviewers were expecting too much and were just being extremely critical of the color. Disregarding the negative color comments, I ordered the ""cafe"" color sheets. The ""cafe"" color should have been listed as ""gold"". Even for a good price, I couldn't settle with the gold color. I returned the sheets with no problem for a full refund. I'm hesitant to buy sheets online. Reviews for other brands seem to have the same comments regarding color not matching the description."
3,Okay,"Okay quality, the sheen color fades fast, cafe color really looks Gold, makes alot of noise, okay for price"
3,More golden color than pictured,"The sheets are a nice quality, but the color is much more gold than the set appears in the picture - they perfectly match ""gold"" sheets that I already own. Other than that, they are a nice quality that would be enhanced by touch-up ironing after removing from the drier."
3,I guess thread count is not everything,"The sheets are ok but I expected too much of them in terms of Summer use satisfaction. In fact they don't seem to be much--if any-- better than my other regular sheets. They are, however prettier."
3,Product is not wrinkle free,"My objection to these sheets is the fact that they are not wrinkle free. They are heavy and will last many years. Once they are on the bed it's not much of a problem, but still wish I had questioned whether they had this quality. If I had known this I would have waited until I could find the wrinkle free sheets."
3,"Good quality, but wrong color description.","I ordered what I thought was cafe color (thinking a light brown looking at the picture), and when the sheets arrived they were more like gold....Decided to keep them anyway because they were a great deal and good quality, but definitely not the color I was expecting. Somewhat disappointing."
5,BEST sheets I have ever owned!,"These are by far the best sheets I have ever owned. Theyre so thick, and comfortable. Not like those cheap see through sheets you buy at walmart. The color is a little more of a orangish brown then the gold that it advertises though, but great sheets non the less"
3,Color wasn't the same,"I ordered the cafe sheets...but they didn't look anything like the picture, they had too much yellow in them. This is the risk that you take when ordering on line. They seem like great sheets at a good deal, but I had to return them because color is too important. Other people have been satisfied, so I hope I don't sway your opinion too much, I just wanted to let other shoppers know. Amazon has a great and easy return process which is nice!"
5,Great Sheets,"I have had these sheets for only a few days now but I absolutely love them! I ordered them in chocolate, the color is amazing! They are very smooth and have very deep pockets that fit well on my oversized pillowtop mattress."
4,Nice,"I have begun to use it as soon as it arrived at my door, loved it, and the color looks elegant."
4,"Nice, but not as soft as expected","I received these about a week ago, washed and dried them, and then put them on my bed. So far they seem to be thick, fairly good quality sheets, but not quite as soft as I would expect from a 600 thread count. I'm hoping they will soften up with a few more washings. They wrinkle like crazy though so you would need to spend some time ironing them if that kind of thing is important to you. I would have given them three stars, but since the price was so low, I gave them four. For the price, they are a decent value, but don't expect to be getting ""luxury"" sheets at this price."
2,Hole in sheet,"I previously wrote a good review for these sheets. However, after two weeks of use, I discovered a small hole in the fitted sheet - about 1/8 inch in diameter.I used an iron-on patch to fix it. Not worth the trouble of returning the sheets.First time I have ever encountered a hole in new sheets. Other than that, I like the sheets, but now would not buy them again."
3,Didn't like the color,"The other similar sheets I bought from Amazon were fine, but I returned these pale green ones because the color reminded me of pea soup.Amazon handled the return easily, and even reimbursed me the cost of shipping them back. Thanks Amazon!"
3,disappointed,"Thought that these sheets would have a slight satin feel to them the way that similarly worded sheets have felt. Instead they feel like somewhat stiff cotton. There is nothing wrong with them. But I feel they would've been better suited for my son's room than mine. My wife is also somewhat disappointed in the feel. They, however, are fine quality."
5,Great sheets for the price,"I really like these sheets, I got them in the chocolate and the cafe. The chocolate is really rich and pretty, the cafe is definitely gold, as other reviewers have said before. I like my sheets a little crisp, but they are not scratchy. Other reviewers have said they wrinkle easily, and they do, but who really cares about wrinkled sheets? If you aren't getting your sheets wrinkled, then your bed is a little boring eh? Overall, I like the sheets and I will probably get another set in the ivory."
3,Color is Gold,"For the price, these sheets seem great, but I sent mine back because the color is more of a mustard-gold."
4,"Feels great. Nice, cool, and soft.","These sheets improved our sleep with their great comfort. They are well worth the money as I have bought other high thread count sheets which were thinner, and not as soft.The color is a little off than what I expected. Ours were more orange/gold than expected. Not quite the cafe color or khaki color I really wanted.As far as everything else goes, I love this purchase."
3,Not so soft,The color is deep and rich but I thought these sheets would be softer or silkier than they are for 600 Thread-Count.
4,nice sheets,"I really like these sheets, I ordered a second set after I saw the quality of the first, definitely would recommend them."
2,Wrinkley,"We have a smaller mattress from Ikea that sits on the slats so these sheets ended up being so big I have a hard time putting them on the bed right without a few adjustments. Also they do not ""un wrinkle"" in the dryer at all. I am not one who irons my sheets if people even do that anymore. So they come out of the dryer a wrinkley mess."
3,Sheets are morphing,"These sheets are ""pilling"" some as I use them, but I'm not throwing them away. I have slept in the mud and rain, so let me tell you these sheets are a lot better."
5,5 Stars,"Quality and beauty best discribes these sheets. Because I'd gotten a set of these sheets for myself several months ago (and they are still doing great), I felt good about getting this set as a gift for somebody dear to me."
2,shrunk,Both top & fitted sheets shrunk quite a bit. Fitted sheet will no longer fit properly over the mattress. I quit using this set because it is so aggreviating!
1,Thin and too small!,"These may be 600TC, but they are very thin. Thinner and not as soft as my 310 TC Northern Nights set. The top sheet is also small. It comes untucked and my husband and I are constantly playing tug of war. Not fun. I'll pay a little more and get Northern Nights via QVC from now on!"
3,"Ordered Fennel, got Lime Green",Used Super saving shipping & it came about 5 early. Thats the only good thing. Ordered Fennel got Lime green. The sheets were Pretty stiff and after one wash they got slightly softer. Ive Ordered 300 count sheets that were softer but the life span was pretty short. There good sheets ...could be a little softer. Other than that there OK. Im not a wrinkle freak so thats not a biggie:-).
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED1,"These sheets, are not 100% cotton as described! The top sheet in my Queen size in Ivory clearly states on the tag that it is a cotton polyester blend! If your looking for all-cotton sheets don't buy these. They are nice for a blend, but I would have never bought them if not for the misleading product description. Due to the misleading description I'm giving these sheets a zero rating, although you can't rank them less than one star. If I'd wanted a poly blend I'd have rated them much higher."
2,Not 100% cotton sateen.,I purchased these sheets and they looked very nice out of package until I looked on the tags sewn inside to wash. The only sheet that is 100% cotton is the bottom sheet. The top sheet and 2 pillowcases are 60% cotton and 45% polyester. Has anyone else looked at the tags sewn inside to see if this is the same in your set? I do not know if I got a mismatched set but the RN number on the bottom of each tag states it is made in India and the RN number is the same on each tag - just the tags state cotton blend on everything except the fitted sheet. Please let me know if you have come across this. I do not know if I should exchange or find another set.
4,Excellent value for money,I love these sheets! We got them in the light green color. They are super soft and look very ritzy! You cant beat the quality you get for the price. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that it came with a run that went all down the fitted sheet. Also it came out of the dryer very wrinkled and the washing tag said minimal ironing. The run is barely noticeable and didnt want to return the sheets because I had already used them. All in all a very good purchase for the money and I will go back and buy in other colors!
1,They Shrink,I purchased two sets of these sheets in chocolate brown six months ago. When I received these sheets I was pleased that they were large enough to fit my bed easily. I change my sheets weekly so with two sets they have been washed twice a month for 6 months and with each washing they have shrunk and putting them on the bed has become more and more difficult until yesterday when I couldn't stretch the bottom sheet far enough to get it on the bed at all and the top sheet barely covers the top of the bed. The sheets are now in the trash.
2,Not what I wanted...,"I think I will stick with buying sheets at Marshall's or other outlet type stores. The color is way too gold for my taste and my decor, and they are not at all soft. Making a live purchase allows you to feel--although pre-washed linens can be deceiving, and check the real color. I am happy that they are oversize, I have a big mattress, but that is really the only thing I like about these sheets. In fact I am not even happy that they are heavy duty, I would love for them to wear out sooner so I can justify purchasing a new set."
3,Not the quality I thought it would be.,"I expected these sheets to be really soft but they aren't. I have other Sateen sheets in 200 and 300 count which are really soft, but these don't even come close. I've had them for 2 months so they've been through a lot of washings, but I'd have to say they are average. I still think it was a great deal for them, so I got my money's worth."
1,WRINKLES!!!!,"If you never wash these, they're fine. If you do have to ever wash them, buy an iron. ARGHHHHH. I wish I had a better product."
1,Terrible pilling after several washes and a month of use,"These sheets look nice and were quite soft after the second wash, but after the third wash and approximately a month of use, they began to pill all over. They now look and feel cheap. I'm very disappointed because I have purchased similarly priced 600 thread-count sheets on Amazon before that lasted for many years before wearing out. I feel ripped off."
4,Good but a bit pricey,"Good thick quality. Plenty soft. 4 stars because the top sheet to me is too small, no tuck in on a deep mattress which the fitted sheet is sized for! Bit pricey as Costco has the same for about $40! BTW, Made In India. Don't we make sheets in the US anymore?"
3,Sheets are off-white instead of the white that was indicated,"The sheets are an off white when I was expecting white white. Also, they are not as soft as I expected. The hem at the top is not straight and must be ironed to even be semi acceptable."
1,Sheets arrived with a stain!,"These sheets are of good quality material, but after opening them we noticed a one inch diameter stain (possibly a blood stain) on the fitted sheet. We needed this sheet immediately, so we laundered it with various stain-removers. The stain remains. The question is ... how could a ""new"" sheet have a stain on it. I would not buy from this vendor again."
5,SHEET SNOB HERE,"Disclaimer: I won't even put sheets on my bed that don't pass my eye/feeling test. I am VERY picky, and I run hot at night so I need something that will stay cool.These sheets PASS the test. I wash them in cold water and dry them on low heat and haven't had any shrinking problems. They are some of the most comfortable sheets I've ever slept on. I love white sheets, because I have dogs and they allow me to throw a little bleach in with my washer loads and they go back to new (plus the bleach makes em crispy just like I like em). I will be buying backup sets from here again, regardless of price. You sleep a 1/3 of your life, no cost is too much."
2,Bottom sheet wouldn't fit!,"I'm SO disappointed that the bottom sheet didn't fit when I got these sheets. I've put off buying nice sheets because of the cost, but I finally took the plunge. When I put the bottom sheet on my 14"" mattress (supposed to have 16"" pockets and fit up to 18""), I couldn't get it over the one of the corners. I tugged and tugged and barely got it over the top of the pillow top but I know it will pop off when I lay on it. I love the feel and weight of the sheets, but I'm so disappointed the bottom sheet doesn't fit. I would return them, but it's such a hassle because I don't have the original box and don't have time to box it up to send back. I may change my mind if I get too aggravated with it popping off. The top sheet and pillow cases are just fine. Why don't they have better quality control????"
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"I usually have great success with the products I purchase through Amazon. This product was an extreme disappointment. I washed these sheets exactly as recommended and I could barely stretch the fitted sheet across my mattress. If they shrink anymore in future washings, they will not fit at all. Unfortunately, I washed both sets that I purchased before I tried one set on the bed. I will now have to purchase sheets again very soon."
2,"Alright, but awful color - not like what is shown on image!","The sheets themselves are ok, (not that soft for 600, but not falling apart). The color however was not at all what I was expecting. I ordered the ""cafe"" color expecting brown, however the color of the sheets that came in packaging marked as ""cafe"" was an awful deep goldish-tan, not at all brown. Very colorful, but not in a good way (at least not when you are expecting something brown) and not in the way the sheets were advertised at all. I don't know if they screwed up and gave me the ""honey"" color, but the color was very dark - so when looking at the picture look at the top pillowcases - not the sheets below that seem to be more pale in the picture."
2,Not well-made,"Although I rather liked the stiff quality of the sheets - reminded me of sheets that have been hung to dry outside - my fitted sheet ripped at two of the corner seams within about three washings. No, I don't have all that deep a mattress and no, I didn't pull all that hard on the corners. They just aren't very durable. I have another pair from Costco - same thread count - and they're much better made."
1,DISAPPOINTED!,"Don't be like me, READ the Reviews on this item! Sheets are of a lesser quality than i expected! the fabric pills after just a few washes! DO NOT BUY THESE SHEETS!"
1,Terrible!,"Don't believe this 600-thread-B.S. After one wash (and I do mean O-N-E), the glossy finish was gone and I was left with nothing short of card board. It's extremely dissapointing b/c I opened the package and felt the smooth, cool to the touch, softness of the material and was really excited to put them on. But now they're so stiff, cheap walmart sheets feel like silk in comparison. Sadly, some of you might still give these sheets the benefit of doubt with all the good reviews it's got going for it. I just hope you have softer water than me, cause my sheets are unbearable."
2,Bulletproof,"These are the most versitile sheets on the market. They are bulletproof, rough and can be used for collecting leaves in the yard, painting drop cloth, and other heavy industrial uses. I can imagine wet they could cut through steel too. Also sandpaper, 100 grit or emery paper to sand down pipes or deburr copper pipesYou can sleep on them too, and if someone tries to shoot you while you sleep these sheets will probably stop a .45 round at close range. Soft? Hell no, we don't need soft. These sheets are so hard they probably will be used to line hulls of the new battleships.Get the picture?"
2,Stiff and scratchy,"I just can't fathom all these positive reviews... the reviews gave me the confidence to buy the sheets, and after carefully washing in cold water and a cool dry, they came out thick, stiff, and scratchy. They're just not smooth and soft at ALL -- after washing a couple times. What a disappointment. How in the world is this ""sateen?"""
1,"Fairly soft out of the package, sandpaper after washing.","The sheets were soft straight out of the package and I decided to follow the washing instructions. The end result was an extremely rough set of sheets that were horribly stiff. My previous set of sheets was a cheap 200tc set from Walmart (yeah, Walmart...) until I could get decent sheets for my new bed and they were way softer than these sheets. Terrible, terrible sheets. Steer clear of these. I thought with 500 reviews and 4/5 stars they couldn't be that bad. I was wrong. I still have the unwashed pillowcases and the difference between the two is like night and day. They also say sateen... but they sure as heck don't look/feel like it.I wouldn't recommend these sheets to anyone."
2,Sheet Set,This purchase is disappointing. Sheets are stiff for sateen and the color is not true to the advertisement on line. Cafe looks more gold; not an attractive color.
4,So comfy!!,These sheets are so pretty and really comfy/silky. THey are tough to get wrinkles out though!
1,MUST READ BEFORE BUYING!,"Hello there, Im writing a review about 4 months after purchasing this product. First off when I got these sheets they were great...had that nice thick 600 thread feeling. These sheets were purchased so I could trade out my other ones for these ones in case I didn't have time to get washed and put on immediately.After about 8-10x washing I noticed a piling up of the fabric! This was very frustrating cause I know that 600 Thread count sheets shouldn't do that! I cannot stand feeling that piling of the fabric while sleeping.So please take as a helpful hint because I wish I had listened to other peoples similar reviews. I just passed by thinking what a great Deal being only $50 (which I noticed now they are $60!) and reading other peoples great reviews. (which I think they did the review right when they got the sheets and not after some washing)"
5,Everyone should have such sheets!,"This is my third purchase of the Renaissance 600-Thread Count Cotton Sateen sheets. The most luxurious sheets I have ever encountered was when vacationing in a 5 star hotel in Germany. I looked all over for those sheets only to be told that they sold for over $300.00 a set. Comparable sheet sets for a King sized bed have ran between $100-$150.00.I have never found the quality of these sheets matched elsewhere, even in costly 800 thread and 1200 thread count sheets. I am a return customer x 4. I think everyone should have sheets like these and feel like you are sleeping in a 5 start hotel every night. Great product, great service, great shipping and great company!SusanStafford, VA"
1,Color not even close,"The color of these sheets is Gold, not cafe or any shade of tan or brown as shown in the photo. Totally unacceptable. Returned them."
2,Just OK,"I received my sheets last week. I washed them, according to package instructions, and was prepared for a good night sleep. To my dismay, the sheets were not comfortable. I like my sheet's soft. I tossed all night. I noticed some of the previous reviews stated the sheets were a little on the thick side,but I thought it wouldn't be a problem for me. I was wrong. Last year I ordered sheets from Amazon(Pinzon 500 thread count egyptian Sateen) and I loved them!! They are my favorite set. I've been waiting on the chocolate color Pinzon sheets to go on sale (currently it's over $100 dollars!) but I got tired of waiting and decided to try this set instead. I should have waited. Save your money, buy the Pinzon sheets. You won't be dissappointed."
3,misleading,"I read a lot of reviews before buying these sheets and whoever said that these sheets are not 100% cotton was 100% correct. I bought the queen sized ivory set and while the fitted sheet is 100% cotton, the pillowcases and flat sheet are 55% cotton and 45% polyester. I am planning on keeping the sheets because they are still very nice and feel like high quality sheets but the listing should not say 100% cotton, it is false advertising!"
2,Displeased,"This is a white, queen-sized set. Made in China. Washed as directed before using. Came out extremely wrinkled. Numerous small wrinkles that seem set in. Fabric is stiff and rustles audibly. Top sheet is too narrow. Have washed it several times since with fabric softener. No real help. The set will be put away and saved for emergencies. Very displeased. It seems that products like this are supplied by various factories from various countries with little attempt at consistent quality control. Well, the set was inexpensive, but really not a bargain."
2,Disappointing,"Nowhere near as soft as a true 600 count sheet set should be. Second, the color did not match the photo. Third, it looked to be of poor quality coming out of the dryer for the first time. A waste of money."
4,excellent quality but runs big,This set is of totally incredible quality. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that it runs way too big. It could easity fit a king size mattress.
3,Comfy but not satin like,"These sheets felt soft and heavy with a rich luscious color. I washed them before I used them. The only reason I gave them such a low rating is that they were not satin like at all. They are very nice sheets but, not what I thought they would be."
1,Turned to sandpaper after three washes,These sheets were great at first but they quickly started pilling after just a few washes. We have had the sheets for about six weeks and they are very uncomfortable.
2,ripped and frayed sheets,"I received my Renaissance Collection 600-Thread-Count Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set, Cafe, but there was a big problem. One side of the flat sheet was frayed, and one corner of the fitted sheet was torn!"
2,wrong color,Expected to get a coffee colored or latte colored sheet from the description and they are ugly gold. Feel good but color is completely misrepresented.
4,Good Product,"Prompt delivery and overall a nice product. The sheets didn't seem as soft as I expected them to be at 600 thread count at first, but after a week or so, they softened up a lot. I recommend this product for anyone who doesn't want to pay too much for sheets."
3,Love them...for a while.,"When I first got these sheets I loved them so much I commented on them every night when I got into bed. They feel SOOO soft, and the texture reminds me of a very fine microsuede. The Cafe color is closer to a tawny gold than a taupe, and that's really what I wanted.After a while though, they did start to pill up just a little bit. Now, this may not bother most people, but I'm something of a princess and the pea, and those little pills do bother me, and now I'm a little disappointed."
4,Good but not great,I bought the king size set in Cafe. Not too bad. Good price. Worth it.They could be softer to the touch especially because they are sateen but considering their cost I think they're a good buy. The color was a good match to the image in the listing.
1,Scratchy,"These sheets are not soft like other egyptian cotton sheets I own, even after a few washes. I do not recommend them!"
1,Sooooo wrinkled!!!,"These sheets looked so nice in the packaging. I always wash sheets, etc. before using them so I washed them as I do my other sheets and they came out of the dryer so wrinkled that there is no way I would recommend them. I am now in the process of seeing if I can return them even though I have washed them.Renaissance 600-Thread-Count Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set, Ivory"
3,narrow,"These sheets run small and are too narrow for a tempurpedic mattress.Even though they have deep enough pockets,the width is just short of fitting."
2,Ruff!,"These sheets are advertised as ""Sateen"" and they are anything but. Even after gentle washing, cool drying and fabric softener, they remain rough to the touch. Plus, they wrinkle terribly! A ""dog"" of a prioduct."
3,Not too bad,"They are ok, but they are not soft. I've washed mine probably 4 or 5 times now. They are definitely not sateen in any way."
2,beware,Not happy with purchase. This sheetset does not feel like it is 600 thread count. Am disappointed with purchase. Will stick to CostCo next time.
3,Renaissance sateen sheets,"These are fairly nice sheets. They do shrink alot even though I wash them in cold water. And I would not consider them sateen, which is what I really wanted.I probably wouldn't buy them again."
4,Good value,"Nice sheets overall, good value, only one defect with the hem that we fixed. As advertised at 100% satin cotton."
4,Soft comfort.,"These sheets were perfect. They are soft, crisp and beautiful. I highly recommend themIf you are wanting soft sheets without paying big buck."
2,not pleased,"I purchased this item twice. The first time I had to return it because the top sheet was way too short for our bed. They replaced it, but after several washings, the top sheet barely fits our bed."
3,Good Sheet Set,"This is a good sheet set for the price, however, along with these, I ordered another set of theRenaissance 600 Thread-Count Woven Stripe Queen Sheet Set, Ivoryfrom the same company, Elite Home, and those sheets where superior to this set. Both were advertised as Renaissance 600 Thread-Count but the Ivory Striped set are remarkably smoother than this set...."
5,Holy Cow!,"Super sheets at a great price, extra large king size. I am pleased to get a good buy every now and then and this was my time!"
3,Bottom line these Sheets ARE NOT SOFT!,"I bought these sheets, and I will say that they are thick, and feel very well made, but for me the main draw was 600 thread count and I read the advertisement which said Sateen in the title, which I interpreted to mean really soft. Sadly, they are not soft, they are made out of a thick cotton material. Would they hold up for a long time? Absolutely, are they what they should be, well for me the answer is no, but for $39.99 perhaps at that price they are OK. I would rate them a C-. Bottom line the Ad says ""Sateen"" which I thought meant soft. I am going to try the Bamboo sheets that are offered through Amazon for $99.99."
5,wonderful sheets,"These sheets are an excellent value, soft, well made, high thread count. I highly recommend them!"
4,Nice Sheets,"The sheets are very nice and also a great buy for what you get, I just thought they would be a little more softer, being 600 count."
3,Cafe Sheets,"The sheets feel great, however, they were not ""Cafe"" when I got them. They were more a mustard seed yellow."
5,Love these sheets,These sheets have a substantial feel to them and do not wrinkle easily. I did not find them stiff at all and they have a wonderful sheen. I'm definitely very pleased with my purchase.
2,Bought on amazon,"I ordered these a few months back. I have washed them a few times and they feel scratchy. The fitted sheet barely fits on our queen bed. I don't think they are horrible, just wouldn't buy again. Hope this helps!"
3,"Really nice sheets, but careful with pocket size","Loved the quality of these sheets and great value. However, they are a bit oversized. If the packaging says UP TO 17"" then assume your bed needs to be AT LEAST 17"" high in order for them to fit properly. If your bed is even an inch smaller (as was the case with our bed) don't purchase."
5,Thrilled with my creamy feeling sheets!,"I ordered these on the one day special. One thing I noticed in the reviews is that color choice matters. I was wavering between two colors but I saw that people who bought them in ""cafe"" gave the sheets positive reviews. It seems that some colors may not be of the same quality.The cafe ones are just what I wanted, though! The color is more like a butterscotch, and the feel is soft and creamy. They came out of the wash better than just out of the package. I bought two sets and I never have to go a night without them."
4,Be careful with the color. Cafe is GOLD !!!,"I ordered the sheets in cafe, but the actual color was a mixture of gold and orange. The color was not what I expected , but it didn't clash with my bedroom color, so I kept them. If you are looking for a brown earthy tone, do not go for cafe. Instead, choose a lighter color. About the quality, the sheets were soft and didn't bother my skin, but they got really wrinkly after they were washed.. but you can always iron them. Overall, the sheets are worth their price."
2,"good value, poor quality, sheets pilled instantly.","At first I thought this was a great deal on very nice, high thread count sheet set. However I guess you get what you pay for because after the second wash, the entire sheet set pilled up. I read a few other reviews saying this...my sheet set was ivory, perhaps the white doesn't pill?? I was very careful to wash according to the instructions on the label! Now after the 4th wash these sheets feel like sand paper and will have to be replaced soon. My previous sheet set lasted for 6 years without any pilling, this manufacturing is sub-par. Perhaps I got 40 dollars of value from them, but I can NOT recommend these sheets at all, unless it's for a kid's halloween costume or to use as a drop-cloth. Terrible product."
2,Disapointed,"I was disapointed in these sheets and pillow cases. When I first opened them they looked great. After 1 washing the finish was no longer there. I would not buy them again.Renaissance 600 Thread Count 100% Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set, WhiteRenaissance 600 Thread Count 100% Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set, White"
1,Not colorfast,"While these sheets feel great, on the first wash the color bled. A lot! The bleeding continues with each wash. These sheets now have giant colorless blotches all over them. They were always laundered per instruction. They are only a few months old and they are useless."
3,"Some from India, some from China","I bought 2 sets of these sheets in King size White. They were packaged well, came quickly and were as described. BUT - one set was ""made in India"" and one set was ""made in China."" The made in India set were noticable softer, with what appeared to be a finer weave to the fibers. The set made in China had a ""diamond"" weave to the fabric, and were much rougher on the skin. Everything else about the sets were identical - same sizes, same construction - just completely different textiles used to construct them.I'm returning the China made sheets and ordering another set in hopes for a made in india set, which are fantastic."
3,below average,"This set of sheets is below average for the thread count claimed. It is a struggle to get it on the mattress, too tight. It also is not soft as a high thread count should be."
3,colour is off,"i have not yet used the ""cafe"" colour Queen set yet, but the ""cafe"" colour is distinctly unlike what i see on the colour chart. It is not the colour of coffee but more like the yellowy-brown of the ""Add to Cart"" button on the ordering page; distinctly, undeniably yellow-ochre, not the least bit chocolaty, earthy or coffee brown. Not a big problem at all, just unexpected. The fabric is certainly soft and i'm sure it will become even softer as most 100% cotton products do, with use. (NOT Egyptian cotton as tagged on this site, label is clear: made in India....)"
1,Great cloth but too small for a a queen matress,I was pleasantly surprised with the speed at which it was delivered. Feels very soft and thick.The only disadvantage and it makes the set useless for us is that the fitted sheet is a couple of inches smaller than the standard queen size mattress. So I wouldn't buy this again nor would I recommend it to anyone.
5,Excellent purchase,"Renaissance 600-Thread-Count Solid Queen Sheet Set, CaféI was really pleasantly surprised with the quality of this product. I have bought many king sized sheet sets where I paid over $100 for the set and none were of this great quality. In fact, I've used it, washed it and put it back on because I loved the feel of it.Keep up the good work with quality products."
3,Color nothing like advertised,"I bought this set in Wt. Blue (Water Blue) thinking that it was a fairly dark blue color that resembled a sheet set I already own. At least that is what the picture on the website led me to believe. The color of the sheet set that actually arrived, labeled Wt. Blue, was more of an extremely light baby blue color. The actual color is nice, just not what I was expecting or hoping for."
3,Spend a little more for better quality,"Having spent $70-$120 in the past for 600+ thread count sheet sets these seemed to be a bargain. When I received them they had a rich color, two pillow cases, and pockets deep enough for my 18"" mattress. However, most note worthy was the rather coarse texture of the set. After repeated washings not only did the color fade slightly but, they have yet to get any softer. That said some may still have a use for such a set. I do believe this set to be more durable than its lower thread count rivals which cost about the same. So, send them off with a college student or use them as a house warming gift."
4,It's very soft,"I recently purchased the renaissance 600 count. It's very soft and comfy, but, after washing wrinkles. The color I picked (cafe) matches almost my comforter. Overall, i am satisfied with this sheet."
1,So crisp they're crunchy,"The color was not at all what I expected, either from the picture or the word (Cafe) used to describe it; instead, the sheets were a light gold. Also, I expect sateen sheets to be smooth and silky, especially with this thread count, and these were stiff and uncomfortable. They actually crunch when you move around in them. This is the last time I buy something like this online; from now on, I'm not buying sheets unless I can see and feel them first."
1,Extremely disappointed,"For this price, I expected a pretty high end set of sheets...one that was fairly soft, and fit well. With these, I got neither. Not only do these feel ""cheap"" and thin, they're not soft at all, even after three washings. Additionally, although I ordered Queen size sheets and do not have an overly thick mattress, it almost took an act of Congress to get the final corner onto the mattress. I can tell just by this first experience that they aren't sized properly, and that after a few uses, the elastic is going to be complete stretched out. Do yourself a favor and don't buy these. Go to Target and get their 600-count Egyptian sheets...which is what I wish I had done to begin with."
2,not so great...,I've been using 600+ count sheets now for over 7 years and I ordered these considering the many positive reviews. I ordered King and I have to say that they are rough not soft! They are not comfortable at all. I am going to wash them a few more times and hopefully they get softer the more I wear them in.
1,Sheets,"I was not happy with the color of these sheets. The quality was also questionable. When I washed these sheets, the color faded and they became very wrinkly and messy. All in all, I would say these were not my best purchase."
4,Great Sheets,"The sheets arrived promptly, the color is right on and they couldn't be more comfortable. The only reason I gave them 4 Stars is because after washing them, we have used them only once.I will update review after a few more washings.1/08 Well, these are beautiful sheets and sooo soft. We bought these for our house in the mountains and they have been great sheets and were very comfortable into late fall. We look forward to using them again when it gets warmer."
1,mismatched,"The Sheets I recieved were missized. I ordered the King Set. When they arrived i took them out, washed and dried them and proceeded to make up my bed only to discover that the fitted sheet was a Queen!!!!!!!!"
3,Definitely not teal,"The sheets I received were quality sheets as advertised. They were, however, not teal. The first set I received was a light grey without a hint of blue or green. The replacement set I recieved were a slightly darker grey, again without a trace of blue or green.Amizon was very cooperative in dealing with the returns, and I finally settle on a set of ivory sheets, that I am quite satisfied with.t"
2,Cafe is GOLD,"I ordered this set for my king sized bed and cafe (which is coffee in French) turns out to be a gold/yellow color. The the photo on the site it looks more like a taupe but I was wrong. Even my husband asked why I bought ""gold"" sheets to go with our brown/blue comforter set (which does not go at all). I still ended up keeping this set as we only ordered one set of sheets for our new bed so far. The sheets feel soft and I have no complaints there other then the color is totally off. If I order another set it will be the dark brown set."
