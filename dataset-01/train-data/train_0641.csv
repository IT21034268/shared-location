3,It's Just OK,"I think my daughter enjoyed the fact that it was Dora. It wouldn't matter what it was. Boots floats upside down. I thought he would actually squirt water, but he is no different than any other squirt bath toy. The life jacket changes colors in the water. It is nice that Dora's hair is plastic. My 2 1/2 yr old plays with Dora occasionally, but prefers more of the wind up toys in the tub."
3,Fair Basic Tang Soo Do Book...,"This was one of the first economical Tang Soo Do books, first published in 1980. Author Henry Murphy offers the basic philosophy and techniques to 7th gup (orange belt) in Moo Duk Kwan style of Tang Soo Do. The information here is both basic and brief. You will not find much on history, and there is only one picture of Grandmaster Hwang Kee standing with C.I. Kim. For the beginner, this is a nice little volume, focused as it is on the foundations of the art. The three hyung included in this book are the Ki Cho Hyung Il Bu (first), Ee Bu (second), and Sam Bu (third). The tenents of Tang Soo Do, philosophy, et cetera. for a more thorough volume on this specific style, try Kang Uk Lee's ""Tang Soo Do"". If you're afraid you'll skip ahead and want to stay focused on the fundamentals, this book is perfect."
4,Good Book!,Good intro to this Korean Martial Art. Lots of illustrations on proper form. Basically a supplement to Mr. Murpy's instruction. I took his class ages ago and he gave it to the students for free. He is a great teacher. Don't know where he is and I wish I kept in contact with him.
4,In The Style Of Beautiful Thing,This is one of the better films I have seen in quite some time. The director chose to film with handheld cams which gave the film a more down to earth style. The actors were very believeable in their character portrayals. Perhaps the best two scenes in the movie that touched me the most was the scene when Jared talked with his blind charge informing her he was leaving and the final scene where Jared asked Robert for a date. This film was reminicent of Beautiful Thing. It explored the coming out of a young man and the conflicts he encounters with the gay lifestyle's good and bad subject matters. Make this film one of your must see films of the year!
3,You can TELL this one was done in five days,"Okay, first off, I DID enjoy this movie. No, REALLY. It was fun, for what it was worth.But yeah, it was pretty clear this movie was done in a really short time. It's not as polished as it could be. The plot line wasn't terribly compelling. The acting was decidedly amateurish.The only saving grace for this movie was the old blind woman (whose name I forget) who actually had the strength to do something beyond just bending to the whims of other people. As a blind person, she was the one person who could see past all the...in everyone's lives.Rent this movie. Really."
4,A Thoroughly Charming Film,"This amazing little film was shot in six days on a $30,000 budget. That's right: a three and four (not five) zeroes. This is proof that good films can be made on a non-existant budget if the people involved care enough about the project to work 25-hour days. This is real guerilla filmmaking: the location shots were obviously done on the sly. Also, it is great to see a film by gay people about gay people that is as sweet-natured as this one is."
3,A nice surprise,"I can agree with some of what the previous reviewer stated because I had a difficult time getting into this story. It's a coming out story of a guy who comes to California from Georgia, and while at a youth hostel, he kisses a guy for the first time. He's a little freaked, but Jared does know it's what he wants, but it's not until he's working for a blind lady, and her son seduces him, that Jared discovers himself. Although this relationship dissolves into the fantasy it is, Jared does track down the guy from the youth hostel in hopes of finding happiness. It's a surprisingly intelligent story that gets better as it goes along. Certainly a welcome debut that tells a classic story in a rather fresh perspective, with some poignant moments."
5,One of the best fimls out there! ^__^,"This is a beautiful movie! I watched it while I was eating dinner and my heart waas moved from the beginning to the end, when you could just definently see Jared and his boyfriend. Just the way Jared and his boyfriend were looking at each other I loved justw atching them, with the love in their eyes! I definently recommend this movie to anyone! It's beautiful! The adventure was something that I enjoyed watching him go through because even though he was broken and scared at times... he healed quickly and leaped for his dreams when he realized it was in front of him! :DDefinently a MUST SEE! I recomment it you won't be dissapointed! :D I rented it and I loved it!"
3,A journey worth taking.,"This was a terrific movie. The story line was quite believable, and the raw aspect of being shot with a hand held camera added to the overall effect. (Especially since Jared carried his camera with him wherever he went.) Corey Spears as Jared did an excellent job. His beautiful southern drawl and quiet reflective nature made his character likeable and believable. Most of the acting was top notch. Though at times some of the supporting characters appeared to be reciting their lines instead of acting them."
2,Sofa Watch With The BF,"Corey Spears is just so clunkily cute you'll want to cuddle him up, forgive him anything and probably watch this twice. He can't act (no one in this flick can), but he's got a goofy, adorable quality about him.The Journey of Jared Price is as low budget as low budget can be (figure a total cost of about 50 bucks) and looks like it was shot in a couple of afternoons after film class. The acting is terrible (Rocki Craig wins the award for Most Stilted Actress in a Supporting Role), the story is about the oldest gimmick in the book and it's meant to pluck at your heartstrings. Production values? Hey, in this world, anyone can get the equipment at Best Buy for a few hundred bucks, and it shows. Still, it makes you want to cuddle up with your boyfriend and have a good sigh. It's schlock, but doubtless makes big bucks on the direct-to-DVD-market because it's bad enough to be cute."
3,Journey of Jared Price,"This is pretty decent for a independent film. Ok, so sme of the acting isn't the best and you get the feeling that they had a low budget and had to let a few mistakes go through the works, but the sory isn't that bad and the guy that plays the young teen in love with Jared is a pretty decent actor. Some of the love scenes are a bit racey (due to subject matter) but tasteful. Over all it's a good little story. I'd like to see more from this director and some of his cast. See what else they can do."
5,If you want to play it like he does...,"The tablature in this book is very accurate. If you want to play it exactly like the CD, this is the book for you. While it is true that Jack Johnson's songs are pretty easy to figure out, it is worth my $15 so I can be 100% accurate. I really want the little details of the solos and fills that are included in the book. Hey, I'm a perfectionist with my guitar playing :)"
2,ok for the price,"while this works as well as any other type of antennae, please be aware the UHF part is stationary...and the VHF ""wands"" ONLY move up and down from side to side - NOT front and back as you would think it would. i learned my lesson as one antenna broke off right at the base as i tried to get it to do what it wasn't intended to do i.e. move forward. it is an ok product for that OTHER TV you have in the den or guest bedroom... (this may all be moot anyway come Feb 2009 with the new law taking effect)"
5,A great game,"FIFA 2003 is by far the best game in the FIFA franchise. As soon as I heard about it coming out I couldn't wait. I wasn't dissatisfied. The graphics are GREAT and the controls, although they take a little bit of time to get used to, are smooth. Also, the player detail is amazing! I am a fan of the German club Schalke 04 and in addition to having it in the game I could recognize several of the players right away just looking at their faces! Another plus is the game has the UEFA cup and Champions League competions in it, although they are under different names. This is a big bonus feature. And with over 400 teams in the game this is the best soccer game out there. I would reccomend this game to anybody who wants a fun, exciting, realistic soccer gaming experience."
4,Pet Stepping Stone,I love this idea and the stepping stone kit comes with numerous accessories to decorate. I believe it will make a perfect gift. Very satisfied.
1,Not worth buying in 2012...,"This game is basically the original gauntlet, it has nothing to do with the revamped versions for the PSone and N64, which is kind of what I was hoping for. Your character moves at a pace too slow to allow anything to actually happen. The controls are sloppy, and aiming is impossible. I'm sure this would have been worth playing at one time, but now it's garbage, and that's where I'll be putting mine."
4,Not bad,"I realize this is a dated game for a dated system but good games never die. I keep my GBA in my locker at work and take it out during breaks or down time of nothing much happening. While this game is not as good as Gauntlet Dark Legacy or Legends it's still a fun game in it's own right. It would be nice to have a multiplyer option but as I said earlier I pretty much play this while at work and I'm the only guy who has one so single player works just fine for me. So it's fun and helps pass the time at work, I like it."
2,BORING!,"While I expected a flashback to the coin-op days, I got only a poor imitation. The audio is horrible, and the game play (though the controls are easy) is just plain SLOW. Compared to other games' features, this game is seriously lacking -- no mapping, difficult navigation (given the psuedo-3D of the worlds you traverse), and finally, after spending time looking for and collecting gold, there is NO REASON TO DO SO! Gold means nothing! AAAGGGHHH.I was also looking forward to the audio telling me things like ""Red Warrior needs food badly,"" but in reality, this game is ""about to die."""
3,Stained and curled after 1 yr,"This mat was fine for the short term, but began to get stains/rings from our dog's stainless steel bowl after about 10 months-1 year. We needed to replace it. The edges also curled after we put it in the dishwasher (probably should not have done that.. ).What you can't tell from the picture is that it has an outline of a goofy dog picture and dinner within the mat. It is like a raised line drawing. Can't see it much when the bowls are on it. It is also not pearlized... just plain gray plastic."
5,Wonderful Praises to the Lord,"Let me begin by saying that I am a biased consumer of this product because I am a member of Windsor Village and of the choir. HOWEVER, I enjoy GOOD Gospel music and I am able to be a little unbiased of our project. I would like to say to anyone thinking of buying this CD/album, that we at The Village take praising God very seriously and we want to bring the message to the world! Our Pastor is an excellent teacher, preacher, community leader and he has inspired us to believe that we CAN DO ALL things through Christ who strengthens us. This album is the culmination of a lot of hard work but we want only to spread the love of Jesus and bring salvation to those who don't know the Lord. Please buy our product and enjoy worshipping with us - - - WELCOME TO THE VILLAGE!"
3,Solid,"The album starts off with a beautiful rendition of ""Psalms 150"" and continues into the catchy, ""Lord, I Want to Know You"" and the encouraging, ""Deliverance Is Available To You"". Other standouts include; ""Holy Is His Name"", which features lead vocals by Daryl Coley. It's an okay Daryl Coley guest spot, it's no 'When Sunday Comes' (from Donald Lawrence & the Tri-City Singers 'Bible Stories' album) or 'Guide Me O Thou Great Jehovah' (from Here II Praise's 'Giving You Nothing But Praise' album), but it's aight. There's also the upbeat ""Yes I Can"", the title track ""Welcome To The Village"". Then the album takes a more patriotic turn, finishing out with ""God Bless America"" and ""The Star-Spangled Banner""; altogether a solid project."
1,Do Not Buy! Very Dangerous!,"Please do not buy this toy! It is fun and the cat loves it very much! But it will tangle and will choke the kitty. If I wasn't home, my kitten would've choked because it got warped around his neck! Because it is a string, it will tighten itself and the more kitty struggles to get it off the more pressure is places on the tangled body part! Please spare your kitty's life and do not buy this! I cut the string off right there and then and threw it out! Be very cautious with this and do not let the kitty play with it alone!"
3,"Good idea, not very durable","I had a friend who had a similar toy for her cats. I found this (and a similar one) on Amazon and ordered 2 for my 2 cats. They absolutely LOVED them, but I'm pretty sure they didn't last more than a couple days each. Sometimes, the cats were able to pull so hard that it would come off the door jam, which I didn't mind. But after ~2 days use, they were able to rip the actual toy away from the bungee cord. Perhaps my cats just play too hard?Bottom line: great idea, my cats absolutely loved them, but they just weren't durable enough for my ferocious felines!"
4,Longer string for my fat and lazy cat,"Great toy. Quality is very high. Very pleased. It stays on the door frame securely and also works around chairs and stools (alternative locations for my cat to play). However, with the height of the doorframes in my place, the mouse barely grazes the top of him when he walks underneath it ignoring the temptation to play with it. When I pull the elasticized string (which is great) and get the mouse down to the ground so my lazy kitty sees it, the toy entertains him and gets him moving. If the string were longer my cat might play with the toy by himself (like he does with toys that are on the floor)."
2,Good bathroom reader,"While this book is nicely written, photographed and art directed, as a working reference manual for specific plants for specific locales such as the Southwest Desert (or any where else for that matter)it isn't of much value. The Sunset Western Garden Book is far superior. It gives a much better climate zone break down and a much more complete and usable plant guide for the gardener."
2,Great while they lasted,"I purchased a set of egrips fro my iPhone and they worked as advertised. The phone would not slide off of anything and was very easy to grip. However, the rubber delaminated from the adhesive backing pad after about 3 weeks so all that was left on the phone was a shiny plastic strip."
5,WOW,"If you have never heard of this band, you are really missing out. A friend recommended them to me and they have quickly become one of my favorites. They have a catchy yet unique sound, and lyrics that will knock your socks off; most defiantly worth a small investment to make a new musical best friend. Other really good albums are Satisfiction and Dave Lowensohn Dates Your Daughter. Or you can check out some free online music off their website: www.speechwritersllc.comBy the way, I just realized after writing this that I sound like I work for the band...I don't.Cheers!Mike"
5,indendiary,"ive been listening to these guys since 2001, when satisfiction came out. their lyrical abiltity shocks me, and no matter what mood im in, i can always find a reason to listen to speechwriters. this album opens up with some remakes of some of their earlier projects, and has 4 spankin new tracks. Or Something can bring anyone to their knees wishing for old relationships to come back into their lives and Hostage is a song about not quite getting what, or who, you need. dave signed a copy for me when my cousin went to one of their shows this summer. these guys are hardworking amazing artists, and this album really proves it."
1,Total Piece of Junk,"This thing is not even worth 5 bucks, much less what I paid. I noticed that an orange dye rubbed off on my hands when I took it out of the box, but that was nothing compared to what happened next, it bled like an orange stuck pig, all over my marble floor !! I looked at the piece of paper that came with it, and it said not to get it wet, or put it on carpet. REALLY ?! A bathroom shelf that you can't get wet AT ALL, not even an accidental splash, or it will bleed like a stuck pig ?? The enclosed paper said I could use a small rug under it,if I wanted to use it on a carpet. Again, REALLY ?! So, who out there wants to ruin their rugs with orange dye ?? I decided to test it, to see just how bad it would bleed. Well, I had it in a hot shower for an hour, and then in a filled tub with soap for another hour. It still bled. Oh, and just FYI, it's mostly made of PAPER. The description of the product that came in the box said so. Save your money, this is a total rip-off."
1,"Don't bother, very disappointing!","I bought this to save counter space in our bathroom. The color is not very accurate, it has a cheap looking orange tint to it. I could live with that, or paint it. However, when we placed it on the floor in our bathroom it was very unsteady and wobbly! I couldn't put my basket of toiletries on it and feel at all confident that it wouldn't tip with the slightest touch. Will be returning and ordering a better one."
4,Love it,This is great for the space in my bathroom. No assembly required. It's just the right size for a small space. I love it.
4,cute,"Product is as stated, cute, sturdy, and right for small spaces. Only thing was the color...pic doesn't show true color on the shelves."
2,Not what I expected...,"This is a mini shotgun microphone. The sound it captures is directional and monaural. You can switch from zoom/off/gun.Switched to ""zoom"" it does not amplify distant sounds, as the ""zoom"" implies, but merely narrows (or focuses) on the sound source. Unfortunately, majority of the sound is still picked up by the built-in mic.On ""off"", all the sound is captured by the built-in mic.When switched to ""gun"", it becomes a directional (or typical) shotgun mic, but the main sound source is still from the built-in mic on the camcorder.The ECMHS1 uses Sony's intelligent accessory shoe. There are no cable connectors on this mic, so I'm assuming, this mic will only work on Sony camcorders (I have a Sony DCR-PC101). I've returned this item.If you are looking for a good (professional) shotgun microphone that will work with most camcorders, I would recommend the Sennheiser MKE-300."
1,Misleading info,"The write up says 'intelligent accessory shoe'. It would have to be super intelligent to fit most shoes. I assume it does fit some one model of Sony. It will not fit any Canon for sure - because the contacts are at the wrong end. So, though it says it will fit any intelligent shoe, that is not quite right.I also could not get it to swivel, as the pciture says it can."
2,did not work,It does seem to be solid construction however the wire bristols were too thick for the brush to work on my heil ac unit. I will either try to make a similar brush with piano wire or I'll use something small like a tiny flathead screwdriver and work on each blade individually.
2,Not good at all...,"Whiteout is not good at all. Konami really had a lot of pontential here, it could have been great... The trick system is based off of SSX, using the shoulder buttons to pull tricks. It is not very responsive, and the tricks are incredibly tame. The racing is average at best, but it won't really hold your interest. Objectives in each course feel forced, and usually don't blend in..."
2,Great look but low on quality,"We live in the southwest and I love the rustic look of the Taos flatware set. However, beyond the look there is not a lot of quality behind the design. The forks are what I dislike most because the ends of the tines are so thick and poorly crafted you can't stab a piece of lettuce to save your life. Also, the ""stainless"" part must be a thin veneer, since a couple of pieces have nicks through the outer layer (and keep in mind this is a new set) and that inner layer will lay a rust stain over the bottom of the sink in a short amount of time. All that said, I keep it for everyday use but wash it by hand."
3,"But... This is a PAL release, Region 4, Unplayable in America",This DVD has not been properly released in America as a Region 1 DVD so don't buy this unless you plan on viewing it in Europe!!!
5,A must for Shirey collectors,This is a must have for all Shirley collectors or just Shirley fans. Very informative and very impressive.
5,doll amateurs view,I was attracted by the books cover at first and was delighted to find that it was well layed out. Details seem to be relevant. Visually delightful. Interesting to see so many beautiful and unusual dolls attributed to a such a talented person. Author shows great enthusiasm for the subject. Truely a must have for any real Shirley Temple fan !
2,ENTER THE TEMPLE IF YOU WORSHIP GODDESS SHIRLEY,"Everyone's favorite curly-haired moppet is also quite the collectible kid. Temple fan and collector Suzanne Kraus-Mancuso has complied two volumes that identify and help set value to sundry Shirley goodies, including posters, autographs, dolls and records. The 300 color photographs are fascinating --- Shirley's image on a series of vintage 1930s Italian cigar bands, a reproduction of her 1936 life insurance policy (she was 8; the amount was $300,000), even the obituary of her first hubby, actor John Agar --- make up for Kraus-Mancuso's weak poor and writing style. Enter the Temple if you worship theGoddess Shirley."
2,Sorry,"I'm sorry but I didn't find this book that compelling. The prose is clearly beautifully written, but I had to force myself to finish it. I loved the stuff about silkworms and the early stuff about the queen, but after that I found it hard to take any interest in the characters."
2,Muddled plot line takes away from fascinating concept,"I don't think I've ever suggested a book be longer but this needed a good 100 pages more to make sense. Certainly the concept was a fascinating one. The Spanish Inquisition and its effects on both the common peasant and royalty is intriguing, but the author seemed to be so caught up in ""painting a picture"" that the writing seemed affected not to mention the numerous plot lines left dangling in the wind. Why didn't the two women's lives intersect a bit more? The writer couldn't decide if she was writing a novel or a Harlequin romance, leaving a dissatisfied reader in the end."
2,Couldn't wait to finish it,"It was a mission to finish this book because at times I was disgusted with it. I have read other reviewers comment on the excess of bodily fluids . . . Were these too crude for a lover of historical fiction? Perhaps . . . The information on the Spanish monarchy, the Inquisition and even the French Court was rich in images, but when I pick up a book I want more. Reading a book is like watching a movie. You want a good plot, you want to expand your knowledge of a particular era, you want to appreciate the characters, but you also want to be entertained. This time it failed for me."
2,"Superlatives in many reviews, but what's the point?","The synopses present the story well. However, after reading the book, I felt cheated. ""Poison"" is no more than a high-brow romance novel which attempts to chronicle parallels in two women's lives..the princess and the pauper. Guess who has the bette sex life? But the two really have nothing more in common than you or I, nor do their lives intersect in any meaningful manner. So now I know a little bit more about silk worm farming. What was the point of being dragged into these two lives? I finished the book, but will likely not pursue any more work by this author. Sorry."
2,couldn't wait to get through it,"I had high hopes for this book... especially after reading a lot of positive reviews. I generally like books about women from different periods of time (Crimson Petal and the White, the Dress Lodger, Slammerkin). However, I found this book tedious. In the future, whenever I hear a lot of people talking about the ""beautiful, poetic language"" - i'm taking it for what it is. Flowery, and sometimes over-descriptive account of the story. This book had the makings of a lot going for it - 2 women's lives parralled in tenuous situations but it fell flat for me and I think it was partly because of the language and partly because I could not get into the characters as much as I wanted to. I don't want to read about a person's dreams more than what is really happening in the story. I like stories that are more straight-forward and unflinching."
3,missing ODBC codes,With out side help you may pass the IIS test but not on this book alone. Nothing on error codes and the test does cover this. Good graphs and pictures to help understand.
5,Good book for IIS4 test,"I passed the IIS4 test with an 827 last week and this book really helped my understanding of IIS4 and making it work! This book coupled with Transcender, braindumps, and Microsoft's ODBC error code printouts from MS web site helped me learn the material and pass the test. Download the PC Age demo test as well.Good luck."
5,An Excellent Resource,"I am a Web Developer who must wear many hats - including IIS Administration on occasion. This book gives precise focus on what you need to do for each task, with a clear explanation of the options available."
3,Good Book but it contains a few errors.,"Good book overall but it does contain a few errors, specially in the code... Worth the buy though and hopefully the author will post a corrigendum to a web-site."
4,A Must have book for IIS4,"Great book for Administration and Trouble-shooting. Also, a great source for finding the ""how-to"" on all of custom IIS issues. The Security Chapter is also great for the IIS4 test. A must have for day to day trouble shooting and configuration."
5,Well written. The answers I was looking for.,"After searching through more than a dozen books on IIS4, I found this one. It answered everything I neeed to know about Index server and I will enjoy going through it to learn more about the other aspects of IIS4 that I must implement in a small office environment. Kudos to the author. Well put together."
5,Superb book on Internet Information Server,Thank you Mitch Tulloch for writing this book. I like the style and presentation of topics. Very clear. Excellent table of contents. An overall superb book.
5,This is very nice work.,"As a webmaster familiar with the UNIX side of doing things, I had to get up to speed with NT and IIS 4.0. This book is definintely one of the best ones out there. I like books that explain what's going on in the background as well as examples to guide me on specific tasks. I would recommend this book."
5,"Awesome, just plain awesome",I was able to install and configure the NT Option Pack in about 2 days with the help of this book. AWESOME... just plain awesome! This is a must-have book for NT Admins.
5,For some sensibilities only,"I highly recommend this movie: it's powerful, devastating and terribly realistic. However, BE CAREFUL, SENSITIVE VIEWERS!: its images may shockingly hurt you. It's a fierce drama that may become extremely violent to some sensibilities since it deals with kids in a state of war. If you think you can cope with the subject, go ahead, don't miss it. However, if you suffer with images of suffering children, skip it."
4,Heartbreaking film,"One of the best films I have seen: captures the lack of humanity and humanity of this world simaltaneously. Humanises conflict. Has the ability to make you laugh and cry. Draws attention to the plight of children and humanises the children of the Middle East. I would recommend this film to everyone with a conscience as essential viewing. Having said that, it did plunge me into depression so perhaps I should urge caution."
5,Love love love,Interesting treatise on how to love unconditionally. It had an immediate effect on the way that I perceived love and the place that my loved ones hold in my life.
2,It does come with a list of compatible batteries,"I have only the retail package and the three adapters I got at a garage sale. Note that the package DOES LIST 96 compatible batteries (I'll try to attach a picure of the list) and each adapter plate lists the batteries they are used for (I'll try to attach pictures of those, too.)Note that I also have a slightly different model charger by the same manufaturer, but branded TARGUS TG-LCUV, also available through AmazonTargus TG-LCUV Universal Li-Ion Charger, that uses the exact same three adapter plates, plus one more that it needs.I haven't used it yet, so I can't say how good it is."
2,Puff Piece,"Decent corporate bio, but definitely in the ""authorized"" category. Corporate missteps and blunders are glossed over, and the company is portrayed as having created everything. For example, did McDonald's really create centralized distribution? Was the creative accounting used to obtain financing in the 1960s OK since they didn't default on the loans, and it's more accepted today? Should the rage and childishness of Ray Kroc and later CEO Fred Turner exhibited at times be overlooked so easily? The book paints an extremely rosy picture of a company that is extremely flawed.Interesting chronology and interpretation of the development of this monolithic American icon. Could have been more balanced and investigative, and relied less the corporate archives."
5,Love Rutter!,I sing in my church choir and our musical director is a big Rutter fan. I wasn't at first but have learned to love his music. This Christmas CD has not let me down and this Christmas we will be singing a lot of Rutter at our Holiday Concert.
3,Beautiful,"I've two of the John Rutter cds: Be Thou My Vision and The John Rutter Christmas Album. Both contain beautiful arrangements and incredible singing. I'd give them both 5 stars but I find that I cannot always understand the women's parts. It's probably a lack in my own hearing range since the lower voices of the men are clear and easy to understand. I think for most people, this perceived fault would not be an issue. On the plus side, the CD includes a copy of the words for each song."
5,Christmas just came to my apartment,"Christmas has come a bit early to my little apartment. Tonight I purchased The John Rutter Christmas Album. I'm listening to it on my laptop right now...How amazing, delicate and worshipful this music is. Exquisite voices, perfectly balanced and harmonized by Rutter's arrangements.There are so many favorites on this album. One delight is the Donkey Carol. It is written in an unever 5/8 time, so you have the feeling of being carried on a clumsy donkey!Another is I Saw Three Ships. Very light and happy, with a key change that is like the opening of a flower. How Rutter does it, I can only marvel. ""And he did whistle, and she did sing on Christmas Day in the morning!""This is a perfect album to get you in the mood for Christmas. Light a few candles, turn down the lights, and put on this collection of music. There are 23 tracks, so you get a very good value. (Many of these have been published on earlier albums.)"
2,a little disappointed,"I am so spoiled by cookbooks with photos of the recipes I was disappointed. There are many useful recipes and good information, but I haven't tried one yet.. I was hoping to be wowed by some new ideas. So maybe if you are new to healthful cooking it would be more interesting. I can't get excited about this cookbook, and I think it is overpriced."
2,"Good Organization, Awful Cookbook","There are a lot of great whole foods cookbooks out there. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. It does have lots of great information in it, but the recipes have consistently been disappointments. I've tried it time and time again over the past three years and have only had one recipe win ""approval"" from my family."
5,Exactly as Ordered,"Great product, great price. Best tapes I've used for my Sony camera. Highly recommend for any mini-dv tape camera user."
5,Perfect for birthday parties or for just anytime....,"Seeing that no one else has given a review to this album yet, I decided that it should be reviewed. Sharon, Lois & Bram produced an excellent album here... Full of songs for birthday parties, but also for just any old time when it is raining outside and you can't get the kids outdoors. The are enough songs on this album that they do NOT wear on you and both parents and kids enjoy this album. The CD of this is hard to find, so keep your eye open for it! I would highly recommend this for a birthday present... Great album!(this album was later released as Elephant Party)"
2,Freaky Flyers,"Freaky Flyers is an airplane racing game with a cartoon like feel, that sounded good to me so I bought it, however the game moves at an extremely slow speed, it almost feels like your airplane is staying still and the enviroment is moving. Also you must beat levels to unlock characters and new tracks; Lame."
3,Disappointed,"I got the Uncle Mike's Large Pistol case for use in my Uncle Mike's Deluxe Range Bag which I love. Unfortunately the large case is not shaped like the picture and is very long and won't fit in the outside pocket like I was looking for. It is good quality, but the picture is misleading. I wish they would have included the dimensions and accurate picture."
5,A Cost Effective Soft Handgun Case,Uncle Mike's offers good quality and excellent price-value. Great case for storage and transport to and from gun range.
3,Has A Fan,"This amp has a cooling fan, unlike the Alesis amp I was replacing. Fans make noise, and noise is bad."
5,all-in-one resource for parents of young children,"This is a wonderful book for parents of young children. It starts out with year-by-year chapters on the developmental changes for one to five-year-olds. Then it goes on to chapters on specific problems of young childhood, such as toileting or grieving or moving away. These chapters include quotes and ideas from many authorities and writers on parenting. I would always wonder, looking at a book by one author, whether one person could have all the right answers for parents' problems. This book gives you the best of many ideas, plus lists of books and resources, should you need more help on any problem. But it isn't just about problems. There are descriptions of projects and games to do with the kids, too. It would make a great baby shower gift or a gift for a parent on a child's first birthday."
4,good deal!,TDK miniDV tapes at amazon is good deal. this price is worthy to buying also it is free shipping. TDK is a fomous brand especially on vidio and audio tape. The making of this tape is really fine.
1,Misleading again.,DVM DV Cassettes shown on Amazon. Digital Standard DV Cassettes received and returned. I am not pleased as according to a 2006 review this was happening then. It should have been fixed by now.
4,"Good quality, good price!",That about sums up what you need in a MiniDV tape. And don't forget Amazon's amazingly quick delivery on these types of accessories.
2,Misleading Image,The image they are showing on the site and the product you get are different. It says DVM and I got DVC. I dont know the difference. I didnt use the product yet but I am hopeful that I would not get disappointed.
5,"They're just mini DV tapes, buy em already!","Whattya wanna know? They're tapes, they're priced well and they work in your mini-dv camcorder. Stop reading all these posts and buy em already!Only 7 of 32 of you found that helpful?????? Where's your sense of humor people!!! Come on, proceed to checkout!"
3,Does it support 90 minute recording mode?,Some tapes can be used at SP for 60 minutes and LP for 90 minutes. What about this one?
5,Excellent quality at a fair price,If you have a digital camcorder you'll need lots of tape. The new camcorders are so easy to use and small enough to take anywhere that you must remember to carry extra tapes. These tapes are also small enough to allow you to easily carry additional tapes. TDK always makes a reliable product and these tapes are another good example of TDK quality. I've used the same tape again and again with no obvious degradation of quality. My video (with an inexpensive camcorder) is clear and crisp. The tapes that I use repeatedly are holding up fine. Overall I'm really pleased.
4,TDK Mini dvd tapes,I shopped around elsewhere and typical cost is twenty bucks. I had purchased a good quality Sony tape 3pk for twenty bucks in Best buy
1,Amatuer authoring,"The program won't do motion menus, and it tells you when you start up that it wants to run with only a few colors instead of normal resolution so you know that it isn't very advanced. Then I have tried several different hardware configurations and I am using XP with several different codec settings and the dumb program keeps crashing, I'm not really into updating into the beta versions of software but I think you going to have to in order to get your moneys worth out of this program. I have gotten it to work with really common compression settings like Microsft DV AVI but nothing else though and really small movies, not large ones. I'd say it's more like $10 rather than $500."
4,Hard to put down!,"I've had this book for several years and I'm finally getting around to reviewing it. My only complaint is that the major characters of previous books aren't present much, but that's because Sky left home after being falsely accused of killing the young woman he loved.Although it's not likely, I would love to see another book where Billy Yates, town-bully-turned-minister, makes peace with his hostile father."
3,nice,"they are really nice in the snow, a little heavy for driving and a little stiff for walking but i didn't get the chance to wear them all that much so maybe as they get worn they'll loosen up."
3,Warm boots but difficult to get in and out of,Lovely warm boots and comfortable when they're on. The difficulty is getting them on and off again! Very small opening gives my son huge difficulties getting in and out of these boots.
2,I wish they were useful,"These look great. I've ordered Sorels for my kids now twice. Both times I had to send them back because they cannot get their feet into them. My 5 year old is skinny with 'normal' feet. Even if I push, shove and twist his foot, I cannot get them on in a size that is probably 1/2 to a size too big. I just don't get it. My 3 year old was the same story.I tried them again just in case the first time was a fluke, and because they LOOK so perfect...waterproof and warm with good tread. But back they went. Sigh."
4,Sorel Yoot Pac,great product. Amazon is great...boots fit snug to size. Overall a great kids boots for the winter. Ensure you size your kids feet well with some extra room allowance.
1,Can't even get feet in these,"I have the same problem one of the other reviewers mentioned: the top of the boot is so narrow that there is NO WAY my daughter can get her foot and leg into the opening. We have tried loosening the ties as far as they go, taking the lining out completely, etc. Nothing works. This might not be an issue with the bigger sizes, but beware of trying to buy these boots for a 3-4 year old.It's such a shame because the boots are cute and very sturdy; they would probably be excellent in cold weather.I live overseas so the hassle of returning these is enormous. *sigh*"
3,Soup OK.....Packaging gets a zero!,"It's not the tastiest soup ever but it is fast and filling. No complaints there, I know what I'm getting.BUT,very unusual for Amazon, the packaging leaves a LOT to be desired. I get it via Subscribe and Save and this last order came in a carton with other things. The CANNED GOODS included were very carefully packaged and protected......while the soup was placed in the carton with no packaging other than the stretch plastic which forms the ""six pack,"" it's sold as. In this shipment three of the paper cups were dented and one was broken and strewn allover the rest of the contents of the box. Made this shipment less than a bargain!Gave packaging feedback but again, not customary for Amazon, heard nothing. Haven't canceled my S&S; subscription yet but if it happens again, I certainly will."
5,Yummy!!,"This is the best instant soup ever!! I have even let my meat eating friends try this soup, and they all think it is fantastic. The soup has lots of flavor and lots of fiber. Wonderful for a quick, filling lunch."
4,Best Ever!,"This is the best, almost instant, black bean soup on the market! Very healthy and filling!"
1,Yuck,"Man, this soup is foul! It's not even the taste that's so bad--it tastes fairly ok, even though there's a slight cardboard aftertaste--it's the consistency which just makes it terrible. It's like some kind of sludge: no amount of mixing or altering the microwaving time/level does anything, believe me I tried. The reviewers who said it's filling are right: I swear I could feel the sludge in my stomach for the rest of the day. Do not buy this!"
3,"Seems nutritious enough, but getting my $ squeezed","My wife and I have been receiving this tasty soup on subscription, but now the price is 21% higher than my last order. I think I'll have to reconsider out of principle."
5,Wonderful wi Kashi Whole Grain crackers& a glass of red wine,"I've begun looking for really good, really healthy products on the Internet, especially through Amazon with its trustworthy customer reviews. This fits the bill and then some. It tastes great! I dip Kashi whole grain crackers into the soup and sip my one allotted daily glass of red wine. Am moderately disabled at 78. Live happily alone in my own home with plenty of attention and help from family and neighbors. But these kinds of products allow me to be my own caregiver. Much appreciated..."
3,I (only) Like My Oatmeal Lumpy...,"Not my soup. I can't find a good way for this soup not to be lumpy after adding the boiling water. I much prefer the split pea. It comes out with a good soup consistency for only a bit more on the price. But I haven't microwaved only added boiling water from the office coffee machine. So you'll have to try for yourself. Either way it's a good, all-natural product. Great soups in general from this brand, I just prefer the others."
1,It has MSG in it,"I was considering buying this product until I noticed it has MSG. ""Yeast Extract"" is another name for MSG for those that don't know. I don't necessarily have a problem with MSG. What I have a problem with is manufacturers using different names to conceal the fact that an ingredient is in the product.And just to play both sides, MSG is actually considered safe for 99% of the population according to several studies(please do your own research to confirm). However, I don't like being lied to, so this food is off my list."
1,Hidden MSG - sneaky!,"Yeast extract, one of the ingredients, is code for MSG. Go to truthinlabeling.com to get the low down on how it's legal for macdougalls to do this.Sneaky, but legal... Makes the entire macdougalls line suspect. They should be open about the addition of MSG. It makes many people sick. So depressing to see this in a ""health food"". This is why they can't advertise ""no MSG"" on the label or in their advertising... Get it?"
2,Not worth the price.,"I'd save your pennies here and pass on this one. For the taste, it's not worth the price. Also, you have to wait a while for it to cook all the way so what I did was dump it all into a pot and add boiling water... kind of defeats the purpose of the ""on-the-go"" part of the packaging."
2,Just My $.02,"What good is nutrition if your body is on the verge of puking? This is my first time eating Black Bean and Lime. I had tried Dr.McDougall's curry and Pad Thai; both are better tasting than this. BBL almost made me puke because of the taste, and some of the flavor blend didn't dissolve, rather it became a paste, a rather disgusting paste."
4,Good flavor in a vegan black bean soup!,"I like that the flavor is fresh and savory without any animal fat. Preparation is a little bit of a hassle because you really have to stir this stuff several times during cooking process, but there's no clean up."
5,Very good! (follow directions),"First, for this to be a good meal you should follow the directions. Stir well and let it sit after nuking the bowl.Second, this tastes great! Especially supplemented with some tortilla chips.So far I've had the McDougall's chicken ramen and the black bean soup. Black bean soup is better."
3,"Not impressed~ boring, & weak lime","I didn't really like this soup as I found it rather boring to eat. I mean, the lime flavoring was a good idea but it should have been a little more powerful you can only vaguely taste it in the soup if you concentrate. Overall, I dont think it had enough pizazz. I mean, if you like to eat plain beans you will like this but if not...-_-"
4,No Grains,"I don't eat grains and it's difficult to find quick to prepare cupped soup without cous cous, corn, rice, etc. I do physical work and need to keep my energy level up at all times at the office. These beans tastes great for something that's in a cup, and are easy to keep for emergencies in energy level. Love it."
4,healthy quick lunch,Better price on-line than at my local stores. Good to dip tortilla chips in after it sets a bit. Healthy high fiber soup for thoses that are into that sort of thing. Some of the packaging was banged up and I had to toss two containers of the soup.
3,Taste pretty good,"I read the reviews for the Black Bean & Lime soup and figured I would give it a try. I did not find the taste to be overpowering at all. In fact, I wish it had a little more flavor. I ate mine over some brown rice for lunch and then again over spanish rice for dinner. I think it taste very good that way. I did not like it just as a soup! So overall I gave it three stars because it wasn't flavorfull enough for me, but was still very tasty!"
5,GREAT!,"Much better than I expected! It tastes just like Panera Breads version but Im sure this one is much healthier. I love it and will not get tired of it any time soon. I will recommend this to everyone at work. Price is little more than I would like to pay but cheaper and more filling than a lean cuisine. Update: Months later still love this soup, Im doing the subscribe and pay and Im saving money so its cheaper than progresso or healthy choice and a whole lot more filling."
5,True Colors,"This is the finest Hofmann book I have seen.The combination of hue clarity, nuance, and sharp focus of the plates acurately recreates the space of the paintings and really lets them sing.The brush and knifework, even the weave of the canvases are all crystal clear in the reproductions.This solidly constructed book is a work of art in itself."
4,Honest account of Buteyko Clinic Method,"Easy, understandable and honest. Of the many books on this wonderful therapy, this contains the essence without any marketing ploys as contained in others. Do your searches and if you wish to regain control of your asthma or fatigue- this book cannot be missed."
3,"Book is Good, but Not as Described Above in Amazon's Description!","I am getting some benefit from this book. However, the new book I ordered from this Amazon page does not have the same table of contents as what is listed here in ""search in this book"". I was hoping to see chapter 4 on how to breath correctly while speaking, and in my book, chapter 4 is something else. The mention on how to breath correctly while speaking is not addressed at all in the book I received, and I feel very disappointed about this. It was one of the main reasons I chose this book over any of the others, was because of what I saw in the table of contents in the description. The book is good, but not what I had thought I was ordering. Maybe there were updated editions of the book and I got an older version? I don't know, but I ordered new so was expecting new."
5,Excellent Resource,This tiny little book delivers a big punch if you have any respiratory issues. Good information to have and use even if you don't.Patrick really knows what he is doing and these exercises really work. My children have really benefitted.
2,"Medical Information, Suggestions","Hmmmmm - despite the fact that there is a thread of truth regarding the efficacy of this better breathing concept, the process itself seems curious, at least with respect to several techniques described in the book. Still - if it works for some its a good thing."
4,2nd volume not up to 1st and skimpy,"I was totally blown away by film 1 : Dalai Lama Renaissance, so much so that i immediately ordered copies to give away to friends for birthdays/holidays.thus said, i couldn't wait for 2nd volume and ordered right away. i felt it didn't live up to the first, and was ""skimpy"", especially knowing that a 3rd !! is coming. i feel they cut and presented only part of the conference and then will sell another part and keep dribbling this out - and charging us $24 a pop! instead of being more generous and doing perhaps 2 vols together - it's not worth the full price frankly.still interesting, still insightful, but if the first volume was 25star, this is only about 13 [being generous]."
1,not worth it,"I bought the slipcover to avoid having to wash the entire boppy and wait for it to dry. It was a pointless purchase. If anything leaks onto the slipcover it goes right through to the Boppy anyway and you have to wash them both. Also, it is so thin my daughter's (3 months) little nails put a huge run it. For a little more than its cost, you could buy a new Boppy. I recommend buying 2 Boppys instead of the slipcover."
3,"Beautiful cover, but it's lacking something...","This pink cover truly is beautiful and very soft. But the fabric is too thin. I received a hand-me-down animal-printed Boppy Pillow and wanted to make it match my little girl's room. This certainly matches, but you can still see the animal print through the cover. I'm going to keep it, but I sure wish it didn't look so tacky!If you plan to use this cover, make sure you have a solid white Boppy pillow underneath."
4,OK-BUT YOU CAN SEE THROUGH IT,I RECEIVED THIS FOR MY BABY SHOWER. IT IS VERY SOFT AND WASHER FRIENDLY. I DO AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE YOUR BOPPY PILLOW PATTERN THROUGH IT THOUGH. I HAVE THE BOPPY YELLOW BEES PILLOW AND IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD WITH THE SLIPCOVER OVER IT. THE BEES ALMOST LOOK KIND OF PURPLE COLORED. A GREAT PRODUCT DEPENDING ON THE PATTERN YOUR PILLOW HAS ON IT.
2,Get what ya pay for,"I noticed a relief in wrist, knee pain. So that aspect worked. But the elastic string use to hold magnets together was of poor quality. You could actually see where the strings are tied together because of the extra string at end of the knot. Not ideal to wear if you are doing anything physical. Wrong bump and your string snaps."
5,awesome,this item came when expected and is wonderful...it is a little tight at first but stretches out over time. It really helps with my wrist and thumb joints a lot. I love it!!
3,Still waiting for releif,"I keep this bracelet on all the time. I am still waiting for releif from my arthristis pain. People comment on how nice it loods so it is attractive, but I don't have the releif I was hoping for"
1,Not as I thought,I had a concern about this bracelet. It did not feel comfortable and soothing and I stopped wearing it right away. Very disappointed
3,Looks good but not a magnet,"Looks good, smaller than many so good for men or women.The one I received has no magnetic force that I can tell. Maybe I got a dud?If the magnets worked (not that I believe in that magical power) I would have given it 1-2 more star(s)."
2,Too small to be so powerful,"The bracelet may be powerful but how would I know. I could just barely get it on. So I gave it to my wife to wear. She said she could wear it but was even a little tight on her.When I bought the bracelet, there was no size option. You should have a ""MAN's"" size bracelet!"
2,Too small,Was not big enough to fit my wrists. When I tried to take it off the string broke. String was not strong enough.
1,Powerful is NOT the word for this item,"The title of this item mentions that the magnets are powerful. Please don't buy this item if you are looking for powerful magnets as they are so weak they barely adhere to each other. They are some of the weakest magnets I have ever seen. Seller needs to change description and leave out the word ""powerful""."
2,too small,"The braclet did not fit on my wrist comfortably at all. It was too small. Because I couldn't wear it, I gave it to a femal friend of mine who liked it. It also did not fit her. Neither one of us are overweight, so I'm going to guess you have to be very petite for this to actually fit comfortable, or a child. Although it is a beautiful braclet. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"Attractive, but not effective","I find that the bracelet is very attractive, but was not very effective with respect to pain relief, at least not for me!"
3,meh,"the hematite looks fake, it's on elastic bands, I'm sure it will break soon. Wasn't too expensive though and not really worth the shipping to send it back"
2,Boyfriend likes it,"I bought this to replace my boyfriend's old, damaged magnet bracelet. He likes it fine, but it's definitely not made for his larger wrists -the beads are really spaced out by the time he puts it on.Edited 12/20/12 - bracelet fell apart the day after I posted the review - after less than 2 months of wear."
1,Not as expected,"While the bracelet is nice enough to look at and goes with most anything, I did not experience the pain relief I was seeking."
3,No relief,"Have not seen or felt the ""relief"" that I have felt with other bracelets. I feel nothing with this. ??"
4,Hematite Magnetic Sports Bracelet,"This Hematite Magnetic Sports Bracelet is great for Arthritis Back pain. It looks good, wears great and is water tolerant. This is a stretch bracelet, one size fits all."
1,Don't make the same mistake I did!,Product contains virtually NO magnets at all. It is of no use to someone seeking the health benefits of wearing magnets. Take my advice -- don't order this product.
3,a gift,I order this product for someone else. She stated it worked but not sure if it was in conjuction of some other things i order with this
1,Product is a Scam,"This product is nothing but a scam. It is well-researched that magnetic bracelets perform no better than a placebo. There are no health benefits of powerful magnets. It is a pretty bracelet, though definitely not worth the listed price.Save your money and strap a rubber band on your wrist instead. Like theOfficial Lance Armstrong Yellow Cancer LiveSTRONG Rubber Wristband Bracelet."
5,Pain Ease and More Stamina,"I have a cancer type mass in my leg. After two surgeries, here I am just like anyone else with an injury and it aches and throbs from time to time. Having not had therapy since after my 2nd surgery, there's still a bit of scar tissue built up in there, alongside the rest of the cancer I couldn't remove without the losing the ability to flex and retract my ankle. I figured out that blood-flow had a lot to do with my pain. Chances are if your blood isn't moving as freely as it is the rest of your body, that area is going to be fatigued, sensitive, and won't get the sustenance it needs to grow. I used this as an anklet and I felt the change within a day. My leg felt stronger, hardly any pain, and overall I could get through my days and nights even if I was knocked around a bit.It is sensitive to water and can be thrown off if used between more than one person. If you get one, take if off before you get into water, and keep it to yourself."
3,Was not imprssed!,"My review today is focused on the looks, will send a follow up on functionality when it is actually used. The beads look ok, but they were not clean! There was dirt and some sticky stuff on them.. Could be cleaned though.. No problem. The main problem with it is the cheap rubber band that is used and the way it is knotted, good quality accessories use a plastic like material. Delivery and order processing are fine, no issues here.I got this as a gift for my mom. I am glad I got it delivered to me first.."
1,Cheap price and quality!,"Loved the look but the ""string"" they used to make this bracelet only lasted a few weeks and then it broke. I bought another one from a different vendor because it is make with a heavy wire, (fishing leader) material and it is almost 1 year old and going strong! You get what you pay for!"
4,Review for the Hematite Black Pearl Bracelet,I thought these came in men and women sizes. The bracelet it a little loose and it is considered to be unisex and one size fits all. Not bad looking and black goes with anything.
2,It is magnetic,"I know it is a magnet due to the gravity of the situation, but no noticeable change to my physical situation. As with other wrist bands it fits well, and I know it attracts metal, but no other changes. Save your money and move on."
3,OK bracelet,i bought this for my friend and the shipping was incredibly fast and in time for his birthday. He liked it but after awhile it did bother him and started to itch a bit and stop using it for awhile. It hasnt broken or torn it just gets a litting irritating sometimes. I'd give the shipping 5 out of 5 and the bracelet itself 3 out of 5.
1,Bracelet,Because of spending so much time on iPad and computer I was not able to wear this. At one time the bracelet caused my iPad to change screens when I accidentally touched it. Therefore I do not know if this bracelet works or not. That is the only reason I cannot rate this product.
1,blah,"Didn't hold my kids attention. ingrediably boring, very short, monotionus. If your looking for educational stuff, get anything with LEAP wrote on it, esp. the DVD's."
2,too thin and light,The wok was big enough but it was so lightweight and thin. There are better woks out there for better prices.
3,Using modern standards to criticize historical figures isn't exactly fair,"I was very disappointed at the criticism directed at Brace for ""failing to follow up"" and only in the books conclusion does the author state recognition of the lack of technology used by modern social workers to keep track of cases today (and the imperfect results).I do commend the author for his research to paint a picture of urban life in the 1800's"
3,Meh...,"I love garbage. They're one of my favorite bands, but this poster doesn't do them justice. I thought the poster would be all black and shades of gray like in the picture, but it has huge white border that make the poster look bad. It is hang over my bad though =)."
3,An introduction to Tibetan Symbolism in coloring book form,"This simple book illustrates many of the symbols found in Tibetan Buddhist mandalas. The drawings are simple line drawings, suitable for coloring. This book is not intended as a guide to Tibetan Buddhism or the complexities of Tibetan religious art. Rather, it gently introduces a few of the elements of these subjects."
2,"Seemed great, until...","At first this book seemed excellent. I bought it because I wanted to use the illustrations and photos in my own book, which I am simply writing for fun. As you may have guessed my book is on animals. Anyway,the ""Animal Encyclopedia"" has a lot of great information and beautiful pictures. However, upon closer inspection I noticed that the book had many errors. In fact, after searching through the entire book, I came across an astounding 32 errors! These aren't minor errors either. An example is page 349, where they have a picture labeled: great egret, where the bird is obviously a SNOWY EGRET. There is a HUGE difference. So, why give it more than one star? Because besides these numerous errors the book does have a lot of good info. You simply can't rely on every fact to be correct, which sort of defeats the purpose of the book I guess."
3,its just ok,"book condition was very poor, sticky and so old. Information in book is basic enough to grasp something about an animal"
5,Great reference - very thorough.,"I paint gaming miniatures, and this provides wonderful reference material."
4,Excellent live effort,"I originally purchased the LP in 1987 as one of my first Le Orme recordings. This is a very solid performance of Le Orme standards, but without a doubt the show stopper is the intensely percussive ""Truck of Fire"". A must have for any prog fan!"
2,Disappointment!,"This novel was a disappointment after reading ""Birdsong"". The love affair between Anne and Charles lacks feeling, but the incentive to finish the book was to find out Anne's mystery. A total feeling of let-down arrived at the end of this book. There were glimpses into the background of various characters, but none were explored enough to satisfy. One gets the feeling this book was written in a hurry without thought to detail."
3,The second in a trilogy,While this book is not as good as Faulks Birdsong or Charlotte Grey. It does round out the trilogy nicely and provide insight to how Birdsong and Charlotte Grey are connected.
3,"Not his best, but good for a while.","This book is not as good as Birdsong, or any of his others, but there is some good description and well observed characters. There is a significant lack of plot, I would agree, but this is not the books strength, rather the persnal journeys of the individual charachters. Read if you have nothing better."
2,So disappointed,"I discovered Sebastian Faulks with the wonderful Birdsong, which is one of the best books I ever read. I then turned eagerly to this book expecting to have a similar experience. I cannot figure out why, but this book did not engage me in the least. I read the entire book expecting to be drawn in any minute, because I know this author can do that. I was so disappointed. I did not feel any connection between Anne and Hartmann - they supposedly have deep feelings for each other but I couldn't feel a thing. The minor characters such as Roussel, Roland and Christine were actually more finely drawn than the main ones. I so wanted to love this book, but would never recommend it. I will try another book by Faulks, on the strength of how I was carried away by Birdsong, and hope that this book was just an anomaly."
2,"excellent prose, but plot lacking","Although this book managed to hold my interest, I think it was solely because I was on a trip and it was the only book I had with me. While Faulks' descriptions of locales are evocative and intricately written, he seems to fail in his attempts to bring the characters to life. Both Anne and Hartmann seem rather one-dimensional, and Anne's attraction to Hartmann is never satisfactorily explained, except in an obtuse way when she divulges her ""secret."" The other characters seem simply to be neither particularly interesting nor an integral part of the story. Frankly, I was disappointed, and am hoping for better from Birdsong, which was the book I was searching for and was unable to find when I settled for this one."
1,Please tell me what happened!,"I desperately tried to follow the plot, but I was unable to locate one; I tried to like the characters, but what was there to like? What in heavens name was this story ABOUT? Love? I think not! Self centered egotists, maybe. But what did the opening page and the last page SAY? It must have been written in another language because I simply was lost in this tedious dwibble of a book. And I am serious: I hope someone can at least explain the details and depth I obviously missed."
1,Very disappointing...,"Of all the books I have read, this must be the most disappointing... no wonder it took me well over a year trying to read the book with major interruptions as there is nothing to look forward to ..the plot and story-line are absolutely hopeless.... well, to sum it all up, very disappointing!"
4,A story of love and loss,"Sebastian Faulks writes a moving story that takes place in the 1930s about a young woman with a secret so terrible that she has had to change her identity. She has come from Paris to a small seaside village of Janvilliers, to work at the Hotel du Lion d'Or. Upon arriving she meets and falls in love with a married man, Charles Hartmann, and the story follows their affair to its eventual break-up at the end of the book. The story is well written, beautiful and romantic and the characters and settings are very detailed. My only criticism of this book is that Faulks leaves many loose ends...characters and plot lines that are part of the story, disappear, never be seen or heard from again, leaving several story lines hanging. For those looking for passion and romance, love and loss, this is the book for you."
4,Lunar Larry (the game god) Review Of Freaky Flyers,"lUNAR sCORE: ""i know what I'm talkin 'bout trust me""(((WHATS UP)))Very cool if you like stuff like ""trippy HAPPY color levels"" like in Crash, Sly Cooper, or Even Spyro. Or if you love Kart Racing Games like Crash Team Racing...Magical Racing Tour... stuff like that or if you thought Mad Dash was cool you should like this game. It's actually very cartoony and twisted ""hince freaky"" and it's not to easy also. Cool levels and the graphics are PRETTY..very well done. Im sad that it's not being reviewed fairly cuz I think MIDWAY worked hard for this game and it shows...VERY FUN. XBOX only characters too and a cool ""mascot type"" alien guy who of caorse is XBOX green. SO COOL .I found this game very cool RENT it Or Buy It."
1,What a horrible movie!!!,"I agree with another reviewer here...this movie just left me cold and disgusted...I guess people think because it is French, it must be clever? With all the cliches of class struggle, obvious symbolism, and a movie that overstayed its welcome, I just felt, well, almost nauseated....just watch a movie like In Cold Blood which was a thousand times more creative in its handling of ""senseless"" violence...La Ceremonie feels like a cheap porn film with all the sex scenes ""implied""....I doubt I will watch another Chabrol film...what a waste of time!!!"
4,Disturbing and worth seeing,"An excellent portrayal of two very different personalities. Hupert's character is a chilling portrayal of someone with Borderline Personality Disorder. The maid is passive-aggressive. One need not speak psychobabble to understand why the two women are attracted to one another.Hupert's character is at her most horrifying when she describes her baby's death not so much to reveal herself to her new ""friend"" but to righteously justify why it happened; the death of a baby who must have been terrorized into silence by her disturbed and self-centered mother. Haunting."
3,DVD a bit Non-Standard??,"First of all, this IS a truly great movie. A good demonstration of how some gems can get lost in the dross. The favorable reviews here prove the point -- we can safely disregard that one who just doesn't ""get it.""However, of all the DVD's I own, this is the only one that gives me trouble on my CyberHome CH-DVD500 player. Namely:I CAN'T TURN OFF THE ENGLISH SUBTITLES!!!!!They intrude beneath the picture no matter what I do. Perhaps this is a quirk of my player, but if you have the same problem, POST IT HERE and on epinions.com. And write Paramount."
1,widescreen,"Great film. Lousy DVD. The original film has been cut att top and bottom to make it look more like cinema widescreen. Many details that the director meant to be seen are now gone.The original idea with widescreen in cinema was to show more picture at the sides. But here you just get less picture at top and bottom, not more at the sides. The producers try to make money by tricking the buyers with this foul and superficial sales-trick."
3,Quality lacking,"There's a lot of heart that went into this film, and the innovation of Phil's stop-motion procedure breathes life into the dragon. On the heals of early ILM work in the 80's, the main focus, however, still dwells with character development and political/ religious commentary.If the film could somehow be re-mastered, I'd enjoy the product more. As it is, there are many poorly illuminated scenes that are hard for me to see on the tv. During such plentiful moments, this does make a good movie to listen to while doing other things, such as artwork, knitting, or cooking."
4,Nostalgia and cult classics.,"I can remember when my local tv station would run this movie once a year on sunday mornings, and occasionally late friday nights when it was basically out of options. At its time, this movie had great special effects. Also as far as a disney production, this movie explores some very dark themes, as well as developing an incredible storyline. Unfortunately poor acting and slightly slow pacing prevented this title from reaching a huge audience like modern fantasy movies. Dragonslayer is an essential reference for any study of the history of fantasy moviemaking. As a unique storline made before everything coming out of hollywood followed formulaic principiles, this movie is an absolute gem. I highly reccommend this movie for viewers with refined tastes.taunting_llamas"
5,One of the few great fantasy flicks from the 80s.,"Regarding my summary above, sad but true. There really isn't another fantasy movie that's worth comparing to Dragonslayer. Not even Dragonheart whose dragon was completely rendered with computer graphics.The acting and dialogue were excellent. John Hallam's character (Tyrian) seemed to be enjoying himself as the rightious but devious assassin who proceeds to kill anyone who interferes with his kingdom's sacrifices. Then we have the dragon. An old and spiteful dragon who shows no remorse or pity. The dragon is fantastic to look during it's first fight with young Galen. Did I mention the scenery? I could have sworn this movie was actually filmed in sixth century Britain. It was beautiful! Green pastures, giant trees erupting from the ground, huge mountains that ascend into the clouds. This movie is a real treat. I highly recommend it."
4,"Well worth a watch, on the right day","When I first saw this movie as a young teen-ager, I hated it. What I thought was slow and plodding filler between scenes with the dragon turned out to be (as I see as an adult) very interesting episodes putting these naieve characters into the position of people going after the last--and more bitter than ever--dragon on earth.The dragon is by far the most visually stunning one ever rendered on film (much better and more terrible than the one with Sean Connery's voice). On the whole, I watch it when I am sick at home and don't want to move from the couch. It's a great romp, full of interesting visuals, humor, and even a small dose of social commentary."
5,loved it then love it now,I like this creative and inventive magical story when it first came out. It is still as charming a movie now as it was then.
4,Dragonslayer,Good movie with a unique storyline. Special effects were verygood for the time of filming.
5,A classic in Fantasy!,"This movie is about the greatest one' I have seen, well you know what I am saying. IT's action packed, full of surprises, romance, humour. I'd suggest this to anyone. I have this movie, and have watched it many, many, many times, and it still hasn't bored me yet! It's just like the title, a Dragonslayer, goes off, to none the less Slay dragons. Wizards, and bad guys the whole works. The graphics are amazing, and the Dragon's look real. So check it out! You don't know what your missing!"
3,Slayed Again!,this has been a favorite video of mine for years. I love the sound effects from the opening credits throughout the film. A classic!
1,Joke,"Were those other reviews a joke to get others to watch this seriously bad movie? Bad acting, simplistic writing and not believable effects."
1,Dragonslayer Drags On,"Take one over-zealous sorcerer's apprentice add one nasty, evil dragon and the end result is ""Dragonslayer,"" a medieval fantasy which lacks the charm of ""The Princess Bride"" and the intelligence of Arthurian legend. For two hours the film subjects its viewers to stereotypical stock characters and acts of aggression which are too violent for young watchers. Although the special effects are quite good given the date of production, it's not enough to hold one's interest without helping the bland dialogue along."
4,Lovin Dragonslayer,"Loved this as a kid. Still entertaining and holds up pretty well now. Love the go-motion effects and dragon design. give me this and the UK cut of Legend on a rainy afternoon and I'm set. Love seing Emperor Palpatine as a monk getting toasted like a marshmallow. And of course Sir Ralph Richardson rules as the wily old wizard. Recommended to children of the 80's. Modern audiences may be too cynical to give it a fair shake. But between me and you, ""I'd buy that for a dollar.""Only thing that could make it better: I would love to see Dirk The Daring running through the background during the escape from the castle. (check the link[...]"
5,One of the best gritty fantasy films ever.,Hey I gotta give this one five stars for being one of the best gritty fantasy films ever. The only one better would be Conan the Barbarian. Saw it when I was 12 and loved it. Saw it again when I was 25 and loved it more.If you want a fantasy movie without cutesy characters and stupid themes this is the one.
4,A Fine Gift ...,"I took a chance on this gift basket because it was on sale and I was not disappointed. This is a great gift for anyone who enjoys smoked salmon. There is a nice variety of sizes. The salmon comes vacuum packed, canned, and as a spread with a nice package of water crackers all in a very clean and crisp basket.Good value. Nice gift."
1,Find something else,"I tried this based on store staff recommendation. 2 days later I had 2 fish instead of 7 fish. The ich is gone, but just as likely because I raised the tank temp to 82F as the directions on the bottle suggest. When I went back to the store, two other staff told me it was not a great product. They also told me that raising the tank temp so high in a short time (as in 1 degree per hour) was bad for the fish."
3,Super Ick,"I used it but my fish died shortly after. but, I am sure this product works well, just have to buy more fish to make sure."
1,Crapy Product,"I bought some of this because a new guppy I had bought was scratching and soon after my four minnows were scratching. The first dose of this killed my weakest minnow which I was almost positive would happen. The second dose killed the remaining 3 minnows. Now all that is left is the guppy.Dyed the seams of my aquarium and all the suction cups blue. I also think it tinted the glass blue. Hopefully bleach will get rid of the blue and the tint after I have a chance to break down the aquarium for deep cleaning.You live, you learn."
2,PukeVC,This book was unoriginal junk. Almost everything in the book was projects that could have been thought up by a two year old with an idea of what pvc was and some crayons. The only remotely interesting project was for the sled. Why isn't the spudgun included in this book??? Definitly NOT worth the $17 I paid to buy it and have it shipped.
1,Worst book ever,"They actually have plans for a PVC walking stick. Weapons? String two footlong pieces together to make nunchucks, etc. I guarantee anyone out there could write this book in 15 minutes. A terrible waste of money, I'm sorry I bought it."
2,Very basic,"This book has a couple of novel ideas for things that could be made with PVC but they are so basic that anyone who is the least bit handy around the house/shop could make them without the book. The only plus is that, if you did want to build one of these projects, the book gives a materials list and the measurement so you dont have to figure that stuff out yourself.Had it been from a local store I would have returned it, but it isnt worth the shipping to send it back to Amazon."
2,PVC PROJECTS,"I was very (Very) disapointed with this book. The projects were very (very) basic and for the most part incomplete. You were shown how to make the PVC part of the project and left to fend for yourself on how to complete the project and make it ""useful""; example: the PVC snowshoes. I may have had higher expectation of what insight this book may have provided, as I have run a plumbing and electrical service business for 35 years. PVC is an excellent material to work with I.ve had a lot of material to experiment with. The projects in this book are on a ""tinker-toy"" level. There are so many more ways to utilize this material. I am sure the author had good intentions but I absolutely feel this book was a waste of my money and my time. Before you write another book, Mr. Forbes, try to become somewhat knowlegable on the subject. A book should teach you something or at least entertain you."
3,Good but not Great,I was expecting a little more from this title. I would only get if you are extremely bored at home and have nothing else to do.
1,Not worth the Money,"To Me this was a wast of my Money, I though that there would of been more and better plans but no just a hand full that was more made for maybe a kid to do.PVC Projects for the Outdoorsman : Building Shelters, Camping Gear, Weapons and More Out of Plastic Pipe"
1,Don't throw away your money on this one,I had high hopes thinking I would learn some really cool things to made and gave fun with my son. If you want to learn how to make a long straight walking stick from a long straight piece of PVC this is your book. I found no real outdoors man projects as the titl claims. If you have any amount of imagination you could not only make any of the projects in the book but you could write your own book. Hopefully with better instructions too.
1,"This book is ok, but have seen better on topic of SI","This book is ok, but have seen better on topic of SI, it should have had just a little more info in it, great things listed in the book but not too much info about how or where this sightings have been documented and by whom? the sources of these sighting."
2,good value but I did not see all these wonderful pictures?,good value but I did not see all these wonderful pictures?
1,You have to be joking?,"This book is a joke? Maybe.Maybe not. I think it is. I have lived on the Island, and never heard of any of the tales within this book. The author wrote or made up most of what is in it. The stories are false or taken out of context. I can't understand why anyone would want to publish false information like this."
4,students review of a classic lesson,"A wonderfully eloquant review of the ""modern"" mind's evolution from its barbarous Judeo-Christian beginnings up until the industrial age. Makes powerful arguments for science's positive efffects upon man(as well as being historically and technically acurate), as well as questioning the negative effect it has had on man's morals and reason. A good read for someone out there lost amidst the multimedia education of hyperactive universities, just looking for a articulate lesson in man's chaotic growth. If you can find the time to read all seven hundred pages, do so at all costs."
3,"Older, bigger Boppy tummy play is better","I saw this in the store and almost bought it. Then I looked online and saw the older version of this toy. It is a longer mat and comes with 3 toys, not 2. It is much better for encouraging tummy time than this one. This is just boppy with toys on the front. If you have a regular boppy, you could do that yourself. The older one is only available used, which is how I bought mine on ebay. I washed it and santizied the toys and it was good as new."
3,Waste of Money particularly if you have the Big Boppy,"I got this for my son and he wasn't too fond of it as he's not fond of tummy time already. And I found this to be unnecessary as I already have a boppy pillow as a nursing pillow and that works just the same. In fact, it works a bit better because the small boppy seems to be too small as it closes too tightly on him in the ends. So I returned it as you can use the Boppy nursing pillow to do the same and just use whatever toy you have to entice your little one to be on his tummy."
3,Would have been 5 stars but 3 out of 4 arrived broken,"I was so looking forward for a set of these canisters but to my disappointment, only 1 out of 4 survived the poor packaging. And the customer service rep said they were not in stock so that I couldn't order replacements for the 3 broken ones. I see that there are red ones available but I need blue. Otherwise, the quality is good but watch out for bad packing."
5,Unbelievable,"That is all I can say about this album. Clifford Adams has made the first smooth jazz trombone album and it is fantastic. From the first and very inspiring song ""24/7/365"" to the remembrance of the 9/11 incident on the song ""Ground Zero"". He even does a version of ""Slam Dunk For MJ"" which was first done by Kool & The Gang.The cut that got me was the last song ""In A Minute"". It wasn't even a conceived song until the bass player started playing a little line and then they all joined in a jam session which turned out to be a slamming song. I am a valve trombonist and I really enjoyed this album by Mr. Adams. I hope he decides to do more smooth jazz in the near future."
1,Amateur production - very disappointing,"This DVD does not live up to it's description. The entire video is comprised of a guy in a very ugly shirt standing in front of a temple 'talking' mostly about the history of the Samurai. Toward the end of the video, it loses voice sync. It is really, really bad. It appears that the guy set up a video camera and filmed himself talking then decided to make a buck off of it. I only hope that Amazon will let me return this sad excuse of a video."
4,Blind Swordsman,"Another in a fine series of Shintaro Katsu films. If you are a fan of any of his previous Blind Swordsman series, you will love this one just the same.After watching two or three of the series, I have wanted to get the whole series. If possible you should try to get the special that has all the videos for a discounted price since it is a bulk purchase.If you are a first time Blind Swordsman viewer, i advise renting any of the series from Blockbuster to see if you like it before you spent a larger amount purchasing something you might not like."
5,Blind chess expert,I really enjoyed this Zatoichi adventure. Not just because of the swordwork which is great in all of them but because of the intricate storytelling and plot in this one which was really incredible. I loved the gambling scene in the beginning of this one and how the story unfolded after that was great. I own quite a few of these films and have yet to be dissapointed in any one of them.Zatoichi rules.
3,A mixed read!,"I bought this as it came highly recommended from a couple of sources. While some of the sources are nice, some are too simplistic or could do with a touch of brevity. There is perhaps nothing highly original or extremely striking about this collection. I would recommend reading a few stories before you decide to buy it!"
4,Works fine --,Product worked just as stated; no problems at all. Great purchase for the price. Now my children can watch their old school tapes on the VCR.
4,"Works well, but the mechanism is a little stiff","I chose this model on the basis of other reviews here, and I also recommend it. It works well; the only problem is that the mechanism is a little stiff to move so you need to apply a bit of force when you open or close the slide."
3,Better than most stuff....,"This cool album is better than most stuff that is passing for ""garage rock"" these days. The tight tunes powered by some cool organ pounding help to elevate the Forty Fives above the new, dorky garage crowd. However, the Forty Fives lack the soul-power that make a band like the Lyres so great. You can't fake soul."
4,Ease into Bluegrass the Donaghey way,"Visiting a bluegrass music festival is more enjoyable when one knows something about the musical group on stage. A few years ago, Bob Donaghey, a lover of bluegrass musical, was frustrated that no biographical guides were available at these events -- so he created his own. This ""Bluegrass Yearbook"" is a great teacher, with a short chapter and a photo devoted to each of bluegrass's major and on-the-rise groups and performers. For autograph seekers, the book is perfect size and easy to handle. One suggestion: although the book has a useful index, a table of contents would make this reference book even more useful."
5,CrAzY LoVe is the best!,"It looks like this 2002 collection of ALL NEW music by Melanie will become a clasic! Her voice is better than ever. Age has been very kind to her. Her writing is wonderful and the production work done by her husband Peter and her son Beau is better than Dr Dre. The recording done by some guy named Rick is awsume. What else can I say, ""Try a little CrAzY LoVe, it feels good! :-)"
2,UGH!,"At least the disc wasn't blank, but it was not what I was looking for. The description online was not very good so I had to take a chance and hope it was the right one. There was no director or producer listed for the title, so I really had no idea if it was the right one. It was cheap enough that I got over it, but I'd like to be able to read a good description of what I'm buying."
1,Poor craftsmanship,"This sprinkler stopped rotating and just leaks water from the bottom shortly after I purchased it, but it happened outside the return window so I am stuck with a sprinkler that does not work."
4,gilmore sprinkler,"Have used these sprinklers before, and I am pleased with them. Inexpensive and seem to last . Would recommend them. MV"
4,Price Double Check please!!!!!!!!!!!,I just saw this game on gbastore.com It only cost me 8.99 do not I repeat do not buy this game here
4,Thank you to previous reviewers!,I was about to purchase this game when I saw another reviewer's alert about the price! I took the advice and checked out gbastore.com. Game is 8.99 + 6.95 for shipping. Thank you for the information!
1,This Game is not worth your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My brother had his birthday recently. He wanted a game boy advance game. As soon as he mentioned tom & jerry, I told him not to make such a stupid mistake. Wouldn't you know it....he did. This game sucks!!!Here are my ratings for it.Graphics- 4/5Gameplay- 1/5Plot- 3/5Overall- 3/5Please!! Heed my warning, don't make this mistake."
1,"Boring game, don't recommend.",There is not much to say. IT is just a boring game that my kids tried for a little while and never played again.
5,Best loved children's songs ever,"Our children and those of our friends still use lyrics from the songs proving that the heritage is valued and important, especially in making the notion of perseverance into a memorable musical phrase ."
2,Don't get your hopes too high,"I can't understand how this book got as many good reviews as it did. The fact that it was written by a former LEO made me expect that I would get good information beyond what I've heard in casual conversation with friends. Instead, I kept wondering ""Where's the inside information?""There is some good information, in the chapter about the traffic stop, about what information to gather to prepare a defense. Otherwise, there is a lot of very obvious advice, and some repeated info to pad the book out.The tips in the ""Learn to Speed and Not Get Caught!"" chapter are lame, and some of the excuses for speeding the author lists (that he says worked on him as an officer) are downright ridiculous).Richard Wallace really should have used a co-author; it's a very poorly written book.My advice: If you want to buy this book, get it used, and don't pay more than a few dollars for it."
4,Was perfect for my 1 year old,We were a family of vampires for Halloween last year and this was perfect for my youngest. The only down side was the collar did not stay up very well so I had to pin it up.
2,"Cute costume, HORRIBLE quality","While this costume looked cute in pictures (both this one and on our son), it was horrible flimsy quality. Barely made it through the three Halloween events and was trashed afterwards. On the positive side, it's easy to get into, son was comfortable in it and from far away it looked good. But if you're kid's a climber, crawler, etc. you may want to go with something sturdier."
1,this game sux,"first of all, the camra sux, second u can't even kill the bad guys, u have to hit them to them to the ground and arrest them. this is really hard when a bunch of guys are u. they should sell this game for 1 buck, even then people wouldn't buy it. i bought this game thinking it would be like rise of sin zu...i was wrong. unlike batman rise of sin zu, it dosent have 2 player cooperative...don't buy it"
1,Batman sux ass one hundred percent,"Batman: Dark Tomorrow is a study in poorly conceived, aggravating gameplay and marks yet another failed caper for the caped crusader. Even die-hard fans will want to tie the disc to a Batarang and hurl it out the window. Just hope it doesn't come back."
5,BETTER THAN VENGEANCE!!!,"THIS GAME IS AWESOME AND A LOT OF FOLKS WERE EXPECTING THIS GAME TO SURPASS VENGEANCE WITH FLYING COLORS, BUT IT IS A COMIC TURNED VIDEO GAME, SO KNOWING THIS, WHY COMPLAIN!!THIS IS A SIMPLE COMIC GAME AND YOU REALLY CANNOT EXPECT IT TO BE MUCH BETTER THAN MEDIOCRE. I ACCEPTED THIS AND THAT IS WHY I CAN ENJOY THIS GAME.THANK YOU"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I just got this game today and I am taking it back after 15 minutes of playing. the camera angles stink, the graphics aren't too bad but I just think the game is dumb in general"
1,Give me a break.....,"I don't even know what to say...Let me just sum it up this way - I REALLY, REALLY wanted to like this game (I'm a HUGE Batman fan)- Unfortunately, sub-standard graphics, HORRIBLE controls and UNFORGIVEABLE camera angles earned this game a spot on my shelf right next to Superman for the Xbox. If you really want to buy the game, wait a while for the price to drop as this game plainly stinks."
1,This game sucked!,"The only thing good about it were the cut-scenes(which they used to sell the game). The game-play sucked. Try swinging from the roofs in the first level. Hell, the first fight after the great cut-scene before it tells you what you're in for, CRAP! Don't waste your time or money. Go for Vengeance or Rise Of Sin Tzu."
1,Horrible,Let me start of with the good qualities of this game... Oh wait there are none. This has got to be one of the worst batman games ever. Aside from that the camera angles are rediculous. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game.
1,Terrible game,"As a big fan of comic book gaming, I looked forward to playing a Batman game. Boy was I disappointed. First off, this game actually looks great, the graphics are some of the nicest I've seen on the small screen. That being said, the game play is impossible. Many times your objective is not obtainable due the camara angles, which are the worst of any game I've ever played. If your looking for a good comic book games for the Xbox, see X-Men Legends or Spiderman. Return this game as fast as possible!!!"
5,You'll love it if you're interested in Japanese manga,I'm a huge Manga fan and this book is great to help any reader understand the history of Japanese manga.
3,Not for Children,This is a great book about Japanese animation. I ordered it for my twelve year old daughter as a Christmas present since she loves anime. You should be aware that there are many graphic sexual drawings that leave nothing to the imagination. It is borderline pornographic. Expect to tear out lots of pages if this is for children.
3,A pretty good romance,"I have a couple minor complaints but over all I enjoyed the book. It was a little predictable. First I agree w/a previous reviewer that they jumped into bed way too quickly. And I wish romance novelists would pay attention to the covers for their books. The girl on the cover is clearly light blond and in the book is described repeatedly as having dark chestnut hair. But then I noticed that the sister Meghan is described as having very dark hair in this book. And on the cover for her story, A Promise of Roses, she has very vibrant blond hair. I know silly complaints but still. If you're going to take the time to hire 2 beautiful people for the cover of a book they ought to at least resemble the characters in said book."
2,Very thin,It is paper like and so fragile.It will easily rip.The babies R us multi use pad or huggies changing pads are better in quality.This item is good if you want something cheap and large quantity.
3,They're okay for the price...,"I received some free samples of huggies and decided to order more and I found this way cheaper than huggies so I ordered this instead. They are just a piece of plastic, not absorbent at all.They're okay to use at public changing tables. They're ok for the price though"
1,"thin, leaks, tears",totally horrible. don't buy. they ought to stop selling this item. waste of time & money. get huggies or babiesrus type
2,You Get What You (Don't) Pay For,"I thought I'd try these out since they were 1/4 of the price of the Huggies changing pads. I got 1/4 of the quality... they are tiny and ultra thin. Like an itchy paper towel with saran wrap stuck to the back of them. If you want something you can lay down and actually be happy to change your baby on, this is not the product for you."
2,Fall apart so easily,"These pads are so cheaply made. They can't stand a chance with a baby kicking their legs during diaper change. I have the box just sitting there almost full because I can get no use out of them. Maybe as placemats??Anyway, it honestly makes more sense to pay more for the Huggies pads because they at least last a week or so compared to these that last not even a full diaper change."
2,Eh (shrug),"Cheap price, but cheap quality too. The baby just kicks and tears it because it's paper thin and moisture sometimes soaks through. They're ok for keeping in the diaper bag for when you're out, but too much of a hassle to use all the time on a changing table or baby bed."
1,Not what I was looking for...,"I should have read more carefully the previous comments...These changing pads are really too thin, not what I was looking for and expecting...Like a previous user was saying, it is a bit like the disposable papers at the dentist :sSo a bit useless, but well... We are using them, but we will not buy again!"
2,A little disappointed,"They were much thinner than I expected and therefore did not lay flat when I changed my grandson. The price is excellent. However, it's not much thicker than a paper towel which doesn't stay in place while changing a baby. It is water-proof and will do what it needs too on that category."
5,Excellent,I love this product. Easy to use. My baby love to play when I use this to change diaper. I do not find this item in store.
1,Flimsy!,"I bought these figuring why do I need to drop a bunch of money on something that's only going to get pooped on and thrown away? But I guess you get what you pay for. These are about half the length of the Munchkin changing pads, so I need two of them to line my changing table. And they're cheap-feeling—thin and crinkly, easily kicked around by a squirming baby. I won't buy these again."
1,"Small, not absorbent enough & wafer thin","To me, these are terrible. They are small (only covering half of the surface under the baby), don't absorb much (as its like a piece of paper with a thin plastic coat on the back) and they are WAY to thin that my baby tears it all the time just from kicking and has done so since the age of 4 months. Personally I wont buy them again."
3,Good for the Price,"I used these as an extra top layer on my changing table. They are a good price, but are small and thin. I never had problems with leaks running through, but my son is very excited when is on the changing table & his kicks always ripped them up immediately. I never really got to put these to the test since I was having to throw them away without even really allowing them to serve their purpose. If your child isn't a fierce kicker, they would work well as a top layer on a changing table. Just remember they are super thin & rip easily! I would not purchase these for use in traveling situations as they just don't cover enough space. For travel, I would suggestJL Childress Full Body Changing Pad, Blackas it covers everything so I never worry about my son touching anything head to toe."
2,not what i was expecting,These are really thin. They slide around easily. This can add to the mess. The Neat Solutions or Huggies ones are worth the extra money.
1,Too thin,"Whenever my son's even slightly damp skin touches it, it sticks to him and a piece comes off. The waterproof backing makes this extremely slippery and won't stay in place anyway. I've used similar products before, and while those could be used multiple times, had we wished it, these ones don't even last through one!"
1,way too small and flimsy,What a waste! they are so tiny! it takes 5 or 6 of these things to cover a changing table in a public restroom - and they are so thin (like a sheet of paper or papertowel - that they blow around as you put them down and if your kid moves... it just did not work for me at all. I can't even think of a useful way to use up what i have left.Much better to buy wee wee pads they make for puppies/kittens - they are sturdy and large enough to cover a changing table.
2,Too flimsy & sticks to baby's bottom when trying to change,"I knew these where a cheap price when I bought them, so can't say that I didn't expect that it might be a cheap product which they are. They are soooo thin and flimsy. I was using Babies R Us store brand of disposible pads before and these don't even compare. They are so thin that they stick right to my baby's butt when changing and I'm wrestling with them to unstick them and try to get a diaper under my baby; they just fold and crinkle up. Not even worth $5. I'd say they're only worth $1. I do not plan to ever buy these again. Not recommended for every day use."
1,Worst product ever!,Box advertises Absorbent/Soft. EPIC FAIL!You may as well go to HD and buy the thin plastic they sell. This product is THAT terrible.Paper part is non-existent.Thing rips.They are too small to cover any useful area.For a baby product - it's unusable!Dog? Grandma? maybe!Stop selling this crap!Any 5 star reviews on this are totally fake!
3,Flimsy but workable,"This product is not nearly as good at the disposable change pads by Toys R Us brand, but unfortunately, those are only available in the U.S. stores. This product does keep the wetness from soaking through somewhat as long as the leak isn't too much, but the two layers are very thin and easily tear. If you can get Toys R Us or Huggies brands, they are definitely higher quality, but in a pinch these will work."
2,too thin..,"We usually use the disposable changing pads from babiesrus but decided to give this one a try.But it's way too thin that when our son pees, the urine will actually go through the pad and rip the pad a little.It's way too thin to use.."
2,More like dental bibs,I was really hoping these were thicker and more absorbent but these are more like dental bibs and quite thin. I am hoping I will find some other use for them in the future.
2,Pretty flimsy,Babies R Us has another brand that works much better - I just hate going into that store so thought I'd order these instead. These are much lower quality - tear while baby is sitting on them.
2,Not a very good product,I purchased these pads to replace the babies r us brand ones when I ran out. My daughter loves to kick her legs when being changed and these pads are so flimsy that they would crumple up and rip. Not worth the money.
1,These are papers NOT pads,"These are not absorbent at all. My baby regularly pees on the changing table and I have used puppy pads in the past for easy clean-up. They were a little pricey so I thought I would try these. I used maybe two and the rest are sitting in a drawer. After trying these I went back to using puppy pads. Also, I know it is a little strange to comment on, but the pattern on these ""pads"" includes different colors of baby hands. One of the colors is red which looks like bloody little hand prints. Gross."
3,Good for the price,"These aren't as thick as the Pee Wee pads, but at half the price, iy's a good deal. The descripyion left the size off: 13 x 9"""
3,"All the music, but ...","This CD gives you more of the Namouna ballet music than any other one out there, and for this reason alone it's worth it for devotees of Lalo's special brand of propulsive, rhythmic, French musical late romanticism to acquire. But to my mind, Maestro Robertson's interpretation is heavy-handed in quite a few numbers of the score -- as if he's thinking of this as a symphonic poem rather than a ballet. To really hear how effective this music can be when treated to true Gallic wit and style, turn instead to Paul Paray's superlative recording of the Ballet Suite #1 on Mercury. Even though it includes less than half the music recorded here, it's the better choice. Also, the Detroit Symphony in the Paray recording is far more fleet-footed and polished than the earnest yet ultimately unsatisfying efforts of the Monte-Carlo players."
5,Straight Outta Compton,"I have to admit I'm not the biggest rap fan in the world (in fact, I don't like rap too much. I like N.W.A. and Run DMC. The rest of it isn't for me.), but I will say that along with Run DMC, these guys reinvented the genre with this powerful debut album. ""Straight Outta Compton"" was the point where rap stopped being a great way to market clean cut young guys like the Fresh Prince (aka Will Smith) to the masses & started telling it like it is. Rap is and always will be street music about life in the neighborhoods and this was never documented more clearly than on this album. With songs like ""F___ Tha Police"" and ""Gangsta Gangsta"" Dre, Ice Cube, (the late) Eazy E, etc. captured a snapshot of South Central L.A. life that the majority never heard about pre-Rodney King & L.A. riots. Before you go & buy the latest Eminem or 50 Cent release, find a copy of this & discover the REAL reason rap & hip-hop became the voice of a new generation."
5,thought Eazy Duz It was better this is still good,"I thought Eazy Duz It blows all NWA CDs this is still a great album and by the way mike ""michael"" review is funny as hell but i got a feeling it is a fake, why would he go i have no friends please email me. and go i get made fun of still it was funny but i know its a fake."
4,"they invented gangsta rap, pretty much","This is the record that for all intents and purposes invented gangster rap. I still remember where I was when I heard this, and, like hearing Public Enemy's debut, my reaction was a mix of ""What the [...] is THIS?"" and ""where are my drums?""MCs Ice Cube, Ren and Eazy E are massive cartoon ""niggaz,"" swearing, shooting, screwing and smacking their way through a landscape of lusty women, corrupt cops, suckas, drug dealers and gangsters. Dre and Yella's beats are simple, solid yet at times oddly fluid. It would be hard to think of any social group that NWA leaves off its offensive, funny and often very insightful hit list: blacks, whites, police, women, gays, straights, gangsters, dealers, politicians, pot smokers, gold-diggers. Perhaps the only group NWA doesn't take aim at are religious.20 years later, it's still fresh, funny and booty-shakeable. Enjoy ""the strength of street knowledge!"""
1,This is NOT NWA!!!,I was very disappointed when I listened to this CD. I expected this to be a soundtrack of songs played by NWA (Northwest Airlines) on their planes. Instead I heard a couple of guys whining about police and white people.
1,This Is Not What They Play On Northwest Airlines...,"What Have they done?They've cheated me!I bought a cd that says N.W.A straight out of Compton, and they give me this crap?I am going to go throw it away and eat atleast 4 pancakes..."
1,Bad Words!,"My mommy forbids me from listening to anything other than country music, and I get made fun of for it. People at school tell me to listen to rap and rock music. One of them reccomended the group N.W.A. . When I asked them what it meant, they told me it stood for (Bad Words) With Attitudes. Now, Martin Luther King, Jr. taught me not to say that word, so I was confused when I heard it being used so much by African Americans. This music is not good for you, it has bad words. I reccomend Toby Keith or Gretchen Wilson, because country is awesome! If you are looking for rap, go buy the Baha Men or Lil Bow Wow. Mommy told me that rap is evil!"
2,Good but not great!,This video is only for those who have not played much football. If you have been coached at any level in the passed you won't need to watch it.
4,Interesting Collection of Pictures,I was somewhat disappointed with the selections of songs presented in the book. The pictures are great. The cost was probably too much considering the collection of songs.
4,great?,"This game got a pretty fair review from game website. As far as the presentation goes, it is the most impressive game I have ever seen. I always dream to be able to control a giant robot. And I think this is as close as it gets for now. The controller with 40 buttons adds realism to the game. It is a definite must have for all the hard core gamer. I believe that this game will soon go online in 2003. is way too expensive consider all the gamer out there aren't printing their money for living!"
3,WAY OVERATED,"OK, this is a great game, very unique and revolutionary, but please dont be fooled, this game is way overpriced, especially when u can go buy 4 other games for the price of this one. I am a seasoned gamer, and i decided to buy this game. It was fantastic for the first 2 hours, than it got old, diffuculty was raised rapidly, toward driving me crazy.Also, the controller feel VERY cheap, i was expecting something great out of this 40-button controller, but it's just mad out of cheap bendable plastic.So please, save your money, rent one, or borrow one from a friend..... or better yet, BUY ONE (i need to sell the one i have and get halo 2 ;) !!! )"
2,Too much cost for too little!!!,"This game is a great sim don't get me wrong but if you have a PC Go buy all the mechwarrior tittles they are all rather low priced now and if your looking for a controller go find a Saitek Flight control system. With all of the mechwarrior games you get more variety in the mech you control, weapon loadouts, speed vs. armor. And lots more missions. Plus online fun with a mission editor. All that for the cost of this hunk of junk, and the controllers work for anything from space fighters, to real aircraft. Not just one or in this case two games."
4,You will like it,"I will not bother to write a different review for each Zatoichi movie. I have all twenty six of his movies and have watched all of them multiple times. Although the believability of a blind swordsman is next to nill, Zatoichi makes it believable because you will fall in love with the character. Shintaro Katsu is one of my all time favorite actors."
5,Another Nora Ephron hit.,Nora Ephron's books are all good and this one is especially funny. She writes the way she talks and that's always truthfully hilarious. Some of her experiences are painful and yet she manages to turn it around in her quirky way and make it a fun read.
5,Fast Delivery!,"Nora Ephron Knows How to Hit the Funny Bone! Somethings she writes seem a little crass upon first reading, then her recipes of dialogue, characters and scenes really start to flow into proper perspective. Gotta love it! I now have purchased 5 of her books. I highly recommend this author and her novels.When your down in spirits just pick up a Nora Ephron book and soon your worries and cares are melted away with smiles, and giggles. I really did say giggles. Those cheery thoughts have taken the woes away, if only for a short time. It's nice to have a book to come home to or just get away from the rat race of life. I feel you have to have a strong understanding of life to get the total concept of Ms. Ephrons writings. They are well worth the read and time. Women are the ones who will get the most out of her novels."
3,Wounded,"I adore Nora Ephron, which means I have very high expectations of everything she writes. I miss her so much I read this older title and was a bit disappointed. It was funny in a bleak kind of way. And she managed some great zingers. But it never had me laughing/crying the way ""I Feel Bad About My Neck"" did. My gut feeling is that she was a little too freshly wounded to make betrayal and the breakup of a marriage funny. I'm guessing I'm the last of her fans to read this, so my opinion won't matter a bit. Everyone else read this years ago!"
5,Heartburn!,"BUT, why was my copy of Heartburn by Nora Ephron damaged. The cover was torn in half???????????? JUST LET ME KNOW WHY. I do not wish to return my copy. I guess I can work with 1/2 a cover!!"
2,Nora got better as she got older,"I love Nora Ephron's screenplays, but this doesn't top my list of favorites. I didn't get the whole recipe idea, but I did try the viniagrette which isn't bad."
2,Not so Tasty,"I didn't like this book. Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago. The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good. I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does. Bummer."
2,"Second-rate writing, boring characters","Shallow characters - the only one who comes a quarter-way alive is the main character, the others are mere sketches. Nothing made me laugh, nothing made me cry, nothing made me care. Don't waste your time on this; read ""A Death in the Family"" (James Agee) instead, or any number of really good books."
1,Terrible writing from the seventies,"First I readWoodward and Bernstein: Life in the Shadow of Watergate. It is an excellent book and I got interested in all the people, including Nora Ephron. Next I readby Nora Ephron (Author)I Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts On Being a Woman (Vintage) [Paperback]. That is a totally funny book. Finally, I wanted to read the book , mentioned in both the above books, that Nora Ephron says is a thinly disguised novel about her first marriage. I ordered Heartburn. It is very disappointing. It is an example of terrible writing in the general mood of the 1970's which was to let it all hang out. Back then it was like 'wow' she really wrote this? Reading it now, it is embarrassing and not politically correct. The book doesn't hold up over the years. Kind of like Nora Ephron's neck."
2,"Blah, blah, blah","Come on Nora...you were better than this. Poorly written and although there is some humor it is mostly ""old hat"". She was a terrific writer and this is not one of her better ones."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I'm a huge fan of Nora Ephron's essays, so I assumed I'd love her fiction just as much. I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't rave about it."
4,A special kind of humor,"Here is a book that takes a tough topic, a woman deserted by the husband she loves while she's pregnant with his child, and somehow makes it really funny and not in the least bit depressing. What's really amazing, is it's based on truth, but then truth is often stranger than fiction as they say. Some of the scene where we explore the lovable heroine, Rachel's, inner thoughts are just hysterical and the book was a fast and enjoyable read. I love how she digresses into recipes at the oddest moments too!"
3,excellent,"I like this novel so much I read it twice. Much of it is based on Ephron's marriage to Bernstein... but it is witty and funny, gritty and rich. Highly recommended."
2,Not my favorite,"First time I read a book from Nora E. And I dont think I will try again. Very long to get into, not captivating enough for me. Good enough that I will read it to the last page, but not for me something is missing, not my favorite."
3,Emotion and A Sense of Wonder,"This is an amazing little piece of music. Wonderful talent making it as well ex/members from Cross My Heart,Strike Anywhere, and Dead Red Sea.The Opening track is stellar. Nice guitar grooves. The rhythm is superb. The Lead singers voice (Ryan Shelkett) is a perfect match with the melody. The rest of the album is a little weaker then the title track but are all interesting enough to keep your attention.The lyrics are very sweet and subtle with emotion and a sense of wonder. And the singer deals with the raw emotion of wanting to escape a lot on this record. Over all it will remind you of early 90s pop/rock songs.If this band put more time into every song like track one. Well they would be easily a favorite band to many rock fans. But that is yet to be seen. Over all a good record but the band shows depth and maybe the next record will be a little more inspiring."
1,WORST GAME EVER!!!,"I rented this game and played it for 10 minutes before I ripped it out and put in ""HALO"". You can only choose between three snowmobiles that bare no resemblance to real snowmobiles. Boring tracks and you cant do any free styling. Dont even rent this game!"
2,"comme ci, comme ca",Dont buy. Instead just buy world series baseball 2k3 or halo or mechassault or splinter cell or well almost anything.
3,A good fundemantel,"This is another good *basic* book from Nestor Capoeira. It includes basic theories, history and some basic capoeira movements. Seems like this book is second part of ""The little Capoeira book""If you have just started to learn Capoeira, or if you are wondering what it is, this book would be very helpful for you.On the other hand, if you are already a baptized capoeirista you can not find anything that you dont know, in this book."
1,Disappointing,I made a mistake when I ordered. I thought it would be by Rupert Everett the British writer/actor. So I was dismayed to receive these poems by asimilar sounding author.
3,Elvis revisited,"I had read this book many years ago and for some reason it would pop up in my mind every now and then. I wanted to read it again but I couldn't remember enough about it to find it again until I REALLY searched Amazon's Books and FOUND it!!It stretches the imagination much too far but in a fun sort of way. I did enjoy reading it again. Sort of desert novel. (Thats a book that you don't take seriously and can get a quick fun read out of)I would like to see one written dealing with Elvis's twin brother had he lived. THAT would be interesting no doubt.The plot is that Elvis wanted a son but he wanted him to grow up in a ""normal"" environment . So he has a lawyer help him find a Plastic Surgeon who has been experimenting with cloning in his hidden lab. This man ""creates"" an Elvis cloned son.The story is mostly about this boy trying to find out who has left him a LOT of money. Its a mystery, love story and science fiction all rolled into one."
1,Knife Sharpening,"A very small booklet (4"" X 5 1/2"", 29 crudely illustrated pages stapled together) which gives some information about the principles of sharpening outdoor knives but is short on technique. Save your two dollars if you are really interested in this subject, and apply them to one of the more substantial books on sharpening, any of which cover everything covered here, much better."
5,Un libro obligatorio,"Un libro inteligentemente escrito, original y sensible : yo digo que un libro perfecto que cuenta una historia no tan perfecta. Me costo leer las ultimas paginas por las lagrimas. Llore por aquella guerra civil espanola que lamentablemente me recuerda el presente, las divisiones en Venezuela, lo absurdo y terrible que son las guerras. Un libro obligatorio por su contenido y para los amantes de la buena literatura, por su forma."
2,Not up-to-date,Look for the new Rick Steves Europe video series that is now running on public television.
4,great for the price,"Received table from Amazon - shipment was quick, the table comes in a long heavy box. Had to carry bits and pieces from he garage to the basement - was not too much of an ordeal. The table takes some time to assemble. The base comes together quickly. The main top is in two long pieces, take your time to assemble. All in all, it took me 5 days of on and off work, an hour or two each day. Once leveled out the table plays smoothly and with no warp - which is great. Just remember to take your time when working with the plaster and razor blade to fill and smooth the cracks and holes. You will need to sand and clean the table before fitting on the cloth. We now play as often as we can, and have a lot of fun doing so. Good table at a good price. Alan"
2,Not worth the time,Does not hold up well over time--not enough Peter Sellers to make it worth while. Don't bother with this movie.
3,I remembered it being funnier... not entertaining to my kids,"I enjoyed seeing this movie as a little kid, but my kids were bored. It got zero laughs, even from my 8-yr old who laughs at everything. That being said, it still was the lead-in to a series of movies that I loved as a kid."
3,The Pink Panther,I thought the movie was ok.If u were 12 u would love the movie.It was funny in a kind of weird way.If you have kids and u are fun then you should go see it. If your single dont bother.
4,SELERS IS FUNNY BUT NIVEN IS IN IT MORE?,"This question arose when I was watching the scene where Niven and the Princess were talking in Nivens room. Why was Peter Sellers not the main star? Simple. Niven was ahuge star at the time, and Selers was not well known. I'm not saying this movie is bad. I laghed my head off during the costume ball, and was amazed during the gorila scene. I also liked the part when they were chasing eachother in those cars. The story had agood plot and the score was excelent but they needed cut some parts. Oh yeah, they made Niven apear like a bacheoler. I thought he was old. If you want to see David Niven at his best, go watch Around the World in 80 Days."
3,Takes awhile to get going,"David Niven's Sir Charles was supposed to be the original focus of this film, with Peter Ustinov slated to play Clouseau. The last-minute switch to Peter Sellars spawned some late changes to the film to make Clouseau the primary focus.However, the first hour of the film contains much of the original Niven focus, and is rather plodding, not knowing whether it is supposed to be a drama with a bit of comedy or vice versa. The last hour, however, becomes more Sellars-oriented. It is clear that Clouseau's characacter is a work in progress, with more stumbling than bumbling, but still produces a lot of laughs. The ending is really bizarre and indicates the future of the Pink Panther franchise.While not as good as some of its sequels, it is still a decent start to the series."
3,[Three-and-a-half stars out of five] Followup to A Shot in the Dark - very well done.,"Jewel thief David Niven, father of Kipis back and at odds with Chief Inspec-tor Jacques Clouseau again! Great followupand almost as funny but too many guest ap-pearances to keep up with. This and A Shotin the Dark would have been sufficient butthe franchise tried too hard to milk morelughs out of this Series, after each heartattack Brit. funnyman Sellers had."
3,Suprisingly the weakest of the Pink Panther movies,I have seen all the Pink Panther movies and this (the first and most admired by many) is the weakist one. It's good but nothing compared to the other ones
2,The Pink Panther,"""The Pink Panther"" (1963) Peter sellers, David Niven, Robert WagnerThis film is funny by 1963 standards, but not as wacky as the later Peter Sellers films. Robert wagner is so young in this film that I didn'trecognize him. lots of clumsy comedy moves. Not terribly funny, except for the surprise end. I was laughing at that. That was a good one! Not what you would expect."
2,Slow and Boring,"My wife and I were planning to gather the kids (age 6 - 9) and see a good family movie. I was disappointed to find the movie rather slow and boring. It lacked the hummer Peter Sellers usually brings to the screen. It also lacked any form of thrill or suspense, which could be associated with most robberies."
3,The Pink Panther (original),"This is the original one that set the stage for the sequels. I was mildly disappointed after seeing this for the first time in many years. It's so different from the sequels. It's a great caper film, more subdued than what the series would later become. There are hi-jinx galore, some of it bordering on slapstick. DVD quality is great & there are bonus features; the main one being a trivia track that informs the viewer of many things that go on or went in the movie, a la what AMC used to do on cable."
5,The era is securded,This was the first movie to be shot of the six films. Since this movie has barely any violence in it and only occasional very mild thematic elements in it. This movie should be fine for kids ages 10 to 21 years of age and older. The reasons why I recommend this for ten and up is because the gags used in this comedy movie are the old school slapstick gags that have been used since 1950s and earlier. These old school gags may be to confiscated for kids under the age of ten to understand. The other reasons why I recommend this movie for ages ten and up is there are a few brief scenes thrown into the movie occasionally with the use of Champaign and other alcoholic drinks.. In this movie Inspector Closeau is hot on the trail of a notorious criminal. known as the Phantom. Can the young detective catch this thief who has been dogging the police for twenty years? Find out in the hilarious funny conclusion.
4,still a delight,"A comic gem, the best part of rewatching the first adventure of Inspector Clouseau is not just Peter Sellers but the absolute mastery shown by director Blake Edwards. Very very few comedies can use widescreen competently much less with finesse the way Edwards does here. No wonder they're still making spinoffs and sequels to it even now. Since I'm an Edwards and Sellers fanatic, I'm willing to pay $35 instead of $15 but that's probably too much for most anyone. That's a shame because the film looks smashing. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
1,bad panther,It was apparently a later Peter Sellers 'Panther' after he had had heart problems and did not have the 'slap-stick' type scenes with Kato his houseboy and just was not good or as funny in my opinion as previous 'Panther' movies.
2,Warning! Blu-ray is vertically stretched!,"Someone at the telecine operator at MGM/UA must have been asleep when this gem of a movie was transferred to Blu-ray. Amazon states the aspect ratio as 2.35:1, which is the way this film is supposed to look. But the back of the Blu-ray package says 2.20:1, which is in fact the aspect ratio you get here. But the Technirama system should be 2.35:1, so what is the effect of all this? Well, the image on the Blu-ray has been vertically stretched, so all the actors have thinned - yes even all the famous cars used in the film look thinner than they should. What a pity, as the transfer apart from this mistake looks splendid."
4,"A great film, but as a comedy, worn out slightly.","When I went over to my friend Sam's birthday sleepover, a lot of stuff happened. Everyone teased me because of my height and bad swordsman skills (don't ask), I learned how to play poker, and also, we popped in a movie called THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN.I, intrigued by the film, decided to investigate the series. Two months later, I then bought the boxed set with my allowance. I put in THE PINK PANTHER, and liked it alot. I especially loved Peter Sellers and David Niven's performance. Blake Edwards is the Alfred Hitchcock to comedy. I also loved the title sequence. The humor is focused more on Peter Sellers stupidity. It's sort of one of those movies that are hilarious, yet you never laugh-out-loud.In all, great performances and decent direction make a great comedy.Sincerely,- Ryan Michaels- Fourth-grader- Nine-year old- Further info restricted (requests of the parents)"
4,"Very funny, Peter Sellers is great, a must see once!","This movie was great. I love all the Peter Sellers movies. If you like slapstick comedy, you'll die laughing after this one. Between funny sceens gets boring though. Inspector Clouseau has yet another Pink Panther mystery ahead of him. His trusty man-servent Kato has pre-planned fights between the two which are just plain hillarious. Definitely a comical movie."
5,One of best comedy ever,"I think Pink Panther must be one of the best movie I have ever seen. From it is music to acting it should in the best 100 movie list ever. Especially Peter Sellers is excellent. I should say that he is acting (the dum) so naturally that even when he is standing and looking around he is funny. I have not seen many actors that can be so natural and superb. I should say that David Niven and Claudia Cardinale are superb too. I think eveybody who is interested or not about the movies should watch Pink Panther, at least once in their lifes. Because it is such a classic that not many movies can be as amazing as it. Thank you for eveyone who had worked in making it. And ofcourse thank you Peter Sellers."
5,No one can ever top Peter Sellers version,"Steve Martin should never have tried to remake this movie; it isa classic. Sellers is a great physical commedian and does a fine""French"" accent. Herbert Lom is the perfect foil for the Inspector."
2,pink panther,"Boring , mostly unfunny and silly ending with dumb costume party !sellers just isn't funny at all , supporting cast is better ! only other positive is the wintry landscape in northern italy !"
3,Old and tired.,"In this first of the series, the humor is less than funny and the story line too predictable. Pick one of the later episodes."
3,"Letterbox, Not Anamorphic Format","The 2001 DVD is indeed ""wide screen"", but is letterboxed, rather than anamorphic. This means it loses 25% of the available resolution when viewed on a wide-screen TV.I was also disapointed at the lack of bonus material and commentaries."
3,Better as a self-contained movie,Than as the start of the Panther series. Too many questions arise:1)Where is Chief Inspector Dreyfuss in all this?2)How is Clouseau ever going to be a cop again if he was convicted of diamond theft?3)Where is the former Mrs. Clouseau in Return of the Pink Panther?4)Where is Cato in this film?And many others. Too uneven.
1,Boring,"I just didn't find this funny at all. Niven was in movies that were much funnier. Just wasn't what I expected. In fact, beat me up if you like, but I much prefer Steve Martin's version."
3,can i say boring?,an ok title. wish i could get my money back. hardly one of the better pink panther titles. you only see the inspector for about 20 minutes and he's way to serious. i didnt laugh once. try some of the later titles but stay away from this one.
4,Game meets Game and more GAME,"I had to come back to this book. Once I started to read ""In Due Time"" I could not wait for the narrator to talk to me again. Great story. Great characters and REAL characters. I look forward to more works by Mr Reynard."
3,"When you've recorded 27 albums, not all of them can be great.","I love the Fall. I think Mark E Smith is parts genius and parts total freak! The Fall have the ability to rock out big time, or scare the living hell out of you ( Sometimes all in the same song!). Middle Class revolt has some pretty good songs on it, but it also has quite a few forgetable ones. The fact that it is a double cd does help, by adding a few Peel session recordings as well as original mixes and re mixes of the album. Personally I think Middle Class revolt gets eaten alive by Fall classics like Hex Enduction, This nations saving grace, pretty much anything they recorded in the eighties on the Beggars Banquet label. If you are looking for really cool Fall albums, check out their first two. Live at the Witch Trials and Dragnet.Thanks. Big ""D"""
3,I still love them...,"I bought this album for ""Hey Student!"" reminiscent of their early days. Can't recall the rest of the album. I love them nevertheless."
4,Great Book Great Author,This is the 3rd book in a seris about JD Stanton a retired Naval officer who always ends up in differnt situations. All of the books stand alone but I recommend reading all of them. This is not the Best in the series but is still a great read.
4,Out of Time...,"I really enjoyed this book. I'm not big on the whole 'Christian Fiction' thing, but there was absolutely no preaching in this book. The pages go by pretty fast once the HMS Archer comes into play. I will say the beginning did lag a bit, but it was necessary for character build-up. I love Naval history books, and this was pretty interesting, as well as suspenseful. I will definitely read this authors works again."
1,a big disappointment,"I ordered one for my HC40, but when I installed it the light was facing me, not the subject! I phoned Sony and after a long runaround they told me the light was supposed to be compatible so it must be defective. They recommended I return it. It sounds like just what I need, but I'm afraid if I order another one I'll have the same problem."
4,"Great monitor, a bit more expensive than competitors","Pro: Great monitor, bright, high contrastCon: zeroThis is a great monitor. Really bright and high contrast. The price tag is considerably higher than competiting products. Yet, it's a Sony.I'd give it 5 stars if the price is lower, or, if Sony adds speakers or digital inputs (DVI)."
2,"Good for some, but not for me","I go through my share of cd players. I usually pay a little more and enjoy the extra features. My last was lost. I received this Sony model as a gift. Its a lower priced model, and based on the length of the headphone cord (short) I think this item is for kids. The unit performed ok for the first couple months of use. I run with the unit, and now it skips constantly and it will mysteriously stop mid-song leaving the display of the nnumber song, and the disc spinning, but no sound. Odd. The volume is locking now, the sound was never great.I put the unit through its paces. It can't hold up with my usage, but for someone who's needs are not athletic the quality of this unit may suffice.I've owned Sony cd players and like their features and sound usually, this is a lower end item that I am not accustomed to owning,"
4,Solved my problem,"The DSJ15 has solved my problem of listening to library books on CD while walking my dog. My old portable CD player skipped so much that it was useless. This sports CD player DOES NOT SKIP. I especially like the feature that it starts up where you left off listening, as long as the disk is not removed from the player. I would give it 5 stars except that it is quite heavy and the battery compartment is under the disk, making it very difficult to change batteries while walking.A word of praise about the seller, merchandise. The first DSJ15 that I received from him did not work. I telephoned merchandise and left a message. He replied promptly that he would send out another one and a return mailer for the first one. The second player arrived shortly afterward and works very well. It is a refurbished model, pristine in condition, and includes great headphones, an AC adapter, and an instruction manual. I would rate the service 5-star.I wish Sony would start making these again."
5,What it takes...,"I got this player for christmas the year it came out. From there it's traveled with me through high school, college, hawai'i and many other places, hundreds maybe thousands of miles running in 20 degrees to 100 degree weather. It has fallen down stairs, been kicked, packed, squished, hit and submerged in freak pacific ocean waves, sleet, rain, hail. It's been up many 4k-footers of the northeast, and remains to have excellent playback and most importantly volume.It is heavy, it's controls are tough to negotiate with soggy conditions.The jack finally called it quits this summer (2010), and I'm about to buy another because truthfully, no other electronic device for music playback have I seen that could endure this type of punishment. Sony should take a look at this design for future devices!"
5,"By far, the most interesting biography I've ever read","At first, this biography on Damon Runyon seems like any other biography: a list of dates, names, people, and places. As you start reading it, though, it becomes a story that puts you right in the middle of Runyon's life, the good and the bad. You'll see Runyon's start in poetry, sportswriting, war reporting, and what he is most well-known for: his short stories. Also, you'll see the people in Runyon's life who he based some of his most Runyonesque characters on, and people who based their lives off of his characters. This book reads more like a Runyonesque story than a biography, which makes it so interesting to read, besides the fact that it gives a glimpse into the life of the very private Damon Runyon."
3,Good but not great.,"I got a good deal on this book from amazon, and I read most of it because I'm from Long Island, the town next to Breslin's home in Baldwin.The writing is excellent, done in the style of Runyon himself. But after a while it gets silly, because many episodes are ridiculous and obviously false. Maybe that's the way that Runyon wrote (?)"
4,"Brutal, Interesting, Readable","This book uses the concise Ballantine's combination of readable prose and graphic photo's to describe the brutal battle for Tarawa in 1943. As the author shows, the Japanese had fortified the island, and the assaulting U.S. Marines suffered heavy casualties on the beaches from defensive preparations and errors in planning and execution. Readers see that the U.S. soon prevailed, but at a cost of heavy caualties for both sides. We also see how later U.S. island-hopping used better planning, while Japanese defenders often retreated inland to avoid the heavy bombardment of the beaches. I'd have liked a bit more information on landing craft, but the book takes an effective look at a brutal battle."
3,Recycled,"Made in UK in 2001, Serial# 544-451-2, Playing Time 74:23This is probably the 10th compilation of LS to come out in the last few years. Like most (but not all), this one offers nothing unusual.Lifting tracks from their early albums (up to ""Street Survivors""), this album has lost 2 stars, 1 for each of the following reasons:1) for mis-representing its content (this is NOT Amazon.com's fault: they just list what's on the back panel of the CD): tracks 2,3 and 8, listed as ""original versions"" (i.e. the MUSCLE SHOALS sessions) are in fact the regular album versions; if you want the older versions, buy the ""Skynyrd's First"" CD on MCA.2) for including some of their more ""off-side"" tracks, like ""I'm A Country Boy"", ""Honky Tonk Night Time Man"" and ""Railroad Song"".Even though the disc is packed with music, some of that stuff could have been (easily!) left out to include other classics (like ""Freebird"", ""Double Trouble"" or ""You Got That Right"") of that vintage era."
3,a rugged piece of equipment,While this controller wasn't compatible with several of my motorcycle-based games it does appear to be constructed from quality materials and works as advertised. Economical and good value for the $$$ paid. A good addition to my arsenal.
2,Dead dad inhabits inanimate object.,"If you can make it through ""Jack Frost"" with Michael Keaton, then you can make it through this. Nothing really stands out as being great, but it's a cute flick and my 4 year old liked it."
5,"Great for kids (and grownups, too)",My 6 year old son still watches these disks over and over. He memorizes some of the dialog and constantly asks questions (How many parts are in pickup truck?). We also have Seasons 1 and 3 - they are all great.
2,"Good story, but jumpy and bad editing.","The five star review convinced me to purchase this one. It sounded rad! Too bad the one star did not show up until too late. I might have reconsidered buying it. I gave it an extra star for the plot line.I noticed the name jumping too. But I figured he was trying to throw the bad guy off. I found out that it was not the case. The names were wrong. Oh well.I did not like that the book was left open for a second book to be made. I do not like to feel left dangling. There was nothing to suggest that this book was part of a duo or a trilogy or a series. If there had been, I would have put it aside until the others came out. But it probably a good thing for me. By reading this one now, I won't bother buying any more. Still...the plot IS great. But all the bad editting is wack."
5,YEA YEA,The Yankee is the work horse of my fleet. Well over 25 high alt launches and never a problem. A truly amazing rocket
2,Unwise purchase,"I didn't like this movie, it is done in low budget setting and drags on without being entertaining at all. I don't recommend purchasing this product. I did and am stuck with it."
4,Lil' Hunter Girls Review,This is an awesome game. My daughter who is 11 loves to play this game in the car while going on trips. Our whole family loves the outdoors and loves to hunt!!!
3,Retreat From Leningrad,"If you are a military historian or a student of military tactics this may be the book for you. If you are, as I am, interested in the trials and tribulations of the average German or Russian soldier forget it. Nothing but page after page of tactical material with sparse maps and no photos. Right from the beginning author tends to denigrate the Russian effort and laud the German defense. Good for bedtime reading if you suffer from insomnia. I grugingly gave it three stars because of the effort made by the author to accurately portray the military tactis of the rettreat"
2,I am extremely p#$$&d o%% at this company,"I would've given this dvd five stars. The guy really knows what he's doing and the music and content is great. I have nothing against Steve Trovato, he's great. HOWEVER, lickLIBRARY is unbelievably CHEAP! They DON'T supply TAB and the DVD plays on my computer, which I use to practice on, WITHOUT a menu button in the player. I've tried several players and they are all the same. HOW CHEAP CAN YOU POSSIBLY BE! Without the tab I have to strain my eyes and constantly stop and replay the DVD to see what his fingers are actually doing. He says what he's doing on the DVD but tab notation would make it SOOOOO MUCH EASIER! AND DON'T LOOK FOR IT ON THEIR WEBSITE EITHER. IT'S NOT THERE! At least as of this posting. Sorry lickLIBRARY, I had high hopes for you guys, but you blew it. I'll look for Steve Trovato at other publishers. You guys stink."
5,Sorceress,This is an excellent movie. I saw it years ago and have been trying to find a copy of it ever since. The French version (with English subtitles) is much better than the English version.
4,Drive Medical walker,"Drive Medical 10208PSGR-1 Go-Lite Rollator Green with Padded Seat, GreenIt is so hard to find a quality walker,online, sight unseen. I took a chance (because I had purchased other Drive Medical things) and purchased this walker. It is great! It has large wheels, a fairly comfortable seat, and the color is MARVELOUS. You don't see green walkers often, which is my sisters favorite color. It is a bit heavy for her to put in and out of the car,being she is on oxygen and such, but doable. It was a well priced, sturdy walker, not all the bells and whistles, but for the price, it was a good buy."
5,A lucid essay on the renaissance,"This is an excellent introduction to the development of renaissance art. The book begins by examining the religio-cultural origins of the Italian renaissance in the 13th and 14th centuries. It then travels through Italy, encompassing the movement in Florence, Venice and Rome, examining the reasons behind artistic developments through the artists and their sometimes notorious employers. The tone is lively and witty throughout and never less than intelligent. The author clearly has a great reverence for his subject and conveys this love throughout without ever becoming overly sentimental. The photographic reproduction of the artworks discussed is also superb and unlike many books definitely follows the text so thereader has no difficulty following the arguments that Graham-Dixon puts forward. Well worth reading"
4,Exceptional tool,"This is a compact, powerful and capable driver. If you need an impact driver for construction or DIY'er projects, you can't go wrong with this unit. It's size and strength give it broad versatility. It's a phenomenon."
3,Function cart for the handy-person........,"This cart is nice when finally put together, but comesin a lot of pieces. I had to disassemble part of it and re-do it, as it was wobbly. When I went to use it, I found that a lot of soda on the bottom just did not work................too heavy for the cart."
5,"Nice, Sturdy Laundry Cart","Great quality & not cheap looking. Shelves were adjustable so I put a trash can on the bottom for lint, etc. Shelves were reversible so items could slip right off or have a stop ledge-whichever I wanted. Skinny to fit between washer & dryer, but wide enough for detergent. Perfect!"
3,laundry cart,"I ordered this laundry cart, and received it a couple days later.It was exactly what I wanted it. Very pleased."
1,Don't Buy It,"It looks nice -if only you could put it together. The ""sleeves"" to hold the shelves do not work. Either you can't get the shelf to slide onto the sleeve or the sleeve slides down the pole. Returning it or if too expensive to ship back dumping it at the thrift store. For nearly $40 you should get a product that actually works."
4,laundry products,"great for narrow space, solid -have 3 gallons of soap, 1 of bleach, fabric softener and sheets, and vacumn bags and 1/2 gallon of another soap. holds the weight no problem, well built. rolls out well, easy to assemble. no c/o"
5,Perfect!,"I needed a solution to getting all my laundry products off my dryer (what a mess!). I made the big mistake of ordering an organizer much like this one but made of basically thick cardboard. (I did not order it from Amazon). If it hadn't fallen apart while being put together, it would have been useless anyway -- it would never be strong enough to hold laundry products. So in frustration I came to Amazon, saw this metal organizer, ordered it and am so pleased!!! It's great quality and holds everything. No more mess!"
4,Well built. Needs a handle.,I purchased this for a tight space in our laundry room. It holds a lot of products and pretty heavy items at that. The only thing I wish it had was a handle at one end to make it easier to pull out.
5,great product,I purchased this to go between my washer and dryer. It is perfect and does exactly what I wanted it to. I thought the price was great too! It is sturdier than ones I had seen at the store.
5,Laundry Cart,I love this Laundry Cart because its very study and holds all my laundry supplies. It was very easy to assemble and was ready to use.
2,Vey Unstable,"The product would be just what i needed if it was more stable. But, after following the directions, the product is still extremely shaky and unstable."
3,"Looks OK, not high quality",Looks OK; however one leg is shorter than rest and makes cart unlevel. Spent over an hour trying to level the legs to no avail.
2,Old junk. Never liked Ormandy and his band,"This is rushed, out of balance, and um... how shall I put it... well, nicht zusammen, believe it or not. Winds slightly out of tune now and then. This video is from 1977, so the sound is defective as well: trebly and tinny. I'd live with it if the performance were good, but it's quite lousy, actually. The worst performance of both pieces I've ever heard. Give it a pass -- or, if you must hear it, rent before buying: I bet you'll forego the purchase. (PS. Ignore the five-star reviewers here: I suspect at least some of them are hired drones retyping liner notes to attach something to their contractually obligatory five stars.)"
1,Poor Kristine...,"I expected a lot from this Remix E.P. I hated the original but thought that both Johnny Vicious and Junior Vasquez would turn it into fantastic club anthems. I was wrong. Mixes are the same, just longer. ..."
1,Definition of a failure,"I'm so glad I bought -Lovin' You-. This CD became my reference as the worst record i own. Don't get me wrong,I possess K.W.'s complete discography, albums, singles, ... and this one is a total disaster. ...."
1,"Dreary, disappointing disaster from the ex-house diva","""Lovin' You"" proves that Kristine lost her talent.Where's the originality of gems like ""feel what you want"" or ""Land of the leaving""? Just bad remixes of a terrible track without feelings, empty.This CD is an insult to all serious house/garage lovers.I think ""Lovin' you"" should be called dust because that's what it's going to collect."
2,Melodramatic and Overblown.....a bit silly.,"I am 37 years old, and owned the original vinyl edition of this album. I used to think then that this was one of the greatest albums I'd ever heard. (EGAD!) Thank God my taste has matured since High School! While the production qualities of this recording are quite good, and the harmonies interesting, the lyrics are too often trite and ridiculous - melodramatic posturing - 70s 'corporate rock' at its worst. It's actually a bit embarassing to listen to this now and remember thinking it was great stuff. In retrospect, I think this recording is notable more than anything for its embodiment of everything that was wrong with much of the mainstream rock of the late 70's."
2,If You have Taste - Stay Away,"These turkeys were riding the ""super-group"" wave of the '70's. There's a hint or two of creativeness here, but unless you're wanting to relive the past, pass this one up."
1,"This ""theater"" is closed","""Rolling Stone"" called Styx the cheesiest band of the 1970s. I agree with them. Do what's necessary to avoid this album. It is truly bad."
5,AWESOME,"This is the best album by any rock band any time ever in history. Well flowing, well thought out. It flows just like a book."
5,a classic 'album',"I used to listen to this when it first came off the presses. The CD is great, tho i do miss the 'pops' from my old turntable. This is a great addition to any 80's collection."
4,Number 10,"After the disappointing 'Cornerstone' I was a little nervous about buying this. Didn't want to be let down. But, to my surprise, a very solid release. Almost a concept album of sorts with a common theme of the Paradise Theater. Once again, DeYoung delivers his radio friendly 'The Best of Times', but also delivers the rocking 'Rockin' the Paradise'. Two songs basically the same musically, just a little twist thrown in on the styling. Shaw gives us 'Too Much Time on My Hands', still playing on top 40 today. The only song that never really fit into the album and maybe could be considered filler would be Shaw's 'She Cares'. As much as he would say about DeYoung's songs later on this was a pretty sappy song from him. At least today on cd you can just skip it or just not include it in your mix. But then again, maybe you're one of the fans that likes it. Your choice, but a great album to hear especially after their last."
5,One of Styx's best albums,"When ""Paradise Theater"" came out,eveyone was talking about this fantastic new record.I seen Styx in concert when they were touring during this time,and it was one of the greatest show's ever. When Tommy Shaw came out in the audience playing Guitar,it was wild.If you have the album of ""Paradise Theater,"" play the song ""SnowBlind"" backwards. The word,""Snowblind"" says something about the satan.""Too much time on my hands,"" was a huge hit,along with ""The Best of Times."" I have alot of Styx's records,but ""Paradise Theater"" is my favorite."
4,"Not quite ""Paradise,"" but still pretty good","This is the best Syx album since ""Grand Illusion,"" and contains most of the elements that made the band popular. Guitarist Tommy Shaw's unemployment anthem ""Too Much Time on My Hands,"" is the best song he's written an one of the band's best hits. Even schmaltzy keyboardist Dennis DeYoung comes up with a listenable ballad with ""The Best of Times."" By the early 1980s, Styx was starting to fight against the trends that were taking rock'n'roll in new directions. In that regard, this album was a holding action. It is also their last good album."
1,you buy the 45,& you leave the cd the only great song is best of times by dennis top40 in 1980 rest of it jusy riff guitars inept bass & drum sounds
4,The Last Great Styx Album,"I can still remember getting this album on vinyl when I was in 7th grade! Too Much Time On My Hands and Best Of Times became the big hits off the album, but I always preferred other songs like the haunting Snowblind with James Young and Tommy Shaw on vocals or the rocking Half-Penny Two-Penny with its great guitar solo. My other favorite tracks are Rocking The Paradise and the two short pieces that open and close the album, A.D. 1928 and A.D 1958. Unfortunately the next album, Kilroy Was Here, was a letdown and the band would soon break up. I highly recommend the DVD Styx - Return To Paradise (1996). The band sounds fantastic!"
3,A Lost Book,"I started reading this book when I was around seven or eight. For the record, I am now thirteen and will be fourteen in a little less than two months. I absolutely fell in love with this book when I found it on a book shelf in my first grade classroom. While I am sure older readers will fail to appreciate the wonders this book has to offer, for a beginning reader like I was, it is a treasure that paints a picture in your mind of how the story plays out; never mind a lack of description or reality. Unfortunately, I never was able to finish this book, for it was stolen from my cubby hole before I was even halfway through, and I could never find it in any library so that I might finish it. However, from what I read that I can remember, it's the perfect book for the first grader in us all. And now that I have found it here, I am sure I will order it someday soon, and get re-aquainted with the first grader in me."
1,"Was not the book I was looking for, and didn't say the eddition","This was not the right book I was looking for, So I sent it back."
2,"OK stuff, right price",Needs very powerful ground loop isolator unless you don't care about hearing your engine through the speakers
3,"IT WORKS, OK","I purchased this specifically to puree rasberries, but the wooden pin that is suppose to roll around on the inside of the sieve, gets bogged down by the rasberries. Plus the sieve mesh is not small enough to retain all the seeds, so I have to drain the puree again through a smaller weave sieve to get all the seeds out. The reason I rated it a 3, is because it didn't work great for what I intended it for, but it may work well for other items."
1,Useless,"Out of the box, the roller did not even come within a 1/2 inch of the seive, so it could not mill anything. After I bent it back into shape, I tried to mill a very soft mix of cooked carrots, onions, potatoes, and corn. Round and round went I fruitlessly for half an hour. This mill cannot mill food! You just end up with a pile of unmilled vegetables on one side of the supposed scraper, which spill over the edges of the sieve into the bowl where you are trying to collect the puree, which of course would ruin the puree, if there were any."
4,Hold your breath,"Suspenseful from start to finish, Mr. Drexler snatches the reader's attention with his new release, ""Casualty of Duty"". In the middle of a Presidential election, corruption, greed, and murder become household names. If you are a lover of politics and history, this is a must read."
2,stereotypical,"this is the kind of mindless violent idiocy that people who have never played videogames think all videogames are like.how crappy is this game? let me count the ways. it is crappy in the way it's a third person shooter and weapons automatically lock on. it has crappy camera positioning. the animation is jerky, and looks like something for nintendo 64, not xbox. anderton's face is a mask of brutality.the premise is cool, the way you can throw someone through a plate glass window is cool (but the execution is nowhere near as nice as spiderman), and the heat-wave effects in the stun weapon is cool. all that adds up to is about 1 hour of basic training and gameplay and then utter disgust."
4,Great with cheats,"The cheats make for one of the funniest games I've ever played. Countless hours spent playing this one with cheats. Admittedly, playing through the game normally doesn't have much replayability, and the graphics do look kinda like n64 graphics, but I could easily overlook all of that because of the value the codes add."
3,Slow to Start,"This book was a VERY slow read at first; in fact this is my 2nd time putting it down entirely and restarting it months later. I don't think I got past page 60 the last time around. However, this time I was able to get through the book and it turned out to be a decent read with a strong plot and even stronger moral lesson."
3,It was alright,"I like the whole sixties concept but it needed some energy this book seemed to be so slow, yet it had good parts to butI wouldn't suggest you rush to the store to get it it's not that wonderful."
3,"""TEMPEST RISING"" and falling and ""RISING"" and falling and...","TEMPEST RISING didn't hold or keep the pace as well as TUMBLING, but it made for a good story. The true stars were Ramona and Mae. There was enough tension between these two to light a christmas tree. Shern, Victoria, and Bliss' story was interesting, but with out the aunts and uncles, it wouldn't have carried much weight for me. Ramona and Mae had a relationship built on resentment, but once the background story kicked in, everything was understood. The ending didn't satisfy me, especially with Mae's treatment of her daughter, but I guess I couldn't have everything. A good filler for slow times."
3,A good read,"I enjoyed reading Tempest Rising, but I thought the ending left you out there somewhere. There were very touching scenes throughout the book, you could feel the pain the characters were going through."
3,Predictable,"Talk about a predictable ending! Well, I've got a better one:Clarise is walking through the snow to her house when Ramona and her boyfriend spot her. They get to her house just as the aunts and uncles are returning from Mae's. Five seconds later, a cab drives up with the girls in it (Mister has paid their fare). After the big, tearful reunion on the front lawn, they proceed to go inside the house when the aroma of freshly baked brownies is detected. At that moment, Finch swings open the door and says, ""Where have you guys been, the brownies are ready! """
3,"Good, but not her best...","I found this book harder to read than her latest, _Blues Dancing_. Toward the middle of the novel, I almost thought she lost inspiration or just a certain flair she has with plot lines. I got bored and hurried to the end to get it over with. I still fell in love with her language and ease of setting an atmosphere such that I felt present in the novel. I recommend, but not highly."
2,When does it start?,"I was thoroughly unimpressed with this book. The only fully developed character in the book was Ramona, and thus the 2nd star. I liked Tumbling a lot, I don't know what happened to the writer's voice on this one. Better luck next time."
4,"Not as compelling as Tumbling, but still great reading!!","Although I did not enjoy this book as much as Ms. McKinney-Whetstone's previous writing (Tumbling), this book was very interesting. I have to agree with another review, however, regarding the ending. I too want to know what happened to the aunts, uncles, etc. The romantic in me was also hoping for a resurrection of Finch. Oh well, we can't have everything. None the less, I look forward to Diane McKinney-Whetstone's next book!"
4,Enjoyable!!,"In Tempest Rising, my sympathy were with the three sisters, Bliss, Victoria and Shern. However, Mae and Ramona both had problems that they had to deal with. Although, I enjoyed reading Tempest Rising, I believe Whetstone's ""Tumbling"" was better. However, I will continue to read Whetstone's work."
4,WRITING: 10 - STORYLINE: 7,No doubt Ms. Mckinney-Whestone is one of the most prolific masters of the written word I've read in a while...but sometimes a better story can be had with a clearer focus and I think Tempest Rising started out wonderfully but like another reader I wanted a little more of some and a little less of the other. And maybe I missed something but was the children's father really dead or was he Mister?
5,Bill Engvall Decade of Laughs,"This is a great CD for any Bill Engvall fan. All of his best routines are here. I have listened to this album over and over and I still laugh at the lines. If you want to perk up your day, listen to this CD."
3,No es el mejor trabajo de Bayo,"Definitivamente, la gran soprano española Maria Bayo ha dado un paso atras en su limpia carrera discografica, con este trabajo donde presenta una seleccion de arias de Rossini con suma correccion (lejos del excelso nivel de sus otros trabajos), y con algun que otro preocupante fallo técnico (tendencia a calar, graves poco consistentes...) En resumen, yo esperaba mucho mas de este disco por parte de Bayo.Tampoco parece que sea Concerto Italiano la orquesta adecuada para este repertorio, los instrumentos de epoca desafinan aqui mas de lo debido, lo que desluce la grabacion.La direccion de Rinaldo Alesandrini es lo mejor de un disco que solo es apto para fans de Bayo, o para aquellos que aun no conozcan el aria de Rosina tras la tormenta en 'El barbero de Sevilla', que Bayo recupera para el disco aquí, bastante bien interpretada."
4,Slumberjack Latitude-20F,"My son was planning a winter camping trip to Yellowstone and needed a sleeping bag to keep warm at night. I purchased this sleeping bag because of the ad to stay warm at -20F and the price. I was very impressed with the sleeping bag when it arrived, and my son said that he stayed nice and warm and toasty."
2,Not bad for the price,"I would not rate this at -20 F. I slept in 33'F right after I received it, and I got cold feet and cold in the sleeping bag. I did not have socks on, and I was wearing a t-shirt only; however, I would expected to stay warmer at the temperature rating. Additionally, the stuff bag is much too small for the sleeping bag. I have tried rolling this bag as tight as I can get it, but it doesn't fit in the stuff bag."
5,GREAT CD!!!,I love this CD!! It has songs from each of Billy Ray's previous Cds!! A CD sampler! I love all the songs on here!! A must have for any BRC Fan!!!
2,good support but they run small,"I was looking for a sneaker with excellent support for impact and a different look. These sneakers feel like they have good shock abaorption but run small. I had to pay to return them, did want to go through the exhange game, and refund not received yet (about 2-weeks post return date). After a month I did receive my refund."
4,Great Bib - Thought I was getting 2,"Nice size, very attractive. I thought I was getting two bibs just based on the picture. I should have read the description more carefully. I would buy more of these bibs, though. These won't stain due to the plastic covering and seem to be of better quality than most bibs like this."
3,Microsoft Excel Inside Out Version 2002,"The book is a rehash of the authors' 1999 publication ""Running Microsoft Excel 2000."" Both books have the same problem, i.e. a lack of comprehensive examples. Of the two, this book is only slightly better. Some of the examples appear to be extracted from the Help file rather than providing additional needed information.Also, for someone learning or attempting to advance in Excel, neither of these books follow the [helpful] format of the rudimentary ""Step by Step Microsoft"" books that include, in the margins, pictures of the buttons. These give the relative novice potentially quick aid in navigating the system."
2,Mediocre memoir,I'm not sure who this book was intended for. Entitled Bermudians? And of what age? I was not impressed with the writing or the photos.
3,Stoney Point Steady Stix,The sticks are fine but the rubber handle is poorly designed. Tears easily and does not stay in place I am constantly having to move it back up to the top of the sticks. I feel that the rubber handle sliding arround makes the Steady Stix not so steady ;-) but they will get the job done a time or two
2,product design flaw,This rubber mounts which should support the weight of the gun one would set on the sticks slips under the weight of the gun. Had to use duct tape to provide more friction / stop the rubber mounts from sliding all the way down the length of the poles. Questionable design flaw.
2,Not as described.,"The book I ordered was described as good, but I would only describe it as fair. It had a damaged cover and several pages within in the book were scribbled on with a pen. I did get the book for cheap, but it was not described accurately."
5,Shakespeare review,This book is a handy review of three of Shakespeare's plays. Bantam editions are particularly useful because of the convenient placing of the explanatory text at the bottom of each page. Shakepeare's text is very rich indeed. But the text is so rich that it is very helpful to have notes at the bottom of each page.
2,oh no not again,"between ritchie blackmore going mideival and rick derringer going elevator music i am about to rip my hair out! it's not that this isn't well done because it is but what is the point. these are songs that could be done just as well by any studio jazz musician. rick you need to ask your wife for your manhood back and start running your own career again, remember it's rock and blues that made your reputation my friend. quit crapping on your fans!"
4,Something Different from Rick,"Those of us who are used to kick-butt rock from Mr. D may be iniatially turned off by this recording, but listen carefully, the wonderful fretboard work is there, just toned down a bit. This is a beautiful recording, maybe a mis-step or two, but overall splendid music....plus it's the first Derringer recording my wife actually likes!"
3,"smooth, but I like a little more crunchy stuff","rick is a great guitar player who probably will never get his due, but he is legendary. I am not a lover of JAZZ but this is an interesting interpretation of his music. its a disc to get mellow with and have sex to. I am a rocker and blues kind of guy but when you are fan of someone--you just have to have it all. it just shows how versatile he is and he is not just a ""one"" kind of guitar player. I blasted this release when it was first came out but I was in a kind of mindset that was wrong. do I love this stuff?--no, but I do repect it!!!!!--this is a revamped review of this cd and the other has been deleted."
2,smooth jazz,"the vendor did a fine job, but this music is not what I expected from this artist. I was expecting some good old rockin boogie and instead heard some very tepid jazz. If you are looking for some flacid drone, this record is it..."
5,"Guitar Master Goes ""SMOOTH""","I first heard Free Ride on WQCD-FM in NY and instantly loved""Jazzy Koo"". Superb playing from a guitar great. I just bought Free Ride, and it is a fantastic disc. I am a guitar player andsmooth jazz guitar fanatic. Free Ride is a testimony to Rick'sexpert playing/arranging. The solo on ""Good 2 Go"" is outstanding.This is one disc I just keep playing over and over.""Free Ride"" and ""Hot & Cool"" are a few of my favorite tracks."
5,Extremely Fascinating and Informative Book,"As I read through this book, I realized that biological warfare is a subject that needs to be understood by more people. We all live our day-to-day lives oblivious to the evils other countries are conjuring up. I think this book is a must read because people need to be aware of such subjects as biological weapons. I would recommend this book for anyone who can take it seriously, yet not become paranoid with the new-found information."
2,Stick to journalism Richard,"The technical details were interesting, particularly about the nature of the virus & its effects on the human body. A high gross-out rating if you like that stuff (I do). Unfortunately, the plot was stupid and predictable. The characters were paper thin and uninteresting. Some authors have a great feeling for people and human nature. Some don't. Preston definately falls into the latter category."
4,"Good suspense, with a few first-novel mistakes","A fast and very good suspense read, and the nonexpert can learn a few things. What prevented this from being a full five stars is (a) the author's tendency to interrupt the story with silly explanations (""A knish is...""); (b) excessive reliance on serendipitous coincidences that accelerated the plot, but got in the way of believability (two involving the tracing of the murder weapon alone); (c) a theme that became hackneyed decades ago."
3,"Well paced, credible, and horrifying....","This review is for those people in the buying public who, like me, might find this book a bit over-the-top. No offence meant to the book by that, it's intended to be shocking. By very virtue of its topic matter, it is going to be a difficult read at times. It might not be for everyone though, so do remember to read the pages on offer. Apart from that, I have only to mention that the book is paced well, the characterisation isn't perfect, but I have read a lot worse, and it's written quite satisfactorily, with a lot of good plot elements to keep the pages turning.If you like the intro pages, you will like the book."
2,Had high hopes,"I had high hopes for this novel, after finishing Micro that was written by Michael Chrichton and finished by Richard Preston after Chrichton's death. The premise of the plot seemed promising, but it just didn't pan out. The characters were flat, with very little description. The climax of the plot was overly contrived--I felt like I'd just wasted several hours of reading only to be highly disappointed. I hope someone else takes on the bioterrorism/genetic modification theme and writes a better story than this one."
4,THOUGHT PROVOKING,"I have read other books by this author and enjoyed them more. Nevertheless, biological engineering, weapons, and covert operations send a chill up the spine. In my opinion the beginning was rather weak, with the action jumping to several scenes. The ending was much better with the villian getting burned with his own fire and the haunting possibility that the deadly virus is still on the loose. The manufacture processes, laboratory descriptions, and the research seemed to be overdone. I found some of the background data tedious. It was if the author had found materials that he wanted to insert because he had it - which to me clouded the plot. I would rather have read much more of the villian including his philosophy, research, reasoning, and techniques. Nevertheless, I would recommend the book as a fascinating read."
3,Fair,"I'm going to make this short and sweet. Stilted dialogue, shallow characters, good plot but Preston doesn't do it justice. I didn't get really interested until the last 5 chapters or so, and most people won't make it that far."
4,TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT!,"It may well be labeled fiction but it's cut too close to home. Everyday, we hear about technology break through. We have very intelligent scientists who devote their lives to discoveries & improvements. Good thing if these discoveries & developments are used to improve everyday lives & to bring good deeds & prosperity to everyone. But what if these developments include something like COBRA which can mass exterminate? It may be used as biological weapons (to protect who from what?) or it may be used as a tool to control population as what Cope may have intended to(do humans have the right to take this to their own hands?). These issues are highly debatable --- whether be it in a moral, ethical, or social view. But why do we do this & what for?"
3,A quick read offering a frightening glimpse of reality.,"Although the plot is forced at times to carry a load of information, this book brings to light a very real danger facing our world today. The characters are a bit shallow and undeveloped, but the detailed science truly makes up for it if that's your thing. The prose is lucid and comprehensible even for non-scientists. Read it, and you'll be seen in public wearing a HEPA mask and washing your hands in bleach!!!"
2,A Disappointment,"After the advent of HIV and Ebola, stories about scary viruses seem to be everywhere. We all remember Outbreak (which was an excellent film) and then the highly acclaimed The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. I was expecting much from this one but it failed to deliver. I got the feeling that Preston was trying to impress me with all the research he has done, but who cares? Sure, there was some nice detective work and a fairly fast-paced ending, but it wasn't enough.I wouldn't be surprised if we were to see this in the movies, the character Littleberry is almost written for Danny Glover."
2,Worry about the scientific trifles.,"It may not be appropriate to expect the author to be knowledgeable as a physician with abundant knowledge on gene technology, experimental medicine, pediatrics, and so forth. He might have assumed that the readers know little about Lesch-Nyhan symdrome, or method of collecting blood from tiny experimental animals, or specimen pretreatment for (electron) microscopes, or clinical biochemistry or whatever. But the assmption is not always true, unfortunately. The readers are always selfish. They always look for perfection even when they are not perfect at all. I cannot recommend ""The Cobra Event"" as a ""medical"" thriller."
4,Good for a Scary Fairy Tale,"The book proved to be thought provoking though a bit ""Hollywoodish"". The plot is a realistic scenario with which ""the powers that be"" are wrestling... domestic bio-terrorism. This book tends to make the picture out to be much worse than it ""really is"". Granted, it is more accurate than Hollywood's ""The Rock"" and its magic chemical agent but it still tends to lean toward the miraculous and overlook a few real world limits.Overall, the plot is one of the more believable that I have read with regards to chemical and bilogical agent warfare. It does, however, have a few issues with which science dweebs such as myself would take issue.In a nutshell, good fiction, bad science text book."
2,Technically perfect but artistically flawed,"Considering Mr. Preston's past efforts with ""The Hot Zone"" I was expecting a can't-put-it-down techno-thriller ala Tom Clancy. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Mr. Preston's journalistic background, which he has put to good use in his previous three books, proved to be a hinderence in this novel. In the first 112 pages(which is as far as I got) I learned more than I ever wanted to know about biological weapons, chemical weapons and the myriad ways to deliver these instruments of mass destruction. What I didn't learn about (and I think this is what kept me from continuing) was enough about the characters to make me care about them. Characterization was, at best, minimal. As much as I respect the gargantuan effort it takes to complete a book, any book, perhaps Mr. Preston's forte is journalism/non-fiction and not novels."
3,a great buildup towards a disappointing finish,"The first 80% of the novel is quite good and a real page-turner, and I do not doubt that the story line is realistic (I'm a grad student in Microbiology). However, the end of the story is contrived and very unsatisfying -- I won't give it away, but it is a 'deus ex machina' sort of ending. Put another way, if 'Silence of the Lambs' had such a plot structure, Hannibal would have been caught and executed, and all would have lived happily ever after -- end of story. Watch '12 Monkeys' instead...."
4,Very scary!,"All to plausible, very graphic, sometimes a bit too graphic but this has the desired effect. It leaves you very scared and believing this could happen. I wanted to stop reading but it kept sweeping me along."
4,IT WAS OK,"I gave this 4 stars because it held my attention. However, I would not say that it is a ""must read."""
4,Graphic in a good way,"This was a fantastic book. Richard Preston did an even better jobe than in the Hot Zone, and wrote a wonderful suspense novel. The graphic scenes that he adds in the book make it very intesting and easy, though not always pleasant, to imagine. The book starts out so well, and doesn't let down, staying interesting and exciting the whole book, as you don't ever know what is going on or who will die next. By using a lot of facts, and doing lots of research on biological weapons, and the such, he was successful in creating a very real life fiction story of some unsuspecting, seemingly unrelated vicims of a horrific crime. It was so real, it makes you really think that it is possible, and could really happen, and with biological warfare on the rise in today's world, seems like a very relevent topic. He even adds a little humor, and emotion to the drama and suspense that makes for an overall good book."
4,SCARY AND TIMELY,"Wow, I was out of breath the whole time I read this. Great story, great research, so timely and shocking. Will really make you think about the possibilities that might face us in these terrorism days!"
4,A Factual Novel,"Richard Preston here does an exemplary job of weaving historical and modern facts into a well written novel. He obviously knows his facts when writing about viruses and hot zones, etc.. Besides being an interesting novel in it's own right, Preston has a lot to say here about epidemiology, forensics, and how autopsies are done. There are descriptions of gruesome, drawn out deaths in this book, and some of this is just sick, sick, sick, but it will keep you turning the pages, fascinating nevertheless. Much of this novel concerns itself with the science of forensics, it is interesting how scientists can gleam information out of what at first glance may seem to be very little evidence, and alone this would make the book worth reading. I took one star off of my rating as the novel seemed to me to start very slowly and it was really only the last one third of it that it got intense, but overall a good solid read."
2,Good Plot but just didn't deliver,"I really liked the premise for this book, but as I got into it, it just felt weak. Although I thought the overall story was interesting, the execution was not compelling. I found myself, many times, getting bored after just a few pages.I know I'm against the opinion of the masses here, but this book just wasn't that much fun to read."
5,awesome,"Preston has a way with words that makes one feel as if they are reading a great book and not a biology manual. the cobra event discusses the spread of a composed virus that makes people cannibalize leading to the total melting of the brain, and they ease with which it moves throusg its vectors to new hosts.The story and characters are full of life and anticipation builds quickly. Alice Austin is a pathologist and it falls into her hands to recognize the cases of similar terryfing deaths. Once she puts her clues together she finds out that its a planned game, and starts to worry about ppl around her catching it....is she next?"
1,An author he's not,"If the book was sold as a technical exercise in biological warefare, then I could accept what was written as well put. However, the book was marketed as a suspense thriller and came off as a documentary. I'm disturbed that the publishing industry used his Hot Zone claim to fame, I did read this as well and recommend it, to sell a novel that comes off as a weakly plotted and poorly developed cast of characters around what should have billed as a fictional documentary. I will admit that the technical details of Cobra were interesting, but I would recommend a library visit before a buy."
3,Stay up late! The ending is llooonnnnnggg.,A very scarey novel on biological warfare. Preston does what he does best... scare the hell out of people. I think my fear of the plot becoming a reality is what kept me riveted. I only wish I knew what was based on fact and what wasn't. Don't start the last half late at night-- it tends to drag on... and on. Altogether a good read though.
4,biological terror,"the cobra event manages to scare you with the cold hard facts of biological warfare.it scares you by telling you that a terrorist can easily wipe out a city the size of new york with a small dose of genetically engeneered virus. After reading this book,you will probably live life more cautious and in fear."
5,facinating thriller with a lot of truth & fact to back it up,"i am a avid reader of virus patholigi and bioterorism books and the one is one of my top three. Richard Preston has done a great deal of reserch that has resulted in this book being not only realy plausable but allso some of the tecnoligi that he mentions are being created. i highly recomend this book to any sci-fi, science or anyone who is interested in a realy good science thriller."
2,"Where fact and fiction mingle, readers are left clueless","With his whopper of a book -- The hot zone, Perston left me disappointed with this next one. He says in the start that some of the things are mentioned are facts, but what is fact and what is fiction is quite a gray area causing me, and probably others to believe things from his fantasy world might be true. Only after I did independent research did I learn that some of the things I was believing were pure fiction. The plot is mediocre with few suspenseful parts. Overall, a disappointment."
3,A Good First Attempt at Fiction,"I read ""The Hot Zone"" when I was on a Business Trip in Corpus Christi Texas and thoroughly enjoyed it. The Cobra Event has a somewhat good meter, but could do better in character development. This, I believe, is due to Mr. Preston's background in Non-fiction. Fiction requires a different technique. He tries but slips at times. In several places in the book he over-uses certain words. Over-all, though, I liked it. I am giving it a 6 because this is his first work of fiction and I believe that Mr. Preston will improve his ""fiction"" skills now that he got his feet wet."
4,Plot=8.5;Character Development=4,"Preston has done quite a job of scaring the bejesus out of the reader with this and his previous ""Hot Zone."" For the forensicly uninitiated, many scenes in this novel are graphic, intense, and quite literally visceral. Unfortunately, Preston has compromised the novel's effectiveness for a draft of a SciFi screen script sans character development. Still, I'm waiting for viral glass lozenges to appear at the HABA counter of my neighborhood druggist."
4,MORE AN EARTH WORM THAN A COBRA!!,"Not as striking as a Cobra! Preston is one of the best describers of technical material I've read but I'm not convinced (yet) that he's a novelist. Great theme and fascinating detail, but held back not so much by shallow characterisation (as other readers have complained) as by boring characters. Some of the descriptive passages are also boring, for example the interminalble passage covering the set up of Governor's Island. The shoot out in the tunnels is cliched to hell (hasn't even Patricia Cornwell done a subway shoot 'em up?)but I didn't mind it so much. Having said all that, I'll still give it a 7 because the subject was fascinating and the author believable"
1,"Disjointed, Hodgepodged, Forced","Just finished the book. It took a bit of doing. This is the first book by Richard Preston that I've read, (I understand that his other books are nonfiction) and as novels go, this one didn't click. The point-of-view could change in mid-paragraph, the subject could suddenly change without letting the reader in on it. I felt like the story could have been more to my liking if it had just been more cohesive."
1,"Not gory, not scary","Despite what others will have you think, this book is neither terribly gory nor scary. The reviewers who thought so are either all terribly wussy, or are used to the tamest fiction imaginable.I'll agree that the *idea* of a virus that could make you eat yourself is frightening. I was expecting it to be better written and much more visceral, based on the reviews. Not impressed."
3,Guilty pleasure for science geeks,"This book is the result of mixing Silence of the Lambs and The Andromeda Strain.It's a nice technothriller, but the writing has some serious rough spots. Given that it's Preston's first fiction book those are somewhat forgivable.It's a guilty pleasure I'd recommend to science geek for some light, very light, reading..."
5,I love this book!,"I loved this book! It was intriguing, I couldn't put it down, and it was scary. It starts with a girl with a bad cold going to school, and she collapses during art class and dies within hours after having seizures and hemorrhaging. A homeless man was also infected, and some medical officials try to diagnose the disease and find a link between the cases. Squeamish people beware: There is a very detailed autopsy part. If you are not squeamish, I recommend this book.Note: Ben's daughter wrote this review."
5,Scariest book of the year,"The book that scared the president, that's all I have to say. A killer virus which is actually a combination of a group of viruses is being released and tested on humans before the huge outbreak ocurs. The victims actually start to eat themselves and have violent convulsions before they break their own backs and die in an arched position. Very vivid and graphic accounts of autopsies and the actual deaths of the victimms. The book is very hard to put down and makes me think twice every time I get pink eye or feel sick of what really could be happening to me."
2,Starts great but slowly bogs down with forensic details,"I was excited to dive into this book and was not disapointed with its gory and dramatic premise. It soon became too much work, however, and the story bogged down into forensic and scientific details that was outright boring. Furthermore, the way in which the villian is captured is just too coincidental."
3,"""Austin and Hopkins Tell You About Science""","Somebody told the author he could sell more books by getting his work published as an Info-Thriller, than as a Current Issues piece.The recipe for success with info-thrillers is: information disguised as a story, high-tech gadgets, and sex. This is what the canny author of many factual Current Issues books did. He re-spun what he knows how to do (I recommend ""American Steel"") into a novel. However, I learned more about: How-to-Cook-a-Bio-Weapon, the Geo-politics and history of biological warfare, FBI police procedures, and epidemiology than ""mans inhumanity to man"" i.e. there was really no story, or sex either.If you want to learn about epidemiology and bio-war in a ""Austin and Hopkins Tell You About Science"" format you'll be happy with this book. If you don't need a tissue thin story draped around this information you might want to read Deshowitz's ""The Malarial Capers"" to get most of the same stuff without the police procedure."
2,One big biological mess.,"It would be wonderful if the FBI and the CDC in Atlanta could work as smoothly together in reality as they do in this book. I found it too strange that the very first case of this newest virus is found almost immediately and suspected of being a biological weapon. This was the second time I have read the book, (hoping to get a little more out of it) and it just doesn't make much of a grade. The ending is a fast paced whirlwind of activity that does not match the rest of the book, and though some of the story does center on the actual human beings contracting this ""virus"", too much of the story is centered on the individual sleuths attempting to solve the puzzle and the mechanics of biological warfare. This aspect of the writing makes the book less of a good read and more of a definition of biological warfare, which can surpass the average layperson so easily that the reader can get lost quickly. Thumbs down, The Hot Zone was so much better."
2,A boring Virus Story,"Richard Preston has no ability to create a story that really keeps the interest of the reader. I love to read about anything and the central point of this book - biological warfare - could offer a great book. But that's not the case of Cobra Event. Extremely gore and galore in some points (like the suicide of Dr. Dudley), dull and heavy in other parts, Cobra Event is a book that neves takes off. Preston has a mamoth style of writing and it doesn't help to lift up the reader expectative!"
2,an ok book if you're into technical details,"I haven't read any of his other books but his writing in this book is driving me nuts. I don't think he should write novels. Some of the sentences he seemed to just throw into the middle of a couple of paragraphs were just stupid, and he makes his scientists look dumb by having one scientist over-explain something to another. Although I must say that I enjoy learning new things and his technical details are what kept me reading this book. The story itself is between mediocre to enjoyable, but again if I haden't been learning some things I didn't know, I may not have finished this book."
5,Ewww!!!! Gross!!!!! My kinda book!!!!!!,I haven't finished the book. Yet. The story's great and I applaud him for his great research. It must have taken a lot. Good reads.
4,An exciting book,"The Cobra Event was an exciting, engrossing novel. If you enjoyed The Hot Zone, then Cobra Event won't let you down. It has a lot of similar stuff: grotesque, in-depth descriptions of autopsies; gory details of viral amplification process; and real-life, jaw dropping, eye-opening information. It's scary reading books like these ... because you know that it might not be fiction one day. I highly recommend this book."
2,"Well-researched, but devoid of any character developement","There's nothing like a gripping thriller that keeps you reading until 4:00 in the morning. Unfortunately, the Cobra Event is not one of them. The setting and storyline are not only plausible, but intriguing. And Preston has done an exceptional job of research. But the characters are never fleshed out beyond their one-dimensional attributes, leaving the reader indifferent to their plight. Most importantly, the villain is given no rational motivation beyond some vague concept of ""overpopulation."" It's hard to believe that anyone (even in a work of fiction) would go to these lengths for a motive so ill-defined."
2,Cobra Event doesn't measure up,"I really looked forward to reading Cobra Event after having read Hot Zone and I am still looking forward to reading First Light. I applaud Richard Preston for the research necessary to write a book of this kind. However, I feel Mr. Preston would do well to stick to non-fiction. Cobra Event bordered at times on being just plain silly."
4,The Cobra Event educates while entertaining.,"The Cobra Event is worthwhile science fiction because of Richard Preston's obvious understanding of science and his ability to communicate about real, cutting-edge scientific activity well enough to educate while entertaining. There also is impressive evidence of real research.On one level, this is the sort of book that ought to be included in high school science courses, because it teaches about science and scientists (as does The Hot Zone) in ways that offer young students a glimpse of what scientific careers are all about. At another level, of course, it's an enlightening illustration of the possibilities today when science goes astray."
4,scarily engrossing,"Made a mistake reading this book at 2am alone in my room coz I couldn't sleep for quite a while after that. Preston's descriptions are scarily graphic and what makes this all the more firghtening is that it actually seems believable. Very interesting, gripping and exciting. Found the ending a little anti-climatic though and the suspense and action were a little lacking."
5,25 years as a EMT didn't prepare me for the Cobra Event.,"The internal workings of the CDC and FBI were most impressive through out the book. The pace is very quick,also the Medical & Law enforcement terms are ""smoothly"" written into this exciting book."
5,Best fictional read of my life,"Amazon just prompted me about this book, undoubtedly due to my pattern of hits. However, I've already read it, continue it recommend to anyone I think might have an interest and am searching for stories even close to its entertainment value. While reading it approximately 5 years ago, I could not put it down and was actually losing sleep. It was as if I were watching a movie, reading as quickly as I could comprehend and picturing the scenes in my head. I had a friend (in the medical field) who could not finish the book due to its gruesome details. But, it's the understanding of that unsettling detail presented earlier in the book that facilitates later comprehension. Buy this book and hang on."
1,Yuck!!!!!!!,"I had to give up on this one!! How anyone could stand reading the autopsy of Kate, I'll never know. It was too much for me. Totally disgusting and boring book!!"
4,"Loved it, but I have a question.","The Cobra Event was a truly engaging page-turner; the book was a thrilling combination of politics, medicine, science, and intrigue. However, I was at a loss to find out what happened to Littleberry. He's described as ""MIA,"" but what happened to him???"
3,"So far, so good...(I'm enjoying it)","The book is down in my car, I am at my desk (where I work). I will read it in the parking lot when I'm off (at the end of my shift).So far the book is very entertaining (enjoyable), but I am getting awfully tired (disenchanted, embittered) of having to read each line twice. The first time when he writes it, and the second time when he explains what he wrote (clairifies the storyline). I graduated high school, do not have a college degree and never cured any diseases, but I am capable of deciphering a string of text (I can follow the english language). My annoyance at his assumption that we just won't ""get it"" (understand, keep pace, follow) unless he spoon feeds (reillustrates, exemplifies) it to us has REALLY detracted from my enjoyment of the book."
3,Good but not great,"I liked it, good story, but not extremely well written. I'd say some of the secondary characters were hard to tell apart because there wasn't really much to them. I would also say that at times the book reads like a textbook rather than a novel; to some extent it's necessary to explain the more technical points in the book. At times the author over simplifies, for example, Preston was explaining that there was a bioweapons lab in the former Soviet Union which had 4000 employees and half of them may have fled to other countries leaving 2000. Okay, so I'm a bookworm and not a math genious, but I don't need simple math explained to me. None of this took away from the good story. Like I said, I liked it and would recommend it, but it wasn't fantastic."
5,engrossing,"Read this book in three sittings which is the best indicator of its engrossing nature. The graphic scenes, while sometimes sickening, were almost necessary to fully bring out the threat posed by biological weapons. Perhaps the most terrifying scene to me was the one in which Hopkins was wedged into the tunnel near the end of the book. To find yourself in such a situation would be truly horrifying. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the book from start to finish."
4,"The Hot Zone was scary, the Cobra Event is TERRIFYING","As a sweep of terror has made it's way through the United States, it becomes that much more vital that people read this fascinating tale of the reality of biological warfare. Despite the fact, that this book is deemed a fictional account, Preston incorporates factual material to add to the horror of what was once thought of as an unrealistic possibility. This book was hard to put down not because of the writing or character development, but because of the staggering data about the sheer volume of ""weapons"" such as Bot-Tox, Smallpox, and other deady viruses that are far too real and brutally gruesome."
3,Enjoyable but lightweight.,"I read this novel after being thrilled by 'The Hot Zone'. Good as parts of the novel are, I think 'The Cobra Event' demonstrates that Preston's talents are best employed in non-fiction. 'The Cobra Event'ultimately failed to engross this reader because the characters were to obviously constructed as engines to drive Preston's point about biological weapons and bioterrorism. Preston never convinced me that these people could exist outside his story (the dialogue, as one other reviewer pointed out, is pretty ordinary). Cliches abound. The last fifty pages, in particular, are almost embarrasing: this is a writer calling out to all Hollywood producers, 'option this book, please'. Since the publication of this novel, Preston has continued to write fascinating articles in the 'New Yorker', some of them on bioterrorism. I hope they form another non-fiction classic soon."
3,Good Story,"I liked this book, however at times I felt it got a little bogged down with the textbook type style. I agree with the other reviewers that Preston tends to over-explain things that are rather easily understandable. Overall, i thought it was a great story and would recommend it."
4,"Interesting, scary tale...","I found this book to be a frightening account of what might happen with biological weapons in ruthless hands. I do feel the author is stronger when writing non fiction, and hope that he returns to it soon."
4,Don't read this book while eating,I had to shelf my lunch when I read about the autopsy(s). A pretty good read!!!
4,Great fiction begins with facts and history.,"That's why this book will scare you to death. It could happen here.My wife is a hospital microbiologist and epidemiologist. The book is being passed rapidly among the staff. The ""peer review"" so far has been excellant.BTW, Preston's non-fiction ""American Steel"" is great. Steel sound boring? Not when Preston writes about it; it reads like a novel."
1,If Only Preston Could Write Fiction,"The Cobra Event had the potential to be a good story but, unfortunately, it lacked an author who could write fiction. While Preston definitely is familiar with all the details about biological warfare, he has virtually no ability to develop and sustain a plot and in creating rich, interesting characters. All of his characters are cardboard-like figures. The publisher would have been more honest in marketing this book as a scientific documentary on biological warfare than as a suspense thriller. Save yourself the time and possible expense and skip The Cobra Event."
2,Interesting premise but the plot falls flat,"The Cobra Event is worth the read (if you don't mind gore or horror) just for the science tidbits behind it, but the characters, plot, and writing style are absolutely nothing to write home about. Preston is a decent non-fiction writer; his writing style works well with non-fiction--the plot is already developed, the characters already exist, and the science is well expressed in the bare facts. (This isn't to suggest that non-fiction writing is easier.) Unfortunately, his efforts for fiction just fall flat. I felt like this book was a stripped down version of what someone else could have written given the premise. Preston should just stick to non-fiction."
4,"Captivating, addictive","Richard Preston has written an excellent book, that is part mystery, part techno-thriller, part drama, while incorporating factual information that increases the plausibility of story for the reader. Complex enough to keep the reader guessing and of appropriate length to tell a great story. While there is decent character developement, the main character is the virus - and some of the information is slightly repetitive about this main character. My only complaint is the overuse of the word 'hot', which is probably due to Preston's 'Hot Zone' overwhelming success. The factual and pseudo-factual information is particulary interesting considering it was written in '97 - prior to recent beliefs and more recent discoveries."
2,Boring,the game is more of the regular racing style its boring if your looking for true rally racing dont buy this one.
4,Waste of Money,"Total waste of money. Great graphics and a wide variety of game modes is really the only thing going for this game. Besides that it's bad sound effects, totally unrealistic game physics, and the worst customize controller setup ever. Four preset controller configurations, and all the legends for the configurations are wrong. Legend says one button does a certain function but when you get into the game the buttons are different. Yes I've tried them all, they are all wrong."
4,Too Funny!,"This will be our next game. Demo came out in PS2 mag. Game play is OK, sound effects a bit iffy (cars sound like they are electric). But the brit navigator is too funny, ""you broke the F'bleep car"". Hopefully will have an adult mode for real cuss words. My wife and I intentionally run into things to infuriate him. Ramming his door into the fence gets him going good. We have so much fun listening to him scream. Oh, if you destroy all the tires the car tends to track better."
1,So far from 'everyday' it's silly,"This is as far from everyday as you could possibly get. Recipes are complex and use gourmet ingredients, not everyday fare. Families watch out, this is not the book for you. A total waste of money for my picky eating child who can't have dairy. P-U - rename this to the GOURMET DAIRY FREE COOKBOOK and it's fine but with this title it's a huge miscue."
1,Every day???? Please!!!!!!!!!!,"I would like to know who eats like this every day and who has the ingrediants in their pantries for these kind of eccentric/lavish meals.I'm really sorry I wasted my money. My husband and I eat meals like this at 5 star restaurants, but don't cook like this daily. We had a good laugh over the title of this cookbook!"
3,where are the extra tracks!,"hey, what gives? Amazon says there should be 2 specific commentaries & an Easter egg on this DVD & the sticker on the box says ""contains 2 or more commentaries"" (whatever that means!), but there's only one commentary on here, by the screenplay's author, not by ""Gibson, Ferrara or the cast."" Does anyone know what happened here?"
3,NEW ROSE HOTEL,"SOME WHAT HARD TO FOLLOW AT FIRST, BUT GOOD FUN. CHRISTOPHER WALKEN IS ALLWAYS GREAT THIS FILM FINDS HIM OUT OF HIS NORM."
3,Love it or hate it mos def. Leaning toward hate it here. :/,Love the cast. Love the author. Def love the genre. Was painful to watch at times. pacing bad. dialog bleh. camera angles annoyed me at times. Happens and glad I didn't pay full price to have experienced this.
1,Awful!,"It's hard to believe Walken and Dafoe wasted their talent on this ""film"" and I use the word film lightly. Half an hour into watching, I had had enough but a friend who expected better things to come compelled me to keep viewing. Not only did better things not come, the movie sunk to further depths of depravity. Not only was the plot miserable, the sound quality was awful and the lighting atrocious. In one scene due to inept lighting you can hardly see the actors because of the darkness shadowing their faces. Mood setting is one thing but obscuring the actors quite another. What a colossal disappointment."
2,Nothing happens,I fell asleep watching this movie. Nothing ever seems to happen. Not much of a plot. A waste of good actors.
3,Hampered by budget,"Obviously this movie was hampered by budget. The director and actors are all top notch. The story is good, but a little short. If they had a bigger budget it could have been superb. Too bad it wasn't picked by hollywood and was done foreign. It's worth watching."
2,Horrid mess,"An unbelievable mess, this incredibly confusing movie makes Ferrara previous ""The Blackout"" a model of narrative clarity. This shoddy movie is one of the reasons that Ferrara has become more and more a marginal figure (his films are now barely released in the US). The reason why actors of the caliber of Dafoe and Walken starred and produced this movie is beyond me. The only thing that makes this movie worth a look are a few nude scenes from the beautiful Asia Argento."
2,The worst screenplay EVER.,"What a waste of talent coming from a cast of (usually) wonderful actors. Walken & Dafoe in endless incoherent banter. The beautiful Asia Argento, who is Italy's most famous actress is miscast in this horrible mess. What a shame! I have seen the work of all these actors but this one is a huge, awful attempt to be artistic. Director Abel Ferara, who has made one of my most favorite movies (like Bad Lieutenant w/ Harvey Keitel) thoroughly dissapoints me in this shoddy piece. Everything is tacky, including the quality of the film. This is by far, the worst movie by a talented director made w/ three awesome actors EVER made. Rent it but do not buy."
3,The Mews,"This is one of my favorite series, but I thought this was a bit of a let-down compared to the other books. I thought that the series ended abruptly, and badly. In the end, it left me frustraited and broke."
3,"Cute, but size is WAY off","Overall, this costume is very cute. However, I ordered the 6-12 month size for my son who will be 9 months old come Halloween and it comes very close to fitting my other son who is almost 3 and average weight/height. Disappointed."
4,Great Costume for our 17 month old.,The costume is perfect if your kid loves George. Lots of people leaving reviews stated it would fit their 2 year old but I don't believe that. Our 17 month old is in the 50th percentile of height and weight and it fits him perfectly. We bought the 6-12 month size so if your kid is 6 months it won't fit. The buttons that snap around the legs and in the back are a bit cheap but for $15 it works. Would definitely purchase again!
3,TOO BIG,"I was very pleased with how fast I recieved the package, but upon opening I found that the costume looked way too big. I bought the 1-6 mo old size for my 8 mo old son. It looks more like a 2T. I will let him try it on today and see if it will fit somewhat. I thought about returning it, but just read the seller's return policy - ""unopened and unused."" So how exactly am I supposed to know if it will fit? I don't think I will be buying from this seller again, unless it has nothing to do with sizes."
2,On Being Pagan,This book seems to be more about what this guy has learned and who he has learned it from then on being pagan. I can honestly say I have learned nothing from this book.
5,Disney goes at it again!,"Disney Sports Snowboarding features the best of the best Disney characters! I'd personally prefer the dynamic duo ""Chip N Dale""! Hit the slopes with Disney on your GBA AND GBA-SP!"
5,outstanding narrative history,"This great narrative history of King Charles' trial and execution (during the English Revolution of the 1640s) sets the standard for readability without sacrificing detailed research. It also has the best discussion of the London popular press of that era that I have read anywhere, including Christopher Hill. This book has been reissued as ""A Coffin for King Charles"" -- look for copies under that title."
4,A mystical mystery,I love how Gena finds her shades in a thrift shop and they turn out to have special powers. The premise of this book excites the imagination. The telling of the story lives up to this promise.
5,GREAT DVD for Rescue Hero fans,"I am so happy they have Rescue Hero DVDs now. My son had most of these episodes on VHS that we bought used, but this is so much better. He loves seeing all they ""guys"" he has in the action figure line on TV and all the episodes teach a lesson. I would rather him watch these DVDs than some of the shows on TV. After watching he then acts out the missions with his toys. It really helps with the imagination. Every Rescue Hero fan should get the DVDs!"
3,A limited look at Fontana's work,"Far from being a retrospective, this book, the catalogue for an exhibition held at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, is centered on two bodies of works that Fontana created as references to the cities of Venice and NY. The illustrations are of a high quality, the text, though not groundbreaking, is interesting, but the problem lies in the quality of the works: no big red or white slashed canvases, no large egg-shaped punctured paintings from the La Fine di Dio series, in short no masterpieces. Of course, this has to do with the restrictive topic of the exhibition, but it is still disappointing, all the more so as very few books on Fontana are available on the market."
2,Don't walk blindly into this light,"I picked up this light a few months back for my Sony VX2000 (which captures both digital and still images). While the range of the light was moderate for video, it worked reasonably well for nearby photos in the dark. It seemed to drain my battery rather quickly. That was to be expected...but it was even faster than I thought before the battery light would start blinking.So after some moderate use at one event, I brought my batteries home and realized they would charge just a little and stop. This thing seemed to KILL my InfoLithium batteries! The workaround I discovered (which I'm not sure it quite works) is to take the light off and turn the camera to VCR mode and play video until the battery REALLY died. Then I'd be able to give the battery a full charge and that seems to return them to normal...pretty much.I'd recommend if you get this light (or any similar) that you try it out with your cheapest battery first to see if you have the same problem."
4,Good carry around flash and video light combo,"Yes, this flash light does drain your battery. That's why you need to use a high capacity battery with this flash. Not sure why the previous reviewer said that this flash messed up his camera battery. I did not experience this problem.If you really want to use this flash unit to full capacity, keep your camcorder plugged in to your AC and don't use your battery. Any light attachement will drain your battery."
2,Where's the rest?,"I love Swingout Sister ever since I was a little girl in Oakland...this cd is missing some of their best songs! Kaleidoscope World is barely represented. I suggest buying 3 or 4 of their cds to have a complete collection. And the Millenium(sp) collection's even worse! I don't have either of their ""Best Of"" cds and I'm glad b/c I'd be very very dissapointed."
3,"Stick with ""It's Better to Travel""","There already is a 'best of' Swing Out Sister: It's calledIt's Better to Travel, their first album. Nothing will ever top it. Every track on it is a winner. I drove that cassette tape into the ground. By comparison, nothing here in this compilation outside of the tracks culled from that debut album will stick with you. It's pleasant enough stuff, but nothing like the catchy hooks from 'Travel' - 20 years on, those tunes stick with you in the most delightful way."
4,Where's Waiting Game?,"How can they release a Best of without including 'Waiting Game'?!! Some of these records companies suck. I'm glad illegal downloading is eating away at their profits, especially when they make such glaring omissions. Karma's a biatch, ain't it?"
2,"Very Disappointing, Not Genuine Hip-Hop, Has Just One Artist, Who Just Talks the Words to the Songs.","I was very disappointed in this so-called ""Hip-Hop"" Tribute to Lynyrd Skynyrd's Greatest Hits. You get only one artist, on all the songs, Stewart Michaels, who just talks the words to the songs, while music plays in the background. It is very mono-tone. What a let-down.If you want some real ""Country/Southern Rock Hip-Hop Rap"", then I highly recommend anything from Colt Ford. Especially ""Live from the Suwannee River Festival""."
1,Defective card+No help from customer support= 1 Star,"I've installed many PC cards but this one gave me trouble. The card is supposed to run with a compliant driver already included with Win XP. It didn't work. I know computers pretty well and knew to try the card in a different slot, visit the website to get any updates, and to uninstall and re-install it a few times but nothing worked. I chalked it up to the card being bad, but before I took it back I wanted some advice from the company's customer service so I visited their website. I e-mailed their customer service and never recieved a reply. The lack of adequate customer support was the final straw. I returned the product to Circuit City and got a refund."
1,"Simple exercise, boring tape",There is only about 20 minutes of good information in the tape pertaining to the back exercise. The rest of the tape is boring and too long.
4,Makes you think...,"I saw this movie because I was a huge fan of the band ""They Might Be Giants."" I must say I was awestruck at the end. It was very powerful and somewhat disturbing. The romantic elements weren't there too much, but the acting was superb and humourous. I heard about the cut-out scene from the supermarket without which the movie made no sense, but I think that the most crucial scene is the scene in the taxi when Gearge C. Scott talks about the fact that ""they might be."" I like this idea. I'm frantically hunting for a text of the play."
5,My favourite film,I love this film its fabulous. It's one of those great movies that hopefully debunks all the set ideas people have about mental health. George C Scott is brilliant. To me its also of the most romantic film ever.
1,They Might Be Giants,This week the movie (complete) is showing on Retroplex. Record it from this cable channel.
3,Decent,"Well, all this movie is about is a guy who thinks he's sherlock holmes and it has George C. Scott. Thats about it."
4,Whimsical and engaging paranoia.,"With Y2K on the horizon, the apocalypse approaching, UFO aliens abducting innocent citizens, and North Korea trying out its nuclear delivery system, we can forget which of these is a real threat and which not. Joanne Woodward, a psychiatrist named Dr. Watson, tries to help George C. Scott, who sees threats all around him. The title metaphor comes from Cervantes, but Conan Doyle provides the major framework. Scott is a former judge who thinks he is Sherlock Holmes, pursuing Moriarty, the epitome of evil. Each step of pursuit through the city shows reality a little differently, wittily, sardonically, poignantly. (Jack Guilford's brief Scarlet Pimpernel is a special gem.) No sex; no violence; just a joyous relief from the ordinary. Unfortunately, the video is still too expensive."
5,"C'est noble, c'est charmant, c'est chevaleresque",This film was amazing. L'essence de la méthode. a Fte Accompli. The essence of method. Un film fabuleux.
3,"Comfy, but not for flat feet...",Comfy but the leather flops are still more comfortable for those with zero to no arches.
2,Rainbow Sandals you Can't go wrong..,"Rainbow are the most comfortable men's sandal, but they were not the right one's that my son wanted. But overall they are a comfortable sandal."
3,They hurt pretty bad at first.,"The first couple times I worn these I thought the skin between my toes was going to cut and bleed. After about a week they became much more comfortable. I thought that these were going to be the best sandals ever, but the are just okay."
3,Little disappointed,"I've worn Rainbows exclusively for about 7-8 years and figured I'd give the hempies a try. At first I really enjoyed the sandal, the feeling of hemp after all of the years of cold leather was, for lack of a better word, comforting. This only issue I had with these was that the hemp material wore down in no time; I reckon it was less than 2 months before my big toes on both feet were breaking down to the next layer. The hemp material also started to gunk-up a bit within a couple uses which left them a bit more unsightly than the leathers (I'm not THAT dirty). If I purchased another pair I would probably just make sure its not my daily sandal."
1,"Eats ink, LCD boke, not cost efficient","People on here shouldn't write a review until they use it for a longer period of time. At my office, in one year (making 14,000 the past year) I've used $1,600.00 worth of ink. I had to replace the Maintenance Kit and also the LCD panel broke. NOT COST EFFICIENT AT ALL! We have about 6 or 7 in our building and are lookign to get rid of all of them, it was a poor, poor choice."
1,HORRIBLE PRINTER,"Was shipped with broken ink cartridges. Amazon refunded. After printing 100 pages, the printer gives an error message of ADD BLACK INK. Black ink is full, Xerox tech support (outsourced to India) was of no help. I am throwing the printer in the trash, if Amazon does not offer a refund."
3,A mixed bag,"This printer produces stunning output and has excellent paper handling. Setup was a breeze. But, it is quite noisy when printing and when it is in standby mode (after overnight, for example) the first page takes 2-3 minutes to print. Also, it is recommended to be left on all the time, and it consumes almost 50 watts in standby mode."
4,Not a good choice for occasional use at home,"I actually like this printer, but the inks - especially the branded Xerox variety - are very expensive. It's more suited to a graphic shop or a busy small enterprise."
5,Xerox Phaser Rocks,Product works great. The pictures are amazing -- glossy photos on plain paper (the solid ink is MUCH better than color laser printers).
5,Have loved it for years!,"Roffler Sculpt Lotion really does hold your hair in place without grease or helmet feeling. I've been using it for years (20+, I think). I don't know how it compares to anything else because i've never had a reason to try anything else. Of course, it has fewer hairs to hold than it did 20 years ago. Nevertheless, it's my favorite."
2,Indy 500 Book,It has alot of history but the Author jumps around from driver to race and back way to much and its very confusing.
3,"Indy:The race and Ritual of the Indy 500, 2nd Edition","I am a true lover of the Indy 500, but this book was a labor to read and made so many incidents run together, that it was hard to hold my interest? There is a tremendous amount of information, but it concentrates on the 4 turns and some of the most spectacular events happened on the straights, i.e. Bill Vukovich (1955) and Eddie Sachs, Dave McDonald (1964) to name two. If you want to know about a critical review of A to Z on the turns, I guess it ""makes the grade"", but one can only take so much information on people you never heard of and I've heard on most!"
5,Another Great book from Emily Hendrickson.,"I can always count on Emily Hendrickson to keep me entertained. I have two dozen of her books and counting. If you are a Georgette Heyer fan, you will lover her books."
2,Won't work with Pandora,Bought to fit on a pandora bracelet. Too small for that. Otherwise it is a nice charm.
1,"Small size, short life","I purchased this device and loved its small size, but it is a little difficult to figure out the correct way to insert it. I loved it while it lasted, but it only lasted a week before it completely died.I kept it on my car key ring and didn't submit it to anything harsher then my pocket so there is no real explanation of why it should crap out so quickly.I will try another device. I don't trust my valuable data to this cheap gizmo."
5,Great movie!,I bought this movie for my son-in-law! He loves the movie and wanted it for Christmas.Hoping I get to watch it soon!!
2,Not enough plotline,"I was disappointed with this movie--I thought it would have a little more action. I didn't care for the scenes where Merlin changes Arthur into an animal, nor did I like the whole 'wizard duel' idea. Not one that I would care to show anyone."
2,Disappointing,I was a little disappointed in this book. The reflections on Austen's work weren't as insightful or interesting as I was hoping.
5,Essential Reference for the South Seas,"Douglas Oliver's OCEANIA should be the foundation work for any collection on the South Seas. Forget the various short versions of Oliver's work (they have different titles so there is no problem with getting one of them by mistake). You wouldn't want a condensed version of WAR AND PEACE, and you won't want a shortened version of Oliver. This two volume work is the standard ethnography for Oceania. It is thorough, reliable, and has great illustrations. Like all highly inclusive works, it will not satisfy the specialist. If your interest is solely in the Maori, then you will need special works on the Maori. This work is where the collection starts, whether the collection is to be specialized or fairly general. Whether your interest is in Oceania itself, in Pohnpei alone, in ocean cultures anywhere, or in world history or anthropology, this work deserves shelf space. Does that make it sound difficult or boring? It's interesting to the general reader as well."
1,Blah!,"This is almost too bland to call it an RPG. It is highly repetitive. Level after level you combat the enemy, collect some stuff, repeat ad naseam. This is the second worst game for Xbox (see Pulse Racer for first place on this one)."
1,Not Xbox Material,"I live in Japan, and since there's about 20 games out for the Xbox here, I picked up this one. I have to say that this is the worst game I've played for the Xbox, and the only one I've traded in. I never trade in games, but this one is something that belongs on pre-PSX hardware. The dungeons are all flat paneled, straight out of Wolfenstein. The fight scenes are slow and repetitive, and get boring after twenty minutes. Characters aren't very interestingly drawn, which isn't too bad, since there are no central characters anyways. The story is non-existent. Even the CGI is ugly. It entertained me for half an hour, and I spent 2000 yen on it, so it scrapes up one star."
2,"Great gfx, Monotonous...","For starters, im a huge rpg fan, I have Gamecube, Ps2, and Xbox. And honestly xbox is the most expensive paperweight ive ever purchased. Metal Dungeon Has excellent graphics, But the battle system is basically automatic, and all you do is clear out dungeons full of cyborgs, so basically youre just doing the same thing over and over and over again. I got this game because i was hoping maybe xbox put out a decent game besides Halo. I suggest to anyone not to mke the same mistake i did, and if you're going to buy any xbox games, read EGM and make sure its not junk :)"
1,Metal Dungeon,This game has no plot whatsoever and is the same boring grey throught-out the game. Capcom didn't put enough of efort into th is and could have done better.
4,Concise and Informative,"Despite it's small size, this book has a wealth of information in the style of the DK Publisher's Pocket books (Search DK Publisher's to see what I mean!). It touches on just about every aspect of the Chinese Horoscope--a great starting point to self-discovery. Accomplishes exactly what it set out to do!"
5,Perfect pocket book!,"When I received this package it had a little note on it that said ""Happy holidays and god bless."", I thought it was sweet that they put something a little extra and personal. Made me smile.I got this for my Boyfriend since he is born in the year of the rabbit... That was his Xmas theme this year, rabbits. Lol. I'm really into Chinese astrology so he wanted to learn a little more. This book a really great, It gives you the low down of everything rabbit, And I love the old folklore stories it has. I want to collect them all!It was smaller then expected, but still is a great book."
3,Why Release It On 2 Consecutive 2 - fers ??,"I love Merle Haggard and his music ! I even like the album listing here but what I don't understand is WHY did the record label release "" Someday , We'll Look Back "" with "" I Love Dixie Blues "" after it was released in tow with "" Hag "" ? I don't get it why they would put it out twice , so they kinda cheated us music - Hag fans ! It's like if you want "" Hag "" , and "" I Love Dixie Blues "" , you have to have "" Someday , We'll Look Back "" twice !!! and that's cheating us !The album itself , has some good songs though recorded between 1969 - 1971 , is a grab bag of Hag's sessions that has alot to be desired . The highlighs on "" SWL "" , are : "" California Cottonfields "" , "" Carolyn "" , and "" Huntsville "" with a nice performance on "" Tulare Dust "" and "" Someday , We'll Look Back "" . The rest is just ok .I Love Dixie Blues was recorded live on Mother's Day 1973 in New Orleans and is another Merle live masterpiece by Hag and the Strangers . Love these live albums ."
4,Lovely and informative: a very helpful resource book,"I read the reviews on all the colored pencil technique books on Amazon and chose this one. I taught myself watercolor and had been doing some colored pencil illustrations, but needed some help! This book shows all the tricks and tips I could ever need and the steps are usually broken up into understandable stages of a drawing - but not always. I would have liked to see more of the tools at work in the instructional photos. Sometimes just ""use an eraser for this effect"" doesn't make sense without the eraser right there, doing it. I am actually creating my art using Corel Paint with the colored pencils and this book is a terrific help!"
2,"not basic at all, another ""see it, do it"" book","2 pages per technique.. no examples to practise the technique on. this is writen for people who can ""see it, do it""."
2,Not For Everyone,"This book just didn't do it, for me. I was hoping for some helpful information and there is a bit of that, but I couldn't get past the illustrations. No doubt the author is a talented artist, however I felt her work looked a bit washed out, as though it wasn't really finished. Nothing ""popped,"" which is one of my favorite capabilities of coloured pencils. Also, I kept getting the feeling that the perspective and/or the light/shadows were off in some paintings and the values weren't pushed enough. These things kept distracting me and putting me off. Also, the demos are very illustration-oriented, which is fine, if that is what you are looking for, but don't buy this book if you want to learn other applications, like sketching, realism, etc."
4,A needed book for beginners,I just got into drawing with colored pencils and this book has others beat by a big margin. Most aspects of the use of pencils are covered in an easy and straightforward method. Highly recommended for the beginner.
2,Acceptable but have other books on hand...,"I bought this book with several others, and if I didnt have a comparison I would probably rate it better. The images are washed out, cartoony, and poorly drawn. The author doesnt seem to like using colors at full value, rather he/she prefers to have all the pictures in soft colors."
3,"Good concept and examples, but needs more","I had to purchase this textbook for a statistics/geography class. I thought the text was overall well-written, easy to understand, and presented the concepts exceptionally well. I am not a ""math person"" so being able to quickly grasp the lessons and having clear graphs presented and explained, was very helpful.What I did not like about this textbook was the lack of practical problems to solve. Though the equations are given and explained, there aren't problems inside the book to work through and see the answers to and get feedback. While the book solves one or two problems and gives the steps, it would still be nice to have additional problems, especially when there are so many equations and different information presented in the various chapters. It might have made the book longer, but it would have sped up learning considerably! The concepts are presented flawlessly, but students need practice."
3,Too many great moments for one disc,"The 2003 rugby showcase event was the best and biggest in world cup history. It featured some of the most memorable matches in history. It was never going to be possible to re-live all the greatest moments from such a successful world cup in one 100 minute disc. I would have prefered and been willing to pay for extended highlights of all the big games of the tournament with limited highlights of the smaller ones over two discs. It is just not possible to re-live the excitement and catch all the action in small limited highlight packages of every game. But as there is no other alternative, this is still a worthy and necessary purchase for any die hard rugby fan."
5,Review - First ever purchase from Amazon :o),"Excellent service. I received the delivery within 7 days, although initially the delivery was to be expected in a months time.The DVD was in good condition aswell.All in all a good first buy from Amazon for me."
2,softspots tatianna,"I own these shoes in 3 colors. They are the most comfortable shoe, however this particular pair is so narrow at the instep it hurt my feet to wear them. Unfortunately I had to return them."
4,cute shoes,"These shoes are very cute and mostly comfortable. They are a little snug in the front toe and a little loose in other places, but comfortable enough for most uses. I like the style and height of the heel. I'm thinking of getting the red ones."
1,Not what they used to be,I first purchased Softspots Tatianna style shoes in 2008 in white and navy. The quickly became my go to shoes. I wore them everywhere and received multiple compliments. There was never a breaking in period and the cushion and heel back area was incredible comfortable. I purchased a new navy pair and a black pair earlier this year for the spring season and the quality of the shoe has changed. Not only did I get blisters and blood stains on the shoes but the material is obviously different in the heel back area. I have tried wearing them around the house to break them in but I can only take them for about 15 minutes at a time. Wish I could return shoes that do that to my feet. It is like they get your money and see you later! Do not recommend which is too bad. Softspots were my favorite. I have switched to Born which haven't failed me and I hope they never do!
3,Softspots Sandals,"These seem to be true to size. I ordered a wide, and might have been OK with a medium.. Very flattering on my foot."
3,a psychology cycle for me,"A wizard called Radagast the Brown is keeping the nest of a dirty bird under his hat in the movie The Hobbit, an Unexpected Journey. Sometimes I think certain jokes can't be printed because they are too close to the truth about an illusion that is widely accepted for social uniformity. For me the movies in this collection are the cycle that throws in a joke about marching a regiment . . ."
4,The biggest music video ever,"A 1-1/2 hour music video to one of the greatest--if not THE greatest--choral works of the 20th century--its only equal is Tippett's ""A Child of Our Time."" Gorgeous cast, great to see Sir Larry's final performance along with Tilda Swinton, Boromir and King Arthur. Full marks to Jarman for his passion and commitment. Unfortunately, as passion sometimes does, it rather oversteps the mark. In fact, overleaps it, augmenting Britten and Owen's quiet subtlety with a sledgehammer used to beat the audience over the head. There are many effective moments--Swinton's face is built for tragedy--but it's also the kind of passion that unlike the ""Requiem"" itself dates quickly, as this already has. I usually listen to the music without watching the images, though it's nice to have them there to pound the message home."
4,War movie,"This movie is quite stirring, as you can see by the title. It may disturb you some, but that is what war is about."
5,Very inspiring and beautiful.,"I remember, after just finishing watching the movie, why I still remember the book, movie, and soundtrack. Very much a part of what made me me."
4,great music from the past,I had had this album in vinyl but lost it over the years and wanted to the comforting style of music that is a mix of instrumental and vocal.
5,Wonderful music and photography,"I've owned Neil Diamond's soundtrack album of this for years, but never watched the film until today. Beginning with the melding of music and photography during the his song ""Flight of the Gull,"" everything was perfection.If you want to watch a film that will lift your spirits and make your heart sing with pure joy, this is the one."
2,Jonathan Livingston Seagull / Slow Film/ Profound Messege,This film is very slow. Unfortunately no where as interesting as the book. There where a few moments that captured my attention. I think for those who are looking for the same gusto as the book you will be gravely disappointed. The message is still the same: Profound spiritually empowering.
5,Neil Diamond at his best once again,What can be said without sounding redundant of the other reviewers here? Even if you are not a Neil Diamond fan (who isn't?) you will enjoy this CD. Neil Diamond's music never sounds dated even years later when listened to.Every song on this relaxing CD is well done.
5,My Guiltiest Pleasure,"I ""borrowed"" this album from my Mom when I was about 12 or so. I loved it and still do. Of course, as I got older and played in garage and punk bands, I was horribly ridiculed for my affection for this really sweet work. Now, I'm older, have children and a Yoga Teaching wife, so nobody rags on me about this album (of course my kids are pre-school, I am sure that when they reach their teen years, this will be the height of foolishness to them). What the music speaks to me NOW is a sort of contentment. This is, also, some really kitchy 70's stuff.Fast Forward, kids are teens/tweens and yes, they groan mightily when I play this......."
2,Good movie .... CRAPPY audio presentation.,"This film was recorded in DOLBY SURROUND STEREO. The original VHS and BETA versions were presented in glorious DOLBY SURROUND STEREO but not in the original Panavision 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio, but the horrendous pan' n' scan 4.3. The DVD preserves the correct widescreen aspect ratio but is presented in MONO. The import DVD is no different. For some reason Paramount only provided a mono widescreen print for worldwide DVD release. If you think you like the film as heard and seen here on this DVD, its so sad that you can't experience the profoundly moving and powerful film in stunning stereo surround sound. Neil's music comes 'alive' in the stereo version of this film."
5,Neil Diamond a natural for some of Holdridge's best work.,This music has a power which can stand alone from the movie. Neil Diamond's powerful and sensuous voice conveys perfectly the intensity and meaning of the original scores by Lee Holdridge. An excellent choice of music to help someone of any philosophy appreciate the meaning of Bach's book.
5,10 Stars!,"When I was in junior high (in the early 70s), I got my first cassette tape player for my birthday. The only tape we had in the house to play was Jonathan Livingston Seagull. I played it and stuck it away as soon as I bought my ""rock music"", because I would have been embarrassed if someone found out I liked classical music. I have replaced that cassette twice, and now I will replace it with a CD. It has turned out to be my most favorite album of all times. I am a sailor, and there is nothing more spiritual then to take my boat out in the warmth of summer, anchor it in a quiet cove, wait until after dark when the sky is full of stars and the light of the moon reflects off the water, put this cassette in, and sit back and relax. There is nothing better!"
5,Beautiful,"When I was growing up, it wasn't ""cool"" to like Neil Diamond. After hearing the this soundtrack, though, I didn't care. I'm a big R. Bach fan and when I found this soundtrack, I bought it immediately and even hunted down the movie (remember, this was before the Internet and these things weren't so common *g*). The music is superbly orchestrated and beautifully sung. Neil Diamond's voice is perfect for these songs. The album (vinyl, that is) version of this soundtrack has a booklet with all the words and you can't help but be uplifted by the songs. This soundtrack captured the spirit of Jonathan Livingston Seagull perfectly."
5,A Diamond Constantly Above the Crowd,"It's good to see the renewed interest in Neil Diamond's work. Although most people know him via his hits during the 60s, 70s and early 80s, this album is completely different from most of his other recordings.I heard this album the first time a few years after its release and despite a young age got hooked on it. It has a majestic feel all over, as if it flew over the musical landscape of its period, and probably would do the same even if being released today. One could claim that it gave signals of the new age sound that later developed. In other words, it has aged remarkably well.Anyone who has any of his compilations and actually listens to them should not let this Jonathan Livingston pass them by. Even those who do not have any interest in Diamond's other work may enjoy this album. It is timeless and a constant pleasure."
4,"Surprising, in a good way","I wasn't expecting much, but the movie surprised me--it was quite enjoyable, and not nearly as slow and tedious as I was afraid it was going to be. There are some slow moments, especially in the middle when he meets his new flock, but all in all it's an enjoyable film to watch."
2,This movie is boring,The book far outsrips the movie. I understand Richard Bach's distress at what was doen to his work in this movie. The best part of the movie is the soundtrack.
5,DVD RELEASE,"I just love this movie, it is so unique, and would be wonderful to see it out in widescreen DVD. It was filmed in 2.35.If more people ask for it , it might come out."
5,Attention Animal Lovers:,"If you've ever spent time looking into the eyes of an animal & wondered what hopes & dreams occupied its mind, this recording will help you understand!!!"
4,Sweet and Mellow,This was such a soft soundtrack with songs that really played off of the book. Neil Diamond provided a powerful voice behind the story and the music was all very soft and sweet. Great album to listen to when you just want to relax.
5,Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"The product arrived in great condition. I did think that I was buying the soundtrack though. I was my mistake. I still enjoyed the movie, thanks."
5,A great soundtrack,"Neil Diamond was coming off of his last recording for MCA (Hot August Nights) and he spent several years working on this project. It is different than his other earlier recordings but you have to remember that this is a soundtrack for a movie that did nothing at the box office (based on a book that sold well). Anyway, each song flows into the next and the music takes you a lot further than the movie did."
1,Can't view it,Unbox sucks. Keep getting error message when trying to play movie. Got latest windows updates and still no good. Can't redownload even when deleated the corrupt files. Wasted 10.00. Would love to have seen the movie. Bad service. No help. Sucks Sucks Sucks.
2,Jonathan Livingston Seagull deposited this movie on my car,"Inherently, this is a truly awful picture. Meaningless footage of seagulls (and nothing but), Neil Diamond at his most saccharine, new age glurge at it most repellent passing as philosophy. Ugh.But what gets this awful, yet not even laughable, picture more than a single star from me from is the desperation of 70s Hollywood to try something different, and it doesn't get much more different than this, and that they would put this bomb on DVD.A turkey in every sense of the word. But it still represents the cinematic uniqueness of the 70s as readily as any Scorcese masterpiece or art house classic."
1,Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"This is the worst ""Preview"" I have ever seen. I wanted to decide whether or not to buy this DVD movie and all you showed me were the titles. Is there vocales? Are they songs or speech, characters talking to each other?Is someone ""reading"" the book and CGI figures follow the script. If it's read, who reads it. I used to have a cassette of Richard Harris reading the book, it was wonderful...but I have lost it. Do you have sonething like that. Show me previews with some meat about what the DVD is really like, not just the credits. I want to buy, but not sight unseen."
1,"One of the Worst Movies Ever, I'm Not Kidding","This movie is so bad, I don't think it even qualifies as a movie. All it consists of is a big ocean, and then a seagull with voiceover saying, ""I gotta try, I gotta try..."" and then the seagull flying while Neil Diamond sings, ""SEEEEEAAA--GUUUUUULLLLLLL....."" and then the seagull lands in some wretched nature scene like other seagulls eating garbage or fighting, then he says, ""I gotta try, I gotta try..."" and flies again, and Neil Diamond goes, ""SEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAA--GUUUUUUULLLLLL!!!!!!!!"" and then the same thing happens over and over. I admit I couldn't watch the whole thing. I read a review by Roger Ebert, and he said that he left the theater during the film. Now I see why."
5,"How does one film a classic, starring birds, in 1973?","This is a rare, timeless work. I've been a fan of the book for many, many years. It took me until 2005 to track down and order the movie. While the film (30+ years old) doesn't live up to the book, I give it 5 stars becuase it stands alone as a superb movie. I guess I would give the book 6 stars if Amazon let me."
4,Finally available,"I waited many years to see this movie as I was a kid when it came out and no one would take me to it. Watch it with an open mind and gain some spirituality. The music is excellent and the message is as good for today as it was then. In a time when special effects rule our movies, this one is all natural."
3,"Gorgeous Photography, Okay Film","Jonathan Livingston Seagull is filled with gorgeous vistas, incredible aerial photography and beautiful animals. Unfortunately if you have not read the book (and everyone had in 1973) the plot is thin to nonexistent. You are likely to be lost without that knowledge.This is also a 1973 film. No CGI seagulls here. That does not hurt the film too much, but some of the complex flying scenes such as aerial acrobatics would look so much better if they had been redone with 2007 technology.For fans of Neil Diamond, he makes many appearances in songs that are integral to the film. The symphonic work he did is excellent.Overall I like this film. It is great to look at and listen to. It just is hard to follow if you do not know where it is going, and it shows its age just a bit."
5,It should have come with a guarantee that it will catch fish.,The rod has achieved my highest expectations. Very flexible for those large strippers in AZ. Only wished that I had purchased a two piece rod for storage reasons.
4,berkely cherrywood rod,"I bought two rods---one was fine---the other one was broken in half---the rods were very poorly packed for shipping, in two pieces of cardboard, not in a shipping tube as they should have been.."
1,Not a vacuum sander,"The product shipped is a yellow hand sander. It is not as pictured or described as a vacuum sander. If I was trying to buy a hand sander without a vacuum port, I would be disappointed with the quality of this one. Cheaply made and the handle is uncomfortable."
3,music reiew,"when I ordered the CD I was hoping to recapture the sound of the 70's as I recalled them. As it turns out, this CD didn't do that at all."
4,"Excellent for quick work, but stick with corded tools","This ia a great tool set, I have the 4 pack with the radio too. Wish I had the hammer drill version, but i don't drill concrete that often. Overall, a lot of power in the tools for quick light work. The sawzall is AWESOME, lot of power and very tight package. The circular saw is great, but not a replacement for those std. wormdrive that you would use for framing/mason work."
2,Contractor,"I've had this set for about 6 months. The drill is burn't up. The lock button is in an awkward spot so you tend to lock it on when using it. The chuck is not very good, the batteries are hard to change and it is too large to fit in many spaces. The sawzall works very well but eats batteries. The circular saw is a waste of money. The blade is on the left side and it eats batteries like crazy. It is not very powerful either. The light is the best piece of the entire set. All in all I'm pretty disappointed with Milwaukee on this one. I buy Milwaukee tools exclusively because they usually last. I think the higher voltage sets are not as good as say the 12 or 14 volt sets. The batteries really are ackwardly designed. If you do any drywall they are very hard to get off because the mechanism fills with dust."
3,"Tools are great, batteries are a bummer","I purchased these 18-volt Milwaukee portable tools about a year ago. The tools are first-class. The batteries, on the other hand, only last about a year, regardless of how often you use them. Unless you are a heavy user of Milwaukee portable power tools, the expensive, short-life batteries make the investment uneconomical."
4,Good kit,"Overall a good kit. I'd say the best tool is the hatchet sawzall. I've used dewalt and makita 18v sawzalls and I think they're great too....but the hatchet just takes the cake. Milwaukee just makes the best sawzall...period. Very ergonomic and well weighted, powerfull, and very handy in tight, awkward spots. Also, it has selectable semi orbital cutting. The drill is very powerfull and good as a hammerdrill too. Circ saw works fine.OK, the only problems are the batteries are a bitch to get off the tools. Also, after about a year the two batteries that came with it are toast....and new ones are not cheap."
1,Disappointed,"I have owned this set for a little over a year. The sawzall quit working, the light stopped working, the skillsaw is junk, eats batteries like crazy and the drill burned up. I'm an electrical contractor that used to buy only Milwaukee tools...they went overseas like everyone else and it shows..."
3,Bit holders.,Whats up Milwaukee not having any onboard location for screw bits? This is a serious over sight and a major pain. I never dreamed upon purchasing this combo that I would have to find another way to carry those bits used so often. Now I have also read that the batteries havn't demonstrated the life expected by another customer. I have had the same experience. Is this typical?Is there any good system for an after market screw bit holder that can be attached to the drill?
4,"Honest, interesting, informative and entertaining","The approach is honest as the author wrestles with his desire to do what his conscience tells him is right for the land v.s. the market signals that make those decisions much more expensive. As a complete novice to homebuilding, it gave me a basic understanding of what is involved in building my own home, and made it seem less intimidating."
4,one of a kind,"I remember George having his own late night t.v series back in the seventies,what a great character! This is straight ahead jazz music and George as always gives each song 100% commitment.These are from his Decca 1950,s period and the sound quality is excellant.Seeing George live is really the best way to appreciate what a fantastic showman he is but until Warner Brothers reissue ""nuts"" and ""son of nuts"" this will do nicely!"
4,Herbal Tonic Therapies,"Mowrey is a good author, his blends are well thought out, well written, and well researched. I used one of his books for a herbology class, and found I wanted as many of his other works as I could find. I use his references quite a bit in my own research and blending. The only problem I have with his books is that there are no quantities listed in his blends. The up side might be meditatively cautionary for those not as well versed in herbology and phyto-biology to not just try using plants with the respect and responsibility they deserve. Very good reference book to have on your shelf."
3,A little thick/heavy for coating,"I tried to use these for cake-balls, but they were too heavy and broke them. I tried mixing about twice as much oil in as the recipe called for, but still no luck. They do taste really good, though..."
2,not as good as I thought:(,"Not really what I expected and not very interesting, it was too short a documentary:( It could have reflected a more personal view of some of the girls on this program and more detail of their struggles"
2,school,I had to watch it in my 8th grade PE class and it is very informative and somewhat graphic. It shows the scariness of it and makes you eat for one thing! You wont ever forget it!
3,Documentary,It took a look at ballat and gymnasics(sorry if I spelled that wrong) and what woman have done to mantain there very small sizes to continue there training. It enlightened me more on anorexic behavior and what woman who have it have to over come.
3,Incredibly Uneven Collection,"While some of Sammy's best and most popular stuff is represented here, some of the worst, most derivative work is here, too.Most conspicuously absent, for example, is any version of his groundbreaking ""Birth of the Blues."" There are many who cannot think of this song sung by others, yet it is not among the cuts here.No, instead you get ""John Shaft,"" which is lifeless and colorless, some gospel stuff, and ""The Candy Man."" It is really hard to discern what criteria the producers used to assemble this collection. It does not showcase Sammy's unique style or energy very well at all."
1,I was disapointed,"If you are a Sammy Davis jr. lover, you will LOVE this cd, it just didnt have enough great music on it to satisfy me."
5,"Out of ""CONTROL!""","This album is probably the best sing along album of all time. When you put on the ""Control"" album and listen to it you will swear you are listening to Janet's greatest hits record. But you are not! This album is every bit a studio album! From songs like ""Control,"" ""Nasty,"" ""What Have You Done For Me Lately,"" ""The Pleasure Principle,"" ""When I Think Of You,"" and ""Let's Wait Awhile"" you will not know when to stop singing.Compared to the other smash Janet album of the 80's ""Rhythm Nation"" I think ""Control"" easily wins the battle. In my opinion the best Janet album's you can buy are ""janet"" and ""The Velvet Rope"" but this album is a none stop party. It could very well be the soundtrack of the 80's!"
4,"Step Aside Michael, here comes Janet!","Look before she did a stunt at the Superbowl, she broke through the ranks of pop selling music star with this album entitled Control. I love the songs but I love Let's Wait a While because it's my favorite of hers. In all honesty, I prefer Janet over Michael. She has a great range in music, she sings about love, relationships, and being a woman of the 1980s and of the modern age. I hope she still sings these songs at concerts. She is equally talented as Michael and maybe more so because she is also a talented dancer as well."
3,Overhyped but still lives up,"It seems like this stage of Janet is much better than her Damita Jo stage. Control was a point when she tried her best to use the voice that she didn't really have. She is definetly not blessed vocally like her brother Michael. I know its annoying to Janet fans to compare her to Michael, but you have to in this case.She made some great tracks on this album, but I think that they all sound the same. Actually I know they all sound the same.Her best artistic period was Velvet Rope. As the years went by after the Velvet Rope, All For You and Damita Jo discovered a Janet who wanted to make crappy albums."
1,Ugh,Corny '80s pop- yuck! The only talented singer of the '80s was her brother Michael and now he's a total loser. Check out her later albums like ALL FOR YOU for BETTER music!
1,SHE WANTS CONTROL!,"Well, she's obviously not in control, since all her hits comes from the pure geniuos minds of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Miss Jackson wants us to believe that she was just teasing with her two previous crapy records(that flop commercially and artistically), but the truth is, she knew her destiny was to failed if her father or her didn't work it out8just like Beyonce and her Daddy), so what better to hired Prince collaborators to create a new sound for the chubby diva, who by the way didn't knew how to move!!!, cos Paula Abdul had to teach her, so anyone who posted that Janet was a groundbreaker with this, is misinformed, Janet do had the looks, but not the brains."
5,CONCERT,"SHE IS A BRILLIANT SINGER AND DANCER AND I THINK SHE DOES THE BEST ALBUMS AND SINGLES EVER MY FAVORITE ARE ""TOGETHER AGAIN"" AND ""WOOPS NOW"""
5,In Control! And never gonna stop......,"This is the album that put janet into orbit and crossover to the pop scene from her r&b roots. This CD tells the story of a young girl who claims her independence. Actually I'm not 12, I'm the same age as janet was when she released this and I can say that I'm experiencing things in my life that I can relate to on this album. It's truly a good CD to own, and even though it sounds outdaed musically, it's good for the time being and deserves a space in every music collector's collection. It's bound to make you dance and reflect on your life."
4,very good record like the first two better,im gettin so sick of this janet jacksons first two records are very good you gotta relize she was just starting out and those records sold really good not more than the album control but not bad for a sixten year old girl and control is not her first album in my case i like the album dreamstreet better than i like control why because she was all natural now all plastic surgery and she had some hits 1. say you do 2. top seller young love 3.come give your love to me the dreamstreet album 1.dont stand another chance 2. fast girls so you cant judge the book buy its cover until you listen to it
4,Good Grooves,"Figured I'd expand by musical tastes beyond the gloved one to another Jackson family member. You know, Janet has some timeless tunes here. Nasty and What Have You Done For Me Lately? sound just as good as when they were first released. When I Think of You also strikes both a familiar and pleasing chord. Many good lyrics on these songs and a catchy beat to get your bad self on the dance floor. Some pretty good ballads as well. Why were they just lopped on the end of the CD I'll never know.Nonetheless, this is one memorable R & B CD that can appeal to most audiences. Heck I am a rock n roll guy and find it gets me in a groove shaking mood."
4,Ms. Jackson Reigns,"A long time had passed between this album and her first lackluster effort a few years earlier. Ms. Jackson teamed up with Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam, who kicked up her image and turned her into a pop/R&B diva. The only cut that falls short is ""The Pleasure Principle"". Otherwise, this is a solid album."
4,Classic Janet,Love her all day everyday! These are the songs i danced to in the mirror as a little girl! Classics
5,Flight Time Masterpiece,"This and all Flight Time produce albums are the sound of Minneapolis, Check Out - Change( Warm, Change of Heart) S.O.S Band ( High Hopes and the albums On The Rise, Just The Way You Like It) Alexander O'Neal , The Human League ( Human) and most of all The Time.....Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam and Monte Moir at their best!!!!!! Funny How Time Flies is off the charts and by far the albums best song. A MUST Buy for all Old School fans. When Music was REAL and GOOD And Back Then Janet was real good, Hell she is a Jackson! - Dj Supetown"
4,Had to Have it!,"I just recently(2004) bought this cd. I made the purchase for one song. ""Funny How Time Flies"" The song is only like 2 minutes long, but I love it so much."
2,Dissapointing,"I recently saw Red Dragon and i am in the middle of the book and i decided to rent Manhunter to see if it was better or similar to Red Dragon. Manhunter didn't stand a chance. I also thought the person who played as Hannibal was almost like he was in a school play. Anthony Hopkins if so much better as Hannibal. Also the guy who played as Francis Dolarhyde ""red dragon"" was too normal and sane. But Ray Feinnes was brilliant as the Red Dragon. This movie was also very corny like in the end when Will Graham jumped right through the glass window. There was a couple of good scenes but it still wasn't that good."
1,Read the book instead,"I was extremely disappointed with this film. After reading the book, and several of the glowing recommendations at Amazon, I thought I would be in for a treat, but received a trick! The film dragged along for just shy of 2 hours, and missed vital elements of the book necessary for a true telling of the story. The main factors which led to the killer becoming the monster he was were completely omitted. Instead, we have poor acting, and less than believable location shots, interspersed with ""dreamy"" montages that do nothing to evolve the plot. Anyone who was ""gripped"" or ""terrified"" by any portrayals in this film must have extremely low thresholds for excitement or suspense. It was a yawn that did little justice to Thomas Harris' wonderful book! If you want the full experience, read Red Dragon, and leave the film in the pile of forgotten movies of the week."
1,Can I give it .25 of a star?,"Don't waste your money on the poorest excuse for 80's crime dramas ever. This movie has the worst of every element, poor plot development, poor acting, bad over acting, no character development, bad lighting. Scenes that are entirely colored, green, blue and red, I understand it's ""artistic"", but unles you live next door to a Kenny Rogers Roasters (Seinfield Reference) the entire room will not be red. Don't even get me started on the music, ... And though Brian Cox does a great job as Hannibal, with the other ""actors"" it is hard to tell if he is even acting or just board with the script. It is just a tiresome movie that was a good idea in the 80's, but with a ending that all but mimicks the end of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and with too many events in the movie that just happen, assuming the viewer had read the book, without explination as to why this movie deserves less than ""Killer Tomatoes Eat France"" or any Earnest Movie."
1,Not close...,"I love Michael Mann, but this movie aged as well as ""Bio-Dome"". The whole mind-melding aspect of the plot was silly, as was daddy's explanation of said mind-melding in the cereal aisle. The Sleaze Reporter (tm) character was paint-by-numbers, and a good indication the movie wasn't to be taken seriously.And to the reviewer from Worcester, MA, a helpful hint. When referencing and abbreviating decades, the proper form is to put the apostrophe before the first number; e.g. ""...'40s"" or ""...'50s"". If you're going to be one of those internet goofballs who chastizes other people for spelling and grammar mistakes, you might want to be a bit more careful."
2,Very overrated,"With all the buzz out there, I rented this film with some anticipation only to find that the ""original"" does not equate with higher quality. First of all, it lacks the writing, direction, and acting of both the ""sequel"", 'Silence of the Lambs', and the recent remake 'Red Dragon'. Neither this glorified movie-of-the-week nor the misfire, 'Hannibal', are worthy additions to the franchise."
1,As usual...the book is better,"I pity anyone who watches this film without having read Red Dragon. This film works more as a Cliff's Notes adaptation to a brilliant novel. It seems as though the director wanted the Tiger scene so bad, he left out all explanation to the audiendce. I advise people to READ THE BOOK, and stay away from this hokey, BORING, movie."
2,I couldn't stand to watch 5 minutes of Miami Vice . . .,". . . so 120 minutes of Petersen's somber ""acting"" is even more unbearable. Mann ruined a terrific book by making it an MTV video. 2 stars for what is left of the story, 0 stars for the director and star."
4,You decide...,"I won't get into the debate over whether this is a better film than it's 'sequels' or not. But it's good enough to stand on its own merits, and in many ways, it is better than Silence of the Lambs (and definitely better than Hannibal) due to it's low-key charm and skill.I've heard they're planning to re-make it with Anthony Hopkins, giving it the big-budget treatment; that would be a mistake, because there's really nothing wrong with this film. It eschews the violence of the sequels in favour of creating mood (something Michael Mann excels in), and while the serial killer in this film isn't as compelling as he could be, it's still very effective.Brian Cox does a great job portraying Lecter, and I for one would love to have seen him in subsequent film versions of Harris' books. It may never happen, but this version is still here for all of us to enjoy."
1,Quite awful.,"I'm not sure exactly what the people who like this movie see in it, but what I see is a blandly directed, ineptly acted thriller that features zero suspense. Anybody who says this is better than The Silence of the Lambs probably just doesn't like a film that has garnered much acclaim and attention. Manhunter is just a dull waste of time. For crying out loud, who would you choose: Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, or Tom Noonan and William Petersen?"
3,"good, not great","After hearing all the rave reviews for the prequel that was better then silence, and reading the book that is one of my all time favorites. I bought this movie. It's true to the book but for some reason it just didnt hold my attention the way a great movie does. The ""stellar"" performance by tom noonan as francis dolarhyde is ridiculous, yes he did a decent job but they did absolutely nothing with the character. He only had 3 mins of screen time for crying out loud I suggest you rent this movie before you buy it, if you don't like it then you're not stuck with it and if you do then more power to you. It's definitely worth watching just to see if it suits your tastes"
5,It did not get the credit it deserved.,"A true sleeper. This is Mann at his best. He shows his unique ability to combine music with image oh so well in this film. Several times the movie seemed to draw you into it. LAMBS may have had a bigger budget and bigger name stars, but Manhunter was a supurb potrayal of Lecktor and Graham. I hope that when the next Lecktor movie is made, that the character of Will Graham is brought into it. It would be nice if Mann could direct it as well"
4,Manhunter review,"This film, Manhunter, is much better than its re-make--""Red Dragon""(?) with Edward Norton in the lead role."
4,Just As Good As The Others If Not Better,"Michael Mann (Heat) directs this 1986 film based on Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels: this is the first film made on the infamous Hannibal Lecter who would be memorably played by Anthony Hopkins in the later-released 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Hannibal.' Although not as good as the original 'Silence of the Lambs', this film is well done with a screenplay and acting that surpasses the inferior 'Hannibal' by a long shot.In this film, Will Graham (William Petersen) is a retired FBI agent who's called back to track down an elusive serial killer who likes to set his victims on fire. In need of help, Graham meets with Lecter (Brian Cox) in his cell to get a profile. Will he stop the deranged killer in time with Lecter's help?I thought this film had just as much suspense as its better-known sequels. William Petersen plays a good role as the determined cop while Brian Cox is just as creepy as Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal. A great film to rent or buy."
1,A disapointment,"Thankfully everyone had forgotten this turkey by the time Silence of the Lambs hit the big screen. Loosely based on the first of the series of books by Thomas Harris that showcase the character of Hannibal Lecter it is true to the book only in the names of the characters. The movie version ends prematurely with at least 200 pages of plot left to be told and it dwarfs the Manhuter's lead character to a Cobra-type Miami Vice type copper who is a good 15 years too young in the movie version. Red Dragon, the book that this movie pretends to be based on, is a work of art. Do yourself a favor and read Thomas Harris' best work and forget this movie was ever produced."
2,Overrated 80's relic,"Read the hype online and bought it cheap at my local store. Disappointed by the dated score (cheap 'lectronic ala M.Vice) and TV-movie standard of acting.The scenes where Will Peterson's detective acted outraged-yet-exhilerated when he finaly ""saw"" with the killer's eyes were painful to watch. The over-emoting was really laughable.One thing I couldn't understand was the lack of subtitles. Brian Cox's accented dialogue sounded terrible and not too terribly menacing. Which makes it harder to convince audiences of Will Graham's terrorised state of mind.The final showdown was choppily edited (on purpose I suppose). Lacked dramatic tension, excerbated by the terrible rock 'n' roll music accompanying the scene.Can't wait for a updated remake..."
5,Smell Yourself,"One of the most indelible images in thriller history is the moment we first see Hannibal Lector in the brilliant and mesmerizing Silence of the Lambs. Yet for me, one of the scariest images in film history is the opening shot in Manhunter, where a woman awakens to a flashlight being shined on her by the Tooth Fairy killer. Later remade into the woeful Red Dragon, this movie proves that yes, Edward Norton maybe a better actor than William Petersen, but he certainly isn't a better Will Graham! Michael Mann is a unique artist whose stylish matter of fact approach creates not only the best in the Lector saga, but the best in the serial killer genre, which includes doozies like the aforementioned Silence as well as Physco and Se7en. Classics all, but Mann does something different. He creates an atmosphere that invades some part of your physce and stays in there forever."
3,Could have been,"Could have been much better if they would have been more aligned with Harris'Red Dragon. It would have made for a much better ending. In addition, ""the Tooth Fairy"" would have surpassed Buffalo Bill in sure creepiness if the Red Dragon would have been emphasized greater."
4,Better novel adaptation,"I read the book ""Red Dragon"", many yeras ago, when I saw the movie (the recent one) I noticed that the novel was very ""adapted"" as a prequel for ""silence of the lambs"", I Found here in Amazon.com the first version ""manhunter"", and I was nicely surprised about an excellent novel adaptation and a very good thriller with a limited budget, I have to say the tooth fairy in manhunter is scarier than Ralph Fiennes in RD , the only complaint is the cable that pulls the cop who got shot at the end scenes, but Its a very well done thriller surpasing the new version. highly recommended"
1,Great film tragic presentation.,"I got the new limited edition 2 disc set of Manhunter and I have to say I have never been more disapointed with a DVD in my life. First of all the first disc that is supposed to be the theatrical cut of the film is not. Several important scenes and patches of dialouge have been removed, and unimportant scenes from the directors cut are added in out of context. And to make matters worse the cuts are made very crudely, sometimes cutting people off in midsentence.Then there is the director's cut on disc 2. Saddly this version was never remastered from the source print so the picture quality of the whole film is that of a deleted scene i.e. worse than VHS. Not to mention that several scenes appear to be taken from brodcast tv as several lines of profanity are crudely dubbed over.Take my advice if you are a fan of this movie stay away from this poorly produced DVD, as refusing to buy it might be the only way get Anchor Bay to correct this horrible problem."
2,Disappointing,"After reading 'Red Dragon' by Thomas Harris, this movie was a huge disappointment. The actors, especially William Petersen as Will Graham, lack any strong personality. For whatever reason, the scriptwriters decided to change the script and eradicate several parts essential to the understanding of the story. The reason behind making up their own, somewhat bland and completely different ending to the twist in the book will remain a mystery to me. I may seem a little unfair, as after watching Silence Of The Lambs and reading Red Dragon, Manhunter had a huge reputation to live up to, but it failed dramatically. It's no wonder Dino De Laurentiis wants to make it again. Wait for that version - with the real Hannibal (Hopkins) we all know and love."
1,All Style,"A very silly movie, all flash and no substance. Completely unmemorable, except as a footnote to the far more interesting Silence of the Lambs."
2,Slence of the Lambs Meets Miami Vice,"This story is about Hannibal Lector PRIOR to ""Silence of the Lambs"" and Agent Starly... The book (Red Dragon)is fantastic, delivering a riveting thrill ride... ""Silence of the Lambs"" (movie form) almost did it's book counter part justice... ""ManHunter"" does NOT... I don't read a lot... but this is one book ""Silence of the Lambs"" movie fans should read... The problem with ""Manhunter"" is that it looks like the cinematography of Miami Vice... They use second rate actors... It just lacks in set design and screen play while visual and sound is reminiscent of bad TV movies... Buy it if you have limited expectations... But don't blow your bucks on the Collector's Edition..."
1,Obsolete Film,"As others have suggested, Manhunter is simply an obsolete version of Red Dragon. The editing, acting, and film techniques are all noticeably outdated. Do yourself a favor and watch Red Dragon instead. It stars Anthony Hopkins and, unlike most remakes, is vastly better than the original upon which it's based."
1,Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie [stunk] beyond recognition, Silence Of The Lambs was done so much better than this ... The movie made no sense, it seemed like a bad Miami Vice that wouldn't end. This movie wasn't scary it was a boring cop investigation with guts and gore that was bore. You didn't even see killer ""The Tooth fairy"" kill any one in the entire picture."
1,Please Don't Waste Your Money,"Horrible screenplay, interpretation, and directing doesn't sound like good a description for a movie to watch. This movie is a mockery to the book Red Dragon, which was written by Thomas Harris. There is nothing that's good about this movie. All the actors don't fit their role and so on. The worst part is the person who plays Hannibal. Don't buy this movie."
1,Whats with all the 4 stars?,"I bought this movie without watching it because no place in town rented it, I have seen both Silence and Hannible and enjoyed them both.... All it is is Miami Vice on the big screen, the director should have stuck with the tv show..., they could have done so much no wonder it took so long from Silence to come out after manhunter no one wanted a movie to turn out as bad as this movie was, Silence is a basic re-make thats better, this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen"
1,waste of money,"I consider myself a Lectur (sp?) fan, and this movie was poor. If you like the way Anthony H. plays the character this movie will leave you very dissapointed. I got it on the premise of thinking it would be cool to go old school and see the whole roots of the movie origin. I was wrong."
2,"Two and a half really, but not real impressed","Maybe if I had seen this one first. But I didn't. So, Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecture(sic) will always be Anthony Hopkins. But, thats having just seen the firt two movies. Haven't read the books, don't want to read the... third one? Because my mom read it, and said it was pretty bad. Sorry"
1,F-O-C-U-S !!!,"I normally don't write reviews regarding movies. I think people should see a flick and decide it's value for themselves. However, I think the movie ""Manhunter"" is an outstanding movie. Five stars. Buy it! DON'T BUY the Director's Cut. The entire second disk is fuzzy / out of focus. It's really annoying and a waste of your money. The extra included material is not worth the extra money it will cost you!"
3,Dated & Overrated,"The movie looks and sounds like an old Movie of the Week circa early 1970s. It looks and feels dated.The screenwriter and director maintain the suspense. But it misses being a truly great film because of average performances by the actors and its ""low-budget"" feel. Some low budget films have a gritty feel and work remarkably well because of their intimacy and honesty, but the intimacy seems corny and goofy in this film. The print DOES look like a copy of an old VHS.Wait until this goes into the bargain bin - there is no way it is worth the current asking price."
5,Classic,This is the first time Hannable Lecter was seen on screen. It was a great film by Michael Mann. Classic style and Great Story telling at its best. William Peterson is Brilliant in the lead role and Dennis Farina shines as his Boss. In the Style of Early Miami Vice but with a lot more edge and attitude.
1,A waste of time and money!,"Please do yourself a huge favor! Do not buy this DVD. If youmust suffer through it, ... rent the ....Extremely poor videotransfer (even on a high end system that is well calibrated). Simplyunbearable. Audio track no better. Makes Iron Butterfly sound likethey are playing in a garage...."
1,"I don't know what movie everyone else is watching, but...","Manhunter was a pretty poor film, in my opinion, nowhere even CLOSE to Silence of the Lambs. Regardless, the DVD is worse. The cinematography is beautiful, and the scenes are well shot, but the director's cut on DVD is atrocious. It looks like a 5th generation copy from a TV show, not the crystal-clear picture I'm used to on a DVD. I'm a director's-cut fanatic, and this is the WORST director's cut I've ever seen (it makes my ?th generation director's cut of Alien look GORGEOUS). To top it all off, the editing is choppy and uneven, with dialogue and music abruptly ending. And of course, the horribly-cheesy ending is still just as horribly cheesy. This is not a direct attack on the film itself, but the DVD production. I wouldn't pay $5 for this. Please, please, PLEASE, save your money! Or get the VHS tape. Just don't buy this."
1,God-Awful,"A pathetic mess. Full of MTV art-direction, cinematography, editing, and music. No character development, no suspense. A total hash of the far superior novel. Silly, shallow flick for people who find deeper meaning in rock videos."
1,Beware,"It is pointless to think it is superior to Hannibal or even The Silence of the Lambs. Notwithstanding the superb cinematography from Dante Spinotti, the plot is weak, the Miami Vice looks are awfully 80's...and the soundtrack is utterly weird..it does not match the slow action! It is a pity that Mr. Lector hasn't received more credit.Also, the featurettes are not that interesting. After all, believe it or not, the DVD is worth the small booklet, that looks like a mini FBI file.Unless you are a movie collector like myself, maybe, you should consider spending your money with other DVDs like Hannibal or Silence of the Lambs. I advise you to browse Amazon for something more meaningful."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST SLEEPERS OF ALL TIME!!!!!!,"This is truly one of the most freightening and thrilling movies ever made. Lechter is played as well or better than in the Lambs. Mann and Peterson team up to give exceptional directing and acting performances. All of the supporting cast, music and filming make this a joy to watch."
3,manhunter,"Low budget adaptation of the novel Red Dragon by Tom Harris. Although a bit cheesey, being from the era of Miami Vice and Disco era, it is a pretty tight little thriller. It spawned and greatly influenced the FBI/Criminal Profiler subgenre that Harris gleaned from John Douglas, the former FBI director of their fledgling Criminal Profiling Unit formed in the seventies.This movie is the forerunner of all the Hannibal Lector movies and those productions stole heavily from this Michael Mann effort. William Peterson and Tom Noonan are standouts in performance. TV shows like all of the CSI's and Criminal Minds owe there existence to the combination/colaboration of the John Douglas book ""Mindhunter"", Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon and the movie ""Manhunter""."
5,Best of the Rest.,"This film in my opinion is the best Hannibal film, better than the Remake just out. Even though Manhunter stands on its own as a singular film rather than part of a series. The portrayals are exactly how I imagined them and Cox gives us the best Lecter (even though Hopkins was brilliant in SOTL). The ending improves on the book, and has the brilliant song by Iron Butterfly. This is also a very disturbing and very 80's film, which adds to the whole atmosphere. Not enoughdevelopment for Dolarhyde, but this version of the film isn't really about him so we can ignore that. Buy this and watch it befor you get preconseptions from the remake."
4,"from the Thomas Harris book ""Red Dragon""","Early William Peterson worth checking out. Another great story from Thomas Harris. Worth seeing even if you saw the later remake ""Red Dragon"" with Edward Norton in the same role. There are parts of each I prefer over the other, so they compliment each other very well. You can decide for yourself which you see as being more true to the feel of the book."
3,3 stars at best.,"an ok movie not even close to being on the same level with silence, or hannibal for that matter, which i feel was a major step down from silence. in short, its an average movie."
2,Manhunter,Manhunter is basically the same story as the movie Red Dragon (both where based on the book Red Dragon) but isnt as good as red dragon is several ways. First: the character back stories are not in Manhunter any more then is absolutely necessary and skip over points like why Francis Dollarhyde turned out the way he did. Second: For me the way Will Graham was portrayed and written here makes him seem more crazy and slightly less believable. And third: The way they handle the arrest of Hannibal Lecktor by Graham. In here its only mentioned in Red Dragon the confrontation is shown. I like the Hannibal Lecktor movies but would skip this version and just get Red Dragon or rent this one instead of buying it.
3,Decent but not great.,"For the Amazon reviewer to state that Manhunter is ""arguably even better"" than Silence of the Lambs is sheer idiocy and should immediately disqualify him from further reviews. Manhunter is not even in the same league. Apart from some good performances, the story is poorly told and not even particularly compelling. Silence of the Lambs blows this movie away."
2,I'm sorry.,"Blame it on the Eighties, but I had a hard time taking this film seriously. From the hilarious hairdos (all of the men sport permed new-wave haircuts) to the post-modern interiors, this film reminds me of the 80's style that only exsisted on cable television. The Southern accents are embarrasing and the music is painful. Maybe I wanted too desperately to join the group of people who proclaim this film ""superior to the Silence of the Lambs."" Unless they like it in a Plan 9 From Outer Space kind of way."
1,THis movie stunk.......... PLease dont waist your money,The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of hannibal so I rented it and I thought it was borring. It didn't talk much about him and Brian Cox[hannibal] did a terrible job as the roll of the killer. It took a long time to get to the action and I'm just glad I didn't buy it PLEASE DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY!
4,"Not a prelude, not a prequel","We may be the ONLY people not to recognize this as the prequel movie. Just kidding - lots of others saw this when it was released in theaters, just not as many as the director hoped. Brian Cox is THE Hannibal, Hopkins doesn't come close to this performance. Cox instills far more fear and he ONLY gets to use words. I was disappointed with Silence of the Lambs, it just didn't measure up in terror when compared to Manhunter. Note that I appreciate the Director's Cut more than the Theatrical release that this edition represents."
4,Prequal Silence of the Lambs Meets Miami Vice.,"This film was made several years before SILENCE OF THE LAMB. The central character is not Hannibal Lector, but Will Graham (portrayed brilliantly by William Petersen); a FBI agent lured out of retirement to work on a special serial killer case. The film is tainted by the decade in which it was made (late 1980s). However, the film also feels like an episode of ""Miami Vice"" on speed which adds to the cat and mouse plot of the movie. The acting is better than average and the movie contains a rocking soundtrack.Nevertheless, Michael Mann seems more impressed with lighting and sound than he did with plot development and the film suffers as a result of it; often times instead of adding th the texture of the film, the lighting detracts.Overall, a decent murder detective movie with some really good acting and not too much gore."
5,Another Michael Mann Masterpiece,"What do you mean-almost as good as Silence of the Lambs. Both the book Red Dragon and the Video Manhunter are much superior to the smarmy Silence of the Lambs. For one thing Brian Cox as Hannibal Lechter is truly chilling, while Anthony Hopkins, a much overrated actor, is just cute. The pace of manhunter is better, the cinematography, the character insights, the gritty feel. This like Mann's Thief is one of the greatly underrated films. I could do without the whole scene with the tiger though."
2,"Great Movie, If I Ever Got It.","Geez, ths is a great movie (way better than that horrid 're-imagining') but If you want the film I suggest you go pick it up at the store because Amazon's service is terrible. I ordered it over a week ago, and it said it would come in 4-5 business days, but 6 days later, I got another E-Mail saying it would come in 5-6 business days. I haven't ordered anything off of Amazon after it took three months to recieve the Brady Bunch Movie, but I had credit and needed to spend it, but still, I'd appreciate it if the movie came when it was supposed to."
2,boring,"I went into watching MANHUNTER expecting to be entertained anda little freaked out.I was the total oppositte,I was bored andwaiting for the movie to end.The acting was unbeleivable and poorBrian Cox gives a laughable portrayel as Hannibal Lector hisportrayal of Hannibal cant hold a candle to the oscar winningone given by a born to play Hannibal(Anthony Hopkins).The moviehad no charactor study and went into all the action way to fastand The toothfairy was nothing like the sinnistar pyhscotic buffallo bill(THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS).None of the actors are rightfor the roles either the movie is boring,confusing,and poorlyacted,written,and directed...."
1,TO BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS ! ! !,"Please, please do not buy this movie, whatever format it is in. Manhaunter is a terrible attempt at making a Hannibal Lecter movie, and it strays far from the tree that brought us The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal. Brian Cox sounded simply too British for this part, while Sir Anthony Hopkins had just the right voice. The actors in Manhunter must have had medical issues. And Michael Mann, oh my God he's such a poor excuse for a director that he might have even been abused as a child to have created something this awful.But look on the bright side: The remake, Red Dragon, appears in theaters on October 4th, starring the one, the only Hannibal Lecter worth mentioning, Anthony Hopkins. Go see it."
4,Better than Silence and Hannibal,"Manhunter is a pretty good thriller and I found it a lot better than Silence of the Lambs, and MUCH better than Hannibal. I heard that they're thinking of remaking Manhunter, I sincerely hope they don't, because it will most likely turn out to be a big disappointment like Hannibal."
4,Taken on Its Own Merits,"Taken on its own merits, this is a pretty good movie. Michael Mann's direction is great, and his use of lighting and textures is impressive, and Brian Cox is in many ways far creepier than Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lechter. And the climactic sequence, set to ""Inna Gadda Davida,"" is sheer perfection in and of itself. My only complaint is with William Peterson, as FBI Agent Will Graham. Nothing personal, but Peterson couldn't act his way INTO a wet paper bag. A wooden cigar-store Indian would have been more convincing in the role. Nonetheless, a very good film and well worth seeing. It makes ""Silence of the Lambs"" make a lot more sense, and it is not a bad way to kill an evening."
3,Manhunter specific,I purchased this item in my persistent attempt to acquire a version of Manhunter that completely restored all of the edits that had been made over the years. This ain't it. Get the Divimax version; it has them all back where they belong.I find it curious that Manhunter and Blade Runner suffered so much from rampant editing of excellent products.
1,MGM JUST SCREWED UP MANHUNTER CAN YOU BELIEVE IT,OH MY GOD I CANT BELIEVE MGM DID THIS TO MICHAEL MANN'S MANHUNTER THE RESTORED DIRECTOR'S CUT THE HIGH DEFINITON HD TRANSFER IS GONE THE WIDESCREEN ENHANCED FOR YOUR WIDESCREEN TVS IT'S GONE MGM JUST GOT BAD AS PARAMOUNT THEY LOVE TO SCREW PEOPLE NOW ANCHOR BAY RELEASED THE RESTORED DIRECTOR'S CUT IN 2003 AND I OWN THAT ONE DONT BUY THIS ONE I JUST CANT BELIEVE IT WHY ON EARTH DID MGM DO THIS TO THAT FILM
5,Michael Mann has rarely been better,"Slick and well done. Brian Cox potrays Hannibal Lektor(spelling taken from the original novel) with sinister grit. But the show belongs to William Peterson, whose acting is top-notch. So convincing was his acting that the flow of the story was loads better that of the Thomas Harris novel. Trust me, if you have seen Red Dragon and would like to see a movie that totally outdoes the book, watch this. And after that cherish it."
3,"Good story, bad execution","My husband kept telling me I had to watch this! I love the Hannibal Lector movies, but had not watched this one until recently. It was a good story, but the blue lighting and the cheesy 80's music just killed me to watch. I'm not an 80's fan at all, and just couldn't stand it. I watched the movie and the story and acting were great! Just wasn't expecting 80's-ness of it all."
5,Breakthrough film...,"Manhunter is absolutely amazing. Despite the fact that it is fifteen years old, it is just as good as the day it came out. William Peterson is great, and if you like Silence of the Lambs, you should see this. The filming, colors and lighting are wonderful - it will remind you of The Insider. This movie is scary as hell also, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat..."
5,Terrific film only slightly let down by undeserved transfer.,"This is a fucking TERRIFIC thriller from Michael Mann!! Many comparisons have been made between this and Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, and I would have to say that it's better than both of them!! The only thing that slightly detracts from the film is the slightly disappointing transfer. It is very soft with some gran, shimmer and some MPEG artefacts, including Macro Blocks, among others. The audio is a bit low but overall sounds good. The extras are particualy good as well. This is a good disc to own, despite the problems with the video and audio."
5,Excellent,"The latest edition of Dr Grimmett's Percolation is surely the best book on the subject. He presents topics as clearly as possible without neglecting the technical details. His writing style is very readable, making much of this book accessible even to those who don't have all the necessary background in mathematics to understand all the proofs. Anyone looking for an easy introduction to the topic would be better off with Stauffer's book. But to gain any moderate understanding of this fascinating subject, and the methods and results of current research, this is the only book to have."
3,Vehicle Dimensions,I would like to know the dimensions of the item. Is this a matchbox size vehicle or to scale? If so what? Thank you
3,A decent heater for the price,"I have this heater (from BJs), and it runs well, but it's not exactly silent: in ""hi"" mode with the thermostat, it sometimes beeps five times in a row, slowly. I have no idea what this means, but these beeps do wake up our son (it's in his room), so I have to say, no ""hi"" mode for us.The thermostat isn't exactly accurate, either. To keep a room at 72, I have to set the machine to between 75-78, depending how cold it is outside."
1,If it's Bionaire: Buyer Beware!,"I bought this item thru Amazon and received it on 11/29/06 with its two wheels and rear axle (enclosed in Bionaire packaging) unmountable because they were the wrong size; as such the heater can't stand up and is unusable. I contacted Bionaire customer service and was told they are no longer manufacturing the item, dont have any parts for it and therefore would not honor the enclosed warranty which covers parts and service for 5 years telling I should get the wheels from Amazon?!!! Bionaire is clearly a company I would not recommend buying anythinG from. They are probably dumping unsold redundant products and could care less about the suckers that buy them."
1,Caution,"Be very careful with this product and do not leave it unattended. We purchased our Bionaire last December and, suddenly in the middle of February, it started smoking. It also made a terrible smell, which we luckily noticed right away and unplugged it.Also, please be aware that although this product comes with a 5 Year limited warranty, the shipping and handling costs exceed the price of the heater - i.e. it costs the same amount to send the item to the manufacturer for repair or replacement as it does to re-purchase the item. Because there is no guarantee Bionaire will honor the claim and make the repairs/replacements, the warrary is rendered effectively useless."
1,Useless Plastic garbage,"I was sent this device as a replacement when a Holmes heater I actually liked, the now-deleted HQH 306, began to malfunction on its low setting.This heater, in a cheesy plastic shell, is a useless little disaster. At the highest setting, a tiny amount of heat is radiated upwards for a functional distance of about five inches from the unit's surface.It's a darn good thing I didn't pay for this unit. It's so bad I will continue to use the Holmes heater on the high setting, turn the thermostat as low as possible, and move it physically further away."
5,Great TV but...,"A Zenith TV that looks exactly like this one, served us well for the past 10 years. The button stopped working to turn it on and off, but the remote still functioned so we continued to enjoy the TV. We called Sears for repair and when the repair man checked, they said the parts are no longer available. We paid $1100 in 1997. They may give us a replacement (according to the contract), but a Zenith 36"" in no longer available. I checked their Web site. This is important because we have ours in an entertainment center where the TV fits like it was made for it. If this model does become available somewhere, just know the parts are no longer available."
3,Comprehensive summary of history as it used to be taught,"This is an amazing book in that it ignores so much of what really happened in this country. It ignores major events such as the Trail of Tears because, well, they are not pleasant to talk about. That is not history; it's wallpaper.However, having said that, I recommend the book for anyone who wants to know how history used to be taught and thought about in this country.For those seeking out some balance, take a look at The American Pageant. For real revisionism, see Howard Zinn's People's History of America. The true history of this country lies somewhere between Zinn's nightmare and Commager's glorious dream."
1,How can you have a Am Hist book w/o Tubman?,"I found this book for a penny and that price is deserving. I didn't read the book, I looked at the index to see if any of the major players including Sojourner Truth and Crispus Attucks were there, most noteably Harriet Tubman. She was not there and neither were the others. So, this book isn't worth it, not even for a penny..."
4,Good,Received the book in pretty good condition. Minimal markings in the book and no missing pages. Highly recommend this book for all that require it
5,Classic Vellacott,Philip Vellacott's translations of any Greek play remains for me the epitome of a translators art. Really it's thanks to Vellacott that Euripides became famous in our day! These translations will never die.
5,Christmas songs with some spice.,Jose Feliciano goes the whole spectrum with this album. From fun and fiesty to slow and sentimental. If you love Jose Feliciano this is a must have product.
3,A little disappointing,I bought the CD for a Christmas gift as my boyfriend loves his version of Feliz Navidad. We have played that song over and over again but the rest of the CD is just OK.
5,Technically superb,"I think we will hear more about Mr. Di Battista. This album is techinically brilliant, Stefano has does his homework. Parker's Mood is best tribute album in long time."
4,An excelent choice,"I originally came across this album on vinyl in 1989 and loved it. When I saw on the sleeve it was 10 years old, I couldn't believe it! Listen to ""bay stick around"" first and you'll think what I did - this album was far ahead of its time, and its still great!"
5,Definitive Debut,"Joe Jackson's first disk is a masterpiece, showcasing the diverse influences that were so important to his early songwriting. He jumps from neo-punk agression in the opener ""One More Time"", through the reggae feel of ""Sunday Papers"", into the tongue in cheek ballad, ""Is She Really Going Out With Him"". The entire release showcases the strong guitar playing of Gary Sanford, contrasted against the rock solid bottom end laid down by bass player, Graham Maby. Listen to the sparcity and the composition against the reggae bass and rock steady beat with piano counterpoint in ""Fools In Love"" and remember an earlier day when Joe was truly an angry young man. ""I'm the Man"", his second release is another companion that follows perfectly."
4,Tomac from Cincy says,"Classic album. Holds up extremely well over time. As ""sharp"" today as when it was released."
4,This is great music,"This is rock and roll. If you do not like rock and roll do not buy this. This is pure rock and roll. No part of this is not rock and roll. Joe says, ""Tell me that this world is no place for the weak."""
5,Look Sharp... SHARPER THAN EVER,"Back in the late 70's when I was a teenager, I purchased this record due to it's unique packaging... A 2 disc 10"" ""sandwich"" album with cool cover art and even a ""LOOK SHARP"" lapel button. I was shocked to find that the music was incredible as well! Needless to say, even though I still have the record, I haven't heard it in years and stumbled accross it on Amazon. Boy am I glad I did! The album is a total classic that is as fresh as when released sounding even better on compact disc. A MUST FOR EVERY COLLECTION."
3,Constantly catchy,3 1/2Jackson's blazing debut had no problem drawing comparisons to to a more blue-collar Costello in that early post-punk melodic rock phase.
1,Rip-off,I stupidly purchased this just because it was Bill...didn't even look on the back! I'll never pay that much for a 16 minute DVD again...no matter who it is!
1,bill engvall a decade of laughs,This was the worst video I have ever purchased it was only 16 minutes long you would think a decade of laugh would be at least 60 or more I paid what nine dollars for that video i was going to send it back for my money back it doesn't say how many min a video is when u select them. I was very dissatisfied with this product.
4,Funny but too short!,"I agree with many of the reviewers that the DVD is too short. However, I love Bill Engvall, so I take what I can get! This DVD has these cute and funny videos starring Bill, who looks so young in them and the Christmas one made us gasp in shock because he is made up so nerdy. The appearance of John Michael Montgomery in one of the vidoes with his dazzling smile and dimples told me exactly why he is a country superstar! He is cute! Travis Tritt appears in another video with Bill. I love him! The video I'm A Cowboy has a track by Brooks and Dunn. Fantastic! The whole DVD is definitely too short so buy it used to get it cheaper!"
1,A decade of rubbish is more like it!!!,"The whole DVD only goes for about 20 min. Four very crappy songs, not even remotely funny. Would be vastly improved by removal from retail outlets. Seen him in concert. Very good usually - what happened here?"
1,Worst DVD I've ever seen!,"When I ordered this DVD, I thought it contained the taped shows of the same material that was on the CD -- which has some really funny stuff. What I got instead was 15 minutes of the worst video I've ever seen! The music was so loud, it drowned out the lyrics -- supposedly based on Engvall's routines. My advice... don't bother to purchase this DVD it's not worth $0.15, let alone $10."
2,This was a musical,"If you like to watch MTV or VH1 then you will like this. I was expecting another stand up show but aparently this was not one. Somehow I missed where it told me that it was a musical with Bill telling his jokes in it. Don't get me wrong, I love his jokes and his stand up. I'd pay to see those any day, but not to country music."
2,Buy the CD - NOT this DVD!,"I love Bill Engvall but this DVD is a rip off!The ""track listing"" in the description above is for the CD of the same name, NOT this DVD. All this DVD has is a few music video/comedy bits on it. 16 minutes total!!! It's not worth $10. It's not even work half that. He should have sold the DVD and CD as a combo like other comedians did (like Dane Cook's ""Harmful if Swallowed"" CD & DVD). Instead it costs $10 to buy this DVD and another $14 to buy the CD.Just buy the CD, which is really worth it, skip the DVD!"
1,THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE DVD IS WRONG,IT IS ONLY 16 MINUTES LONG AND A RIP OFF. I LOVE BILL ENGVALL AND I THOUGHT THE DVD WOULD HAVE ALL THAT WAS LISTED. WRONG! ONLY 5 SHORT SKITS. THEY LISTED ALL OF BILL ENGVALL CD SKITS. AMAZON NEEDS TO CORRECT THERE DESCRIPTION. NOT EVEN WORTH $1.00.
2,What the heck?,"Beware, this is not a collection of his stand-up routines, this is only the music videos he's done over the years. There's only about 5 of them."
1,not worth the price,"I looked at several Bill Engvall dvds, and picked the WRONG one. This is short, not as funny as most of his stuff and definitely not worth the price. I should have sent it back!!!"
3,Thoughfully named,"Most of these songs should have stayed lost. Not much different from your average street corner busker. DG changed course and was successful for a reason; his White Ladder style is interesting, whereas this, on the whole, is boring as watching paint dry. The ""techno treatment"" on White Ladder made him intersting."
4,"Lost Songs , David Gray","David's music is so beautiful, and should be owned by anyone who likes Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, or Dave Matthews. Lost songs is a collection of wonderful ballads Like Flame turns blue, hold on , and falling down the mountainside. All of his older CD's should be re-released as well ( A Century Ends and Flesh)"
5,David Gray at his best,This has to be one of the best David Gray albums made. His soulful voice and folk-style music bring a relaxing blend to this masterpiece of a CD. A must have for anyone who is a fan of the genre.
4,"Good Performance, Better Value","Can recommend this product for replacement speakers. Sound is as good, maybe better, than the originals that simply wore out and since the boxes were fine this means my computer can now have true kick. Only negative is the instructions do not indicate which lead is which."
3,Not Your Standard Textbook,"This book served as supplementary reading material for a beginning-creative-writing course at the university level. Anyone who is looking for a how-to guide should beware; though this book was written by one of the giants in the field, it is not standard textbook material. Still it is a worthy addition to your collection for its elegant prose alone. Those who disagree with Stegner's assertion that creative writing cannot be taught will find much else with which to agree."
5,The best Doctor Who novel i have ever read,"A stunning novel from these two excellent writers (and nothing like their previous 3rd Doctor novel which was amusing and well characterised but lacking in plot); The Hollow Men, on the other hand, is John Wyndham-style story of a village under seige with a terrible secret. A classic evocation of the traditional Doctor Who story of spooky going's-on in an English country setting. The depicions of McCoy and Aldred are terrifically accurate, and the villagers are so well drawn one can almost picture this novel as a TV adventure (my favourite is the arms dealer Trevor Winstone - a *real* black-white-and-gray character). Simply beautiful and very funny in places too. Six out of five!"
2,Somehow this one doesn't work for me,"The Doctor takes Ace to the little village of Hexen Bridge, where he is due to attend a school reunion at a school of which he is one of the Board of Governors. But shortly after their arrival, animated scarecrows start attacking the villagers, and the internal conflicts within the village are whipped up by an external force...A book that includes scenes in which the life of the village, and the individual failures of some villagers, is tied up with the presence of an unknown power (well, unknown until quite late in the book), I have to say that I found this book oddly uncompelling.Keith Topping and Martin Day have constructed a novel which, looking at its disparate elements, is one which I would have thought it likely I'd enjoy. I certainly can't point to any part and say ""this is bad"", but somehow the whole of this book is less than the some of its parts."
5,"Bizarre, well drawn","This book is a collection of wordless stories in the tradition of Lynd Ward (Gods' Man: A Novel in Woodcuts), but with a definite bizarre twist. The art is complex enough to invite the eye to linger over every page. Ott is a great story teller and, although I'm not generally a fan of horror, his creative approach breathes new life into the genre."
3,"desperation, terror, and hopelessness.","Thomas Ott, Greetings from Hellville (Fantagraphics, 2002)Greetings from Hellville is likely to take you places you may not want to go; be warned. Ott's short, silent, rather nasty stories (four of which are contained in this slim volume) depict the sleazy side of life in what could well be any modern metropolitan area. While it would probably be a stretch to call Greetings from Hellville a horror comic, Ott's subjects are undeniably horrific, and Ott fails to leave even the smallest shred of hope that things are going to get better for the millions of nameless citizens of his city. (In fact, in one story, ""G. O. D.,"" the events center on hope being crushed.)Greetings from Hellville is an ugly, depressing ride. And if you like that sort of thing (which I do), you will find a lot to enjoy here. Others may find it a bit too relentlessly depressing for their tastes. ***"
1,Defective,"Followed the simple instructions. Charge the unit first (internal battery). Connected first battery and the display could not indicate battery charged state (in amps or percentage).Ran down the second battery (so that I knew it would need to be charged). Again, it gave no indication and did not allow me to select the charge rate. I am very disappointed with this device."
3,Lynyrd Skynyrd Lite,".38 Special took up the mantle of those fallen southern rock heros Lynyrd Skynyrd and turned it inot a radio ready formula that was unavoidable on the airwaves in the early 1980s. That didn't mean that they weren't capable of writing a catchy hook or two, as songs like ""Hold On Loosely,"" ""Caught Up in You,"" and ""Rockin' Into the Night"" show. The problem with this band can be summed up with the song ""Wild Eyed Southern Boys,"" another hummable tune that, despite its title, is about as threatening as a AMC Gremlin. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a single disc to rekindle some of that early 80s nostalgia, this disc has about as much .38 Special as you need. It beats listening to Duran Duran anyday."
1,STAY AWAY!,"This ""greatest hits"" is a mere rehash of music from what is a mediocre band. There are four throw away live tracks coupled with a series of mundane ""hits"". The two greatest songs recorded by this band, ""You Keep Runnin' Away"" and ""Chain Lightnin'"" are neglected. If you are interested in potential, check out their ""Special Forces"" CD. It is shame that what passes for ""greatest hits"" is yet another mere attempt at making money. You'll find yourself quickly bored with ""Flashback"" and will be flashing back to the money you wish you still owned."
3,"Ok, but probably are better compilations.","38 special, led by donnie van Zandt brother of Ronnie and Johnny of Skynyrd, were more pop than southern rock like Skynyrd and Allman's. The comp. is ok for the price, but I'm sure there are better ones out there. Has some tracks that are live instead of in there best form."
2,not practical for real businesses,"the advice is fine if you are running a baseball team or some entertainment oriented company, possibly even a web-based retail company. However, if you have a real business with tough competition and a product to make, it is isnt practical.advice for the boss includes putting the coffee maker in your office so people come talk to you.That is great advice if you have absolutely no responsibility to produce deliverables.anyway, the book is cute and many workplaces could benefit from a less serious attitude, but this one was almost as useful as Magic Johnson's book on how to run a business (with fame and almost unlimited capital, how hard can it be?)"
2,Lame!,"My, oh my, that was lame. Yes, Max Allan Collins' ""Skin Game"". It's a tie-in novel to Dark Angel and it takes place during and right after the series finale Freak Nation. Well, let me tell you, if the show was planned to continue in this direction, then I'm happy that it ended when it did.You know, when I picked up this book, I thought that it would expand the main players, Max, Logan, Alec, Joshua but all we got was secondary characters - Otto Gottlieb and Agent Thompson. Those two had more scenes and got more background info than any other character in the book. Max was her usual bitchy self, Logan played the good little puppy that heeled whenever she ordered, Joshua and Alec were reduced to two scenes, other than that they were just a part of the crowd... Ick."
4,Not too shabby...,This book picks up where the tv show left off. Again the author makes it seem just like the show and revealed some plots and answered some questions that season 3 would have elaborated on. I found it some what like silence of the lambs the more I read but in the end of the book you see why it was so. I again recommend this book to any dark angel fan who was disappointed not to get a season 3.
5,Alec and Joshua Centerstage,"One point about SKIN GAME that I haven't seen mentioned in the previous reviews are how Alec and Joshua get to take centerstage for a great deal of the book. The two transgenics carry the plot throughout the second half of the novel quite admirably, and I applaud Max Allan Collins for continuing to develop my two favorite characters.In fact, there's one lengthy ""Alec"" scene that I would love to have seen filmed. Read the book and you'll see what I mean."
2,Almost good,"Good - It wraps up some loose ends from the showBad - Spends to much time rehashing a lot of the previous happenings wrong, In fact one of the main premises of this book did not happen according to the show. Therefore this book is on shaky ground. Descriptions of most characters sickeningly sweet. No new ideas are introduced. The new character introduced has attributes of another character from a previous episode. Everyone does not have to fall in love with Max. Do they?I would recommend this to anyone who is dying to know what happened after the end of the show, but I would not be captivated by this if I was not a fan already. The writing seems amateurish."
2,Left a bad taste in my mouth...,"I am a huge fan of Dark Angel and was terribly disappointed at its cacellation. I looked to this book to answer my questions. It didn't, plus the writer was severly sloppy. There was no mention of the tattoos, and none of Sandeman... it was all left hanging so you have to buy another book! Not only Max Allan Collins started it out fine and was actually on a roll, but he ended it just horribly. Facts didn't add up and its like he just threw together a quick ending because his deadline was running out. Alas...the Dark Angel fans are left looking in other directions for answers!"
3,Wow.,"Remember those cliff hangers? Well, some finally get answered, not all but some. Overall, it was a good read. If you want some answers from the series go ahead and read. If you want all the answers you need to read the next one."
5,Great Everyday Glasses,"I bought these for my mom for Christmas and she loves them! She uses them all the time. So far none have broken, so I'd say that it is a pretty sturdy glass."
5,Finally found what I was searching for,Was searching for a card reader that would handle both SD Card and CF Card AND will not be messy to carry around. This is it.I have a SanDisk 12-in-1 reader that broke yesterday. It just stopped working with my Windows XP laptop. So now I am planning to buy this one.I know PNY makes good stuff.
3,"OK, Slow at Times","Here's Sasha again taking care of business...if that's what it's called. Fourplay wasn't as good as Threesome. This novel wasn't a surefire page turner as Threesome. After reading, I now wonder if Sasha really had wonderful business skills or was it the sex that got her big clients? In this book Sasha is about 42 yrs old and still has it going on, so I'm not mad at here.Fourplay didn't really get exciting until nearly the end and didn't have as much sex in it as Threesome.What I don't understand is how Sasha didn't know who LT was since such a woman of the world. Maybe the sex impaired her thinking. I wish Brenda L. Thomas would have written the wife more into the storyline.I'm not totally satisfied with Fourplay, but how can you not read the sequal when the first book was good?"
1,Very Disappointed,I was hoping this book would be a page turner from the reviews I read but I had to force myself to finish it. The lead female character was all over the place and the 4 guys were really not even that important to the story. Having steamy sexual scenes does not make a book better. Even in the end it didn't tie together. I would have rather gotten this from the library.
2,Man,I did not like this book at all. Not a page turner. This was more pages then the first one and the first one was better.
4,Okay,"I just finished reading Fourplay. It was a good read, but I think I liked Threesome more. It was a great follow-up. That Sasha has got to be one busy woman!!!"
3,they're back!,"Sasha, Phoenix and Trent return in this sequel to Threesome. A few years have passed and Sasha is a little bit older and wiser. Or is she? She now has her own public relations firm. Re-enter Phoenix, who is having some issues that are threatening his basketball career and image. Then Trent, her ex-finance, enters the picture. As if that wasn't enough, Sasha is juggling relationships with two more men. And the games begin. Not as exciting as Threesome, but worth reading."
4,"You Can Run, But You Can't Hide","Sasha Boriannai is back, and this time around she's making the rules. Platinum Images is her new PR business. In an effort to begin a new chapter of her life she's out to prove to the good ole boys, that she can do the job just as well as they can.But, will she have a chance to demonstrate what she and her company are capable of?While moving up the corporate ladder, she's trying to let go of all the ghost in her history, but she can't hide forever. The temptation is finding its way back when Phoenix Carter, a blast from her past is in need of her help. Will she be able to keep a level head?Fourplay is a good read, but not as fulfilling as Threesome."
3,Dumb Bird,"Sasha was smart with her money, but when it came to love she was dumber than a doorbell. Her life was overwhelmed with her business that she didn't have time to properly think about her own life. I made myself finish reading this book. I enjoyed the 1st novel ""THREESOME"" so much better. The author is talented and has written things that tickle your imagination. It was a chore to finish reading this book, because Sasha, the main character irritated my nerves with her nonsense decisions in her personal life. I would consider this author again, only because I like the sophistatication of her writing; but I hope she gives her characters a brain in her next work."
3,And the wait was worth it......,"I was so overly excited when I heard that Sasha Borianni was back! I had to know how she fixed things up after THREESOME. FOURPLAY was a good read, less risqué than THREESOME, however obvious a little suspense and drama to her already busy life.The very busy entrepreneur, who suffers from anxiety is in the mix juggling two new men; Jordan, and Lyor along with Trent and Phoenix, from her past. To add to her hectic life, Arshell, her best friend, is having a menopause related affair and her dad has cancer.After reading this with the very provocative title coupled with the book cover, I must admit I did expect it to be a lot more! I am happy that she was able to shift through things and figure out the differences between sex & love."
5,WHOA,all I can say is whoa. Ms Thomas did her thing she had me believing this is real but then again it could be. All I can say is just get the book and you will not be able to put it down
1,"Awful, Just Plain Awful","I wanted to give this book ZERO STAR. But the scale said that I had to give it at least one, so that's all it gets. I had never read a book by this author but the synopsis of the book read like a good read. It started off so slow that I didn't see where the plot was going anywhere but I kept reading, thinking that something would happen in the next chapter. After three weeks and 119 pages, I GAVE UP!! I was more than sadly disappointed. This is probably the last book I will read by this author. I'm still wishing I had gone to the public library instead of spending money to add this book to my collection."
1,Not ready for prime time,"I tried this and found it is not ready for prime time.1. It seems everything causes static (e.g. 2.4 ghz telephones,networks, microwave ovens.2. The earpiece did not stay in my ear. It would fall out within seconds of placing it in my ear. Terrible design.3. If you do not have a bluetooth phone and need to use the base, it is totally unwieldy. The base is almost the same size as my phone!I returned it the day after I got it. Too expensive for what it is."
2,Lifetime of unreplacable battery: just beyond 1 yr warranty,"I got my BT200 for non-Bluetooth phones 15 months ago. It worked well and I liked it a lot despite annoying background clicking and short battery life. Now, after just over a year, its battery often won't last a day of standby let alone conversations. Jabra support says they have no spare parts or service and offered me a 20% discount on a new one. In other words, beware that this is a disposable product! I also have a BT-110, which uses a AAA cell that has much longer life and can be removed for recharge and/or replacement."
1,BEWARE! THE iPOD OF BLUETOOTH: NON-REPLACEABLE BATTERIES!,"It was only hinted at inside the manual, but never definitvely stated, so I called JABRA and asked. Yep, I was right:THE BATTERIES INSIDE BOTH OF THESE UNITS ARE NON-REPLACEABLE.JABRA doesn't even have the cajones to admit this directly in their manual. They must figure if Apple can get away with this BS on the iPod, they can, too.What does this mean to you? Somewhere between 300 - 600 recharges, YOU WILL HAVE TO THROW THE ENTIRE UNIT AWAY!!! At least with the iPod, you can pay Apple some ridiculous amount of money to replace the battery.But wait, the idiocy doesn't stop there: The earpiece is a tapered ear-gel: IT DOESN'T STAY IN YOUR EAR unless you hold it there with your hand, which defeats the whole concept of ""hands-free"".And, to top it off, the activation/de-activation sequence/ear-tones are confusing and goofy; half the time, the activation remained after I terminated a call, which quickly drained the adapter.WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!"
3,Works with Treo 300 but ....,Well after I finally was able to dig up information that this device would work with my Sprint Treo I purchased one. It works great except for one thing. I can't answer the phone with the headset itself. I have to actually flip open the lid of the phone to answer the call and *then* press the phone button. It kind of defeated the purpose of it for me.
2,It's better to wait for next generation,Well-built but it has terrible voice quality with severe echo. I have to put the base next to the headset to get decent sounds. I'll try it for a couple more days before shipping it back.
4,Careful - it might not work with your phone!,"There are two versions for non-bluetooth phones with 2.5mm jack. One for a 3 conductor jack and one for a 4 conductor. Don't be fooled by the link for compatible phones, which advises you ""All phones with 2.5mm jack."" Not true!! My phone is a Nokia 3500 series and it has a 4 conductor 2.5mm jack, and it doesn't work with this Jabra (model 100-91030000-02) I needed the model 100-91430000-02, and there's no distinction on Amazon's website. So this will be the 2nd return. First was my error in ordering the Jabra for a bluetooth phone. My phone is not."
4,Great for the price and convenience...,"Despite what others have said, I've found this device extremely easy to use. Sound quality is fine unless out in the wind, but then most cellphones have that problem as well. For the price, I'll take the phenominal convenience that I've gained...just for the easy, hands-free voice-activated dialing in the car, it's worth it!"
2,horrible mic,"The one I bought has very horrible mic reception, a lots of friend insist me to change another headset.The connection from headset to adapter is too slow, takes average 4 second to make connection and answer the phone, i do miss some calls.The adapter sometime will lose power without any warning, need reconnect the power adapter to active it again.the headset fits my ear very well and the sound quality is good too."
3,Cumbersome method to receive and end calls,"Great product except for when you are receiving and ending calls. For receiving, You need to press receive on both the phone and headset. When ending a call, you also need to hit the end buttons on both the headset and phone. Pretty dangerous when you are driving and even more so when your phone is a flip phone and you are driving...figure it out. I have a headset which is not wireless but I can answer and end calls with a button on the headset. Jabra needs to fix the switch so that calls can be answered and ended with one switch."
1,Waste of Money,"Thing only good thing I have to say is; it was comfortable. Hard to hear when driving, didn't work at all with the driver window or any window down, moving or not. Battery life is minutes not hours. Takes too long to recharge, if it even completes the recharge cycle. It takes to many operations to answer a non-bluetooth phone. And whoever designed it, never really used it, looks great but doesn't function well. Finally, customer support, there really isn't any."
1,Stay away and save your money!,"If only there were a **zero star** rating...I own many wireless gadgets, and this is by far the worst I have ever bought. I say this after having tried three of them. The sound quality is just horrible. It sounds like you're speaking under a blanket while popping corn, and that's on a LAND line. I contacted their tech support (don't get me started), and got a lame ""well there must be some other wireless devices interfering with it"". I made sure there were none, I tried it in different locations, and came to the conclusion that it is just badly made. If the headset is more than a foot away from the base, you get crackling... what's the point? Besides that, the user interface is terrible, but I would put up with that if the sound quality were good. I've heard bad things about bluetooth before, but this is confirmation... can you hear me now? NO!"
3,Public Domain Movies,"It would have been nice if Amazon had given you the titles of these three movies: Amazing Adventure, His Girl Friday, Charade. (this is a correction) All Public Domain~ that why the cheap price.Charade is the best of the three, co starring Audrey Hepburn. Audrey finds out that her late husband was not who she thought he was. Her life threatened and murders occurring around her, she befriends Cary Grant. Can she trust them.His Girl Friday- Many people enjoy this story of a fast talking newspaper man that tries to prevent his ex from marrying another man. Has been remade many times.Amazing Adventure. This is one of Cary's early movies. It's rather bland."
2,Worst Cary Grant Collection Available (But still Decent),"I am a Cary Grant Fanatic and love all his movies and own all the major box sets, but this one has the worst film quality of all. The three titles in this collection are The Amazing Adventure, Charade, and His Girl Friday. I thought I would mention this because the titles are not listed on this site. Amazing Adventure, even though it has been digitally remastered looks as if you bought it on VHS. Charade is in better condition, but was also released 30 years after Amazing Adventure. His Girl Friday looks okay, but it is found in better quality in the Cary Grant Box Set available on this site. There is also a photo gallery available as a special feature that is three minutes in lengthAll in all, the price is right and Cary Grant fans will still enjoy it, but I would advise looking at a different, higher priced collection, if you want the best quality."
2,Contents please!,"I entered Room For One More DVD in the box and it brought up this DVD. I naively assumed that the movie I wanted was in there and bought it. Guess what? NOOOOOO. I was really ticked off and would have been MORE so if it had cost me double.In the three dollar basket at Wal Mart this is okay but when you pay good money and then shipping and handling and it is NOT what you wanted, I at least get a bit put out."
2,"""Room for One More""","I can not find ""Room For One More"" aka ""The Easy Way"" with Carey Grant and Irene Dunne ANY WHERE! This is a great movie and families need to sit down an watch it. Especially in our narcisistic, me-me, screw you society.Anybody knows where I can get a copy. Please let me know! I would like to see it again (and again), buy each of my four children a copy, and let my 7 grandchildren see it.It has received over 1,200 votes on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) to be made into DVD. But, nobody is listening!"
2,No Movie Titles,"I too, wish they would list the movie titles. I am not ordering because of this reason."
1,Perfume Emporium Send wrong product- No Customer Service,"The Perfume Emporium sent me the wrong product.When I finally got them to agree to taking it back and refunding, they would not send me a return address nor would they reply to my emails.Very dissapointed, will not deal with them again and I am $100 out of pocket with a product that I don't want."
3,Hard toy to maneuver,"This is a hard toy for a child to maneuver. My son did not like it at first because it just didn't move the way he wanted it to move.I realized that the elastic controlling the duck was to tight, so I removed it and replaced it with a nylon string instead. Now my son likes it because he can control it better."
1,Big Disappointment,"In our house we call this the ""poorly designed toy"". As another reviewer pointed out, you have to hold the stick at just the right angle, and you also have to dig the wheels into the ground to get traction in order to make the wheels turn. In addition, the wooden ball at the top of the stick is too big for little hands to hold on to. Our 15-mo old daughter will grab for the toy but get frustrated that she can't push it properly. Sometimes she ends up just carrying the thing, but mostly she abandons it and finds another toy."
3,Difficult to Maneuver,"This is a beautiful toy w/quality construction. However, it is a toddler toy. My toddler, who is a very coordinated and efficient walker can never manage the right angle to activate the ""flapping"" feature on this toy. It's becoming a source of great frustration to him because he knows from my demonstrations what it is capable of, but is unable to accomplish it himself. I think by the time he's old enough to get the right angle consistently, the novelty of pushing toys will have worn off."
3,Don't Pay More Than 6 Bucks!!!,Definately get this used. It starts off great with Hogg In The Game...the strongest song lyrically and production wise on this album. Other than that there are probably another 3-4 worth listening over and over but I think to enjoy it more you need a system to hear the bass cuz other than that it's ehhh.
5,Excellent & Beautiful: Views of Rome is a Classic,"Views of Rome is a unique guide to the most significant sites of ancient, Christian, and modern Roman architecture. Steven Brooke produced the work--the first collection of its kind in over one hundred years--during his tenure as a fellow of the American Academy in Rome. For this book, he has written detailed captions that provide the history, location, and, often, directions to each site."
2,(Not as) pretty as a picture (postcard),"""Views of Rome"" was a huge disappointment. Thankfully, I didn't drop $50 on the hardcover version.The book is barely usable, either as a preview of the architecture of the Eternal City or as a remembrance of a visit. The book is comprised of terrible unimaginative black-and-white images of many of Rome's most famous architectural wonders. The photos are composed well enough, but are basically straight-on shots with no attempt to communicate the personality of the buildings or their grandeur. The photographer must have taken all his photos early in the morning, because there is not a single person in the shots to provide perspective.The synopsis of Roman history that starts the book is actually fairly interesting -- certainly more so than the dull photography that follows."
2,Shelly duvllal stroys,The plot is.lame the.actors over act the story is boring by Disney. Headless horse man much better than this so.call. version of the classic tail
3,It is Advanced Calculus.,"First let me set the context of the review. I am not a math whiz kid. I have a very strong interest in mathematics I just don't have the facility that I have seen in others.Now that being said I used this book as an upper level undergarduate course in Advanced Calculus. The book expects a lot of mathematical maturity and did not offer any real insights to me. As a consequence I did find myself having to constantly refer to other calculus texts to get an understanding of what Kaplan was explaining. As a resource for learning Advanced Calculus and gaining insight I find it useless, though it is quite useful as a reference."
1,Terrible Book,"This is the absolute worst mathematics book that I have ever attempted to use. I would rather stick my head in a vise than try to learn anything from this book. Here are the four of the worst offenses:1. The book is not self-contained. One must constantly refer to other books to work the exercises. Write a complete book next time, jerk.2. If ""mathy"" were a word, it would describe this book. Where are the applications? You won't find anything practical here. Boring!3. How about some examples? That would be nice. Unfortunately, examples are few and far between. Think water in the desert.4. How about some organization? Nope, you won't find it in this book. It will lope along for several sections, then ""Boom! Here are some random exercises. Good luck! I hope you've understood everything perfectly until now, cause this is comprehensive, baby!""This book is required for my class or otherwise I would throw it into a cesspool. When I'm finished with my class that's just what I will do."
1,I recommend James Stewart,"From what I noticed, this book comes with few examples, which I need to learn well. However, I learned the same topics originally with Calculus by James Stewart (fifth edition), which comes with very clear explanations, diagrams, and examples. Then the practice problems start off easy and then gradually increase in difficulty. Instead of Kaplan's Advanced Calculus, the James Stewart book is highly resourceful and I would recommend it to any student in calculus, because it can work for practically anyone."
5,Excellent in-depth book,I have used the earlier edition of Kaplan's excellent text on Advanced calculus from early 1960's...I have studied and taught this subject and I always like to refer to this book....excellent and solid foundation in advanced caluculs for any student
5,Excellent Introductory work,"This book is an excellent introduction into the world of American fortifications combining history with a light technical description of the fortifications and their development. This vast topic is reduced to a readable history showing the role the fortitications played in various periods of peace and war. The section on the American Revolution was one of my favorites, but the Civil War was also good. The text covers from the arrival of Europeans to the missile age with a new type of defense line made of a chain of radar stations. There are many finely drawn illustrations and photos of varying quality. This book is a great starting point for the non-fortifications ""freak"". As a member of the Coast Defense Study Group and CAMP I can only praise this work as a major contribution to the field since it so nicely puts everything together for beginner and expert."
4,Readable overview,"This book is highly readable and offers a complete history of American defenses from the beginning till the end. From this book, the interested reader can locate a time period and follow through with their own research using books with more specific detail, but probably less scope."
3,"Okay mug, terrible color.","I bought this for a travel shave mug, and it will probably be fine for that. Be aware that it will not accomodate even slightly oversized shave soaps. The annoying thing is the color. It isn't ""sandalwood""...it's closer to the old ""flesh"" tone crayola...sort of a pinkish tinted peach color. Bleh."
1,"Poor Warranty, Technology Not ready","I have always bought Sony products, but now I feel the need to ... due to my experience with this TV. I bought this TV 6 months ago, and the TV seems to have lost it's brain. The computer in the TV that allows you to change the volume, channel, input, etc. is locked up and the TV will do nothing now. Sony only has a 90-day warranty on this product, unlike most TV manufacture's which is 1 year. This is a very pricey fix to have to pay [$$$] to fix a 6 month old [$$$] TV. I recommend if you buy this product also get the separate extended warranty."
4,Your turning on a mutant!,"The ESL quality of the English subtitles in this movie are nearly as entertaining as the movie itself, and that's saying a lot! My only serious complaint about the DVD is the fact that the subtitles get stuck at one point and the same line--and nothing else--is visible on the screen for at least ten minutes, leaving non-Spanish-speakers to try to figure out what is being said. Anything else awful about this movie (There is plenty!) only makes it that much greater. Bonus points to whatever religion it is that the female lead, Shamara, claims to belong to that requires her to cover her face and pretty much nothing else!"
4,"A Pretty Good Worship Album, all in all.","I've read several reviews, and perhaps my tastes aren't the norm, but I have found this album to be one of my MOST favorites for worship. To be fair, my wife can't stand this album... but then she can't stand TobyMac, rock, and the like, either. I want songs to jump out and connect with my worship attitude, and I feel right at home with this album. A little bit eccentric, but Newsboys through and through, and just right for rocking/funking out at the office when your body has to sit still but your spirit wants to rock. I say darn the torpedoes: add this to your list of worship albums and just enjoy it!"
4,Newsboys go Remixed(Again),"Newsboys remixed is not necessarily a new thing for this band. In many of their singles, they have mixes, but also in Shine: The Hits they have the awesome MegaMix. The remix of It is You is basically unrecognizable, it starts really weird. If you like remixes, this CD is for you! They don't have any new songs, but this CD is pretty good, compared to all the other great Newsboys CDs. NEWSBOYS RULE!!!!"
1,Not Recommended,"I would not recommend this CD to anyone new to the band or to anyone that does not like remixes. The band's normal songs are much better than these remixed versions, which I was not very impressed with."
5,the BEST Christian techno,"This cd fills a gap in Christian music and will turn on more unBelievers to the Newsboys music and message. These remixes are outta sight, many of them better than the original versions--especially ""Thrive"" and ""Rescue."" But if you do NOT like techno, you will NOT like this cd--so please DON'T buy it and give the band bad reviews on amazaon. ... This band is getting really, really impressive. As their impending secular success multiplies, my prayer is that they will stay ""on message"" and be used by God in a mighty way, which U2 managed to do only through their third recording."
2,"I love the Newsboys, but...","Hey, come on, whenever I've bought a ""Newsboys CD"" I've always been entitled to more than I expect. But not with this one. I have all the Newsboys' cds, and this one, apart from ""Hell Is For Wimps"", their 1990 release, is my least favorite. It has a few good remixes, and the techno thing is sure prominent, but techno's not my thing. I love the Newsboys, and the fact that the Newsboys themselves mixed some of these is pretty cool, but it's just not as good as their other stuff. Go buy all their cds, and when you're done, come get this one. Don't expect it to be a ""best of"" album...it's not."
5,Grows on you with time,"I'm a long time Newsboys fan. At first I was a bit disappointed that some of the mixes were a bit weird. As I've listened to it over and over I've grown to love most of the tracks on this CD. Sadly, I would consider this album not that worship-ful. I highly recommend Newboys' album Adoration, which will leave you pouring your heart out to Christ!Press in to Jesus...worship Him...there is NO LIMIT to the intimacy you can have with Him. He loves you so much! He has promised that everyone that seeks Him with all of their heart will find Him! (Deut 4:29)If you're looking for the best Christian praise / dance / techno then I highly recommend:Club J - Praise Jams Vol 1Octane 1.0"
2,4 Good remixes out of 13?,"A good/great remix album first of all needs songs with strong melodies -- you have to have a ""hard"" foundation before you mess with the structure.One of the best remix albums was the B-52's ""Party Mix."" Six songs, 3 on each side of the LP, and there was a continuous beat so the songs segued into each other. Pick it up and hear how it's done!Now, the Newsboys are an exceptional group and they have a GREAT foundation of music. So, how come only four (4) songs end up working?The four remixes that work are:1. Joy (Let's Be Frank Mix)2. Thrive (Is That James Dancing? Mix)3. Fad Of The Land (Lounge Mix)4. Love Liberty Disco (All Mixed Up Mix)You can still ""hear"" the original song but it's all mixed up with great beats. The rest are dull or just don't keep any of the foundation of the song intact."
5,Best Picture Award!,"This flat screen 36"" Sony TV gets our vote for the ""Best Picture Award"" out of all the TV'S we have looked at during the last month. We had a chance to compare with over a dozen other makes and models in the 32"" and 36"" class at our local Sears Store. These included several top name brands. All had the same feed and were tuned to the same channel. The 32"" and 36"" Sony Triniton's outshined by far all of the other competition in picture sharpness and clarity.! It's a very nice looking TV and the stereo sound quality is excellent also."
3,It is a great film,However it is from a long time ago and that does not work well with my current client population. An okay film.
5,Great writing,"I first discovered Rebecca West in college when I had to read The Return of the Soldier for Brit Lit. I love her very descriptive writing, she really captures emotion and setting. A great read!"
1,A Child Prattling,Got this book from the library after I saw a friend on Facebook had liked it.It is curious that the library still had the volume as it was old - perhaps people are still taking it out.I did not finish - I read as far as the father defending the murderess based on an unfair judge.I did NOT like the writing. You could open the book anywhere and the sentences seemed the same.
2,Don't get this game! Buy another one!,"I rented this game (luckily I didn't buy it) hoping it would be a good college basketball game. Man, was I wrong. I really wanted it so I could play with my favorite team, but found that my team wasn't even in the game, even though they are a division 1 school. In fact, the game leaves out a number of 1-A conferences. Some of the conferences they leave out have teams that make it to the tournament almost every year! I don't get it. The gameplay also is not good. I feel like I have almost no control over the ball handler. The courts are not detailed either. They all look the same (with the exception of the school logo in the center). I stress to you not to buy this game. I am just happy I rented it before buying."
4,BUY THIS GAME ''IT ROCKS''!,"THIS IS A GREAT GAME AND YOU SHOULD DEFFINETLY BUY IT,BECAUSE IT IS ,FUN ,EXCITING,AND IT IS SO REALISTIC THAT IT HAS THE RANKING OF EACH TEAM AND YOU CAN EVEN SHATTER THE BACKBOARD AND DO MOVES SUCH AS THE ALIOOP,CROSSOVER,SLAMDUNK,AND THE PICK AND ROLL.SO BUY THIS GAME TODAY ANDYOU WILL BE AMAZED AT HOW MUCH FUN YOU WILL HAVE PLAYING THIS GAME."
5,im in this game,im in this game ...if u watch the skit while UCONN is loading im the shirtless guy with the blue gaotee and eyebrows and the u on his chest....i bought it u should too(but i got 300 dollars for being in it so the choice is yours)
4,It has it's moments,"But it's not the best Police album. Still, I like it better than most. If you like the songs you've heard of, you'll like the rest OK. The Police tries a misty, or is it foggy, sound."
3,A Dark and unusually thematic piece,"I remember when this was first released. I had a roommate who kept this on the turntable (remember them?) for months! I found the album to be difficult to get into, but over the years I have grown quite fond of it. This is surely worth having, a very unique collection of songs, very much a part of the early 80's."
4,Yin Or Yang?,"For me this is a far better album than ""Zenyatta Mondatta."" I even prefer it over ""Synchronicity."" Here the band is sour, relaxed, & robust. Some of their previous work seemed a little forced, but with these songs they appear to gel. I'll only focus on four of them. ""Spirits In The Material World,"" is a cutting testament to the shallow material things that many view as essential to their momentary contentment. The reggae feel enlivens the somber mood. ""Everything She Does Is Magic,"" is a spunky love song with a soaring bridge. ""Invisible Sun,"" here Sting is at his sardonic best. His matter of fact voice blended well with Copeland's strong percussion & Summer's echoing chords. This is one of the few anti-war anthems I have ever liked. ""Omegaman,"" is a good rocker with Andy Summer's standing out."
4,Classic band that will never go away..,"The year was 1981 and the Police were on top of the world, musically and lyrically. The album is remembered most for the most beautiful pop song of them all...""every little thing she does is magic.."". It still sounds so fresh and cheerfulin 2002. Other high points are ""Spirits in the material world"", ""Invisible Sun"" and the most clever of clever guitar riffs in ""Omegaman"". ""Secret Journey"" is testing and tuneful (echos of the ""message in a bottle"" guitar sound). For me some of the songs are lacking something..""Rehumanise yourself"" and ""Demolition man "" just don't do anything for me. However on a very bright note , it finishes with the wonderfully gloomy""Darkness""...ah..the great '80's!"
3,Good even when average,"3 1/2What starts out as what could have been their greatest work quickly warps into a party disc. In contrast with thematic content, a big middle chunk remains merely fun, albeit with some underlying intelligence that occasionally inspires. Even at their pop-locked best however, it was clear The Police were still refining an already masterful chemistry."
2,Still waiting for the One,"Four stars for the music, which holds up very well indeed, in addition to bringing back many fond memories from my youth.Two stars for the mediocre remastering, which sounds oh so very, very ""digital"", i.e., thin, harsh and tinny, though louder than the initial CD release. Wish they'd done this one in HDCD instead, like the King Crimson and Roxy Music remasters. Perhaps the SACD version offers a broader soundstage and more midrange and bass?One star for the lousy packaging, which picks up scuffs and fingerprints easily and grabs too tight a hold of the CD. (For an example of how to do digipak right, see King Crimson's digipack-ed release of ""Thrack Attack"".) I'd suggest waiting for the jewel case release of this one before purchasing.So, two stars overall. Maybe they'll get it right with the next remastering...."
2,Three good songs eight filler,"The album has a great title and and even better cover. It starts off great, actually the first three songs are classics. And... thats it. the rest is filler. Can't remember the names of the songs and I can't remember any of the dull lyrics. 3 out of 11. Very poor average."
1,Another European/American capitalizing on African roots,"Of course music should be the one place that such trivial yet devistating issues such as racism should not breathe, but unfortunately the world has never been how it should be. Just as much was Elvis' mockery of Chuck Berry, Kenny's mockery of actual jazz, and Eminem's mockery of Hip Hop...The Police are the most successful non-Caribbean mockery of reggae. It's so pathetic."
3,Pretty Good but not their best,"I really thought this Disc was Hit&Miss at best.a little more Hit but not by much.Spirits In The Material World,Every Little Thing she does is Magic,Invisible Sun&Too Much Information are The stand out cuts.but this Album on a hold seems out of place at times."
5,The Best Police Album,"The Police reached their peak as a group with this album. With the exception of a few songs (Hungry For You, Too Much Information), every song is a classic."
4,Essential Police,"Of the Police's five studio albums, I think this one's the most consistently enjoyable. To me, Ghost in the Machine stood out from the other four, which are variously undermined with worthless filler, in that the CD as a whole (and not just the hits) actually does a good job of representing the Police's elegant and dark pop spirit.The name fits the album very well; picture something slick, shimmering, and electronic inhabited by Sting's restless muse. I also liked the cover image, which represents the band members' likenesses as LED digits. Very postmodern. Very 80's."
3,Multi-Channel or Stereo,"If you are wondering if this SACD is Multi channel 5.1, its NOT.The back says ""SACD Stereo CD Audio"".The Audio CD sounds great but the rear and center speakers dont come up for bat in this format."
4,Good product for the price,These performed exactly as expected. I debated going with a LED version night light but at this price for 3 it took care of all my needs instead of just 1 room.
3,"Finally, the right fit...","The first holster received was defective in manufacture. Made in Mexico. I have several Bianchi holsters for various guns, and no complaints. I went 'back to the well' for a replacement/return even after the first unit wouldn't snap closed, in desperate hope that the stitching was done wrong... and I was right to do so. I am well pleased with the holster's quality. I will view the first one as an aberation."
4,Great Bob CD,I always thought Planet Waves was supposed to be one of Bobs low points until I heard this disc in my car and was very surprised how fresh and alive this disc is.Not a dud track plus a classic 'Wedding Song' worth getting this disc just for this song alone.Great disc and well worth getting.Shame no bonus tracks are included.
2,Disappointing....,"The only song I really like here is On a Night Like This. This is a very sluggish Dylan album, which is strange, considering he hadn't made a legitimate studio album in almost 4 years (Dylan's last official album was in 1970 with New Morning). He did do a soundtrack (which is good), but it really wasn't an official ""album"". You'd think he have more energy after the long rest, but alas, no. It just seems like he's going through the motions here. Most of the songs here are average at best, with The Band and Dylan sounding like ""let's get this over with"". Dylan went on a tour (recorded for the far superior album Before the Flood) shortly after this album. Reportedly, he had some of these songs on the playlist, but as the tour wore on, he dropped them. Except for the song On a Night Like This, this is just very, very bland. It's now awful like Self Portrait or Knocked Out Loaded, just bland, boring, and disappointing."
4,Loose and weird,"This record was recorded as a warmup for the Dylan/Band tour documented by ""Before the Flood"". The music is casual, and mostly relaxed. ""Forever Young"" outshines the rest of the songs."
4,4 Out of 5 Stars,"Pretty good and underrated album. I rate this a 4 out of 5 because I feel albums like Highway 61 and Blood on the Tracks are 5's. Some good songs on this one. One question, what is the difference between this normal priced CD and the one priced in the $30 range? The more expensive option has ""Original Recording Remastered"" in the description, but both this and that were reissued in 2004. Are they both remastered and for some reason only one has the word ""remastered"" in the description? Without directly comparing it side by side to the expensive option, can't tell if it is ""remasted"" or not, but the sound sounds good to me. The expensive one is off the Sony label and the normal priced one is off the SBME label (Sony BMG Music Entertainment). Other than the price and those formalities, what is the difference?"
3,Love You More Than Ever,"The last track says it all. Dylan at his finest; for the intent is so real, so truthful, so enduring. A song one could listen to for thousands of miles."
4,Good but some throwaways,"The good news is ""Planet Waves"" is full of good songs that go unappreciated for some reason..""On a Night Like This"", ""Tough Mama"", ""Going, Going Gone"", ""Hazel"", ""Forever Young"", ""Dirge"" and ""The Wedding Song"" are great songs!The bad news is a meaningless rock version of ""Forever Young"" and a couple of filler songs I can't even recall the titles....one song is kind of catchy.....""You Angel You""...that's the one!The playing is great. Bob and The Band are in good form, but I can't help but wonder if they were a bit rushed to record it."
1,Take it from an honest Dylan fan.,"Anyone giving a four star review to this is kidding themselves. Its a total dog's breakfast. I'm a Dylan fanatic. I love all but the bottom two or three albums of his catalogue, which I consider Planet Waves to be among. The song-writing is half-baked: the lyrics aren't profound, they're cobbled hurrily together. The Band just aren't tight. They're not playing together. Each song is like a drunken person stumbling: you keep thinking they're going to fall over, and they try really hard to hold themselves together but it doesn't really work. That's the truth about Planet Waves, like no-one else here'll tell you.doesn't do justice to the album's enduring track Forever Young."
4,Animalypics - An Underrated Gem,"I was eight years old when this came out; I thought it was slyly clever and funny back then. Now I'm almost thirty and find that the animation, the humor and the subject matter holds up remarkably well. Brought to us by the creator of ""Tron"", it is a wonderful blending of traditional animation and then-innovative techniques that might be considered almost psychedelic for such a normally straightforward medium. With original songs and voice overs from renowned comedy figures, it is truly a great achievement in its genre. I can't wait to introduce it to my niece and nephew, who I hope will be as delighted as I was."
5,Barbara Warbler,"I remember loving this movie when I was a kid. It is extremely imaginative and highly entertaining. It is also pretty clever - the ostrich (I think) commentator is Barbara Warbler, and she talks with a lisp. Granted, I'm pretty sure I didn't really get it at the time, but it is very intelligent humour considering it's aimed at little kids.My absolute favourite part - the Calamari Brothers bobsled team. And the alligator diver guy when he dances like John Travolta. I think I memorised that dance.I am so happy I came across this - I'm totally going to buy it and refresh my memory! If you have kids - you should absolutely buy this and let them watch it over and over and over and over again."
5,I loved this as a kid... saw it on HBO,"I can't wait for them to release a DVD version.My favorite part was the diving scene and the music that played during it.Awesome animation, very funny at times, lots of jokes and also jokes of the time period for pop culture.Jason"
3,"Doesn't work on dvd, only computer","When i red about it, i thought this is great! When i got the dvd, it doesn't work in my dvd player. The company didn't bother to tell me it would work on a computer, not a dvd player. Needless to say, i wasn't happy to figure this out on my own. Im very disappointed. Fortunately, i have a computer. It does look excellent on my computer though. If you have a computer, than this might be okay."
3,It worked...mostly!,"The DVD they sell of this movie claims to be region free. And in some technical sense it may be, but it wouldn't play on my PS3(American). It plays fine on my computer though. Also, why the hell does this cost $40? I paid it anyway, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's worth $40. Glad I found it though. This movie brings back good memories!If you have kids, buy this movie!"
5,Stiill rocks,"The voices, the clever writing... they were really pioneers to today's major films by Pixar and Dreamworks. I still enjoy every frame!"
2,Dissapointment,"I bought this boyfreind for the man I will be marrying; to help him understand his role in my clinical depression. This book is AWFUL. The book treates the depressed person as the ""other"". It is not supportive or encourageing. The entire book is about how their depression will hurt you and how their depression will ruin your life. It is all about the non-depressed person ""protecting"" themself. This book is not at all helpful for a couplke or family faceing depression togeter. The book What To Do When They Are Depressed is much better; much more supportive, and much less scarey. I can easily see how this book would freak out a loved one faceing a family member's depression."
2,Leaves alot to be desired!! Nothing to help sons.,"This book leaves alot to be desired!! There is little or nothing to help sons or brothers of depressed sisters and mothers!! It's draining living with depressed dysfunctional family members,and this book,while interesting,gives short shift to sons and brothers of depressed mothers and sisters!! I have both Anne's books,I've been on her former Web Site,called mentally ill,I'm not-I live with this,I suffer from diabetes,learning disabled,back pain, I guess the title is misleading-oh,they'll survive,me? Not sure. Anne needs to do more research."
5,This book saved my marriage and changed my life!,"As a spouse of a chronically depressed person, I love my husband but hate his disease. I was considering divorce only because I didn't want my young children to be scarred by the nasty affects of his disease.Reading this book literally saved my marriage and has allowed us to set some ground rules that enable us to have a happy family life. Ms. Sheffield's explanations of the manifestations of the disease help the spouse to understand and adjust the enormous guilt and grief that comes from living with a depressed spouse.I have recommended this book to everyone I talk with who is living with a depressed spouse. Her examples offer insight I've found nowhere else. AWESOME BOOK!!!!!"
5,"The most helpful ""depression"" book I've read!","This book confirmed coping skills I have learned through a therapist in dealing with my son's depression. One of the most helpful areas was hearing of the anger of the depressed persons in the book--it helped me to separate the anger my son sometimes shows with the person he is. It helped me to understand it really is the depression that is speaking--the fact that so many depressants are so similar in behavior was very enlightning. I highly recommend it to everyone dealing with a family member who is depressed. I first read it from the library and decided it was a MUST for my ""depression library"". My husband is reading it too!"
2,Didn't like it at all,"This book didn't help me at all, it just make me feel very resentful with my husband. I felt like Anne Sheffield was writing many parts of the book letting out her resentment to her mother, she was not objective and I think at some point it made me feel like a victim. Also I didn't like the tone of the book, it was like she has the absolute truth about the topics. Medications is not the only solution for depression and is not the main solution, my husband used meds to help him clear out his way, but the drugs made him unable to mantain a healthy life, he had night sweats, nightmares, sexual problems because of the medication. Now he is out of them, and was able to go back to have a happy life, drugs are not a solution they are only a band aid. My husband had to dig a lot, work and heal his past to be able to be happy and undepressed and free of drugs."
2,somewhat hostile & divisive,"I found the book to be negative and in some circumstances, over-exaggerated. There are frequent uses of ""many"", and ""most"", and this book generally paints depressives as being difficult, demanding and fault finding. People can have ongoing problems with depression and not be selfish monsters. I think this book drives people apart and looks for blame. I even get the feeling that the author has a deep seated hostility for people suffering from depression. There are much better books on the subject that are much more constructive and STILL focus on the needs of those who are dealing with depressed loved ones."
4,Depression Therapy,Great book! My Fiance suffers with depression and there are many days where I can't understand him and his actions. This book made me feel like myself again and it gave me insight on the illness and reassurance.
5,how you can survive when theyre depressed.,"I cannot praise this book enough. I have been dealing with my Husbands depression for the past ten years. I had been pulled down in to the black hole with him, believing it was all my fault how unhappy he was.This book has made me realise that it's not me, and its not him, its this awful illness he has. On bad days when everything seemed so hopeless I could read another chapter of this book and feel uplifted. It was like someone had written this book about us! It offers no end of helpful suggestions for yourself and the one you love. It has helped me bring it to my husbands attention and encourage him to get help.Fantastic!!"
4,Great book for those isolated by loved ones depression,I was pleasantly pleased with the straight forward information in this book. It was comforting to realize that many other spouses with depressed loved ones are feeling the same way that I do. It's hard to give love and attention that is not returned. Ms. Sheffield is to be commended.
5,A fantastic book,"It is so helpful to know that I can name what I am experiencing, and that I am not alone. The advice and coping strategies in this book have changed my life immeasurably for the better."
1,A MONO DVD release? In 2007?,"While some of these videos are great (and some decidedly mediocre), it is notable that the audio is in mono. The special olympics website about the DVD has artists' names spelled incorrectly.While it is a worthy cause, this is NOT a great product and my suggestion is to avoid it until something better is available. Stereo tracks for all the audio is clearly available, so to release this collection in mono is baffling.I plan to try to return my copy to Amazon, as this is clearly subpar."
2,Not My Favorite,"I know this was a compilation for a charity, but it was too varied for me. My suggestion would be to do one in a mild version and one in the hip-hop, wilder version. I could not show this at my Christmas party because of the wilder nature of some of the video!! After all, it is Christmas, not Spring Break!!"
4,"a very nice dvd - nice songs, but very little. i would wish more because there are so much more xmas songs.",a very interesting dvd - but i think there a too less songs. there are so much more xmas songs and a dvd would offer more place.
3,The recipient of the gift was very pleased.,A previous purchase of the same book proved to be unpleasant smelling. This book is in wonderful shape and has no odor. It was promptly delivered in excellent condition. Thank you Amazon book seller.
3,kindle edition falls short,"As per the previous 2 reviewers, I found the book a fascinating insight into a complex character. However, the kindle edition was full of typographical errors, repetitions and omissions, which made it a difficult read. Pity."
2,"sacred verses, healing sounds","There is more talking than I anticipated, I thought it would be recited verses/songs, but is lots of Deepak talking over background music. I have a hard time listening to it, and would not recommend anyone buying it. This is the first Deepak product I have really been disappointed with."
5,Beautifully done...Highly recommended,"Listening to Deepak Chopra's resonating voice, accompanied by subtle background Indian sitar music, is a healing experience. Also, his brief explanations of the verses is illuminating. I find I frequently play the CDs while working or resting. It is even relaxing to play while cooking :-).I first checked this out as a tape set from the library. It was so wonderful that I bought my own copy on CD. It starts out with an interesting lecture on the use of language and how the Bhagavad Gita is constructed such that listening to the verses raises healing."
3,Very Abstract,"Sacred Verses is very abstract. It is a recording of selected ancient Veda literature translated into English. The verses are very simple. I could have just read the Vedas in book form. I do not receive any benefit from listening to the Vedas on CD form other than becoming familiar with the content of the Vedas. I would not have purchased this CD had I had a chance to preview it first. It is useless knowledge unless you have the intent to study the Vedas. I had initially purchased the CD set to learn about the Vedas, but all I have learned is that the Vedas are simplistic prayers (my prayers are more meaningful). There is nothing to really benefit from listening to this CD set.Chopra, however, presents a clear voice and diction."
4,These shipwrecks are well portrayed.,"It seems to me that far too many books about shipwrecks are cobbled together by people with know nothing about the subject itself. Not so in this case. Clearly Roger Marsters knows his subject and a quick glance at some of the historic pictures reproduced in this book reveals the amount of research undertaken before it was published.Altogether, an excellent account of the major shipwrecks which have occurred along Canada's eastern coast put together in a professional and expert way in which both ancient and modern are skilfully brought together.You would need to read the book to appreciate my final comment which is reserved for it's landscape format and soft cover - neither of which help the book sit easily either on the bookshelf or in one's hands for reading. There is nothing within the content which demands this format and the book itself would benefit greatly from portrait format and hard cover.Otherwise an excellent product.NM."
4,Satisfied Customer,Product availability is good; excellent customer service; fair pricing and reasonable delivery time. Would recommend to others.
5,A guide to Tibetan Buddhist meditation practices,"If you want to learn more about Tibetan spirituality, you need to read this book. You'll also need to read it multiple times, as there will be information you'll get with each reading. This book is especially important if you are doing these spiritual practices as it will provide information that will help you refine those practices. I found the introduction helpful as well in terms of providing cultural context to how these practices are passed on. I do recommend multiple readings as some things may not click in place the first time, and I also recommend reading other books and doing the practices to get further insights into this work."
3,Understanding Ethnic Conflicts,"Would not select for my IR classes. Author obviously well read and knowledgeable about subject. However, much of text gets bogged down in excessive quotations from other authorities and in writing style. In some sections, a mind-numbing read. Suitable and appropriate for a very limited audience. On rewrite, it could be improved."
1,Missing all figures,"This looks like it might be a good book, but my copy is missing all figures and illustrations. This makes it absolutely useless!"
4,Simply great.,"Unlike most fils which tend to show/explain everything, this movie was like a really good book -- it made you think. It was a wonderfully dense story -- (i.e. even the scenes that seemed without purpose had purpose and meaning). A lovely parallel, interesting foreshadowing and an ending that, unlike the professional reviewers contend, was logical."
3,A riddle of a movie,Anyone watching this and expecting a routine crime film is in for a surprise.The film decends into increasing layers of complexity as the accused and the accusers motives rise from the plot.It's certainly a thought provoking film and one that needs to be watched at least twice.Few people will be able to unravel it on one viewing. Recommended.
5,Excellent old school rock and roll with a couple extra little delights.,This is a very hard CD soundtrack to find and I'm so glad I did. This is a great soundtrack that I would recommend to anyone who loves old school rock and roll by some artist I've never heard of but excellent just the same.
4,Good.,"in average, this is an album worth to collect. various artists present different types of voices, some maybe your favourite, some are not, this is why i rate it 4 stars."
5,The pristine elegance!,"Paul Badura Skoda shows us once more about his enormous interpretative talent in this album, playing the first piano sonatas of the lavish Sazlburg's son.His profound musicality and sublime conviction is careved in relief along this album in which you will realize he is one of the supreme authorities in which Mozart's piano music concerns.Recommended without reserves."
2,"Restoring Dolls, A Practical Guide","Although this book provided some excellent information on the restoration of antique dolls, I was disappointed that all of the ""Materials and Suppliers"" were located in England. Referenced materials are not generally available in the USA. The photos were plentiful and the line drawings very useful. The more practical book for a beginning American is ""The Handbook of Doll Repair and Restoration by Marty Westfall"
3,Definately not a best of.........,Pretty ordinary album covering the best tracks up until the Powertrippin' album. No songs are included after that album so it is definately not an album that covers their entire career - just the early years!! Still some great rockers on the album though.
4,"Good, but too short....","This compilation was released in 1970 and was a ""greatest hits"" package confined to Herb Albert & TJB's first four or five records, so it's sadly lacking a couple of their biggest hits, namely ""Casino Royale"" and ""This Guy's In Love"". It could also be argued that a couple of more tracks from ""Whipped Cream"" could have been added, such as ""Bittersweet Samba"".Buy this one at a discount, only... I am glad that the CD repackaging of this retained the original colorful and cheezy cover. The graphic artists used so many different colors in the title that it almost makes your eyes hurt to look at, especially if you look at the LP version. ...and oh, and make sure you own a copy of ""Whipped Cream"", it needs to be in everybody's CD collection."
4,It CAN be taken seriously!,"This is a fun CD. I'm not a huge Tijuana Brass fan, but I remember enough of their music from easy-listening radio and department store muzak to warrant buying this. The more recognizable tracks (Spanish Flea, Taste of Honey, Tijuana Taxi) aren't the only good ones here. For example, Love Potion #9 is turned into a striptease! The songs are fairly short and catchy. After a few listens, you'll know this CD by heart.2 things you should be aware of: First, don't expect any loose interpretations or wild improv... this is very measured, by-the-book playing, which results in some of the most sterile and soulless music you'll ever hear. Second, the recording quality is not that great. It should definitely be remastered."
5,Timeless good fun,"Pop this in and watch your children prance around the living room. You're never tempted to fast-forward to the next track: Everything here is lively and contagious. Bonus: A better ""Taste of Honey"" than the Beatles made."
3,Sheet Set not Complete,"I received my shipment and did a quick look since I wasn't ready to use the set yet. Once I was ready I noticed that only 1 pillow case was provided. The package said 2, but only 1 arrived. Very disappointing."
3,All Text No Pictures,"This is an authoritative well written book, offering sound advice. However, there are no photos of any of the rooms, if you have a visual imagination you'll be fine. If not, you will have to turn to secondary resources to see the interior decor photography."
2,disappointing,"When I first saw this book, I had great hopes for a professional well thought out list. Giving the fact that the author is senior officer in the US army, I guess I expected some professionalism. I was very disappointed. Im not going to complain about the order of the greats on the list, because that is subjective. However, the write decided to include people on the list, that I do not think could successfully lead a herd of goats into battle, like Feidel Castro. Castro might have been a good leader, politician ect but I can not think of any major military contribution he brought to the world. There are other entries like this but I think you got the point.On the up side (there si a samll upside, thus the 2nd star) this book is entertaining. Plus if you take the entries out of the context of ""the military 100"" they are interesting biographies on some histories most interesting people."
1,Is anyone there?,"Is anyone checking the reviews before they are posted? The January 13th ""review"" is asking for corrections of an earlier review. It says nothing about the book"

5,My favorite Supertramp recording,"This album was just good all the way through. I like every tune and they all seem to flow good. From the title tracks almost hypnotic beginning, melodic pace and great vocals to the whimsical lover boy this is a great album. Downstream is soothing and filled with great piano, and so is From Now On. This album (CD) is filled with great melodies, vocals and just great musicianship. The only hit song was Give A Little Bit, which is a good tune but not my favorite here. That might be why its not as popular as Crime and Breakfast, but I like all of the classic Tramp albums and I listen to this one most often out of all of them and its great all the way through."
5,Best Supertramp album ever,"If Supertramp had only recorded this album's title track and the epic ""Fool's Overture"" they still could have made musical history, because almost 30 years after the recording of 'Even in the Quietest Moments' the sound retains its original nature of a classic. To attempt to describe 'Fool's Overture' in words is doomed to failuer, because words fall short when you try to describe a piece of art: such is the beauty of this -in my opinion, the band's best- work, one that at times reminds me (don't ask me why) of Yes' ""Turn Of The Century"" (ironically recorded in 1977 as well) but with a more epic feel to it. If you're in the mood for great live versions of this song and ""From Now On"", I advice you to check out the band's live album recorded in Paris, one of the best live albums you might ever hear."
4,Old Supertramp,"Memorable tracks such as ""Even in the Quietist Moments"" and ""Fool's Overture"" are a delight to the ears. I also recommend ""Crime of the Century,"" and ""Crisis? What Crisis?"""
4,4.2 CLASSIC,This is a great CD. featuring 2 of the BEST songs ever written ('Give a Little Bit' and 'Even in the quietest..). Lyrically that song is gorgeous! Not to mention the 11 minute opus 'Fools Overture' (which i personally think sounds better on 'Paris')... This is a cd with songs that will never get old.. Too bad people forgot how to write good music anymore. Music with passion and feel.. Supertramp delivered always!! especially in the '70's!! Thanks for the great music Davies/Hodgson..
2,Sad departure for Supertramp,"This signaled the end of Supertramp as I liked them. Their previous albums rocked with some serious songwriting and musicianship. This is where Supertramp got on the bubblegum bandwagon, going for AM radio play. I love Crime of the Century and Crisis, What Crisis? Even in the Quietest Moments is downright boring"
5,Supertramp Does It Again!,"1977's ""Even In The Quietest Moments"" finds Supertramp going for a more piano & acoustic-guitar based, orchestral sound (hinted at by the snow-covered grand piano on the album cover), and putting aside their trademark Wurlitzer keyboard entirely. But don't worry, the band still leave room for rock as well. ""Even In The Quietest Moments"" is another wonderful, classic disc from Roger Hodgson, Rick Davies and the Trampers, with such classic tunes as the Hodgson signature ""Give A Little Bit,"" the totally gorgeous title song, the equally-gorgeous ""Downstream"" (a great solo showcase for Davies), ""From Now On,"" and the stunning finale, the 11-minute suite, ""Fool's Overture,"" a true rock masterwork.""Even In The Quietest Moments"" is yet another winner from Supertramp. What more can I say about it---just buy it! :-)"
3,"...hmm, it is really Supertramp's 3rd Classic?","Surprisingly, Supertramp are still not their ultrasilly selves yet (except on the jokingly buddhist song ""Babaji""). Each song is rather nice, all very, long, and all of them leave the listener with something to think about. ""Give a Little Bit"" and ""From Now On"", the known highlights, are both excellent. ""Fool's Overture"", the sprawling ten-minute centerpiece, isn't the best Supertramp composition, but will probably be a lot of fun for all of the progressive rock fans out there. Overall, a weak but formidable effort by the 'Tramps.-NC"
4,Some underappreciated classic songs from Supertramp,"This 1977 Supertramp album was one of those records where Side 1 was so much better than Side 2 that you rarely bothered to flip the record/cassette over. The two gems are the well-known ""Give A Little Bit,"" one of those 70s songs where you start with just an acoustic guitar and add instruments with each subsequent verse (another prime example is ""Lady"" by Styx) and the lesser known title song. There are just so many little qualities to ""Even in the Quietest Moments"" that I just love, besides the great title (for which I have been trying to appropriate for the title of a novel for years): the synthesized bird chirping at the start, the initial interplay between Roger Hodgson's acoustic guitar and John Anthony Helliwell's wind instruments, the building vocal harmonies. I always think of this song as a sort of tonal poem that just sets a perfect little mood. No wonder I never bothered to flip the record over."
2,One of the best of the greatest..,"Every song is a work of art. You can listen to it over and over again. Get's you in the heart. Once a Supertramp fan, always a fan. This kind of music never dies. I've been a fan since 1975."
2,I want to like this band so...,I have tried so many of their albums to find a complete fun package and disappointed here again...guess more of a Alan Parsons Project of playing tunes and being British.
4,peak of hodgson& davies,honestly who could have thought supertramp career would turn short5year later this opus is close to perfection especially babaji& the whole last side
5,Freakin Cool Game!,"I played this game in the dead of night and it gave me nightmares for weeks. If you like scary games and movies, you will absolutely love this game"
4,New & Traditional,"'Circulado' is Caetano Veloso's second album with Arto Lindsey...and you can hear it. Lindsey's influence reminds me of Robert Fripp and Brian Eno's influence on late-70's David Bowie. 'Circulado' starts with some modern, experimental sounds but moves to more songs which sound more traditional, like 1960's bossa nova. That mix foreshadows 'Livro', and mixture of styles and influence seems to reflect Veloso's preoccupation with other kinds of mixture."
2,"Potential, but no characters","The Covenant Rising is a better book in concept than in execution. The story which revolves around an apprentice wizard and an eternal, but ""damaged"" warrior who is the last of his race has great potential in the David Gemmell Vane of fantasy (formulaic, but incredibly real). However, unlike Gemmell, Nicholls doesn't flesh out characters to the point where the reader cares about them. No matter what excitng or horrendous adventures that his characters go through there was no way to ""enter"" the characters and find any real empathy. Although a relatively short novel Covenant drags.Nicholls has taken a page from the David Gemmell school of writing, unfortunately he took the wrong page."
3,Average,"It took me a while to finally figure how this product works. I still have to scoop a bit or bits that are not completely emptied at the side receptacle. There is always dust or remnants that come out and need to be cleaned or sweeped everytime the box is rotated.For the price I paid, it's reasonable. It does use for less manual scooping which is good."
2,"Doesn't do a thorough job, you WILL HAVE to hand scoop","I've been using the large sized one for about 2 months now and although it offers some conveniences it is not perfect by the longest stretch of imagination. The gaps in the grate are too wide and smaller clumps will go through and you will have to scoop the out if you don't wan't your kitties going in poop filled litter. Another drawback is that this needs huge amounts of litter, so you will end up going through a tub pretty quickly. If you fill it abut 1-2 inches from the bottom, some clumps stick to the bottom and will need to be scraped using a scoop.In the end you end up doing double the work you did before, first rolling it over and then scooping whats left in the filterate.Only if the grate had smaller gaps this would be a lot better."
4,Nice!,I like the litter box. It is an easy way to scoop litter without the scooper.Nice color. My kitten likes it and so do I. The price is good and better than if I got it at a pet store.
1,Not good for intended usage,"I want to love this item, i really do. The first few weeks were great. Rolled and worked just as described. Then one day my cat made loose stool and it just smeared all over the box and grates. I had to disasemble it and take it outside to completely hose it down and bleach it. That didnt stop, another semi loose stool and when i rolled the box it just got all over the sides. I now no longer roll it. I just scope as per usual and use the cat litter genie. Forget about the rolling unless you want to constantly take it apart to clean."
3,A bit messy but works as described other than that,This product makes a bit of a mess but it drastically cuts do the amount of time it takes to clean out the box.
1,bending screen broke as soon as I bent it to assemble,"I was so excited to see the UPS man drive up with package- as soon as I found this listed as an easier and cleaner way to handle my litter box, I just had to have- arrived very soon, just opened package, follow instructions and all that was needed was to bend screen, snap securely in place and put cover on- screen bend snapped into 2 pieces as soon as I bent it as directed. I am so angry right now I do not even know how to express my thoughts. I do not drive which is why I ordered this online, to open, have product break, follow these stupid return instructions, be available for the pick up and have to wait further for my ""convenience"" of having a cleaner more sanitary litter box. I am disappointed in the box and Amazon and question my future shopping with them.Extremely unhappy customer-Amy Beth Carducci"
4,Works pretty well,"It helps to look closely at what happens inside when you roll it so you understand the mechanics of it. If you merely follow the directions, you won't get such wonderful results."
4,Easy to Use!,"This litter box is really easy to clean. All you have to do is tilt it side to side, then pull out the drawer. I have had two of these now (I had the first one for two years before the latch broke on it and I replaced it). It seems that this updated model has a stronger latch, so I'm hopeful it won't break as quickly. One problem, if you aren't careful, the litter will leak out of the corner of the pull out drawer (you just have to make sure it's all the way closed before you tip it: I have ended up with huge messes on the carpet)."
3,An OK buy,At first I was excited about recieving this cleaning litter box. Once I got it I wasn't that thrilled. Every time you turn it over cat litter falls out the sides. I guess I thought I would be recieving something a little better quality. Guess I got what I paid for. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone.
5,Not automatic but Perfect!!!,I bought this a year ago. I don't have any problem and it didn't jam. Just spin every 2 days for 1 cat. Once a day if you have 1 or more cat. If you forget to spin your cat will ask you anyways to spin it.
4,Best One Out There,"Very happy with the Omega Paw Litter Box. Very easy to put together and it works well! The only complaint i really have about it is that the tabs on the top that fasten it to the bottom of the pan seem cheap and not sturdy. Otherwise, I really do think its the best."
2,"Nice idea, poor implementation","I saw this litter box online, and thought it sounded like a smart idea. However, it turns out to be less practical than I had hoped.1. The clips that attach the hood to the base are very poorly constructed, so each time I roll the box, litter pours out of the seams and all over the floor.2. The waste tray doesn't quite fit the space properly, so clumps will often roll into the space at the end, or underneath the tray. This means I have to re-roll to catch clumps on a second attempt.3. If you roll too soon after your cat has used the litter tray (and there's a wet clump in there) the clump will stick to the grill, requiring some unpleasant cleaning!4. It's quite small, so if you have a larger cat then it will be a tight squeeze. My orange tabbies do fit in there, but only just.Overall, I would not recommend this product. I now use it like a regular litter tray, just taking the lid off and scooping it, instead of trying to roll it. I find that it's less work that way."
2,Two Stars is Generous,"I am not that happy with this litter box. I only bought it because of the reviews it got here. I thought that since I had tendonitis it would do away with scooping and save the stress on my arm. Well...A lot of the litter sticks to the bottom, making it necessary to bang and bang hard on the bottom to free it, and some of it still sticks. And you can't see what's happening, since you have to keep the lid on. I have had to kneel down with a flashlight to see inside. Then, somehow the dirty litter gets stuck behind the receptacle and boy is that fun to remove.All this banging and kneeling and twisting is harder on my muscles than scooping! I am disappointed; this was a $40 outlay for a product that, once again, fails to live up to its claims."
3,great idea but not for a large cat,"I have a large cat, he is a Maine Coon, and this litter box was too tiny for him. You see, half the box that is pictured is the area where the litter clumps get put into when you turn it on its side. Therefore, your cat has only half the space you think he or she would. The design and concept is a great idea. I have a friend with a small cat and she loves it. My cat got dirty from not being able to properly move around and bury. I have since gotten a covered box with a built in sifter from Van Ness and it was a better fit for my cat."
1,Horrible,This litter box was great for about a month. It seemed so easy - just flip it over and pull out the pan. BUT then when you have to physically clean it with Soap and water and it's a mess. TOO many parts. The litter area is too small for even a medium size cat to fit in. I threw it out today.
5,Simply the best litterbox out there,"Great litterbox!My 23 pound cat fits just fine in the large size litterbox. I highly recommend this one as it's simply the easiest one to clean out there, and I've tried them all.We've conquered the problem of urine getting everywhere as this has a nice hood on it. The litter tracking, well that's a problem if you have a cat. Litter is going to get out of the box on their paws or just from digging. It's the price of having a cat.With this litterbox I've gone down to having one litterbox for 3 cats. I roll it in the morning and the evening and dump the waste into a trashcan. Highly recommended!"
3,Sweetness,"I've decided to change my review from ""Decent"" to ""Awesome,"" (Too bad I can't modify the stars, oops...sorry Omega).Originally I LOVED the concept, but my complaint was that the inside dimensions were too small. Yes, cleaning does take half the time, but I ended up having to clean twice as much to maintain endurable levels of odor and cleanliness for both me and my cats. However, I decided to take another look at it and switched to Crystal Cat Litter despite their recommendation of only using clumping litter.By using crystal litter, I reduced the number of times I had to clean out the litter box since urine doesn't create clumps. And by eliminating the clumps, I also managed to free up more space inside of the litter so my kittens have more room to dig.I know it goes against Omega's recommendations, but I would highly recommend using crystal litter with this box if its tiny size is an issue. I use Tidy Cats Crystals and they fall through the grill perfectly."
1,Flawed execution of a great concept,"Great concept, but as others have pointed out, the execution is flawed. The item is huge but usable space for the cats is cramped so our two weren't very fond of it (and these aren't fussy cats). Unless you roll it several times a day, the scoop drawer overflows and spills litter all over as you pull it out, so you have to hold a garbage bag under it when emptying. The plastic fasteners holding the unit together were weak and easily slid into the unlocked position, so we narrowly avoided a few disasters until we learned to double check them each time we rolled it. We'd read numerous glowing reviews of this product and ended up being so disappointed that we went back to a conventional litter box after a few weeks. Less hassle for us, and the cats were happier. No wonder the price keeps dropping.... I'd love to see them (or someone else) improve on it - perhaps I'd try ""Version 2.0""."
2,Yuck!,"I an a new kitty owner and not an experienced litter box person but I had hoped this would do what it says - namely make it easy to clean the box. It handles all the little poopies the kitty makes and collects in the tray as in the video but all of the ""urine patties"" stick to the bottom of the pan and every day I have to take the kitty shovel and scrape, scrape, scrape and the odor is really bad. So, what is the difference in this box and the cheap pans? You still have to clean it daily."
2,can drive your cat to pee all over your house!,"This box because it spreads the smell all over the box can drive many cats to start ""hiding"" their pee all over your house!"
1,"Good idea, horrible design","I bought this liter box in hopes that it would make my life easier. However, after owning it for almost a year I found that the product design is majorly flawed. The box is not one solid piece, it is two halves held together by plastic clips. While I had no problem with the clips I found that over time every time the box is rolled litter comes out the bottom where the two halves meet. The concept is great, but in order for this thing to actually work properly it should be one solid piece and not two halves. I found this to thing to be more trouble then it was worth because every time it was rolled to clean the box there was a pile of litter on the floor that then needed to be swept up. Don't waste your time with this product."
5,AMAZING!!!! CLEAN!! EFFORTLESS!! PRIVATE!!,"My cat LOVES this litter box. If you have a Maine coon like I do, I would recommend getting the LARGE box. I had to upgrade from the medium to the large when Jackson became an adult.This litter box is SO simple. After I roll the litterbox, I pound the bottom with the heel of my hand just to make sure I'm breaking loose all the wet litter that's stuck to the bottom. I have had this litter box from day 1 and can't say enough good things!"
3,Not for my guys,"I was so anxious for this litter box system to work, but it's back to the drawing board. Even though it's described as ""large"", the actual space inside the box after allowing for the filter area is not so spacious. My male cat refused to venture in, but the females tried to adjust. The final straw was the litter I use (feline pine scoopable) definitely doesn't work with the tipping-over-filter system. It would probably be fine for someone with smaller cats and the usual clay clumping litter.I donated the semi-used item to the local shelter..."
5,Best litter box ever!,"I purchased this item as a gift for my husband, who dreads his litter box duties. I used to have to nag him about cleaning it, but since we have started using this box, it is no problem. He easily cleans the box daily in just minutes! No really, this product works wonders. It makes taking care of the litter box much less of a chore, and you save on litter because you are only tossing the clumps. I would definately recommed this product. And we have tried others, automatic cleaners and all... none of them compare."
4,Best litter box that I've bought,"The litter box is very easy to use. Just roll the litter box over to the side and let the clumps fall into the collection tray. I like to give the box a few taps to get any litter that is stuck to the bottom of the box. The only complaint that I have about this product is that the clips break very easily. I had mine for about 2 weeks and one of the clips already broke. I emailed customer service at www.omegapaw.com and they are gladly sending me a whole set of replacement clips (I guess it happens quite often). Other than that, I would highly recommend this product."
2,Clean litter falls into scooper too,"I tried tipping it over fast, slow, and at a regular speed, but not just the soiled litter falls into the scooper. Lots of clean litter does too, which is just a waste. I have since taken out that part of the litter box and just scoop it out myself. I was so excited for an easier way to clean her litter box, but was thoroughly disappointed."
2,Disappointed; did I receive a dud?,"After looking closely at so many reviews, I thought I'd finally stumbled on the holy grail of kitty litter boxes. But really--- I've found this to be a very frustrating box. I would not recommend it. I've found myself actually working harder; the litter gets stuck in the grid and is really gross. I can't seem to keep it clean enough and I'm rolling it a minimum of 2-3 times a day. The clips that attach the lid to the bottom are really cheap too; constantly coming detached and look like they won't hold up. Sometimes when I roll it litter that is not used falls into it and then I have to put it back in (so as to not waste it). All in all, I'm really not happy with this. Bummer. I should note that I have two cats and this is their one box; I guess I need to have two boxes, but it's a huge box! Anyway, just my two cents."
3,Just not for us,"If my cats didn't like to pee so close to the sides of the box, it would be great. Instead I'm still scraping the sides and scooping. Not really a product flaw, just my cats. I'll probably just end up removing the grate and go back to scooping daily. It's really too bad... didn't notice much litter leakage through the connecting areas, it's easy to use, and the cats seem to like it... but I wouldn't recommend it if your cats are like mine."
2,Over-Rated,"Like many other cat owners I'm all about a way to make the unpleasant process of sifting through dirty litter easier. I was very enthusiastic about the reviews, but underwhelmed by the performance. All said, I didn't find that the box's sorting of litter was good at all, and it wasted lots of clean litter in the process. Also, worth mentioning, the option to roll this large contraption is fine if you have the room for it, but if space is tight, rolling this big boy around may be more trouble than the alternative. I gave it a shot for a few months and then gave it to the Salvation Army."
2,Still searching,"This litter box has a good idea but bad results. The clips on the side are cheap plastic, the folding barrier inside took quite a while to relax enough to fit into the rim grooves. The main complaint is that my cat is inconsiderate and will pee partially on the side or dig down until hitting the plastic before going. Those will not loosen enough to be tipped into the refuse drawer and so the lid has to be removed and the box cleaned like a regular one. It is really hard on the cheap plastic clips so I've now had to just leave the lid off and use it as a normal littler box (but a lot more expensive). If your cat goes only in the center and not down to the bottom then this will be terrific for you. If not, then save your money and avoid this product.I really like the idea and if it can be improved I would consider looking into purchasing a new and improved model. The search continues for the better litter box."
4,would recommend,I bought this litter box for one cat. It's convenient to use and I barely have to scoop at all. If the drawer isn't closed all the way it can leak kitty litter on the floor when you tip it over. Thinking of buying one for a family member with multiple cats.
4,better then a normal litter box,"I like this product for what it does. its so easy to clean out the litter box in one step in stead of scooping multiple times. although im not sure if im using the right litter.. it is a clumping litter, arm and hammer, but my cats pee sticks to the bottom and doesn't come off and i try to use a scoop but its like its glued. ive wondered if there was something i could do to help stop that. i change it everyday. but still the huge clumps of pee stick to the bottom of the box. other then that i love this thing."
4,Fantastic product!,"I am a first time cat owner and it is very clean and economical. Always skittish of cat litter pans and scoops, I never bothered to want a cat until I had recently adopted a sick little stray kitten and wanted to find a clean way to dispose of nasty kitty litter. The kitten (only 6 weeks old) took to it very quickly and loves having fresh litter. This has to be the best purchase I have made so far on Amazon and certainly the most useful."
5,Love it so far! Amazon purchase,What a relief from tearing apart my old litter box scooping out the litter etc etc. I just hope the clips hold up as some others have voiced concern.
4,Solid Product,"I have two cats and made the change from hand scooping to this. Overall this product has done a solid job but on multiple occasions I have had to ""reassemble"" the grate because it has come loose and isn't containing what it should. This isn't a major issue as I prefer to give it a full cleaning every couple of months anyway."
4,Pretty good product,"MAkes the job of cleaning the kitty litter a lot easier. However, it took a few tries before I got the litter depth right."
2,Poorly made,"It's great design and good idea. Simple to use and effective. I really loved it for the first few weeks but then the latch broke and the filter portion of the litter box was getting loose. Now, every time I roll the box, liter seeps out the sides and sometimes the filter/guard flips open and all the liter, not just clumped liter, ends up in the upper compartment/shelf.Like other reviewers have said, I think this would have been a great product if only the quality was better. Faulty latches and filters made this a big pain to use!"
5,litter boxes for 3 cats,These self-cleaning litter boxes are the best thing I have owned for multi cats. They are so easy to deal with; little to no mess at all. I bought 2 of them and with the large size it is more than enough for 3 or even 4 cats. You won't regret getting them.
4,Love it!,"I read tons of reviews on this litter box, and researched other litter boxes as well. My husband really liked the idea, so we decided to give it a try.First of all, we did not get the problems the other reviewers had. The clips locked pretty well, we did not have a problem with the litter dustying up the room whenever we would turn the litterbox. All in all, it was a GREAT purchase. It really does work!I had read the reviews about buying the bigger one, but thought we wouldn't need the big once since our cat is smaller compared to other cat breeds. However, even for our small cat, the regular isn't quite spacious enough.He still loves it though! I suppose I could get the bigger one once he can't fit in the smaller one anymore."
2,"Meh, nice in theory...not so much in practice","A simple, old fashioned box is much simpler. The tabs are flimsy, using the scooping mechanism causes you to waste a lot of clean litter. Litter tends to leak out of the sides. The scoop mechanism does NOT work completely. I just scoop mine manually."
5,Best Litter Box,"Great design!Easy enough to clean everyday. Finally have a reason for all those grocery bags (put litter in), haha.It won't catch really small clumps of litter/fecal matter. You could add a finer mesh to the filter of course.Just do a full clean out every month or so and you are golden. I try to clean it out when I buy a new box of litter."
3,Better than traditional pans,"Wow, this thing is huge! I originally bought this because I had two cats. And they used the heck out of it. But this is huge. You must have ample floor space for this. I like the ""idea"" of tipping it over to collect all the feces into the nifty little drawer, but you have to bang on the bottom to get the clumps loose. And there is no odor control vent, which means I have to sift this at least twice a week.But I don't miss having to clean up clawed up cat liner bags every week. So this is good enough for now, until something better comes along."
5,LOVE IT!!!! Plus AMAZON is the best!!,"I have to say I LOVE IT! I liked it so much that two days after I got myself one I ordered my kids one. My 3 year old Siberian kitty didn't have any problems taking to it. I have been using the littermaid automatic litter box which is a good thought but plagued with flaws. I was on my 3rd one of those at 190 bucks a pop. For now I am sticking with the Omega Paw it seriously takes you like 5 seconds to clean it, its actually kind of fun. I highly recommend it to anyone! I would also like to say Amazon is one of the best companies out there to deal with. The first one I ordered for my kids didn't show up either delivered to the wrong house or stolen off their porch. I emailed Amazon and let them know and within just a few minutes had a response telling me they had shipped out another one, overnight!!!!!! Impressive keep up the good work."
1,Piece of s***,Product said new and not used. I recieved it used with cat litter all over inside of it. If i wanted something thats garbage i would just use a cardboard box. Very dissappointed
4,Would recommend,"I have 3 cats, one being a main coon. This is the second one of these I have bought. I love them. It takes me just seconds to clean it and other than them coming in and out it doesn't make a mess. I also don't have to worry about electronics breaking down or scrubbing sensors. They are affordable and worth it."
2,Not as time saving as you'd think,"With six cats to scoop up after, I had really hoped this litter box would work out and make my life easier. Unfortunately, it didn't. Yes it catches the big, loose clumps and poo in the pull-out tray, but it left the clumps that were stuck to the plastic. Also, one of my boys likes to pee against the wall, so when I rolled the box, the litter clumped to the sifting grates - a real pain to get off. All in all, I was spending just as long, if not longer, having to clean the litter box each day. After a month and a half of fighting this thing, I removed the sifting piece and dremeled off the bottom plastic clips that held the sifter in place. Now my kitties have just a regular jumbo litter box with a window to look out of (where the collection tray slid in) when they do their business. Easy litter box clean-up seems to be just too good to be true. Too bad, really."
2,jury's out; I've got concerns...,"I was so happy when this litter box arrived--an easy roll right, slightly back to the left, and no more digging for soiled litter. I bought it out of consideration for the next cat sitter. However, in less than a month it quit working properly. Now, despite continuing to follow directions exactly as stated, sometimes when I pull out the tray, it's mostly litter. Not always, but twice was aggravating enough. I'm also concerned re' how to actually clean the box. With all other litter boxes, I have followed the instructions of the vet who said to ""Clean their box with warm water and a mild detergent at least once a month, then let it sun dry."" Does that mean I'll have to disassemble this new box completely every month? Is the screen strong enough to withstand being taken apart and reassembled every month? Reading the reviews just now, I'm not getting that others actually clean their litter boxes, but simply change out the litter ever so often instead. Ewww."
4,Satisfied,"Bought this in preparation for bringing home an adopted shelter cat. She took to it immediately. So easy to empty, it really makes a major chore take about 30 seconds. Works particularly well withPrecious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter, 40 pound bagwhich clumps up fast, solid and hard as a rock, so no worries about everything not making it into the collection drawer. Only concern is the clips seem a little flimsy and I worry about how many roll/flips they will hold up to."
2,Not the greatest,"Would send this back if shipping wasn't so high. I have accidendly spilled dirty cat litter a couple of times because it keeps comingapart when I ""roll"" it. And yes I have put it together correctly & made sure it was latched...but the latches have a tendency to come unlatched! It's a great concept if it would just stay together. Maybe I just happen to get a lemon because most people rated it well which is why I bought it"
4,multi cat household,"I have 4 kittens and an adult cat and this was a great buy...Lots of cats, lots of litter and odor. This cuts back on both. Very easy to use and saves on litter...Wonderful!!!"
2,good idea-poor design,"Hi, I have 1 cat who is 5 months old. I have this litter box. I like the roll feature but I have had my box lid come off while I was tilting it to side and litter went everywhere. Even with one cat, I have to clean the litter box several times a day, the area for the cat is just too small, the litter sifter and tray take up 1/2 the space. I do like not having to scoop the litter, but it would be easier if I had an traditional box. The clamps on side are cheaply made and you just have to be very very gentle with this box. Roll it very gently and hit the bottom slightly to loosen clumps. It does not have a filter to stop smells even with lid smells are a problem. It is hard to clean. You end up having to wipe out bottom and tray often, I would love to be able to use this box with a plastic liner but the lid will not stay on if you try to use with a liner. I am going to have to change to different litter box when my cat gets older and bigger."
4,Better than the Electronic Box!,I bought 2 more after getting my first one. I have both sizes. The smaller size gets 5 stars as the clips fit perfectly. I have 2 of the large size and on both the clips do not fit well but enough to keep it together but from reading other reviews I'm guessing this is why they wear out.
3,not quite there,"I was so excited to finally get a litter box that was different. Well I have 2 cats and sometimes the litter clumps against the grating so doesn't go in the tray.I have to manually scrape so this is annoying. I also had to duct tape the side because if there are any gaps you have litter all over the floor when you turn it over. I won't get rid of my regular box yet. I use Fresh Step scoopable litter. If there is another litter that works with this, I would like to know."
2,Not so great,"I followed the instructions and tried multiple times, but I could not get this litter box to work the way it's supposed to. I was loosing a huge amount of clean litter with the clumps and that was not acceptable to me. I ended up taking out the screen and the collection bin and just using this as a regular litter box. Disappointing."
4,"Great idea, can get messy","I like mine, but I wish it was a little more sturdy.when you roll it, litter tends to leak out of the seams, and if you overfill it, it goes spilling out the door.Also, it probably would help to use a high-quality litter. I use a wheat-based litter because it's a little more environmentally friendly and because it can be flushed down the toilet. However, the filtering action tends to break up the clumps if you don't do it a couple times a day."
4,Great self cleaning litter box!,"I use to have the irobot litter box and loved it, but after a year it broke. Not wanting to spend that much cash on a box, this was a fair trade. Very easy to clean and takes little time. I have 4 cats so I have to clean more often. That's the price we pay for our beloved kitties."
2,Too many little flaws,"Bought this based on the glowing reviews, but it didn't work out. I used it with World's Best Cat Litter, which is a clumping litter but possibly too soft for this box. The urine-soaked litter would get caught in the trap and stay there, and since the box is in my bedroom closet, the urine smell would linger. Also, the area in which the cat does his business is really small, since half the box is taken up with the screened off compartment; when he started digging, he would throw litter out the front-facing door. The self-cleaning aspect was moot; sure, I collected a lot of waste in the little tray, but even after emptying it out I still had to dig around to get it clean. I traded this in a for Clevercat Top-Entry Box, which works much better in my closet (no litter getting thrown everywhere)."
4,Not Bad. Worth It.,"I bought this product in order to speed up and make cleaning the cat litter box easier. Well, it worked, kind of. It is a vast improvement over a traditional litter box, but has a few flaws. First, the seperation grid that filters out the clumps is too big, so smaller clumps don't get picked up, and second, you have to clean it more often, since the remover scoop doesn't hold a lot of clumped material. But overall, I would say it was a good buy. PS, make sure you buy good clumping litter. I recommend Arm & Hammer."
2,Decent box,"It works fine, but some litter does spill out when I tilt it. I have to put tape over the seams to keep all the litter in while cleaning."
2,Not well made,"The design is a good idea and it worked well at first. However, the second time I totally emptied it to replace the litter, I could not get the tabs that hold it together fastened back tightly. As other people have noted, they are flimsy pieces of plastic. Unless the tabs are tight, the box leaks litter all over when it is turned on its side.I wish someone else made this design of better materials."
2,Maybe this litterbox has potential?,"The concept for the litter box is great. I've had difficulty in using clumping kitty litter. It won't fit through the grids on the side, so I've been scooping it although the reason I purchased it was to quit scooping! Our kitty also is reluctant to go in the litter box, so I have placed the old one next to it so we won't have any accidents. In retrospect I should have spent more money and purchased a self-cleaning litter box."
4,Good Box,For the price this is a pretty decent litter box. It allows you to clean the box without scooping. I think it would have been helpful if they recommended the best clumping litter instead of one trying different ones until you get the right one.
5,Awesome!! So much easier than scooping!,This box is so much easier than a scoop box. Just roll it and empty the catch all. The key is to not fill it too full of scoopable litter. Would recommend this product!!
3,Not great,I still don't know how this works. Have tried to figure it out and with no instructions to go by I have not learned how it works. They do not send instructions with the package. It came in a timely manner but just wished I could use it for my cats.
2,Not pleased,"The primary reason I haven't liked this litter box is because it is hard to secure the lid to the bottom of the box. It is frustrating to have to close the sliders and if you don't the litter comes out on the floor when you turn it on it's side. Turning the litter box does get some clumps out but it's really easier just to clean it like a regular litter box for me.I read a review that said it ""really works,"" Not for me."
3,Convenience comes with a price,"This litter box is small. You don't realize when looking at the photo, but half of the litter box is sectioned off for the ""self-cleaning"" mechanism. My cat can only actually use an area about the width of the opening. The ""self-cleaning"" happens when you physically roll the litter box upside down (so technically it doesn't do it by itself). The unclumped litter (which is not necessarily always clean) passes through a grate into the sectioned-off part of the box on the righthand side; the clumps roll over the grate and fall into the long tray. It's not perfect and sometimes some wet unclumped litter or some smaller clumps will be left behind, but it does a pretty good job for the most part. However the box is so small that I have to clean it more often. I would definitely not recommend this for multiple cat homes, or even for very large single cats. I will probably end up buying a large Rubbermaid tub and cutting a hole in the lid instead."
2,Broke within a week,"I absolutely loved this litter box, so much so that gave it a second try after the close tabs broke the first time I used it. After the same thing happened with the second box I was back to scooping again. Great design, but closing tabs are too flimsy and you cannot roll it without them. If not for that I would have given it a 5 stars.I had purchased these as a replacement for my LitterMaid automatic cleaning box. LitterMaid used to be really good when the rake was plastic, I had two that lasted for years. When they went metal rakes they never lasted more than 4 weeks before the motor would freeze up.If I was rich I would get one of the robot litter boxes."
2,Great idea - poor execution,"I am giving this product two stars because the idea behind the litter box is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant! The materials used to construct it, however, leave much to be desired. The plastic is cheap and the parts do not fit together as neatly as they should, thus it fails overall.It is unfortunate that the manufacturers can not be bothered to create a high quality product. As I said, the idea behind this litter box is great. It really is. And mine worked pretty well for almost a month before it started to fall apart.I would have no problem paying more for this item, if the construction were sound. Were it meant to last and be more integrated, I would be willing to pay twice as much. The convenience it potentially imparts is amazing. But unfortunately poor craftsmanship renders it useless. I am very disappointed."
4,"Not perfect, but WAY BETTER than scooping!","It's not the perfect solution, but it's way, way better than scooping. Certainly, my kids don't need to be nagged nearly as much as when they had to scoop!! And for the price...I say it's well worth it. Still looking for the right litter to use in it, though."
5,A LIFESAVER!!!!,"This thing is miraculous! My cat was going pee on my bed before I found omega paw on amazon and it was a nightmare. I could not get him to stop but he was so fanatical about having a pristine box I also couldn't keep it clean enough often enough with my busy schedule, cleaning took too long to do twice a day but now with omega paw I can and do! No more accidents with the cat! I'm thrilled! Omega paw is a breeze to use and takes no time at all! Literally it's a matter of rolling the box to one side and back upright again, ta da, your done, box cleaned! I'm not kidding, it's that easy AND the price rocks! I've heard the electric ones breakdown and they cost a fortune, this one isn't electric and it's a great value yet it also truly works like a charm. I'm so grateful for omega paw, I mean, come on, can you tell?"
4,Cleaner than regular kitty litter box,"This item does minimize the amount of ""digging around"" you have to do in the litter box when cleaning. Occasionally, a clump will get stuck to the bottom when trying to clean. I just give it a hard thwack and rotate the bin again. Better than conventional, but probably not as a great as a truly self-cleaning kitty litter box."
5,I love this product!!!,"I will admit I was skeptical of this product. I thought at this price there was no way it could possibly work. I was wrong, the Omega Paw is fantastic. I have 2 cats that insist on sharing 1 litter box, I've tried multiple, because thats what the experts recommend, but they always end up using the same one. I had a routine of scooping once in the morning and before bed. The Omega Paw has reduced the time and gross factor by 95%!! It is so simple and efficient to use I now clean the litter box several times a day. We now have NO ODOR! I have found that the more often you use it the longer your litter lasts and that is a real cost saver!!! I highly recommend this product."
1,save your money,i use it with the top off. it does not work very well the way it is advertised as you still need to clean the bottom
5,The Best,I cant imagine why this has not been invented years ago (maybe it was & I just never seen it).Ingenius tool free waste removal with easy disposal and also prevent kicked up litter fromreaching the floor.
5,Awesome,Works better than I expected. Can't beat it for the price. Saves me money on litter because it doesn't have to be changed as often.
4,So far so good...,"I just got this in the mail today, and so far I love it. I started out looking for an automated litter box, but after reading too many poor reviews I decided that they're all too expensive and break easily. I decided to purchase this one because the reviews were good and it was really cheap. I am very pleased with it, so far it works just as promised."
3,Not so great for large cats,"I bought this box thinking what a wonderful idea. It is, and it works great. However my large cat does not use it as he has no room to move. I bought the larger size also. The box also has a large footprint so places to put it are limited. I would recommend it to people with smaller cats. I have also had no issues with the clips as many others have wrote about and it has not leaked."
1,Messy and breaks,"After reading most of the reviews, I purchased this litter box. What a waste. It will break soon, but the worst problem is that the hole in front is big, and when the cats cover up their mess the litter goes out of that hole all over the floor."
1,Unsanitary and Smelly,When I first saw this litter box I thought it was a great idea. But after using it for about a month I noticed it wasn't sifting right (pee and poo staying in litter area and tray filling with clean litter. Then I noticed the cats were reluctant to enter the box and discovered the entire lid stank of urine and feces. It became necessary to scrub the rolling lid everytime to remove the odor. When a cat enters the box they are not only surrounded by the odor but the germs associated with their urine and feces. Ended up throwing away the lid and using it as a regular box. Not worth the money.
1,Doesn't Collect Anything In Drawer,"I tried this thing many times, and couldn't get it to work for me. The waste does not roll into the drawer as advertised. Not even a little bit. It's just sitting on my balcony now. Waste of money."
3,"great box, but little room","I've had this litter box for about two months now. the concept is great, but it could use some improving. The box works fine, the clumps go into the tray, litter stays in the box, etc., except I feel the box should have more room inside. My boy, Joey, is only 9 pounds, but has barely any room in there. I'll be keeping this box as a secondary box, but will be looking for a larger one that works like this one."
2,NOT BAD - BUT NOT WHAT IT IS ADVERTISED TO BE!,"I've had mine for a week and it ain't what its cracked up to be. Cannot get the top to fully lock down therefore I am unable to ""Self clean"". For a normal litterbox - which this is essentially is because of the problem - it is WAY overpriced."
5,Great product,This is a really exellent product. It is simple and really works well. This makes keeping litter boxes clean much easier.
4,Great concept,"I've used this for a couple of months now. I got the large, I couldn't imagine using anything smaller than this. It does what it say it will do. I do have trouble with keeping it clean though, there are always small bit of dirty litter falling back into to box after cleaning. Like others have said, the clips are cheap and I have had some small amounts of litter spill out while I am tilting the box to clean it.I've never used any of the other self cleaning litter boxes but from what I understand you have to continue to spend more money on those ones to replace filters etc. This requires no replacement filters etc.It's a great concept, they could make a few small improvements to make it perfect though."
4,It's mostly great.,"It works very well. Cleans easily. A couple of things would make it better; would be nice to have a bigger area for the cats to stand in and would be nice to have an opening at the top or side to put new litter in. Even though there's room for improvement, I highly recommend it and it's the best box I've found thus far."
5,Best Litter Box Ever!!,"I love my cats, but I hate cleaning their box. I bought the Omega Paw last month and...wow!!It doesn't get better than this. Roll the box to the right, roll back to the center, tilt left and IT'S DONE. Pull the tray out, dispose, walk away. This box costs the same as my old box which isn't close to being as cool as the Omega. I'd say BUY IT!!!"
4,"Latches stick a little, but so far it's amazing!","I've got four cats, 2 of my own and 2 I'm fostering for a friend while she moves. I looked up the mechanical types of automatic litter boxes, but a combination of mechanical failure reports, clogs and expense made me hesitant. Then I saw the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, and it looked like everything I was looking for. The box arrived very timely, in good condition, and extracting the litter box and assembling it was a breeze...EXCEPT that the latches to lock it in place do seem to stick in place and refuse to slide, despite being oriented into the locking groove. But the box cleans very well, the container slides out easily and is very tidy to dump. There is no odor, and the cats took to the box very easily. I've cut the time I would have needed to scoop the box down by a fraction - totally worth the very reasonable price."
2,Cat litter box,Not overly pleased with this product. Might be good for some cats but was not good for mine. Not that easy to use especially in a confined area. Also seemed like urine leaked outside the unit & messed up floor beneath it. One other problem the waste drawer doesn't stay fully closed when you are manipulating the unit - this causes a problem where you get some of the waste or litter spilling out of the drawer. Good concept - needs some refinements however.
4,Great alternative to the more expensive auto-cleaning boxes,"I decided to go with this manual self-cleaning litter box over the an automated one not because of the upfront cost, but because I didn't want to get stuck buying a particular brand of litter pellets or pads. This box works as described and was easy to setup.The only problem I've seen is that if the cat pees near the side of the box some of the cat litter will get stuck and not properly sift through the grate when you roll the box over. So you'll still want a scooper handy to break those clumps free. It's only a minor inconvenience and overall this box speeds up my morning routine with the cats by several minutes."
2,this box has some problems even with proper use,"Concept is great, and yes this is relatively easy to use. However, after 8 months of use I see that:1. litter is wasted unless you roll it, pull out the drawer, and dump it back a few times 2. it is more effective to use a poop scoop because some small stuff is not removed, and 3. the usable space in the large size is only about 12"" X 15"""
3,keep it up,Works good as long as you clean it a few times a day. If it gets dirty...it gets really dirty!
4,Roll Over Beethoven Cat Bxx,"This cat box is the answer to many of the ordinary problems with regular cat boxes at a very reasonable price. It's much larger than a standard cat box so I'm finding that the ""kitty karats"" are more toward the center of the box as opposed to sometimes being on the edges. It's a simple design that functions like a self-cleaning cat box with very little manpower. Also, unlike the automatic, plug-in type of boxes, this uses no electricity nor does it have any parts that are likely to break down!"
2,Litter sticks to box sides,"I had to get a scooper and scrape the litter off of the side of the box to get it to go into the container in more than one place or bang on the outside to get it to release. The screen also collected small amounts of clumps on the other side and piled up. I did not like this product, returned it."
5,VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!,"Well, I read the reviews and was prepared to try yet another litter box to see how well it worked. It was very easy to put together, the kitties like it, AND it WORKS!!! So, so easy - all you do is tip it sideways and all the clumps fall into the pan for easy disposal.Great value for the price and I am going to buy at least one more very soon!"
5,Great buy for the money,"My cats have had this litter pan for about 2 weeks now, and I think it is a great product for the cost. I was ready to pay $300 for the Litter Robot, but decided to see how this product worked, particularly since it got such great reviews. First of all, I got free super saver shipping thru Amazon, so that saved me some money there. Then, all three of my cats use it, even the picky one, who wouldn't use the Litter Maid because of the loud noises it made. This litter pan isn't heavy, even when it's full of litter, so I have no trouble turning it upside down every day. With three cats, I do have to empty the tray every day, but I would rather do so anyway, to keep the smell down in the house. I think it's a great product and it has saved me money on litter already. I would definitely purchase this product and try it out before resorting to electronic litter pans."
4,Good product,This is a good catbox that eliminates 99% of manual scooping. Once in a while (every week) I still do manual scooping to catch the finer debris that the screen doesn't get. But overall I am really satisfied. I have 2 cats that have no problem using it and it is really easy to clean.
3,Cool Concept,"The whole idea of the litter box is really cool. It really does save time, however if your cats are like mine they urinate on the floor of the box and my cats urine would get stuck to the bottom and simply banging on the box when its upside doesn't always get everything, if anything, off. I really wanted this box to work for us because we have 3 cats, so I have to scoop often. But it just wasn't getting the urine and it would leave the floor of the box dirty. Seems cleaner just to hand scoop yourself. Which I wouldn't recommend with this box because the lid is a pain to take off with all the clips going around the edge. Also I don't know if it was because my clumps were still soft whenever I used it but when I would turn the box and the clumps would fall to the top of the box...they would shatter into pieces instead of staying clumped."
1,Many Problems. Not Worth the Hassle.,"Clumps stick to the bottom, so you have to poke at it to loosen it, then roll it again. Litter leaks out the seams onto the floor. Loose stool plugs the grates. Takes a lot of floor space to roll and unroll. Heavy and awkward to roll around for the kids who were supposed to be the ones responsible for this duty. I'm going to trash this one and try a different kind."
4,Love It!,"I have had several Littermaid litter boxes over the years, and while it's nice that they scoop every time the cats use it, they are a pain to clean and I've never had one last over a year before they burn out. The Omega Paw is a great alternative, as long as I clean it once a day there are no big messes to deal with. I bought the smaller version first, but my fat cat can't fit in it so I got this one too. The only reason I gave it four stars is that unlike the smaller version, this one doesn't have the clips on all four sides which causes a little bit of litter to leak out when you roll it. But, considering the enthusiastic diggers I have, I'm used to sweeping up regularly, and the hood cuts down on the amount they can scatter, so a small amount leaking out isn't that big of a deal."
2,perfect for kitten only,"The litter box is good, but when the cat does the business, it keeps smelly all the time, and its only good for kittens not for adult cats."
3,needs extra room,"hoping to use it in the spring on the porch. will need extra room to clean, because it needs room to complete rollover & back. looks like a good invention. nice color"
1,Waste of money,"I bought this litter box based on the overwhelming number of positive reviews. My experience was that the box was heavy and unwieldy to tip, that much clumping litter (top quality) still clung to the sides because my cat pees towards the walls, and that I had to use a scraper to clean the sides of the box anyway. Because the box design is restrictive, the scraping process and the tipping process resulted in more physical work and hassle than I'd faced when cleaning my old covered cat box. I ended up putting it in the trash two weeks later and I bought another conventional covered box from my pet store. My cat is medium sized and doesn't excrete abnormal amounts of urine and feces. I can't imagine what kind of cats the writers of the positive reviews might have..."
1,Worst litter box EVER!!!,"Having my cat for several years and moving around constantly, I have been through many litter boxes and this by far is the absolute worst! I have always wanted to try it especially seeing all the great reviews and was so excited to get an easy to clean litter box. Far from it! Nothing but problems from day one! The latches on the side do not move easily to lock/unlock the top, the litter gets stuck in the grate and I have to spend a great deal of time cleaning it each day, as well as cleaning up the litter my cat easily pushes out of the box. It is going in the garbage."
1,Do Not Buy This Product.,Amazon will not issue a credit for this product even though the manufacturer is not available for contact. You must waste your time & money to return this product which is half of what you spent on it. Not happy with Amazons Customer Service. Have been a customer for over 3 years and they would not give me a partial credit that I was promised a month prior to calling them about the Defect. Spoke first to a cusomer service rep than his supervisor named Lori with the title of Team Leader. She was rude and sorry never came out of her mouth. Just said I can't help you and hung up. I guess they don't need the business in this bad economy. Hmmmm. interesting. Needless to say We will cancel our account and use Overstock instead or the many other internet stores.
1,Well I tried!,"Well I tried to put the box together right. I followed all of the instructions... I could not get the top to fit on the bottom and could not lock it into place. When rolled, the littler just poured out of the sides. My cat loved to get inside, but as for cleaning as instructed... didn't work. I am SO DISAPPOINTED.... I'll probably use it as a regular cat box... pull the top off and clean with a scooper. I should learn... if it is too good to be true.... it is"
5,Really works.,"This is an ingenious system. Elegantly simple. It takes me about 15 seconds to clean the cat box... the hardest part is scooping more fresh litter in each time! I can count on one hand the number of products that I've been impressed with as much as this cat box; it just does what it's supposed to do, without moving parts, and without fuss. Five perfect stars.Addendum: March, 2012.The cat box continues to be awesome. It still surprises me that it's so easy to use. Changing the cat litter is such a non-event that I often can't remember the last time I did it. That would be my only complaint."
5,The best litter system yet,"I have both the medium and the Large size set up. After I set them up a month ago the 8 cats only use the omega litter boxes. They are fast and easy to clean so I clean them more often. My house always smells good. I do notice a little litter spills when I flip it, it is only a few crumbs and easily swept up. After I flip it, I always smack the bottom side (that is now on top) to loosen any litter that sticks to the bottom. Thank you for making Omega litter boxes, I am a loyal customer."
5,great kitty litter purchased through Amazon,"At first, I put in the screen upside down, so it didn't work. I realized my error once I read the reviews. I reinserted the screen the right way and it works great! Just tip over, slowly tip slightly left, pull out tray and dump! It is so much easier. The cover eliminates kitty litter smell. I think it is awesome! I have 2 cats. This is super easy to clean -- without touching the litter."
5,Quick and Clean!,"It works pretty well. I was hoping that it would make cleaning the litter box quick and it most certainly has. Compared to scooping, it feels like a much MUCH quicker and cleaner process."
4,Works pretty well,"Arrived fast via Amazon shipping. easy to assemble. Just make sure you use enough litter. When the litter runs too low the pee causes the litter to kind of get muddy and stick to the bottom. I don't know if it's because of less air flow than my old open litter box or what because I didn't have that issue with low litter before. Anyway, when there is enough litter it's as easy as they say, roll the box over and back and pull out the tray..done. Sometimes when you get some chunks sticking to the tray you just give the bottom a few good whacks while it's turned over and they usually fall off.I can definitely recommend this product at this price (I paid $32'ish)."
4,Great litterbox but needs one improvement,"This is a great litterbox but needs a slight design improvement or a bit of DIY to get that 5 star rating.We noticed after a little while that litter was leaking out of the right side (as you're facing the opening...the one you roll it on to). Turns out that when you roll it, litter was getting underneath where the ""filtering"" piece attaches into the bottom part of the frame and then sneaking out where the top and bottom half of the litterbox attach (hard to describe exactly but if you've got it in front of you, you will easily be able to see). So, I got a little silicone adhesive and attached it that way...no more mess! Just a bit harder to clean behind that ""filtering"" piece, but...a good trade off in my opinion.Also, first one we got was missing said ""filtering"" piece, but Amazon overnighted a replacement to us and paid for return shipping. Great service as always!"
5,WOW!!!!!,"Again, WOW!!!! This product is everything is says it is. I have had cats all my life and hated the whole litter box thing. OmegaPaw is amazing. It is NOT a ""self cleaning"" box but rather an ""easy clean"" box. Cleaning is simple and takes only a few seconds. NO scooping, sifting etc. The design is easy to fill and keeps litter from being scattered everywhere. Use a good quality clumping litter and you WLL NOT be disappointed! Best $35 I ever spent!"
2,Cheaply made for the price,"This is a great concept and would work really well if it wasn't made with cheap plastic parts. I purchased the large one for $34.99 and it is a struggle to push the tabs that latch the top of it to the bottom. Even if I manage to do that the litter will seep out when I roll it onto it's top to clean it. As I said, it is a great concept and maybe if they work on the design it will make the process easier. Also, there is very little instruction that comes with it."
2,Interesting design,I bought this due to the ratings I had read here. Got it home and didnt realize you practically have to turn it completely over to clean it out. So I returned it since my wife did not like that at all. I wasnt thrilled either.
3,Wonderful at first,"I thought this was a godsend at first. After a while you notice some of the flaws. It is time consuming and disgusting cleaning out the box once a month. There are 4 parts to clean and the grill is the worst. Overtime, litter eventually started to come out a little will every roll. It looks like the plastic weakens where the bottom part meets the top. So I used binder clips to hold it together tighter. Also, it tends to sometimes little clumps of poo trapped in the grill or break up the pee clumps when it bangs on the grill.Eventually I had to move the litter box to a bathroom closet. It didn't fit, so I just went with an alternative product. I couldn't be happier with the new litter box.So in summary, this is not a perfect product. It might be good enough for you though."
2,"more work, little payoff.","Still have to scoop because pee clumps stick to the bottom. Get an automated box, or just get some liners. This product isn't really worth the time or money."
4,Best for larger spaces,"I highly recommend the Omega Paw for those who have the floor space to allow it to be tipped to the right. If you have a tight spot for the litter box, it probably won't work. We have an extra large size, and we used to have a regular size which was replaced. We replaced it because one of our cats has a large bladder and leaves baseball-sized or larger urine clumps which are too big to fit through the opening going to the removeable tray. This was the only problem with it - otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. I also recommend taking it apart every so often to clean and disinfect with white vinegar (not cider vinegar which cats loathe)."
5,Great product,"I wasn't altogether sure about purchasing a litter box online when I couldn't tangibly see it. I'm sooo glad I took the risk! It is incredibly simple to use. Just roll it all the way over, the litter gets filtered from the clumps, and the clumps will fall in the pullout tray. Roll it back so your cat can use the clean litter. I have a bad back so hunching over and cleaning litter boxes always hurt, but this doesn't strain my back at all. I would definitely recommend this to all cat owners!"
4,A good value for the price,"I bought this to see if it would be more economical than the electric one I have. It is fairly easy to put together and does as it describes. You just roll it and then take the collection tray out and dispose of the waste. It is a bit cheaply made, all plastic, and can be a little difficult to close if the latches are not just right. For anyone that does not like to see and/or be constantly scooping litter repeatedly, this is a good solution. Just roll it and dispose of what is in the tray. Both my cats like it and like the privacy the top gives. If you have a shy cat, this is perfect."
4,Works great!,"What a great invention. So easy to keep clean. A plastic grocery bag just fits over the drawer, making cleanup even easier. My only complaint is that the clamps that secure the lid unlock easily. It's still better than scooping. I highly recommend!"
5,Works as advertised..,"So glad I found this litter box on Amazon before I spent big bucks on one of the expensive robotic boxes. As others have said, it is a breeze to use. And with no motorized parts to break or foul, I expect it will last a long time. Very pleased. My only suggestion to a potential buyer is to pay close attention to the sizes of the boxes and consider that versus the size of your cat. I'd guess that an 1/3rd to 1/4th of the box is taken up by the grate and dump tray. I'm glad I erred to caution and went with the large box. My cat is big (and I don't mean fat, he's just a big tom cat) and the regular sized box wouldn't have fit him."
3,Not as great as I had hoped...,"My friends rave about this product, but it seems my cat tends to pee on the litter right next to the screen making it necessary to clean the screen each time I change the litter (defeating the purpose). It's a great concept and much better than those automatic litter pans with the loud and useless motors, but still left me unsatisfied. It may work for you..."
5,Had this for a year and still love it,"I can't believe I spent $30 bucks on a litter box. It's typical of me to do this and then regret it -- but NOT THIS TIME. I love it. I recommend it to all my friends. It really works as it says, and you never have to touch the litter. Amazing."
3,"good, but needs improvement","After researching all the litterbox options, this seemed like the best one for our 4-cat household. I like it in that it does significantly cut down on your contact with the icky parts of the litter, and all the cats took to it right away. I don't like the cheesey plastic ""locking"" clamps, which don't adequately seal the box shut, resulting in lots of (clean) litter leakage when you roll the box. Surely they could upgrade to more substantial clamps and some sort of soft sealing strip to solve this problem."
3,"concept good, constuction not so great.","Bought the Omega Paw self-cleaning box for one cat that is afraid to go to the basment in the dark!! The concept is really great, but construction leaves a lot to be desired. Three of the clips were stubborn and one will absolutely not slide. I have to hold the whole box together while trying to roll it. Litter spills out most of the time. The enclosure is good for the cat who has a habit of over the edge peeing. I have had to spray some odor nuetralizer a couple times even though I use good litter. I have only had this box about a month, and just wish it would stay together!"
5,I'm happy; kitties are happy,"The old litter box just wasn't working for any of us. So, I searched for the perfect replacement and found it with the Omega Paw self-cleaning box. Kitties took to it right away, and cleaning out the litter is so easy and non-messy. Kitties and I have recently traveled to a summer home, and I'm adding a second Omega Paw so there's one in each house!"
1,bad product,This litter box leaks when you tilt it the top doesn't stay on right all in all this is a total waste of money I ended up throwing it away save your money .
5,Great Product!,"My husband, the engineer, was very skeptical that the Omega Paw self-cleaning kitty litter box would work, but when we got a second cat, he decided to give it a try. It is an amazing product; works just like the description and we are totally pleased."
5,Litter boxes,"I love these litter boxes, they are so easy to clean with little effort. I now have 3 of them in the house for my cats no one can smell that I have litter boxes in the house. They are the best litter boxes I have ever had. I would definitely buy them again. They came in just a few days, in excellent condition. Thank you amazon!"
3,Decent Litterbox,"I think this is a pretty good litter box if you don't mind attending to it on a daily basis. I ended up going back to my old litter box due to that fact. I had to buy this one just to see since I was looking for something ""easier"". You win some, you lose some I guess."
5,Easiest litterbox ever,When assembled properly this works exactly as described. It's so much easier than scooping and the cats seem to enjoy the privacy.
4,"I like it, my cat does not","This litterbox is a good product & easy to use, but after using the electric-type litterboxes for so many years, my cat has become very spoiled. I roll the box 3 times a day & that is just not good enough for her. She is 17 years old & is quite used to having a ""clean"" box when nature calls. I'm giving the Omega box to a friend who has always used manual litterboxes."
2,Self Cleaning litter box too flimsy,I have owned this product for several years now and while I love the concept the execution of the design is very flawed. My major issue with this litter box is the way the top attaches to the bottom. The sliding retaining slides are way too flimsy and I broke one soon after purchasing the unit. Now I have to be careful when emptying the slide out tray so as not to spill litter all over the carpet because the top is no longer firmly attached to the bottom. Also it makes no sense that the entire right side of the box has no latches at all! Very poor design. This could be easily remedied by extending the lip on the right side of the unit and attaching two locking slides. The way this thing is presently designed it is way overpriced.
1,Not a good buy,"This litter box does not work with cat litter that clumps; the grate is too small. While the feces do slip into the removable pan, the clumps remain in the main chamber. So now instead off lifting off the top of my old litter box (which I am going back to) I have to unsnap the top of the box, get out the scooper and clean out the clumps of cat litter. Twice the amount of work as with the standard litter box. I was thinking of enlarging the grate to allow for larger clumps but that should have been thought of by the inventor."
3,not the perfect box,"After using this box for 2 weeks I am inclined to go back to my old litter box. The latch in front doesn't close properly, the screen inside comes apart at times, some bits and pieces pass through the sifter and finally some litter get past through the joints."
4,omega paw self clean,"good product, had little trouble getting put together. it is easy to use clean do not have to touch litter. Recommend to use clumping litter. could have bought smaller one takes up a lot of space but I am glad I bought it best litter box"
5,Cleaning cat litter made easy,"I wish I had purchased this years ago because it make the arduous task of cleaning cat litter, dirt simply. It replaced 2 litter boxes and has made my life so much easier. And the simplicity of the design and required action to clean their kitty litter is so easy. This is a great product for cat owners."
3,Actually not great for big cats.,"We have two big cats. Maine Coons to be exact. This was fine when they were kittens, but now that they are almost a year old and nearly 13 lbs, and this just does not cut it anymore. It is hard for the cats to get in, and the lid is too short to allow them to do their business comfortably. Also putting the lid on and pulling it off all the time created a lot of wear on the slides that attach the lid. We ended up breaking one of the slides, and then the lid was not safely on anymore. We now just use it as a small pan, and we got a good scoop from the pet store. The cats only use the Omega Paw one every once in a while, and prefer the XL pan we got them.If you have one, or maybe two, small cats then this might work for you, but this does not work for our big boys."
4,Omgea Paw Litter Box,"I like this product very much, it could use a better grade of plastic, I thinks its a bit flimsy. I also think the clips can be a little bit strudier as well. But all in all this seems to be a great concept, I don't think I will mind cleaning it out daily..Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Pewter"
5,BEST CAT BOX EVER!!!!!!!,BEST CAT BOX EVER......EVERYTHING EVERYONE ELSE SAYS IS TRUE ABOUT THIS CAT BOX. I HAVE ALREADY RECOMMENEDED IT TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS. CATS LOVE IT AND NO SMELL AND LESS WASTE OF LITTER. WORTH EVERY PENNY IF IT!
1,Very disappointed,"This product had the best reviews but the performance was not at all verygood. I found it very awkward to roll the litter box. You still have tobend down and tip the litter box all the way over to get the clumpsinto the pull out tray. And that's the clumps that aren't stuck in thelitter filter piece, which gets easily clogged and is not reallysomething I want to deal with cleaning. Besides not all clumps goinginto the tray, lots of unused litter ended up in the tray as well.Also, I bought the 'regular' size one and the filter piece goes almostright in the middle of the space so the usable cat space was verysmall. Needless to say I returned the litter box and was so glad tohave the old fashioned scoop litter box."
1,"Great idea, poor construction","I love the way this litter box works, but the plastic tabs which connect the top to the bottom broke within the first week. I've had quite a few of these boxes over the years, and they have all lasted a long time. However, I'm afraid the manufacturing process of these has been changed and the quality has deteriorated. The two I've purchased most recently apparently have more flimsy tabs and both boxes have had the same failure. I will not be purchasing these boxes again, though the cleaning system is great. Such a disappointment as I was once a loyal customer of this brand."
2,Cool at first but novelty wears off,"I liked this box at first, the idea of throwing out the scooper was very appealing. Problems: It takes a lot of space to use this box because it needs to be rolled, so no hiding it in a corner or in a closet. When rolled, litter from the drawer will leak a bit on the floor which is gross. My cats concentrate their pee in one spot, so rolling doesn't seem to dislodge that soggy mess. I ended up using my hand with a plastic bag over it to pull the pee clumbs out since I threw away my scooper - super gross! Conclusion: I went to the pet store and bought a regular cat box with hood and a cat scooper. Its just easier."
1,Wonderful design ruined by shoddy manufacturing,"AS SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID: THIS IS A TERRIFIC WAY TO DEAL WITH CAT EXCRETA. HOWEVER, AS SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID: THE LATCHES ARE TREACHEROUS.I HAD TROUBLE CLOSING THEM SO I ASKED A FEW OTHER PEOPLE TO TRY.FINALLY ONE GUY WITH VERY STRONG HANDS GOT THEM TO CLOSE.BUT THEY POPPED OUT AGAIN A FEW DAYS LATER WHEN I WAS ROLLING IT OVERAND ALL THE LITTER POURED OUT ONTO THE FLOOR.THEN THIS WEEK, THE SCREEN THING SPONTANEOUSLY DISLODGED. I'VE TRIED TO GET ITBACK IN PLACE BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO. THE RESULT IS THAT IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL: THE DRAWER IS FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH UNCLUMPED LITTER, AND THE CLUMPED SUBSTANCES REMAIN IN THE MAIN UNIT.PLEASE MAKE A STURDIER MODEL. I'D RATHER PAY MORE FOR THE PRODUCT AND HAVE IT WORK."
3,Good but not great,"This product does the job it claims to do but do not over-fill it or it won't sift the entirity of the litter. Also, make sure the clasps are locked completely because they are very poorly made. It would be better if there were a grate on the bottom so the dirty litter doesn't stick to the bottom. But the good thing is the cat is covered and has privacy. The litter box is huge though so be prepared and have enough room to roll it!"
5,"By Far, The Best Money I've Ever Spent on a Cat Box!","I've tried the LitterMaid and the LitterSweep Automatic Pet boxes, they are noisy, hard to clean and eventually break (about 6 months to a year). The CatGenie and LitterRobot products are too expensive at $300 each but, honestly, you realize quickly after 1 week with the Omega Paws RA20 that you don't need an electronic box. Just fill it with litter and ever 1-2 days to a simple roll and dump the contents into a plastic tray. No scooping. Because it's makes cleaning the box so easy, you tend to do it more often (because you don't dread doing it). For my household it's eliminated the smell, my 2 tom cats are happy as can be and my back no longer aches from cleaning the cat box. Don't wait, order this ingenious cat box today. And no, I don't work for Omega Paw - just a thankful customer."
4,Love It!,"Love this thing! THe cat loves it too. Quicker cleanings and less litter waste. Only drawback is when I need to clean it, must let it dry thoroughly. I wash it out right after she has used it, and towel dry it, otherwise the vents will get clogged. I don't think my litter clumps very well, but the screen does a great job."
1,Cat pee everywhere!,"With all the surface area within the box, there is plenty of places for urine-soaked litter to be trapped, as well as urine to leak through the cracks. It smelled horrible of cat urine and we couldn't figure out why until pulling the top off of it. It would require a full cleaning of all of the surfaces of this box and its top to remain to be use-able, which completely defeats the purpose of it being an easy, ""self-cleaning"" contraption. Most reviews are likely from people who just bought this. I'm reviewing after a couple months of having it, and it was NOT a good purchase."
1,Waste of money!,"This product is so poorly designed, awkward and does not work like it says it would. The top is nearly impossible to secure. When you roll it the litter goes into the vented compartment and the waste sits in the bottom. It does not go into the scoop. This is the biggest waste of money."
3,NOT a SELF CLEANING box,"This product is a manual roll and scoop litter box. If you are looking for a ""true"" self cleaning with motorized cleaning, this product is not for you. But if you don't mind rolling the box every time the cats use the bathroom this would be perfect for you."
1,Prrrrrrrr!,"The concept is good but when the litter starts to come out from all over, it is a mess!! Both sides do not stay together longer, the weight of the litter and excrement wears off the locks.It lasted one week!"
2,"nothing automatic about it, takes up too much room","I bought one of these from another company and tried it for a while.The words self-cleaning gives you the impression it cleans it's self. Far from the truth.. You have to roll it to clean it and that takes up a lot of space which wasn't very practical in my laundry room, I had to open the door and roll it part way in to the hall way. It doesn't hold very much litter and wasn't very suitable for multiple cats. It has to be cleaned EVERY day because it holds so little litter and it only sifts the litter for you in to a pull out drawer which often large clumps would not fit into it. In the long run what looked like a good idea turned out to be more trouble than it was worth. Mine ended up in the garage, if your in Phoenix I'll sell it to you cheap. If you have one cat and lots of space to roll it over and don't mind emptying the drawer and are dedicated to doing it every day 365 then this might work for you."
1,Dont waste your money,"You might as well buy a regular litterbox. This omega is actually messier than a regular litterbox. When you turn it, litter goes all over the floor. The box that collects the clumps gets full after 2 or 3 uses, depending on how much your cat goes. I have 4 cats and he box itself is too small for 3 of my cats to fit in. It has to be turned every single time your cat goes otherwise the clumps do not fit into the collection box. The grill gets sticky and gummy and has to be manually cleaned at least once a day. I used mine for about 5 days before I threw it in the dumpster out back. I didnt even offer to give it to anyone because it was worthless. Oh, I used ther ""premium"" clumping litter and it made no difference."
1,Save Your Money,"I recently purchased The Omega Paw RA20 Self-Cleaning Litter Box. I can assure you it is not self cleaning. The tray where the litter is suppose to accumulate for disposal is positioned so that it is absolutely useless. I still have to clean the box just as I did the old one. The Omega Paw RA20 Self-Cleaning Litter Box does not live up to it's claim!!!10/25/2006 - I must apologize. It was user misunderstanding. I didn't understand that I needed to turn the litter box upside down in order for the waste tray to work. Needless to say, I am happy that I no longer have to scoop litter, but I find that I have to vaccum after each cleaning. All-in-all I will give it 3 stars."
1,Total waste of money,"I've had this box for several years, and it has never worked! Though I had no problem securing the lid so that it stayed on and did not spill litter when I rolled it, the fact is, the tray barely catches anything and leaves a lot behind that still needs to be cleaned up. Additionally, a lot of cats (mine included) do not care for a lid as it makes the box retain more odor, so I had to leave the lid off. Now I just use it as a regular litter box, but the little grooves where the tray is supposed to go get all mucked up and are hard to clean. I give up. I'm going to try the Breeze - hope its not another waste of money!"
3,Nice Idea,"I love the idea of it.. The problem I have is how it's put together and held together. I will tip it and then if it decides to not hold like it's suppose to, I have a mess of cat litter to pick up. Still working on how to keep it together.. I do Love the idea and will think of ways to make it work for me.."
2,Poor quality.,Very hard to assemble. Plastic not molded right. Tabs were poorly aligned. Strange smudges in the plastic. This design wastes more cat litter. It does not separate well.
5,"So simple, so inexpensive and so wonderful","We have had this for a week and LOVE it. Went through 3 Littermaids, the latest model is horrendous (see that review)and needed a new option. With so many reviews and such a high rating we just had to try this. My husband was skeptical because of the price and simplicity of the design, but he is won over now. Literally one puts in together in 1 minute, adds litter and it is ready to go. No batteries, water, electricity needed. Cats are happy. People are happy. The world is good. Cleaning the litter box has never been easier...roll it over and then back, pull out the drawer, dump the kitty treats, put drawer back and the box is all clean. Buy this box."
3,"It's okay. Urine sticks to bottom, smells bad, and doesn't catch everything","For $30, it's worth it, but I wouldn't pay anything more. My cat's urine sticks to the bottom of the litter box, the screen does not remove small pieces of used litter, and it ends up smelling very bad. I much rather scoop manually to not deal with the smell."
3,Mixed feeling about the litterbox,"PRO:The box looks nice and is quite sturdy / solid in generalSeems to contain odors wellLove not having to scoop all clumps out of the box!CON:The clips are not that well made, and I can see why some reviewers complained about themClumps of waste still stick to the bottom, so you are not really free of scooping 100%. Still have to remove thesefrom bottom of the box"
