2,Special Effects Not So Special!,"Here is a case where (in my opinion) special effects ruined what could have been a great film. I am very enthusiatic about the use of special effects when they enhance the quality of a film; and indeed sometimes they are an essiential part of todays movies, but enough is enough! The jolting, jerking around within this film was so distracting I could hardly bear to watch it. The sad part is, someone didn't know where to stop! These annoying interferences went on throughout the entire movie. The plot was not that bad; the story line was interesting, and the movie itself had the potential of being a very exciting thriller. The acting was good; the action was good, and where aptly applied the special effects were very realistic. I have to say I was very disappointed in the film because of all the interruptions, which I put down to very poor editing and some very shoddy attempts to be artsy. Too bad. I would have really liked this one."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This was a good story, and they could have done so much more with it. I found this movie to be quite slow and boring. The character development is terrible, a lot of the acting is poor, and the cinematography, just makes things that much more confusing. I love Denzel Washington and when he teams with Tony Scott, it's usually magic, but they missed the mark in a big way on this one."
4,hypocrisy,"Some people will give any movie 5 stars just because it has Denzel Washington in it. I only gave it the high rating that I did for the violence (im a horror fan). Otherwise the movie was slow. You know what kills me? The conservative hypocrites that wont watch violent movies and then review and bash violent movies, but as soon as Denzel Washington stars in a violent movie, they praise it. People are dorks!"
2,Too slow for a revenge flick; fast forward to the revenge,"It's a slow burn for the first half, and it's half an hour too long, although when it kicks into revenge mode it gets more satisfying - if you can stomach people losing digits and such. An interesting challenge to opponents of the death penalty, if nothing else. Good performances all round. Weird captioning thingy going on (you'll see).Much too slow and ponderous, but maybe this movie'll give Mexico a black eye regarding its corruption and kidnapping rackets. It's hard to believe Mexico City cooperated in the making of this movie."
1,Save your money. Buy the Pelican Brief instead.,"The only thing that gave this DVD any value at all was that it starred Denzel Washington. Without him it would have been almost totally worthless. It was poorly written and didn't flow smoothly at all. The beginning dragged on and on and on. The plot was interesting but easy to figure out very early in the movie, i.e. police/government corruption and all the bad guys were tied together in some sort of gangster brotherhood. Lots of gratuitous violence, but I've spent time in Mexico and unfortunately, much of what is portrayed is very realistic as is the corruption/payoffs among government officials and the Mexican police. Save your money or buy an old copy of The Pelican Brief. Denzel Washington was awesome in that movie and it had a great story line that flowed smoothly."
1,Rubbishy Movie Wallows in Gore and Gratuitous Violence,"Does Denzel really need the money so badly he's willing to take roles in rubbish like this? This sickening film has little to recommend it. A bodyguard's momentary inattention allows kidnappers to grab the little girl he is in charge of. Instantly--because of a turn in the plot--the police, the parents, the press, and the bodyguard assume the child has been killed by the kidnappers. The movie is hawked as a ""revenge"" movie, an excuse for Denzel's characer Creasy to mutilate, blow up, torture, slice off human parts as a way to asuage his anger at--I guess--having done a lousy job of being a bodyguard. Unadulterous trash. The people who put the talented little Dakota Fanning in this should be subjected the treatment Creasy dealt out to his victims."
4,Heart-wrenching fast-paced thriller,"I viewed this on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player. Transfer is a 4/5 on PQ and 4/5 on AQ. This will probably take its place among my favorite Denzel Washington films. While it is highly stylized in shooting style, the story and relationship between him and the little girl and his redemption made this an above average thriller. Dakota and Denzel are outstanding, and this film is a nailbaiting rollercoaster ride to the end. Highly recommended."
4,Rich Thoughts,"The book covers the Letter of Paul to the Ephesians (New Testament). We used this book in a small home bible study. The format of the book makes it easy for people to read the chapter and do the questions at home and then to come to the bible study prepared for discussion. The book content and our answers to questions were a good springboard for some very interesting conversations among us. The chapter questions aren't always ""the best"" (rumor has it Wiersbe did not write them himself), so I recommend you provide yourselves the flexibility to dispute the actual question (which also lends itself to good discussion) -- maybe even skipping a few or rewording a few. As a group, we got so much out of using this book, we have decided to continue with other Wiersbe ""Be"" series books."
5,What other glue is there?,"Like the title of the review says. ""What other glue is there?""I just love this stuff for general woodworking.Of course there are other brands for specialty projects (Gorilla...etc) but for the basics you can't beat this."
4,Good Stuff,"Good general all purpose gluing for most wood projects, but if you want the maximum hold get the Titebond II"
3,Not much help.,"This book was an average review. Reading through it was not a waste, but I would not want it to be my only study source. The Cliffs Test Prep is much more comprehensive, organized, and provides several full-length practice tests. If I knew what I do now, I would only purchase Cliffs."
4,Good Quick Summary,"This product is very short and consise. If you are looking for a quick review in a few days this one can do it. If you are looking for a thorough review this will not do it. I would recommend getting this book along with purchasing the PLT book published by the PRAXIS company. Also, the PLT flashcards are very good."
5,Pass the Praxis II (R) Test: Principals of Learning & Teaching,"This is an excellent source of review for Student Teachers getting ready to take the PLT. It is a great resource, easy to understand, and to the point review of what is needed to prepare for the test. A great Buy!"
5,Pass the Praxis,This book is a comprehensive guide to passing the Praxis II PLT. It helped in both my Ed Psych class and prepare for the test.
4,Fun for Breakfast,"I purchased this pan as a gift for two friends and one for myself. It makes for a fun or special breakfast time for my family. The pan has held up pretty well (I purchased it about 3 years ago, but am just now writing a review). It is tephlon, so there are some specs where it's come off, but no biggy. The hardest thing about using this pan is actually getting the pancakes flipped. I usually use a fork and spatula as I'm not very coordinated (thus the missing specs of tephlon). Make sure you use lots of Pam, oil or butter, it really helps the pancakes come up when ready. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase."
3,Smaller than expected but well made,This tiger is smaller than expected for the price but is well detailed and appears to be well made. Our Grandaughter was delighted.
4,A Must for Jules Shear fans,"If you liked Jules and the Polar Bears, you'll like this recording. If you liked Watch Dog, you'll like this recording. Power pop with a touch of funk, and lots of guitar, and of course the voice of Jules. Shear's writing is very strong too; at times, it is as strong as anything he's written (""I Tried To Please Her"" and ""I Wake Up Loving You"")."
1,I'd like to return this item for a refund,"Wow! This 2-disc anthology stinks!Most of the tracks sound like someone else trying to sound like Bow Wow Wow. Why didn't they use the originally-released recordings, instead of what sound like demos or outtakes? Copyright restrictions, I imagine.Very very disappointing."
5,Insight for Horse Lovers,"Tim Ware obviously has an affinity for horses and his thoughts on understanding our equine companions reflect this.This video offers valuable insights into how we might provide a better environment for our horses and as a result improve their well-being and health. The concepts are presented in a clear and easy to understand way from a unique perspective.There is a companion video Understanding the Hoof, which I would recommend watching first. It goes into more detail about Mr. Ware and his background and provides a most informative look at the basic structure of the horse. It provides a strong context for this video as a follow up.I recommend buying both and starting with the hoof."
1,Review of Understanding the Horse DVD,The author is an anti-science and anti-modern medicine type who says not to vaccinate horses. He also thinks parasitic infections in horses are natural and horses should not be given worming medication. He doesn't think that horses benefit from a walk-in shelter from the rain. I recommend NOT buying this video. Vaccinations are a triumph of modern medicine.
4,GETS JOB DONE,"It's fun to grill the potatoes, but I don't think they come out better than using your oven. It's more of a convenience/novelty item. Would be better if you could make more than 4, but cutting cooking time is a good idea. After they cook and yoiu open them, there is a brown burnt-like skin that forms on each half as a result of the metal spoke used to internally cook potato. That bothers me, but my husband doesn't seem to mind. I have to cut it away."
3,READ ME!!,"If you are buying this unit because of price and features beware! I can tell you as I am looking at the product right now the discription ""Continuously display the charging current or battery voltage on the LCD digital meter"" does NOT apply to this unit. But the discription below it ""Automatically indicates the charged condition of your battery on the LED bar graph"" is accurate. So if your good with that buy it. I haven't used it and I'm not going to so I can't comment on how it works, but the other reviews seem positive."
2,keep looking,"stopped working in under a year (no output). My xantrex charger lasted over 10 years, and I found a new 30A model for $85"
5,Works great with our solar panels.,"We bought this to replace a unit that went bad after 2 years of use. It works great with our solar panels, and was fairly easy to install."
5,Excellent,"This is third in an ongoing story of the baby kidnapping ring, whereby new mothers are coerced or forced to give up their babies to a criminal element that operates in this country. Since we all know that this is based on real happenings, that many hospitals have high security for newborn birth units, it speaks to the very real truth of infant kidnapping for sale to customers that can pay high fees. Hurrah to the authors for looking a a very scary subject!"
5,The book was outstanding,I recommend this book to anyone looking for good reading. Hotchner is able to hold your attention throughout the story. He makes the 1930's a pleasure to be a part of.
5,This book will blow you away!!,If you like Kushiel's Dart you'll absolutely love this book. Pick it up! I can't wait for part 2 to be out!
1,Horrible product,"ABC wholesalers misrepresented this product....offered to send correct replacement. Do not have any customer service at all and when I finally had to return they rudely declined to offer a refund for the wrong size. I would not suggest any purchases from these crooks. I received an angry telephone call and there was no love from these people, only anger and deceit. BUYER BEWARE. Amazon should drop these creep immediately."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this a month earlier, to give to my son for Christmas and he opened it up and it didn't work at all. Said Error"
5,BUZZ LIGHTYEAR,ITEAM WAS IN VERY GOOD SHAPE AND WAS GOT TO ME VERY FAST. WAS VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE.
1,"no story, a lot of violence","My 3y old kid loves toy story, and especially BuzzSo what a disappointment:First of all this is cartoon-like, not animation type.Second of all there is no story at all, except the usual simple plot: ""good guy searches for bad guy, and eventually gets him""Apart from a couple of scenes like the first one, there is no humor neither (nothing like the real toy story). On the other hand, there are endless (and unexplained) scenes of laser fighting, explosions, etc... Violence at its best, that is without justification, and going on and on...From my son's own words: ""it is a bad movie"" (to him, it means that it is a violent/scarry movie and not fun to watch)Definitely a bad experience."
1,Way too Violent,"We turned the movie off after about 10 minutes of non-stop shooting, fighting and other violence. My 3 year old boy was scared and wanted it off. My 4 year old boy liked it a little but we had to explain to him that shooting and hitting were wrong and that this movie was for older kids.Disney (who seems to love violence in their films...e.g. Mulan) should have had a big fat warning on this DVD that it was not for young children or for parents that want to keep their children from being de-sensitized to violence. Parents who show children this film then wonder why the kids beat each other over the head afterwards should get a clue.Keep your money and wait for TS2 on DVD in October."
1,DVD does not work,"The DVD does not work in my DVD players. It is a Region 5 DVD which means it works internationally, but not in the US. I wish they were upfront about this. What a waste of money."
1,Product not intended for sale in the USA,I wish I had read the product reviews before purchasing this DVD. It won't play on my player because it was manufactured for distribution in the UK. At least it was cheap-- now I know why :(
4,not bad,my son likes this movie- sometimes wants to watch and rewatch it... but from a mom point of view- once a week it about all i can take!
4,"NIce show, but a little much for younger toddlers","That said, this is something that is a great continuation from the Toy Story movies. It is a cartoon and not computer animation like the Toy Story movies, in case you're wondering. It's interesting - how they kill off Buzz's sidekick and gives him a new one. But it really is a bit much for the younger toddler set. I guess I wouldn't recommend this much before age 6. It really involves a plot that is quite long and gets a little boring. I'm not sure that I'd watch it again and my little guy actually wanted to watch something else. He LOVES Buzz but this movie just wasn't up to par. The story basically served as an introduction to a series, but still, it could have been better and more appealing to the younger crowd as well. Again, I wouldn't get this for a toddler. It's just a bit much and too boring for them."
3,Not even near it's predecesors...,"I bought this dvd for my 20 month old son. He loves the Toy Story movies (He watches them an average of 3 times a day, I kid you not) and he is a big Buzz Lightyear fan. He seems to enjoy this little flick but not as much as the others. As a parent, I enjoy the Toy Story movies, but this one kept me empty. Something was missing. The jokes weren't there, and the story needed a little more developing. It feels much more like a 30 minute sunday morning cartoon than a movie of its own. Nevertheless it has its moments, and if my son likes it, its enough for me."
1,Falseley advertised,"The DVD arrived on time but when we tried to play the DVD, there was an error message stating ""not authorized for viewing in your region"". This happened in all 3 of our DVD players which play any standard DVD. WHy is this for sale in the US? I have never had this type of problem with any store bought or rented DVD. Very disappointed as this was my 4 year old's first birthday present he opened and he wanted to watch it immediately only to discover it was not authorized for viewing in our area. Try explaining that to a 4 year old...."
3,Haven't watched it yet.,"I paid $5.00 for this only to find out that it was coded for Europe. My bad, should have read the description a bit more. I'm sure it's great but the U.S. version is $40.00. I can buy a European coded dvd player for $50.00 with free prime shipping."
1,Disappointed,My son was very disappointed when it wouldn't play. ???wrong region??? Would love to return it since I had to order another one!!
5,All about Buzz,"If your child loves Buzz Light Year, then this is the tape for you. This movie lived up to my expectations and more."
2,were they too lazy to do this one with computers?,"buzz is the same cocky,thunder stealing jerk from toy story.buzz must defeat zurg,the evil emporer in this one.this is up in space and nobody from toy story except those 2 and the green aliens from pizzaplanet are in it.the kids will watch it but will probably prefer toy story and toy story 2.those too are so far superior even the kids recognize it.theres really not much to say except i hope they dont make anymore."
4,Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins.,"Discover ""The Story Behind The Ultimate Space Hero"" As he stars in his very own movie!(where is Woody and the Round Up Gang's Movie?) Woody made it big as the star of his very own TV show and you can bet Buzz Lightyear had an even bigger beginning! In an unforgettable action-packed saga, Buzz takes on the Evil Emperor Zurg(his father) in intergalactic combat. Together with those hilarious Little Green Men and a whole new cast of exciting characters, Buzz Lightyear takes adventure and heroism: ""To infinity and beyond!&quot"
1,Will not play on standard DVD players in U.S.,"Quite a disappointment to find that this disc will not play. I guess if we lived in the U.K. we could actually watch it. Don't buy it if you are in the United States since, in all likelihood, you will just end up with a piece of useless trash."
1,Didn't Work,This DVD does not work in the US. They should be more clear about that instead of putting (Region 2) I don't know what that means and I'm sure not may other people do either. And now I can't return it because it was opened and they tried to use it. Not fair..:-(
2,"kids might like the action,though it is pretty tame","i wasn't too impressed with this animated spin off of the Toy Storyfilms.i just expected better.the story was pretty weak,but at leastthere were a few amusing moments.i found it too preachy myself.i likethe message it has,about friendship and teamwork,but i just thought itwas a bit too unsubtle.kids might like it,considering there was a fairamount of action.there's nothing inappropriate that i saw,so it'sprobably suitable for most ages.in fact,the movie is pretty tame,withpretty much no violence.anyway,this isn't horrible by any means,it justisn't anything special.for me,Buzz Lightyear of Star Command:TheAdventure Begins is a 2/5"
1,Won't play...,"I'm not certain what the problem is, but this DVD will not play on any standard or Blue Ray DVD player. It only works on a computer. Why would that be? It's frustrating because we also purchased an extra DVD player for our cabin so the little ones could enjoy one of their all-time favorite movies."
4,Bad Reviewers miss the point,"This is supposed to be the cartoon that the Action Figure in the movie is derived from. These complaints about ""No Computer Animation"" and no ""Depth"" is missing the point of the show. It is a fun show for kids and adults. I am a huge fan of Pixar and the Toy Story series, even more so, of Buzz Lightyear himself. I Love this movie and I Love the animated series (with great voice acting, including the always hilarious Patrick Warburton). Highly recommended from this Amazonian."
3,"Funny, good laughs, poor quality.","Basically its a cartoon. NOT a Toy Story. Plain cartoon animation and disappointing effects. But the story is funny and the jokes are great at times, especially the subtle ones that click in your head a few minutes later. Much of the humor flew over the heads of my 1 and 3 year olds, but the adults in the room were smiling. The extra features were extremely lame on the DVD, don't even bother to play them. My 3 yr old son will probably make me watch it with him too many times, but he liked it and I'll suffer through."
1,Awful--makes Saturday cartoons look like masterpieces!,"If you liked Toy Story or Toy Story 2, don't buy this tape, it stinks! I'm really upset to be out the price of the video, as I would mostly like to trash the thing and feel awkward about passing it on as anything more than bio-degradeable garbage. No story line, no characters, makes the use of multi-dimensional Disney characters for selling toys, books and clothing look praiseworthy by comparison! I couldn't wait to get it out of the video player and hide it so that it can never be found again. If this is the best Disney can do with direct to video animation, I'm giving up on Disney too. ENOUGH already with the cheap crap--I'm going to have to start reading cartoon reviews to protect my family from wasting our all too precious and minimal time together--there's no reason to pay good money to rent or buy stuff like this. Even the commercials on TV that interrupt the Saturday cartoons are more interesting than this junk!"
1,Very disappointing,"First, be alerted this is nowhere near the quality of animation or storytelling you would expect after seeing Toy Story 1 and 2. The animation & story are very poor. We (my husband, me & 5 year old) were so disappointed with this video we didn't even finish watching it. I expect more from Disney, even if this was a direct-to-video; I think most people do. Don't waste your time with this one--it seems to be little more than a ""commercial"" for the future Buzz Lightyear cartoon series which I read will be on TV this fall season. I give it one star only because I couldn't get the rating field (above) to accept zero!"
1,TooViolent,"I was very surprised when I first put this video on, after enjoying the Toy Story movies to find that it is nothing but shooting lasers and blowing people up. For parents who don't want their children exposed to violence on televison, this movie is definately one to skip. My three year old watched it one time - After I saw the content, we gave it away. I was very disappointed with Disney for not offering entertainment for children with better values than it's heroic to shoot, kill and blow people up."
1,A must miss. Quick bucks for Disney with little effort.,"This DVD is a excellent example of a big company's desire to make some quick and easy money. This DVD contains flat animation and a flat story. Could have easily been shown as a Saturday morning cartoon but should have been left on the cutting room floor. If you are a Toy Story Fan you will be disappointed. With the exception of the first few minutes this is not computer animated. My kids did enjoy it but have not returned to view it since we saw it the first day we opened it. With Toy Story, Toy Story II and other great animated titles, why would they?"
1,Huge disappointment.,"I didn't hesitate to purchase this DVD for my 3-year-old daughter. I enjoyed the color and quality of the film for the first two minutes then was really turned off by the lack of depth this film has in detail, background, music, pacing, character...anything one normally associates with a Disney film. This movie reminded me of crappy Saturday morning blow-em-up cartoons, although the Saturday morning toons are better than Buzz Lightyear."
3,Pretty much a cartoon.,"I recommend this over a direct to video sequel any day. It's alright for a cartoon short. Pretty imaginative if not original. Much more inspiring than the ""Little Mermaid 2 Return to the Sea"" or ""Return of Jafar""! It should have been marketed as an introductory special of the TV series rather than a movie!"
3,Entertaining but....,"This is basically a movie for Buzz fans. It tells the story about Buzz, not as a toy, but as a futuristic spaceman. He has to face the evil Zurg to save the universe. Don't get me wrong I love Toy Story but I think this is for the younger audiences. I was always more of a Woody fan and find his story lines much more entertaining. Now as far as the animation goes I much prefer the computer graphics but I realize that that movie quality would be much more time consuming and expensive.In conclusion it was funny at times but really not a movie I would buy, I reccomend you rent it but only to die hard Toy Story fans like myself. If you haven't scene the movies it won't be as good.Oh yeah the LGMs are cute!"
3,A Follow up That does not live up to the original,"Though it is a Toy Story spin-off (which earns a few points ni my book) this movies does not live up to the originals. For one fact it is not computer animated , one of the big perks of the original, and second the cute personalities that were in the originals. It's ok but I like the originals much much better"
1,Disney sees $$$ with VIOLENCE?,"This movie had way too much violence. I am glad that I only rented this and that I wasn't lulled by the Disney name to buy it! My four-year-old thought it was scary and my six-year-old asked me to fast-forward through the violent parts.If you liked Toy Story 2, don't bother with this one!"
1,Buyer Beware,"This movie was a disappointment from the moment my children and I started watching it. Except for the name of the character, it has no resemblance to the Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story. The graphics are regular cartoon style graphics, not the style of Toy Story. Save your money."
1,Disappointing,"If you expect this to be in any way related to the fabulous Toy Story movies, don't buy this. There is little plot, a lot of violence and NONE of the charm or wit of the originals. Don't waste your money or your time."
5,Great Recording;hi quality; Perfect for Jazz newbies,"I'm a rock guitarist and I like rock /pop/metal mostly. However, there are exceptions and this is one of them!!! It's jazz but it wont put you to sleep and is great for jazz newbies. Great sound quality; classic combo's;sounds great on my studio monitors!! ""That's The Deal"" is my favorite track.Anyway~~highly recommended"
2,No quality control,"I must echo the sentiment of the other reviewer who mentioned that she has gotten much more wear out of much cheaper brands. This is my second pair of Spanx - the first time I bought full pantyhose and they ran in the toe within 3 hours of my first wear, so I decided to try the footless and I got a run in the leg just putting them on for the first time! I am better off with cheaper control top hose and/or cheaper hose with separate control top panties. I really think that Spanx has become too popular and quality has gone out the window for the sake of mass production."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I heard about your product on OPRAH and was impressed so I ordered 2 pair even though they are pretty pricey. I thought they would be worth it if they were the quality I expected. Well, I loved the way they felt when I put them on and also how my clothes looked....but I had only been at work 2 hours when I was showing them to a friend and noticed a RUN right down the front!!!!!! I was so disappointed to find that they aren't made any better than regular panty hose even though they cost more....they would really be a great product if they were made of stronger fiber to resist runs! Needless to say, I waisted my money.Linda McCollumMadison, Ms."
2,Spanx Footless Pantyhose Review,"After placing this order, I waited several weeks for its arrival to no avail. I received an email telling me that the product would arrive late in an untimely manner. While awaiting arrival, I found the same product at half of the price I paid this company in a local store."
4,Vonnegut film,"I bought this because I like Vonnegut. This certainly lived up to my expectations. It was somewhat confusing at first -- the events in the film did not occur chronologically (but that is part of its power) but it was thought provoking and nicely contrasted ""conventional"" American culture with European and army culture."
4,our mind,"I think this movie depicts how our minds go back and forth to our memories. As you can see Billy Pligrima unstuck on time and he lives now but at the same time he lives with past, present, and perhaps the future as well. It well written and made out as a movie. It is a post modern approach to the viewers of up coming generation. It is a great movie but you might read the book first and watch the film."
3,A Technically Accurate Translation That Misses the Invariable Quirks of the Novel,"An extremely loyal interpretation of the classic Vonnegut novel that skirts the issue of explaining its complicated premise by way of a quick typewriter scene. Seeing it on-screen somehow makes everything seem less surreal than it was in print, even when the scene randomly shifts from a Nazi POW camp to a sharp, sparsely-decorated single room apartment on the surface of an alien world. Really just a handful of loosely-related tales from the protagonist's life, it's four distinct scenes tied together by jarring moments of deja vu and a strange, out-of-step sense of humor. A curious adventure, if only due to the sheer absurdity of its most profound scenes, it fails to stand out in any other meaningful ways. It's more straightforward and matter of fact than the book, and lacks many of the wry grins and quirks that made the original work stand apart. What works in print doesn't always translate so literally to the screen."
4,Pootie Tweet,"History, humor, and humanity combine in a story without a timeline.No timeline exists if you can re-visit any point in your life when youchoose to do so. ""Hello!, Goodbye!"""
4,Cry Laugh and Gasp.,"One of the only movies I've seen that is better or rivals the book. Once again K. Vonneguts character description of the lead (Billy Pigrim) can be related to by less than 40% of us. But those that do will have a life long friend and confidante within Billy. This movie will have you rolling in the isles with laughter, sheading a pathetic tear for ""I can relate"" and gasping at the untold ""fortune"" and ""misfortune"" of the evolving characters. A must see for those that love life."
3,Misses A Point of the Novel,"In my opinion, one of the most heart-breaking aspects of the novel upon which this film was based was the possibility that Billy Pilgrim had to fantasize the Trafalmadorians to hide from the fact the people are RESPONSIBLE for their own actions. I thought the film presented the Trafalmadorians as real, without looking into the possibility that people might be responsible for the horrors they create. I think the best film adaptation of a Vonnegut novel is ""MOTHER NIGHT."""
3,The book is much better,"I bought this movie because I had read the book by Vonnegut and it dissapointed me. Although the escence of the book is there, there is no point of comparison. I gave it three stars because the acting is good (Sacks is esp.funny), but it's not a movie I want to watch more than two times."
2,Well Made But....,"One person gave this film 5 stars because he said it was so faithful to the book. Another gave it 1 star because he said the film left the book ""short changed."" I gave it 2 stars because though the movie was well-made & well-acted it is socially insignificant & philosophically bereft of meaning. Kurt Vonnegut apparently feels that life is nothing more than a series of random moments strung together. He could not be more wrong, as I'm sure he's aware of now in his afterlife.The Bible has the correct answers about life."
1,Terrible adaptation,"Vonnegut is quite hard to translate to film, but it doesn't seem like the producers of this movie even tried. The production resembles something a talented middle school theater group could pull off. Some of the most important scenes in the book are either breezed over or completely left out of the film, basically removing the very aspects that have made this book endure. I was hoping to see a film that lived up to the book for once, and was greatly disappointed."
1,No. No. No.,"One of Kurt Vonnegut's rules for writing was to use the reader's time in a way that they won't feel it wasted. Slaughterhouse-5, the book, does this wonderfully. Slaughterhouse-5, the movie, does not. This is one of the worst book to movie adaptations I've seen in a long time and does not do the book justice at all. An overall boring movie with subpar acting, your time would be better spent reading the book which is a masterpiece."
3,[Three-and-a-half stars out of Four] Kinda mixed up as both Dresden atrocity bombing story and Sci-Fi,"George Roy Hill, Director is betterknown for his Westerns like Judge RoyBean (also; '72 w. Paul Newman) andthe Carradine, Guest, Quaid Bros. in'80's 'The Long Riders'. But it staystrue to fourth-generation german-Amer-I-Can, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.'s book, whichwas mixed as Dresden and Sci-Fi, to av-oid anti-german sensors. Based in parton british historian Dave Irving's greatDresden book. Irving even gets mentionin here!"
5,"Classis movie, classic story",One of my favorites since my teens. a forty year love-affair with a great movie!
2,Very obscure in it's text,"Even more vague than ""Wesley's Notes"" it was near impossible to extract a clear and straight to the point thought on most anything found in scripture"
3,Theme and (Too Many) Variations,"I read this book all the way through. In that sense it is a success.I enjoyed much of it but became exasperated with much of it as time went on.Fiction writers today seem to think that overworking a theme is art. (Everyone you meet echoes everyone you just met; the same plotline is repeated over and over and over.) A little of this is charming. A lot of it is tedious. Same thing with the characters. Too many of them are over the top. It's life in Alice's rabbit hole. After awhile, I just didn't care.So, although the book is clever and quaint and perhaps even artistic, I cannot recommend it."
2,Blatherton,"This was a book that discussed art, and tried too hard to be a work of art itself. Most of the characters were flat and unlikable. The author takes us into three time periods, one melodramatic (the life of Chatterton), one boring (the life of Wallace), and one surreal (the life of Wychwood).On the positive, I did learn more about Chatterton, and had more of a feel for what it would have been like to feel the way Romantics felt. But all in all, I couldn't wait for this book to be over."
3,"CD was just what I wanted, mostly for one song on the track.","Always a good experience to shop at Amazon, appreciate the quality, and assurance that item will be acceptable. Thanks, Donna"
4,Windows into the Christian mystics,Offers helpful and interesting excerpts into the writings of the gurus of Christian mysticism from its very beginnings to the present. Appreciate the summary of the life of each of the mystics which sets the context for introducing us to their selected individual works.
2,Scenic Workout,Sound no their could not hear it with sound on high both Vid. and computer.The rest was ok. will try a different one bur their isno sample to try
2,sceneic worlkout Yosemite valley,"I thought I would get a DVD to use in my TV, but I seen only to play it on the computer. Not what I expected. And don't know how to transfer it to a DVD player."
4,Craniosacral work,"The bible if you want to learn the craniosacral visionary work. Lots of ditail, very complicate but also good tips."
1,nothing new,"I tried really hard to like this book, but I found it just a poor rehash of information already put forward by William Sutherland D.O, the father of Cranial Osteopathy and John E. Upledger, D.O., O.M.M., the developer of CranioSacral Therapy. For a true Visionary approach to ""CranioSacral"" work, you should consult the works of Sutherland and Upledger."
1,been there already,"milne's work is good. if i didn't know of upledger's CST i'd love it.instead, i'd recommend the source: upledger's craniosacral therapy.that's where it's at."
1,Sunset policy bad one for Quicken,"Like others we have received notice that Quicken 2003 online function will be ""Sunset"" in April. Poor policy again by Quicken. What this means is if you purchase this product you have purchased key functions for only 3 years (currently but Quicken is allowed to arbitrarily lower this if they need to raise more cash). Frankly the improvements in their new function set do not warrant the additional cost. This is a money grab, plain, pure, and simple. Competitiors, do you hear? Opportunity knocks!"
1,You will hate yourself if you buy this,"The only thing I can think about Intuit and their release of Quicken 2006 is that they hate their customers and care only about greed and themselves. After years of using quicken, I have to throw quicken out because only a handful of banks use their new OFX format (for which banks must pay $1000's in fees) and you cannot use QIF for any savings or checking account, meaning that they disabled this feature forcing millions of customers to either manually enter transactions for their banks or just throwing out Quicken 2006 which is what I am doing. This program demonstates everything that is wrong with a company that dominates a software sector. I hope they go bankrupt very soon. I will never buy from them again."
1,Decline of Quicken,"Ditto to this review:""I have been a Quicken user since it was a DOS application back in the mid `80s. It has always been a very good and reliable product. However: Quicken 2006 is by far the worst release of Quicken Intuit has ever produced. ""Today it cannot even print a simple report, while all other software on my system is functioning with out problems.This just proves software should not be purchased on past history alone..."
2,Extremely disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed with Quicken Basic 2006 because it does not support true OFX imports unless the bank is a Quicken participating bank. My bank offers OFX downloads of my financial information but has no plans to partner with Quicken. Intuit's only suggestion of recourse to me it to ""wait"" until they do! Customer convenience is obviously not high on their agenda."
2,Quicken Basic 2006,"The product is ok. It is very similar to MS Money. It does not have a clean, or appealing interface like Money does. When I connected to my bank to update my accounts it required me to change my password. Then didn't allow me in my account with the new password. I then could not even access my account through a web browser. I found several other reviewers that had the same or similar issues. If you want to be able to update your accounts via web, I would buy MS Money 2006. I purchased Money 2006 and haven't had a single issue."
3,Forced to buy Quicken 06,"I am not at all happy with the abrupt move by Intuit to sunset older versions of Quicken. I purchased Quicken basic, while muttering under my breath, declining the ""deal"" on the deluxe version. It works, it does its job. Register fades out reconciled entries, making it difficult to track back payments, and icons seem to be getting smaller and harder to see. Adequate but not outstanding. Setting up a transaction group very frustrating, Help window next to useless. You have to click an options button while creating a scheduled transaction to set up a new group. Frustrating."
1,QuickenBasic 2006,After i ordered the product from Quicken I found a friend who already had it and after looking at his found it to be way to complex for my needs. 1 star is incorrect as didn't open the psckage.
3,"Like it said, its a kit.",there are absolutely no pre assembeled pieces in it. it works pretty well though you forcefully have to push a ping pong ball through. it wouldnt be able to be automatic. shoots apx 20ft but not with much force. it also vibrates alot so it has potential to move.
3,"Not perfect, but it has value","They have made this as simple as possible, yet still actually be a build-it toy. It could use a couple of wrenches to tighten the bolts. The ball is a little big for the standard space created by the spinning wheels. Just tilt the wheels outwards and it works OK. No real speed or force, but quite safe for anyone over the age of 9."
1,electric cannon,"I attempted to make this kit with a young man age 13, who I mentor. the box was misleading in that it stated all you needed was batteries. In truth, you needed some kind of wire stripper and needle nose pliers would have been very helpful. We did manage to strip the wires as instructed, using a pair of scissors but we broke one of the connections trying to attach the wire. The manual dexterity to make this is more that the two of us had together."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"This DVD was reviewed on two DVD machines and was shown to be damaged beyond use. While the information presented may be first rate the poor quality of the DVD was inexcusable. My advice to you, should you purchase this DVD, would be to retain the inclosed paperwork as you may be forced to return the disk."
4,It's All True,"As an active duty officer, I found this book to be not only highly entertaining but highly enlightening as well. Dixon could have ground an axe here, but he didn't. His writing is clear, concise, logical, eminently readable, and very accurate in a depiction of what actually goes on in the minds of some officers. While his emphasis is on character development, there is some discussion of unit character as well. A great book for those interested in why we think the way we do, and we can only hope someday, somewhere, someone will publish a second, updated version which includes organizational behavior which reinforces incompetence. His allusions to ""The General"" by C. Forester are quite appropriate. Definitely a book to be read by active duty as well as civilians."
3,Very interesting,Very interesting and it must have application to incompetent leadership outside the military as well. Let down a little by some not entirely convincing arguments.
3,Good story. Not strong enough on the suspense.,"I was impressed by Phil Rickman's writing style and the way he created a sharp sense of time and place for this novel. The plot was good but I think the suspense was weak. I think this novel is more of a mystery rather than a thriller, a real story rather than a fantasy. The characters were interesting enough, but there was an abundance of characters which I found to be a bit confusing. I do not believe the characters were stereotypical; they were realistic with very unique and captivating personalities. Quite frankly, it is the characters who made the story interesting, not the plot. The cover states that it's about exorcism, but no such thing occurs in the story, atleast not of any importance. It is simply about the corruption of the church of England and about strange ideas affecting the younger generation beliefs. It carries a few surprises but will require patience to read."
4,Love these books :),"I love the Merrily Watkins books - the tantalising thrill of supernatural vs. mundane explanations, the complexity of the lead characters, the vivid descriptions of the Herefordshire countryside and a readable but not unsophisticated style. Perfect reading for a cold winter's afternoon!One star is deducted for an occasional lapse in pace; no of course this is not what you might call ""high literature"" (if you were so inclined), but I don't judge it by those standards. Nonetheless as supernatural escapist thriller, this is a top-class offering."
4,Midwinter it may be but a good read,"I am enjoying this series by Phil Rickman, particularly the relationship between mother and daughter, and the way the church is reacting to a woman priest."
2,Yoga for kids,"Strange! Inappropriate innuendos for a childrens video. My children became more interested once the focus turned toward the animals, and away from the hippy wearing nothing but a sheet around his waist."
2,Not Sure How I Came to Own This CD,"I am not really sure how I came across this CD. Maybe it was a random review and the lack of good judgement! But honestly, Doug Powell is a capable musician and average song writer. Unfortunately, with all the music that is floating around out there, average is not good enough. Doug's music is at best derivative and his voice borders on whiny! Even at .83 cents used, you would be throwing away money on the shipping and handling. I would recomend a Freedy Johnston or Chuck Nash CD. Then you would be pleasantly surprised!"
5,After Jesus: The Triumph of Christianity,"This is a no nonsense historical account of the five centuries after the cruxificion of Jesus Christ. If you are Catholic, it will unravel many of the symbolism the Church incorporates into the liturgy or mass. For example, the book has an excellent depiction of the evolution of the wording that went into the Apostle's Creed and how it changed several times into what we hear Catholics profess today. The book offers a perfect chronology of the Christian movement from its beginnings as a Jewish sect to the structuring of one of the most powerful religious institutions of our time. The illustrations and photographs, as well as the easy reading level, make this book enjoyable from beginning to end. It is the perfect primer on the history of Christianity before the Protestant Reformation and the beginnings of Islam. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in historical theology."
5,Play Mozart at a Party,"The aristocratic societies of Salzburg and Vienna loved to have parties during the time of Mozart. Wealthy patrons commissioned Wolfgang Amadeus to compose light and dance-like music for such events. These are called Divertimentos or Divertimenti in plural form. These are beautiful pieces that are waltz in style. At this time, being the 1700's, the waltz had not yet been introduced. However, the German Landler and other such Contradances popular at the time. The music is'nt as expressive as Mozar'ts symphonies or sonatas. After all these are only serenades.. only music for an evening party. So if you like the Mozart style with its delightful and rich melodies, and want to hold parties, this cd is a wonderful buy."
5,"Sweet, magnificent Mozart","This is Mozart at the relative beginning of his career. These divertimenti were written during Mozart's Mannheim years, and reveal and adolescent composer already maturing into the master of later years. This is sweet, glorious music that is at once touching and uplifting. Buy this CD."
5,Very tasty,"I'd gotten a pack of these from a Mom's food store and we all enjoyed them...even my hubby who is addicted to another widely know brand of sandwich cookie said Country Choice was superior. Price is about the same so I ordered a case from Amazon. Of course, now I have to find a good hiding place and dole them out as needed.Thanks for selling cases!"
4,I like em on the cheap,"How about $1.50/12oz. pack at a special discount store in Ft. Worth? Yes, they have gone out of date, but do I care? They are good, but I have to pace myself and not lose control. So far, the only ones they have had are the vanilla. I long for the old Keebler Vanilla Cremes that, like so many other Keebler cookies, are not made anymore. These are really good."
5,Awesome,Closest to regular Oreos among the organic ones....we cannot eat regular ones any more...we have grown to love these.
5,Geat product but OVER-PRICED,"Great product!!!!! Some of the best cookies on the market.Shame local grocery stores do not carry these, at least not in NC. Buy these from Amazon only and get free shipping. Buy from any other seller here(Nutricity) and it will cost you double what Amazon sells them for ."
5,Hard to Resist!,"The Duplex cookies are delicious! It is difficult to keep a package in the cabinet for long periods of time because everyone needs ""just one more."" Excellent organic cookie that I will be purchasing regularly."
3,Recipe Still The Same- Scrumptious,Just bought these again at Kroger- Unbelievably tasty- beats Oreo but is more expensive and actually worth it- plus no high fructose sugar.
3,A little disappointed in Amazon Grocery...,"I ordered the ginger lemon cremes, but was very disappointed to find Amazon screwing up so badly. The outside of the box as shipped from the vendor to Amazon clearly says ""VANILLA"" in very large letters, but Amazon slapped a sticker with a barcode on it that tags the box of cookies as ""ginger lemon cremes,"" so now instead of enjoying the ginger lemon cremes I had been looking forward to tasting, I have to go through the hassle of trying to return these and hopefully get Amazon to send me the right product a second time around. So, now I have to wait to see if I actually get ginger lemon cremes in another few weeks or however long Amazon takes. Boy, their service has gotten worse and worse every year since I started buying stuff from Amazon back in their early days."
5,Better than Girl-Scout Cookies!,"I never thought I'd find something comparable to those choc-mint Girl Scout cookies (sorry Girls), but these are some of the yummiest cookies I've ever had - certainly the best packaged I've ever had. If you like choc-mint, don't pass on these. AND ORGANIC TOO!"
5,Super great - way better than Oreos,"These chocolate cookies are an organic version of Oreo-type cookies but are far superior than that name brand, in my opinion. They are seriously addicting and I cannot buy them anymore because I tend to eat toooooooo many and the package is gone in a couple/few days. They are not particularly healthy - they are a cookie, after all! The cookie part is nice and crunchy (almost tending toward light and crisp) with an excellent chocolate flavor. The filling is great - smooth and creamy (does not get hard like some other oreo-types) with a good degree of sweetness. I have also tried the Paul Newman brand of oreos and was not that impressed. The Country Choice far exceeds all other brands - highly recommend!"
1,how in the world could anyone give this five stars?????,"I love Lloyd and Troma, so I decided to check this movie out since it was the first out of the ""make your own damn movie"" series. This movie was beyond horrible. All this movie consist of is people smoking pot and zombies.I think the only funny part with bad special effects and a cop car. It is beyond me that someone would think this is worth 5 stars then again I guess the director has family and friends."
4,"That's ""K"" as in ""knife"".","This CD is a reissue of an old double LP collecting the ""best"" tracks from Mike Nichols and Elaine May's three comedy albums. Most of it is very funny. My personal favorite is ""Telephone"", an extended routine about one man's quest to complete a phone call. This is a great sampler of material from a great comedy team."
2,A trendsetting period piece,"What these 2 artists bring to the table are heaping helpings of warmth, humanity, charm, even sweetness -- not to mention wit and originality. Their trademark parodies of everyday situations, when they work, are nothing short of uproarious. ""Mother and Son"" and ""Merry Christmas, Doctor"" are priceless, timeless routines that play so well 40 years later as to show the brilliant vision underlying this artistic duo's act and ability to push the envelope in their time. The question in buying this CD is whether the strength of those cuts, plus the generous quantity of cuts, can compensate for the faded vitality of the others imposed by the passing of time."
4,In Retrospect ~ Mike Nichols & Elaine May,Wonderful trip down Memory Lane ... and a reminder of the tremendous influence these two great writers/performers have had on comedy.
4,Keith at Ashley River El.,I think The Frog Alphabet Book is very interesting. It has a lot of info. but Ralph did a great job illustrating. He is a wonderful illustrater.
5,Maurice at Ashley River El. School,"The Frog Alphabet Book, was a good book because it's educational and has good illustrations. I also liked the book because I learned about amphibians I've never heard of before and the ullustrations were unique. My favorite illustration in the book was the picture of the Red-eyed tree frog. I like this picture because it's colorfull and I think Ralph Masiello did a good job."
3,Michelle at Ashley River El.,The books Ralph Masiello illustrated are fantastic! I read The Frog Alphabet Book. The book is swimming with frogs. It was really realistic looking. I loved it.
3,Secret Soldier : The Story of Deborah Sampson,Ann McGovern has written an easily read biography for beginning readers of a woman who made historical history at the time of the Revolutionary War. Deborah disguised herself as a male soldier in the War so that she could seek adventure. She learned the hardships of the War first hand and kept her identity hidden until she was wounded. The illustrations in the story are a delightful addition which allows a young reader to stay interested in the text. I believe my son who is a reluctant reader will enjoy this book and learn about an interesting role that one women played in our countries history.
5,Wonderful book!,I read this as a child in the early 80s. The local librarian recommended it to me and I absolutely loved it! I still remember it after all these years and I highly recommend it!
4,Educational and Interesting Book,"It is about a girl who has to leave her mom because she can't take care of her. So she goes and lives with a family. The guardians said she could not go to school because school was only for boys. So she taught her self from the boys textbooks. When she got older where she could leave their house she became a schoolteacher. In the mean while she was working on her outfit for becoming a soldier in the army. I believe this is a good book for girls. I think that it tells girls that they are as equal as the boys and they can do anything that they set their mind to. She has some conflict in this book. The first conflict was that she could not go to school, because school was for boys. The second conflict was that she wanted to be in the army so she dressed up as a man in order to be in the army."
3,The Secret Soldier,"I think that The Secret Soldier was a decent book. However, I think that the book was too short and vague. It did not explain how Debrah made the clothes for war or prepare for the war. It also did not go into detail about what she did at Mrs. Thacher's. If I wrote the book, I would go into detail to help the reader ""paint"" the picture of the scene in their mind. I know that I learned a lot from reading this book. For example, I knew that war was hard, but I think that this helped me understand the hardships of war a lot more. In addition to this, The Secret Soldier went along with what we are reading very nicely (we are learning about the Revolution) As you can see, I do like the Secret Soldier, but I think that it is a book for a younger child."
1,Not that good,it was very vague and didn't give you a lot of information. It is a good book for a 3rd grader.
3,A Girl At War,1 Secret Soldier is an OK book. But it wasn't that interesting.It's about a girl that has to live with alot of different people. Then when she lives with this one family they're very friendly and they treat her nice. When she grows up she wants to fight in the war. And she has to act like a man. 2 I felt sorry for the girl because she had to act like a man and talk like a man and not let them find out that she's a girl. 3 My favorite part was when they found out that she was a girl when she went to the hospital. 4 I rated this book 3 stars because it didn't really explain the story very well.
3,"Review of ""The Secret Soldier""","This book was a book that was a very quick read for me. I in turn thought it was very interesting.The fact that Deborah Sampson dresses up as a male, and uses an alias of ""Robert Shurtliff"". She thought that this was the only way to be able to explore the Colonies."
5,The Secret Soldier,"The Secret Soldier is a marvellous biography about a valiant woman named Deborah Sampson. She was undoubtedly one of the most courageous and adventurous woman in America. This book is a fabulous story of a youthful woman who was born impoverished, and was ent from house to house until she came of ge to be on her own. Determined to discover adventure, she disguises herself as a soldier and fights in the Revolutionary War. She wanted adventure and she certainly got it.I highly recommend this book to any variety of children. It is a quick read but at the same time it's very intriguing. I relished this book because it is a true story about a real girl who really lived. It captures your attention and doesn't let it go until the very end!"
4,The Secret Soldier,This is a very exciting story that just happens to be true. It is about a girl who' s mother is not able to take care of her children and has to give them a way. Later on in life Deborah becomes a school teacher to help children. She then finds herself wanting help more. She enlists in the war and fights and does well. She ends up getting wounded and finds herself getting examined by someone who thinks she is a man. You'll have to read to find out the rest.
2,"Not One Of My Favorite Books ""N.O.O.M.F.B.""","If you have read the title of my review, you should realize that this is not one of my favorite books. Although short and mildly interesting and nearly gripping at the end, it is mostly boring for a person who already has good Revolutionary War knowledge. It also lacks many redeeming qualities. For example... the pictures are of low quality and are not historically accurate. In fact, the picture on page 42 just screams out, ""Deborah was with the British and was shot by the Continentals.""-- not the opposite. The problem is that the illustrator mixed up the hats of both sides. But most importantly ... WHY IS RED THE ONLY COLOR?! There are some good facts in this book and I recommend it for younger readers, but not for people who want advanced Revolutionary War facts and tactics."
5,The Mystery,1 The Locker is about a girl named Marlee who moves to this new school and her belonged to this missing girl named Sullen Downing. When she first opens the locker this horrible smell comes out and she faints. Then alot of other things happen to her over the next few days. She connects with the missing girl and sees what she saw. 2 I felt sorry for what happened to Sullen because she was a new girl too. 3 My favorite part was when Tyler and Marlee were in the tree together and they were talking about what happened. 4 I rated this book 5 stars because It just kept getting better and better. And I couldn't put it down.
2,This book stunk,This is about a young girl who decides to join the revolutionary war.This book Was horrid the only thing that saved it wae it's mediocre pictures.This reflected me in no way.The main story element is internal conflict because she's tryng to keep her self together.I recommend this book to who ever has nothing better to do.
2,Not the same as what I've had in the past,The bottle that arrived was a different color than the one shown online. The one shown online was the one I ran out of. What was shipped to me smelled different. They were good about the return though.
5,exciting book,"I just walked the labyrinth for the first time last weekend. I wanted to know more and my friend gave me this book. It answered all my questions plus much more. I want to go back and walk it a lot with all the suggestions from this book. Reading this book gave me the confidence to explore the labyrinth a lot more. Read it, read it, read it!"
2,SyFy Original Movie...says it all,"The budget couldn't have been THAT bad. But the brutal CGI and bad acting sure didn't help the semi-cruddy writing & plot.Given that this seems to be a SyFy original movie its not as bad as some of the other crap I've seen by them. But had I known it was theirs I honestly wouldn't have bothered renting it. Their movies are a joke. But, if you like their stuff, have at it. I've seen a LOT worse in general, thus the reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1.More in depth review (with spoilers) on Shivers of Horror"
1,Unwatchable,"I've seen some bad movies and this ranks right up there with the worst of them. This has bad acting and a disjointed, amaturisticly written storyline....a pretty bad combination."
1,Kiosk Rating <1,"I agree with the other one star. There's a reason you suddenly find movies you've barely or hardly heard of showing up in Redbox - because most everyone found out, with information gleaned from independent sources, that nobody wanted to watch the movies in the first place. Redbox probably has to pay about thirty five cents for rental rights which is about the value of this movie and of course the rest is operating cost and profit.Anyway, pointless goes nowhere plot of the usual group reunion brings to life the cheap CGI, that any high school graphics class could create in a week, Ghostface face (from Scream) coming through mirrors to kill in the usual, cheap keep the production cost low, cartoonish way. You don't really see the kill just some smeared paint later. Anyway, Mothman CGI gets toasted at the end like burning CGI tissue paper - about 5 seconds. Lots of FF will end the boredom."
2,We've seen this many times before,"I remember seeing this when it was called I Know what you did last summer, or something similar. It is an old and tired formula. College pals accidentally kill a younger brother and do not want to go to jail, so they make it look like he hit his head and drowned. Much later, they return to their hometown and start being attacked by a creature celebrated there and called Mothman. Yawn. You can guess the rest."
2,It's broken,"I left it in my coat pocket. The ON button got pushed. The lens tried to extend. Now, it doesn't open at all anymore. Nice camera while it worked, though.I also kind of thought the ""touch"" interface with the buttons along the edge was goofy."
2,Samsung NV 10,"This is a beautiful highly styled camera, but, the lens is terrible, and also very inconsistent, sometimes not bad.The manual is a waste of paper, telling you nothing.The controls are awkward and not conventional, sometimes not working well at all.Samsung should have done their homework better, this camera is a dog and not worth the money, had Samsung gone a bit farther this could have been a winner, as is, it is a loser."
1,refurbished bit o junk,"Not really fair to judge on a refurbished camera that didn't work at all, but it felt nice in my hand, and the sellers (whose name escapes me) were nothing short of stellar.Since the camera didn't work I didn't have a chance to work through the learning curve on the non standard user interface...Probly won't be getting a samsung anytime soon"
4,Great Camera,I bought this camera for my teen before our vacation to Australia. It is very slim for the MP and other features and a very good looking camera. My teen loves it and took some great pictures and continues taking them. It's performance in low light is not great at all but for the most part the flash helps. The video feature is good and a lot of fun to play around with. Overall a good buy.
2,Don't buy this,"I felt impressed with the camera when I first saw it, but after few months, the pictures showed horizontal white lines, according to a tech this was related to a sensor, if you want to waste $200 buy it this piece of junk, I won't buy another Samsung camera, terrible experience"
1,Terrible Delivery system for FREE with Super Saver Shipping,"I'm still waiting now(3/20)Order 3/12, Shipped : 3/17,Delivery estimate: March 26, 2007 - March 30, 2007I can't believe the shipping system."
4,Above averager camera that looks great!,"This camera is gonna get picked on for having it's flaws etc. But in the end it's a nice little camera that takes really good pictures, great video, and has a pretty simple interface (thought it requires getting used to).dpreview recommends this camera. I agree that when you weigh performance issues against high styling and the low price of this camera - it comes out a winner."
2,More Popeye than Betty Boop,"Despite its title and description, this DVD contains only one Betty Boop cartoon, ""Betty Boop and the Little King"" (1936) (in black and white), and over a dozen other (mostly Popeye) cartoons, in both color and black and white. It does not contain cartoons entitled, ""Is My Palm Read"", ""Betty Boop in Swat the Fly"", or ""Betty Boop and Little Jimmy"" as indicated on the back of the packaging. However, because I purchased it from a Walgreens store in June 2004 priced at $1.99 each or 2 for $3.00 (along with some other deceptively labeled cheapies), I cannot consider the DVD to be a total disappointment. Recommended more for fans of Popeye."
5,Beautiful Book,"This book doesn't just teach babies how to swim, it teaches an attitude towards them..I'm learning how to teach patiently and learn that there's no dead line. We *are* having fun at the same time. I live in a country where making babies swim sounds strange and this book's helping alot, I don't need to council anyone. I bought another resource when I got this book (a VHS) and it wasn't good at all, it was kind of teaching by force. I stopped using it and I only follow this great book (great photoes too!). Thanks to the author!"
3,Photos outstanding; writing is sometimes a little hard to follow,"This book is so-so, only because it doesn't explain in detail how to actually do everything. It may say ""do this"" or ""do that"" but it doesn't explain exactly the best way to go about doing some of the things.The authors try really hard to explain what needs to be done, but it must be difficult to write how to exactly teach an infant to swim without showing moving photos, as in a video. It might also be because it's written by someone in England and I'm in the U.S. It's all English, but it's not 100% the English I'm used to.The photos are outstanding, and I did get my 6 mo. old daughter to float the first time I tried what was suggested. I really like how the author stresses that the experiences and the joy is what it's all about, as opposed to having to build new skills each time you take your baby into the water."
4,Great camera for most situations,"Great compact digital camera. I've owned this for a few years now and I've taken *thousands* of pictures with it. It's also very robust. I've dropped it numerous times onto hard surfaces and it continues to take great point-and-shoot photos. I've owned about half a dozen point-and-shoot digital cameras and this one takes the best pictures. My biggest complaint is that the camera takes a while to reset between taking pictures (might have something to do with the media card) and it's not a great low-light camera (works fine close range with flash of course, but sometimes a little overexposed). I also like the way it recharges (plug camera right into charger without taking battery out) and the VERY long battery life. For trickier shots (low light without flash, etc) I have a much ""fancier"" (and much more expensive) DSLR camera. However, this camera works great for 95% of ""normal"" situations, and is compact and robust for carrying around and traveling."
4,"A little homely looking, but a great camera!","I just ordered this camera, and so far its perfect for me. I'm not an avid photographer, I just wanted a cheaper, decent camera that was small enough to keep in my purse. I really like how it comes with a recharable battery instead of needing double A's all the time like cameras I've owned in the past.To me, the look of the camera is a little goofy and unfortunately, the booklet it came with is not helpful at all, but other than that, its great!"
5,Digital Camera Kodak Easyshare V1003,"I purchased the camera 2 days before the wedding of my Grandson. The camera was easy to use, the pictures I took came out well. The instructions that came with the camera were easy to follow. The camera is small and light enough to carry with you. I highly recommend this camera."
4,Nice,"This is a nice fairly simple camara. I bought it for my sister for christmas. I liked it because of the color, size and features. Thought it was a good price for the features."
4,Kokak Easy Share,"My daughter purchased it. It doesn't seem as clear as my 8-pixel for some reason, and it is a 10-pixel, most noticeable inside. Not sure what the problem is. Arrived quickly and seemed to be fine at first."
4,Camera,It was a great purchase. For the money I think it's the best value available. I have always been pleased with Kodak products and this camera is no different.
4,Kodak Digital Approved!!!,I think it's a great camera especially for the price! It has a lot of features and I'm technologically challenged so it's taking me a while to figure out all it all it has to offer but I would definitely recommend it to family and friends!!!
1,Defective out of the box - $80 bill,"I purchased a Kodak V1003 camera prior to taking a short vacation. The camera was defective out of the box (frozen lens cover). Finally able to push the cover open (an unauthorized action), I managed to capture at least a few pictures and informed Kodak. The official response - Kodak repairs but does not replace defective cameras (brand new units included). Unauthorized damage/repairs void the warranty resulting in an $80 repair fee.Buyer beware!"
3,"great still images, poor video quality","i got this camera as a christmas present. my aunt knows how much i love photography and she gave me this camera which was originally hers. it's a pretty good camera. the still images are great. especially in landscape mode. it's very easy to use and i love the built in picture editor. the thing that really disappointed me was the lack of video quality, especially at night. the video quality is terrible. you have to be in a well lit enviroment (and i mean VERY well lit) for this camera to work, including in still images. and for still images at night, like all cameras, it has to be stabilized when you take a picture, otherwise the picture will be blurry. but still, the pictures are great and it's a good camera. but the video quality is just, terrible."
3,"It's ok, but....","I ordered this camera because I had one before, which I ran over with my car....don't ask! I am never able to view the screen well in bright outdoor light.The used camera arrived without a cord to connect to my computer or a charger, but luckily I had my old ones. There were also personal photos still left from previous owner on the camera, which should have been deleted before being sent to me."
5,Great Camera !,"Great camera, takes nice clear photos. Does not have a shutter delay like most. Takes video and does all the little things like black and white and sepia. Overall A great camera. So easy even grandma has used it."
5,One of the best on the market,"I am a total caveman when it comes to things digital. I have had digital cameras before but always felt reluctant to use them as they were too complicated, batteries ran out, the viewing screen was too small, and you had to wait a long time between shots. Well, I am here to tell you to buy this machine. It is great: simple to use; rechargable batteries, large viewing screen; very short wait between shots; AND it connects right up to the Kodak Easy Share printer (or you can remove the SD media and stick that into the printer) and makes exceptional quality photos. For $200 you can't beat this camera."
5,Wonderful camera!,"I've started taking more trips, and my little Sony Cybershot 3.2MP wasn't doing it for me anymore. I picked this camera up on a whim, because it was under $200 and 10MP--the most I'd seen in this price range.What a great camera! First, it's light and small, so I can stick it in my pocket on hikes or vacations. Second, the colors are vibrant and the pictures sharp. And third (my favorite) it has a timer so I can actually be IN the pictures I'm taking!"
3,"Lots of MP for cheaper, you get what you pay for.","I'm torn about this camera.On the one hand, it has really nice picture quality: really brilliant colors with enough light and lots of MPs for the price. Then again pictures tend to run a bit blurry at times and the response time button-to-capture lags a bit.Overall I'm really happy with the pictures. This camera is a nice fit for what I need: I don't take photos often, and when I do I like doing artsy quiet shots. If you're more on-the-go and need higher performance, go with a CANON.AUDIO CLICKING ON VIDEO FEATURE: Videos will have a clicking noise in the audio. It wasn't until I read another Amazon review that I discovered this happens because of the Auto Focus feature. Thankfully it's stopped since I've turned the feature off. Absolutely annoying design flaw."
2,Could Use Some Improvement,"I bought the V1003 last week. I was impressed with the 10 MP, the price, and the printing dock. I have one question however. Will you tell me what the heck it is with Kodak that they feel a viewfinder is no longer needed??? I get a bit queasy trying to focus and compose an image with just the screen in the back. A coupled viewfinder would really make it sweet in my humble opinion. Also, the shutter recycling time is indeed a bit slow, and I don't know why. I am reconsidering my purchase for a SONY or a CANON or NIKON. It's really too bad, though! It could have been much nicer if the camera was properly designed and engineered in the first place."
1,LCD Screen Cracked!,"I had the same problem with the LCD screen. I had the camera just 3 months or so and it cracked. I had it in a pocket in my purse, so it was not without some protection. After reading about all the hassles with Kodak customer service, I really don't want to go thru the trouble of mailing it off, etc.....I had an EasyShare a few years ago that worked just lovely, so that is why I bought this one. But no more Kodak products for me."
4,Fun product,"I have not used this camera much yet, but it's very easy to use and transfer pictures. Lots of great features! I'm not a girly girl, but I love the pink - very cute!!"
4,"A decent camera for the money, but I expected better","The camera is ok, but the pictures tend to be on the dark side. I can not get the camera to connect to my pc. I got to work twice but now it will not at all, maybe it is just a bad USB cable."
1,Broken Lens,"I received this camera as a gift and had to send it in three times to be fixed. (Yes, I am EXTREMELY careful with my cameras) First, the lens would not go back inside. Second, because it would not charge. Third, for the lens again. I used it once after it got sent back and it broke again. A waste of time."
2,Bad LCD,"I recieved this camera as a gift for my birthday in March, and I had to send it back in early May to have the LCD screen repaired, I had not dropped it and the camera hadn't had any impact. It took a couple weeks to get my camera repaired and it worked great. Last night my camera was in the new case I purchased (thinking it would protect it better) which was inside my purse when my purse fell off my sofa. Once again, the LCD Screen is broken. I think it is ridiculous that a camera be so easily ruined. I am not going to pay to have my camera ""fixed"" again, only to have it to break again in a few months. It's a shame because I took some excellent pictures with it, and I really like the panoramic feature. I wouldn't rcommend this camera unless you're going to treat it like an ""Egg Baby"" for a High School health class."
4,"Picky, picky, picky","Don't believe all the ""expert"" reviews that give this camera low marks. These clowns are looking for the perfect camera that does not exist. This camera takes great pictures, is easy to use, has loads of features, is small and compact, and is backed by Kodak. That's good enough for 99% of us."
2,not the best,"This camera has lots of features, but most are not worth it. The picture quality goes down to nothing when you use digital zoom, and videos and often dark and can not be edited. The lense is often getting stuck on the open position, so I will return it for refund and probably go back to a FUJI camera."
4,1st Easy Share,"This is my 1st Easy Share and I love it. I've had so much fun with it. I keep it in my purse at all times, just in case. I've not used to video jet but will soon I'm sure."
2,Not the best Picture Quality,"The camera came on time, but im not happy with the picture quality of this camera. Taking pictures from a distance is a waste of tiem cause the pictures come out horrible, even when i use the various settings."
2,Many Fixes,"When I had bought this camera two years ago, I was thrilled. It produced crystal clear pictures and very, very easy to use. Within a couple of months of my purchase, though, the camera would turn off in the middle of when I was taking a picture, but the lens would still be zoomed out and I couldn't turn it back on for a while. That happened a couple of times. Then, I took it on a cruise and plugged it into the right voltage outlet so that it could charge and when I took it out, it wasn't charged and it wouldn't turn on. I spend about $80 on getting it fixed and I had to get it fixed often. Great pictures, but it wasn't worth how many times I had to get it fixed and how much it cost to get it fixed.Kodak EasyShare V1003 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Slate Gray)"
4,great for electronic uneducated people,"i bought this camera for a birthday gift for my mother who is computer and electronic elliterate, she figured it out with no problems and it is a great little camera."
5,Fabulous!,"The Camera came quickly and very well wrapped in it's original seal. Just FYI- if you get it threw UPS, the box was thrown to my door from my gate 3 feet away! Other than that, the camera is Fabulous!"
3,Product Review,"The camera is compact, fairly light and easy to use, and takes high quality photos. I think the camera is a good value. Negatives: doesn't dock to an older Easy Share version I had; the software takes longer to start than older version; I miss having a viewfinder, this camera just has a view screen; battery cover slips open fairly easily if you hold it with a pincer grip; camera body fairly slippery, could use some coarse grip surfaces. Overall satisfied, but things I would change, and wish I had considered beforehand."
2,Don't bother!!,I bought this camera because I thought 10 megapixels would be better than the Kodak I have with 4 megapixels. It's not! Pictures come out blurry and it take so long for the camera to actually take the picture that your subject has chaged position and the picture looks terrible anyway. I would not have bought this camera if I had a chance to play with it first.It also needs a separate cord to work with the easyshare printer dock 6000 that I already owned. I am going to buy another camera and let my 15 year old have this one. Don't waste your money.
2,Disappointing,"This is the fifth Kodak digital camera I have bought and like two others it has needed a major repair after a minimal impact. The warranty is virtually worthless as the contract repair company simply says the damage was due to an impact and there is no recourse. The prior cameras took nice pictures, however this model never did work correctly. The flash often did not work for indoor shots. The Kodak cameras are simply too fragile and this is the last one I will buy."
4,Teaching Stories from India,The book comprises of 25 short stories from India. These stories are developed in the context of the saints and sadhus of this land of ancient religions. Each story has a clear moral message to the young people for whom these are targeted. The simplicity of the style and the language makes it easy for everyone to follow the events even if one is uninitiated in the cultural and religious complexity of India.
4,Worthwhile,"Although I didn't like this as well as her WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, this book was a worthwhile read. It explores issues like coming of age, art vs. commercialism, what defines success, and how human connection shapes and forms our lives. It's also a wonderful portrait of Astoria, Queens, which is almost another character in the book. Some might say it's also a re-imagining of the Christ story and they would have plenty of evidence to back up that claim (it's all here--disciples, sacrifice, resurrection).In the end, though, for me, this is a touching story about growing up, seen through the lives of some very complex and fascinating characters. The only reason I deducted a star for this effort is that sometimes Shriver was a little too keen on shouting ""look at how brilliantly I can write; look at how elegantly I can turn a phrase"". She hadn't yet learned the virtue and value of simplicity when she wrote this one. If she had, this would be a five-star book. Still, highly recommended."
3,These boots are not meant for walking,"I received these 2 days ago and as I have worn boots for a long time I know there is a break in period, but honstly I would rather walk barefoot on concrete. The sole is so hard that it sends pain up through your feet half way up your calf. I bought a pair of gel inserts today and that has helped some. I gave them 3 stars because they seem to be of decent quality materials and well made even though they are made in China. They are quite comfortable when not walking I guess thats why they call them trucker boots, if you don't have to walk much you should be fine."
5,Durango boot review,"These are excellent boots. I have worn them for years. Also, the seller, PapaShoe, is very nice to work with, and the people there are very friendly and helpful. I would recommend their store to buy shoes from to others."
5,GATOR BA$$,Dis is da Florida Klassik we been waitin' foe!!!Grandaddy Souf is claimin' trill wit dem solid deep souf beatsenriched wit hard as nipple verses. You really gotta get it cause it like a Goodie Mob or a old OutKast album. It make you fell proud to be SOUTHERNPORNALISTIK!!!
2,I can't believe I was in this piece of trash!!,"Apart from the fact that NO one in this film can act!! And apart from the fact that they show you the murderer BEFORE the Fright Break.......well, there really is not much going for this piece of celuTrash whatsoever!!!! Unless of course you may want to pick it up to see the Glam Rock band who play at the school dance (the only reason I myself have a copy).I sometimes hate to admit that yes, I am the singer of that band. It was a while ago now and I do look a lot different, but with this movie in particular, it can't possibly be rated anymore than Hitler can be called, ah, CUTE!!!Buy it for a laugh and for the band.......but don't buy it for any frightening entertainment value.Should be paying US to watch it!!!!"
3,dvd review,"great service and delivery, only problem was the movie, not the one I thought it was, but thanks"
3,bloodmoon,"a great movie--for a night, wrapped up on the couch with the lights all off--have your girlfriend there and the movie will be twice as exciting--anyone have ""the great bikini off road adventure""--i am at dwc@travrese.net-please let me know-really want that movie."
4,My favorite Village People album,"This contains YMCA, which is the most popular Village People song as well as being one of the most popular disco songs ever. But in my opinion, the best song on this album is The Women, which is not available on any Greatest Hits album. For that reason alone, I bought this CD. I definitely recommend it."
4,Excellent history,"Abel provides a very good period review of Civil War issues in MO and AR. The prose is dated, bui the data and history are quite interesting. Researchers and serious students of the era, however, will find the Kindle version rather awkward to use."
4,"Corruption at the highest level; interesting, informative","I recommend this engrossing account of secret power struggles in Central America during the 1970's and 1980's. Reading this book was enlightening, and more than a little disturbing. I think few people realize how incredibly corrupt the CIA has been throughout its history.The authors ordered chapters logically, with several sub-sections to break up the reading. The research is impeccable -- there are extensive notes referencing authoritative sources.The only significant flaw is the writing style which is hard to follow at times. Imagine reading a novel which has dozens of characters, some of whom never show up again. The authors do not bother to explain in detail many of the people introduced in the book. I would have appreciated better summaries and background information."
1,Misleading Description,"I purchased this after calling the manufacturer. It is described as 400W but can't be more than 50W at the most because it distorts so easily. The wireless transmitter did not work. The company told me to send it in and after 4 weeks they told me they could not repair it. Overall, my experience has not been positive and I would not recommend the item. Spend more money and get something that will work."
5,Delicious Apple Jelly,At first I had a hard time finding Apple Jelly. Then I found it on Amazon with the Barry Farm. The Barry Farm Apple Jelly is the best apple jelly I've ever tasted. It's not too sweet and not too tart. It's just right. The best part for me is that this product did not trigger my migraine headaches like so many other products because of artificial flavoring and coloring. Barry Farm uses natural ingredients. It is simply delicious. I highly recommend this product to all apple jelly lovers.
3,Not so much.............,"I've had so much trouble finding apple jelly for sauce recipes ( in this case a spiced ham sauce) that I was delighted to find one here on Amazon! Unfortunately, the flavor was pretty soft and bland.....not particularly ""apple"" flavored, and it was also runny....... which is odd for apple, which is very high in pectin! I'll have to keep looking."
3,Stars & Swastikas hard cover book,"I was eager to read this book after having attended a lecture by the author , who happens to live a few miles from my home . I should have bought the newer paperback at his program rather than trying to save money buying it on line . The book was described as being in good condition but it was a (very) used library book ."
4,"Fun, but get it on CD Baby","Just go to their website and get it on CD Baby.I have a soft spot for all this ""jug-band noir"" stuff that's coming out now. The Devil Makes Three is easy to listen to and fun in its own black-humor kind of way."
5,"A Solid Album, Beginning to the End","Devil Makes Three has a distinctive bluegrass-punk sound. The three members put out a lot of good, fun, upbeat music and when you listen to it, you'll be happy. They do some of their own music and some covers (I didn't know originally they were covers), but they make the music sound as if it's their own. Nowadays, other bands are covering songs of the Devil Makes Three. Their music is so good and their live performances are so fun that they've gone from playing small clubs to playing large clubs (800 people or so). Anyway, the CD is strong and it's not one I get tired of hearing. I've got about 900 or so CDs and none have the sound of a Devil Makes Three CD. Enjoy."
1,Ugh.,"I saw Maria breathlessly hawking this book on the Home Shopping Network. What a sorry perfomance, almost as bad as the vapor-text that fills the pages of this dumb book.Shame on Maria. Stick to hyperventilating on the floor of the NYSE and leave the book writing to someone with ideas and real insight."
1,Do NOT Buy This Book!,"This book is a joke. After the billions lost by individual investors because of Maria Bartiromo and CNBC, no one in their right mind would even consider purchasing this book. It is completely unreadable. There are many other fine books out there that would help you become educated about the stock market, but this is certainly not one of them. Because of this book, only more investors will become misinformed and harmed."
1,"Marketing Gimmick, Typical Shallow Maria","Since her 1999 ascension to CNBC lead anchor, Maria's relentless shilling for Wall Street (and her early nervousness that practically had her hyper)has been a constant symbol of the trivialization of CNBC. Maria's husband's magazine, Individual Investor, folded as will Maria's CNBC career after a couple more years of repeated miscalling the current bear market. This book breaks no new ground because Maria makes her living on her looks, not on her market knowledge. What little advice here can be found on several free market-related sites.CNBC anchor Bill Griffeth did release a couple of good books back in 94-95. Avoid this owl-like waif's puff piece."
3,Dry..,"The book is interesting in a since that it was written by a person who has been exposed to some of the most prominent people/events. On the other hand, I believe that it has very little practical use."
1,Maria is anti-Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD),She believes only institutional investors are worthy of hearing about company announcements. Would you want to read a book written by someone holding that view?
1,You have to be kidding me,The only way Maria Bartiromo can make money in any economy is by selling this book to anyone foolish enough to buy it. I didn't realize being a television personality makes you an expert on the market.
1,"Oh, Puh-lease!","This book is full of the same so called ""plugged in"" sources that enabled CNBC to lead the individual investor down the garden path. CNBC, including Bartiromo, has done more than any single source to misinform people about what was really happening in favor of their pandering to the many analysts and money managers who use that forum to hype their own agenda and that of their employers. In short, they sold out to their advertisers at the cost of their audience. $4-5 Trillion dollars went to money heaven and no one who watched CNBC got any help from the guests THEY CHOSE, or their ""questioners"" in understanding the debacle as it unfolded. This book is just more of the same. NOT ONE source she lists in this book were among the many who warned -- well ahead of time -- to take the once in a lifetime profits and run. These independent voices were uniformly shunned by CNBC, and are conspicuous by their absences in this book. She, nor her ""insiders"" listed in this book, are to be trusted. JB"
3,Nothing to do with making money !!!,"Unfortunately, the title of this book is not reflective of its contents. I do respect Maria as a reporter and a personable and good one, however when you choose such a title , readers are expecting concrete strategies to make money in this difficult market, which this book does not address. If you are fascinated by Maria's life story and the people she interacts with this may be a good read to fulfill your curiosity. If ,however you are interested in actual real life making money strategies try: ""the Stcock Trader "" by OZ and ""Generate thousands in cash on your stocks without selling them "" by Elias. Both contain actual real life examples."
1,Maria is a hypocrite,The same analysts she promotes and gives credibility to on TV she now says that you shouldn't listen to in her book. Reading this book just proves that she knows absolutely nothing about the stock market. You have got to be a fool to buy this book. She doesn't care if you make money or not.
1,Maria is an unnecessary noise.,"If you feel you need this book in order to succeed in the markets, you need to be examined by a psychiatrist."
1,A terrible book ...,"Simply another marketing exercise of tying a book, any book, to an attractive face with some media exposure to make some quick money. Not much difference between this and a Life Philosophy book by Vanna White or a biography of Britney Spears. The content is basic new investor instruction that you can find done better and for free at Web sites like Motley Fool and others. Very badly organized with lots of extraneous material ... this book is at least two rewrites away from an acceptable first effort. Look elsewhere, friend."
1,"Maria, practice what you preach.","What's said in this book is reasonable, but how do you take seriously an author who warns you that everybody has an agenda in the book, yet did not practice what she preached?Did she ever tell you if a stock she's touting in the morning is in the hedge fund run by her husband? When she talked about Symbol Tech. did she ever tell you her father-in-law was a major shareholder?How can a financial reporter be literally in bed with a money manager and still have any integrity?"
1,Maria doesn't believe in her own advices...,"My problem with Bartiromo has been explained by many previous reviewers. While everything she wrote sounds sensible - in theory, in reality she has no actual investment experience and worse yet, does _exactly_ all those things she tells investors not to do in her book. So, either she doesn't believe in her own advice, or she doesn't care what she does as long as it gets ratings, whatever that's left.I've also read Navigate the Noise and will write a review of it later. To sum it up here, that's a much better, and much more _credible_, book on the same topic."
1,Extremely amateurish and naive views of the markets,"Maria promotes the very concept that led so many naive and inexperienced investors to disaster -- that is, seeking advice from so-called ""professionals""."
3,Not as bad as some think,"...I happen to think she is a very smart and charismatic woman, in addition to being strikingly beautiful. This book is aimed at investing novices...I was left pretty much clueless about investing. I relied on him to do all that. This book was a real help in those dark times. Bravo!"
3,Good advice for Amateur Investors,"This is an interesting book, if only for the amount of websites and information resources that are available to the average person. It also attempts to identify future trends in general terms and how to interpret market data. There is a major drawback to me, however, and that is... MARIA TALKS ABOUT HERSELF TOO MUCH! To paraphrase a joke about Henry Kissinger, Ms. Bartiromo should have titled her book ""Famous People Who Have Met Me"". None the less, it is an interesting read, mainly dispensing common-sense information that can make the average investor think ""out of the box"""
5,Review on copper hanging colander,"This item is very well made, and looks great. i have used it several times, the depth makes up for the width so it really can hold alot. Very satisfied purchaseTerry"
1,not compatible,Product description says it works on Mac but does not.... on current version; maybe referring to the first ever Mac made ; but unuseable. Gave for gift and embarrassing to find this out.
2,Kinda dissapointing,"I was hoping this ribbed condom would be a great experience for both of us, but my wife got nothing out of it more than a non ribbed one. The ribs are so small they just do not provide the claimed ""Extra Pleasure for Her"". The quality is as good or better than other condoms I have used, but not worth any extra money for the claimed additional experience. Makes you wonder who they test these type of products on. I would be happy to try one as a product tester and supply feedback rather than as a dissapointed consumer."
4,One of the most useful books in the universe for teachers and therapists.,"I used the information in this book years ago to help my daughterunderstand that even though her sons teachers in middle school told himhe was stupid and wouldn't amount to anything, that the teachers werewrong. They taught only to auditory and visual learners. My grandson,is primarily a kinesthetic learner with hearing loss in one ear and is arthritic. Hewas then placed in an alternative school where he could learn on histerms and graduated this year as a Senior in 2012. He excels inbasketball and volleyball helping his teams be in 1st place during his time there. Icurrently purchased this book for a Special Needs teacher who was havingsimilar difficulty teaching a student in her class. Sounds like a 'kinesthetic' learnerI said. She looked puzzled as she has been teaching for years without knowingthese children need a different and hands on approach to learning. I sent her this book."
5,The BEST Kiss Album EVER!,"Somehow, this album is overlooked. I mean, this has got classics like the title track, Goin' Blind, Parasite, All The Way, Let Me Go Rock n Roll, Got To Choose, Strange Ways, Mainline, Comin' Home & Watchin' You. WAIT A MINUTE! I just listed the ENTIRE album! Take that as a hint people. This is THE best Kiss album of all time. And I've been a Kiss freak since the beginning & I know what I'm talkin' 'bout Willis!!"
4,You Can hear the Desperation and drive for success..........,"Hotter than Hell is the 2nd KISS album and the production is much different from their debut. Dark and sludgy, you can literally hear and feel the cold winter they spent in New York creating these songs. Got to Choose is much slower and Sabbath-ythan the live version. There really isn't a poor cut on the album. Mainline and Comin' home are two classics, as is Goin' Blind. Ace once said that KISS practised in an unheated loft in NYC and used egg crates for insulation. Hotter Than Hell provides a glimpse into Kiss's world before they were millionaires- a world of complete indifference to what they were trying to do. Only the 4 of them and a few others believed.Fortunately, times were to change.I love this album for the FEEL. Next to Destroyer, their best."
5,Vintage KISStory,"Hotter than Hell is arguably the freest and most relaxed of the KISS albums. Released a year before Dressed to Kill and Alive!, this CD just reeks of simple, full-tilt rock'n'roll party music. It also includes the first near-ballad by KISS, ""Goin' Blind"". But by far the best musicianship is on the songs ""Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll"" (think ""Elvis meets Chuck Berry in a dark alley""), and Ace Frehley's long, cosmic soloing on ""Strange Ways"".GET THIS. NOW."
5,This album was the first recorded,"I am so surprised that none of these reviewers seem to know that this was the first record ,produced by Kenny Kerner and Ritchie Wise. They couldn't sell it ,so the band signed with Bill Aucoin and the rest is history. Just thought you all deserved to know."
3,sorry its not ace but rick on guitar,"a great album but to all the reviews that comment on frehleys guitar playing be aware it was rick derringer who is the uncredited guitar player on this album. my source genes book and rick derringer himself who I talked to in person about all his work in the studio, still a classic album no matter who is on lead guitar...............PK"
2,NOT MUCH HERE,"I agree with pmdawn below. Strum a little, scream a lot. Recording is unspeakably shallow - even for the cough syrup crowd. 2stars only for their glimpse of the future. Eventually, KISS did produce a few gems. But none are found in ""...Hell...""."
5,Absoulute Classic of all time,"My favorite Kiss record is this one...Every song on here RULES!!!...great songs like Hotter Than Hell, Mainline, Watching you, Going Blind, and Let me go Rock N Roll define Kiss to the T...The best record in Kisstory"
4,One of their better early efforts,Don't laugh. This is a very good album and it stayed in constant rotation on my turntable when it first came out.It's a rock guitar dream come true. Just listen to Strange Ways and tell me Ace can't play some fantastic guitar. This was in the days when they were struggling to make a name for themselves. Not the greatest sound quality. Still this is one for a true fan of the band and anyone who loves 70's hard rock guitar.
3,Energetic and listenable.,"Hotter Than Hell is a pretty good album from Kiss. I think that all of the songs are energetic and listenable. There's a total of ten tracks, and the album is in a straight-ahead hard rock musical direction. The musicianship and songwriting are good, while the production is okay. There are some nice guitar riffs and solos throughout. The songs that I like the most are ""Strange Ways,"" ""Hotter Than Hell,"" and ""Parasite."" I like the thick guitar riffs on ""Strange Ways."" The guitar solo has a nice liquid tone, also. ""Parasite"" sports some catchy guitar playing. The vocals from all of the guys are also lively and satisfying. Hotter Than Hell is worth a listen."
4,Hard and Raw second album!,"HOTTER THAN HELL(1974)is probably the most important remaster because it may have needed it the most. There is no other album that has the gritty, nasty, sound that this one does. More classics from ALIVE!(1975) are here, like ""Got to choose"", ""Hotter"", ""Let me go"", and one of my personal favorites, ""Parasite"". The album also features some great lesser known gems like ""Comin' home"", ""Goin' blind"", and ""Strange ways"", probably one of the heaviest KISS songs. HOTTER THAN HELL was recorded differently than any other album but it stands out because of it. The follow up to the classic debut KISS(1974) won't let you down. Another KISS essential."
5,Poor Production???,"This album is one of Kiss' best. The songs are well written (for the most part - barring the usual KISS cheese factor) Ace's solos are some of his best, the emotive quality of Gene's backing vocals (check out ""got to choose"") will bring you to your knees. There seems to be a general consensus about the production and that it is somehow of inferior quality. I can't help but wonder with what template these people are measuring? I can, to some degree, understand why people might say this but ultimately this viewpoint is the sentiment of the amateur audiophile.There is a lot of production gold to be extracted if you know how to listen. The quality is very unique (vs. poor). It was probably done on the cheap, sure BUT if that is the case, what was created - by most probably overlapping demo tracks with ""cleaner"" tracks - manifested one of the MOST unique sounding rock albums in existence... nothing I have ever heard sounds anything like it. And whatever ""it"" is, I want more!"
5,"Imo, this Kiss album is da best and da heaviest","Also, at this point, Kiss functioned more as a democratic unit than in later years when Simmons and Stanley took over as da de facto leaders of the band. Peter and Ace were still very much ""in da game"" @ dis point. Great songs evidence this: Strange Days (Peter lead vocal),the title track, Hotter Than Hell (Ace lead vocal, i believe) Got to Choose, Goin Blind, Parasite and Let Me Go Rock N Roll (Gene Simmons is also on a roll songwriting-wise on dis joint). Kiss has only one other album in their catalog that even gets close to matching in da ""heavy"" category, that would be '83's Creatures Of The Night."
3,Hotter Than Hell (1974),"Hotter Than Hell was released the same year that Kiss released their debut album. Hotter Than Hell is slightly weaker than Kiss, but considering that Kiss's second album followed their debut by months, Hotter Than Hell is a pretty good effort. Highlights include Watchin' You, and Hotter Than Hell. At this point Kiss were showmen, and had yet to find a way to capture that talent onto record."
4,Good album,I agree with most that the production of this album could have been better. That's why I gave it 4 stars. The album is good though. The attitude is there.
4,Legitimately Bitchin',"Pre-ALIVE! KISS gets a bum rap, but I've never understood why. The first three albums are lil' lo-fi wonders, and HOTTER THAN HELL is my favorite of the bunch. ""Goin' Blind"" is insane, and oddly affecting -- Ace's ""Parasite"" is pure cartoon glamour...."
5,IT REALLY IS HOTTER THAN HELL!,"THIS ONE'S MAYBE KISS BEST ALBUM YET! I REALLY LOVE IT!IT'S HEAVY!SOME SONGS ARE SOME OF KISS GREATEST SONGS!GOT TO CHOOSE:9/10. HOT RIFF! GREAT BASS LINE!I ENJOY THIS SONG!PARASITE:10/10.THE RIFF IS HOTTER THAN HELL!MAYBE KISS BEST SONGGOIN' BLIND:10/10. KISS BEST BALLAD! GENE'S SOUNDS GREAT!HOTTER THAN HELL:10/10. HEAVY SONG! HOT, HEAVY RIFF!LET ME GO, ROCK `N' ROLL:7/10.I'VE NEVER ENJOYED IT, BUT GOOD!ALL THE WAY:8/10. GREAT SONG. GENE'S VOCALS ARE GOOD ON IT!WATCHIN' YOU:10/10. HOT! GREAT SONG! IT'S A LITTLE BIT HEAVY!MAILINE:6/10. I'VE NEVER LIKE THIS ONE, BUT IT DOESN'T SUCK!COMIN' HOME:6/10. NOT TO GOOD,BUT NOT BAD EITHER!STRANGE WAYS:10/10. HEAVY, GREAT SONG! I LOVE IT! GREAT WRITING!"
3,Sophomore Slump,"A decent KISS CD but only about half the songs are good. ""All the Way"" is absolutely horrible. Only recommended if you're a true-blue KISS fan."
5,The best ever!!!!!!!,"By far Kiss's finest achievement. Their isn't a flaw on this record. I only dreamed if the band would play this in their concert the whole record. Classics like GoinBLIND,Comin'Homeand Mainline should be played live. THe best in Kisstory!!!!"
5,KISS HOTTER THAN HELL,"Hotter Than Hell is the second studio album from the group Kiss. It was certified Gold on June 23, 1977, having sold 500,000 copies. The album was re-released in 1997 (along with most of Kiss' earlier albums) in a remastered version. The album peaked on the charts at number 100 without the benefit of a hit single."
4,A sorely underrated second outing from KISS.,"This album for some reason is, ""The Forgotten KISS Album"". This album is very raw and is much closer to the band's live sound than their first album. Once again, Kenny Kerner and Richie Wise were on hand for production, and they actually managed to do a worse job than on the first album. The album sounds as though it were recorded in a tunnel. However, this album rocks in every sense of the word. Got To Choose, Parasite, and Watchin' You are among my favorite Kiss Klassics. This album deserved a much better production job and better sales than it received."
4,Better atempt,"The second album still sounds like the first one, but you can tell that Kiss' songwriting skills were sharpening. Though many of the songs drag, Kiss is still Kiss, and that's reason enough to have this one."
4,IT LIVES UP TO ITS TITLE,"THIS WAS THE MY VERY FIRST KISS ALBUM WAY BACK IN 1976,AND I'VE BEEN A SOLDIER IN THE KISS ARMY(THE BANDS FAN CLUB)EVER SINCE. NOT THIER BEST WORK, BUT CERTAINLY FAR FROM THIER WORST,IT WILL RIVET YOU TO THE SPEAKERS UNTIL YOUR MOM COMES AND UNPLUGS YOUR STEREO!"
1,Glorified Cardbord Junk,"I purchased this item several months ago and never got around to leaving feedback.It is not nearly as sturdy as it looks. It is constructed of panels of some kind of fiber board that is about 1/8 inch thick, each framed by 2"" by 1/2"" slats. I had to reinforce the inside corners with scrap wood, as well as glue it back together - parts of it were falling apart when I got it.The paint job was negligible, barely a primer coat - I could see the base material through it. I had to apply three coats of paint to make it look right. Considering that the product is made in China, I'm probably better off having sealed it up in fresh paint that I KNOW doesn't contain lead or who knows what else.I will NEVER buy furniture online again. Over and over I have read reviews by others for other furniture that is similar to mine. This piece of junk may be worth $20 (shipping included) - but nowhere near the $60 that I paid for it. What a rip."
3,"Cute, but not very sturdy","This product looks super cute in my bathroom, but it's not very sturdy. I think it'll last a while only b/c I live by myself, and I make sure to be very gentle with it."
4,Nice hamper,"I was looking for a simple hamper for my bathroom, with an elegant look to it that wasn't plastic or wicker and this fits the bill. We did have to put it together, and there were a couple of chips in the back that were damaged in transit. The white paint on all 3 of the sides were perfect though, and we simply used a little wood glue on the chips in back and fixed it just fine. In the end, it is still just a hamper. The wood is very white, and looks very nice. The corners are quite sharp and you'll want it in a place where you won't run a hip into it in the middle of the night! But it is very nice and we're quite pleased with it."
2,Not much for the money.,"I ordered one of these knock-down hampers. It arrived as described but I found it to be smaller than I imagined it and the construction leaves something to be desired. While it is nominally made of wood, the wood is a very weak strain and doesn't seem sturdy. The panels are like beadboard but aren't very heavy duty either. The lid hinges look to last about ten uses.I put it together but am going to add some reinforcement at the corners, heavier hinges and a strap to prevent the lid from opening past 90 degrees.There isn't anything I can do about the limited capacity though except try to find an alternate use for this hamper so I can get another larger one."
1,very disappointed,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing this product. It was easy to put together but I got a shock when I saw how small the box it came in was. It was much smaller than I expected. If you are using it as a laundry hamper, it will be full with a few socks! Also, most of the similar products online had a cloth liner. This one doesnt come with one. I am very disappointed but kept it as it would cost too much to ship it back. Hopefully I will find another use for it."
5,for a lost soldier,"I must say that i really enjoyed the movie and all, there could have been a little more nudity but other wise a great movie. Have watched it several times now and still feel that I am happy with what i saw on the DVD."
4,YOU WILL BE SURPRISED,"It is difficult not to be drawn into this period-perfect, wistful and melancholy film about first love and memory. The performances are wonderful, and the score is achingly sweet. And the European sensibility and sensitivity in handling this truthful relationship will have you nearly breathless in its candor. There is nothing sacrosanct or repulsive or even lecherous about this movie, it just IS. And the performance of the child will haunt you."
4,A good movie with love that comes from the heart,A good heart warming movie. Its background is Nazi occupied country somewhere near the Dutch. It deals with a boy who has to leave his family and live with strangers in the counry side because there isn't enough food. He later meets a soldier and they fall in love. The movie is tactfully done but it deals with the taboo subject of boy love. Recommended for those who keep a open mind to true love.
3,Not in English,"The movie is OK, but they don't tell you it is not in English. Amazon lists the langauge as English, and there is some, but most of the movie is in Dutch or German with subtitles."
1,Way outta line,"I remember well being a young, hurt and wounded young man. My parents divorced, my father a raging alcoholic that could care less about me, my mother displaced by mental illness when I was 14. I longed for some form of intimacy from anywhere, and I could easily have caved to intimacy from another male. I was lucky to have had a chance to align with my normal heterosexual being later in life. I have a lot of gay acquaintances, and perhaps some are a true genetic tendency, but one has to wonder how much a young man's environment can play on his sexual and emotional tendencies. I see this soldier as nothing more than predator of this young man's pain, and a possible predator of young boys in the future."
5,A forgotten film that explores sexual adult situations!,"""For a lost soldier"" is one of these controversial films that demands from the viewer a whole maturity and absolute conveyance, because deals with complex psychological behaviour, into the distorted ambiance of a relentless war, where the feelings sometimes stand out of a thoughtful control.At the end of the WW2 , a boy of just 12, initiates his sexual awake with a Canadian soldier who works out as his handsome liberator.Previously we had the chance to watch ""Midnight porter"" where the process of psychical dislocation tends to be cloud the senses, the normal logic of what we assume as normal, but this serious and mature approach makes of this film unique in its genre.Don't miss it!"
3,Nice but overrated,"There's nothing wrong with this movie in terms of cinematics, acting, directing, and quality of writing. It is sincere, character-driven and real. A caveat: To appreciate it at all you have to put aside the conviction that a relationship between a man and a boy is always wrong.Those things said, there is nothing particularly excellent about this movie. It is touching, nostalgic, and truthful, but it is none of these things to the point of truly affecting your heart. Part of the reason is that it's too short, another part is that the ambiance (editing/music/so forth) are not very well done, and another part may be simply that I had read so many extremely complimentary reviews that my expectations were just too high.It's a nice movie... but don't expect a masterpiece."
5,Excellent - this is definitely a classic,"This is a classic movie with a very good ""simple"" look at life in the Netherlands. Like all good movies, it does not shy away from mixing religious scenes with secular. Good father-son type movie, though it has subtle controversial elements in it that will be offensive and suggestive to some, concerning the actual relationship between the boy and the Canadian soldier. If you look at the overall theme, however, there is a very basic element of friendship that is lost in much of modern life."
5,Tremendous Exam Book!,"I used this book as my main study guide, and found it to be right on. It was easy enough for a beginner to understand, yet thorough enough to help me pass the exam. The CD is unusually well done. Oh yeah, the pull out cram book is worth the price alone. Get this book if you want to pass."
3,Oops !!,"A good book for content, but don't look at the pictures. Not sure how this one got by, but a lot of the Figures in this book where wrong. When talking about RAS, the Figure showed a ""Migration Tool For NewWare"" picture. This kind of thing happened more that once or twice. I found this very distracting. The book also covered a lot of registry stuff, none of which will be on any test."
4,A Colorful Rendition of Sherlock Holmes's Sleuthing Debut,"A man is found dead in an empty house, with a single word, ""Rache""--the German word for Revenge--written in blood on the wall. Edginton and Culbard produce a colorful rendition of Sherlock Holmes's sleuthing debut that young readers will be able to both understand and enjoy. Recommended for Ages 13-Up."
3,Don't forget that this is FICTION.,"I had never read a Sherlock Holmes book until this week. I decided to begin with the first. It was amuzing, well written, intruiging, and then suddenly I'm thrown for a loop when it makes the Mormons out to be murdering kidnappers. I was so disturbed by this at first, that it almost ruined the book for me, but then I realize that you have to forgive Doyle because in 1887 information on Mormons was scarce and shady. It was a fairly new organization at that time and the biblical practice of polygamy that was practiced by a few of the members was very hated, as would be expected. But we must remember that Doyle was writing a work of fiction, and historical accuracy is unnecessary for a good story, and this is definitely a good mystery that is well written. I look forward to reading more of the adventures of Watson and Holmes (hopefully without any more slandering of Christians)."
2,Mildly Entertaining,"If you're going to start reading Sherlock Holmes, this as good a place as any to start since it introduces Holmes and Watson and how by chance they met.Holmes' inductions/deductions border silly in this intercontinental tale of murderous revenge.This story was not good enough for me to go out and read more Sherlock Holmes - I'll put it that way.I'd say stick to the Pocket Classics instead of wasting your time on the whole book."
2,It doesn't measure up to other Sherlock Holmes mysteries...,"It starts off very interesting, and it's special because it's the first Sherlock Holmes novel and we get to experience his first encounter with Watson. I won't give plot spoilers, but Holmes investigates a murder, study's the crime scene, and effortlessly shows he's more creative thinking and superior methods to the other investigators of the case, and so begins his search for the truth. Early on, the mystery is so well set up on so many levels, but unfortunately, somewhere in the middle of the book, Doyle lost me, I began counting the pages, it got boring and I wanted it to end, it just lost its momentum. I think because the book is sort of 2 stories in 1, Holmes has a long flashback and it kind of felt disjointed to me. I would suggest you read a different Sherlock Holmes book, there are better ones. ""The Hound of Baskervilles"" is much better than this book."
1,12 inches?,Do you know what is 12 inches regarding this ball?That's how high it bounces when you slam it to the ground pissed off that it is actually 8 inches!Lying scummy dishonest seller.(plus it's about as cheap a ball as you can find.....)
3,"Tough to blow up, but good size","I bought this beach ball for my 10 month old, who loves to throw it and chase it around the house. It's definitely a small size, but easy for him to grab and throw. It's tough to blow it up because its so small, by the time I get the fastener closed I feel like I've let out half the air - so be quick!"
1,Not a 12in ball,This is not a 12in ball and it is about 10in. It is hard to blow air and seal it. This is not a quality product and it is a waste of money.
5,PERFECT,"Perfect match for my hunter fan and just the right length for my 19' ceiling. Relatively easy to install but, needs extra wire. Make sure no wires are exposed in your splices (especially inside the rod) to avoid shorting. This is a great product and recommended"
5,born free as free as the wind blows,"i feel that Sex and the single mom was a opening film to relationshops.The bond between the mom and daughter was... fascinateing, But at points in watching I thought that they were lovers not mother and daughter. The film really spoke to me and gave me quite a lot to think about."
3,this was a good movie,"I personally don't understand why you people are trashing this movie. It was very well written, and if any of you had actually seen it, you would see that she was trying to keep her daughter from making the same mistake that she did that way she wouldnt have to suffer the same heart aches and breaks. She was still her mother no matter what, just because she messed up once, does not give her daughter the right to be promiscuous. I agree with that. Those of you that have trashed this film, should have looked at the title more carefully. Hello! what were you expecting?"
1,wrong review,"I bought this dvd thinking it was the second one but more sex and the single mom, but instead it's the first. I read the reviews they all was discussing the plot of the second movie but they were mistaken so I ended up with two of the same movies."
3,Trials of tribulations of a great comic,For those that knew him on TV and always wondered about his life this is a good book. I believe there is a more recent biography though.
5,"Funny, Inspiring, and Moving!","This is probably my favorite of all the Bob Hope DVDs. It's funny, entertaining and moving. Bob travels the world visiting the troops protecting our country, with him comes a plethora of stars, some of which are entertainers while others aren't. For example, in one episode Bob brings Connie Stevens with him and in another he brings along one of the first men on the moon, Neil Armstrong.It's inspiring to see how entertainment had an impact on the lives of the soldiers. When Bob Hope could have been sitting safe in the US, he chose the ladder and put himself on the line, simply to entertainer those who put their lives on the line for our freedom. It's unfortunate that we don't see behavior like this anymore. I guess it just isn't safe."
5,Best wallet I've ever owned!,"I've gone through a lot of wallets in the past 5 years or so, A modern life has different needs then the oens older wallets were designed for. I carry a bit of cash, a few coupons, some business cards and a TON of plastic cards.This is the first wallet I've owned that has the space to comfortably hold every card I own. When my wife first looked at it she was taken aback by its dimensions but I've had it quite a few months now and even she has to admit it looks great. While it is big, it sits flat in my pocket, unlike the unsightly bulges my old wallets created. And because its made of good leather and is not being stretched to capacity, I expect it to last a long time.Well worth every dime I spent on it!"
4,Great buy!,"This is such a great buy! All condoms had durex brand name on them and had a great variety. Only about 12 of them were unlubricated and we don't personally use those, but its a variety pack and some people do. Its still with out those 12 an absolute great buy. When you buy them at the store its usually 12.99 for around ten of them! Maybe ill use the unlubed ones to decorate a bachelorette/bachelor party with or the honeymoon car!"
3,Average Condom,"This is not a frills product, but an average condom which simply does the job and nothing else. The seller was very quick with delivery, so I would recommend his service, but if you are looking for a more exciting product, well, this is not it. Useful, practical, and average at the best. Nothing more!"
5,Great condoms,"60 condoms, all durex. I really don't notice much difference between the various varieties but they work great."
2,search for bettet options,"I bought this product , I received 60 condoms there was no varieties the 60 condom was divided between 3 types , and I received more than 20 condom without lubricant . Really wast of money"
1,The Worst,"***** Do not, under any circumstances, ever order anything from these people. If you google CondomMan.com and read the reviews, there are dozens of complaints***I ordered from these guys on the 14th of September. On the 24th of September I asked them where my order was. I got the following email:Hello, Thank you for your email and your recent order. Your item was shipped out recently, and you should receive it very soon. If you don't have your item within the next 3-4 days, please let us know and we will investigate for you.Thank you and have a good day,raeOk, its now the 6th of October, nothing. I will be calling my bank tomorrow, closing my card and having the charges reversed for this order."
1,Beware and be careful,"I placed an order with CondomMan on November 26,they took the money from my credit card on December 2, as of Dec. 15th I have not received my order. I called several times and got an answering machine which said its message bin was full, so it would not take my inquiry. I E-Mailed and asked for an update on my shipment, and got no reply at all. I doubt I will ever get my order or my money back."
1,NOT lubricated,They came fast but without any box from Durex.They were just bundled with a rubberband and taped to card board..woest part - they dont have any description on the individual cover...I was annoyed to see no-lubricated condoms. Total turn off!
1,Smells terrible,"I can't use these because of the smell. I know they're a bargain brand, but the smell is pretty intolerable in my opinion."
2,Not what I expected,These are not the same quality of other Durex condoms. They seem very cheaply made. If you are looking for the normal Durex quality I recommend getting the 36 count Variety Pack.
1,thank goodness for plan b...,"my boyfriend and i have had 3 of these break on us out of about 20...used perfectly properly. avoid these, girls"
3,Okamoto leads the race..,"This was the first product that I tried. But my GF never felt comfortable with this and she always complained that she did not feel anything. Further this assorted mix pack had some which are not in a good condition at all. They appeared as if they were left overs. Then I ordered Okamoto Crown (Blue pack) once, and it was a charm, the first day itself I felt the difference. After reading reviews from several others, I felt I was lucky to find Crown just in my second attempt.You will not be disappointed.. and dont waste too much time and money on others.. Try this.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XFWPE/ref=oss_product"
4,Quality and value,"The Condoms are of good quality and a great value for how many you get in the varied pack. Unfortunately i found out i only like one type out of the four, but that has nothing to do with who theyre sold by."
4,...,"Well, personally, i think its a great deal, but after getting them I figured out my partner is just too big for them D:< even the love ones, so it didn't work out very well. Its an amazing deal none the less."
5,Most pompt in delivery & countabilty of their products!,I have order from condomman several times in the past and have always got prompt service.As far as condoms breaking that has to do with size of your male parts. The type of the condom you need to beware of ( if you have a larger than average penis like me ) is using ultra thin or any condoms that tell you there extra thin.I always order the 60 count and never had a problem with durex ultra thin but every time i used trojons ultra thin they broke and i have two kids to prove it.
5,Incredible Deal!,"60 condoms for 7.99???? Wow! They also sell 48 condoms and 2 vibrating rings for the same price. I do enjoy the quiverful pleasures offered by the vibrating ring, but with the extra 12 condoms, I can score that many more times for the same price! I'll gladly trade that quivering for 12 more times. Durex rolls out an astounding variety with the following lines of condoms: Extra Sensitive, Performax, Maximum Love and Intense Sensation. Personally, I like the Performax, 'cause I'm all about performance."
3,Bag of condoms,They came in a plastic bag. Not so much a variety pack - about 40 of them were the regular ones (pictured).
2,The sealed plastic package was torn open and condoms were missing!!,"After reading other people's reviews, I wasn't expecting much in the way of packaging, but I at least assumed the bag of condoms would be sealed and not tampered with. When I opened the amazon box that they were shipped in, I noticed that the sealed plastic bag that the condoms came in had been ripped open. Not only that, but 3 of the condoms were missing (1 of each kind.) Really? So, at the least, some poor moron can't afford their own condoms. But I'm not convinced that was all they did. How do I know they were not otherwise tampered with? I will not be using any of the remaining 57 condoms. What a waste. I have used durex condoms in the past and have no complaints about that company, however, I would not recommend purchasing anything from this seller."
3,Blue ones are not lubricated,Pros:1. Shipping was fast2. Packing was ok3. Package had all 60 as mentionedCons:1. Surprised to find some blue(outside) color (10-12 so far) which wasn't lubricated and almost like a hand glove. Others were awesome as I expected.Bottomline: If you are comfortable with non-lubricated ones its a awesome deal.
2,less no. of condoms,heyI thought I would get the condoms in a gif pack or box. it was in zip lock bag which looks so cheap. I know the price cant be beaten but i got less number.they sent me 30 instead of 60 condoms which is absurd.
3,No trojan,These are no trojan and definitely don't have the best lube on them. They are what they are cheap condoms that get the job done.
1,very misleading packaging!,"24 Durex condoms arrived in ZIPLOCK bag! Gross, unsafe and unsanitary! Picture has original box. As a buyer, I would expect my product to arrive in an original box as advertised, not transferred to a ziplock bag with a homemade style label taped across the bag with printed expiration. Should not be 1 star, 0 star."
5,Just want I wanted,"The box had a great variety and was definitely worth the money. good brand, good quality, good feeling ;)I have bought this item on more than one occasion. I like to mix it up!"
5,This was perfect condom.,This product was perfect for sex. Best Durex condom for preventing baby. This wass much cheaper than a regular price. Thank you for sharing this product in Amazon.com.
2,Incorrect description,"The description of the product lists the following condoms as being included: ""Extra Sensitive, Performax, Maximum Love and Intense Sensation"". What I received was Maximum Love, Natural Feeling, Enhanced Pleasure and a variety of flavored ones.The quality is fine, but the selection you receive appears to be random."
2,Missing a few from the order.,"Was shorted. Received 56 instead of 60 as listed. Product looks to be fine though as far as I can tell, nothing is expired."
3,My Review,The product is decent. In my own perspective the product was too small for me but worked. I am aware that the product is supposed to be tight but shouldn't suffocate my penis. Feeling was good with 4 varieties. 3 Were lubricated only slightly and 1 wasnt at all.Did include a coupon incase i ever buy again!
5,All good,This is a great choice because you can save a lot of money. They all seemed to be in perfect condition. Would definitely repeat
5,cheap durex condoms :),best condoms at cheap price. and lots of them !!!! definitely better then buying 3 packs in pharmacy's for 5 bucks !!!
4,I like most of the condoms,"Most of the condoms are great, but we are having some trouble with the apple flavored ones, as they irritate us during sexy-times!"
2,What was I thinking,"Don't buy a 60 condom variety pack! You may find, like I did, that you hate 1/3 of these condoms. If you are going to get a variety pack to see what you like, then get a smaller one (like 5-10). Then buy what you like. Honestly though after using this brand I'm just going to buy the more expensive Trojans from now (worth it)."
1,MAKES MATH ERRORS!,"I previously gave this quicken 2 stars, but now i am downgrading to 1. my balances in quicken sometimes dont match up with the ones on line and after thinking myself crazy and manually adding and readding, and inserting various ""mystery"" placeholder entries, i find that quicken actually makes math errors! if there is one thing that you do not want in a computer program (especially a financial one)and if there is one thing that even a primitive computer programmer should be able to do is write software that adds and subtracts correctly! i hope they fix this and make available the fixes on line."
2,Quicken is NOT compatible with QIF imports!,"Think real hard before you upgrade to the 2006 version. Yes, Intuit a.k.a. Quicken invented ""QIF"" (Quicken Interchange Format) but now you CANNOT Import QIF data from your financial institution. While many companies offer the ""Web Connect"" format which works fine (only a few glitches with some transactions), if your banks and credit card companies only offer QIF download format and you use this feature, then save yourself some aggravation and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Check out other financial software. Maybe after we all convert to Microsoft Money Intuit will see the error of their decisions. Why would a company remove working functionality from their product is beyond my comprehension. Quicken user since 2001. I doubt if I upgrade on the Quicken path again unless they fix this."
2,Quicken no longer supports my bank's data format?!,"It seems Intuit recently decided to stop supporting the QIF data format in order to promote uptake of the newer OFX format. Unfortunately, a significant number of financial institutions still use the QIF format (and only this format), including my company's corporate credit card.Most frustratingly, Quickens website claims that my financial institution (Citi Cards) supports OFX ... if only someone had told the Diners Club MasterCard division.Since I can't exactly change my corporate credit card, and I am not willing to manually enter each transaction, this software isn't all that useful to me.Looks like I'm going to have to use Microsoft Money."
3,Quicken Deluxe 2006,It is not much different from my 2004 version. Somehow though I have double records of some accounts. Some accounts have reappeared that were hidden. Overall it still works for my checking and other accounts. There should be some way to get rid of the double accounts without losing the other one.I'm not as pleased with the last two versions as I was with earlier ones.
2,I have come to loathe Quicken,"I have used Quicken for about 3 months, and find that it is a royal pain to work with. There are many many features, but it doesn't take long, even when setting up new accounts, that you have to hack together imperfect ways of handling all kinds of transactions. I haven't tried Money yet, but I can't believe that it's worse than this."
3,Quicken 2006 - Trap For The Unwary,"I have used Quicken 2003 since it was new and it does everything it's supposed to do. 2006 may be a good upgrade, but if you import bank account or other information with QIF files, you'll want to skip Quicken 2006. The capability is gone. There's some talk about warning about this, but I learned only when my file import failed. Back to good old Quicken 2003 for me. The problem is there's no way to learn about the new product in advance. There's a manual, but you have to install the product to see it."
4,I like it - Why all the fuss?,"I upgraded from 2003 version and I must say that I'm pleasantly surprised after reading all of the dismal reviews left by others here. The overall interface hasn't changed much aside from aesthetics which give it a more up-to-date look and feel. I really like the changes made with transaction handling which is a tabbed and collapsible area at the bottom. The new reporting and attachment features are very slick. I also have ZERO problems downloading data from any of my financial institutions (Fidelity, ING, Chase, Compass...). And about the ads, they are Intuit-related, are a single line of text in the bottom corner, and have been in every single version of this software. Not a big deal.To sum up, 2006 Deluxe is a solid upgrade that I think most users will be pleased with."
3,Going Down Hill,"I am a long time Quicken user and certainly appreciate it's ability to help keep my finances organized.Unfortunately though, over the years, I have found bugs in the program and reported them to Quicken. For years, I have been uprgading to the newest version hoping that the bugs will be fixed.Not so!The latest 2006 version, not only doesn't fix the bugs, but introduces new ones- and it runs much slower than v. 2005."
1,Wish I had not upgraded,"I got this upgrade to better track my 401k and I wish I hadn't. I've been a loyal Quicken user for almost ten years and I would discourage anyone from getting this version. The screens are way too busy, the functionality is too complicated, and the help section just leads you around in circles. I have a business degree so I understand the basics of accounting, but you'd have to be a CPA to understand this. Either that or it's just bad programming. Keep the packaging if you get it, you'll need it to return it. I know, I've tried."
4,Quicken 2006 Deluxe,"Generally very good as was my 2003 Deluxe. Not sure how to resolve conflict between my scheduled transactions and downloaded transactions. Bought 2006 because bill pay will no longer work without 2005 and a kit or 2006. The same was true of ""Update"" from the bank. I DO NOT LIKE FORCED UPGRADES! Hence the 4 stars. Was pleasantly surprised by $20 mail in rebate that I have just received."
2,Do your research on Quicken Capabilities before you buy,"Quicken is a pretty good software and may even do things better than MS Money -- which I currently own. The problem I have is that This version, and has been since Quicken 2005 -- or so I'm told by Quicken, only uses their proprietary format QIF. It doesn't use the Open Financial Exchange format (OFX) like MS Money. If ALL of your financial institutions, including those you MIGHT use, don't support QIF prepare for lots of manual entries.I decided to go back to my MS Money and get a refund for Quicken."
1,QIF imports eliminated.,Quicken wants to rule the financial software world but I think they are will do the opposite. They have eliminated QIF imports so that they can force you to use a format that almost no one supports. Stick with Quicken 2004 and you will still be able to import your transactions from your financial institution. I wish I hadn't wasted my money.
1,Be afraid! Be very afraid if you're running XP Home!,"I love Quicken. Loved it so much I bought Quicken 2006 for my new Dell Laptop. I have yet to install it successfully after much help from Intuit and Dell and I'm not the only one having issues. Quicken 2006 does not like XP Home w/ Service Pack 2. I installed it on my XP Pro w/SP2 like a dream. I installed it on my old XP Pro SP1. But on my laptop it will not go. Pretty lost right now since I have everything in Quicken, and need to use it from laptop."
1,Quicken 2006 does not run.,"I have used the various iterations of the quicken product for 10+ years. I love the product and it has served me well. BUT... this years version quite simply DOES NOT WORK on my Windows 2000 system. It will not start. Splash screen appears and it crashes out.I contacted customer support and they were unable to resolve the problem. Perviewing the support forums, version 2006 is riddled with problems. Stay away from version 2006, and use 2005 or 2004. Maybe next year's version will be better and um ... work.I have since reinstalled Quicken 2004 and run currently with NO hiccups."
2,Not Supported,You Should note that Intuit will not support this version after April 2009. Otherwise works fine if you don't need any Internet support.
2,Quicken Wants Your Personal Info (+),"I've been using Quicken products since prior to 1999. Until recently I was using Quicken 2002 and decided to upgrade. I bought a 2006 Quicken software package and discovered that starting with this edition, Quicken FORCED you to use the internet and go thru their internet access to retrieve your own data from your bank. For security reasons I did not want to use my new computer on the internet but Quicken offered no other options. One is forced to supply Quicken with personal financial information instead of using a simple file download from one's bank. I felt this was outrageous and found other means, outside of Quicken to do my banking business. I will not buy Quicken products again."
3,Better than 2004 but no QIF support,"I have been using Quicken since Quicken DOS 2.0 and most of the time upgraded to the current version when one came out. One ""upgrade"" to Quicken 2004 was so bad (I had to revert to prior version) that I stopped doing it. This version (2006) seems to be stable and does not crash all the time like 2004 did.The layout of screens improved somewhat and there are new nice views of investment accounts. I do not care much for reports browser, when a drill down or modification of options create a new page, like an Internet browser.The biggest problem for me is lack of support for QIF format. If you want to download historical transactions from Fidelity you are out of luck. Ironically if you use an old version, prior to 2004, you are fine. Typically you expect more in the new release, not less.The overall balance is somewhat neutral. Improvements are mostly cosmetic but numerous. The dropped support for QIF import is a single big flaw that comes to mind, but is a big one."
1,"Ads, bugs and time bombs, this junkware has it all","After being a loyal quicken user for twelve years, this is the last version of quicken I'll ever buy. I wish I could get my money back. I'm switching to Moneydance.Here's my beefs. The program scrolls annoying ads across the borders of my screen; no way to turn them off. Without permission, it accesses the internet and downloads new ads. It hangs my computer. I can only use it for about half an hour before I have to reset. If that's not enough, after three years, it will automatically download an ""update"" that will disable major portions of the software. The ""fix,"" according to Intuit, is to buy a new version. Check out the fine print, if you recently got new glasses.Bad news and bad software from an increasingly arrogant company. Even Microsoft doesn't intentionaly destroy their customer's software to get us to buy new versions."
1,Overpriced for what you get!,"The packaging on this salmon is better than the salmon itself and that's exactly what you pay for. This salmon isn't worth the money. The smell is horrible, it leaks everywhere and the salmon itself doesn't taste that great. What you're really getting is overpriced tuna fish!"
2,"Great company, but overcooked salmon","This is a great and attentive company (attends to your emails and concerns)however, this particular fish is somewhat dry. For King salmon it is supposed to be oily, this is not. The fish comes in a pouch more like canned tuna. It is just ok, but I would not purchase this again for the price. Very similar to Chicken of the Sea tuna."
5,A time for love,Arrived as promised. Really a great book to read. Author kept my interest throughout the whole book. Hard to stop reading. It was a fun book.
2,Not as comfortable as the original,"I love Havaianas, and have a few pairs of the original and slim. Decided I needed a bit of a lift in my shoe for long dresses. For the first couple of hours they were fine, but after a full day, and not much walking, they rubbed my foot raw. The straps on these are just not as soft and comfortable. i don't know what it is, but my foot was bleeding in two places where the straps hit them."
1,Overdone craziness,"This audio book translation of a comic is just terrible. I'm surprised I didn't get in an accident as I kept rolling my eyes as this story got worse and worse. I didn't understand the characters motivations, the lines were all cliches and the book started and ended in the middle of the story. I wish it had been a little more clearly labeled to avoid that last complaint.Anyway, I was hoping for an exciting addition to the Star Wars universe. Instead, I got two hours of pulp fiction at its worst. Maybe this is better in its comic book form, where the pictures help fill out the action and comic books stories, by nature, seem to always continue from one issue to the next. But, as an audiobook, it just wasn't very good."
3,ok,"probably the best of the tales of the jedi dark horse comics. exar kun makes this series, but the art is terrible and the story in all the TOTJ bland as a whole."
3,could be better if it was made of cotton!,"For those with sensitive skin, please be aware that this product is made of nylon and it's not 100% cotton! I bought this product for my wife. She was very happy with it in terms of supporting her back and the stomach. The only complaint is that it is made of nylon and not cotton. It started to make her itch after wearing it for more than 3 hours continuously. So if you have a sensitive skin and your skin tends to itch, just be aware! That's why I gave it a 3 star only."
1,itchy...,"If you have any problem with itchy skin over your belly, I don't recommend this! A half hour into wearing it, I was going nuts! The belly panel is like a very sheer pantyhose fabric, and the second time I wore it, it had a tear already. Just not worth the money!"
3,good product but.....,"good product, gave me the support i needed at 36 weeks pregnant,wore it to my sister's wedding,gave my dress a good fit. good leg/bum /tummy supportwould have rated higher but the over tummy part pulled the very first time i wore it and i dont have long nails!"
5,great buy,I was very pleased with this product. It smoothed out all the bumps of my body and underclothing. Perfect under clingy dresses.
2,Front panel ripped first day,"I was very excited to see that SPANX had a maternity line and bought a pair of these in black. I put them on, they felt great and was happy with the level of support. On my second trip to the ladies room I was pulling them up and the whole front panel ran like a pair of stockings. Trust me this was a fabric/deisign issue - I have short nails and was extremely careful rolling them back on.I was extremely disappointed - this is an expensive item, especially when you are pregnant and trying to manage a maternity wardrobe suitable for the office. I have no idea if there is another alternative."
3,works well but belly panel runs,This is the perfect garment to wear under dresses or smooth pants. My only complaint is that the belly panel is a little too sheer and runs/snags too easily.
1,very bad quality,At the beginning I was very happy with panties however after 2 weeks of very careful wear only hand washing them and air drying them they ripped in 3 different places. I am very disappointed as I was so careful with them. If you wash them you can't return them so I am very upset about the purchase
2,Beware of sizing,"Let me preface this by saying this is the first Spanx product I've ordered that I haven't liked. While I haven't actually worn them, I've only tried them on twice, I am disappointed in the amount of support it provides. I ordered a size B as per the sizing recommendation based on the website. The back band is baggy and sags beneath my shirt. This would be a problem if I was wearing a dress as it would show through the fabric, I have to keep pulling it up. I was hoping for a product that would provide some compression/ligament support in the upper legs, and belly support in front. This product does not do that. Again, I think it's probably a matter of getting the correct size. I have contacted the seller to ask whether it's possible to exchange for a smaller size, just beware of the size guidelines given. If you are on the fence about what size to go with and are hoping for more support, go with the smaller size!"
4,As expected,"These are the first spanx that I have ever worn and they performed as I hoped. The bump section could have a higher band but that is what you get with the one length fits all sort of option. I found that my pre-pregnancy height/weight workded for sizing. My lower legs did swell up mightily when I wore these, which might have something to do with my thighs and behind being squeezed in, but that isn't the spanx fault. It is something to watch out for. I might switch to the pantyhose for this reason."
1,Reviews overrated,"I'm on my husbands account, as I ordered these after the doctor recommending I get a support belt. I ordered several products and the reviews on the Mama Spanx products are very misleading. This is a sheer and flimsy pantyhose that does not have any supportive elements to it, smoothes out a bit, but feels tight and sticky. Plus, I have issues with yeast infections when pregnant ( I know, kinda tmi, but extremely common during pregnancy!!) and this seemed to make them happen more often. I found success with a much more superior product that focuses more on the support and smoothing elements I was looking for, plus it's worn over pants or my maternity jeans kinda like a belly band, so it's much easier to wear everyday with my clothes. They should be paying me to promote their product because I still tell all my pregnant girlfriends about it even though my son is now almost 2! ha!"
2,"Not supportive, very dissapointed.","I found that this is okay for smoothing lines in clothing just like panty hose but I did not feel ""supported"" in my tummy which was the main goal of this purchase. It almost feels as though it pulls down on my tummy making things even more uncomfortable than before I put it on."
5,Nisei Daughter,"Nesei daughter is quite an intriguing narrative based on an autobiography of a Japanese-American woman who lived in Seattle during the 1920's and 1930's.The author presents an illuminating account of the complexities surrounding being a US citizen of Japanese descent and how this affected them after the outbreak of World War II when they had to be evacuated from Seattle, isolated and kept in concentration camps without trial.The book is useful for understanding issues of identity, racism, social justice, citizenship and gender. It is an invaluable tool for understanding the history of orientals within the US and can serve as memoir for them."
4,Nisei Daughter,"I was required to read this book for My History of the American West course, and I enjoyed the book as it was a great story written by someone who experienced the internment, but after reading Strawberry Days by David A. Newiwert, I realized that Sone left out the true feelings of the War World II time period. She only briefly touches upon the racism and the hatred towards the Japanese during that time, and the injustices that they suffered. Still I did take into consideration the time period that the book was published, and the sentiments still being felt at that time. So I would highly recommend this book but I would also suggest to do any further reading of the topic to get a true feeling of the Japanese Internment."
4,A Nice Set of Ballades,"I'm not a great fan of Murray Perahia. I've never been able to quite put my finger on why, though. He seems to be sensitive to what the composer wishes and he is technically brilliant, but he (in most cases) just doesn't seem to be able to draw me in. That being said, I think this is one of his better efforts, and the sound is very good. I would rate the Ballades about equal to Earl Wild's set, but below Arrau's. Of course, nobody can touch Rubinstein on these works. I will add that the smaller works that fill out the disc are very well played. All in all a nice intro to Chopin, but you would be better off spending the ridiculously low price of about $30 and get Rubinstein's box set."
2,You get every note,"Can there be very many recordings so highly praised which evidence such a lack of spontaneity? Every note in every measure is there. Unfortunately, there's not much Chopin left. Chopin left his listeners totally rapt in a different universe. When one of his Polish pupils, a giant, played the Scherzo Op 39, a listener criticized the performance to Chopin as too powerful. Chopin replied that if he had the strength of his pupil, he would shatter the piano. Schumann called Chopin's music 'guns buried in roses'. Perahia gives us the roses, but they're scentless."
3,Nice but...,"it's easily absorb into my 2yrs old skin but it doesn't have great grade at EWG website.well this is what i got from EWG. and overall grade was moderate hazard 3 which is best grade in moderate hazard.(1-2 low hazard/3-6 moderate hazard/7-10 high hazard)Other HIGH concerns: Endocrine disruptionOther MODERATE concerns: Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), Contamination concerns, Biochemical or cellular level changesOther LOW concerns: Ecotoxicology, Data gapsit doesn't have funny smell and product doesn't make skin dry or too greasy but is this really safe?i can't answer that and i do not have intention to try another one.. because there are a lot good lotion which has lower hazard level."
4,Pretty good,The pad arrived in 24 hours and fits nicelyno need for a mouse padnice and clear so it does not take away from the finish of my deskhappy :o)
3,Stephanie Plum for Boys,"Laurence Klavan's THE SHOOTING SCRIPT is a lot of over-the-top breezy, gonzo fun. Like a Janet Evanovich novel for boys. While the plot engages and the pace brisk, my big problem with this novel was the absence of women who weren't either boinking main character Ray Milano or somehow related to him. Though I guess some readers might find this a plus rather than a minus."
5,"Fun, fun, fun",My son and daughter read this book during our family vacation. It was equally enthralling for both of them. I came back to Amazon.com to see if there were more titles by these authors. The sequel highlighted at the end of this book looks like it will be another winner for my kids.
5,Beyond Sherwood Forest blu-ray,This was an excellent movie for the whole family. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would highly recommend this movie for everyone.
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"This movie may have been passable as a throwaway TV movie but certainly shouldn't be selling for $17 on Amazon. The movie was boring, the script was bad, the filmography was mediocre, the acting was only passable, the sets were weak, the special effects were abysmal, and the costumes were unremarkable.The DVD cover looks like the best thing about this movie.Perhaps a rental if you have absolutely nothing better to do, but don't spend $17 on it or you'll kick yourself afterward."
2,Silly fun,"This SciFi Channel version of the Robin Hood tale is silly and cheesy, but fun nonetheless. My first thought while watching this movie was ""Why?"" However, I found myself stuck to the end. True blue to it's TV fantasy, B movie genre, the effects are cheesy, the dialogue is fluff and the story is utterly unbelievable. If you are looking for an evening of quality entertainment walk away, but for a mindless guilty pleasure, look no further. Shh I won't tell."
2,bad movie,This movie had a bad plot and very poor acting. You could almost know what was going to happen before it actualy did. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
4,I Love Paris (Michel Legrand),"Enjoyable, but I had hoped it would be better. Good value for the price if you are a Michel Legrand fan and/or enjoy this type of music (relaxing)."
5,Brilliant arrangemnts,"Michel LeGrand, famouse for his movie scores, orginally started as a conductor and arranger. In this, his first album, show his talents at this finest. I Love Paris paved the way for his later classic columbia albums, such as Castles in Spain, Scarlett Ribbons, The Columbia Album of Cole Porter and many others. Many feel that this album is the best representation of popular French Music. I have to agree. In the late 60's Paul Mauriat recorded a similar album that is just as enjoyable. If you want to get to know Michel LeGrand at his peak, buy this album."
1,Bad products - 25% broken,"Although aluminum package was beatiful (not torn), 25% (1 section) was completely broken. Maybe it might have been dropped or by similar reason before shipping. (wrapping for final shipping was perfect) This type of glassware has to be taken a special care of before shipping (as well as after shipping)."
2,Find Other Adv Micro Books,"The book is not so well written. Jehle and Reny's Advanced Microeconomic Theory is much better. But if you want to learn definitions in terms of sets, take a look at this book."
5,Classic Disco Of The 70s,"One of the best disco acts of the 70s. I already had this album on tape but i still prefer hearing this album on cd with highs and lows noticeably clear enough on digital transfer. Their style of music was so unique and very much different from other disco albums of the 70s, bouncy and truly danceable.I wish those producers in the business will appreciate the quality of their style and possibly release all their albums. Many fans will surely be delighted to collect their albums not just the usual compilations available in the market today.I followed their career for quite a long time and can assure you that their music will never be forgotten. I can honestly say that 70s disco music was THE BEST and can never be duplicated. Who can forget Macho Man, In The Navy, Sex Over The Phone, YMCA, etc. This album will surely remind you of the 70s, a well deserved place in your collection."
2,NOT THE ORIGINAL,Do not beleive what you have read in the reviews on here for this title. This title is NOT the original recording from the 60's. It is a live recording from 1993.
2,WHERE IS ROMANCE?,"No romance!Absolutely NOT in this book.Just chaotic confusion of Shakespear and Queen Elizabeth.The reason I write this review:I bought this book recommended by other three revieweres below and I don't want you to. The hero is always selfish, commanding, heroine ..baah, I can't even describe her.She has no spine, I think. Anyway, I want you to know this book is about Shakespear and his play, not about romance or love."
4,Very interesting,"A thorough and interesting survey of the many ways you can find fractal in nature, and many subjects usually discarded by the other textbooks I happened to read. After some years I read it, I still remember the vivid description of DLA growth."
3,Decent shoe.,"The sole is comfortable, however it is a thin shoe and the heal is pretty rigid which can cause it to dig into the achilles."
5,Teriffic read-aloud,"A dog, tethered outside in bucolic surroundings, howls and wakes an entire village. The comic antics of the townspeople and the charming watercolor vignettes of each roused family will delight both adults and children. The illustrations are richly colored and full of humorous detail. I was asked to read this again and again and again, AND I never minded."
3,Just OK,"Given the notes in this one, I really thought it might be wonderful. However, on me the jasmine and ylang-ylang are dominant. I thought it might be special but instead it merely OK. Good Life wears like a light oriental, best for spring and fall imo.Top notes - fig, jasmine and roseMiddle notes - magnolia, fig, orris root and ylang-ylang.Base notes - sandalwood, amber, pepper and vetiver."
3,Wrong Color,"When we ordered this closer, we were not made aware of the different colors. The picture showed the closer as being silver...we got brown."
4,Yale Door Closer,I really liked the convenience of shopping online with Amazon.com. When the old closer began to leak oil after I had it repaired by a local locksmith - I knew what we needed and they had it! It works great and is built for the heavy usage it will get. Thank you for making my purchase an easy one. Linda
1,Canadian steak seasoning no salt,"I originally searched for TONE'S or WEBER Canadian steak seasoning.I used these brands for years as a table seasoning in lieu of salt as Iam a heart patient and am limited in salt intake. These filled the bill!When these items could not be found or were discontinued, this product wasmost similar in their advertising, however the taste of this productis horrible by comparison to the above mentioned superior brands. I willNOT buy again or recommend!"
4,Decent stuff,"I knew it said ""steak"" in the title but I bought it for generic use as a alternative to Mrs Dash.Would I reorder it? Probably. Can't say it was my favorite, but it had it's usage, it's places."
4,Poetry of a man dying and reborn,"Imagine leaving your native land, then coming to a new land with your family. It is like death, then rebirth. Kifle Bantayehu was born in the US of Ethiopian parents. He documents the story of his family in a cycle of poems that will resonate with most people. These are not ""art"" poems: this is a saga, a legend in the oral tradition, told as we all tell our children and grandchildren the stories of our family's history and struggles. I think many people will feel some kinship with Bantayehu's simple but effective verses.""I am reborn to tell this taleOf a man, a family, a dream, from this bed of veil;"""
3,the healing conscious,The book gives an excellent example of how family members should behave among themselves. How parents could have a decicive role on the future of their children. How parents behaviours shape the upbringing of children. The book also shows how family relationships with relatives and friends impact on childrens'behaviour. In general the book is a good guide for parents children.
5,the book that makes you think,"from the first page, i knew it would be hard for me to put this book down. I was right! It is deep and insighful and filled with thoughtful observation and personal experience. great book for ur buck!"
3,I liked dorothy,"I wonder about Sutton, if she was a good actress or something, it always strange about how movies reminded me about her death"
1,Watch Barbarella or flesh gordon instead!,"I love bad trashy films and i have an affinity for space themed comedic sex romps. This is neither. Stratten keeps her clothes on- its not funny or sexy in any way and despite the occassional cool lighting and cheesy special effects that are so bad theyre good, Galaxina is a spiralling space dud not unlike a dead sattelite floating in space. Check out Flesh Gordon or Barbarella or even cherry 2000 instead."
3,A disappointing sci-fi flick.,"Dorothy R. Stratton (the R stands for Ruth) is Galaxina. She is a beautiful robot of sorts. She basically runs the spacecraft. She is electrified so she can't be touched. What isn't immediately known is her ability to adjust her ZAPPING tendencies. She also teaches herself to talk. It turns out she is pretty smart too. Outwits a real alien, learns how to kick-start a Harly Davidson, she even falls in love. Knows how she can have children (it's in the catalog). She was brutally murdered at the age of twenty."
1,Yawn,"Dorothy Stratten plays a robot who overcomes her own programming to return the love of a human crewman on her starship. Her character is lifeless, boring, stiff, and has bad posture. I kept waiting for her to do something exciting and sexy. Bad puns substituted for interesting writing. I felt no attraction to the robot at all. I was more inclined to boink a microwave oven than fall in love with her."
3,Funny movie,"This is a cult classic, stupid movie. Avery Schreiber commands the Space Police cruiser Infinity and her crew of idiots. Infinity and her crew are near the end of their seven year mission when the police chief sends them on a jouney to rescue the Blue Star from a planet of crooks. The journey will last fifty-four years total. Along the way, Sgt. Thor falls in love with the ships robot, Galaxina (Stratton). The plot is classic B-movie, the one-liners are great and Stratton looks good in her tight satin jump suit. Who could ask for more?"
3,A bit cheesy,"Well we have here a sorts of galactic adventures started in the final and first 80's.Galaxina(Dorothy R Stratten) is a female robot which leds in the Eternity Police starship.The crew including a cowboy a shaggy beared captain,a black vampire(or cousin of Mr Spock the vulcanian) and a japanese old man.They get a mission got to a remote planet to get the Blue Star(ahhh!) from a alien robot which lives in a west town style full of aliens.Of course they sent Galaxina to get the treasure.After she is captured by a band of Harley Davidson believers they rescued her and returns to the ship.The dialogue is a bit cheesy the humour and jokes are very obvius and the intents of Galaxina of talk are evident.The presence of playmate DRS at least worth the money.The sound is clear and audible,but the image clarity is poor,it seems that the transfer was done from an old vhs tape.They should make a better image quality."
3,Funny space spoof. I show my copy to everyone.,"A comedy space spoof with take offs from Alien, Star Wars and other space movies. It is far better than Spaceballs."
2,Space Babe and the Frat Boys,"Teasy, cheesy and a wee bit sleazy. If you enjoy scifi spoof movies like Space Balls and Ice Pirates you might want to give this a watching. But also realize there is good reason it is amongst the cheapies.The eye candy interest is Dorothy Stratten as Galaxina, a robot that is designed to look like a woman and ""has feelings"". A sexy woman at that. Just the sort of appliance you want serving on a Police Starship manned by low class bachelors. But don't get pulled in by the ""R"" rating and ""Playboy Playmate"" tags. Other than her poorly fitting white spandex outfit, her parts are mildly sensual at best. Things do head towards sleazy in the space bordello scenes which she isn't in, but again, not very much.Low quality? Cheesy? Cheap gags? A script that is mostly short setups and one liners? Definitely! What could be better for light mindless entertainment. The kind of movie many of us would make if we had a sexy centerfold who insisted on staying dressed and no budget..."
5,Let THE TRUTH be told so that the healing can begin,"This documentary is a matter-of-fact telling of how the descendants of both the victims, survivors, and perpetrators make peace.If you want to find out the telling of the actual incident, then you need to see History Channel's ""Investigating History: Mountain Massacre"" DVD.The problem is that the Mormon (LDS) church Prez. won't take responsibility or admit guilt for the massacre even though the murderers were all Mormons. (You see this said by the families of the survivors in the DVD. The LDS's lawyers are afraid to open the church up to lawsuits.The real solution, of course, is for the descendants of the murderers to apologize to the descendants of the victims and survivors.Then true healing can begin."
1,Ripped Off One More Time,"You will notice that Amazon does not tell you the length of this DVD. That's because it's so short probably no one would buy it. Also, they do not tell you this is a home-made DVD that is made for Region 2 so unless you have a all-regions DVD player you will have to buy one to play this program. It's sad to say that it appears Amazon is getting more and more deceptive in their descriptions or else they need help getting employees who will describe DVD's accurately. I can't believe so many DVD's they sell are actually different from what is advertised. How can one company have so many errors for so long a period unless it is part of a larger plan. To get a refund is more costly and trouble than it's worth and I've never received a refund for the many DVD's I've returned unopened that I know of. If you can, buy elsewhere."
3,WHERE ARE THE HANDS???,I ORDERED THE STURHLING WINCHESTER AUTOMATIC WATCH BECAUSE IT LOOKED AMAZING AND I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A REPLACEMENT FOR MY INVICTA SKELETON WATCH. WHEN IT ARRIVED I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE PACKAGING AND THE PRESENTATION. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL TIMEPIECE. I PUT THE WATCH ON AND WHEN I WENT TO READ THE TIME I WAS PERPLEXED. THE HANDS WERE THE SAME GOLD AS THE SKELETON WORKS. READING THE TIME WAS DIFFICULT AT BEST. I FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE CONVENIENT TO CHECK THE TIME AT A GLANCE. THEN I REMEMBERED THAT MY INVICTA HAD BLUE HANDS AND THEREFORE IT WAS A SNAP TO CHECK THE TIME. I RETURNED THE WATCH FOR THIS REASON. A SIMPLE FIX FOR THIS GORGEOUS WATCH WOULD BE TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE HANDS.
4,A few things I would change,"I have owened the Winchester now for over a month, and it is still my favorite watch. My criticism about the watch is the ""automatic"" mechanism, which does not actually work most of the time ...even if you wear it daily. I am hand-winding it each day, which is a bit of an annoyance, but tolerable. The second, which I could not live with, is the gold hands of the watch. It is virtually impossible to see the hands most of the time. I ended up sending the watch back to Stuhrling to have the hands changed to their ""only color"" which is blue (an additional 30 dollar cost, not including shipping). Otherwise, I can't wait to get the watch back, as I truely love wearing it, very classy."
1,New watch purchase,"The watch was beautiful. Unfortunately, as soon as my son opened the pig the crystal fell out. Amazon was awesome about the return."
2,Failed after 9 months,"Although this is the lovliest man's skeleton watch I have found on the market, mine lasted nine months before failing to run. The automatic wind feature never worked. I had to wind the watch daily. It ran several minutes fast per day from the day I got it. A week ago, it just stopped. Nothing appears broken or loose, but the watch will not run anymore. It has drawn many compliments, but having to rely on my cell phone for true time has been more of an inconvenience than I thought it would be. I did not buy the watch on Amazon, but from another dealer. Sturhling Original customer service has been less than responsive. Rather than spend another $150 or so (including shipping) for a replacement that has not changed and may have the same fate, I've purchased a new two-tone (gold/stainless) automatic skeleton watch by Armitron from the Kohl's online store. No transparent back crystal and not as much edge detail, but luminous hands and a better reputation than Sturhling."
5,A True Skeleton Watch,"If you are fascinated by skeleton watches like I am and collect them like I do, you will enjoy watching this mechanical beauty at work. I have had this watch for 2 years now and it has worked perfectly. If you want a good conversation starter, wear this watch. The manufacturer has an insert with instructions about setting the time properly. If the instructions aren't followed properly you can damage the internal works of this watch. That is the down side. A little extra special care must be taken but is worth it, in my opinion, because this watch is so unique and fun to wear.I am puzzled by some of the negative reviews because I haven't had any problems with this watch functioning properly. Automatic watches are for active people. I have never had to wind this watch. The leather band color did get ""discolored"" or worn a bit, but that can be easily replaced or changed. All in all this watch was a worthwhile purchase."
3,One of Cantinflas's best...but the DVD quality is vey poor,"I always liked this movie and considered it one of the best made by Cantinflas. As far as a movie goes I give it five stars. But the DVD quality is terrible (one star.) The sound and image are bad. The VHS version that I own is much much better, cleaner and clearer . The DVD version also has been cut and is missing a considerable portion of the ""wedding ceremony."""
2,"Three stars for the restoration, zero for the butchering","Be warned, this edition is cut!, almost at the end of the movie, almost five minutes of the film are out of it...The image is better than the other edition that you can buy, but don't expect a Citizen Kane restoration...The only pro about this edition is the restoration of the original opening credits (the other edition has a collage of pictures instead of it)I hope Vanguard Cinema exchange this DVD for one uncut."
4,A clasical mexican comedy,"For those who understand Spanish and want to laugh a lot, but really a lot shouldn't miss this movie. Ahi esta el Detalle joins two of the greatest mexican stars of the golden movie era of that country:Mario Moreno( Cantinflas), the unique ""mimo"" and Sara Garcia, this unforgettable actress who became the "" granny"" of Mexico. Of course, she is quite young in this movie. I can't forget either Joaquin Pardave, other incredible mexican comedian who makes a gorgeus caracterization of a jealous husband. I will resume that, in spite of this picture is very old,actually keeps its freshness as one of the finest comedies I ever saw"
4,One of the greatest comedians ever....,I love all Cantinflas movies. They make me laugh a 1000 times a minute. Ahi esta el detalle is one of Mario Morenos best movies. But I'd have to agree with some of the other reviews that the DVD version isnt that great at all. It still captures alot of the great moments but they cut out a lot of stuff.Like the wedding ceremony and little parts throughout the dvd. At first I thought my dvd was skipping.=P Maybe someday someone will remake this dvd to contian the whole film without any editing. Id get the vhs over this but its still worth having in any format.
2,"great movie, problems with edition, though","I love this film, it is one of my favorites! However this edition is cut short near the end. It also does not have the subtitles that Amazon is indicating."
2,Must See,"I gave this two stars to go along with the other two reviewers who have this version, because if it is a cut version, then that would be a tragedy. This was the first Cantinflas movie I saw, and so far no other Cantinflas movie comes close. Ahi Esta el Detalle is an excellent film."
5,Thought Provoking,"I am not a complete newbie to garden design, although my efforts have been more instinctive than educated. I own a number of garden design books, but Allen Smith's book was the most readable of all. I found myself reading and then thinking about how to apply each of the principles to my current small garden as well as one I am planning for a new house. I read every word, including the third section (which others found dull or repetitive but which I found to reinforce earlier text with additional detail).Mr. Smith's writing style is conversational and accessible to those of us who are not horticulturists, and I enjoyed his occasion introduction of classical allusions and quotations.In short, this book stimulated many new ideas and a different way of thinking about my garden. It's a nice fit for people who know something about gardens and plants but are not professionals."
4,The Album that Started it ALL,"First of all, I'm a LONG time KISS fan and own everything there is (almost) - but this is a great record because it started it all and because of the songs that are on it. ""Deuce"" ""Strutter"" ""Cold Gin"" ""Black Diamond"" ""Firheouse"" - these are all KISS classics. It's always a shame to think that this album didn't do well commerically when it cam out nor did it yield any big radio hits. The only problem I have with it (if there is one) is that in my opinion, it doesn't stand the test of time sonically. The way the songs sound - sound a bit safe, and at times they seem a bit slow. That's why ""Alive"" stands up so well - sonically it captures what the band what about. But, this record has that cool classic feel to it, and it's very clean sounding - and the boys were playing their hearts out!"
4,A lot of fun,"I read somewhere that there is actually a KISS debut album that never was released. Anyway, the self titled Kiss ended up being their debut and, although, it isn't in the category of great, it isn't in the category of bad. It's actually pretty good.The songs get a studio treatment that was prevalent in the '70's, which isn't a bad thing. It's interesting for the fan to get the studio versions of each of these early songs. The band would seriously rock these songs more live and we get those versions on Alive 1. But this 'first' album is a lot of fun."
4,Great debut from the mighty KISS!,"I love this CD, songs like ""Nothin' to Lose"" ""Deuce"" ""Black Diamond"" & the 3rd GREATEST KISS song EVER ""Strutter"" really stand out and still to this day sounds as FRESH as anything that's out there today! If you don't have this CD in your collection then what are you waiting for? GET IT NOW!"
5,Kiss Self Tiltled,"I'm not a big Kiss fan. Digging back to 70s-80s for some bands and albums I over looked or want to look into. With Kiss, I did know what to expect going into with this one. Don't expect any chugging guitars or anything too heavy. Rock and Roll/Hard Rock. Paul does some singing and Gene does also, not sure if there's a third singer in the mix. I'd stick with Paul myself. Pretty good album, may take some time, songs are actually good. They somehow have their own style. I don't think it sounds too dated either, given when it was done."
5,"Party hard, punch you in the face ROCK ,","Just the way i like it.This album is simply in one word, insane.Strutter,a Paul Stanley classic.Deuce,a Gene Simmons classic, but my favorite song on this album with out a doubt is black diamond,my favorite KISS song of all time period.Paul stanley wrote the song, but only Peter criss could sing it, they obviously knew what they were doing by having different band members sing the lead vocals on different songs.This is the best KISS album trust me.If you like classic 70's hard rock this is a must buy!"
4,Time To Pucker Up,"The self-titled debut of KISS is definitely one of the best debuts to hit the racks for any band in any genre. Opening with ""Strutter,"" flying through to ""Cold Gin"" and finishing the listener off with my personal favorite, ""Black Diamond,"" this album is a wonderful way to introduce new ears to the KISS phenomenon since almost every song on this disc is a live KISS staple. This is hard rock n' roll at its best. It's not too deep, not too intelligent, and never too quiet. It's loud, fast-paced and always one step away from losing control. That's what real rock is all about. You can tell in the way that the songs are performed that this band was having nothing but fun when they recorded this album.I highly recommend this album to anyone who's not very familiar with KISS. It set the foundation for all that was to come, from member changes, to the ""unmasking"" and all the way to the reunion and farewell tours. If you're a true fan of rock music, you need to own this disc."
5,The alblum that started it all,"This is the alblum that started the carrer of one of the greatest rock bands in history .There is not a single bad song on the entire alblum.My favorite songs are ""Strutter"",""Nothing To Lose"",""Firehouse"",""Deuce"" and ""Black Diamond"",One of my favorate songs ever by KISS .The rest of the songs are just as great except for ""Kissin' Time"" which is the only weak song on the alblum.I recommend this alblum to anyone who wants to hear a great Rock and Roll alblum from start to finnish."
3,Great Debut from the best.,Lots of classics here many of which are played even today. Good debut Hotter than Hell was even better. Fav tune Deuce
4,Essential KISS.,"KISS really kicks it on the self titled 1974 debut. Classic songs that many got to know on ALIVE!(1975), ""Strutter"", ""Deuce"", ""Black Diamond"", etc. are all here in their original studio form. There is only one song that is'nt original, ""Kissin' time"", which is also the only one that seems a little out of place. KISS also features the only instrumental song by the band, ""Love Theme"". A raw, hard sounding album which fits as the perfect intro to KISS. Great look on the album cover too!"
5,Everyone starts somewhere,"This is a very good representative song selection of material by KISS. Such a pity that that the later Double Platinum album had to redo STRUTTER, when there was so much more better material available.Anyways, the remastered version works well. And is a great snap of what KISS were like when they were KISS... even if they were coerced into putting KISSIN TIME on the album at a later stage :-)So, at least two early versions of the album exist ( with and without KISSIN TIME).Anyways, since I started with KISS at the ROCK AND ROLL OVER album, I am a bit biased. So I like this because it is KISS, but some tracks I am partial to, however, STRUTTER is not one of them."
5,Mejor debut imposible!!,"Son pocas las bandas que pueden tener un primer album como este del Kiss. Contiene canciones que tocaban hasta su ultima gira, ""Strutter"", ""Cold Gin"", ""100.000 years"", ""Firehouse"", ""Black Diamond"", ""Nothing to loose"", solo por nombrar algunas. Es un disco clásico, obligado para todos los fanáticos del Heavy Metal y de Kiss. Si no lo tienes compralo, no te arrepentiras!"
1,Kiss album,"The image shown here does not show the red sticker in the top left corner of the album. Very deceiving and I was quite disappointed. Can't take the sticker off and as I am using this album as framed art, it doesn't look as I expected. In fact, I don't care about the condition of the album, it was the cover I was needing and this image is not what I received. Probably won't use this vendor again as I would never be sure I was getting what is actually shown, unless the vendor wants to exchange the album for another one with a better cover without the ugly red sticker."
4,Brings back memories,"The only downside to ordering CD's from Amazon is occasionally you get a cracked case. Other than that, I'm glad I found this. I loved KISS when I was a kid and had all the albums (up to Unmasked). What really pushed me to get this though was the price, $5!! How can you pass that up? I'm not sure if its on this album or not, but the song Kissin' Time is a rip off of Dancing In The Streets."
5,Pure Kiss,"Loved this album!It convinced me that Kiss at one point actually came out with raw and loud 70s metal/hard rock.This is their best album from the 70s.Destroyer has nothing on this monster.Upon first listen,the first 6 songs blew me away!So before you dismiss this band for their make-up and that ""rock and roll all night"" song which everyone's heard,give this album a listen and you will be rockin' like it's the 70s!Standouts:Tracks 1 to 8!"
4,A great debut album,"This album would get 5 stars if not for Alive doing the songs real justice. KISS is a live act and the studio versions just don't make it completely. Still, this has all the KISS standards. Deuce is the best song they ever wrote. Cold Gin is a classic."
3,Pretty Good Debut Album.,"This first release from Kiss is not bad. It contains some of their best songs. ""Cold Gin"" is one of my favorite songs--just an all around fun song. ""Deuce,"" ""Strutter,"" and ""Firehouse"" are also good to listen to. The rest of the songs are okay. This debut album has some good moments."
5,Fong C.,"The messages are clearly written and presented very systematically. I used this book bought from amazon.com as the main reference in teaching adult's a class (1, 2 & 3 John) Sunday school."
5,This book is full of treasures,"This is an excellent study on 1John. As always, Warren Wiersbe expounds on the truth of the Word in practical ways that we can touch and feel. He is able to take a biblical truth and show us what it looks like in our lives. I highly reccommend this book; you won't be disappointed."
5,Great Music by a Great Artist,"As some other reviewers here have noted, John Williams has recorded this music before. I choose to evaluate the two separate recordings much the same way I evaluate pianist Glenn Goulds two recordings of Bach's Goldberg Variations- as two different portraits of music created by an artist at two different times in their life. Both versions to me are magnificent, and reflect different aspects of John Williams and his musical perspective.I love John Williams' recordings of Barrios, above all others that I have heard. I do wish that he would record additional Barrios repertoire, at least if they were pieces that he has affection for. At any rate, Williams is not just a great guitarist but at his best a great artist."
5,Enjoyable New Discovery,"I happened to discover this fine recording and performer from Christopher Parkening noting how much he likes John Williams transcriptions for guitar. So searching his recordings and enjoying the Brazialian guitar work, I ventured to try this one.Unfamiliar at the time with Barrios, what a outstanding composer for guitar. Williams is very adept at most intricate and difficult fingerings. He plays with exceptional pace, balance and passion.I especially enjoy the tapping method on Cueca. Also, the recordings of Choro de saudade and Aire de zamba are very refreshing and delightful sounds.This will enjoy much play time. Wonderful change of pace recording."
3,"Elegant, but repetative","John Williams is a fine Barrios interpreter, but in truth this CD is little more than a re-hash of previously recorded material. In fact, many of the tracks have been previously recorded by Mr Williams more than twice. It contains virtualy nothing new at all, apart from ""Medallon Antiguo"", and the much recorded by others ""Julia Florida"". In view of the fact there is a wealth of material by Barrios rarely recorded, I found the choice of material offered here dissapointing.Having said that, to those who have not previously listened to Williams other recorings of this composer, could do a lot worse than buy this CD. Williams playing contains the bouyancy, interspersed with feelings of yearning inherent in many of Barrios works.The overall recording though is less expressive on the whole than Antigoni Goni, or David Russell's renditions of Barrios. We have heard nearly all this before from John Williams."
5,Jungles of Paraguay,Fabulous John Williams on discontinued(?) cd. I had thought that this Sony recording was no longer available and am delighted to have obtained it.
2,Stank,"This is going to be a plain and simple review. If Denzel Washington wasn't in the film you never would have heard of it.A blind middle aged man that knows self defense that can soundly whip the asses of multiple threats simultaneously, and oh yeah I almost forgot, can also journey thousands of miles on foot after being shot in the stomach. Like the premise of the story but the execution of said story is full of nasty holes."
3,holy book????? i dont think so,"You get a lot of dust, but there is not much in it. once they spoked the truth, because of that book, we had and have many wars about it !!! so why bother to save and reproducing it. Let it be.about the blu ray sound and picture are good, so in that case you dont get fooled."
4,If Denzel is in it.. It should be good..,"The movie was good because Denzel Washington was in it. I am a Denzel Washington fan. The movie was okay, but is not the same without Denzel. Good plot what would happen to the world if everything comes to an end. The ending is good. They talk about a book that the bad guy really wants because with this book the bad guy could have control over the earth; really interesting. I'm pretty sure you already know what book we are talking about, which have the most influence on humans. Well, that's it pretty much; Denzel's mission is to take that book to the west to rebuild the world. Overall good movie thanks to Denzel. He should try to do roles as he did on Man on Fire; what a great movie!"
4,Faith misunderstood...,Dont worry im not going to blow anything about the movie here.It's sad that so many people cant get past the violence! Because of this they miss the point of the movie. They just dont see the story for what it is. In the end it is a beautiful story about faith at its deepest levels.How is it that I understand this and im not even a religous person?
4,Just Great,This is one of best movie I've seen in a long time. Great story line loved all the action Denzel was great and so where the others. This is something that could come to past.
4,Decent apocalyptic movie,"We watch all apocalyptic movies we can find and we liked this one enough to buy it for the collection, but our opinion of it hovered between just okay and liked. The acting was okay, the plot a little far fetched in areas, but an enjoyable watch overall. What is with the sound though? Our remote is broken and we were contantly having to get up to adjust the volume because the sound effects parts (explosions, music) would be booming, but then dialogue quiet."
4,The Book of Eli,"The beginning was a little long, but I guess I needed that to really ""get"" what had happened prior - and what was continuing to happen with the characters and their lives.The acting by Washington was, as usual, believable and intense. The plot, theme and photography all worked together. An absorbing film with a timely message."
4,surprised,"I knew that it was going to be intense; but it was much more introverted than I thought it would be.Not as action packed as the other reviews led me to believe, which was fine. It was just very deep and very dark, even though they completed the mission, to me it wasn't completed. After all that, I did enjoy it. Denzel Washington was great in it."
5,Great movie!,"We saw the movie in the theater and couldn't wait to get it on DVD!! Denzel is fabulous, as always. Gary Oldman was perfect as the evil guy. Definitely worth purchasing!"
2,Mad Max 3 + some pseudo religious stuff which does not add up to a good movie,"I am not sure whether the directors have any religious message in it. If yes, forgive me that I dont really quite catch it, but the premise that Denzel Washington apparently received a call from God to recite the whole Bible on Alcatraz Island in the end of a long travel after WWIII?. Despite the incomplete story and those not exciting action scenes, the two main characters (Washington and Oldman) are outstanding. Pardon me that I cant find anything else worth mentioning, except the killing of the cat in the beginning which I cant find any relationship of it with the main story or anything about the character of Washington/Eli at all. In short, not recommended!"
5,BIBLE,"It makes you think how important the BIBLE is and how in many places in the middle east they cannot even get caught with one in the year 2012! How precious it is...and what job we all must fullfill before death. This movie does make you contemplate it, especially if you read the BIBLE, and the end of the movie is ironic."
4,The Book,"A good addition to any post-apocalypse movie collection. The movie features action scenes spread out between sections of character and environment development. Denzel is tasked with a divinely appointed mission from the God of Israel. This movie is rated R due to scenes of violence, blood, sexual implications, and some language."
5,"Unusual, but creative movie","Denzel Washington is excellent regardless of the movie and he fits the role of Eli to a Tee. I thoroughly enjoyed the premise of the movie and anticipated the end. However, I missed it and the ending was a pleasant surprise."
4,Great movie with an amazing preformance by a great actor,"The Book of Eli is a great movie with an amazing preformance by a great actor. The movie itself I never get tired of because of the great action scenes inculding the fight scenes. The plotline is what makes the movie so watchable because he has a purpose to delieve the book to a safe place for others to enjoy the book and learn from it. It was on of Denzel's better roles and the supporting actors add to the movie and I have never grown tired of the movie over time. I reconmend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great action movie with wonderful actors and the Bible plotline was very powerful to me because of what I believe in. We have to ""walk by Faith not by Site."" So if your looking for a good movie to enjoy on a night off then pick this movie up and watch it and enjoy the message it contains. Like the book teaches us ""Do for others more then you do for yourself."""
4,Good movie,"I really liked this movie. Some of the reviews say it was really religious but for the most part it isn't, at least to me. Overall, a good movie that has enough action to satisfy"
1,"Weak, waste of time",I agree - this movie was such a waste of time. I've seen sex movies that had more plot and were far more interesting than this was. I'm sorry I wasn''t my $2.50 to rent it. If I could I'd get my money back
1,Total load of crap,"For the first ten minutes of this film ,things looked promising.Then it sank faster than the Titanic.Jesus Freak Eli ""Denzel"" wanders post apocalyptic World with the last bible, ""the other copies were destroyed just after the apocalypse by the survivors, as they thought that religion had destroyed the World. Denzel believes that if he makes it to Alcatraz island, the words of the Bible will save humanity. Hot on His heels is the evil Gary Oldman, who wants to own the bible in the belief that its words will allow Him to control the world.I'm guessing from things mentioned in the film that there must have been some war between Islam and the West or something.The film is a total load of bollocks, don't waste your time or money."
1,ELI,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY . DENZEL MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER CONTRACT TO DO THIS FILM OR NEEDED THE MONEY
1,give me a break,"Oh please walking around killing people to save a bible. This was a stupid movie. The only ones that will like it are church people. I thought it was bad writing and nothing but an up to date movie of ""Mad Max"". But with more killing. If you are looking for a lot of killing go rent ""saw"". Shame on you Denzel for agreeing to this movie."
4,Much better than I expected,"I only saw this one on the recommendation of a friend. I expected another post-apocalyptic shoot up the badguys film with no plot. Well, it had a pretty good plot and a good deal of meaning. I'm surprised the politically correct Hollywood types let this film be made. Good job."
4,Nice surprise,"In a post-apocalyptic world that movie fans have become accustomed to recently, Denzel Washington is trying to deliver the only known copy of the King James Bible to an unknown destination. Along the way he encounters the ruthless leader of a small town, played by the great Gary Oldman, who believes that if he can get his hands on the book, he will be able to expand his influence and consolidate his power. This was an interesting story, with the mystery of where the book is going and why it is heading there always on the viewer's mind. The questions are answered at the end with a surprising plot twist."
3,Shaft meets the apocalypse.,"This is passable entertainment but a more realistic portrayal of the downfall of western civilization would be The Road. The Book of Eli is Denzel Washington as super hero, sort of."
2,STOCK SCHLOCK,"This movie was even WORSE than I was afraid it would be. Inane, hackneyed, predictable & a waste of time. Sorry to see Gary Oldman waste his time & talent on this post adolescent, gum chewing mind numbing snoozer.The Hughes brothers could take lessons from the Cohen & Wachowski bros."
5,Eli,"This movie is so dark, and scarry to think of a world without the precious word of God, so much so that it's thought of as magical. The one thing it pointed out to me was the importance of God's book. And the power of God that is a part of the lives of his people. Not necessarily the way portrayed in the movie. But as God's word says ""With God all things are Possible""!"
3,Good ideas stretched to the limit,"The writers came up with an interesting premise on this film, but how much you buy into it could depend on your religious perspective. I thought it was novel and perhaps even a realistic idea for a futuristic film, but the movie starts to feel increasingly thin as it progresses.Perhaps i would have liked it more had they trimmed 10 minutes out of it."
3,Don't mess with a missionary man,"This is sort of a ""Road Warrior"" meets ""Left Behind,"" with some ""Cyborg"" thrown in. Mr. Washington is framed perfectly by the self-conscious cinematography and directing. Some would go so far as to call them clichéd but I would call them iconic. The writing is sloppy in parts* but the theme of duty, devotion and love of God powers through the rough patches. Recommended.* E.g., SPOILER ALERT how does Mr. Washington escape from his jail cell or Solara escape from the cave or survive the crash of the Road Warrior vehicle when everyone else dies; how is it that Mr. Washington has been traveling west for 30 years but never made it to San Francisco?"
3,Book of boring,"I've seen better! Denzel made the movie and if it wasn't for his action scenes, I would have fallen asleep very early. This movie starts off with 'Go Figure', in terms of guess what happened to mother earth? Don't take my word, see it for yourself."
3,Another post-apocalyptic film but with a small twist.,"Good pacing and plenty of action is marred by an all to familiar post-apocalyptic landscape. Dreary, with food and water shortages, gloomy colorless landscape, scavengers, cannibals, etc. The added twist is 'the book'. Eli has it, others want it. What is it???... see the movie, I'm not a spoiler. You may or may not appreciate the impact of the book - I thought it was weak, even silly, and helped the ending fizzle to an unsatisfying yawn. Still, others may like it and consider it profound. To each his own."
3,"Entertaining, but the pieces don't fit together","I watched this several times, so it is entertaining enough for me to watch it more than once.. after you watch this several times you see clearly that not all the pieces fit together very well. There are certainly a few things about the movie that are very shocking, and many things that aren't very believablebut if you are watching this so you can see Mila Kunis - who is just plain lovely in the movie - then you won't be dissapointed"
5,Love it!,I love this movie. I've watched it a couple of times. I would say to those who find the religious connection too much that it pays homage to the power of the written word and of the printing press as much. Watch it. I promise you will enjoy it.
4,Liked it,Ahh a journey across a post apocalyptic U.S. where hope has abandoned all remaining humanity with Denzel as a vessel of hope. Denzel can normally carry the weight of ay movie he is in an this is no exception. You would have to be blind not to enjoy this movie...ha!
2,DVD,Purchase the DVD because it had a Chinese Crested dog in it. Once I got the movie and watched it I was pleasantly surprized. Very good film. Video of the Chinese Crested lasted about 2 seconds.
1,Waste of time,"Pitiful and bogus is this post-apocalypse flop that lies sick and diseased in a ditch with it's gross twin, The Road. These movies are so extremely LAME that they have me wondering, is this going to be the trend? Given the sad state of mentality that allows for a terrorist to sit in the oval office, maybe we should expect drivel and tripe to rule the day."
1,Buy The Original instead of Blu-Ray,"This is one incredible movie and definitely a 4 star movie, but this rating is on the Blu-ray version. The Blu-Ray is crap. This disk has a special feature known as ""Maximum Movie Mode Survival Guide."" It is an excellent add to the movie if you have seen the movie and are interested in watching the making of the movie, live interviews, directors notes, and hand drawn images of costumes and set, while you are watching the main film. However, this add on is permanent to the Blu-ray and cannot be removed from the movie. If you want to watch the movie by itself, you are forced to watch the digital copy also included. Just a suggestion, but if you are a person like me who does not watch the extras but instead buys a DVD or Blu-ray specifically for the movie, by the original dvd and save yourself $10.00. You can purchase the Blu-ray in about a month or so when it will probably drop in price."
1,Pathetic!,"Few guys decided to make a movie on the cheap but charge a regular price for it. So, what do you endup with? The typical Clint Eastwood movie!Few jumps here and there, few smart lines and not much of a story. Who cares? You are paying for it!Skip...next!"
4,A good watch,"I do not like long reviews. If I wanted to read a book, I would go buy a book!With that said, 'The book of Eli' was a good movie, nothing more.I always enjoy watching Denzel and don't believe he has done enough work over theyears. He was believable (as was Gary Oldman who I was first introduced to from watching 'The Professional' as a drug crazed cop) in this movie, but I am afraid poor Mila Kunis has sadly been type cast (as has Ashton Kutcher) by the many years of being the stuck up, money grubbing, ditz on the long running 'That 70's show' on TV and was even less believable in 'Max Payne'. Don't get me wrong, I like Mila, but her style does not change and it seems as though she cannot get into the part. Kudos to her for bagging some nice acting parts though, even if, (in my opinion) she pulled both the stated movies down."
2,Trite,"A storyline that's been done dozens of times before. An enigmatic stranger has extremely violent encounters with the bad guys. Only the context within which the storyline occurs changes. This time it's in a post-apocalyptic wasteland (again not original). Eli (Denzel Washington) is headed west packing a book that someone seems to want very badly. Along the way he graphically eliminates a lot of robbers and gangsters with seemingly superhuman ease. Theme at the end may have thrilled some but I found it a weak stretch.The movie was shot nearly devoid of color presumably to convey a sense of desolation. It did but I found it irritating to watch.In the end I gave ""The Book of Eli"" two-stars because I liked Mila Kunis and thought she was pretty good. Everything else was old and tired."
5,If there were more stars this movie would get them all,Fabulous portrayal of...The WORD made flesh....I got it!Great work.This is one of those 'must haves' for your library.
2,Good Cinematography,"""Good Cinematography""And now the cons....Seriously just dreadful film. The plot made no sense; the story arc was...non-existent, the pacing was confusing, the characters were derivative & dull, and did I mention the plot was stupid? We won't even get started on the 10 pages required to recount the plot holes, inconsistencies, and illogical motivations.This is the type of movie that you would expect to see boom mics in the shot and 20 year old CGI technology effects...BUT the production value is top quality in this farce of a story.The final irony is you would expect a stronger pro or con reaction giving the religious nature of the story but even that aspect of this drama is seeping with a dull malaise.I know it is tempting if you are a apocalypse movie fan but, trust me, this is not worth your time."
1,Not very original,"Appears to be an unsanctioned remake of the superior Australian movie Freedom Deep. Why? Is Hollywood that short of ideas? The plot is a clone and many of the visuals seem to be totally lifted from Freedom Deep. Trailers for both are on youtube and can be played side by side and are virtually indistinguishable. Yet one is a piece of art with a heart, the other has Denzel. Freedom Deep's director is making a movie called The Rare Earth, I suppose these imitators will rip that off too!"
4,ELI'S COMING,"A bleak post-apocalyptic world provides the backdrop for this competent film. Well-directed by the Hughes Brothers, the movie relies on essential goodness of mankind and an effectively balanced performance by the ever reliable Denzel Washington. Also the strong support from villains Gary Oldman and Ray Stevenson; Mila Kunis and Jennifer Beals and an uncredited cameo from Malcolm McDowell.The sepia tone enhances the barren landscape and Eli's mysterious secret is well preserved. One of the better films of this genre in recent years."
2,"I finished it, but why???","1. This film isn't worth the time to write a lengthy review. Bottomline: the most incredulous of storylines but ok acting... but again, the story just doesn't make any logical sense... unless your half awake at 0300. Yea, I know Denzil Washington is in it, it has to be good; that's what I thought and that's why I viewed this film. After I watched this DVD, my thought was then ""what in the world possessed Denzil to make this film?"" Bottomline: skip it."
2,Mad Max Carries His Bible,"This is basically the worst kind of Hollywood schlock, with lots of gratuitous violence and cod-religious undertones. Presumably the script was generated from market research that said ""Americans love violence and guns and religion so let's make a movie that has all these elements. Oh yeah, and no sex except off-camera rape.""Whereas The Road was a silly story with above-average acting, this is a silly story with nothing to commend it. It's a total waste of your time, unless you have already switched off your brain."
3,My Bro Eli Brought the book down - hard!,"Man I dig these types of movies and books. Post holocaust. Too bad the long running series Deathlands can't have been made into a movie like dis.The two black directors here are solid filmmakers. Dead presidents was kickin it old school. If you havent seen that film, then you need to check it out.Although way better than Legion, Book of Eli still needed a bit more action in it. The commercials sold it like that, but it needed more. But when Denzel was slicin and dicin - it was bad to the bone!Like to have seen some mutants.But still worth seeing if you dig action movies.Eric is outtttt...."
1,...Denzel Washington only makes this heinous hell worse...,"Ingmar right before me says it all. What kind of human being could watch this grotesque, unbelievably carnivorous gore and call it entertainmnet?Anyone with eyes and a mind can see that our society will revel in even the worst garbage. Blindly this was ordered and from the cat being wantonly killed and barbequed and fed to a rat is when I SHOULD have stopped but this masterpiece of manure was continued only because Denzel Washington (in my mind) would in a while bring something positive.When my morning coffee started to come back up, the movie was put up for sale on Amazon. Shame on me for thinking that anything Washington was in would have to be redeemable.HEED MY WORDS: THIS IS NOT FOR ANYONE WITH A FAINT HEART OR AN AWARENESS OF THE VALUE OF LIFE.If all Hollywood can come up with is this crap then lets go back to looking at carvings on caves!"
1,"Boring,Boring,Boring","This movie starts very slow and stupid. The story line is so yesterday. Its been done before and much better.Lots of stars making a very bad movie.Weak ,Boring,makes you want to watch NFL game reruns."
1,not happy,this is like the fifth time this has happened. for some reason i recevied two of these items and charged twice for them. the last time i sent the item back. this time i just dont have the time to do it. please stop double billing me.
4,Denzel is awesome!,"This is a very good movie. Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman are particularly good. Denzel is riveting as always. I'm not sure why this is not a blockbuster, but I have found that blockbusters are not always the best movies I guess. This movie may be a little too ""religious"" for some, but I thought it was fabulous."
4,The Book of Eli,"Fast paced and full of action, a very grim portrayal of a post-apocalyptic world 30 years after being destroyed by nukes and survivors are split between those born before the war and those born after. The story is compelling and Denzel Washington is superb as the mysterious protagonist. I don't want to give anything away but be prepared for a surprise ending that will either make you feel joy or disappointment."
2,Do these people know math?,"Did I hear right? He walked west for 30 years? Well, let's see. The average human walking speed is 4.3 mph. That means that if you walk 1 hour per day times 5 days per week times 4 weeks per month times 12 months per year times 30 years you get: 4.3 x 5 x 4 x 12 x 30 = 30960 miles. Now, this is more that the circumference of the earth at the equator (which is 24901 miles). In other words, walking only one hour per day he will go around earth at least once considering him being able to walk on water. This is not the only mistake in this movie. For example, what happened to the water? Those clouds behind Denzel are not made out of water? You would think if there are clouds there is water and rain! I suppose Mr. Washington is getting old and therefore he must settle for mediocre movies."
2,The Book Of Eli,"A shame and a Waste of Talent pushing this ""Left Behind""-esque Protestant Propaganda,Denzel could do way better.The movie is not horrible but it is just pointless and it's been done before(MadMax),A bore."
2,Freezing,This DVD for Book Of Eli freezes a few times during playback. The reason being that the DVD has a few deep gouges on it's surface.
2,Dissappointed,"I thought that this movie would show more on the Faith side of things, but it only showed it one time during the first half of the movie and I am now returning it. Most of the first half of the movie is very brutal fighting with swords/guns and it's pretty graphic. Not something to show a kid. I was also dissappointed by Denzel Washington's performance. If you liked ""Man on Fire"", this movie has those brutal fighting scenes but takes it to the next level. The story of Man on Fire was also better than this movie. Some of the movie showed about Faith, but I felt it was just a total action movie with graphic scenes that are way too harsh for me. I thought ""Man on Fire"" was pretty bad when he cut the guys fingers off in the car, but this is like 10x worse. 2 Stars for praying at the table when they ate. :)"
5,Absolutely One of the Best Movies I have ever seen,The Book of Eli is an interesting twist on the post apocalyptic scenario. I won't give anything away but the end of this movie will leave you in absolute amazement. You really cant see it coming until you go back and watch it again after knowing how it ends.
5,Nice movie,This movie is great!! It leaves you a great message and realistic post nuclear war era...
1,Bought it on a whim,Bought this movie on a whim because a friend was always talking about how great it is.I had it on for MAYBE 30 minutes and shut it off. I've never put it in my DVD player again. I just wasn't into it!
2,Meh.,"Much as I love Denzel and Gary Oldman and Tom Waits and Malcolm McDowell (and Jennifer Beals and Mila Kunis), I simply cannot endorse this flick. It's never surprising. There is a modicum of catharsis derived from the Bible (the objective correlative of Washington's Eli character) and the notions of faith, but not enough to compensate for the rather ad-hoc and dull series of scenes. This movie is as lifeless and devoid of charm as a post apocalyptic future."
2,"ok, but not great the story never really grabs you",Never pulls you in or makes you feel anything for the characters... But a good conceptand Gary OldmanOldman is always entertaining.
3,Eh!,"I expected more, story was long and cliche'.xxxx x xx xxx xxx xxx xx hate when you have to use more words than you need to."
4,The Book of Eli (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy),A lone hero must fight his way across the wasteland of post-apocalyptic America to protect a sacred book that holds the key to saving the future of humanity.A well-made post-apocalyptic action drama with interesting ideas about the preciousness of culture and how societies might rebuild themselves. Very watchable.
3,Just another book?,"I had heard encouraging things about this movie and was curious to see how a post-apocalyptic yarn on preserving the Bible might unfold. The title ""The Book of Eli"" is a neat pun: Eli also means God. (see Matthew 27:46). Is Eli miraculously equipped to do what God has promised? (see Matthew 5:18).As TEOTWAWKI films go, it's well made and has a great look and feel. And with its impossible time frames, sequencing and martial feats, it's entertainingly fantastic. But as a preservation quest, it fails. The film labors over words and ritual and idols (talismen), but nowhere is the Lord of the Bible revealed (Jesus Christ -- ""Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."" (Acts 4:12)).Ultimately it's just another book filed between the Torah and the Koran in a library in San Francisco."
3,Mad Max meets the Bible!,This was a fairly depressing movie! It was a combination of Mad Max and what the bible teaches about Armageddon.
5,Read the 1-star reviews--then order the DVD anyway!,"A fine post-apocalypse tale with the Hughes bros, Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Jennifer Beals, etc, doing a bang-up job bringing this taut, well-made cautionary tale to the screen. I strongly suggest that anyone thinking about ordering the DVD read the 1-star reviews first, take note of their uniformly angry, bitter, vitriolic tone...then order the DVD anyway. Movies that make people on the fringe so angry they would burn all existing copies if they could, must be doing something right! If you missed this edgy, scary thriller in the theater, don't be deceived by the agenda-driven 1-star reviews. This is an excellent, thoughtful film that will stay with you and haunt you for a long, long time."
3,the book of eli,I think the concept for the movie was great BUT the dirty words could have been left OUT!
1,Returned because disk sleeve was damaged,The disk sleeve had a box cutter slash on the top back surface so I returned it. I was disappointed.
1,"Tinted lens, strange superhero powers, confusing villain","The whole film has this dark tinted lens effect that really doesn't make any sense and is pretty annoying. The hero has inexplicable super martial arts skills, and the villain somehow has a ton of followers even though he has no skill."
3,The book of Eli,Denzel is one of my favorite actors. This movie had a unique perspective but lacked substance. Entertaining with a twist at the end. Watch Training Day. The more you watch it the better it gets. I did watch this movie twice to pick up on the little things I missed the first time.
3,"Not as good as I expected, but nice addition to blu ray/DVD collection","If you're a Denzel fan like I am, then add this to your collection. Basically, the ""book of Eli"" is the Holy Bible. It was the only one that was left after the ""war"". Well, he has it and a man wants it. Get the movie to see what else happens. The plot has some holes in it, but overall, another good Denzel movie."
4,The Book Of Eli,"This movie is great, with a real twist at the end! If you're a Christian you'll love this movie!!!! Watch it very closely, the end will make you think."
2,A Boring Nightmare,"""The Book of Eli"" has many post-apocalyptical antecedents, including ""Mad Max"" and ""The Postman,"" and not surprisingly there are many similarities among these movies. The Hughes brothers' vision is far more bleak and at the same time far more limited. After a nuclear holocaust, chaos in the form of cannibalism and banditry descend upon the earth, and that's just not an issue for Eli (Denzel Washington), a ""walker"" who is ""traveling West"" in order to deliver the world's last Bible to a sanctuary. In his way is a would-be messiah (played by a Dracula-like Gary Oldman) and very bad lighting. The plot is very messy, and the post-apocalyptical world happens to be even more absurd than the world we live in now. The ending is bathetic, and really does draw on for much too long (believe it or not, it's even more of a drawn out ending than that of ""The Shawshank Redemption."" The movie also stars Denzel Washington so it's bound to be self-righteous, and this movie most certainly is."
2,"Great service, horrible movie","Amazon and their vendor did a great job, as always, but the movie had a really lame ending. Recommend the vendor and Amazon, but NOT the movie"
5,A must see.,Second time I saw it I loved it more than the first time. One of Washington's best. Perfect casting on this one.
5,Blue Ray,"They didn't have to work too hard to make it better since it was filmed in HD, but it is definately better than the HD I saw on cable. Very happy with purchase."
4,Good movie,This was a good movie that both my wife and I enjoyed. Had some good twist and turns that keep you watching. Beautifully shot.
1,"kinda weak, the wasteland scenery doesn't save it","This ""for the easily entertained"" film has:Denzel mistrusting everyone (because he has to) while looking bad-ass with sunglasses, killing verynon-charismatic bad guys every now and then.A couple of women following him around acting sympathetic towards his quest, but of course, in fear for their lives so he can occasionally protect them from harm.The gritty, barren wasteland in the background. (yay for Fallout 3)Did I mention all the boring bad guys?Take away those things and what do you have? A pretty uneventful action movie with a shallow plot and no character development at all. One star for being lifeless film, but not the very worst possible. This film could have done so much better."
5,The Book of Eli,"After watching the movie twice and doing some reseach, I now understand the son's of Eli. The movie has a good story line without going into to much details of the bible. Denzel Washington is excellent."
4,Entertaining on several levels . .,"If you perceive the presence and handiwork of someone greater than yourself in this reality, that awareness will lend an additional layer of entertainment to this high production value work.If not, you should be able to get by on the periodic carnage, homicidally quirky secondary characters, and the Japanese samurai movie-esque plot turn.P.S. - If you happen to fall into the latter of these two camps, you have bigger fish to fry than to wonder what you might missing for your entertainment dollar as a result of not being in the first group."
4,Fallout for those that don't play video games,"This is a movie that seemed aspire to being Fallout 3, it is a good or atleast decent knockoff off Fallout 3. It is incredibly similar:Post-apacoliptic settin, checkA wandering hero, checkreligious references, checka burnt wasteland, checkwater being fought over, checkBandits and raiders, checka militaristic group gathering and perserving knowledge, checkCanibals, checkTo me this is a Fallout 3 knockoff but is that really such a bad thing?"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This movie had the right idea, but left far to many unanswered questions. I was expecting a lot more based on the previews and descriptions, but I was left with a film that was not unique. Denzel Washington was amazing as usual, but sadly, overall, The Book of Eli wasn't anything special. Just another tale about the world will end one day and reveal what savage beasts we truly are."
4,good,"this was good, not his greatest work but good never the less. I would suggest it. I would suggest it"
1,Religiosity,"I guess I should have deduced from the title that this was a religious movie, but I didn't, so this review is for those who do not wish to watch a strictly Christian film. The lighting, the cinematography were great, but it really stopped there for me. Take out the Christian thread, and this movie has been made over and over and over again. Denzel Washington is good, but the plot and the dialogue were so heavy handed, the overall effect was insulting. As well, the idea that this man can kill others in the name of defending religion (a book nonetheless) is a little disturbing, but certainly not new.All in all, a good movie for those who'd like to see a playstation version of Christianity. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
1,does denzel need money for alimoneys?,this was the biggest crap I have ever seen. I thought denzel was a decent guy but this b*** is unwatchable. unbelievable that denzel is giving his good name away. even worse than tango and cash! mad max meets charlton heston.
1,Dogma perpetuated,"Low budget post apocalyptic yawn. Very disappointed considering the caliber of the main protagonist, Washington, I suppose even he is forced to take on a few ""B"" movies by contract. The gratuitous violence was expected but it wasn't done very well, with much interest or special effects. Why do they keep making movies in sepia color, I bought a 52"" 1080p and I get sepia color, I hate it. As far as the plot, it was totally unbelievable (not in a good way) followed by a ridiculous and disappointing ending; the one thing that the world really needed to get rid of ""religious dogma""Here was their one and only chance and they blew it! Go figure."
1,The (audio) book of .... Who???,"I could write a 10 page NEGATIVE view about this film, however I already wasted 2 hours of my life, that I will never get back, watching this poor excuse for a film. How does denzel has an Oscar????? His acting is mediocre at best. The movie actually had potential, but potential does not equal good.,., well I said enough about this horrible film. I do have to admit Gary Oldman gives a great performance! What was Albert Hughes thinking!!!??? Well, he wasn't!!"
1,The Book of Eli,"Christians, please do not watch this film! I am a Bible believing Christian who believes in the second coming of our Lord Jesus, and a great tribulation after the rapture of his Church, but I cannot recommend the film. A good ending is no excuse for all the F-bombs and the expletive GD in a movie that appeals to Christian audiences. It is very violent and full of offensive language. There is also much violence against women including rapes and beatings. I do know that these will be common in the end times, but we have a good imagination and expect these things to be left out of a film that is supposed to appeal to us. I shredded my copy to avoid offending anyone else.Acting: very good, movie making quality: very good, moral rating: very low. This movie is a very offensive and has few redeeming qualities."
1,Stop bundling blu-rays with dvd versions,"How many people here ever buy a program for their computer and also have to pay for the same program on 3.5"" floppy disk bundled with it? Thats right no one has it makes no sense.. Amazon staff; please stop selling blu-rays bundled with dvd's. The blu-ray only version is no where to be found on your site. When people give me gifts with the dvd bundled with it guess what happens? I throw the dvd in the garbage. What a waste of resources and money.."
1,a waste of time...,"A dum stroy of an evangelical fundamentalist, mixed with some fighting in a post-apocalyptic scenery, a waste of time and money if u ask me. I dont know anything about the DVD or its quality, but who cares if the movie is crapy."
5,Kratt Brothers Rock!,"We have always enjoyed watching the Kratt Brothers ""Be The Creature"" show on the National Geographic channel on cable TV. Although their show is geared toward children, their style transcends the age barrier easily. They are interesting and fun to watch. Their show is filled with many ""Wow""s too."
4,Love this!,"My 7-year old, who is a Kratt Brothers fanatic, loves this. It is an awesome next step from Wild Kratts!"
5,"Not Zaboomafoo, but in a lot of ways better.","We got this DVD because we were looking for Zaboomafoo for our kids 6 and 3 and this seemed like a better deal. We had no idea what to expect, but we've been pleasantly surprised most of the time. This is a little graphic for a 6 and 3 year old at times-- or I should say for us as parents. Like on the Wild dog episode my wife was not ready to see a dog regurgitate about 3 pounds of meat on camera. Nor were we ready as parents to explain why the alpha kangaroo male on the kangaroo episode was trying to mate with as many of the female kangaroos as possible.) However this is a nature video-- parents should expect some of this. It is more realistic and less sanitized (and fewer cheesy pratfalls) than an episode of Zaboomafoo and more engaging for adults. It is something we can all watch as family and enjoy."
2,National geographic-Kratt brothers,The problem with this video is that the captioning does not work even though it is shown and sold as having captioning. The set of videos was replaced and still it does not have captioning-so where is the service for people like me who are hard of hearing.
5,The Conclusion Is Here!,"In this final book of the Dragon Clan Trilogy, there are no disappointments. Ms. Chaze sustains what is now a proven trademark of excellency in plot and story development.This taut final book will continue to hold readers within the grasp of danger as the finely realized characters fight to sustain themselves against the evil that would destroy them.A must read book by breakout author Theresa Chaze who continues to weave suspenseful storylines while developing authentic characters.No fluff here! As an author in the genre I attest to the truth in Ms. Chaze's writing as she writes of Witches, evil and spells!If you want truth in fiction, Ms. Chaze is a must read!Fans of the genre will not be disappointed and will experience hours of being drawn into the reality of Witchcraft as never before depicted.Kudos, Ms. Chaze! Fine work!Cate Cavanagh, authorcatecavanagh.net"
5,A fitting tribute,"This DVD concert is a fitting tribute to Trevor Horn, a man with golden ears and an amazing songwriter. It would be enough that he composed one of the '80s greatest songs in ""Video Killed the Radio Star,"" but his production work with the likes of Yes, Seal, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, and Grace Jones and a plethora of others firmly ensures his greatness in the British pop pantheon. While the man and his family have suffered terrible personal tragedy, his fans will always be there for him. God bless you, Mr. Horn. We will always worship your work."
3,Hmmmm,"The FGTH performance kind of ruined the whole show for me; who the heck was that guy? C'mon.......the music was outstanding, but without Holly isn't not FGTH. Too bad, because up to that point it was awesome."
5,Amazing,"The show exceeded by far the expectations I had, highly recommended for nostalgic, thank you very much and sorry for my English.Trevor Horn and Friends: Slaves to Rhythm"
5,Great gift for a fan (and his girlfriend who still reads it),"I bought this book for my boyfriend and he LOVED it. It's easy to read, filled with interesting tales and a must-have for any Groucho Marx fan. I, while not a Marx Brothers fan for all my life, found myself picking up the book again and again. Very enjoyable. Very easy to digest. It was read by us both within a couple of days of his unwrapping the gift."
3,A good collection but not definitive.,"This collection of Groucho's correspondence illustrates a number of things about the man. His wit was not limited to performance, his relationships with his friends were long lasting, and he wrote a number of warm and humorous missives to his children. You get the feeling that this collection is just the tip of the iceberg and a more complete portrait of the man could be seen with a more complete collection of his letters. Until the day an unedited and complete collection is released, fans can make do with this look at some of the funniest letter writing ever to be printed for public consumption."
5,Laugh Out Loud Funny,This is one of very few books that I have read that I actually laughed out loud at. Grouch's wit comes through even in this medium. His letters back and forth with Fred Allen were just great. There is humor in here for every taste. I was even shocked by the breadth of individuals that Groucho had as pen pals: Everyone from Harry Truman to T.S. Eliot. Every letter in here has some bit of Groucho's trademark humor. I was surprised by the relative lack of correspondence in the book between Groucho and his equally famous siblings though.
4,Funny and Smart,"Groucho wasn't always a clown off the screen as the books show, but he was definitely funny, and I learned much about how he used the humor for dealing with business problems and when writing to friends. It isn't a laugh a minute, but it is thoroughly enjoyable. The short letters make it easy to read the book a little at a time."
4,Groucho Marks Letterw,"It was not a favorite. I've Woody Allen stuff and the GL's may be great for a museum but does not create the ""meat in comedy"" I was looking for."
5,Excellent,"Everything I like in a movie. Great acting, riveting storyline, and takes you away for a couple hours. I think Redford has become a better director than even actor."
3,Not Quite Realistic,"This is a documentary, not a drama. But the many scenes of reenactments of Antietam by local Civil War buffs drags this down a bit. They don't look realistic. If men were being shot at, they wouldn't look so casual or silly as do the amateurs seen throughout this film. Still, you get a decent recounting of the Civil War's bloodiest battle. The real thing was most surely vastly worse than what you see here."
2,only so-so,"It did not really tell the whole story very well . Maybe I just read too much about the battle and spent a week there , but I did'nt get much from this dvd ."
2,Disappointed,"Very dry documentary with film clips from Civil War Reenactments. The folks interviewed are obviously knowledgeable, but I was hugely disappointed in this."
1,Movie did not download,This movie did not download even though the purchase went thru and other movies that I purchased at the same time downloaded without a problem. I searched all over the Amazon website for a solution. Apparently there is none. Hopefully someone from Amazon will read this and issue a credit
1,Abe was a bad president!,"Lee 5 starsLincoln 0 starsI consider Lincoln our worst leader and not because of the slave issue. I oppose slavery in all forms.But why kill 100,000s? Eventually all countries abolished it and with zero life loss!The movie was well done but why glorify a bad guy."
5,Wisdom for the counselor,"Great Book, excellent guidelines towards being a christian counselor. It will really help u to be a good listener also"
4,Christian Counseling Manual,"The book was in excellent condition, it was purchased at a very fair price. It is an excellent book."
1,Christian Couselor's Manual,I felt this book was a total waste of time. Jay Adams has a very confusing view of sin and how it is to be dealt with.
4,excellent,"Before Kool and The Gang went commercial with radio hits like ""Celebration,"" and ""Cherish,"" they were working in jazz funk--almost an edgier Young Holt Unlimited.Good Times is a good representation of that early work, which started around 1969 with soul singles like ""Hot Buttermilk."" As the 1970s began, Kool became funkier and harder, and a lot of this sound is featured on this albumYou may not like the slick late 1970s and early 1980s Kool And The Gang work, but in tone, you are really listening to two, maybe three different bands if you trace the line from 1969 to the 1980s: soul jazz, funk jazz, and slick radio singles.Good Times is Kool at peek power, and among early 1970s funk, this band is underrated and essential ."
2,Be careful with the legs.,"Alternate Title:If you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed.This product is simply a piece of clear plastic tubing with legs, but if you catch it on sale, it may be worth it for some...The Ghost House looks ok in the tank, but it's cheaply made upon any kind of inspection. I don't really own the kinds of fish that this was made for, so I can't speak to how knife fish, etc will take to it, but my small goldfish liked playing in it and my pleco used it every once inawhile. No tears were shed, though, when one of the legs broke while I was pushing it back down into the gravel one day. It went straight into the garbage and will not be replaced."
1,Cheap,"Product is a plastic tube with hot-glued feet. Very cheap. Buy it only if you can get it for under $1, any more than that and you will be disappointed."
5,"Funny, funny, funny!",This book was very funny and the pictures were great. I liked the one of the cow wearing a tutu!
4,Very Creative...Classic Anime Styles and Humor...,"I originally saw this years ago, but just the first part. I always wanted to see more and I got my chance this year. This film is very fast-paced and loaded with action but Wild Cardz is very short. Most legitimate anime fans and even the Pokeman-loving types will find something to like in this film."
3,"Entertaining, but probably not worth the money","I believe the english subtitle translation is meant to reflectthe poor grasp of Japanese that one of the characters in the anime has(this character is portrayed as your stereotypical chinese, ala Shampoo in Ranma). Therefore the subtitles are most likely accurate in the context of the character.Anyway, onto the anime itself. Well the plot is minimal, and while the show is entertaining I'm not sure whether it's worth forking out for. It only runs for a bit under an hour and I doubt most would go back to it for a repeat viewing. Cute characters though."
2,Decent Anime.. POOR subtitles,"What do I mean by poor subtitles? If you like reading 3rd grader sentence structures like ""me no go jail"" or ""no go there.. bad bad"" then ok. But if you're like most and want real subtitles then steer WAY clear of this DVD. The subtitles are nicely timed but the sentencing is a real turn off. I couldn't even watch the video all the way through due to this.On the brighter side, if you are a dubbed watcher then by all means check this DVD out."
1,Don't waste your money!,"IMHO this was the worst anime i've seen in an awful long time! From what I could make out, four women of the kingdoms card team protects the kingdom and in this case a giant chess peice. From there, it just seemed like a bunch of fast anime scenes and ""Here we go!"" kind of monolog with lots of naughty shots. I would either save your money or rent it but don't waste it buying this."
3,"Good fun, hand it to your new platoon leader","I wish I could use this series of books on new platoon leaders. It would teach them to manage resources, be tough when they have to be and no try to be everyone's friend (and the consequences that come with that). Get the other two in the series first."
3,Some really great stories; some flat stories,"I love the mysteries from Steven Saylor and Rosemary Rowe so I thought this would be a great collection. They each have a story in this collection. Both are good, Rowe's better than Saylor's. I was also very impressed with Wallace Nichols older story; it made me want to try and find his other work. Caroline Lawrence's children's story was also interesting but I didn't think it did the period justice. In fact, maybe because I study ancient history (and just taught a college level Roman History course in the spring of 2004) I couldn't get over some of the historical problems with several of the stories in this collection. For example Michael Jecks' piece was full of very odd words that just did not fit in the context of his chosen time period and that made it very difficult for me to read. Other stories just didn't have main characters that grapped me. *shrug* Large collections are generall so-so in quality so I guess I should not have been very surprised."
4,Consistently good anthology,"This is a very good anthology, with a wide spread not only of quality authors, but of stories set in different times and places in the Classical Roman sphere of influence. I am a minor historian and was not perturbed by any glaring inaccuracies. As a reader for pleasure I was not annoyed by painstaking details or footnotes. Some ripping good mysteries, and I find myself tempted to check out certain novel series based on short stories involving their sleuths."
2,Jackass 3D looks to be ANAGLYPH 3D!,"Beware folks...nowhere on the dvd cover do you see the ""3D-Bluray"" logo, but you do see a picture of colored-plastic anaglyph 3D glasses. Beware, this probably isn't a 3d-bluray disc meant for the modern 3d-bluray experience!"
1,It NEEDS to be made in 3D BLU RAY!!!!!!!!,"It is a great movie,but this analglyph 3D format is lame sauce. Hurry up and make it in 3D BLU RAY Tremaine!"
1,lameass 3(D)?,"Why in the world would they not release a 3D Bluray version of this? Using the old school anaglyph glasses (technology over half a century old) makes absolutely no sense when the capability of Bluray 3D is rediculously better, ESPECIALLY when this movie was filmed specifically in 3D!!!??? I'm so disappointed right now I can't talk about it anymore."
2,Only DVD is 3d and you have to wear the crap glasses,The colors are distorted in 3d bit the blu ray is nice you have convert to 3d so it's not come out of the tv 3D.
2,Jackass 3D not worth the time,"First, the 3D effects are not very good. Uses Red/Blue cardboard glasses like many years ago. Glasses are uncomfortable and distortion occurs. Would have been better to just use 2D because the poor 3D adds nothing and distracts from the movie.Second, the movie was not as good as the earlier ones...or maybe they are wearing out the whole premise of doing idiotic things. Plus, at times things seemed contrived rather than authentic, like these guys have gotten older are are no longer willing to do things that are as stupid or painful. But, stupid and painful are the staple of these movies.Overall, I wouldn't waste my time with this flick."
3,Decent Movie,"The 2 main problems with this movie are that: 1. It attempts to cash in on the current 3D fad by assuming that this format will add to the quality of the movie, and 2. The jokes and stunts in this movie aren't as good as in the first 2 movies. I barely laughed at anything, both in the theater and watching it at home. It's still worth getting, but I miss the practical jokes on unsuspecting innocent people, like golf course airhorn, and the butt x ray. Maybe after 10 years, the quality was bound to go down, but I'm confident they can recapture the original humor next time."
3,"jackass # ####, Please make it stop!","I like so many of you enjoy the crazy pranks that started long ago with Jackass.. The last movie goes beyond trying to make us laugh. It is getting downright dangerous and very predictable. Needless to say if you had seen it in the theatre the 3d had to have been better. Yes I did have a laugh or two, but I found it to be more discusting than one could imagine. This is just my point of view but guys!!!! ENOUGH ALREADY! Does someone have to get killed for your craziness to stop?"
3,Used disc buyers - stripped rental warning,"The studio gives the middle finger to consumers by releasing a ""rental only"" verison of this Blu-Ray which is completely stripped of all bonus features, and only features the theatrical version of the film.If you are buying the disc used, I would assume it to be one of these stripped rental discs unless explicity stated otherwise."
4,Good Low Brow Humor,"Yes, I know its juvenile. Yes, I know its crude. But maybe in our uptight and completely PC society, that is why the antics in this movie make me laugh so hard it hurts. I'm against the Brain Fodder that is thrown at us by most entertainment outlets, but for some reason, the Jackass movies are my guilty little pleasures."
4,Well worth watching,Jackass 3-d is probably the best action comedy out on DVD so far this year. The stunts in this movie are fun to watch and the 3d is good.The problem is I wished it would have had more special features non the less if you are a jackass fanatic. It surely is the best of all the installments and t.v. episodes combined and I highly recommend it.
5,Jackass 3D,"Great movie! Loved Irving Zisman, but Gloria got really fat! Hahahaaa made her look younger, though. I liked it better without the 3D because the 3D was crummy quality. The other copy (you get 2 dics) had the best & brightest colors - it was amazing. The opening sequence was just plain fun. Only complaint was that the skits didn't mesh as well together as in the other movies. Update, saw 3.5 and it wasn't Gloria - it was a new character called, Kathy! Spike, you're a riot!"
5,If the situation calls for it..,"It's gotta be a love it or hate it thing. These guys are truly mad. I haven't seen the other ones, jackass 1 or 2.. and to be honest i never really felt much interest. but a friend of mine played it for us tonight and we were truly busting up. This is a pretty punk rock show minus the punk rock. It's ludicrous and absurd, but you have to admit that's part of its genius. I had to close my eyes or watch through my fingers in some parts it was so disgusting, but laugh i did. So I'd just say if you're in the mood or the situation for it, this can be an entertaining movie. Not sure I'm gonna go out a buy the others, but we had a good time with this movie."
5,Hilarious,"this movie was hilarious, defintely worth it. the 3D is ok, the glasses kinda suck with it, but id rather just watch the movie by itself anyways. Great buy!!"
1,This is totally misleading: JACKASS 3D,Just to highlight that bluray 3D movies collectors' brain are up there and not down in the ASS. Amazon should create a new cat solely for ACTUAL BLURAY 3D PRODUCTIONS that requires our EXPENSIVE 3D TV and GLASSES for viewing.
2,"Ordered 3D Blu-Ray, Got 3D Analglyph DVD Instead","As others have mentioned now, there was a big switch on the pre-orders for the Blu-Ray 3D version with an anaglyph 3D DVD. I got very upset the second I realized this, and I had just literally bought new batteries for my 3D glasses at home. Not once did Amazon reach out to notify me that a Blu-Ray 3D wouldn't be available, they just switched the item with no notification at all. My order confirmation and invoice very clearly say ""Blu-Ray 3D and Blu-Ray Combo"".This item is going straight back for a refund. I'll give this an extra star beyond one star just because of Amazon's customer service, but what the heck was MTV thinking by not releasing a Blu-Ray 3D version when they obviously had pre-orders for it?"
1,Where is Chris Pontius?!,"In all honesty when I bought this, I was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it. As the title for this review; Chris Pontius didn't appear as much on this movie. He was eighter just talking meanwhile someone else completed a stunt, or he was just not there. Seems like they tried to include ""Danger Ehren"" more on the stunts.. I am a big fan of Chris and to not see him included in MORE stunts was dissapointing.. And what's up with the black shorts and thong? Lame. I really loved Jackass 2, it was great! Jackass 3? Eh, not so much..Girls, if your are a big fan of Party boy, and are in it to see him running around in his thong..Heh, hate to dissapoint you, but you wont see that here. Just party boy with some mini black shorts and a yellow thong."
2,Jackass 3,"I recently purchased Jackass 3 without having seen it first. I most say that I was disappointed with the third Jackass movie. Some of the gags are rehashed from the first two movies, both of which were pretty funny, but with Jackass 3 it feels like something is missing. I thought the gags were funnier when they were done on the unspecting public like the party boy gag on the first movie. Things just don't come across as funny the third time around. Rent this one before you buy it!"
1,Dont waste your money!!!,This is NOT 3D!!!!! You get the bluray copy and a quote unquote 3D dvd that comes with b.s. red and blue old fashion paper glasses! What a joke! I preordered this crap for nothing. It was real 3D in theaters! Why not on blu-ray?!!?!?
2,"The guys are still funny, but they (and the jokes) are beginning to show their age","Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius and the rest of the beloved crew of idiots returns in this completely unnecessary third entry in the Jackass franchise. The big draw here is 3D and I must admit that the effect is often utilized quite well. Much of Jackass 3D was filmed with expensive phantom 3D cameras and the effects are stunning and a far cry from the shoddy post-conversion jobs appearing in theaters every Friday. Still, we've seen this all before and the bathroom humor and crotch hitting jokes have officially worn thin. The Jackass fellows remain likable enough, but it has been a decade now and their weariness is apparent. The film cleaned up at the box office, ensuring a sequel or two, but I can only recommended Jackass 3D for the diehards out there. 2 out of 5 stars."
1,Why would the studios do this in anaglyph?,Is this some kind of joke? Who makes anaglyph? We spend thousands to buy 3D ready tvs and they shell out this garbage.cmon guys give us a 3d bluray movie like everyone else. Stop messing about. or could we be part of on of there stunts
1,Boys who never grew up,I am so sorry I wasted my time on. I turned it off 1/2 way through. The first was maybe okay but the boys have gone overboard with idiotness. I guess this is true with most sequels of our time. This one is bordering obscene and some of the pranks are cruel. I would love to see their doctors or chiroprator bills after they experience abuse. It is abuse what they do to each other. I can see these men as boys years ago abusing animals and getting a laugh out of it. Only thing is they graduated to people and other people are paying to see it. Think twice before you buy. There are other ways to get a laugh.
2,jackass 3 Blu-ray,To all the 3D tv owners. I ordered this one on Comcast & It was In 3D just like the theater. But I'm not sure thats a good thing. In the theater I closed my eyes a few times so I did'nt puke. But at home I had them closed like almost the whole second half of the movie. I think they wanted to go for the gross out factor to accommodate the 3D. I'm glad I only ended up paying 7 bucks to rent It Instead of paying 30 bones to buy It. I think twice might be enough for me on this one. And don't forget that the one thats out now on Blu-ray Is the lame 3D dvd version.
1,Why Put human Waste in your mind?,"I saw the movie with a friend. Expecting it to be just a guilty pleasure.I wish I could say that is all it was. It's the kind of thing when I was 12 or 14 I might've thought was funny. The juvenile 'adults' who play in this movie, are pathetic excuses for grown men. I wish I could convey how bad this movie was. If you enjoy watching somebody doing a ""defecation Volcano"", then this might be for you. I'm open-minded and watch a lot of films. But this is tasteless humor. Pure rot for your mind. It's degrading to human beings in general.If you walk out of the movie, and don't feel a little less noble, I would personally examine my life. Sorry if I seem a bit over dramatic but, that's honestly how I feel about this, literally filthy, awful movie."
2,"Funny, but crappy Bluray","Don't get me wrong...I love Jackass. The only crappy thing is that the Bluray disc is NOT IN 3D! Only the dvd is in 3d, and it's the only ""blue and red"" glasses 3d. Weak!"
4,Amazing Woman...pretty well done documentary.,"This is somewhat well done, has lots of real clips of Aimee speaking which is interesting and covers a lot of the events of her life. Interesting facts and pictures/video. Check it out."
3,helpful reference book and coach,all sound thoughts that help manage relationships. realizing the difficulty on behavioral change it is helpful to use as gauge to manage progress.
5,The Power of Two,"Just glanced so far, no time to read. Christmas present for son and girlfriend planning to marry this summer.Received quickly."
2,XXXL?,"The product claims to be a ""Double filled (XXXL) fitted mattress pad."" the photo shows bands of puffy softness, but in my opinion this mattress pad is lackluster at best. The pad itself seems to boasts just enough filling to be considered padded. With a description like XXXL I expected the product to at least have as much coushioning as the average comforter. I purchased this product to be placed on a college dorm mattress. (they are basically plastic wrapped around springs and have very little, if any, padding of their own) I feel that in order to get a comfortable rest I will need to purchase an foam ""egg crate"" pad to place under this pad because this product failed to live up to my expectations of what ""XXXL"" or ""Double Filled"" mean."
5,Great stands.,I love these stands as they are clean and simple. If you are using any of the other Sanus furniture i recommend them as the cherry colors matches nicely. Only downside is i wish they was a better way to mount the speakers and the spikes on the bottom are hard to adjust just right.
4,Excellent quality stand.,"It is all the description makes it out to be. It is solid wood and very easy to assemble. Once this fits into your decor, you will not be disappointed. Note well the dimensions of the actual speaker platform and compare it to the dimensions of your speaker. This may not necessarily support the largest of bookshelf speakers."
2,I hated this book!,"I have long been a fan of Starhawk and although I wasn't crazy about the Fifth Sacred Thing (after all, it's not o.k. for the ""good guys"" to be violent, but o.k. to manipulate others to be violent on their behalf?) I really disliked this book. I think Starhawk is getting carried away with her own sense of self-importance and I was especially offended by the effete sense that the truly spiritual can easily relate to the moutntains but not the desert. Ask yourself, how much damage did the protestors do to the Earth in the context of their protest against damaging the earth"
2,Boring.......,"After reading a book of Starhawk's for the first time, ""The Fifth Sacred Thing"", I loved it so much and the characters, so I wanted more. I was very disappointed with this book, it's so boring... Although I do like the characters, but I've tried to finish the book, only to find myself returning it!"
2,Too long a walk...,"Having devoured ""The Fifth Sacred Thing"", I was eager to learn more of Maya (or any other of the major characters). This current effort however, needed a much less timid editor. There are at least 100 pages too many, and the message and story got lost repeatedly in the details. I have not finished Walking To Mercury yet; I needed a break. I did like the story, and will finish one day, but I found myself wanting to know less, not more.."
4,A beautiful tapestry of stories woven into a novel.,I really enjoyed the collage of reading Maya's current journey to try and reconnect with her sister along with the journal entries and letters from her lover and long ago boyfriend. I would have liked to see more references to magic and the time she spent in NY with Sylvia but still found the book very satisfying. I devoured it in a matter of days. I wish that there was more fiction out there that was written about modern day pagans and witches. I did like the fifth Sacred Thing (especially the Melissa) but found it a bit too sci-fi. Maybe thats why I really liked watching the transformation of Maya from a Maiden to a pre-crone. Yet still searching for truths and connectedness. I would highly recommend this book.
4,The Fabulous Musical Invalid,"An homage to the Golden Age of Broadway musicals (c. 1927-64), this analytical overview is musically astute and well-plumbed for detail, dissecting virtually every hit or should-have-been hit of the period. The pre-Golden Age is examined, too, with its froth and silliness exposed yet again. Contemporary composers and directors are skewered in contrast: the microphone destroyed singing, rock music killed the musical, librettos are dead, and no one can write lyrics any more except Sondheim. Though your hackles may rise at some points in the narrative (I do like SOME of Flaherty and Ahrens), there really are no substitutes for Gershwin, Weill, Porter, R&H, Bernstein and Larry Hart, right? Check out this passionate, professionally-crafted tome and share it with your Broadway-geek friends. Lively repartee will ensue!"
3,Another book that hates contemporary musicals,"Though there is a smattering of good information in this book, the author's misanthropic opinions will be offensive to anyone who loves contemporary musical theatre. Grant pretty much hates everything written in the last twenty-five years, hates rock and pop music, and thinks musicals should have stopped evolving during the 50s. He contends that there's only one way to create a musical, that anything that doesn't follow the Rodgers and Hammerstein model isn't really a musical, that concept musicals aren't musicals, in short, that this amazing art form should never change from what it was in the 40s and 50s.His narrow and oddly grouchy take on this most American art form will either make you angry or depressed. If it does, just remember that he's WRONG -- the American musical has never been healthier or more vigorous, in regional theatres all over America, in Canada and Europe, and occasionally when we're lucky, even on Broadway... :)"
2,Warning!,"This book, though interesting, is perhaps the most poorly written book that I have ever read. It's hard not to notice after about the 5th time that he uses the term ""or whatever.""Also, there's not much emphasis on the ""spooky,"" as it is highly factual, almost like an animated police report.Still, it is rather interesting, especially if you're in love with fabulous New Orleans."
3,Mixed Feelings,While Dos Passos has created a very different type of writing here I found the Newsreel and Camera Lens segments to be a bit dry and distracting. It's as though you were watching a compelling play or television show and just as things started getting good you had to break for a commercial. I read the entire book but had to fight the urge to skip to the story lines that concerned the fictional characters of the novel. These characters are great and the worlds they inhabit are fascinating. The book is worth reading for these segments. The stream of consciousness Camera Lens segments were okay but are weak when compared to masters of this style like Faulkner. And the Newsreels were just confusing but that is probably because I have little knowledge of this particular period of American History though it did inspire me to read up on this era.
2,Not for me,"Did not enjoy this book. Couldn't manage to get through it. In my bookclub group, only one person finished the book. She didn't seem too impressed with it either."
5,Hey there!,"""Little Sick Twist"" arrived in the mail and I am blown away by the quality of the music! Expect an order soon for the rest of the CD catalogue."
5,The greatest warrior this country ever produced.,"The video story portrayed by the man himself. 5 foot nothing, hundred and nothing, rejected by the airforce and the marines; a young Audie Murphy finally gets into the army, and became one of the greatest hero's the world has ever known. His story really is inspiring, details involving a burning tank, 100 or so Germans, and an airstrike on his own position. A great movie for the time frame it was made. A must watch for any history buff, or war movie fan."
2,Get the book,"Get the book, this one covers off on some of what he went thru but falls flat on the time he spent in combat. I remember AMC showing this movie and the host commenting that Audie Murphy went thru a lot trying to get his book on the screen. Basically, they sanitized and cleaned everything up to the point where if you were young enough, you might think war is not that bad even if you get killed. I have had a copy of the book for about 20 years and have read it about 3 times, viewing the movie once ws enough for me. It is amazing how ""all is quiet on the western front"" made much earlier when standards were even more rigid was able to pack a bigger punch, make a point and be more satisifying than this watered-down mess. Get the book, wait for the movie to come on TV."
4,Good Black and White Movie about a True War Hero,"An older movie made about one of the most decorated American combat soldier of WWII. My father loved watching it with his grandsons. It pales in comparison to modern day movies when you consider all of the technological enhancements in our movies today. Put that aside and watch if for true story of such a young and distinguished combat soldier. I was surprised that my kids were as engrossed in the story as they were, even without the flashy graphics and special effects. It was a nice way to spend some time with Grandpa and help the kids to better relate to yesteryear."
4,To Hell and Back,Very excellant movie that really describle the meaning of Audie Murphy. He was true American Hero that was no ordinary soldier. I think that it made the movie better that he was the one who was playing his own character. They played each part right away and each scene back to back. The only down fall about the movie was that I do feel that it was rushed a little. But overall a great movie and would recommend it to anyone.
3,Mostly accurate history,"Being an avid reader of military history, and knowing someone with eyewitness knowledge of Audie Murphy's wartime exploits. I'd categorize the film as being fairly true to the autobiographical book, even if a bit ""Hollywoodized"" by a theme song written for especially the film, and by the sometimes hokey acting of Murphy's supporting characters. Murphy was, indeed, a hero. A hero who saw and experienced indescribable horror while still in his late teens. His persona was forged by many months of combat, and his eyes - the eyes of a man who'd seen too much - reflected that in all his films. I recommend the film as entertainment, and also as a piece of history. The story of a man from ""The Greatest Generation"" who gave so much. Perhaps too much."
5,War movie,"This is a great war movie, made back in my youth. I grew up watching movies like this and this one is a true story and well made. Audie Murphy was always one of my heroes and he does a good job acting, too."
1,To Hell and back,"The product did not give the type format, it is widescreen and I wanted full screen. I am very disappointed that I did not get what I wanted!"
3,Invincible review,"While I had no problem whatsoever with the seller, and I did get this really fast around Christmas time, I must say that I was disappointed in the fact that this only had 2 songs on it! It was for my son for Christmas. Guess I should have read further."
5,Out of this world!!!,"Yes Ashes Ashes was superb but, this is how a band evolves!! The addition of Fox on guitar (especially live) is wonderful!! (yes I know Joey plays the guitar on one song). however, Guitar added to synthpop is a match made in heaven. I wouldn't even consider This music synthpop in the pure sense of the word. take one listen to the title track and tell me this shouldn't be played on indie rock stations across the US. I wish that once the new baby gets a little older and these guys can play out live more that they could add live drums to their act. I can see it happening!!"
4,excellent,"Maybe not quite as good as their debut, but ""When it's dark I'm five again,"" ""Kiss on the telephone"" and ""transmission"" are all excellent and very much in the same mold as the first album. I'm sure the rest will grow on me, as the songs on the debut did.Yet another band doing Depeche Mode better than Depeche Mode can these days."
3,A Determined Man,"Pearl S. Buck gives an account of her father's life beginning with family history, his childhood and education.She then follows his path to China where he served as a missionary. She speaks of his missionary dedication, his trials and the shifting politics in China.She idealizes this man who was a cold, distant father and who frequently was gone, leaving his wife and children to cope on their own."
4,Marker stains on bookbag,"I purchased this bookbag for my 6 year daughter and she loved it. The item shipped in a timely manner, however when I opened the package I noticed that there were two marker stains on the back and I was not pleased because I purchased it as NEW :(."
2,clear school backpack for light use,i really liked this back pack at first but after a couple months one strap broke off and i tied it together then the other one did the same now time to get a new better quality one:{ i think my son ran with it while books were in it and it couldnt take the weight
1,Worthless,"This was without a doubt the worst ""Self-Help"" book I have ever read. Itrambles and has no point and gets no where near anything telling you how to develop self-esteem. I will not purchase any additional items by this author."
1,A Waste Of Time,"This is a very poor, worthless audiotape on self esteem. Caroline spends a lot of time just rambling and being redundant without going anywhere. She obviously didn't put any real effort into this product. There is very little information about self esteem presented. She seems stupid. I also don't like how she mixes spirituality and mystical thinking into what is basically a topic of psychology. Psychology is supposed to be a SCIENCE, and science is based on real, hard facts and research, NOT voodoo. There is no god. I turn to psychology for help instead of religion because I refuse to believe in lies."
1,Sounds Like Lots of Random Thoughts-no Structure,"This is my first Caroline Myss CD--I am a little disappointed. She is a charismatic and interesting speaker, however, in this CD, there is little structure and she seems to go off on tangents and then never get back to the main point that she said she was going to make. There are lots of interesting anecdotes and ideas about the spiritual nature of self esteem as well as short snippets of ideas of how you are supposed to develop it, but an overall organizational structure is definately missing, which makes the CD a little difficult to appreciate. I would not recommend spending 25.00 for this CD."
1,Bunch of talk very little if any value,"I enjoy books and audio on self development. After watching Myss on Oprah recently I liked what she had to say and some of her insights.I listed to the first 40 minutes of this audio and have to say that there was not one thing of any value in those 40 minutes. How can someone speak for 40 minutes jumping all over the place like they drank a Red Bull and then sell it as an audio. Typically you could pick up an insight or two or something of value from just about any person focused on some form of personal growth, but on this CD...nothing. I should have paid more attention to the other reviews. I sent my order back for a refund."
5,"DIRECT, LIBERATING, TRANSFORMATIVE, SACRED","Never thought how self-esteem and spirituality go hand-in-hand. Can't get a hold on ""loving yourself"", you can see it in a new perspective of having a healthy, highly developed sense of self-esteem. Have had SEVERAL ""AHA!"" moments listening to it. HIT HOME for me. Caroline speaks directly to you and tells it how it is without being condescending, hurtful. She is firm but kind (which can be very difficult to do). Be blessed!"
5,Truly Helpful,"""Self Esteem"" has real potential to guide and teach anyone who is interested in improving their self esteem and potentially improving their lives generally. This should be taught to every teenager on the planet. It does require you to be very honest with yourself and even make a couple of minor adjustments to your physical life, nothing impossible though. I think this CD and with the support of prayer anyone could improve their lives. I really do wish this kind of knowledge was available in schools, maybe one day."
3,Surprisingly disappointed,"I was greatly anticipating receiving my CD and listening to this famous metaphysical woman while I drive the streets of Houston. Unfortunately, I found her voice to be somewhat monotone and boring to listen to. I also found her attitude to be somewhat condescending. I did hear something new which is that our generation is the first that can truly create their own realities. I've haven't even been interested in finishing the last CD of the 4 CD set. I had read her first book and was impressed with the content. I realized I was looking for someone as energized and entertaining as Lynn Grabhorn's CD version of Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting. Caroline isn't. I realize that not everything out there is for everyone and this audio book just doesn't work for me."
1,Boring,This book is very boring and my daughter did not like it at all!The seller though was very quick and delivered the book in the condition promised.
4,yes return of the gangster,"yeah while you all are riding the south the best rap music is still being produced in the west check this good stuff out hyphy-crunk, g funk all in one."
3,Pretty Good at times,"Lionel Richie is a very talented Artist.I consider him a Genius.he was BabyFace before Babyface.in fact Babyface co- writes the best song Ordinary Girl.I also dug Lovers at first sight.The Music&the Arrangements work well here.but as talented as he is he doesn't need so many outside Producers.and it costs him on some of the material.Lionel Richie is still a Great Songwriter,Musician,Vocalist&Producer."
2,Keep dreaming,"We live in a corporatocracy, they make the rules, consumers get shafted. The books gets a couple of stars, since I got a few good chuckles.Every time you get the short end of the stick from your bank, insurance company or cell phone provider, address it with a consumer protection group, but don't go at it alone, and don't follow the advice in this book."
1,Buyer Beware!,"""Out of Business,"" like other Loompanics books, comes with a disclaimer. Essentially, it says: ""For entertainment purposes only."" Many of the suggestions are clearly illegal--so much so that I eventually tossed the book into the trash."
5,A great history of the Church,"This is a great book for anyone interested in Church history and you don't have to be a student to enjoy it. After watching the movie ""Luther"" I was inspired to learn more about the history of the Church. I have been out of college for years and I find this book very interesting and easy to read. And I'm not even a history buff!. It is definatly not dry and boring like the ""history"" books I remember.Plus, what a great price for such an awesome book."
2,book condition,"After I used this book a few weeks, it fell apart. I managed to glue it back together, but now I have to carefully separate each page at the bottom. I like the content, though."
5,Left Leaning Hoosier- Thank You for being a Hysterical Moron,any leftish baffon who writes comments like yours proves that i need to read the book. i look forward to a terrific read.
4,How to Connect the Dots,Excellent non partisan narrative that takes you from an assasination plot in 1990 through the events of 9/11 and shows you how to connect the dots between the numerous events in between.Many in our law enforcement and government were aware of the connections but were unable to convince the bureaucracy to take action. Decades of relative peace changed the makeup of the organizations tasked to protect us. Their focus shifted from those who would harm us to those who would challenge their budgets and power.Essential reading to understand how large organizations can miss the obvious. A great primer on Osama and the Islamist threat.
5,Excellent Read. Factual.,"This is a must read if you want to come out of the ""media 20 second sound bites!""Factual information about the beginnings of radical Islamic terrorism and how it lead to 9/11.Well writen, interesting, a page burner. Highly recommended."
4,Good but not great.,"For starters, a worthwhile book of non fiction ought to have an index and this one doesn't.There isn't all that much here that hasn't been written elsewhere but it is important for all of us to understand why 9-11 happened -- and why alas it could happen again.A reviewer above suggests that the government hire John Miller. When you finish this book you have to ask yourself why many, many of our government employees have not been fired.The FBI would be better staffed by former NYC cops. They usually get the job done but if they mess up they go on trial.And one wonders why the former mayor of New York hasn't been given a significant job in Washington where his help is obviously needed."
2,"Cheesy, OK","I bought this book after hearing Miller's excellent interview on Fresh Air. The book is a disappointment. It's told in a breathless style, and yet the book ends up being a dry collection of facts with no analysis or interpretation. Miller has an obnoxious thing about writing in the first person, placing himself in the story. The book desperately needs an index. It is a useful general retelling of a bunch of things that happened, but it's not a very good book."
4,"A solid, telling account of terror","After watching a John Miller interview on television, I felt compelled to read this book. I have done so twice. From the vivid, behind the scenes look at 9-11, to the chilling, first hand description of bin Laden, this book had me glued to its pages from the start. Miller's privvy information about the CIA and FBI as well as the details of the terror cells make for a shocking stroyline. The fact that this is a non fiction account makes the message Miller is sending even more chilling. Lets face it, America, we are war and our guard cannot be let down."
5,Thought provoking and scary as hell,"I picked it up, began reading, and could not put it down until finished. I recommend this book as a must read for every American, although I'm not sure every American could handle it.On second thought, as terrorism is global, and in order to better understand the mindset of Al Qaeda, this book should be read by everyone on the planet."
1,No ZERO stars option?,"Does anyone even care that the ""Author"" John Miller, formerly of ABC's 20/20 and then the head of counterterrorism for the LAPD, is currently the Assistant Director of Public Affairs for the FBI in the BUSH regime...I mean...Administration.This book is Propaganda. Period."
5,Brillant book but hard to get!,This is a great book to teach young children mathematics using an abacus. What better way is there to learn math than through hands on experience?I only wish it was easier to obtain. I checked out a copy through interlibrary loan for a month and I've tried to order it but I have failed to find a copy. I wish the publisher would reprint it.
1,My brain hurts,"I am a first time user. I did consider myself to be moderately intelligent too but WOW I am lost! I was hoping to use this to get my finances in order but it will take me less time and headache to do it by hand. If you don't like data entry, don't get this product."
1,Worest ever Quicken Home & Business,"I have been using Quicken H&B; version since version 98. In general, I have been a happy camper. Last month, I got a warning from inside my 2003 version that the all on-line downloading feature would be discontinued in April if I don't upgrade (they call it ""retail"" or something like that). So I bought the 2006 version without much research and hesitation judged by the past upgrade experience. Boy, what a mistake! First, I cannot import the qif data from my credit union and bank any more. Then I got an error saying the data downloaded from one of my credit card companies was saved in a account no longer existing in my registry, what's going on? Then there are data problems with my investing accounts. I basically spent 5 hours ""fixing"" the data. This is getting ridiculous.If you are upgrading, my suggestion to you is to do thorough research first. If you are start from scratch, forget it, look for something else."
1,Terrible Terrible,1. EXTREMELY confusing to use2. Doesn't download data from banks/financial institutions as it is supposed to so you manually have to enter your checkbook/credit card bills/investment information. This takes so much time it is not worth using the program.Sorry i bought it.
1,Hard to understand.,"The original 30 minutes I devoted to setting up with info was the easy part. This program is tough to learn or understand. I have no problem with Photo Shop, Flash or Quick Books Pro but this is crazy. I'll try something else."
1,I would not recommend this product,"I bought this software to be able to download my financial information like checking, visa, etc. Then I found out that my financial instutions are not subscribers to quicken, but do allow downloading in the qif,ofx, and cma formats... You would think that with ofx being there I would be able to import this into the quicken software but I was not able to... quicken only allows its version of ofx to import into checking, savings, visa, etc. and as far as qif files it says that it can be imported, but here again not into checking, savings, visa, etc...I think that buyer are better off buying something else..."
1,WARNING - Read before you buy Quicken 2006,"According to support at Intuit, Quicken 2006 is NOT compatible with a system running Windows XP SP2. This is a standard configuration for most systems running XP and was released prior to Quicken 2006. From a security perspective, this is now considered a baseline by most users.Prior to purchase, you may want to read the posts in the Quicken Forums. You can access them at:www.quickenforums.comI did not attempt to install the program. Quicken recommends uninstalling SP2 and then re-installing, and I believe they have some other fixes. While these might work, this type of workaround was not acceptable to me given the broad support and relative stability of XP SP2. I sent it back for a refund.Proceed at your own risk."
1,This program Sucks--don't buy it!,"I recently purchased this program and Intuit has disabled so many features. I can no longer use quicken with half of my banks. Apparently there is some type of extortion attempt by quicken to get all our banks to pay them ridiculous fees. In the mean time, all my banks still use the .qif format, which is disabled in this version of the program. Despite that fact, quicken makes users use the ofx format...which none of my banks support.Really, Intuit should be totally ashamed of themselves. I am so dissaointed with them as a company!"
1,Warning: Lack of QIF Support should be Known,"with the lack of .QIF support, this version of Quicken is a shell of the prior versions. Not all banks will pay the big bucks for Quicken's new format charges. Buy an older version instead of this."
1,In Hungary and Romania this Book was Completely Useless,This is NOT the phrase book that you want to buy for your trip. The best thing that can be said about it is that it is compact and fits into a pocket or small bag easily. The layout of the book is its biggest problem. The people at Lonely Planet need to go back and try to use it themselves. The sections on food are incredibly limited and gives only a few of the dishes that appears on most menus. Take my advice -- save your money and carry a book that has a little more substance even if it doesn't fit in your front pocket.
4,The book is very useful and it has six Languages in one book,The Phrasebook is very comprehensive and easy to use. For anyone traveling to Eastern Europe it is a must. It includes common phrases and small talk with pronunciations and how it is written. I would recommend this book and other books from Lonely Planet Languge kits.
3,"Not swinging, but pretty funky","An unexpected departure in style, to rock, but he can afford it. I took one look at the leather jacket and the album's title and thought, ""His (new) wife did this to him!"". BUT, it quickly grew on me the more I listened. The title track, ""Blessed be the One"", ""Honestly Now"", ""The Big Parade"", and ""Booker"" are serious highlights. A big fan of his swing, but I DO recommend ""She"" if you like Harry Connick, jr."
3,Not for the big band fans,"I am a big Harry Connick Jnr fan and when I first listened to this record I must say that I was very disappointed. I love his big band style and found that this record had none of that. After listening to it a few more times (I even went to the concert) I became used to this new style of his and even liked a few of the songs, however, I still prefer 30 times more any of his previous works."
1,Lousy muzak!!!,"This is not typial Harry connick, Jr., this is awful music, Connick should stick to jazz if he wants people to take him seriously as an artist. Try ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and ""20,"" to hear Connick at his best, but stay away from this."
1,more closer to Bolten than Sinatra,i never did figure out what Connick was trying to do and i don't think he did either.this is a very soulless album period.it doesn't groove or anything.you think Bolten lite before Frank Smooth on this disc.
4,"""Toddler Guide Bible""","I'm expecting twins this fall & although the information in this book will serve me well in a couple of years, it's less directed for pre-toddler stroller activities. This book is great for when your children are approximately 1 - 2 years old. I will use this book as my ""Toddler Guide Bible"" when they are a bit older."
5,Highly Recommended,"I first heard Maria Rita on the radio during my last trip to Brazil, and my initial reaction was to ask my friend, ""Is that Elis Regina"". After further listening, it became apparent that Maria has her own voice in music, but one thing that she has in common with her mother is that she sings with soul. I came back to the states with the cd as a souvenier, and it has been one of my favorite albums ever since. People probably think I'm crazy, because I can't help but to crank the car stereo and sing along to every word with Maria Rita.Maria is fantastic, and her band compliments her so well. I really like the acoustic bass, the piano player in the band is extremely tasteful. I would recommend this album to anyone."
5,"Oh my, oh my","When I heard Elis daughter was about to release a cd I was thinking ""what's the big deal? It's just another female singer anyways"". Oh my,oh my was I ever wrong! Maria Rita is adorable, so down to earth and she gives me the feeling she's singing directly to each one of us like a very good friend that lives just next door. Very intimate. Maria Rita is the big deal right now: her voice is great, the music selection is great and hope she releases another one soon. Gotta love this MPB style."
3,"Beautiful voice, but what big shoes to fill...","I wonder how I would feel, listening to this album, if I'd never heard Elis Regina. It's true, the timbre of Maria's voice is almost identical to her mother's, and she demonstrates the same versatility of genre (bossa, jazz, pop, songs in Spanish, etc.). However, for me, the similarities stop there. Elis's creativity of phrasing and sheer raw passion don't find their way into her daughter's interpretations; Elis was one of a kind. But if you're looking for some pleasant, soothing vocals and great production values, you will find them in this album."
3,Maria Rita's answer to momma,"Maria Rita,with her amazing range delivers classics of Brazilian Popular Music such as AGORA SO FALTA VOCE in a way her mother Elis Regina would have admired and even envied.She even ventures into singing a Cuban classic TRES GARDENIAS with utmost gusto.However,I find the attempt to make the album so palatable to non Brazilian audiences and specific the American marketrobs the project of originality.Let us hope and pray her second solo album sticks more to her roots."
2,"It's a interesting album, but nothing really new.","She has a incredible voice, just like her mother's voice. Sometimes, when one knows her mother's voice, it's kind of disturbing, because it reminds always the great singer Elis Regina. A very nice and careful work of edition, with some, or most of all good are good songs. I felt two problems in the album. First of all is the fact that all the good songs, in this CD, come from others great brazilian compousers like Milton Nascimento and Lenine, and I think a musician needs a little bit of personalitty. And she does almost the same as Bebel Gilberto. Ok, they are nice, but we need differents songs, interpretations. If one listen to Bebel and just after put a CD of Maria Rita, I'm afraid he'll say `Hey, they have good singers in Brazil, but they do the same`. For me music is a evolution.Anyway, beside all of that, I think it worths to be in your collection. I'm a little exigent sometimes."
5,Great approach to Photoshop Elements 4,"While the Elements 4 manual isn't exactly missing, it is no where near as complete as this one, which covers every feature in great detail. This book belongs on the shelf of every digital photographer who is using Elements."
5,Photoshop Elements 5: The Missing Manual,"I am wrapt in this book. It was purchased after excellent reviews from various Internet sites and more than lived up to its reputation. It is easy to follow, even for those feeling their way with photgraphic manipulation. The book REALLY should have been included in the box.The product was received rapidly and far cheaper than I could have purchased it here in Australia (Amazon please delete this if not appropriate)"
3,"Good information, but needs more step by step instructions.",Lots of information but some of it assumes you already know how to use it. Can get to what you want to do with some digging.
5,Photoshop Elements 5 The Missing Manual,Excellent book for learning the basics of Photoshop Elements 5. Well organized and easy to follow.
3,"Helpful, but tutorials seem to work better for me!","Hello,I am pleased this book is available. I have learned several tips! I do find tutorials much more helpful for me. I like having this book as a reference. It is much better than using the Adobe help section.Good luck in learning Photoshop Elements. I guess you know that the new version 6 is available now."
3,Good addition to the program,"This book has tons of information on Photoshop Elements and to use the program but it mostly focuses on photo editing. There really is not much about scrapbooking or anything else. The tutorials are easy to understand. If you want to edit pictures this might be the book for you, but if like me you want to scrapbook or make cards, you can skip it."
4,Photoshop Elements 5---The Missing Manual,This book is the most complete manual on a very useful program. I have yet to encounter a question this book does not fully answer.
5,The Missing Manual for Photoshop Elements 5.0,"I purchased Photoshop Elements 5.0 several years ago and have used it on and off for various projects. Up until recently, I was able to fumble through using intuition and the online instructions. However, recently, I needed to make changes to the images on a picture and try as I might, I couldn't get it to work. That's when I started looking for a better reference. The Missing Manual series of books seemed to be the best fit and the price was right so I purchased it. I wasn't disappointed. While I've started to read the entire book, I was able to go directly to the chapter I needed, find the information I was looking for and make the changes to my picture. Not only that, but it took less time than I had spent experimenting on my own!"
5,I should have bought this sooner,"I've struggled with Photoshop Elements 4 for several years, to the point of rarely using it. By accident I found out about the ""Missing Manual"" series. It has been a huge help. I'm finally getting the hang of the program. May even get the latest Elements version, which is on sale at Costco."
2,disappointed,"The book is well written,with a lot of information, however I am very disappointed as it is not a step by step tutorial, as I believed it would be. Yes, there are downloadable files/photos, but there is no step by step instruction to go with the photos throughout the chapters.If you are not looking for a tutorially written text, and just want dry information on how everything works in Elements, then you will be happy with this nicely formatted book."
5,Photoshop Elements 5: The Missing Manual,"The Missing Manual books have been an excellent learning tool that I discovered while using Photoshop Elements 3, though I must deny ever having read one cover to cover. Every tool and feature that I have had occasion to use has been at least described in these books, and there are many recommendations about how and when to use the tools that constitute additional value in the books. One addition that I keep hoping to see is an expanded discussion of blending modes for layers. This is not an easy subject and could expand the book by several pages. It might not be useful to beginners, but could be quite valuable to those with more experience who really want to understand the mechanics of the digital editing process."
4,Photoshop Elements 5--Very Good!,"This is a great reference. However, I was searching for a tutorial that would explain how to do everything in easy-to-understand steps that could be purchased for the classroom. I am now writing that tutorial."
4,photoshop element 4 the missing manual,Very imformatif easy to fallow. I love it and was hightly recommended by our computer club digital camera SIG (special interet group)
3,This book is not for newbies to Photoshop Elements 5,"This book is well written and very inclusive of needed information, however, I am new to Elements 5 and it is more than I can handle at this time. It would have been nice for the author to have started from the easiest to the hardest information, but I find she is forever jumping around and forever sending me to other pages to understand the section I am now reading?????When trying to locate a task I want to do on Elements, I can never find a reference for it in the index.I would very much recommend this book to anyone who has had experience with other editions of elements, but not for those of us just starting out. I will keep this book as a great resource for future reference, but I think I need to purchase another book that can dummy this info down for me. LOL. Hummmmm, and here I thought I was a fairly intelligent person??? Surprise!!!!"
2,confusing,"I am a new Elements user, therefore this book is not a good choice. Although it is loaded with information, the how to's are extremely confusing and not very clear. In my opinion it skips around to much. In one chapter you are learning layers and the next chapter you are retouching photos. It does have good suggestions for further information on the web, which I have gone to and has been helpful."
4,"Like it, but.....","I like the book, but currently have a library copy for my reference. I have only one negative comment. When the author starts to describe an action or step, suddenly she will veer off on a tangent, leaving me wondering where the rest of the text is ....oh, there it is, 2-3 paragraphs later. She really wants you to know all she does about Elements. I will be purchasing my own copy shortly regardless as I do think it is probably the best on the subject"
3,WAY TOO MUCH INFORMATION FOR A BEGINNER!,"Hey Susan-I feel your pain!! But don't remove Elements from your computer!! I felt the same way about this book, and attempted to read it cover to cover before I decided to try some of the examples. I too think this book is too complicated for someone who has not learned all the tools. Although, you can refer to it after you have began to explore a little on your own in Elements. You should try the ""Elements 5 Restoration and Retouching Book"" I think you may get more from it - read my review."
4,Very helpful manual,The manual is essentially great for beginners and advanced users. Probably a little bit more illustrations would have inspired me to rate it with five stars.
4,reveiw of basic clinical neuroscience,the book is written a clear language. key concepts are put well together for easy understanding.I will recommad this book for basic concept.
5,"Quick delivery, book in good condition","I was very pleased with how quickley I recieved my book. Even though it was used, it looks new."
3,Not as good as the Apple Original Equipment one,Doesn't aways work correctly. By plugging and unplugging will tend to work OK.
2,Completely Unnecessary ...,"I've said this a hundred times but it never gets any less true, I'll never understand the thought process behind a shot-by-shot remake of any classic film (see also: Psycho). If Hollywood is so insistant about trotting these reissues out, then for the love of God, remake a BAD movie.The short version of this review is that if you've seen the original (a CLASSIC, by the way) there's no reason on earth to watch this. If you haven't caught the original yet, then go watch that. The '06 version, at its core, is a nothing more then a pale carbon copy of it's source material that tries to mask its (many) shortcomings by turning the sound and effects up to eleven. It has nothing even remotely new, inventive, or interesting to offer."
5,Very Good Remake,"I really liked this remake, it as good as the original, I do not why some are trashing this movie, but I thought it was great, no offense to the people that hate this movie, but I disagree with them, I agree with the ones who enjoyed this remake,it was very very good, , I had fun watching it,"
3,"JOHN MOORE, OPUS 3","*** 2006. Directed by Irish born director John Moore and based on the same David Seltzer screenplay used for Richard Donner'sThe Omen (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)in 1976. The American ambassador in London, without knowing it, is bringing up the son of you know whom. Good remake but what for and, most of all, for whom ? Already forgotten."
3,So So,"I was very excited when I heard about the remake. The first Omen was great, and I wanted to see what new slant they would put on the movie for modern times. Sadly, this is basically a scene by scene remake. Aside from updated special effects and gore, there is nothing new in this movie. I don't know why they even bothered."
2,No point remake.,"I'm not sure what the point of this remake is - other than to cash in on 6/62006. There is no point of remaking scene for scene a classic movie, if almost all of those schenese are going to be substandard when compared to the original. Atleast give us a creative re-interpretation to give a different perspective.Other than the opening scene which is not in the original movie, the rest of the movie is quite mediocre. The worst of it is the Damien character and his forced ""evil"" look - how shallow -in the original the boy is portrayed as completely normal whereas in the remake Damien seems totally self aware of his evilness"".I liked the ambiguity of the original.Beautifully filmed...although the use of the ""symbolic"" red through seems a bit cheesy."
2,Categorically inferior to the 1976 original in every conceivable way.,"The remake of the 1976 classic ""The Omen"" is categorically inferior in every conceivable way to the original. Perhaps the most glaring discrepancy is with the acting. In particular, Gregory Peck and Lee Remick were outstanding in their respective roles as Mr. and Mrs. Robert Thorn...you simply do not have this caliber of acting in the remake. For all intents and purposes, the remake of ""The Omen"" fails to stack up to the original. In fact, the remake almost follows the original movie in every way with a few minor deviations and superfluous additions, but the problem is that the original did it perfectly the first time around so there was no way to improve upon the original. Still, it's a great story and is probably worth viewing if you have any interest in the subject matter. However, with that being said, I highly recommend the original over this inferior remake."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This remake of the 1976 classic is a complete failure.Why did TwentiethCentury-Fox even bother?David Seltzer's new script is dull and stupid.John Moore's ""direction"" is nonexistent.There is not one scary or suspenseful moment in the entire film.It even looks cheap and flat.And most of the cast is horrible.Liev Schreiber is flat,and Julia Stiles is bland.Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is a bore.The star is for a surprisingly good Mia Farrow and Marco Beltrami's creepy score.Skip this garbage and get the original instead."
2,Not Bad....Just Kind of Pointless,"I wasn't expecting much from the ""The Omen"", after the recent onslaught of Hollywood horror re-treads like ""The Fog"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"", I had my expectations set kind of low. To be honest ""The Omen"" isn't bad. They have updated the story so that we now get references to 9/11, Hurricane Katrina etc. But overall the story is exactly the same as the 1970's version. And while that can be considered a good thing to some, it ultimately makes the new ""Omen"" worthless. This movie has already been done, and done well. There are some good parts to the remake, like Mia Farrow's character Mrs. Baylock, the decapitation scene was cool, but overall there really wasn't much worth watching this movie for over the original."
1,I prefer the original,It does not do a good job of trying to walk that fine line between plowing its own path while still trying to keep important elements of the original film. Nothing new here
1,Ahhhhhh!!!! The Pain the Torture!!! GOUGE OUT MY EYES!!!!,"Thank God I watched this at home on demand. Basically terrible acting and a terrible remake it was overall cheesy! Julia Stiles and Mia Farrows acting careers are officially over. And one of the most cheesiest parts of the film was when Ms.Baylock was at first stabbed and then in this movie she GETS HIT BY A CAR, THEN SHE DIES!! COME ON!!! How cheesy and cliched is that. I'm shocked that this movie got 3 to 5 star reviews. It could be studio people writing the good reviews or it could be Julia Stiles and Mia Farrow in disguise writing these good reviews. Hollywood heres a thought that me and lots of people want to share with you, if a movie is good just leave it alone don't remake it. Just a thought."
1,Son of a jackal! Why?,"When you remake a film, you should at least try to make a slightly different film and, if possible, make a better film. This is NOT what happened here. The filmmakers of the Omen (remake) took the 1976 version almost word for word, scene for scene, and added cell phones, 9/11 footage, slightly more grisly deaths, strange dream sequences, bad actors, and a lackluster soundtrack and released it to the viewing public expecting us to embrace it as a timely update to the original. The good news: this movie made a lot of money on it's opening week. The bad news: it's just a bad movie and there's not much in it that isn't in the original, only the original has better acting and the awesome Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack."
4,i must wonder,"i enjoyed this film. it was honestly very likeable (and the opening day gimmick of 6-6-06 was just freakin' cool too!) but other than that i cannot figure any reason to remake this.It was wonderfully made and i am sure the crew will make some great flicks in the future, but what of THIS one?it's almost exactly the same as the original. There are a few new things, a few changed bits, overall it even seemed that the camera shots were the same for the most part. Now, if it were a different take on the original everyone would be ragging on it for straying from the theme of the original, but i think the almost picture perfect remake was the problem for most.in the end; great film. Loads of fun."
2,SLEEK BUT SILLY,"I was looking forward to the insanely fun idea of re-making The Omen for a modern audience, despite the lingering power of the original, which still makes me shudder. The clever casting of Mia Farrow notwithstanding, this remake has the same expensive sleek look as the original, and is almost word for word the same screenplay. What it lacks is the gravity and terror of the original; it's so much the same that it is ultimately pointless. And even though Gregory Peck and Lee Remick were too old in the original, their stature made the whole movie feel much more important than it had any right to be. This exercise is more like the recent re-do of PSYCHO - glossy, interesting in paper, but hollow. And definitely not scary."
2,The Omen. Remake,"My personal bias perhaps clouds my judgement when it comes to this film, due in part because of my lack of respect for remakes,sequels,reboots or whatever you want to do. Sure sometimes they come out good,but I prefer the Original which I have seen than this remake(which I also Have seen)."
2,Another pointless remake,"This remake has none of the original's underlying creepiness and instead tries too hard to retell a story that has already been done flawlessly. As they say, if it's not broke don't try to fix it and this film is the perfect demonstration. The child who plays Damien has maybe 10 lines in the whole movie and instead just sits around looking constipated. Julia Stiles, who I adore, has all the emotion of a grapefruit as she plays the mother of the antichrist. Liev Schreiber, much like Derek Zoolander, has one look throughout the entire film--which I like to call ""Bored."" If the point of a remake is to offer a new perspective on an old tale, this movie serves no purpose. If you're in the mood to see the Omen go ahead and rent the original because this version falls way off the mark."
2,Bland and boring,"Maybe i expected too much from this movie. But i was left feeling very disappointed. It seems to have been another one of those 'the best parts end up in the trailer' type of films. which is sad because it could have been as good, if not better then the original. More then anything, i found this to be incredibly slow moving. At 95mins, it feels much longer. As far as the acting goes, I have never been a fan of Schreiber, but here, he's nothing more then a bland, emotionless cardboard cut out excuse for a 'devoted' husband and father. Pass on this one, and check out the original instead."
1,was it ok to root for the bad guy ?!?!?!?!?!,"i cared so very little for these charactors that they couldnt die fast enough.this is a horrible movie and im fortunate enough to have rented this.in fact,i returned it the same day.side note.....stiles represented the spoiled rich wife to a tee.i cheered when she crash landed."
3,MY HOPES WERE HIGH!,"Um, well, I saw the original and hated it. Maybe because it wasn't really scary. Then I saw this one. My expectations were really high, but when I walked out of the theater, it just dropped a little. It was slow and the scary level was at a all time low. But there were a couple jumpy parts. Well, i guess if your intrested, its worth a shot. But I wouldn't really get my hopes up."
2,america's critic,remake that sucked the original wasnt that great horror films like this arent even scary they are just dull like the omen its pure dull
1,Waste of Money and Time I say...,"I was so dissapointed as soon as the movie started, because of the horrible acting. I've never seen the original but I've heard good things about it so why not give this one a shot right? Geeeze was I wrong. The story line is not too bad but I think there could of been a lot more changes to make it even better, more scary and more surprising. It's too easy of a movie to figure out. I barely had to follow along to know what was going on, and what was going to happen. So if you don't like to think too hard, this movie is perfect for you.The only thing I liked about this flim was Mia Farrow..now she was creepy! Great acting on her part, everyone else was just cheese! From a can if you will. Maybe bacon flavor...After I watched the movie I tuned into the special features and I watched a trailer on the original and got even MORE dissapointed to see that it was made EXACTLY like the original. You have got to be kidding me! What's the point in that? So this movie sucks..."
1,Appalling,"This is the worst remake i have ever seen hands down. Woefully miscast with none of the creepy atmosphere and classiness of the original, this film belongs in the scrap heap."
3,the omen,it was so much like thee original omen i thought that it was the original except for the change in special effects it could have given you more of a twist to this version of the film but instead it was mostly word for word of the original movie of the first omen i liked mia farrows performance of the nanny instead of her playing the mother of thee anti christ this timebut other than that liev shriver was realy trying in this film addaptation of the omen but he just didnt have any type of script to work with in my opinion this was a bust.
3,333 Not 666,The Omen is one of my favorit Horror movies of all timei'm talking about the Original one the act in the old one is more than great but 2006 omen is more of an Hollywood remake than a remake of 1976 omenthis one is cool for the new generation2006 Omen 3 Star1976 Omen 6 starover all ( worth waching )
3,"The original is the best,but the recent ""OMEN"" is good and worth a look.","MOST OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE ORIGINAL ""OMEN"" WITH LEE REMICK AND GREGORY PECK LOVED THE RECENT ""OMEN"".BASICLY THIS ""OMEN"" 2006/2005 WAS REMAKE WITH MINOR CHANGES,BUT WORTH A LOOK.LEIV SCHRIEBER AND JULIA STILES WERE GOOD IN THEIR ROLES.MIA FARROW AS BLALOCK WAS PSYCHO WHICH WORKED....DEVOTED PSYCHO NANNY WITH DEVOTED PSYCHO ROTTWIELLER/DEVIL DOG. DEVIL DOGS ANYONE?"
2,Pointless,"This is almost a frame-for-frame remake of the original classic, diluted to carry a 15 (US PG-13) certificate, where the original still retains an 18 (US R) rating.In summary - don't bother, Gregory Peck & Lee Remick were way better.I give it 2 stars - rather than 1 - for Mia Farrow as the Nanny and Pete Postlethwaite as the doomed priest, plus the decapitation scene is nicely done.Has there ever been a worthy remake?"
2,"Never remake a classic, it'll always fail","A man accidentally takes home the son of the devil as a replacement for his dead baby and eventually must try to stop the world from ending by killing the boy.The script was choppy, the acting weak and there was no suspense or horror. Watch at your own risk, two hours you won't get back."
5,Obvious Remake Material,"This is probably the most obvious film to remake when the release date is July 6, 2006, a date chosen before the film was done.Overall the film is very Good, when seen on its own and in no way comparing it to the original.Mia Farrow, Michael Gambon and David Thewlis are excellent in their respective roles; Mia being suitably diabolical, and Gambon exceedingly excessive.The extras are fun too, and very enlightening, especially the Black Friday event. The promise of other Omen remakes is nice, especially if they pick more intense actors.Sadly, if comparing this film to the 1976 original is done, well, the original is a gem. What should also have been done is a Re-Release of the original with Punched up audio, cleaned up Video, and enhanced everything.The original Omen Films are still master works. A pity that the casting was not on the same par.However, I did enjoy the film, Missed on the release date, but happily purchased with a suitably Cool Iron Maiden special edition."
2,Lousy.,"Yet another failed remake. This version of The Omen not only collects and regurgitates all of the problems with the original, but adds a slew of its own including (in no particular order): (1) a silly kid whose goofy/evil faces are laugh-out-loud ridiculous; (2) the modern cinematic penchant for using loud, jarring sounds in lieu of genuine scares; (3) some genuinely bad acting (particularly from Julia Stiles -- if she gets another role after this, there must be some particularly profound shortage of minimally decent actors in Hollywood); and (4) implausible sequences and plot holes so large Arnold could drive his Hummer through them.Seeing this film is genuinely a waste of your good time.Trust me."
1,POINTLESS REMAKE WATCH THE ORIGINAL!,The remake is not as creepy or as good as the original. It is a complete waste of time. This film adds nothing new or does anything better than the original. Why???
3,Not as good as the Original but still not bad.,I loved watching the original's over and over as a 5 year old kid. I knew when the music came that someone was gonna DIE ! I also liked the satanic hellhound dog and the crow from the trilogy. The new movie is not as thrilling. The visual quality is excellent. Some of the actors seem bored themselves in this movie. It seems like like they wanted this movie to be overwith and take home their paycheck asap. It might just be me but thats what i noticed. Julia Stiles and Mia Farrow did an excellent job though. I dont think a 5 year old would enjoy this more than 1 time.
2,Unsatisfying,"I bought this because ""Repeat Performance"" is one of my favorite Golden Age mysteries. But I never managed to finish this book, which I found uninteresting and pedestrian."
3,you can never go wrong with social d!!!,"Social Distortion is a great band, and this is definitely an album you should add to your collection. Now, the songs aren't quite the same style as the rest of the songs in the social d collection l; but, they still rock. The only difference is that they don't have as much rockabilly influence in there; it seems to be strictly punk based. The songs are catchy, and straight to the point. Topics include poorness, pain of losing love, society ruining everything, and mostly stuff like that. Oh, there is also a cover of under my thumb by the rolling stones. I like social d's version better. Old style coolness with a modern slant on it. I recommend it. Take care."
4,LOUD AND BEAUTIFUL,"The flesh and the Spirit wage war within Mike Ness, and he and his band put this across with brutal honesty and sonic power. An album full of great hooks and tight, kick ass beats. One of the most strangely inspiring albums I've ever heard. A few more months of listening, and I may rate it 5 stars."
1,Don't buy from scrap2stamp,I never received this CD! I purchased it from scrap2stamp and they ripped me off! Don't buy from this seller! scrap2stamp will screw you over!
4,Good Effort,"Social Distortion have been rocking for decades now. And this is one of their cds you shouldn't pass up. While the cd isn't as 'punk' as some of their earlier works, it still is a nice shot of rock and roll.The song 'I Was Wrong' was probably their biggest hit from the album, and it's a great tune, but please don't overlook the rest of the songs. Good cd and worth adding to your collection."
3,"A Kind Of Sleazy ""Thelma & Louise""","I watched the rated-R version of this film; perhaps it was edited in a way that made the story virtually incomprehensible? In any event, I had a terrible time figuring out who was who and what the hell was going on. It didn't help that the lighting was poor in many of the scenes, either. Other than these issues, the movie wasn't terrible (I watched it all the way through, anyway). On the plus side, the acting was good, the actresses beautiful (and naked most of the time), and it's always interesting to me to see a slice of life in a different country than mine (the film is set in Greece, and not the Greece most tourists ever see).Depressing, low-budget, gritty, realistic, and sex-laden, there is definitely an audience for this genre of film...just leave it uncut next time; we can handle it!"
2,"well, the movie is missing","this is supposedly Greek movie and it so happened i visited country numerous times and when i have chance i kinda connect movie with country and i see the director didnt connect anything in this flick. chicks are lousy looking and behave accordingly and my impression is all country lost except their excellent Greek's painted vases which you can buy or order to your taste and,surprisingly, these vases manage to survive for 3000 years but director missed this point completely."
2,Disappointed,If I knew that it was an iron on decal I wold not have bought this. Already peeling off. Disapponted
2,Lacks durability,"I was very disapointed with these tires as the studs wear down very quickly. I have been using these tires for approx. 2 months, mainly in snowy conditions. The studs have worn down so considerably that I do not expect them to survive the winter. Very disapointing."
4,daughters favorite,my daughter's favorite one of the series so far...she can't wait for the next one
4,Avatar Book 3 Volume 3,The story takes a strange twist as Zuko joins the Avatar team and Aang begins to learn fire bending. The journeys of the team show the maturity of the team as they face the certain knowledge that the comet is getting close and Aang and the Fire Lord will have to face each other so that the balance of the world can be restored.
5,A wonderful series!,"My 8 year old son is addicted to Avatar, which is fine with me, since I love it too!! It is an excellent series, very interesting with plenty of humor [Sokka is too funny!] and lessons learned by all.I have already pre-ordered Vol. 4....I think I am more excited about its arrival than my son!!!"
2,Not his best methinks...,"I am new to John Martyn. I was drawn to his music by my love of Roy Harper, and all things Euro-Folk. I recently purchased Live at Leeds and More, which I think is very good,and showcases his live guitar skills nicely. This set, however, presents a hit or miss opportunity, I think. Some of his strongest tracks are here, but also there is a good amount of lesser material from his more uneven albums. One might be best served to start with Leeds, and also check out his prime offerings from the mid seventies. Cheers!"
5,More vital than your toddler's milk money...,"HARD PLACE has been rocking the bi-coastal scene for years now (if you consider Michigan a coast... it's like the all-coast state) and now they're finally ascending into the world of super-pop-stardom.The true heirs of Queen, Prince, and Emo Phillips, HARD PLACE uses a chorus better than anyone in the business. This CD is toe-tapping rock majesty. Completely brilliant, but in a fascinatingly enjoyable way. Buy one copy to listen to and 12 more to eventually sell on eBay once everyone else catches on."
4,Nice Duncan!,Not bad at all. A very Nice Yo-Yo and worth the money. great buy for the value!Sleeps good and is just as desribed!
2,Super Noobish Toy,"The yoyo is supposed to sleep for at least a ""while"" but it really doesn't. You only get about 10 seconds until the buzz starts to fade. If you're a new guy, you don't want to buy this yoyo. It's not good for starters no matter how bad it is."
3,not all the way what i expected,this came to me quickly and in good condition but it wasnt quite what i thought i was getting. I guess i sould read a little better next time. but I wanted a yoyo that did more tricks and was a little more diverse.
3,It's okay but it's not what it says,It said it has longer spin times but it's made out of plastic and the rims are barely even weighted so it really doesn't spin much longer
2,Yo Yo,Not sure why but this Yo Yo broke put it back together but its not like the original Duncan Yo Yo...Sorry !!!
1,Phony,"Don't be fooled!!!!!!!!! I bought another yoyo at the same time as this one and i ended up buying 2 of the exact same yoyos. The yoyo you get is nothing like the picture. And worst of all, the yoyos does not spin long at all. 3 seconds tops. And if you throw it even slightly hard, it will come up so fast and really hurt your hand. Your better off saving your money and buying a decent yoyo."
4,We will see on Christmas!,Got this as a gift for my Father-in-law for Christmas. Looks nice so I am sure he will love it :)
2,Poor shipping time,After 2 phone calls and 1 e-mail I received Season 2&3 of weeds 28 days after I odered it .
1,buy separately!,its cheaper to buy them individually. they total to $48.97 w/free shipping.on another note. this show is amazing! i love it. can't wait for the season finale tonight! :)
5,Weeds review,What was displayed was exactly what I received. It gave me a review of the shows I was purchasing. I love Weeds!
3,flimsy packaging,"The item was sent in a envelope style package which resulted in some bending in DVD package and caused the DVDs to come loose inside. Fortunately, they weren't scratched."
3,Decent show. There are better.,This show is pretty good. Not very realistic but for entertainment it's worth watching. Description said it was a gut buster comedy but it wasn't. A laugh here and there but not gut busting.
5,Showtime's flagship show in a Blu-Ray bundle -- the reason to own a PS3 and subscribe to Showtime,"This Amazon Exclusive bundle gives anyone with access to Blu-Ray, the chance to experience this comedy that throws dog droppings on our ideas of an ideal community, family, and our tremulous American Dream. Those who have followed the show should watch for details missed during the seasons that began in 2005 with a more mild mannered Nancy Botwin. We now have watched her transformation into the irresistible and provocative character she is now, but the journey is nice to see all at once.Amazon's bundle is simply the 3 seasons shrink wrapped in their respective jackets offered at a lower price than apart -- Costco-esque. The extra features are fun and really -- of the few Blu-Ray/HDDVD/DVD discs you buy -- how many do you ACTUALLY watch? This one you will watch."
2,I wish the author would not have relied upon the translated sources of others.,The fact that Tisdale had to rely upon the translation of others makes her findings not as authentic as they should be.
1,Flimsy and simplistic arguments,"I would NOT want to hire Mark Smith as a ""lawyer"". His ""arguments"" read like the kind of ""evangelizing to Catholics"" pamphlets put out by Christian Fundamentalist that assume that the arguments on the other side are ""stupid"" and easy to demolish. Also, his own arguments are flawed in the light of how Bush has actually INCREASED the size of the Federal Government and instead of working to limit the power of the government over the lives of its citizens as is the libertarian goal of conservatives, has increased it through not only the Patriot Act but on how government regulations are geared not toward the boardrooms but the bedrooms. I hate to say it but this book makes Conservatives look dumb (except of course, in their own eyes). No, Conservatives need better arguments than the simplistic ones offered here."
3,Kill those looney liberals!,"I admit that I did not read this entire book. I couldn't. The palaver against ""liberals,"" whatever the hell they are (those who value liberty over totalitarianism?), was too embarrassing to sustain for very long.If you read this book and read Francione's, How To Save America, you will understand why Smith says what he says and just what his agenda really is.If you've labelled yourself a conservative, you'll love this little ""pat each other on the back"" book. But it lacks meaningful analysis and relies on superficial let's-just-take-a-quick-peek criticism that anyone with vocal chords can accomplish.It's greatest value is in naming many of the important social topics to get you thinking. Unfortunately it doesn't stop there but rather sabatages that thinking by leading the reader into illogical and hasty conclusions that ignore the complexities of many issues. This is propaganda at best.Francione is a better read and infinitely more honest."
1,Same Old Same Old...,"Reading this book (as much of it as I could stomach) reminds me of why I gave up the talk-radio-induced conservatism of my younger, less intellectual days. Lots of undocumented accusations against liberals, lots of greedy, callous indiffernce towards his fellow countrymen who aren't as well off as he is, lots of mindless ""analysis"" of the issues. This clown does his friend Ann ""Kill Their Leaders & Convert Them"" Coulter proud. I still can't figure out how these flag-waving super-patriots can claim to love their country so much more than ""treasonous"" liberals while showing such utter contempt for their less fortunate fellow Americans. If Smith, Coulter, Savage, Hannity etc. are the best and brightest the right has to offer, it's a sad commentary on our society that this vicious ideology has advanced as far as it has. Very disconcerting indeed."
1,Unimpressed.,"Same old right-wing, ad hominem trash that we Americans have all become boringly acusstomed to.It were these very same right-wing Republican conservative demagogues, employing identical arguments as Mark Smith to hijack America's foreign policy therby taking us into an invasion that has become a nightmare. It suited their interests and now we are all paying a price.The book also suggests that the choice before the American voter in the 2004 election is clear:Re-elect Bush and continue on our path or elect a novice Sen. Kerry.I'd put it another way, elect Bush and continue America's path to endless conflicts built upon flagrant lies or elect a witty Senator from Mass. so he can deliver 'US' from the evil shannigans of the neoconservative endless-war mind."
1,The right wing sucks,"The right wing does not make any sense. How does ignoring scientific evidence, denying people their constitutional rights, and having a very narrow view on issues such as abortion improve our society? Leave our country alone!"
1,Poorly Written With Few Facts to Support Assertions,"I am amazed with how many of these authors are getting away with this type of writting. If you are writting an opinion piece don't try to back up your assertions with fraudulent type sources. There are more lies, exagerations, and opinions that are being reported as facts than I've seen in any one book in a long time. Regardless of your political beliefs I would ask you to not buy in to this type of garbage. Make up your own mind about what you think and feel and please check sources before subscribing to a belief system that belongs to someone else."
4,"Quick, easy and to the point",Enjoyed this book very much. Largely anecdotal evidence to support the claims of conservatism. Quick and easy and to the point.
5,Great Book!,This book should be on every conservative's bookshelf. Mark Smith provides all the ammunition you need in a concise and humorous manner to overcome just about any loony left argument. A great resource for sparring with your liberal friends!
4,The Official Handbook of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy,"Though I count myself as a fairly well read conservative I found the ""Cliff Note"" format of this conservative primer a nice review of many topics that aren't raised in everyday conversation. I've passed it along to my 19 year old as a light read to help her as she is formulating her political basis. The liberal stand is certainly well represented in her collegiate suroundings.I don't feel that this is meant to compete with Coulter, Horowitz, D'Souza and other indepth intellectual/historical think-tank type authors. But for the new student of conservatism or the not-so-well-versed, it can provide some snappy retorts to irritating leftist statements."
3,Smith concedes too much,"This book is a quick, easy read and does indeed provide many good arguments to support the right-wing agenda. However, Smith too often falls back on arrogance and self-righteousness to bolster his position.The book is written in the form of arguments liberals might make, followed by the VRWC rebuttal. And on several occasions, Smith follows three great rebuttals with a fourth that amounts to ""Yeah? So what."" He sets up a liberal complaint and then concedes that there is no good response. The problem is, there are good responses to be found. They're just not in Smith's book. He does a disservice to the right by including these ""because I say so, that's why"" non-arguments.This is a good book to help you get your bearings; it would likely serve as a great intro for young republicans. But this is no substitute for serious conservative thought."
5,Excellent Summary of Political Conservatism!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The author really doesn't tell me anything new about political conservatism, but he does bring a myriad of issues together under one cover. Smith's writing style is entertaining and enlightening. For people with more of a leaning to the left, this title shouldn't be seen as a piece of trash or propaganda, but as an informative description of the positions of the political right. Although I admit to being a political conservative, I'd enjoy reading a similar volume summarizing the views of the political left!Among the many politically right-leaning books on the market today, this one is a must-read!"
4,Good but too short!,"Hmm. The loony liberals described in Smith's book are so nicely depicted by Amazon's own reviewers: from character assassins to those who prefer to replace Bush with a man whose strategy in the fight against terror seems to be to undermine his own country's security. Coincidence???There is nothing in Smith's book that I disagree with, but it's not in depth enough. True it's only a handbook and Smith does provide a resource list at the end. Good quick read. Already used it against my in-laws' liberal family and they'll probably never invite me over again!!!"
5,Concise and empowering,"Among the myriad of books available to the conservative shopper, I am convinced that Mark Smith's ""Official Handbook of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy"" is the most cogent and pursuasive one out there. This practical guide to debunking some of the Left's most outrageous myths is worth it's weight in gold. If you are looking for a quick guide to help you make all your liberal friends look like fools, than this book is for you."
1,Absolute rubbish,"I guess this is right-wing ""humor"". I can't see Smith winning too many cases if this is the way he argues during legal proceedings. Smith's myopic arguments lack intellectual depth and are full of circular reasoning. A lot of ""I think so because I think so."" It's all just polemics.Compare this book to things like James Carville's ""We're Right, They're Wrong"" or the collection ""The I Hate Republicans Reader: Why The GOP Is Totally Wrong About Everything"" to see the differences in style between the two sides.Oh, and to all those who are thinking of using material from this book to stump liberals during debates, I say: Yes, please do !"
1,naive,"This book's argument is largely that fewer laws and regulations unfetter business, and business is the engine of progress and wealth. What the author refuses to consider is that lawless businesses freely pollute at will, as the number of toxic waste sites in this country shows.The author would put us back in the time when raw sewage freely poured into rivers, smokestacks freely belched poisons into the air, and when children had the freedom to work in factories and mines, regardless of age. Nothing in a business's concern with the bottom line would have ended these practices without federal regulation.A useful antidote to this book is Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights - Thom Hartmann;"
2,Depends on who you talk to,"You'll find this book useful and insightful if you only talk to other conservatives. You'll find a lot to pat each other on the back about. But if you ever talk to actual liberals (and assuming you have the intellectual honesty to admit when you're wrong) you'll quickly find that Smith grossly distorts some liberal positions for the sake of knocking them down (straw man argument), or else offers shaky support for his points.Just like Coulter, Hannity and Limbaugh, Smith has to be selective and sometimes dishonest in his presentation in order to make a case."
1,Preaching to the choir,"Any person who attempts to use this stuff against a serious liberal will come away bloodied. Mr. Smith actually plucked some short criticism from this site when he was on a CSPAN program. He overlooked difficult to deal with criticism. He does not provide facts that are indisputable. Watching Mr Smith in the flesh he is a standard right wing hack lacking of original ideas. If he is what conservatives had to offer in the wake of the 2000 elections to explain the right wing side of Bush v Gore the real conservatives stayed home that day. A note to Mr Smith... not all judges are un-elected. The US Supreme Court would be the most glaring example. Also lots of middle class families do not send their children to schools that cost $100,000 for four years of tuition. If you think you are conservative and want your biases fed get this book. Just don't expect it to give you actual armor against an informed liberal."
4,A good summation,"While nothing new, Mark Smith has written the Official Handbook for anyone who feels like bashing the Loony Liberals. He sums up all of the arguments quite well. Short and to the point, it says what needs saying without all the fluff a liberal would probably add."
4,The Perfect Gift for Conservatives,"With the purchase of this book you will completely free yourself of the need to think for yourself. Just listen to Rush's instructions, read Mark's book and keep it handy for those many times when YOU don't know the reason for your position, but have to look it up. I can't wait for the Big Print edition to come out!"
5,The Left's secret is out with this one.,"When I first saw this book I thought it would be written by a Republican strategist and not a lawyer. I was even more amazed that this book is written to everyone and everyone needs to read this in order to understand what is being said versus what is actually being meant.I remember hearing about the ""Vast Right Wing Conspiracy"" and how it was doing this and doing that, yet there was never any real evidence of this conspiracy. With the release of this book you get to see what Left is trying to say and what this Right is actually doing.What this book exposes is the lies, obfuscations, demagogues and misleading statements and actions. The book also shows you what you need to do in order to stand up and be counted. The book is sort of the Conservative Self Starter talking points.So for those who are in the Conspiracy or those who want to be or even those on the edge, this book will take you and guide you through the process."
5,Good Book for younger readers,"If you're a conservative and understand what that means, and the reasons behind it this book will give you a good laugh- Mark W. Smith is really good at keeping his audiences attention. However I found this book most beneficial on my college room mates- you know the type ""I'm a Republican/ Democrat because my parents are... but I don't really care about politics"" Or my ""Conservative"" roomies who only really cared about the moral issues- this book explains why socialism is bad and other usweful concepts high school and college kids do not understand. It's also a fun enough read that people who hate reading wont get bored with it. Overall a good informative book."
1,"Right leg in, right leg out, do the hokey cokey","A book for all those who think that animals do not include ""invertabrates"" and insects. Guys like this wouldn't have an audience if people were well enough educated to think for themselves and didn't need the likes of Ann Coulter to do it for them."
4,Resource models explained,"A super helpful book for non-econ, calculus-literate students of environmental science. For environmental econ students, here's an excellence reference book that explains the basic models more thoroughly than most other environmental econ books. Also includes a reasonable amount of bibliographical information to start off research in the discipline."
5,An important new book by an amazing man,"I highly recommend Christopher Reeve's new book, Nothing Is Impossible. It is an easy, fast read and straight forward. I could well relate to certain life experiences he has had and his conclusions about certain things. It helped me clarify certain issues too which was of invaluable worth personally. I also have seen Reeve's recent tv interviews on Charley Rose and 20/20 in which Reeve handled himself superbly. Everyone should read his book and all that his book can offer many readers. Reeve is a man of worthwhile, powerful social change in a stubborn system. His book gives very important evidence and clues into how the human mind. body and spirit can and does work. Superman is someone we should all pay attention to and he has some very sound ideas and reasons. His book is now among my most selective works and for future rereadings. Great book cover too!"
4,Amazing story,"I always loved Christopher Reeve. His catastrophic accident made him even more a hero. This book goes into the incredible journey of learning to live with a completely disabling injury. But he never slowed down, never stopped fighting. He tells of his injury but also of setting up his foundation, of his appearances before many audiences, and his continual struggle to be the first who best his immobility. This is an awesome book."
5,God Bless Christopher Reeve!,"In his follow-up to ""Still Me,"" Christoper Reeve brings his optimism that he WILL overcome his devastating cervical neck injury. While it is sad knowing that the injury ultimately cost him his life, Mr. Reeve's perspective is one of the most uplifting memoirs I've ever read. Being a huge fan, I feel blessed that he's left this document for us to continue to love and cherish his memory and how he made the world a better place for the short time he was in it.Tom HarveyAuthor of ""The Eighties: A Bitchen Time To Be a Teenager!"""
5,Inspirational!,"I picked up this book at my school's library and started glancing through it. It's possibly one of the most motivational and inspirational books I've seen! Reeve recounts all of his trials and how he learned to function again. Throughout it all, he stayed strong with his wife Dana, who supported him through everything. A must read!"
2,Inspirational Until...,"I found the book inspirational for reasons already well expressed on this board until I got to the part where Mr. Reeve seized the opportunity to take a couple cliched potshots at the Catholic religion. I've been very active in Catholic parishes and schools in several different cities and countries all my life and was never subject to the shame-ridden browbeating he depicts which is not part of Catholic teaching. I'm happy this unfortunate man finds his new-found religion fulfilling, but I wish people would make an effort to understand or update their information about groups other than their own before they go bashing, especially in such a public manner."
2,Not Especially Compelling or Uplifting,"I couldn't help thinking how lost Reeves is, despite his remarkable efforts to remedy his injury.Only the discussions of his new post-accident actions and sensations he's been able to will his body to achieve are interesting.I can easily see how someone with motor damage would find this book powerful. But, for the general audience...I can't see it. Then again, I was listening to the audio version and his vocalizations are necessarily flat."
1,A Disappointment,"There is a big difference between this and his first book Still Me. Still Me was interesting, but this book goes into detail about his medical condition and the daily life of being in a wheelchair. I did not find that interesting at all and I can't imagine other readers finding it interesting either. Also, I find it rather funny that Chris Reeve announced he had some movement in his hands and feet right around the time this book came out. Great for the book, but I felt cheated as reader. Who is the publisher kidding."
5,An Inspiration,"My experience has been that physically challenged people are some of the happiest people I know. Since most of us have all our faculties, and are often unhappy, we have so much to learn from people like Christopher Reeve. He and others like him are a true inspiration."
5,Love this CD,Josh Kelley's cd Almost Honest is one of the best I've heard in awhile. He has a little bit of something for everyone to enjoy. I know its on heavy repeat in my apartment!
1,Almost Honest... but not quite,"The title and theme of ""Almost Honest"" borrow heavily from Megadeth's song of the same name. This artist should be honest and give credit to the original song."
1,This kid should have...,gone to music school somewhere else. That school in oxford did NOT do him any good. Poor boy.
2,Missed Opportunity,"His first CD was a great begining, showing promise and great potential, but his second effort is just plain boring! This stuff is way to polished with nothing new in either sound or substance. Most everything here is forgetable throw-away pop. This CD misses the mark. Only hardcore fans need acquire."
2,This passes for funk and soul now?,First and formost... White guys can NOT sing soul music. They don't have the charisma or the vocal rhythm to do it. This is just more extremely slick pop music.Where is the fire and passion?
5,Awesome Album,"I love this album. It shows off his amazing vocals and is a step above his debut. This CD is constantly playing in my CD player, and I'm so happy that I was able to buy it. ""Almost Honest"" is my top ten CD of the year!"
5,Give it a try,"At first I wasn't very impressed with this cd, but I knew I had to give it a try because that was how I felt about his first cd. I ended up absolutely falling in love with his first cd after about a year after I got it. After listening to most of this cd for a few days now, I LOVE it! Walk Fast if my favorite right now. And as for all the ones saying that this cd is more polished, who cares? He's an artist and he can do what he wants. I am very pleased."
5,A great sophomore album,"Josh Kelley is an amazing artist and his new album ""Almost Honest"" is a great follow up to his first album ""For the Ride Home"".This album is a little more ""pop"" than his first ablum with some faster, upbeat songs. After listening to the album a couple of times, I was hooked. He has amazing vocals which make it another great add to the cd.It's a great cd all in all, and worth the price. If you enjoyed his first album, you'll enjoy this one too. Definitely a great buy."
5,"""Summer Maddness""","The very first time I heard Kool and the Gang, I was at a house party. They had a destinct sound of Jazz and R&B. During this time many bands were in competition with one another. However, Kool and the Gang never waivered and when they played they really made it look so effortless. Their music was so smooth that you could listen or dance to it. It was a priviledge to watch them grow. I remember seeing them on TV, singing their song Hollywood Swingin, and guess what? They were really in Hollywood, they finally made it! No one puts it down like Kool."
1,Light of the Worlds,Unfortunately only the theme Summer Maddnes is worth the CD - The rest of the CD is garbage I am sorry to say.
2,Disappointed,The plastic frame surrounding the speaker cracked on both of them in the package. There was no damage to the package so I suspect there is a manufacturing problem with these speakers.
2,You Can't Judge A Book By Its Cover,"I saw the cover and thought that this book was surely full of cute and creative ideas that I could use in my teaching next year. However, when I recieved the book, the picture on the cover was the only creative element of the book. The reason it was not useful was because the book is in black and white sketchings of bulletin boards that were very unclear and did not include many templates. I did keep the book in hopes that i can use what is given and improve it with my own ideas."
2,Don't waste your money,"The subject material was just glossed over, some important concepts were not discussed at all, the practice questions were too easy, and I found numerous errors through out the book. I was constantly referring to old textbooks and ended up giving up on the book. I suggest you save your money and buy a different study guide."
5,Very good remote,This remote is fairly easy to program. It replaced 4 other remotes and I was able to program all functions from the 4 other remotes.The display could be a little easier to read but is not bad. My teenage kids used it right away without reading instructions. My wife however can not figure it out-maybe this is a plus.
1,Doesn't work with Dish Network Receiver,I cannot find any code for Dish Network satellite receivers in the manual. Contacting Sony support offered no help at all.
1,Flawed from the factory - the absoute worst!,"I bought it, put in the batteries, and immediately needed a magnifying glass to read the worst LCD display I have ever seen (actually, could not see) in my life. After squinting and fumbling through some programming features, I started to feel that I was doing something wrong. I realized that I could select all devices to program EXCEPT THE TV! You simply cannot program the TV! You can program a digital cable box, a vcr, ... etc. But the device acts like it will let you select the TV BUT IT DOES NOT! Sony cost me hours of shopping and a couple of frustrating hours to find that they shipped a broken product. This will make me think twice about other Sony products' quality in the future."
4,"For geeks only, not for the impatient","Those who lack patience or are not willing to spend time deciphing a cryptic manual, stay away. Yes this can be an annoying device to program and use, but those who persevere can save lots of money by buying this unit over it's more expensive competitors. Other reviews detail some of the specific annoyances.Update: Year and a half later and the joystick button is toast. I don't relish the thought of reprogramming, But I'll probably buy another."
2,Two Serious Flaws,"I also found the the display very hard to read even after adjusting the contrast and with or without the backlite on.The fact that the buttons beside the display do not line up with the choices they represent is just truly bad design.I never even got to the annoying labeling process.This unit has lots of great features, just too many flaws.Mine's going back in the morning."
1,First Regret,"I've been buying Sony products for almost 30 years and this is the first time I've regretted a purchase. Over the years, I've used perhaps two or three dozen Sony remotes, both original equipment and after-market and this one is the first I'd describe as a truly poor product.The over-all concept was not a bad idea, but the astonishingly low quality of the backlit LCD display is simply unacceptable in 2003. It is the worst display I've seen on a portable device in at least ten years. There is virtually no lighting situation in which it is easy to read.I did start programming it, but soon realized that the display was bad enough to keep me from ever seriously using it. I now keep it on my desk to control the volume and change TV channels while I work or web surf. It does look good on my desk. For actually using my AV system, I went back to the RM-VL900."
5,Not user friendly but wow what a controller~!,We use this remote for our solar tracker controller. Setup is cumbersome but without this remote we'd be searching.I will not be able to use this remote for a few weeks or so (it's for a future tracker build) but it seems to be functional so we're satisfied.
2,Be careful about battery,"After putting lots of efforts to program it, it worked fine though still not perfectly. At least partially work with all my devices. Until one day, I notice the LCD is not as stable as it was. It dimmed after I push any button. I immediately realized the battery is out of juice. I put a fresh pair there, and then I found all the programming was lost. I need to reprogram it. I still remember all those programming pain and I gave up. I just fall back to use my 4 to 5 remotes."
4,strong album from BJM,"I won't comment much about other reviews except to point out that BJM main man Anton Newcombe seems to relish provoking a response from people, good or bad, and he clearly succeeds in provoking some bad feedback. Be that as it may.This album is very strong. There are lots of great tunes including Geezers, Tschusse, When Jokers Attack, Prozac vs Heroin, and others. As with all BJM albums, Newcombe's songwriting is the story and he delivers the usual number of gems this time around.You can sample BJMs music here http://www.brianjonestownmassacre.com/mp3.php. Note that the songs from And this is Our Music that appear there were early versions that have evolved slightly for the final release. Make up your own minds! My mind says: essential."
4,Why so brutal?,"This album fits very nicely alongside all other BJM recordings. If you don't like the band why listen to or buy the cd? It's not my favorite BJM work, but it's pretty darn good."
2,hitting a new low. . .,"Truth be known, this band peaked seven years ago and then imploded into a psychotic wasteland. You can come back, but you can't come back all the way. Admittedly, the best song on the album describes the exact point in the trajectory of this 13- year music project. (see review title) The BJM will always be the band that launched a hundred bands, but is too dangerous for mass consumption."
1,offal,"to compare these utter poseurs to spacemen 3 or the cure or whoever is simple sacriledge. the rutles are brilliant and meant to be funny. brian jonestown is just a sad, sick joke. i kinda hate to write this 'cause the mental-case (he's kicked his own ""fans"" in the face at his gigs) frontman feeds off of the derision he cultivates, but really, kids, this band must be stopped. sure the records are tuneful, but so affected and derivative that you...oh forget it. one wastes one's breath loathing them."
1,Book was never published - it doesn't exist,This edition was never published therefore it doesn't exist and should not be listed.
2,"Cool Product, But Customer Service Is a Joke","I just bought the hyper st. The carb was not set properly out of the box so of course I couldn't get it started. The RTR does not even come with instructions letting you know the carb is not set or how to tune it for the break in period. I called OFNA technical support and got hung up on by some punk kid named ""DJ"". Don't buy this product, unless you want to be at the mercy of some pubescent dipstick named ""DJ"". Its also hard to find and identify the parts for the carbuerator. I had to go to about 10 different hobby shop sites before I could find a main needle assembly. I'm starting to think I should have gone with the HPI Hellfire Instead."
5,Gorham Column Frosted Stainless Flatware 5-Pece Place Setting,This is a pretty set. My son and his wife picked out this pat. and I try to buy one each year for Christmas.
3,A Self-Invented Legend,"For listeners of a certain generation, Alistair Cook is synonymous with LETTER FROM AMERICA, a weekly broadcast that ran for nearly fifty years on Radio 4/ the BBC Home Service, as well as being the host of countless arts programs on both sides of the Atlantic. Nick Clarke's biography tries to reveal the 'real' Cooke, but actually shows how Cooke consciously reinvented himself, to such an extent that he was perhaps unable to reveal 'the real Cooke' - if such a person existed - to anyone. Cooke was a shining example of what might be described as a media personality, shaped and defined by both print and broadcasting."
1,"I would have give it zero stars, but that wasn't an option","You must be kidding me? The greatest ever? Not even close! This study bible champions such classic heresies as Sabelian Modalism, the Serpent Seed Hypotheses, Baptismal Regeneration, Positive Confession, the strange and unscriptural notion that there once was a preadamic demonic race under the leadership of Lucifer, Adamic Hyper-Dominion, that faith is force that can magically alter physical reality, and many false teachings of the Word of Faith movement. This study bible may have more cross references than the Thompson Study Bible, but that is only because so many of them are spurious. This study bible was obviously written by a collection of fully heterodox apostates. Do yourself a favor, buy just about any other study bible on the market. Almost anything is better. If you are Charasmatic, read The Full Life Study Bible. If you don't believe me then just call Hank Hanegraaff (the Bible Answer Man) and ask him."
1,BIG MISTAKE TO BUY,So i bought the same exact thing from toys r us a couple of years ago. My sister and i wanted to try it out. We bought the game and opened it up and we were ready to play it. We set up the mats and the disk and got ready to play. It turned out that it's an automated DVD and the mats you step on with the arrows on them DO NOT TRACK YOUR MOVES. The game will just keep saying good job or you're doing great. There's no connection of the mats to the tv so you don't get a score.. It's really not even a toy or a game.
4,"Great rainy day game, gets 'em moving!","I bought this despite several reviews that complained that the mat is not connected to the TV. I actually prefer this feature. The game is perfect for younger kids (5 to 8 years). There are 3 levels of difficulty and about 10 different songs/dance routines per level. The production quality is very basic, but the kids get the point and are happy to have an inside game that gets them moving when the weather is bad. Was also great activity for play dates."
2,Not What I Expected :(,"I did not know that this product did not have a responsive mat system. So basically the game does not know whether you stepped right or wrong. This was just a turn off for me, and I am returning the item.However, if it's not a problem for you, it could be a great work out!"
1,Good vs. Bad,"I got this awhile ago, and I haven't had a good reason to like it. You can get caught up in it, but it is not a plug-in, so it doesn't really count the arrows.My recommendation: either buy the plug-in version, though that isn't very good either, or wait and get a wii, or a different system and buy the game. I think that is what I will do."
2,Not what I thought,"It's my own fault, but this is not what I thought we were getting. The mats do not connect with the game in any way so it's not actually a ""game"". There is no right or wrong or score. Good for young enough kids who don't really care though."
1,don't buy this,"Like the other reviewer who gave it a 1 Star rating, I completely agree....do not buy this!!! It shouldn't be categorized as a game. Theirs is not connection between the DVD and the mat. I checked on the description prior to purchasing this and didn't see anything about it until I got the box where it says ""training mat not connected to the DVD"". Don't bother with this product. I'm returning it ASAP!!!"
1,bad bad revolution,i play the real dance dance revolution at the YMCA my mom bought this for me becuse she was to cheep to buy me a real DDR for my game cube so i put it in on my DVD player and found out it wasn't real so please just buy a ps2 xbox game cube or wii and a dance dance revolution it would make you much happier
4,Great for those without a gaming system,"I got my daughter this for her birthday and we are both enjoying it. We don't have a gaming system, but it is fun to try the dances. Drawbacks are that it isn't interactive and the music could be better. Pluses are the fun factor and it is a great workout."
3,Good for on the go fun,"If you are looking for an interactive, not to mention active, version of this game, then spring for the Wii or Xbox versions. This won't cut it. I had intended for this to be an interesting change from my regular workout, but the DVD is too rigid to be used that way, with too long intervals between the menus, and the irritating instructor having way too much screen time. The routines and the music are more than passable, and hold enough of your attention to be a fun game for adults and children for a spur of the moment kind of activity."
3,El Dolor De Pagar La Renta(1960),"El Dolor De Pagar La Renta/The Pain of Paying The Rent(1960) is an early Viruta and Capulina comedy filmed on black and white filmstock. The film gets off to a good start with Gustavo Cesar Carrion's 'Viruta and Capulina March'. Viruta and Capulina(Marco Antonio Campos and Gaspar Henaine) sell clothing for a living. Capulina befriends a handicapped boy played by Cesareo Quezadas ""Pulgarcito"". He was in the Marisol movie Ha Llegado un Angel(1961). There's cartoonish sight gags with people getting hit by bricks and hammers! The script was written by Roberto Gomez Bolanos(alias Chespirito). Many sight gags from this film were recycled in episodes of El Chavo Del Ocho and El Chapulin Colorado. The pretty, photogenic women in this movie help. This decent movie is worth watching if you see it on Dish Network."
5,The best of the Shangri-las,"Very well done CD ""The Mercury Years"". I fell in love with them as a teen and still like to listen to them. The CD was made in Australia and very well done. If you like the Shangri-las i recommend this one."
5,"Great cuddly stuffed dog - high quality, what else would you expect from Gund?","Yardley Dog is a high quality stuffed animal from Gund, and as we can attest, it is 5 year old approved. He is adorable and soft, and a great companion toy for any kid. His fur is long and stringy, and we found my son especially liked his big floppy ears. I will caution that this toy is a little larger than we anticipated, but my son did not mind. He also has quite a few tags that we removed because my son complained they were not very soft. That being said, this is a great and thoughtful present that will be appreciated for years to come."
3,Decent Intro to Understanding Pagan Origins of Christianity,"This book introduces the study of pagan origins for Christianity. It is quite concise and gives the reader a primer on the subject. However, if you are looking for an exhaustive study, you will not find it in this 32 page booklet"
3,Not Much To It,Interesting book although not much I didn't already know. But to call this a book is a stretch; it's a booklet.
4,Pagan Origins of the Christ Myth,The book gave me the info I needed. I still feel confident in my decisions. I liked how there were references for people who have studied the subject so I can do further study. This is a very short book with mostly information on how to get more.
4,great for beginners,"this book is great for someone who is interested in learning more about the origins of Christianity. i am really interested in learning more but all the information thats out there can get overwhelming, this is a good start that lays it out right in front of you. no frills, just the basics. it gives a good foundation to start with. its a really quick read and i would recommend try to get it locally instead of paying s&h for a 20+ page book."
4,Thank God I found this!!!,"This is an excellent essay even though the writer and publisher are atheist. WARNING this book is not for baby Christians. If you do not know the truth and history of Nimrod and have no knowledge of the Mazzaroth or the Book of Enoch this book is not for you if you are a Christian. However, if you know these things this book will increase your faith. I would bet if the author knew these things that he would turn Christian also and the title of this book would have been Christ Origins of Pagan Myths. I thank God that I found this book and it helps me put the pieces together so that I am not ignorant of the wiles of the devil. THANK YOU JESUS!!!!!"
3,The Halliburton Agenda: The Politics of Oil and Money,This book makes it clear that Hailiburton would have had nothing to do with the outfit that bears his name. He was a different kind of guy.
3,"OK read, but too conventional","I really liked the first volume. It was steeped in lore and ""fictional history"" with enough real history folded in to set the stage. Unfortunately, I felt that volume 2 worked too hard to fit Trek history into real history. It's an OK read. Not terribly thought provoking. I was expecting to see events unfold as described in historical references to the past when mentioned in the Trek franchise, to see how real history differed from Trek history."
5,Audacious and Highly Entertaining,"Lightening can indeed strike twice in the same place, as ""The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh, Volume Two"" proves to be every bit as exciting, entertaining and humorous as the first Volume of this saga. The second portion of this engrossing story takes the reader from the beginnings of Khan's consolidation of his power, through the events that lead to his flight from Earth on the DY-100 class sleeper ship SS Botany Bay. From beginning to end, this novel is eminently satisfying."
5,Intresting Star Trek history,This book provided an intresting look at one of the most likeable villians in the entire star trek series. They say a hero needs a perfect nemisis and Khan was it. I gained a new respect for the charactar of Khan Noonian Singh I personally felt they needed to touch on his backstory and Mr. Cox did. (Spoiler Alert) If you want to read the book Stop Now and if you read #1 then keep going. I enjoyed the continuation of the Gary Seven Roberta Lincoln story line too. Plus the Story of how the Botanay Bay came to be where kirk found it. They also found a way to tie in ST 4 and Jackson Roykirk the creator of the probe Nomad from TOS Changeling (Just watched that episode on DVD) Basicly its worth the read the youtube video only tells the last part of this book and you need to read the book to get to this
4,The Wrath of Cox!,"There's a couple of grammatical errors in the book which should have been fixed but overall this was an enjoyable book. Even though the timing may be off and the science of it may not be 100% as one reader mentioned it is still just a story.He portrays Khan perfectly and even makes the story seem realistic in many ways. Too bad that he didn't get Ricardo Montalbahn (Khan from Space Seed and The Wrath of Khan for those who don't know)to do the audio version of this story. There's a charactor from Star Trek IV in this story which surprised me along with Area 51, and the ozone layer twist.I have always been fascinated with the charactor of Khan and curious as to how he got aboard Botany Bay. Thanks Greg for letting us know. Also what would happen if Khan actually beat Kirk in Star Trek 2? Why not right a story about that?"
1,Tired of overpriced hardback books,This sould have been a paperback book. It was not interesting enough to be hardback!!
1,for juvenile trekkies only,"I hoped these books would be good, but Cox is just plain awful. Full of cute little references to every Trek series, plus inane pop culture references for every time period covered... I sighed many times, and often had to put the book down in disgust.If you are an insufferable trekkie nerd or just have very low expectations, maybe you can stomach this drivel. If you want intelligent sci-fi, look elsewhere."
2,Another Star Trek Rewrite,"Part I of this series was quite entertaining, but this one isn't what I hoped for. It's another example of rewriting the Star Trek universe in a vain attempt to fit reality. It doesn't suprise me, because this novel fits perfectly into the philosophy of the new Trek series.I gave it two stars because it did fit reality in a somewhat clever fashion, but as someone else already stated, it didn't happen this way."
5,Loggins & Messina Start At The Top Of Their Game,"Loggins & Messina's debut album, SITTIN' IN, was supposed to be Kenny Loggins' debut solo album, with Jim Messina as the producer. However, the two got along so well that they shared lead vocal, guitar, and writing chores on this album, with Messina having six writing credits and playing great guitar solos that were equal parts Roy Clark and Dickey Betts. This album has eight great cuts, especially the opening ""Nobody But You"", where Messina's blend of Roy Clark and Dickey Betts makes his guitar playing a treat to behold. Even the somewhat cloying ""House At Pooh Corner"" gains in stature among the great cuts that constitute the remainder of the album. The only problem with this CD is that, while Loggins & Messina equalled it on their self-titled second album and the live set ON STAGE, they never surpassed it on any of their later original albums."
3,good dose of early seventies west coast sound,"initially, i was familiar w k. loggins because of his songs that were hits in the eighties. i really love 'house on pooh corner'. the arrangement on the version that is on this album is way cooler than the later version recorded by loggins. there are some great eagles/poco-like harmonies all over this album. if you are a fan of west coast bands like eagles and poco, this album may be up your alley. however, i cannot attest to the fact that this album is like ""whoa this kick arse"" good. i mean, the musicianship and melodies are just fine but it's just that, excepting ""pooh corner"", there's nothing that makes this disc ""great"". to me, it's just pretty good or ok."
3,Not her best,"This is a collection which contains two early Cher albums TAKE ME HOME (1979) and PRISONER (1980). This is a good collection for fans to have. Not her best work though. They are fun albums, but Cher's voice is very flat and lifeless (off tune too). Clearly she got better over the years and made some great music. Not essential but anyone who is curious about early Cher could look into this release."
3,"This cd is fun , but but not Cher at her best","Cher is featured mostly in a disco mode on this 2 lp compilation from the disco era. The production is slick and predictable, and Cher sounds like she had to cut these lps! There is a feeling of the artist not really making the most of her god-given contralto. There are some numbers that deserve a listen. The hits "" Take Me Home"", and ""Wasn't it Good"", are commercial stand-outs.The Bob Esty penned ""Shoppin' is a real 40s' tribute and is Cher biographical too. Chers' paen to Greg Allman, ""Too Far Gone"" is one of the few songs she ever wrote to be featured on an albumn.It is a simple moving vocal, and probably the most emotive cut. ""Hell on Wheels"" and ""Outrageous"" are absolute trash, and are material noone could revive, not even the mercurial Cher."
2,Disappointing....,"I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes, comfortable and long lasting, they finally died. I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here, not as comfortable as the original (the others looked better for the work place too) but I broken them in and they were acceptable. Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two. Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same. Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them. Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much. One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear. The quality has really degraded. You might want to look elsewhere."
3,used to be 5 star,"Absolutely love this style of shoe and this is my third pair. They did a quality change for SURE. I can barely slide my foot in it's so stiff. The sole seems to be a hard plastic feel instead of the soft kind before. And the shoe ""leather"" is stiff and looks cheaper. It is still comfortable to wear, once I can cram my foot in (practically needs a shoe horn). I hope I don't have the sole cracking problems others mention here. It's a shame, this used to be a 5 star shoe."
4,Great shoe for short term comfort,"Super stylish and comfortable. Great choice for traveling and going through TSA security checkpoints at the airport. Easy slip on and off. I own these in both black and brown. Love them, but unfortunately, I can only rate these shoes 4 out of 5 stars because I stand on my feet all day at work. I started a new job about a year ago which requires standing all day. These shoes were well broken in long before then. At the end of the first day in which I wore these to work, my feet were killing me. I will still wear them, but only for travel and during off time."
5,Women's Eastlands,"This is the 2nd pair of shoes I have owned in this same style, and I LOVE them because they last FOREVER! However, the best part about Eastlands is they make a large selection of women's shoes in a size 12. Thanks Eastland for looking out for us women who have long feet!!!!"
5,Older than dirt...,I bought a pair of these in 1999 as work shoes; at the time I worked at a dress shop and was a teaching student. They were wonderful for commuting on the bus and student teaching. But it's been 13 years now and the shoes have seen better days. The inside is completely ruined and they have a slightly funky smell (as 13 yr old shoes often will) but they're still the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. I keep meaning to buy a new pair but never seem to get around to it. I love these shoes. Every few years I get the urge to toss them out (they're old and dirty and ripped up inside) but the moment I try them on again I remember why I haven't before. They are SOOOO comfy!!!Favorite pair of shoes EVER!
3,Not the best,"The package came quickly as promised. The only problem I had was that the box was beat up and the toy inside had broke loose from its tie downs. The actual item wasn't damaged, just a little scuffed up."
5,"Your Love, So Good, I can taste it!",What a masterpiece this track is! Barry and his orchestra are second to none. The instrumental prelude to this track should have been Grammy!
2,Ad for WWF,"I really wanted to like this book. I'm a big fan of Foley's ""Cactus Jack"" persona. The King's work in Memphis is legendary. This book is amusing in places, but comes off looking like an advertising for WWF programming. I realize that the WWF is widely recognized by the younger set, but it would have worked better for me if Foley had used generic grapplers instead of WWF characters. I didn't have any problem with the moon coming out; bare butts in children's books are not unprecedented. Lawler's illustrations are very good, but that's no surprise to long-time fans. If it hadn't been for the fact that I'm turned off by books that appear to be promoting specific products, I could have given the book a higher rating. I think Foley has potential as a writer; Lawler could be the second best wrestler-turned-illustrator, second only to Ted Lewin."
5,Delightful!,"A charming little piece from New York Times best-selling author and former professional wrestler Mick Foley. A clever twist on the tried-and-true tale of Christmas being saved by the unselfish heart of a small child. This book sits in my younger brother's stocking, and I'm sure he'll get a kick out of it, as did I."
2,"Best comic. Worst Novel (Okay, second worst.)","Based on perhaps the most well written Aliens comicbook to date, one wonders how David Bischoff could screw up so badly. Good-bye morality tale of a business man gaining his humanity, hello ""I'm Ripley in disguss"" macho female marine who wants to kill bugs. Could of been - should have been - a great novel, but is anything but. Only good point, nowhere near as bad as Aliens Vs Predator: Hunter's Planet."
2,"As usual, another disappointment.","I am once again disappointed by an Alien book. I wouldn't even read them, but my brother is a big fan and I like to see what type of books he's reading. I love the human alien combat scenes, I really enjoy the slam bam action, but these books need more character development. I am not a hormonal teenager like by brother, I don't need a bunch of gratuitous sex, which this book had plenty of. Instead, I want characters that I like! With these Aliem books, I haven't found a single character that I actually liked enough to care whether they got torn apart by Aliens. So, all in all, I'd say these are OK books if you like violence and sex and don't want to be involved with the characters at all."
5,A Great Read about a Great Place,"This is a must read for anyone who lives in the Boston area, goes to school in Boston, or has visited (or plans on visiting) Boston. Who knew history could be so interesting? The author provides all the facts in a colorful and exciting manner. The pictures (some black-and-white, others in color) further bring the text to life. I'm sure you will enjoy this book as much I have!"
2,"Good service, the product just didn't work for me","I bought this item through amazon and got it very very quickly. It was a veil, and when I tried it on it just didn't look right on me.So it wasn't amazon's fault."
3,Works on Windows 7 with caveat,I also think this is the best Bridge game on a deskop. I use it on Windows 7 running a virtual Windows XP mode which is not the ideal way but it works. You have to install Virtual Windows XP which comes with Windows 7 or is available to download from Microsoft. I just wish a new version is released for Windows 7 and soon to be released Windows 8.
2,This isn't really gray!,"This eyeshadow is blue. I just can't get into it. I thought it would be gray, perfect for smoky eyes or evening eyes. It's 80's blue!"
4,What is a zooming machine?,"Cowan-Fletcher, Jane. (1993). Mama Zooms. New York: Scholastic.This picture book is a positive portrayal of a mother with a physical disability, yet does wonderful fun things with her little boy, even ""zoom him to the stars"". The father is involved and facilities their pretend activities of a racecar, airplane, and train, even a space ship. The soft, warm pastel illustrations strengthen the emotional warmth of the story. The mother is attractively dressed and coifed-even to the two earrings in each ear. The little boy wears the outfits of the pretend characters. Happiness, excitement, mother-son love exude from each illustration. This book is for children ages 5-8 and could be a bedtime story for younger children. After a long day of ""zooming"" there is a tender picture of the mother holding her sleepy son. I especially like the picture on the flyleaf- the mother in her zooming machine holding the little boy and the father holding the little boy's hand---a happy family. K"
5,Wonderful,This is a beautiful book about a mother and her son sharing their daily adventures together on her wheelchair. This book has all the magic and exuberence a children's book should contain. You won't be disappointed!
4,"Happy, nappy & free!","This book really made it possible for me to wear my hair without perms. Prior to reading it, I thought that the only natural style I could wear would be a short afro. I didn't think that there would be any versatility in going natural. However, Ms. Ferrell gives a lot of information on styling natural hair using various twisting methods. Twisting has been a lifesaver for me and allowed me to wear my hair in a variety of styles including the afro. There are also sections on locking methods, and braiding with extensions. Additionally, the author gives great information on the anatomy of hair as well as how to transition out of a relaxer/perm. I also have the books, ""No Lye"" and ""Good Hair"", both of which I like. But ""Let's Talk Hair"" gives the most comprehensive information on working with free form natural hair (as opposed to braids and locs)This is a must have for any woman with tightly curled aka nappy hair who is considering going natural."
4,Good for Beginners!,"I have long wanted to go natural. My hair tends to grow long when I leave it chemical free but I never had any clue how to care for it in it's natural state. I didn't want to be limited to braids and locs were too permanent for my taste.This book features lots of free form styles for natural african hair. The book also teaches how to look for a stylist and how to do some of the styles yourself. The only drawback is that the author did not list brand names of hair care products. She indicated what ingredients to avoid and what ingredients to look for, but I need more than that. Anyone who knows of a book that posts product info, please let us know in your review.Overall, I recommend this book and if I lived in the author's city, she'd be my stylist!"
3,Great for hair recipes and how to get out the perm...,"I was rather disappointed that there was no detail on how to actually style your hair like the all the lovely photos presented in the book. Overall though it is a good book about taking care of your hair and holds alot of important info, just not what I was looking for."
4,One of a kind,"I have been toying with the idea of going natural for a long time now, but this book has given me the confidence I needed. I am not afraid of the prospect of taking care of and grooming my own natural hair any more. In fact I'm quite excited. It also helped me to face the facts about how women of African descent view their own beauty. It is a book that is both intellectually and spirtually uplifting. I haven't come across many other books like this one. It is a must read, not only for African Americans but for African women all over the world. Now only if Miss Ferrell would open a salon in Trinidad!"
2,Nothing New,"I already wear my hair natural and was looking for tips on maintenance. I was looking for products etc., that would be more suited for my hair type...but there was nothing for me. This is primarily for those who are just starting the process of growing their natural hair. This book even talks about wearing weaves, which is not the type of help I was looking for!"
3,It was okay,"I thought the book was okay for an overall introduction to haircare, but the topics covered were broad. Great for an intro book, but if you're looking for detailed information on one hair technique or another in particular, you won't get enough detailed info here."
5,This book will make you wanna go natural!,"When I read this book I wanted to go natural right away! I've not yet gone all natural, but one day I plan to. This is a must have book for all black women!"
2,Does not dim,"The dimming feature, which accounts for a good amount of the price premium, does not work. It seems that there are just 2 discrete light settings, which switch over at a random point as you turn the dimmer. Crap."
5,"thought-provoking, educational and entertaining in one package!",This was a great series and lasted too short a time. To have the complete series in a boxed set is a treat and it's wonderful to be able to sit and savor an episode without enduring the commercials of network tv.
5,Numbers the complete series,"I love this show and was greatly disappointed when it went off the air. After getting my set I have watched the complete episodes three times now and still enjoy each of them. I would encourage anyone to make this purchase, you won't be sorry!!!!"
4,Great Show!!!,"I have not been able to watch every season so far, but what I have seen is Very Good. It's as good as I remembered it."
5,Sisterly Love,"This book is a fascinating exploration of the role of sisters in different cultures, societies, and even species! The author recounts personal stories, cultural observations, and scientific studies to demonstrate the concept of ""sister"" in a dozen different lights, challenging the meanings we associate with that word. If you are curious to find out what being a sister can really mean in a broader context than ""female sibling"", this is the book for you."
4,Pretty Good,I just recieved the helmet today. I havnt had to chance to ride with it on yet but I have tried it on. Was a little dissapointed at first. It sat really high on my head. But after I got it settled and took it on and off a few times it looks much better. Over all I am pleased with this purchase.
2,Think twice before you purchase!,"I am mind boggled that a fairly expensive and seemingly well made product such as this wasn't tested before marketing to see if the clasps actually held the briefcase closed. THEY DON'T. They are cheaply made - particularly in comparison to the rest of the case - and do not hold the case closed when there is anything as heavy as laptop in it. It is absolutely infuriating to not be able to use the handle at all, and only be able to use the shoulder strap in the 'lightest' of situations, without the bag spilling open. Buckles, straps, latches - anyting would have been more effective than these clasps. Think twice before you get this product. I'm needing to find a leatherworker or cobbler who can add buckles and straps to mine, to save it from being utterly useless."
5,Live performances spice up this reissue,"Primo, a firm in the Czech Republic, is the latest in a long line of recording companies to reissue the timeless music of Benny Goodman's trios and quartets. Goodman, pianist Teddy Wilson, drummer Gene Krupa and vibraphonist Lionel Hampton are featured on 38 tunes recorded between 1935 and 1938. This 2-CD set stands out in one respect and disappoints in another. The inclusion of some live sessions is a definite plus. The absence of any notes telling where they were recorded is a minus. Nevertheless, the live music and the price make this a good addition to any swing combo collection."
4,what happened after page 500?,"Something goes wrong with this book after page 500. Great, powerful, driving, insightful, brimming with anecdote and personal detail...up to page five hundred. After that, a downhill slide. Virtually nothing of interest, page after page of uninteresting senate detail amounting to nothing, and - the sign of a true problem - when Caro reaches such a fascinating figure as McCarthy he provides not a single bit of personal detail or biographical history. Additionally, the whole writing style becomes very unCaroesque: ungrammatical, unreadable sentences, and a complete absence of narrative drive. What happened, Bob?"
3,Not as good as I expected.,"Having read Robert Caro's other 2 books on Lyndon Johnson and having anticipated the 3rd book for so long, I was very disappointed in this one.I found it a burden toget through.Dry and lacking the vitality of the previous 2.Parts were very interesting and I certainly learnt a lot about your history of the senate but overall I think it lacked the human touch.However it won't stop me anticipating the Presidential Years because LBJ comes across as a very interesting human being and I look forward to the next installment."
5,Absolutely wonderful series.,Robert Caro's entire series on the rise of Lyndon Johnson has been fabulous. This volume meets the high standard he set with his earlier books.
5,An insightful look at both the Senate and Johnson,"Robert Caro's account of Johnson reveals him to be a determined and politically savvy person but equally fascinating is the portrayal of the Seante itself, firmly entrenched against social change in the pre-1950's years (at least, as Caro describes it).But Caro doesn't stop there. He does an excellent job of creating an in-depth analysis of Johnson, of society in those years and, finally, the Civil Rights Act. For sheer depth of research and enlightening tidbits about Johnson and his years in the Senate, this one is hard to top!"
3,Way too long,"I enjoyed Caro's first two books in the LBJ series, but I found this book to be a very tedious read. The first two books were very interesting and I finished reading them quickly. This book seemed like the never ending book. The first hundred pages or so are about the history of the Senate rather than LBJ. Much of the rest of the book spends page after page discussing how LBJ gets bills passed or defeated in the Senate. If you have read the first two books you will find this book redundant on quite a few topics. As other reviewers have said, Caro spent way too many pages building up to the 1957 Civil Rights bill and then breezed through LBJ's last few years in the Senate.In conclusion, if you are devoted to this series about LBJ, then you need to read this book, but don't expect it to be as interesting as the first two books. I hope the final book of this series is much better than this one."
3,Caro needs an editor.,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed the previous 2 parts of Caro's LBJ biography, I eagerly awaited the publication of this book. However, this time I finally lost patience with Caro's prose. He is wordy, repetitive, and follows every tangent no matter how relevant. Don't get me wrong, much of the information is fascinating, but a good editor could have trimmed at least 200 pages and helped to create a much tighter book"
3,exhaustive...and exhausting,"Caro's conceit is that every golden word of his must be retained, not edited out, so there's redundancy (repeated reminders of LBJ's restlessness, his cruelty, his physicality).The first 100 pages of the book are about Clay, Calhoun and Webster - not LBJ.There's mini bios w/in this bio, an entire chapter on Senator Richard Russell, and within that, a little bio of Russell's father! (who probably never even met LBJ).The book has some fascinating sections, to be sure, but it should have been trimmed by some 200-300 pages or so, reducing or deleting the sections tangential to LBJ.Heft may impress some, but part of good writing is also knowing what NOT to include."
5,A modern master piece,"Without a doubt, one of the greatest books I have ever read. LBJ, Dick Russell and others come to life again in this wonderful work."
5,Praise for Caro and Lang,"Stephen Lang's reading of the Master of the Senate is a model for audio books. His many, convincing voices bring the characters to life thus enriching the story. Coupled with the Caro's careful prose, the Master of the Senate audio book is a rare -- and highly 'hearable' -- treat."
5,Caro at his finest,"One of the problems with biographies is that biographers tend to create two-dimensional portraits of their subjects, or they tend to become apologists for anything and everything done by the individual in question. Caro gives us LBJ with all his finest qualities and all his warts, and also masterfully shows how the facets of his personality that made him the master of the Senate cloakroom caused him to be a boor or a lout in private. Like Caro's brilliant biography of Robert Moses, it is a rich, indeed spellbinding, work that does not lose any of its luster with repeated readings."
4,Unfortunate Bias,"Robert Caro is as capable and talented as any biographer presently being published, and ""Master of The Senate"" is a worthy successor to his two previous works on Lyndon Johnson. As in the case of most any biographer, Caro has his own views and attitudes and it is not possible to completely obscure them in his writing. However, in the two previous efforts on LBJ, Caro did a better job of apparent objectivity. In ""Master of The Senate"" Caro's Northeastern, far left, ultra liberal orientation comes through much too forcefully. This is unfortunate. A more objective offering would have made a good biography an excellent one."
4,Great book-highly recommended,"This is a wonderful book which has covers the current issue of declining amphibian populations well in regards to the pet trade, habitat loss and fragmentation, and exotic species as well as specific species such as the golden toad and california's red-legged frog. Its an adventure as well as a source of information. The only reservation I had was that it didn't cover chemicals (pesticides) or frog deformities as issues towards species loss."
3,Okay book written at a low level.,"This book is good for a first course in PDE's at the undergradute level. It teaches you very little theory and most of the problems seem to be little more than a slight change in examples. The book seems to be more aimed for engineering majors than math majors. My suggestion is if you need it for a class buy it, if you are looking for a book for reference or to learn PDE's by yourself check out something else."
5,An easy to read thorough treatment on all aspect of DE's...,"I originally purchased this text to help with my study for an undergraduate course in Partial Differential Equations and Waves. From start to finish, this book always presents the material in an easy to read and easy to understand manner.Generally, the book gives a really good understanding on the topics of solving ordinary differential equations, and then the various types of partial differential equations, such as the heat equation, where the solution methods involved can be confusing at times. The book also has a large selection of worked examples and wide ranging practise problems.The book has the effect where even if the reader is only armed with basic undergraduate calculus, it gives them a very good understanding of the material in a short time."
3,Disappointing,"After reading the Long Sun series, I excitedly anticipated reading the first book in this new series, which begins sixteen years later on the planet Blue. Sad to say, I found it not as coherent as the previous books. It might be just me, but it was confusing that our narrator, Horn, kept jumping back and forth from the past to the present. I liked it better when Horn wrote in the third person and kept himself more in the background. Maybe it's just that I don't find Horn as likeable a character as Silk, so keeping Horn out of the first person was more agreeable to me. This somewhat new writing style of Mr. Wolfe's lacked the excitement and impact of his previous books set in the Long Sun whorl."
1,Another great work ruined by Amazon's printing practices,"I am a huge Gene Wolfe fan, so despite the one star review let me state categorically this is not a negative review of his writing at all, as I have thoroughly enjoyed everyone of his written works. Rather, this review is about Amazon's deplorable practice of printing books 'On-Demand' and then trying to pass them off as the original from the publisher. If you look over this page you will not see any evidence that this book is unavailable or out of print - in fact it is currently listed as 'in-stock' - however, what you will be getting if you order it is a bootleg copy produced by amazon. The copy I received in no way matches the copy of the first book of the series I had from the publisher. Shame on you Amazon!"
3,Not Worth the Cost,Quicken 2006 Premier is not worth the cost if your are upgrading from the 2005 version. New features are nice but just not anything really impressive as with previous upgrades.
1,Incorrect Securities Matching Algorithm,"If you plan on using Quicken to track investments beware that they will assign improper prices for any security that you hold where you have more than one class of that security.When you address the issue to Intuit you might as well be talking to a monkey, in fact you probably are.I went to the extent of deciphering the Quicken OFX log which showed that my financial instituiton and quicken were downloading proper prices, but that the quicken pc software then matched those prices against the wrong security. The first respons I got just said that I could send them the problem again, the second said to go to the quicken web page to get the price, and the third told me again I could get help by either phoning them, emailing them, or doing a on-line chat. This was after my third email with detailed explanation, copies of their OFX log, and copies of their price files, all showing the problem.I'll probably try money but given its reviews I am not hopeful."
5,Quicken Premier 2006,Great integration with my online investments and bank accounts. I really never liked Quicken or Money in the old days. I can not imagine being without this program.
1,What happened to the better product,"I've used quicken on and off since it's DOS days and had to finally upgrade after combining 2 families into one. I thought I knew the product and I needed a tool to keep track of the now consolidated income and outflow of expenses. Boy was I wrong. The simplest thing - downloading your bankstatement is no longer available unless your bank supports ""Their porpriatary"" version of the .OFX file. ""Qif"" files are no longer supported as a method of exporting banking, creditcard information or investment information and transactions. I belong to a nice Credit Union that is doing it's best to save me money and refuses to add extra fees to its customers because it's forced to pay Intuit to use its style of programing. It's scarey to me that Microsoft is comeing out as a winner as a result of this but it is true and I'm going to swich over to Microsoft Money as a result."
1,Beware - Unworkable for large volume,"I had to convert from Quicken 2003 because they were sunsetting the software. Now entering a transaction in the register takes over a minute. I have a large file (40MB) and that simply does not work in Quicken 2006. After the usual couple of hours wasted with ignorant customer support, the supervisor pretty much admitted that the bells and whistles cause performance issues for large volume users but that is still a good business decision for Intuit.Anyway, thanks Intuit for stranding me and making my turn to your competitors."
1,New bugs are called features,"I recently upgraded from Quicken 2005 to Quicken Premier 2006. I am not a heavy user, but I have used Quicken for over 5 years, keeping books for two entities. Already I have discovered two very irritating changes that I consider bugs and been told they are features:Each entity uses a different check format. Previous versions remembered which check format each used. Now I find it is up to me to remember to change the printer setup from wallet checks to voucher checks or vice-versa each time I print checks. I have ruined numerous checks for my silly failure to remember each time.Report titles have an appended year and history number appended to them, like ""2006 Expendatures vs Budget - 2006:3"". It is either difficult or impossible to get rid of the ""-2006:3"" part of the title. Previously I had complete control over the report title printed in bold, large font at the top of the page. Why on earth would they take that small privilege away from us?"
2,disappointed,I upgraded from Quicken 2003. The new bells and whistles are not that impressive. I recommend it to new users but not as an upgrade.
3,Quicken Premier 2006 Personal Finance Software,"I have been using this software for almost 10 years. It is an excellent way of organizing all of your finances. However, don't believe all the charts and graphs. In some cases, the graphs don't agree with the data or numbers that it uses. As an example,if you sell one stock or mutual fund to buy another, the income/expenses graph may distort the income bar. You need to be very careful of the categories for all the transactions. Quicken will communicate with most of the banks, credit card companies and mutual funds, but not all of them. I don' know if it is a Quicken problem or the financial institution's. There were changes to last years version that I don't understand yet and it is causing some minor problems."
3,it's ok ....but....,"i've used quicken since 1984 - dos days. and what annoys me the most about it is the fact that the date doesn't update automatically any more. i've long since given up on downloading cuz i can't handle details like thousands of deletions to do. but i love it otherwise, use it daily, and have shown it to dozens of friends who all report that they use it.but i hope i never feel compelled to switch to a microsoft thing!d~"
3,Too hard!,I consider myself relatively computer literate and very anxious to get my financial house in order--therefore having every incentive to make this work--yet I found the program very complex and the support offered not at all sufficient to enable me to input all necessary data to begin tracking. I got frustrated enough to request a refund.
3,not so quick,This program is not easy to use. It takes a long time. Some of the information you want to add (name of some investment companies) you can't. I don't think I would buy it again.
4,Useful reference,"I got this for my sister who lives in California, because I already own the New England edition and find it to be one of the most useful books I've bought in the past five years. I read it before giving it to her and it's pretty interesting. Did you know that there are *three* species of Towee sparrows living in California?"
5,Very nice,My husband has used this product for over two years and he loves it. We have told others about this product.
5,Excellent,Excelente producto y promoción el tramite de la compra fue el esperado y se cumplieron todas las expectativas; estoy contento con la compra que realice.
5,My first knee wrap and it does a good job,"I started to get knee pain for lifting heavy weights in squat and leg press. I got this one and I think it does a really good job keeping my knees safer (not sure if it will keep them absolutely safe but definitely it's safer than before!). They occasionally get loose, which is annoying but I looked online for different ways to wrap a knee wrap and found that if you wrap it like an X over you knee, it'll rarely fall off. If I just wrap it around as shown in the product image it always gets unfastened and fall off.The wrap I prefer is, I start by doing one right round underneath the knee then another one tight round above the knee, then I go down diagonally once then go up diagonally again (the X shape is formed in the front of the knee), then I do the last wrap on my thigh then stuff the end anywhere seems fit. I'm thin in general, so I guess the number of possible wraps will differ based on how thick your knees and thighs are."
4,Good but read carefully,After buying some fresh organic miso at a local supermarket the search for dashi stock for miso soup led me here. Having tried it (1/2 tsp stock + 2 tbsp miso + 2 cups water) it was pretty good but I am subtracting one star for the salt and MSG content which is considerable in this product. While this will be good for those in a pinch I think I might opt to try making my own stock with shaved bonito so I can axe out the salt and MSG.
3,Good but wish it was available without MSG,"It is the missing ingredient in miso soup recipes if yours doesn't call for bonito- this has lots of salt and MSG though. It doesn't work for me unfortunately. If you're sensitive to MSG, I like the Miso seasoned with bonito and without MSG, but it can be hard to find. Alternatively use the bonito shavings and just plain miso without MSG."
1,Unhealthy,The first ingredient is salt. The second ingredient is MSG. Be aware and consume at your own risk. The picture of the product does not show the ingredients.
4,Fun Dora Book!,"If you enjoy Dora and her adventures, you will love this book. There are some great pictures in this book. It is simple and easy for my small children to understand. I would recommend it.Other great books with lots of pictures for small children that I'd recommend are...Tongue Twisters for KidsNursery Rhymes for KidsDinner, Dinner, What's for Dinner?"
2,Very little to read.,I believe there are only 9 pages with words on it. I bought it for my almost 3 year old who loves Dora. It was a cute story but it was over too soon. This would be a much better book for a one year old or possibly a child who is just starting to read on his/her own.
3,Beautiful but Tarnished,"After e-mailing this store and asking for expedited delivery, I received the set in time for Easter. It is a truly beautiful set, however after washing it in the dishwaster, it came out tarnished after only one use. I had to use silver polish to clean it. I e-mailed Reed & Barton and was asked to send them a piece of the set. They acted as though they hadn't a clue as to why this happened. Note: I have had a William Rogers set for almost 50 years, using it several times a year and cleaning them in the dishwasher. No problem!"
4,Solid storytelling in a fantasy world,"Writers who try to do fantasy don't always get the beginning of the story right. This series didn't have that problem and the first volume of Claymore has just the right mix of violence and mystery to draw in the average reader. By the end of the few too short chapters here you have figured out that Claire is a not quite human mercenary who is hired through a shadowy group to defeat shapeshifting demons which invade towns and devour the humans they can catch.The story doesn't have many twists in this first volume, but it has enough to build the mystery of who are the Claymores and what is the mysterious organization that creates and sends them out.I recommend this quite often to people I run into at the few bookstores near me. The writing at this point in the story is far better than any American comic book I've tried to read in the last decade."
3,"Worth a read, not a look","After reading five of the books from this manga series, I can tell this will be a fairly interesting plot line and I look forward to getting through the rest of it. However, the art leaves something to be desired. It's mainly the human faces I have trouble with... the main characters are done well enough, but the rest all look mildly deformed or indistinguishable. On the whole, most the human forms are not very proportional and the artist seems to have trouble with foreshortening."
3,"A good ""Song"" but...","A good ""Song"" but who can say that it's better than Ferrie's with Walter again and the VPO? The sound also is not of first class."
3,"Hard cover but small, short, and sweet","This little book covers 15 notorcycles including two racing models. Nice quality paper, great pictures but very little info and many,(most), models are not included. Might make a good gift for someone that is only mildly interested in BMW bikes. If your looking for a reference book, look elsewhere."
4,Pocket Size Encyclopedia,A little pocket size encyclopedia on BMW motorcycles with pictures and descriptions of the significant models. It is written in the same format as Wilson's The Encyclopedia of the Motorcycle.
2,Buyer Beware,"This is a small book at 42 pages and the pages dimensions of 5x3 inches. The information is of good content, but a short 20 minute read. Over priced for the size and depth of information . Buyer beware."
1,Poor quality,"The first time we put this flatware in the dishwasher it came out with several water spots that would not come off by rubbing. Thinking that it could have something to with the hard water, we used electrasol tablets with jet dry and rewashed them. Once again there were stubborn spots on the flatware. Since rubbing would not take the spots off, my wife soaked them in soapy water for an hour or so and came back to the flatware having rust eating through parts of the flateware (especially the butter knives). Poor quality flatware considering Gorham makes it."
3,Fine for folk style birds,"In response to the criticism of this book I felt obliged to say that this book and Hillman books are fine books for a folk style of bird carving (or decoy making). These are not to be compared to fine detailed pattern and instructional books. Hillman's are based on simple carving techniques and no woodburning, ie. ""smoothies"". This is not a bad place for beginner carvers to start, it will help you get started and have a few patterns to try out. Generally, there are no painting instruction in these pattern books. You may want to try your own or pickup a painting book as well."
3,good for more experienced beginners,"In deference to the first post, this book has been on the market for 20+ years. In the two books I own, Mr. Hillman specifically encourages the carver to do the research on the bird. Research is very easy via the internet. What Mr. Hillman provides is information not unlike his peers of the time,nor his predecesors in writing about carving. This book is not step by step as there is some expectation that one knows how to do basic carving in the round and one knows how to handle a knife and sharpen their tools. One must read his introductions to understand the books. Without doing the research, the carver may end up short."
2,Gold overlay is cheap,"While these earrings are pretty, the ""gold"" overlay wore off after two wearing. This is JUST wearing during the day, not sleeping with them on or showering. If you want a one-wear earring, this is fine. If you want something that shows quality AND lasts, keep looking."
4,thought provoking Read for fans of Sci-Fi,"This book was a very engrossing read, suspenseful with a very unexpected conclusion.It is not of the super hi tech all technology is good branch of sci-fi, its of the other branch that asks us to consider what impact advanced technology will have on our humanity.Interesting questions, disturbing answers."
3,Super Reader,"Earth society is falling apart, so Ryan decides to take a ship full of people and leave. The journey has its own problems of engineering and psychology."
3,A priceless epic in film and WWII history in itself.,"It is often difficult for the average modern audience to endure such films.These propaganda films, especially ones as succesful as ""Wake Island"" are crammed with predictability and politically incorrect stereotypes.Since PC is BS, as far as I'm concerned the film makers did there best with what little resources and information they had. Painfully typical 1940's special effects, and the usual batch of Chinese actors cast as Japanese. ""Manzanita Casting"" was apparently missed by the production team.You can read more about the films technical issues and interesting history on IMDB, but enjoy it for what it is with a grain of salt and in its historical context.It made me want to be a Marine. It is doubtless thousands too joined upon its 1942 theatrical release.A must for historians with great footage of rarely seen USMC F4F-3 Wildcats.In the words of R. Lee Ermy- ""Semper Fi!"""
3,Classic WWII Propaganda Film,"One of the very first WWII films produced during the war to showcase American heroism. Stylized, fictionalized docudrama, with names of the heroes changed to protect their anonymity. Since all Americans on Wake Island were killed or taken prisoner, somewhat remarkable that the movie is even this close to the basic facts of the battle. Although Wake Island was a total defeat, at least they went down fighting and took some of the enemy with them. After Pearl Harbor that served as some motivation to the American public, inspiration of an eventual victory, and an advertisement for War Bonds. If you're interested in WWII films of the period, this one must be seen."
5,Wake Island,One of the great movies of 'defeat' done in the 1940s to celebrate the heroism of the American forces overrun by the Japanese in the Pacific in the early months of WW2. It is very much 'fictionalised' and introduces the stock characters and heroic gestures that fill Hollywood war movies up to the 1980s about. An insight into the mood in which WW2 was perceived at the time. A precious piece of history!
3,In The Days Following Pearl Harbor,"Wake Island details the battle for the island in the days immediately following Pearl Harbor. Wake Island was a small, flat piece of nothing in the middle of the Pacific that had strategic importance. When Japanese bombers began attacking, there wasn't much the American Marines stationed there could do, although the battle they put up in the face of hopeless odds was remarkable. Needless to say, the emphasis is on the action here, as it should be, and it is efficiently and effectively played out. There's a number of familiar character actors that give the movie a comfortable feel. The film is competently made, and history lovers and war buffs will no doubt find it entertaining enough."
4,Wake Island,"A great movie for the 1940's. Lots of propaganda though, but America needed it then. Like my parents said of that era, ""we knew we had to win, because if we didn't, we would have lost our country."""
3,Mixed feelings,"The novel is flawed in many ways. The violent climax at the end was a little too predictable, and the conversations at times sounded more like lectures from some music professor desperately trying to be hip, or like an author trying to recreate the casual banter of people from subcultures he never experienced.However the books true saving grace (apart from some really interesting information here and there) was the very idea of a famous rock musician who has no public persona. Anonymity as a means of generating ""hype"" - and hiding from the world and protecting one's ""real"" life. The concept is fascinating."
2,Poor,"A cartoonish and predictable novel that will especially disappoint fans of Kosinski's purer, more original efforts."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Ok... What the HELL was that!?! Seriously, not only did someone spend time writing this piece of trash, but they actually got some recognizable names to star in it!? The description sounded great, but the movie was not. I really have to question the competency of the company that would make such a thing. AVOID!"
2,Minimal Light Duty Sewing Kit,"The case is is best part of the kit, although I'll just throw the ALICE clip away. It should have some larger needles, heavier thread. I was expecting something like what I was Issued when I entered the military in 1967. This is far inferior to that. This is more suited for a debutante to patch her panties with it than to make any field repairs to field equipment, uniforms, outdoor clothing, etc.. I'll have to supplement the kit with some additional needles, pins, safety pins and heavier thread."
2,same ol' same ol',"saw these guys once, so I gave the album a try. not so much of anything. I think I would rather listen to Blink 182 (and they aren't too hot!)"
4,Enjoyable and informative,"I suppose I was the perfect candidate for this book because I am fairly well acquainted with the plays involved but didn't know much beyond them. The narrative is quite well told and interesting, I was never bored with the purely historical aspects, the only parts that get tiresome are the reciting the divergences between actual event and Shakespeare's version. In some cases it was just too much information for my poor brain.But I am very glad to have found out more about all of these kings and queens and the major figures around them. So many historians are not good storytellers, oddly enough, I guess they don't know what interests normal humans, but in any event, Norwich is a good storyteller, and I'm glad he wrote this book."
2,Dramatists should not try to be historians,"I was prepared to like this book, and really had no problems with the earlier chapters. However, the latter sections concerning the wars of the roses, and Richard III in particular, are nonsense from a historical perspective. Norwich must have flipped through a few scholarly works and decided that including footnotes and cititions would be adequate. The problem is that he tends to ignore the credibility of the sources he cites, perhaps feeling that anybody living within a couple of hundred years of the events in question would be a credible and objective source. In the case of Richard the 3rd, many other people have made the same mistakes (i.e. taking Thomas More and John Morton as reliable sources of information). However, most of these people don't embarrass themselves by writing a book that uses such sources and citiations.Looks like Poor Richard is never going to get a break!"
1,don't make any purchases from this dealer,"Never sent product,every time I requested deliv. date he would move it further along. I finally cancelled and my credit card made good the refund."
1,Disappointing performance,"This was cheap, the ad copy made it sound wonderful so I bought it for my daughter so she could work with her laptop away from the main computer in her three bdrm rambler home. This Linksys WPC11 Card is so weak that it only works while in the same room with the router. If you live in a one room apartment this may serve you well but forget about settling into your favorite easy chair in the living room if your router is in the other end of the house. I give it one star only because it was cheap and I apparently got exactly what I paid for."
4,so far so good,"I bought this item for another friend as a gift, so I haven't used myself but I do know from what he has said, that it was easy to install, great range from the wireless sport and it has good speed. The only cons perhaps is that the card cannot be completely fitted into the laptop, I mean that a couple of centimeters of the card always stays out like sort of an antena. If you are not so picky with this type of thing I recommend you to buy this item.Arturo"
1,Be Warned!,"Anyone about to purchase a Linksys product should be well warned:Linksys customer service and tech support is ABYSMAL!In fact it's so bad, it's worse than none at all. I spent over six hours on the phone attempting to get help with this product, coming away empty handed in the end. Rude, ineffective, uninformed and rude again is my assessment. I am a first-time Linksys customer and will probably never do it again."
2,It was cheap at least,"I couldn't get the damn thing to work, but it may have been a problem on my computers part. I sold it to my boss, and I haven't heard back from him on whether it worked for him."
5,great at this price,Paid 9.99 and received my PCMCIA card in 4 calendar days. I was up and running in 5-10 minutes unencrypted. Setting up WEP security was straightforward and took about another 5-10 minutes. Works great in my P III Thinkpad.
5,Works like a champ,"It was cheap, easy to install and worked right off the bat. I actually picked up 3 surrounding networks in my neighborhood."
1,prosductnot received,"I have already advised that the product was partially received, Main part, the PCMCiA card amd installation disc not in package. This is the second notice re the product sent.AlvinTHIS IS THE THIRD TIME I AM ADVISING YOU THAT THE ORDER WAS INCOMPLETE. ONLY THE ADAPTER FOR A PC WAS SENT, NOT THE NETWORK CARD. WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET SOME SATISFACTION????????"
3,Conservative Principals,"I think having Conservative thought is important to have and to protect but there are times for survival in third world countries there needs to be government to help, even though Western Civilization may or may not appreciate that because we don't like people coming here that are different and it's problematic and that's why it is wrong having them come in this country because half of the people that are here are illegal and there is constant debate. I am personally overwhelmed and disappointed that this is happening."
5,My son's favorite game!,I spent some time finding this game. I made the mistake of thinking Age of Empire III would be better than II. My son did not like that version and insisted in II. I also had him try the online version with the same results.
5,"History that's great reading, and interesting","This captures the sense of ""being there"", and pulls the reader into Appalachia history, like reading a good novel.Concisely edited for maximum impact, without loss of content.(a fine balancing act by the editors, that took over a decade to compile!)This is so engaging, tha I have bought several as gifts.Outstanding documentation, and great storytelling abound.Reference, coffetable, and personal library uses are a must."
5,"Exciting Overview of Appalachian Culture, Music, Literature & Religion","As a undergrad who is finishing up my studies in History with a minor in Appalachian Studies at Appalachian State-I will go on and get my master's in Appalachian & Bluegrass studies .This is a well-written resource that is full of any information of the Appalachia's. From literature, religion, mountain music, conservation, culture, movies, Foxfire,-more than you can digest in one reading.The author breaks each catagory down in sections that deal with a specific topic. This is a must for your library. This is a thick volume that should have been broken down into 4 volumes. the book is very bulky and heavy. I guess all the education and reading does weigh a lot!"
5,The Perfect Bag,"This is the PERFECT bag! Professional yet trendy and great for all the daily work necessities as well as the weekend getaway items. Amazing quality, detail and great at holding its shape. This is the must have ""it"" bag."
4,good intermediate yoyo,"if you dont know how to do bind return or use a counterweight, dont buy this. this isn't a beginner yoyo. decent sleep time and does pretty good with string tricks and helping me master freehand tricks. not bad overall."
3,GET A WARENTY,"After getting my yo-yo, I immediately opened it and soon began playing with it. It was incredibly fun and was very entertaining. It did not specify how tightly you are supposed to tighten the yo-yo so, I over tightened it and it broke on the fourth day."
1,Disappointed it didn't sleep like they said it would!,"I bought this yo-yo for my 10 year old son because he needed a yo-yo that was a good sleeper. This one was advertised as such but, when we got it it didn't sleep at all! Also, I have not been able to return it because there was no info on returning. I was very disappointed with the whole experience!"
5,Marvellous and memorable,"This beautifully written and crafted book is a revelation. It's not merely a retelling of legends about the selchies, (grey seals) wonderful as these stories are. It also describes Thomson's experiences as he travels around coastal Ireland, the Hebrides and Orkneys. He evokes for us characters and communities as they were in the 1950's. The way Thomson captures the language and cadences of the voices of the people he meets is remarkable. Reading this is like hearing poetry. The echo stays with you like the song of the seals themselves. Remarkable."
5,Amazing,"Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R1 and R2 is one of the greatest anime I have ever seen. The story is great, the characters are amazing, and there is never a boring part of the anime. I recommend this to anyone interested in anime. Truly a masterpiece."
5,Code Geass,Bought for my daughter. She can't get enough of this. I see her watching it over and over. Guess I know what to buy her from now on!!
5,Code Geass,"This series has a wonderful ending to a great story, it is inventive , spellbinding and grand I recommend it to everyone."
4,Meet Miley Cyrus Cd,"I really liked this Cd. It arrived in time for christmas, and my Grand daughter was so pleased to get it.. It was in new condition.. I loved how I got the free shipping by spending so much.. I am real pleased.."
5,My six year loved it,I bought this CD for my six year old daughter. She plays it all the time. I put it on her MP3 player.
5,Singing along with Hannah,My 4 and 5 year old love putting the cd in there karaoke machine and singing along! Has great songs to sing along to!
4,A Very Good Second Album,"Miley/Hannah produce some catchy songs on this great follow-up to the first album. In many ways this two-disc set is better than the first Hannah Montana album (there is no filler from other groups or singers) and there are many age-appropriate songs that adults will find themselves singing along to. They have included so many songs that not every song is a winner (some of the slow ones are boring) and songs that Miley wrote show that she is still learning how to songwrite. She also oversings a couple tunes. But overall this is very good, well produced and recommended."
4,Great CD,"My 10/11yr old...loves this CD. There are some great tracks on this CD. One of the songs especially, has a very positive message."
4,Hannah Montana,I really injoyed both CD's. I think this Cd set is very good for young people and people who like to stay in touch with young people. My husband really like it too.
1,I Probably Won't Buy It,"I don't have this, and I probably, will never consider buying it. She has all these songs about being yourself, but she's the one wearing a wig being someone else. I also think G.N.O. is kinda inappropriate. Like ""Hey boy.Don't you wish you could have been a good boy .Try to find another girl like me, boy""? So, its like she's getting back at her boyfriend by going out and flirting with someone else, then rubbing it in her face?Just horrible"
5,GREAT CD MILEY CYRUS!!!,"My daughter is 12 and loves you!!! What a positive role model you are and I tell you, such nice fun music for her to listen to! There are other singers out there and some of there songs are such downers. Your songs are fun and uplifting! I thankyou!!! A+"
1,horrable,"Miley Cyrus is just another pop singer want to be. She can't sing live at all, her voice is awful. Her song lyrics remind me of random stuff I used write when I was three. I could write a bunch of random words, eat it, throw it back up, and it would be 10X better then her song lyrics. So many people want to be famous and the only reason she's famous is because of her dad, if he wasn't there she'd be a nobody. She is the next Brittany Spears, except she can't sing. The only reason I'd give her money is to shut her up. She has the musical talent of a newborn baby but I admit she is a better actress then she is a singer, that's still not saying much."
5,I Call It The Britney Spears Effect,"Miley is constantly hassled & criticized, just as Britney Spears was upon her debut. It's ""cool"" to hate Miley Cyrus. Fortunately for unbias people such as myself, we can look past the facades and opinions of others and see that this girl has talent. She may not have the strongest voice, but it is a good voice, it's unique, and she has good range. The songs are all fun and upbeat, very catchy. And what's most impressive is that at the age of 14, she wrote 8 out of the 10 songs on the Meet Miley disc, while Britney can't even write more than 3 songs on her past few albums. So props for her.I look forward to Miley's future, and hopefully she'll make dance music one day."
4,One of the few CDs the whole family can listen to in the car.,The songs are catchy without being repetitive and annoying. I thought I would hate the CDs but they really grew on me quickly and I don't mind listening to them and it keeps the kids happy!
5,Wow so much beter than the first.,"Hey Miley hats off to ya. Your doing a great job. Please don't end up like the other bimbos in hollywood. Seems like you and hilary duff have your heads screwed on right. and your music says it all. keep it up very entertaining. The cd is great good songs that reach me and mean something to me, just like everyone. you people will love it."
2,Didn't receive the correct disk,The second album was a Keith Urban CD rather than part two of the HM album. I was very disappointed!
3,Disney knows how to make a great product,"Miley Cyrus(Hannah Montana) is back after the incredible sucess of her tv show, i'm old but sometimes i see her show and i always have a good time, is probaly the best kid show Disney ever made, even better than Lizzie Mcguire.I think Miley is doing a great job so far being a good role model for the kids and didn't nothing stupid to put her career is dangerous.I really hope Miley breaks the Disney girls model and don't become one more Vanessa Hudgens, Hilary Duff,Lindsay Lohan and some others.I hope after the Hannah Montana hype ends she become a country singer, i saw her singing with her dad on ""Dancing With The Stars"" and she can probaly have a good future on country music, it's all in her hands.The cd is cool, some songs are really fun and the kids will love it."
4,A Promising Future,"Alright, so I was surfing through the Top Sellers here at our beloved Amazon and saw how highly this album was ranking in sales. Disney records aren't normally so successful, and I succumbed to curiousity and gave it a listen. God help me, it was catchy and I heard a few songs worthy of top 40 radio. In a nut, it left Britney's last three albums in the dust. This young lady has a very bright future, provided she doesn't follow in the footsteps of Britney or Lindsey. So my advice is this: pay attention. This girl is going places."
2,"MILEY : ""IM KEEPING MY BABY""","Okay, dont even buy this. It doesnt even sound like her.They have messed up her voice so much.She wants to be hilary duff and DISNEY SAYS she is the next hilary duff but Hilary duff didnt have her voice changed soo much like this girl.And that doesnt even look like her on the cover??she looks fatter on it, though shes not!she lip sings in concerts, this cd is nothing new.Gosh, only people who are gonna like this are little 12-14 year old girls who wanna be a pop star. this album SUCKS.yes the songs, or atleast a few, are good, THE LYRICS but her voice, no, just no.I am not hating miley cyrus, I think shes pretty and all, but her voice is edited so badly.listen to her sing on the show, with no music, as miley, then listen to her ""sing"" as hannah. It changes.Gosh. she is gonna be out of style in a year or so.Cause there is something fishy about her. I just know it.,"
2,Not for little kids,"This album is too rocky for smaller kids under 10. I have this album along with the first hannah montana album. and kids at my house will only be allowed to listen to the first one. There are 3 songs from the show that are on this album that are ok, but that is all. then Miley has the song called ""I miss you"" and it's ok..For any kids here at my house, i prefer mellow music until they are 11 or 12. the smaller kids under 10 or so will not be listening to this album."
1,Meet Miley Cyrus,[...]This girl is not cut out to be a singer. Why? Cause she's VERY VERY - Get this - ***AVERAGE*** at it! I could outsing this mega-no talent any day of the week. And I could write a song that would make her look mighty stupid.The only real thing I like is that she's kinda funny especially on HM and I think that she's a very good role model for other girls her age and younger.Cover Art: F+ (Looks phony as the next)Songwriting: D- (One In A Million is one of the only decent songs that displays anything interesting)Vocal: D+Vocal Emotion: FLength: F- (30+ minutes too long)Overall: F+1 star (*LOL*).
2,I was disapointed,When I listened to the sample of this album I thought it would be great. But it is not. The Miley Cyrus CD has some good songs exept for song 2 and GNO. I am not getting any more Hannah Montana Cds because of this!
2,Miley Cyrus,"OK, im 15 years old && i dont really like Miley Cyrus. As hannah montana she's ok. i know its the same person, but as hannah, she does whats she's supposed to do as a pop star: lip-synch, do concerts, and make cds. Her as Miley Cyrus is unnecessary. We already know your name by the credits on the show. Disney Channel thinks all of their stars should have their own CDs, which is stupid. She is a wannabe rockstar, avril lavigne, everlife copycat. Real singers didn't get their record deals by using the little bit of ""connections"" their father has, or by singing to the producers of their tv show. I know not all real music has to vulgar and R-rated, but come on, now. Ashley Tisdale makes REAL music. You can hear her personality through her songs and she's a real actress. Miley Cyrus is a manufactured phase that will be out by next year or so I hope.P.S. im so mad that she's sold more CDs than alot of other excellent singers."
2,boring music.,"it sounds like angry gymnastics music. you can even tell she doesnt sing live, only when she speaks to the crowd is when they turn on her mic."
3,"Was pleased with 'Hannah', didnt care so much for 'Meeting Miley'","Hannah Montana 2 is a good soundtrack. Even better than it's original. But the Meet Miley Cyrus album wasnt at all what I expected. I only like 2 songs, ""See You Again,"" and ""East Northumberland High."" But the Hannah Montana 2 Soundtrack is amazing. I love every song, especially ""Rock Star""!!!"
2,eh its ok,"this cd is ok, not that great. ive heard every song on it, and i only like about 3 of them. shes not that great of a singer but shes alright. little kids will like it like its a 10 yrold cd."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!,This CD is very different from the first one. I think she shows her vocal range really well. The Miley songs are fun to listen to because they have a very different vibe then the Hannah songs. I listen to this CD alot and would highly recomend it!
4,This Singer is Blasting Off,"Now Hannah Montana, from this mom's point of view, is just the sweetist thing. She has a TV show, is a decent singer, wholesome personality (so-far) and is coming to the Boston area. Every radio station that I turn on, has a contest where you can win Hannah Montana tickets to see her in person - and from what the disc jockeys are saying, they (the radio stations) are just overwhelmed with calls hoping to get their children tickets.My son (younger) enjoys her, my daughter (who is much older) would have loved her way back then. I've listened to her music and it's sweet and fun and full of dance energy. Kids love her. I think you will too."
4,Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus,It was a gift for our granddaughter & she loves the music & Amazon had the best price.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY,My son recently received this toy as a gift. The water dyes were NOT washable. I tried to clean out the stains immediately after use as directed and they did not come out. Even with stain remover. Very vivid stains! Both kids outfits were ruined.It also says the water is brightly colored and it is not. You can barely tell that the water is a color unless you hit someone with it. If your kids plan on changing into something you don't mind staining every time they want to play with this toy then it would be okay!
5,nurseor,mazing kitchen cures. I think it's a great book. It has helped my son with his son as he cant' afford a doctor visit every time the child gets a minor illness. like a cold. The suggestions really work.
4,interesting stuff,"haven't read the whole book, skimmed through it. it's a good reference book to have around the house. lots of quirky things to use to cure things or to even clean with that you would've never thought to use before."
4,It's quirky,"It's quirky, with some odd uses for everyday things, that we wouldn't have thought to use.Like Pepto Bismol for eczema. Or peroxide to get rid of warts.Who knew Vodka wasn't just for drinking. Or more uses for baking soda then you knew before.Give it a read. Have fun with it."
3,Too much of a good thing.,"It is very similar to other Joey Green book that I purchased in the same order, and I wish I knew that in advance."
4,Great price and good quality!,"Can't have enough of this stuff lying around when doing any type of wiring project. I gave it a 4 stars because the packaging is a bit too small and warps the plastic from being curled over but other than that, this stuff is great!"
3,Dressed To Kill,"Of the classic Kiss output in the 1970's, Dressed To Kill belongs to the weaker side of the releases. But this isn't becuase of the music really. The only real complaint about the music is the complete and total lack of energy, esecially among Peter Criss' drumming. There just isn't in life in there, I mean listen to 'Two Timer.' But the real problem lays in the production. It's just flat as most original Kiss records are, but this one however seems to be worse than the rest. Just plain dull.Tracks like 'Room Service' 'Ladies In Waiting' and the killer Ace Frehley cut 'Getaway' are all classic kiss. The same can be said for 'She' and the groups first hit, and signature track 'Rock And Roll All Nite' which closes out the album.Overall it's not a bad album at all, it just feels very juvinile, which is to be expected from cock rockers like Kiss. It's a very enjoyable album, to just let rock, though it's ages behind the self-titled debut, and Rock N' Roll Over."
3,Another KISS classic!,"Dressed to Kill is the 3rd release from KISS & it features some great songs like: ""Ladies in Waiting"" ""Rock Bottom"" ""Anything For My Baby"" ""She"" and of course the Rock and Roll National Anthem ""Rock and Roll All Nite"" I never really cared for the other songs on this CD, for example: ""Two Timer"" one of my least favorites from Gene. ""Getaway"" sung by Peter is a good song but it seems to be missing something IMO. ""C'mon and Love Me"" alot of people love this song but it doesn't really do anything for me, the Alive! version is better. The whole CD only last 29:57 but it's still worth picking up."
5,Best KISS CD Ever,"This is the best they ever released. Its overall theme of classic pop metal/rock will never be surpassed, from ""Rock and Roll All Night"" to ""Ladies in Waiting"". A must buy for ANY rock fan."
3,Rock and roll anthem,"This album features the song ""rock and roll all night"" a tune that became a rock and roll anthem. However, the cd features songs that better display KISS' simplistic, yet powerful song writing ability.I like ""c'mon and love me"", and ""rock bottom"" which can also be found on the bands' ALIVE! album"
3,"Half is great ,other half weak","The 3rd Kiss album sounds like it was kind of rushed. 2 songs were already taken from the pre-Kiss Wicked Lester and those 2 are some of the better songs. The sound quality is a million times better thann Hotter than Hell which helps alot. Rock Bottom and She are probably the best on here. Getaway,Ladies in Waiting, Anything for my Baby, Two Timer and Room service are really throwaways. Oh yeah, it also contains Rock and Roll all Night which is kind of popular."
3,"Good, not Great","If there was ever an album for KISS completists only, it would be ""Dressed To Kill."" Nothing really stands out as exceptional, ""Come On And Love Me"" leading a small pack of good songs as well as ""She,"" and ""Rock and Roll All Night."" So much of this album is borderline camp, though, that it's hard to really get attached to any of it. Silly songs like ""Room Service"" and ""Ladies In Waiting"" are catchy enough but the lyrics are so pointless that the songs go by without much notice from the listener. The production's a little better but the lost songs on this album probably deserved their fate."
3,Not that great but pretty good,"This is probably the weakest of the frist 3 kiss records...but good songs on here like Two Timer, C'mon and Love Me, She, and Rock n' Roll All Night are the best on this albam...Get it if your a Kiss fan"
2,Very raw,A very raw product from what was then a very raw band - looking back it's funny to think how my perceptions have changed. Some of these songs are not much better than garage band quality really. And Paul Stanley's vocals are really quite awful at times. One for the completists I think - the sound of a band still very much working out what it wanted to sound like.
5,Dressed to Rock!,"Dressed to Kill is a classic album and one ofthe best. It has a cleaner production sound thanHotter than Hell which sounded more raw. I thinkthe songs are better. Room Service, Two Timer,Getaway, Love Her All I Can are classics and oneof them should've been on Alive but...? I must'veplayed this 1,000 times when I first bought it.Great album cover too! One of my favorite albums!"
4,Rock Bottom,"Excellent release by Kiss. What was this their first of what 30? It is good. Lady's in waiting, Room Service etc. Old old school rock."
4,Gettin Heavier,This is a great album.Released just before Alive.The band was beginning to produce their heavier sound.Much heavier than the first two albums but not like the others after alive but I do recommend buying this album/CD.
3,it's true i tell you,"Here's a pointless little piece of trivia: Ace Frehley's solo in ""She"" starts out exactly identical to the guitar solo in the Doors' ""Five To One"". This album is only good on the songs you know from the first Alive! album.The others are standard Kiss filler."
3,KISS Can Do Better,"This is the worst KISS album.I am big fan of KISS, but this album is weak.If you want to listen real cool albums buy ""Creatures Of The Night"" , ""Revenge"" or ""Destroyer"""
2,this album is okay.,"This cd is okay. It isn't as good as KISS ""KISS"" or KISS ""creatures of the night"", or ""alive"" but it is okay. I am puzzled as to why so many of these mediocre kiss albums get 5 star reviews. This album is rockin good fun but nothing as special or as epic early Rush or Judas Priest albums. If you like KISS or rock you will enjoy this album, i happen to think Kiss is an okay band and this album is just okay. if you want to get into Kiss, start with the self titled, creatures of the night, Alive 1 and 2, or Love gun. Lick it up is pretty cool too(though mediocre)but still good fun music. I gave it 3 star instead of 5 because the songs are very simple and thrown together for the most part, but a handful are worthy to listen to...hell some people may even like the crappy songs...i know i do at times hahaha. kiss is cool!"
5,KISS At their best,forget what you've heard this is Kiss's best lp. Every song is enjoyable.you can't stop listening to this album once you have it on.The classic Rock and Roll all night is here but also Anything For My Baby and Love her all I can get top marks. The Ace written and Peter sung Getaway is a rare gem and hey Two Timer is Gene Simmons.
5,KISS at thier absolute Best!!!,"I was a KISS fan at the age of 7, but I didn't actually own this album until I was in my late twenties. Of course I had heard many of the songs on it, but either live or on compilation LPS. I was never in a hurry to own it, as I figured the songs I had never heard were just throwaways.DRESSED TO KILL, is without a doubt, my absolute favorite KISS album. I love every single song ( except Two Timer ) and that cannot be said for any other KISS album I own. Most of the songs clock in at under three minutes, and I often wonder if that was by design or by accident. My favorite KISS song of all time, ROCK BOTTOM, is on this LP. Every single song has a catchy riff that I remember, and I find myself singing along with nearly all of them. Again, I can't say that about any other KISS LP.I cannot believe that this album is as underrated as it is, but I guess it's all a matter of opinion."
3,It's O.K.,"This is another one of those albums I found at a local Wal Mart for 5 bucks. This had the first hit single from the band KISS in Rock N Roll All Nite, and the last album before they got really big with Alive. This was the third album released by KISS in a 13 month period, and this I would say is the worst of them, as it isn't as memorable tunes as the self titled debut, nor the kitsch appeal of Hotter than Hell. Nevertheless, it is still a strong album in its own right, and a near bankrupt KISS had enough material for Alive- either the live album would succeed or KISS would call it a day. Then after another trio of solid studio material (Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over and Love Gun) they recorded Alive II for the holiday season. A good look at the band KISS before they became icons and popular worldwide. I don't know if this could be considered a sell out, even though Rock n Roll All Nite was their first charting single. It's a good, not great, album."
5,"Awesome CD, KISS at their Best!","I think this is KISS' best CD. It's one of my all time favorite KISS CDs. All the songs here are raw and not over-produced. I can listen to every song on this CD and not skip one. It just rocks from start to finish. This is a very good demonstration of good, rockin' early KISS. Ace's guitars sound really good and Peter's drumming is solid. This is when they were young and hungry, before things really started taking off for them, so i love it. BUY IT!"
3,A good assortment,"The two best songs, Room Service and Ladies In Waiting make it worth buying. The CD skip comes in handy for most of the other songs."
4,"""ROCK BOTTOM! Girl you know you oughta treat me good.""","Dressed To Kill contains probably the band's biggest hit, Rock n Roll All Night, but there are several Kiss Klassics on this album that never appeared on any compilation or were rarely played live. I love the better known songs like She, Rock Bottom and C'mon And Love Me, but I also dig Gene's Two Timer & Ladies In Waiting as well as Paul's Anything For My Baby & Love Her All I Can. Ace's cool guitar playing is sprinkled throughout the album, especially on C'mon And Love Me and Love Her All I Can (great solo!). I wouldn't put this album in their top three (Destroyer, R&R Over, Love Gun), but it is worth buying."
4,street somgs,"People actually used to think Kiss was a complete gimmick and they couldn't play their instruments-as in totally illiterate. Of course I knew as a little kid that didn't make any sense and now it is preposterous; the guitar syncopations in the verses of 'Ladies in Waiting,' the tight vocal harmonies, songwriting that captures a suspension of reality that only true masters possess. That chorus in 'C'mon and Love Me' being particularly dramatic; plus to really prove their point of -I mean they're wearing regular clothes here- there are even acoustic guitars. Really like how nonchalant this record feels, like you are inside their loft on 42nd street."
4,I LOVE THIS GAME!,"I PLAY THIS GAME WITH MY 12 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF THE SHOWS THAT ARE BACK FROM MY ERA. MY DAUGHTER PREFERS ""SCENE IT JUNIOR."" EITHER WAY, THE ""SCENE IT"" LINE ARE FUN TO PLAY. THANKS FOR THE SUPER FAST SHIPPING!!"
1,Not for orthodox Christian Evangelicals,"Book was required reading in my seminary class. It doesn't belong in true biblical based spiritual formation. It has the similar names but the power source is SELF not Holy Spirit. It sounds good till you read these sources and examples used by other cults to empty your mind, and having the clay tell the potter what shape to become all not biblical. It quotes buddist, worldly philosophers and other liberal feminist and New Age followers. Not for immature easily influenced followers of One True God and His Son Jesus Christ who will not understand view of infused vs. imparted righteousness. Readers should pick up on the catholic views of work based santification and righteousness and the author quotes from Pope."
4,Small but insightful,"John Westerhoff's book on spirituality for preachers and teachers can be read very slowly, a section at a time, and reflected upon. Westerhoof follows a classical approach to spirituality, but he is also able to relate the discipline whose ministry involves teaching and preaching. This is a small volume, but is very insightful. There might be a temptation to read it in one sitting, but that would impede the reader from savoring the insights obtained by reflection. Each chapter is broken down into sections and each section offers material for reflection and prayer."
3,Confortable but extremely heavy!,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
5,Bruno Walter,This is an excellent CD....we heard parts of it on a local classical radio station and knew that we wanted it...hard to find because it is out of publication...... we highly reccommend it....
1,Beware of What?,It says right on the cover of the cd: Bruno Walter REHEARSES Beethoven. What part of rehearsal did the previous reviewer not understand? Did you think you were going to get all of those Beethoven symphonies complete on one CD? HELLO!
3,BEWARE!!!!!!!! This is a REHEARSAL!!!!!,"Beware: This is only a CD of Bruno Walter REHEARSING these symphonies with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra. This means that, rather than hearing the symphonies themselves, you will hear the conductor humming and talking to the orchestra as they play selected sections of the symphonies. If you're a professional musician who's looking for this sort of thing, then order it. If you want the symphonies themselves, there is a CD of Bruno Walter conducting symphonies 5 and 7, and there are other Bruno Walter CDs."
1,Talking Heads,"I bought this DVD hoping it would have some good information for my Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) club members or a high school senior internship class. The film consists of male and female representatives talking back and forth to disburse information in a very boring format. I've sat through a number of not-so-interesting films for educational purposes, but I couldn't bear sitting through this one. If you need a job, save your money; don't waste it on a video like this one."
1,False advertising?,I have not ordered this but the image in the picture is of a veggie clip. I have one of these at home. That is in no way shape or form a gravel vaccuum. I am not sure where the mistake is. It might be the wrong picture or it might be the wrong product description. Not sure which but it needs to be fixed.
1,Someone please fix this...,"This is not a Gravel Vacuum, the picture is a Vegi clip, So, I dont know if I'm, going to get the vegi clip, or the gravel vacuum. Needs to be fixed, this has been like this for a long time.."
5,Chichen-Itza Pizza is Fabulous!,"This is one of the best Backyardigans collections! Our kids LOVE Chichen-Itza Pizza: the songs, the story and particularly the adventure through the jungle.What's Bugging You has me saying the title in the style of Uniqua and Tyrone for hours after viewing.Who Goes There has superb music and lyrics!Fly Girl features a cheery Uniqua and a grumpy Tasha, Pablo and Tyrone plus catchy songs!"
5,Backyardigans is a great movie for my Grandaughter,My grand-daughter watches backyardigans constantly and this was a great great buy. Everything has been done professionally.Thank YOU
3,Backyardigan' Flying Again....,"I was very surprised to see my grandson go through this video without his usual ""glued to"" expression when he get's a new Backyardigan's adventure video. I am finding that the newer video's seem to be including more music than 'action' and along about the 3rd or 4th song, they are losing him. He is 3-1/2 years old and unless you grab him and hold him, you will not be able to capture his attention throughout the entire video. He will sit and watch a 2 hour movie, but when you stop and sing every 2-1/2 minutes....... he's done with you!!"
3,"Does the job, with a few quirks","I was given this apron as a gift, in general I like it. It's made of good material and all of the stitching has held, with the exception of one problem - the D-links that allow you to adjust the length around the neck are of poor quality. I'm constantly having to pinch them closed otherwise the straps slip out of them and the apron cones right off. Like I said I generally like this apron, but that one little thing drives me crazy."
2,"Flat, and Lifeless Art.","I picked this up from the library with high expectations. Yet, I was quite dissapointed. The art is a sort of westernized-manga, and though the plot is a good one, I felt that it was quite slow and boring in many parts. It's an entertaining read, but I wouldn't waste any money on it."
5,Three Supernal Overtures,"Although Walter's performance/rehearsal of Siegfried Idyll is excellent, I would say the primary feature of this recording is the outstanding performances of the Meistersinger, Flying Dutchman, and Parsifal overtures. I have never heard any other interpretations that measured up to Walter's. Gorgeously and powerfully played, with an unusually strong sense of the overall structure and meaning of the works. Whatever you have to pay for this album, it's worth it for these three works alone!"
1,Not Impressed!,My husband and I purchased this set of Davey and Goliath because we had previously bought Vol. 1 thru 6 for our children and we had all really enjoyed them. They were clean old fashioned fun! I ordered this second set (7thru 12) and expected it to be the same. We were so disappointed. In each show Davey is very disrespectful of his parents and authority. He lies much of the time and there are no consequences. We ended up getting rid of them because they were so bad and not a good influence on our children. It was a total waist of money!
4,Not perfect but I like it.,"I agree with a previous reviewer that you have to work the lids a bit to get them to stay together. They really don't just snap together right away. Also I agree the depth could be just a tad bit deeper. However, overall, I really like the convenience of being able to store as much as three different types of lunchmeat (or even a pack of hot dogs) all at the same time. This is a neat little storage device that can be really handy when you need it."
2,Only for Dedicated Hawking Fans,"Stephen Hawking's Black Holes and Baby Universes and other Essays is a compilation of approximately a dozen essays and presentations made by Hawking from 1976 to 1992. Though some of the essays deal with scientific issues (e.g. physics, cosmology, black holes) most of the book is autobiographical in nature discussing the author?s upbringing and struggle with ALCS.Written in the aftermath of the popular A Brief history of the Universe, the current work is a rather blatant effort to exploit Hawking's popularity with minimum effort. Although a short book (approx. 175 hardcover) there is much repetition amongst the essays. Readers with even a passing knowledge of Hawking will find no new information in this book.Overall, a disappointing book that has little to offer. Only for the most dedicated Hawking aficionado."
1,Stephen Hawking Phones It In,"Fans of A Brief History of Time will be terribly disappointed as they hack their way through this series of incredibly repetitive lectures presented as a series of essays. Though Hawking mentions in the intro that he's tried to reduce the redundancy, he obviously hasn't tried very hard -- you get the feeling you're reading the same lecture 13 times in a row. He also doesn't bother to dumb his stuff down as in Brief History. In this case, the lectures are academic, dry, tedious, and mildly absurd. He may be a genius, but you won't learn a thing working your way through this tome."
1,a bit boring for a physics student,"I have read quite a few books in the area of theoretical physics, astronomy and cosmology, and I found this book was less than I had expected. I actually wouldn't have read it if it hadn't been given to me by a friend. I would suggest something along the lines of Black Holes and Time Warps, Kip Thorne -- for easy reading theo phys..."
1,"Can anyone but Hawking find a ""Black Hole"" in 'Black Space""?","--How does one locate a ""Black Hole"" when looking at the ceaselessness of 'BLACK SPACE'?-Please provide an answer?-If there is an answer!-Thanks!--"
2,Knocked-up Ebony Mamas,"I bought this at Joe's Adult Books. Boy was it misrepresented. Just like the time I tried to read about special relativity, thinking that simultaneity on a railway carriage must be like something out of a Victorian sleaze-novel.Anyhoo, Wittgenstein said that the purpose of a popularization is to make people think they understand something they don't understand. What seems to be a common current of science popularizations is that they ""explain"" things in such a simplified way that the reader who actually wants to get down to brass tacks is completely mystified. Einstein's book on relativity is a case in point, as is this book in which the candid reader is informed that ""Objects at rest tend to remain at rest, therefore heavier objects will fall faster in a gravitational field."" Got that? If so, maybe you can explain it to me. Listen, I know something about Physics. Back in the seventies I built a particle accelerator out of a blow drier and a box of Mike and Ikes."
3,Sophomore jinx,"This book reminded me of Led Zeppelin's ""Coda"" album, a bunch of B-sides and outtakes. ""A Brief History of Time,"" was more like masterpiece ""Led Zeppelin II."" ""Black Holes"" sometimes was entertaining, but seemed like it was slapped together by the publisher to capitalize on the success of ""A Brief History of Time."" You also need more of a technical background to understand some of the lecture material. Still worth the paperback price."
3,"Good, but not up to Hawking's standard","I immensely enjoyed A Brief History of Time, and had high hopes for this book as well. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book full of interesting things, but there is far too much repitition, both with A Brief History of Time and withing this book itself. It seemed that he explained his ""the only boudary conditition is that there is no boundary"" theory in every essay. Good material, but you won't find much in here that you didn't already know if you read A Brief History of Time. I would recommend skipping this and going straight to The Universe in a Nutshell, a more recent Hawking book."
4,A step into Hawking's personal life,"This particular book by Hawking explores his personal life as well as the physicist side of life. I become interested in how a man like Hawking came to be after reading his ""A Brief History of Time."" This book answered all of my questions as he goes farther into depth about how he grew up, and lives with ALS. This book is a composite of many essays, so the reader will find that Hawking repeats himself more than twice. This is a good book, but not quite to the standard as his previous book was. I gave a rating of 4 stars because the title of this book was somewhat deceiving, as an aspiring physicist looking for an educational book might choose this one, little realizing that it focuses much on Hawking's life, instead."
5,Excellent,"An excellent read, though I was alarmed at the prospect of the Earth being crushed by a super-massive black hole in around 3 billion years time. Then again, I'm a glass-half-empty sort of a person."
3,14 easy pieces,"This is a compilation of 14 loosely knit essays. From 7. to 13., mainly conversational-style exposition of Hawking's musings on older and newer physics (general relativity, quantum mechanics, black holes, his introduction of imaginary time, baby universes, determinism, ""the final theory"" addiction); the rest is, more or less, of personal and autobiographical nature. Although a reader will not find anything mind-bending in this book (and some topics, like superstrings or quantum gravity are, if not obsolete, then at least greatly changed)- this is a relaxed glance on a few basic concepts of modern cosmology."
1,a bit boring for a physics student,"I have read quite a few books in the area of theoretical physics, astronomy and cosmology, and I found this book was less than I had expected. I actually wouldn't have read it if it hadn't been given to me by a friend. I would suggest something along the lines of Black Holes and Time Warps, Kip Thorne -- for easy reading theo phys/cosmol..."
4,Read Brief History of time first,I really love this book but the true is that is a little heavie so if you are planing to read this book you better have some time to think about it and if you can i recomend you to read firs brief history of time. In this book I got a better understanding of what i already knew about Hawkings job and about him thats why it was a very good complement.
4,Handy,"If you are traveling and need a travel wallet, this is the one for you. This wallet is perfect. You can put up to 3 passports in it. It has a section for your tickets, boarding pass, credit cards, money and change. Even when you are on vacation, you can use this wallet instead of dragging your purse with you. Buy this, it's perfect for traveling."
3,Too Small,"It looks nice and the leather feels very soft but its too small. Many people while traveling these days print off their flight information off the internet, as I usually do. I was looking for something that would hold folded pieces of paper with my itinerary on it. I thought this would be the right size but its too small. Really frustrating!!!"
2,Cheap - not worth buying,"The item looks much better in the picture, I was very disappointed upon receiving it. It looks and feels cheap...while this may be a good price, it's not worth what you get."
4,It smells like leather...mmmmm,"It fits everything and then some. The tan is more like a mustardy yellow, but still super cute. I'm happy with my purchase."
3,Cool Passport Wallet,"The size of this wallet is perfect. I needed something that would hold my passport, ticket and boarding pass all in one. The color is nice too (beige). The only downside is the zipper-you really have to pull hard to open n close."
3,Passport Wallet,"This is a good product. It is just a little bigger than I expected. If you don't mind the size, it will work great for you."
2,It's not THAT bad,"When I bought this disc back in 1992, it highly amused me for about fifteen minutes. The main reason was the King Missile (you know, of ""Jesus Was Way Cool"" and ""Detachable P***s"" fame) cover of ""Get Up."" What was a slightly annoying song in the original version on _Green_ became maniacally entertaining in the King Missile version, complete with deliberately stumbly and out of tune keyboard lines and enthusiastically off-pitch backing vocals, and sped up a good 20 BPM from the original version. I can happily live without the rest of the album (though the Sicilian version of ""Talk About the Passion""--not ""Pretty Persuasion"" as the other reviewer mentions--is kind of interesting)."
1,An agressively terrible REM tribute,"Most tribute albums are pretty bad; it's a fact of life. And you know what? Those bad tribute albums sound like ""Sgt. Pepper"" compared to this one. Bands you've never heard of and will never hear again, most of whom can't play a lick, do their own versions of REM songs that are often unrecognizable. About the only listenable cut is an Italian version of ""Pretty Persuasion."" I've owned over 1,000 albums over my lifetime; this is one of the 10 worst."

3,Going to more of an adult sound. LOSE THE CRAPPY DIALOGUE!,"This would have made for a wonderful CD that kids and Adults could enjoy together, but some of the songs are realy stupid.. A comes before B, and the terrible verson of The little Drummer Boy really drag down the CD.Alvin sounds like a bratty kid who seems to think that if Santa doesn't get to him first, then he will not come at all. The little Drummer Boy shows Alvin being way out of control dring some concert. If these songs were ment to be funny, I must not have caught the joke...Liked... Here Comes Christmas, Petite Papa Noel, The Chipmunk Song, I don't want to be Alone for Christmas, and Rudolph The Red Nosed Raindeer... Other then the 2 stinkers on the CD.. It could have been better without the 2 songs mentioned..."
4,well crafted,"Well constructed storyline with a myriad of characters. May be a little convoluted but still gripping. I like Linda Fairstein's style based, clearly, on her profound knowledge of her subject. My criticism is that like other of her stories her heroine, Alex, ends up being attacked by the guilty party. In real life I would think she would have resigned long ago."
