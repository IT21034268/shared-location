2,Fat Smash Diet,I couldn't stay on this diet. It made me weak and the initial detox faze was to long for me.
3,Fat Smash Diet,This was very easy to read and informative. It does not go into detail on all the foods you can have but it is informative and if you follow the diet you will see results. It is easier I am sure to do this if that is your primary focus all day every day
4,Great diet,The book was great. Especially the detox 9 day diet. I never felt more energetic. And I lost 6 pounds.I love the fact that there is a diet where fruits and veggies are in Phase 1. Usually all the other diets you can't eat those things. I never understood that.Great book.
4,Poking Fun at The King,"It was a light hearted approach to an old subject and very well done. Kim Basinger, Angie Dickinson, and Sherie (?) Richards still looked great back in 2004. A bit slapstick, but good comedy throughout. Clever ending. Good music and scenery."
5,A priest who really gave a damn about junkies,"With all of the political talk about the drug addict problem, here is one man who tried to make a difference. Meet Father Danial Egan, a priest who is driven to protect and help female junkies. Action stories are pretty cool, but can be pretty hollow compared to the harsh reality of what one lone priest did day in and day out, trying to make the lives of female addicts better. It is a story of hope and upward struggle. A good read when you want to put your world into perspective.Doug Setter, Bsc. author ofOne Less Victim: A Prevention GuideandStomach Flattening"
4,This book brought back all those childhood memories!,"Now I know what I was actually gazing at as a third grader watching all those Gemini space shots in the classroom. The Race brings a nostalgia to an era that defined the United States in the sixties. After reading this book, you will ask the same question that echos through NASA and the minds of millions of Americans: ""Why haven't we gone back?"" This book will also train you how to function on little or no sleep. I couldn't put it down at night!"
4,"Review of the 17"" Axeman Cometh by Fiskars","The axe is great. The blade is very sharp and cuts great. But the axe is too top heavey. If there was a soild handel on it, the axe would be excelent because with the hallow handle it slips out of your hand and tends to bounce. I would suggest that you wear gloves with good grip or a rubberised coated grip on the handle of the axe."
1,pretty flakey,"Tried this for awhile then gave it away. I could never seem to get the hang of it. It keeps giving indications where there is nothing there. Maybe its too sensitive, or maybe I'm just not using it properly; but it didn't help me much in my carpentry work."
1,Exercise in frustration!,"I have owned this tool for about a year and normally get so disgusted with it that I wind up putting it away and start drilling small holes in my wall to locate the first stud. Today ""I put it away"" permanently so I won't be frustrated anymore. I have even tried to use this thing on the stud after I have located it by drilling holes in the drywall. Maybe the Multiscanner Pro will see it - maybe it won't. But one thing is consistent: every time I go over the same area, the reading will be different, and wrong. It is piece of junk. Save your money."
1,Useless toy,"Today was the second time i was using this toy for serious job. It really was a guessing game. First me, then my brother tried to locate nails in a drywall. For some reason this finder finds them everywhere at the first time and doesn't find any at the second.Tried to find studs with it. Couldn't get it 8 out of 10 times.It also keep finding electrical wires where there is none.Money waste."
1,Not even worth a dime,"I own this for about 6 months, I try to use it on a daily basis. I've found it in accurate, always off. I usually end off doing the little holes trick."
1,A PIECE OF JUNK,"I bought it from Home Depot and it doesn't work. I exchage it because I'm thinking a defect unit. The replaced one didn't work either. If you want to try it, keep your receipt. DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME. I'm very disappointed at the ZIRCON products."
1,Zero stars,This product is completely worthless. The only thing it accurately detects is the forty bucks in your wallet that it's going to relieve you of. It is inaccurate on all settings especially the AC. The company shill who gave this thing five stars must have stock in a law firm that specializes in product liability.
1,Words fail...,I didn't think something this bad could actually exist. It is bad enough that the message of the book is sick and potentially harmful to any young person that might read it... but the actual delivery is sub-par on top of that.
1,Pure Evil,"This book is nothing more than evil, right-wing, hateful garbage! While I strongly oppose the banning of any book, I'd make an exception for this awful piece of propoganda. The author should be charged with committing a HATE CRIME!"
1,Disgusting,"Honestly, I can't think of anything good to say about this book. They're trying to teach children that homosexuality is caused by molestation, but therapy will make it all better. Seriously? Does the author know anything about the subject he is writing about?"
3,People are so stupid,The Book is good why is everyone saying its gay bashing have you read the book I guess most people are too stupid to read it. we might have to make a picture book for them.
1,<Alfie's Home> is Prejudiced Drivel,"I was truly offended by this book. Purporting to be a text thathelps children deal with the very real problem of child molestation,it is in reality a thinly veiled attack on homosexuality. It equates homosexuality with mental illness, paints homosexuals as molesters and moral degenerates, and suggests that homosexuals can be ""cured"" and go on to live happy little suburban lives. The author must live in a world 30 years in our social past. We've come further than this, and we should know better. The publisher, International Healing Foundation, suggests that parents should read this with their children. They are right, if only because the book serves as a horrible example of prejudice and wrong-thinking, a perfect example of what *not* to do. If I sound upset, it's because I'm really p.o.'d -- I first ran across this book after it had been donated to a local children's library."
1,Hello?? Research??????????,"It's absolutely amazing how many people write about stuff that they've never researched. This book is a patent attempt to curry favor with the so-called religious right. The characters are flat, with wooden dialogue. Anyone who reads this must do so with the knowledge that very rarely is a young person molested by a gay person (in fact, 90% of molestations come from heterosexuals) -- so, it's clear that this book is simply full of lies."
1,Not for children,When was the last time you thought it was appropriate for your child to read a book with adult themes? Or have that book read TO them by you? by their teacher? I didn't think so.Any kid still reading picture books should not have to think about rape and molestation. If you love your children you won't put them in such an uncomfortable and inappropriate situation.
2,"Some good comping ideas, but ...","much of this book is devoted to basic finger exercises, none of which are jazz-specific. My philosophy is that exercises should be musical, or at least close .... About 2/3 of this book is mindless permutations. I was disappointed."
5,Finian's Rainbow,Bought this as a gift for my sister who loves musicals. She wore the movie out. Took her to see it on Broadway recently. The cast from this movie/cd was much better. Great songs.
1,No Bonus Tracks - No Purchase!,"What the other reviewer failed to mention is that Collectors' Choice omitted the 3 bonus tracks which appeared on the Rhino Handmade edition of this soundtrack, thereby rendering it absolutely worthless to true soundtrack collectors and devoted Petula Clark fans. People who fall into both categories already have the vinyl edition of this soundtrack, which is the same as this CD. I, for one, would not even CONSIDER purchasing this sham of a release from Collectors' Choice. I, and I suspect many other soundtrack and Petula fans who were not able to get the Rhino Handmade edition, will hold out for finding a used one at a reasonable price. BOO and Shame On You Collectors' Choice!"
1,Kids Did Not Like It,I couldn't get a single one of my four kids to express much of an interest in this. They tried several times and just could not find much to get excited about.
2,Not so fun,"My sons are really quite excellent video game players, yet they found this game to be too difficult to enjoy. They are 7 and 9."
5,My new favorite measuring thing,"Next to my 18"" T-square, I use this the most of any measuring/marking tools I have. I used it to do the fussy measurements for a pair of folding tables - lots of centering and distance-from-end measurements - and everything came out just right. It's a great size for one-handed gripping while still covering most of the range you need on a regular basis."
5,Accurate and easy to use,"If you want to experience the precision of Incra without spending big bucks for an Incra Jig, give their rulers a try. The Incra T-rule has holes at 1/64th inch intervals and slots at 1/32nd intervals suitable for a utility knife. The long bar guides the rule along the edge for perfect marking or scoring cuts. I've used this to make scoring cuts cross-grain in oak plywood before rabbeting with a router and it eliminated tearout of the veneer. You can also slide the bar to either end so it can stand vertically (the end of the rule is calibrated too). The metal is a little thin but that eliminates any inaccuracy from the angle of the pencil. You'll want to use a 0.5 mm mechanical pencil with this - a regular wood pencil has too big a point."
4,Incra t-rule,This is a good product that will do a lot of things. I only wish that a .5mm pen came with it.
1,Not Very Useful,"I have owned this tool for years, over 5 years in fact. Although it seems like a good idea, I seldom use it. Almost never in fact. It is all but impossible to carry around, and it is also hard to store. If you put it into a drawer it may get dented, and if you just put it out on the bench it can be harmed as well. How does a person carry this thing around? Bottom line, you have to find a way to keep this close or it is useless.When measuring anything this tool is OK, but not great. It really measures no better than other measuring tools. If you do not have a special pencil with a .05 lead it is hard to mark through the little notches in the tool.What is excellent about the tool is the fractional markings. You do not have to count little lines, the measurements are marked with the exact number (Like 15/16th). Other than that the thing has little value.AD2"
4,A Solid Release,"I was listening to Xtreme Metal Radio on live365.com and I heard Godspeed and American Dreams. I must admit at first listen I was not sure I was listening to Pro-Pain or not. So I decided to pick up this album. I do agree with one of the other reviewers about those two songs. They do have that ""Nu"" metal type feel to them. Nevertheless it is a solid release from an often over looked metal band."
5,Maybe the best Pro-Pain CD Yet,"Plain and simply this CD is heavy as hell and crushing with good hooks and melodies. The songs retain that Pro-Pain hardcore/punk edge but there are couple of new twists I haven't heard on previous releases. In many of the choruses they incorporate the modern day approach of using clean vocals and harmonies to offset the dirty/gruff vocals used in the rest of the song. They also do an instrumental track that is very cool and a nice change of pace. I would agree that the songs may not be as up-tempo across the board as prior releases but the songs are extremely heavy, thrashy, and have that Pro-Pain sound. IMHO, I hear a band that has really matured in their song writing and may have released their best project to date. Go get it, you won't be disappointed. Just make sure you are not listening and driving your car at the same time as this music may cause you to careen into another vehicle as you snap your head back and forth like a banshee!!!"
4,come on,COD can do better than that. This is the funnest game i have ever played but the game is way to short. If they could add 9 or 10 more leverls to this game it would be really fun. I have heard about the 360 version and how its long and all that but guess what i dont have a 360. I have heard that it is a totally different story also. Anyways back to the regular game. it has great grafics. top knoch missions. I advise anyone to get this game and the rest of the COD games. it doesnt have limbs flying off or any of that stuff. You learn a lot about WW2 and what happened but still buy or rent the game at your local gaming store ASAP or you will be one sad camper. Once again BUY IT
5,Truly Great Game,"Probably one of the most fun and addcting games i have ever playedIts great that the characters have personalitys and you actually get to expirience some of WW2. The extras are pretty cool too.Please go step away from your computer, go to best buy and buy this game immediately"
3,"Lots of Fun, but Too Short","I really enjoyed Call of Duty 2, but when I finished my final mission, I couldn't believe that was all there was. I really can't see myself going back in to play this over and over, as the missions are pretty linear and you don't have too many choices. The layouts guide you where to go for the most part and other than replaying it at a harder difficulty level, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of replay value, at least from my perspective. Great graphics and a lot of fun, but I wanted more and it seems like the game might be just a bit overpriced for what you get."
1,What is up with the other reviews this is CRAP!!!!,"Call of duty 2 was the best shooting game I have ever played. But Big red One is a piece of crap I hate this game the crosshair aims for you making it hard to find this game realistic. And the graphics suck, And on top of all that it has the worst gameplay ever. If you want to buy a good game with awsome gameplay buy Call of Duty 2 not big red one."
3,Ok... BUT,"Not a lot to say here, BUT, I might as well voice my immediate reaction to the opening trailer of the game. As a Canadian, I was incredibly shocked, in disbelief, and incensed that we were given no mention - given our contribution to the war effort in WWII. That set me off on the wrong foot with this game. It was hard for me to enjoy it really. Plus, I found it a bit slow and tedious. If you're more into HALO and PC Counter-strike ... don't know if you'll like this so much.OH blast, I just realized, this is Call of Duty 2. Hopefully they ammended such ommission in BRO."
3,Less of the same,I had high hopes for this game but it fell short of my expectations. My biggest complaint is its brevity. I finished this game in about 6-7 hours total on the normal difficulty level. That is just not enough game time for the cost of this game. The graphics and sound are great but the play is almost identical to the other COD titles. The AI is mediocre. I am a big fan of all WWII shooters but this title falls short. I will give credit to the voice overs. This feature did add a bit more of a human element to the game. I recommend renting this game before buying.
5,i recomend it to all my friends,"this is absolutely the best learning tool i have ever seen or used. it answers all the ""whys"" you would ask. i have recommended it to friends & am a better player today because of this product!"
4,Fretboard Logic Book One,"A novice on the guitar, I struggled with the concepts of understanding the organization of chords. I take lessons but the concepts using a numbering system were not sinking in. The first 10 pages of fretboard Logic were worth the price of the series. Bill Edward's style fits my learning needs and I can easily relate. I haven't gone beyond page 15,yet, because I want to apply what I think I now know. The DVD was helpful in further clarifying at a slow tempo what was spelled out in the book. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because I have so much more to do and I want to reserve final judgment until later."
5,"Finally, it all makes sense!!","Fretboard Logic is the magic key unlocking mastery of the guitar neck; as a hobbyist playing open chords in first position all my life, I now understand and can play in any key"
4,"I like it, but....","In the description of the book, it said it was the ""Hard cover"". Well, it wasn't. I still love the book, I was just under the assumption that it was the hard covered one."
3,"Meh, it is alright.","If you are looking for a book that gives a lot of facts, this is not the book for you. Get Steve Ryfle's ""Japans Favorite Mon-star"", hell, even get ""The Godzilla Compendium"". Those two books have way more information. But, ""Godzilla On My Mind"" does have some facts not mentioned in other books. The book itself looks more in depth on Godzilla and Japan at the time. Altogether it is a more personal piece than a haven for facts. As I said, not a book if you are looking for information and reference, but good if you want to learn more about Godzilla's affect on pop culture."
1,A real downer...,"This book ridicules G-fans, stating that the movies were intended as ""campfests"". Not true. Most of the movies had serious social and political commentary. Ishiro Honda intended all the G-films to have a message. He overuses the word ""cheese"" Not ALL G-films are cheesy, OK? Shut up, you lame excuse for a G-fan! Don't even borrow this book. I'ts a downer for G-fans."
1,Waste of money,"If you want to read the first-person opinion of a die-hard godzilla fan, long lists some stats and pop-culture refs to Godzilla that he found on the web one day (!) and a lot of rhetoric about how Godzilla is serious film (""so don't make fun of the author! Please! I'm NOT a geek!"") get this book.Want to read some real FACTS about the films and how they were made (other than the retread facts this author just regergitates), you won't find them here."
5,Very Well Written Look at Godzilla,And I'm not just saying that because I'm mentioned in it!J. Roberto - Kaiju-Fan Magazine
2,A little redundant and critical,"Yes, it doesn't look like the author really had enough info for a book even as long as this. He does repeat himself a lot. The part that bothered me most, though, was his overly critical analysis of the '98 Godzilla film by Tri-Star. Look the new film did have good effects and I didn't think they killed Godzilla as easily in New York (again in the film) as this author claims. And what was wrong with making Godzilla pregnant in the film? That was to imply the menace of the creature could ontinually be reeborn even if they destroyed the creature. Another thing. The author somewhat sympathises too much with Japan for being nuked in 1945. Look fella! Invasion of Manchuria by Japan 1931. Rape of Nanking by Japan in 1937.Pearl Harbor bombed by Japan 1941. Hong Kong invaded by Japan 1940's.And more big aggresive acts by Japan. The Japanese were not such victims in Hiroshima as they and you claim."
4,Nice overall functionality,"Out of the box, this thing is cheap and flimsey, it is from china. However, as long as you are able to mount it to the wall securely, it is solid. It looks great and functions great. I recomend using metal wall anchers from home depot. Not the cheap plastic ones they give you. Overall, I would buy again."
2,MDF,"It is visually appealing, but it took quite a while to install, and I don't know how well it will hold up if we move it because it is made out of MDF. Save some money"
2,Quality Issues,"I ordered two of these, and both sets had problems. They arrived with scrathes and cloudy/smudgy areas in the finish. I liked the way they looked and were exactly what I was looking for, there just seems to be a quality control problem and they will be going back."
1,Poor Quality Bungee Cord,"I bought these ball bungee's to replace some worn out ones that I use for a tent/canopy.The bungee cord in the picture looks much thicker than what was sent.I wanted 1/4"" cord and this is 1/8"" cord.The bungee cord is also not very elastic. The six inch ball bungees only stretch an inch.I paid $2 plus $6.50 S&H; for a total of $8.50. They won't last more than one or two set ups. In comparison, the old ball bungees made it through 30+ set ups.Don't waste your money on these."
4,Why did I wait till now???,Just finished building a log frame of a two story octagon house. Now try to imagine being 15' up a ladder leaning against a upright pealed log trying to chain saw all eight timbers exactly level hight of each other. Well the Levelite laser lines gave me the exact marks to follow from the center of the room and although I could have done it other ways it would have taken me hours instead of minutes and would not have been near as perfect. I was gloating about my work once I put up the bond beams (horizontal beams 12' long connecting the eight virticals) that allowed me to see the level as anyone could get log tops. Levelite was easy to use and I could think of 100 other uses for the pefectionist that I allways wanted to be. I give it only four stars because it needs a good remote control to go along with it for the solo user. Otherwise every builder needs one.
5,Much more than an umbrella stroller!,"I did tons of research on strollers and decided on the Triumph once my son outgrew his infant carrier. We LOVE this stroller! Since we went straight from the Snap & Go stroller base and infant carrier to the Triumph, it took a couple of months for my son to grow into it although we still used it fine. I love having a basket on an umbrella stroller even if it is small a a bit hard to get to. The only thing to watch out for is that the canopy can get dirty when it is folded up because the wheels touch it. I actually usually have the canopy off now but I think locking the wheels before folding it can help."
5,Another great production by Karen,"This review is based on having done the workout once--just now. If you like Karen's 20 minute Yoga Stretch segment from her Yoga Focus workout, then you will really like this one. Almost all of the stretches are done seated on the floor, on the knees, or lying down. There are only a few standing stretches done at the end. She uses the block a few times and the strap for a hamstring stretch and tricep stretch. The music is similar to her Yoga Focus stretch--mostly Spanish guitar. As usual, her cueing is so good I could follow her easily without having previewed the workout. Scenery is a green meadow backed by mountains. Very pleasant and relaxing and a bit more challenging than the 20 minute Yoga Focus stretch workout. I definitely enjoyed it and will likely do it often, but I love almost everything she's ever done."
5,So far so good,"I completed the stretch video last night and could certainly feel a difference. I consider myself a runner, but have slowed down over the years. Now when I work out, stretching usually consists of leg focused stretches. After completing the DVD I felt a major difference in doing leg only stretches, and full body stretching like Karen does in the video. I loved the feeling afterwards.My legs are really tight these days, and causing minor injuries, so my goal is to stick to the dvd consistently and loosen them up to their old limber state."
4,Gentle Stretch,For those who want a gentle stretch with no rush and peaceful music this is the dvd for you. After a long day of sitting at a desk job this is just enough to loosen the muscles for a peaceful night of sleep. Not for the advanced because they probably would be bored but beginners to in between would enjoy this full body stretch session.
5,GREAT stretch. Another wonderful DVD by Karen!,"Karen Voight's Full Body Stretch is GREAT as are most of Karen's DVDs. It helps one stretch hard to reach body parts in a gentle, relaxing easy manner while obtaining a good workout. Full Body Stretch can be used as a good warm up / cool down before or after an intense aerobic workout. New moves are used as well as some old, every day, even forgotten moves. This is a GREAT DVD for beginners through experts. It can be used by all.One night I even fell into a meditative state of ""sleep"" while in an unusual strech position until my Golden Retriever licked my face to ""wake"" me. He was strecthing in his own way, along with me:)Thanks for creating this new video, Karen!"
2,Full Body Streatch Review,Too advanced and difficult stretches. It was like advanced yoga. I was looking for something more basic and geared to folks over 50.
5,One of the best,I've been using HP5+ for about a year now and love it. The film's latitude and characteristics make it great for most shooting. I've managed to use this film in just about every lighting condition imagineable and have yet to be disappointed.
5,Stunning!,"I was cluless as to what I was getting into with the purchase of this CD but I have to say that this is a truly amazing CD. I had been searching for music similar to that of the ""Restoration"" soundtrack and I had found that the Purcell CD's I had purchased, although wonderful, were in different arrangements and not quite the same.I found this CD by happenstance and read a little mit about Jean-Baptiste Lully and decided since I love anything to do with Louis XIV I would take a chance and purchase it.I adore this CD, I have nothing bad to say about it. It is the epitome of baroque next to Teleman although, lighter..airy.If you close your eyes, you are transported to the court of the Sun King!Worth every single penny!Vive La Lully!"
4,This Book Is Da Bomb,"This book was a very good book, i think the book could be a little bit longer, but it was a good book.The well has some bad language so i would not recomend this book for youngsters. It isbetter for older kids."
4,Historical and Suspenseful,"I recommend this book because it shows lots of diversity between blacks and whites. Imagine yourself in a time around the late 1800's when slavery ended. This story takes place on a wide spread farm area. In this time and place there lived a Black family named the Logans that were surrounded by mostly white famlies. And if thats not bad enough this one family named the Simms hates them. Maybe the Simms are just jealous because the Logans are the only family with a well that's not dried up. They also have the most land and cattle in the area. But all isn't good and well. Once there is a fight between Hammer Logan and Charlie Simms. There is a big controversy, because if a black man was to hit a white man, the Black man might be hung from a tree. Hammer didn't only hit Charlie Simms, he left him motionless as if he were dead. Maybe he is... . So next time you're looking for a great book that is historical as well as suspenseful pick up The Well by Mildred D.Taylor."
4,great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this book is really great it talks about the struggles that some people had because of racists. Once i picked up this book i couldn't put it down. but this book is to short!
5,The Well David's Story,"This is a very good book that I would recommend to others. I think this book would be a great book to bring into your Social Studies Unit. It gives a very realistic view of what racism was like during the 1900s. You will experience many emotions when reading this book which are not limited to anger and sadness. Many parts of this book will surprise you. I was surprised when the Logan boys had to go down into the well and get the dead animals out. Children during this era had it much tougher than children of today. This story shows great courage, strength and generosity in the Logan family. This story will come to life for you."
3,Respect,This story is about two little boys and a fathers troubled past. When Charlie simms tests the Logan family's generosity so the logan families son Hammer will fight him. The Simms families son Charlie Simms does not like the Logans because they are a different color. I liked this book because it teaches you to respect others. It also teaches you to respect other races. I think this book had a comparison to '' Bud not Buddy'' and '' Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry'' because some of the people in those stories are racial and cant learn to be respectful.
4,The Well,"THE WELLThe Well is a very good book it about the Logan&#65533;s family in Mississippi and the wells are all dried up and theirs is the only one that is not dry so every one comes to them for water and the neighbors are really mean so they start world war 3 (but not really)This book was very good the best author I have read. Some of his books are good also like Roll of Thunder, her Cry. It is very good book also. But back to The Well it&#65533;s was very exciting I promise you want fall a sleep. So read the book the book."
5,Well worth the reading!,"This book is great! I would love to teach this book during my internship this fall. I have always been fascinated with history. Mildred Taylor has such a smooth way in which she writes her books. Not only are they sad and depressing, but they are motivating and enlightening. Her many books illustrate how evil and selfish our country was and in some ways still is today. I really appreciate the positive, strong image that is portrayed with the Logan family. Nothing makes me happier."
1,Does not meet expectations,we returned the product - did not meet expectations . It does not work well on gas stovesMaybe it will work on coal fire - as developed in olden days
1,Buy another brand!,"I bought a Emile Henry Tajine that broke in the 4th time I used it.The seller sent me another one, that also broke after a while.... I was always using the tajine to low fire and treated as proposed by the manufacturer.So I suggest: do not spend $140 for such a fragile tajine!"
3,Beautiful-Sturdy and Boy Can It Cook a Chicken!,"I bought this for my Wife a while ago and all I can say is we're well pleased with the results, tender, spicey chicken, onions and beef. Wonderful item that we may buy a second one just to have as back up."
4,Great!,"We bought the Tagine more than a month ago and use it regulary. We make in it everything from meat, potatoes and Rice. It cooks the food fast and it is easy to clean and looks great on the shelf"
1,Disappointed in its fragility,"We have two of these tajines. Today while cooking in one, we removed the lid and gently stirred with a wooden spoon and a large chunk of the ceramic base broke, spilling the contents all over a live burner. The tajine had been properly seasoned as directed, and was being used as we've done before countless times. Obviously this is some kind of hidden defect ... But because we've used it, we're out the full purchase price. Based on this experience, we would never buy an Emile Henry product again. They're simply not durable, especially considering the price! Buyer beware.Update: after complaining to Emile Henry customer service who brusquely referred us back to amazon, I'm happy to report that amazon is replacing it for us. Still not happy with Emile Henry, but thank you goes out to amazon customer service!"
5,Easy to use tagine,"We've created some amazingly tasty Moroccan dinners using the tagine on the stove top. And best of all, when you're done the tagine simply goes into the dishwasher."
5,Emile Henry Tagine,"Emile Henry Flame Top 2.6-Quart Tagine RedAfter 48 years of cooking I wanted/NEEDED a change. I was watching a travel program. The host was in Morocco sampling Tagine cusine and telling about the ingredients. I IMMEDIATELY started to research recipes and the cooking pot, both are called: ""TAGINE"". I came across 60 reviews on this Emile Henry at Amazon. I read the one con- and 30 of the pros! THEN IMMEDIATELY ordered this one from Amazon. It arrived on time, I used it the first day -- to season the tagine, just simmer a quart of milk. It takes about 20 mins. That heats the clay tagine. Let it cool then wash and GET COOKIN! The reviews made my decision on this tagine. For easy authentic, NO-FAIL print off recipes from Morocco: CHRISTINE BENLAFQUIH at ABOUT.COM."
5,Tagine,"Shipment arrived safe and on time......Cooking with this thing is a breeze, use it every week and have reached a point of dependency.......should have bought it sooner!"
5,Perfect,"Tagine was just what I had wanted. It arrived in record time. Scheduled for delivery in 5 days, but it arrived in 2. First meal lamb tagine."
4,Zen in a DVD case,"Survive Style 5+ has the feel the feel of a underground zine (perhaps from more of an 80s/90s zine scene, with its tendency towards novel bright fluorescent paper [mimicked by the bright pop style of movie,]) constantly playing with the absurd and still, through its semi-cohesive, semi-chaotic and yet allegorical plotline, it's able to be so much more.This is not a 'pop' work, this is a philosophical work. Or, maybe, it's really one in the same. Fans of this movie may be attracted to the sight of arms shooting off of beautiful women like rockets, over-dramatic Japanese prattle, and the bright flashy sets (not to mention the ever wonderful presence of Vinnie Jones,) but hopefully they're leaving with a slightly heightened sense of what entertained them. This film truly crosses from the absurd to become absurdist, with all the heightened feelings that conveys.Plus, Todanobu Asano is really, really just astoundingly hot in this movie."
2,It's okay I guess,"This item has nice extra's included in the package--the little book, etc. However, the software itself is more for an adult than a child and not that user friendly really. But for the price, I guess it was alright. There are no sounds with it--and kids like sounds."
3,Tales from the Bohemian Fringe,"L.A.'s quirky The Negro Problem have always been a listenable yet arch proposition. Leader Stew - a bear-like black bohemian - favors psychedelic fancy, both lyrical and musical. In the past, this has occasioned pleasant, mostly leaden work. It's unfortunate as Stew has shown, on two solo releases, an incisive and spirited talent. Can it be that leading a band is more burden than release for him? On the recorded evidence, yes. Yet on Welcome Black Stew calms down some. The Negro Problem begin to right past wrongs. The first half of the CD - especially ""Lime Green Sweater"" and ""Watering Hole"" - utilize Stew's narrative eye to tell recognizably human (and still surreal) tales from the bohemian fringe. By the time the tracks devolve to limitless whimsy, you just might stick around for the ride."
5,Clever and memorable music,"I picked up this CD at a second hand store because the cover looked interesting and the band had a great name. Imagine my pleasant surprise when I listened and discovered an album filled with clever lyrics, great hooks and melodies, and beautiful harmonies to complete the beautifully eclectic puzzle. Picking a favorite song is like picking a favorite flavor of ice cream, but the song I'm listening to the most right now is Lime Green Sweater (the background harmonies put the song over the top). Having watched a lot of Family Affair as a kid, Sebastian Cabot struck me as well and The Watering Hole is beautiful and melancoly without being sappy or sentimental. All praises due to Stew."
2,The Amazon Title Says this is a Chopping Axe!,"Please be informed that this is not a Chopping Axe as Amazon has listed, but instead it is a splitting axe. I already have a splitting axe and did not want to purchase a second one!"
2,ripper,definately a front runner in his (their) special x series as moving as head-hunter & as riveting as ghoul..(their):meaning both Jay & his daughter Rebecca Clarke ; since she started contributing since Hang-man. Can't wait for the next instalmentof the adventures to continue..right hear in my back yard...his muse Vancouver & Fraser valley region t.t.f.n
2,Uuhhhhmmm.....,"I'm not a fan of this game. Matches are long and boring. Also, barely any of the people listed by the other two reviewers are really in the game......There is no Giant Gonzales, there is no Repo Man, there is no Kamala....etc.... It includes, off the top of my head, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Hulk Hogan, Undertaker, Yokozuna, Narcissist Lex Luger, Razor Ramon, Mr. Perfect, Bam Bam Bigelow, and maybe a few others. I don't suggest getting this game."
1,Mistaken Identity,"This book was a psychobabble point of view at ""kinky"" people.It's a ""how to"" on dealing with a loved one who has kinks as if they were odd balls or sick or something...I returned this book."
3,"not for me, but maybe someone else","not exactly what i want in a pair of pants, but i guess someone else would like them since i returned them just in time to be bought again."
1,Slanderous,"If you are looking for an objective account of Paul Newman's life and work stay far away from this book. Quirk takes every chance to discredit Newman's acting ability and personality. At the begining of each paragraph, you begin to anticipate another stab at Newman and without fail it would come in one form or another. Quirk over and over again reveals his disdain for the actor when he should of been more concerned with the facts and the story."
4,Good Buy,"This item could be a little more sturdy - I would not put anything heavy on the top. But it is VERY attractive in my living room. The floor pan was cracked on the corner and part had been chipped away, but it was only about an inch in one corner so I can live with it since I use bedding inside. It was easy to assemble and I am pleased, It was worth the price though it should be discounted since the floor pan was broken. Overall it is a good buy and my two poodles love it."
4,I like it.,"It's probably best to plan on having another person around when you assemble it. I needed a pair of pliers to bend a couple of the hooks on the top open a tiny bit to get the top on. One of the strands of plastic was broken, and in the most obvious place possible, and I don't think there's a glue that can stick to this plastic... STILL it's a great price for a crate that looks way better than others unless you look at it up kind of close, it's hard to tell that the wicker is plastic.I'd buy it again. I love that I got it without paying shipping, too. Not for puppies or dogs that chew a lot.I didn't smell any plastic odor at all."
4,Nice,"The kennel arrived right on time, the price was good, not too hard to assemble...only problem was some of the rattan wrapping was falling apart. I was able to fix it at home, and Amazon took some money off. It doesn't look great - but, it will do, and my dog doesn't care ; )"
1,I'm returning it,"#1, my daughter and I could not put this together unless we bent the metal bars, which I didn't want to do.#2, I knew it wasn't really wicker, but the ""wicker"" is plastic and it has an awful smell. I'm afraid my puppy would be poisoned."
4,mostly happy,The product is great and set up easily. The only problem I had was that it was damaged when delivered. The potty try had a crack in it. It looks nice with the furniture in our room and the dogs have plenty of room(we got two of them!)
5,Cool Kennel,I received my kennel within the specified time frame and have been extremely happy with it. My dog is happy as well. Visitors to our home have commented on how well the kennel goes with our decor too. An excellent purchase all the way around!
4,the aprthied minded gentleman,"With Aparthied gone and the South African state in crises it seems probably an imporbable time to read about one of the architects of the SOuth African Republic in the cold war period. Mr. Vorster stand atop the White South african leadership heep in the same way that Botha, De'Klerk, or Verword, or should I say also Smuts and Malan do. In a sense he is a member of the political elite of the post 1945 South Africa and a recommended read if you find this time period interesting."
5,Some of Debussy's best music,"For years, due to copywrite issues, ""The Children's Corner"" suite was only available in a French edition. Now it's here, in an affordale Dover edition, along with some rarer piano solos.""Children's Corner"" ranges from playable (""Dr. Gradus ad Parnassum"" and ""The Little Shepherd"" and ""Doll's Lullaby"" to the evilly tricky ""Snow is Dancing"" made famous by Tomita in an electronic version. The suite was written for Debussy's daughter and is utterly charming and really fun to play. The etude's from Book II are incomplete here, but have some of the nices works, along with a beautiful berceuse.If you play piano and love the Impressionist composers, this is a must-have."
5,Great Value,"Dover consitently puts out the best scores for the pricepoint. This is a fantastic collection of works. The score quality is very high (sewn lay flat binding), large print, large pages with good margins for performance notes, etc."
5,perfect fit,"This was easier to install than the Toyota OEM surprisingly! Works great! No problems at all, will plan on buying more in the future."
3,ok but can be better,"I bought it for front driver side and back driver side windowsIt doesn't fit exactly, you have to drill a hole on it to make it fit into the original slot.However, it work and it's cheaper."
5,Watch What Ya Buy,Kind of a strange thing that Adorama doesn't list that the HB-38 is standard equipment and is included in the box when you buy the 105mm Micro lens. I now have an extra one that's not worth the shipping cost to return return it for credit. Thank you Adorama!
3,So-so service,"I received the book promptly, so that was not the problem. Iwas disappointed that I paid for a ""new"" book, and what I receivedwas not new. The book did not have wrapping on it, and appearedto have been on a shelf for a while. That would be ok if I had notrequested and paid for a new copy. There is writing on the insidecover ""10."" This indicates the age of this ""new"" book. At one time,someone paid only ten dollars for a hard-covered book. Notwhat I had hoped for."
3,Worth the read if you're an O'Connor fan,"A selection of correspondence sent by Flannery throughout her life, the reading is, at times, dry. Most of the time, however, her humor and passion shines through. As one approaches the end of the book and, concurrently, the end of her life, you can't help but feel saddened by her words and continual optimism. Well worth the read if you are an O'Connor fan; may not matter much to you if you aren't."
4,Bought for class,"I bought this to aid in a presentation for class. It doesn't have a particular letter that I was looking for. However, what I've read to date is rather interesting. It starts off with a letter Flannery wrote to a woman requesting she be Flannery's agent. I imagine it was much easier obtaining an agent/manager during that time than it is now. Not that I've tried.Anyway, I'm looking forward to finishing the letters and getting an insight to Flannery O'Connor's life as a writer."
4,The Lost Patrol,"Stereotypical characters & hammy performances, but so what? The tension builds & builds as the patrol (lost in Iraq) is picked off 1 by 1 by an unseen enemy. 1 of John Ford's own favorites, & it's such a treat to see (British) Victor McLaglen *not* play an Irishman. Relentless in showing the soldiers being killed by their own stupidity. Grim stuff. 7/10"
3,Mediocre,"The Lost Patrol transports us to Mesopotamia in 1917 where a British patrol marching through the desert suffers the loss of its commanding officer to Arab fighters. It's up to the sergeant (who sounds very American) to safely guide the troops to safety. Things become rather complicated when they reach an oasis which turns out to be more of a deathtrap than salvation...In short, the acting is really nothing special, the plot is quite interesting, while the dialogues are average and often below average. Boris Karloff's religious fanatic character was just annoying as was the sergeant's cluelessness vis-à-vis military command. As for the corporal, he seemed to be in his 90s.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might, just might, provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it; No masterpiece here."
3,"Somewhat disappointed, it's OK but wouldn't buy again","I bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday. She also got the wooden Melissa & Doug Folding Horse Stable which is wooden and PERFECT. I wish we had left it at that. This item is so flimsy, it falls apart on a daily basis. I know my daughter is young, but even I was turning the pulley and the green wall fell off! I get annoyed every time I walk past it and all the beams have fallen off and it's half wrecked. It makes it hard to play with and certainly to move around. I've debated crazy gluing it together but haven't tried that yet. Compared to the stable, this is of a much lower quality. We haven't done the water part yet but I plan to do that outside and it will probably fall apart before we get it out there! Oh well, she seems to like it alright, but definitely prefers her barn."
3,Please make them more durable!,"My daughter has many Breyer products and enjoys playing with them. She loves playing with the wash stall because the sprayer really works well. However, Breyer needs to look in to the durability of their products. The stall (like most Breyer stalls)falls apart very easily. When it is moved it has to be put back together even if she's taking it from her closet to her floor to play with. It's quite frustrating."
5,They are even great Live!,"I saw them Live with the Van's Warped Tour in Hershey and they were actually one of the best bands there! They were alot of fun and high energy. I got the cd at the concert because of their performance and actually listen to it all the time. It is really different to hear a punk band with not only one keyboarder, but two."
2,Not what I expected...,The case is very tight around the camera. I would recomend going with another case than this for the Z7590. Also the pockets that were meant to hold batteries and memory are tight as well.
3,Not the best choice,"I got this carrying case three days ago for my new Kodak z740. The camera fits perfectly well inside and is well protected. I has compartments for extra memory and batteries and it isn't that heavy so it's comfortable. Even the material inside is convenient because it doesn't scratch your LCD. That being said, I don't think I made the best choice. The case is ugly(though not as ugly as I thought it would be, from the reviews i'd read). But, I honestly think that how stylish the case is doesn't really matter as long as the camera is well protected. However the metal magnetic snap sucks. The little screw that holds it together started sliding of the first day I had it. I have to keep fixing it. And, since I've only had the thing three days, I'm pretty sure it'll end up falling off eventually."
5,Kodak Carrying Case - dg 2/08,I love the carrying case. It really protects my camera. I don't have to worry about damaging the camera by putting it in my purse. The small compartments inside for both the memory card and extra batteries makes life easier for any photographer. I plan on buying another one for my boyfriend who has the same camera that I have.
4,Works fine for me,"After getting all the ""inners"" out of it, my camera fits fine. I have the Kodak Z740. I also don't carry extra batteries or cards, so my snug fit is just fine. My only wish is for the case to have a snap for the belt loop making it easier to attach the case. As it is, I have to undo my belt, etc.Overall, I'm very pleased with it."
4,This Case Works Just Fine!,"I just received this camera case for my new Kodak Z710 Camera. If you read some of the reviews, some people said this case doesn't fit this style camera or it's too tight. You have to pull out the thick lining first. If you don't, your camera won't fit inside. I just pulled it out and my camera fits great inside. I love the magnetic closure too! This is a very nice case, worth the money. I still have room inside if I wanted to store an extra battery pack. I didn't want to buy just a generic case for my new camera, I wanted a Kodak case to match it. Great!"
2,gotta be Something better,The magnetic clasp is weak very weak - making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it's own. I keep this camera case INSIDE of my purse.i wouldn't recommend this productthere has to be something better
3,Kodak Camera Case,"Although the camera case is the size advertised it seems just a little small when you put in the camera, extra battery and extra menory card."
1,case too small,This is a nice camera case but is way too small for the Kodak DX7590. I would not recommend this case for that camera.
1,Does not fit Z7590 Easyshare Model,"I recently purchased a Kodak Easyshare Z7590, and have been extremely happy with the camera. However, I received this case as a Christmas gift, and was upset to find out that it DOES NOT FIT the Z7590. In fact, though Amazon advertises that this is the case for the Z7590, it doesn't say anywhere on the Kodak packaging that it will fit that camera model. If you want a case for the Z7590, I strongly encourage you not to get this case.This case may be perfect for the other models listed (it is very nice looking, and appears to offer adequate camera protection), but it WILL NOT accomodate the Z7590. I have since purchased a much larger case that easily holds the camera, strap, memory cards, and even the charger (a CaseLogic brand case)."
3,Too small for Kodak Z7590,"Very nice camera case, but a tight sqeeze for the Kodak Z7590. You have to work to get the camera and neck strap in or out of the case, so the next size bigger might be a better choice for this camera."
4,"Finally, a case that fits (almost)!","I spent a fair amount of time attempting to find a generic camera case that fits my Kodak DX 6490 camera. None came very close. This case is a bit on the small side, but does work. There is additional storage for a flash memory card and that's about all that will fit once you get the camera and its shoulder strap stuffed inside. However, that's all I need to fit, so it works for me."
3,Case,Was not quite right for the camera I wanted it for. Have used for other one since and pleased with it.
3,Confusion,"This book offers the oppurtunity to expand on what Danny Casolaro discovered during his investigation of the BBCI banking scandal, unfortunately the book gets lost in all the characters and their starnge behavior. The book fails to zero in or focus on the true implications of what Danny discovered about who and what is running this country. The same people who assassinated President Kennedy are the same people running this country today. The book points out all the characters, but fails to connect all the dots. The book does offer good background and information about the unsavory side of our government and to what lengths it will go to cover up what it doesn't want us to know."
3,"Well Researched, but missing something","I was interested in this topic and read the two reviews below. I decided to pick this book up, I was amazed by the depth and breadth of the research that went into this book. The only complaint I have is that I would be reading the book and forget what I had just read. The prose is occasionally awkward and caused me to have to go back and re-read the previous paragraph or page just to see what or who the authors were discussing.All in all I'm glad I read it."
4,Questions. Questions. Questions,"I read this book about a week ago and I have to say that although it was quite informative, it left many holes. Unfortunately, we may never know exactly what happened to Danny Casolaro because powers that be will prevent it from becoming public knowledge. The book was mostly a gripping tale about his life as he tried to expose connections between the CIA, drug trafficking, hollywood, and weapons procurement in a tax free Indian reservation. The book lost me when they added a chapter about Lady Diana which had absolutely no connection to his death other than the CIA knowing about it. Still if you want some forbidden knowledge, I'd recommend the book anyway. It is a fairly quick and easy read."
5,"Good, but not as good as The Last Circle","The second best book on the Octopus that I've seen - while it doesn't compare to The Last Circle, it will give you a great overview of the Octopus and how it connects to different conspiracies.It doesn't go into nearly as much detail as The Last Circle (which I highly recommend) this is a good choice for anyone looking for a very brief overview of the Octopus conspiracy."
2,A learning process,"WWF Steel Cage Challenge was the second wrestling game for the NES. It was a learning process, the graphics are poor, the sounds are poor, the colors are poor, the gameplay is poor. The only thing keeping this game alive at the time was the first grapple feature where you perform power moves after fighting your opponent for leverage in a grapple. There was also a nice selection of 12 wrestlers, Bret Hart, Hogan, Undertaker, Sid, IRS, Ted Dibiase, and a few others, the downfall is that the wrestlers were rather small with a gigantic ring. Finally the nicest part of the game was the Road to Wrestlemania which featured a season of wrestling and even cage matches! The cage match is difficult to work with because of how bad the play control is."
3,TV themes,"Not all what I expected, not all of the tunes are the original recordings you remember as the TV themes."
2,NOT original Love Boat theme!,"Some of the themes are originally from the TV shows but I specifically bought this CD because other reviewers claimed that it had the original theme from The Love Boat. If that is the theme you're looking for, don't bother getting this CD."
4,Works great for purposes of purchase,Used this CD to play a game...We work with a lot of Senior Citizens and had them listen to the first bit of a song and had them guess which show it went to. They loved it!
3,Not all that original,"I bought this CD thinking that all the tracks were going to be the original recordings. Some are and some are not. But for the most part, not a bad CD. But if you are looking for all original recordings and not rearrangments, then look elsewhere."
3,Batman and Munsters,"Despite what I've read in many of the other reviews, Batman and the Munsters ARE NOT the original versions that we heard on the intros to the shows themselves. To hear the original themes for those songs, go to the TV Land Theme song home page."
2,Not All Themes Are Originals,"Some of these theme songs are remade and sound pretty lousy in my opinion. Any regular television viewer of these shows can easily distinguish them from originals. I can not recommend this set at all because of this. I made the mistake buying this by believing some MISLeading reviews that said they were ""original themes""-""could not tell the difference from originals""(come on get your hearing checked or watch more classic tv or be more accurate. Other buyers read your reviews for guidance). I cringed at the sound of some of the weird music substituting the original theme song. They should have had the ""fake"" songs on another disc so I could have tossed that one in the trash."
5,Deja Vu,"Listening to these familiar themes as performed by the original artists certainly brings back wonderful memories! I was particularly pleased, not only with the quality of the pieces, but with the actual performances themselves, just as we remembered them!"
5,great deck!,"Lenormand deck exists in 4 versions and can be a powerful tool to predict the future. unfortunately no serious book is available in english to master this little deck. the information booklet will frustrate you because of its simplistic and unpractical approach. But if you are searching for a collection deck and want to study it, you will find it very interesting. one day a english language study book will be available...we can only hope as french and german language ones are quickly out of print or out of stock."
4,"Good, but missing info","This is a book Osprey needed to make and Robert Dorr did a great job. It has information on American and Soviet Aces. The book talks about famous aircraft, like the Mustang, Corsair, Mig 15, and Sabre. The info on Soviet aces was a nice surprise. The facts about British, South African, and Australian aces were an extra bonus. I only wish the book had given info on North Korean and Chinese aces."
2,Cheap polish for a high price,"It had that cheap nail polish chemical smell, went on thin, and dried dull and rough. With three coat I could still see nail through the polish. There was a little bit of glitter in the polish, not enough to make it shiny, but just enough to make the dried texture gritty. The base color didn't have any shine to the finish at all. It's about the quality I expect from Wet n' Wild, but for literally seven times as much money.I'd suggest Essie for the same kind of price range but actual quality in exchange to justify the price. Or, for whimsical colors and a ring included, Hard Candy brand is really nice."
5,Love the Chichester Psalms,"My mom and I sang the Chichester Psalms together with a chorus several years back. She bought me CD as a gift last year, and with this CD I returned the favor. Just lovely!! If you like ""modern classical"" music you will love it!"
2,Misleading title,This book isn't about developing talent in young people. It's more of a statistical and not very well researched commentary on assumed steps taken to achieve an elite level of artistic or athletic ability.
1,Nothing but trouble.,I've used this bike tray for over a year now and it almost cost me a very expensive LOOK carbon fiber bike because it wasn't clamping down enough on the fork to hold the bike securely. I couldn't get it adjusted enough to clamp the fork after less than a year of use so I returned it to my LBS (local bike shop) where I bought it to warranty it. Thule replaced it free of charge but the new one is already showing signs of having the same problem.The manager of the store said they had another customer who has gone through two of these trays already with the same problem as me.There is a serious problem with this product and Thule needs to address it before I will recommend this product to anyone.
1,Cheap leaky bottle,This product arrived in a bubble wrap envelope and the top had leaked so the whole thing smelled like the aftershave. The label had come off but it looked like it was printed on a laser printer. Go with another aftershave.
1,"""Racism"" in a different package",This is probably the worst wrestling book I have ever read. The information is great on many of the wrestlers I have followed. So what the wrestlers are black? This is another example of someone using the race card to cash in. Black people such as myself should shy away from making these liberals rich.
4,This is a replacement part for my kids toy.,"I haven't put it on yet, hopefully it will fit. This part got destroyed easily, wish it was cheaper. It was great to be able to find a replacement."
1,"""Terrible"" does'nt begin to describe this..","Instead of spending money on soulless, assembly-line anime, how about spending money on some decent Anime? This stuff has absolutely no redeeming value. It's pointless, plotless, poorly animated garbage for Ritilin-addicted babies who run around buying anything with ""Pokemon"" slapped on it.Avoid this stuff like the plague that it is!!"
4,Food for the Shepherd,"This is an excellent collection of essays by the greatest preachers in the Reformed tradition today. Some of the topics include The Primacy of Preaching (Mohler), The Teaching Pastor (Sproul), Evangelistic Preaching (Alexander), and The Foolishness of Preaching (Boice). John Piper's essay on Preaching to Suffering People is one of the best things he has ever written and by itself is worth the price of the book ten times over. Derek Thomas' essay on Expository Preaching is full of very good instruction. Joel Beakes' contribution on Experimental Preaching is also excellent. I highly recommend this book for pastors. If you are not a pastor, consider purchasing it for your pastor as a gift. He will be appreciative."
3,"A Good Camping Cookbook, I wanted a Primative Cooking",I was hoping for a Wilderness/Survival type of book that would talk about spit cooking and cooking with hot stones in a pit.A book that talks about cooking the way that comes from the Middle Ages and Indian Cultures would use. This book is for people to go camping.
2,First time this author has missed the mark!,"I'm late to this party, all the good points are taken. So, I didn't like this book very much. I did however finish it, thats something! This author has done some fine work, and I will still wait for his next work with interest.Some of his background for fleshing out this future was amusing but on the whole it seemed rushed to me."
4,Standard Space Opera,"Eagle Against the Stars is standard space opera. Which means that you shouldn't read it to try to find trenchant commentary about important social issues or intellectual musings about the nature of man and society.What you should expect is solid writing, an interesting, fast-paced story line, and a modicum of tension. Oh, yeah, and expect the good guys (us) to beat the bad guys (aliens).Steve White is a fine writer, and his books are generally entertaining, and fun to read. In this book, White has penned an engaging and entertaining bit of sci-fi, that accomplishes exactly what it's designed to do, which is to entertain you with a fast-paced adventure story.IF you like combat sci-fi, you will enjoy Eagle Against the Stars. Steve White has, by the way, coauthored with David Weber, some of the best military Sci-Fi ever written: Insurrection, Crusade, and In Death Ground. This book doesn't quite measure up to those, but it is an engaging read."
2,eagle against the stars,"turttledove! where are you when we need you? this book shows why a little information, in the hands of someone with no historical context, is considered dangerous. if you can keep from laughing at his vision of the future, the book is his standard shoot-em-up of heroes escaping impossible odds again, again, again, and on and on. if your looking for something original, look somewhere else. otherwise it's the kind of science fiction only the texas militia could love."
2,The problem when Libertarian Ideals meet fiction,"I was upset when I read this book. The author's premise is interesting. The aliens show up at a time the Earth First! people have triumphed. What you are supposed to swallow is that the USA would become a distopia under a radical Green agenda and that all the entrepenuerial spirit of the USA would have been beaten out of us. In addition, ALL the power brokers of the time could be taken in by a fast talking con artist.What I also found upsetting was that the pace was so SLOW. For an action book, this is a dud. The characters are good, but the plot is just so bizarre that it makes the book hard to take. You have a situation where the author is pushing a political agenda at the cost of good storytelling."
2,Missed opportunities.,"There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of sci-fi action novels that are good for an evening's entertainment. They read fast, the plot is shallow, and the characters wooden. You aren't disappointed because you didn't expect much.This pretty much describes Eagle Against the Stars. Yet, I was disappointed. White had a chance to take a major theme, the meeting of two cultures, one more advanced and do something interesting. Sort of a Science Fiction version of what happened to Japan when it met the west in the 19th century. I could see a fat book chuck full of details that could keep me busy for weeks.Unfortunately he took the easy way out and wrote a libertarian space opera complete with shallow characters, snide anti Liberal asides and predictable plot. As space opera, its worth reading. Yet, it coulda been a contender.J. A. Schroeder Seattle, WA"
4,nice writing.,he is a wonderful writer who involves you in his world of sci-fi making you live in his world of the future.
5,Entertaining Read!,"Bruce and Stan really shed some insight on the meaning of life in a delightful way. Not only do they share some of the stories they heard along the way, but they give interesting facts and funny stories in the different cities that they visited which I particularly enjoyed. If you're looking for something fun and insightful, you definitely have to pick this one up!"
2,I'm not sure where the author got his wife...,"I bought this book as a textbook for college a three or four years ago. It's a decent book with relevant and helpful information. Relevant and helpful, that is, until you get to the chapter about the pastor's wife. It's quite an egotistical, chauvinistic chapter telling us how the pastor's wife should be clean, dressed up, and make-up done when he gets home for his benefit. The house should be spotless and the kids should be calm and well behaved.Let me tell you, my wife is a fantastic wife and mother, but those are unrealistic and degrading expectations. If she's at home all day every day with my kids, she rarely has time to have the house spotless and her makeup and hair done up. This makes me say, ""No, thanks!"" to this book."
5,A helpful tool for all aspects of the Pastor's ministry!!!,This author combines his years of experience along with his faith in God to produce a book that will definately be a helpful tool for the pastor's library.
2,OK,Wasn't that great compared to her other books. I was a bit dissapointed because I was expecting more of somthing like the Chrestomanci books :(
3,"""A Tale of Time City"", is becomeing very interesting book","My review of this book of what I have read so far, I would have to say it is quite remarkabley good. When I first started reading this book I felt like I was right in the action. Like as you are reading this book you feel like you need to know what is going to happen next. This futurist story book is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I can't wait to finish this book to find out whether ""Time City"" will be saved in time or not."
4,"Very good, but a bit confusing","I loved the Chrestomanci quartet, so when I found this book, I was very excited. I thought it was very good, but a little confusing. The polarities and the time locks confused me, and so did all the references to different centuries as the Icelandic Empire or the reconquest of America and stuff like that. A bit technical and tedious in some parts, but still very good"
4,Wicked,"I first read this book when I was 14 years and I still enjoy reading today, 5 years later whenever I can get my hands on a copy. This well written novel is a challenge for the imagination and has a storyline that is not quickly forgotten. The plot of this book is well thought out and, just when you think that there is going to be disaster things manage to sort themselves out and the world is begun to be put to rights. This story really does make you wonder if our history is really the only history we have ever had or if history really has been changing without us knowing. This is a really good book for making you think! Even now so long after first reading this book, I find myself longing for a taste of butter pies to see just how delicious they are!"
4,The Honourable Crichton,"Collection of very amusing anecdotes and writings from reknown racontuer,editor,wit and fellow member of the legendary Algonquin round table of the 30's and 40's with Robert Benchley. Benchley Quote:""The only immediate cure for a hangover is death!""Highly amusing and entertaining.On a disappointing note, the book has no index.Out of print for ages but you can pick up a good used copy from very good second hand dealers. Highly recommended."
1,Very simplistic and not very informative,"I was really, really disappointed in this book. There is very little information in it, other than the broadest strokes of information about forensics. It is disjointed. Even the photographs are often totally wasted, such as models posed as victims without illustrating *anything* -- just photographs of some guy or girl in a pool of blood, or tied up.ake, for example, fingerprints. There is like one sentence that says, basically, sometimes iodine vapor is used but it turns things brown and is temporary. No photographs of how it is done, when it is necessary, what the chemical reaction is, etc. This book is written for an eighth grader. You will learn more interesting things about forensic science on CSI!"
1,Not One of Nikon's Better Ideas,"This is not a very well thought out unit. It has NO ""on-off"" switch or capability. You have to remove the back plate when you are finished shooting and take the batteries out. You will need to carry extra AAA batteries if you are packing into the National or state Parks. For the money, I would have purchased the Promote Control had I known about this flaw - its does everything the Nikon unit does and more."
4,Not for Nikon D80,Does not work with Nikon D80 :( I am now returning it - the actual product though looks great
4,A must have!,"Before, I was using the timer and every time I hit the shutter button the camera shook just a little and I always had to make some sort of adjustment, or I had to handle the camera for interval shooting. Not any more, with the MC-36 cord I can set everything need for interval shooting, or just be able to shoot without touching the camera at all. I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars because it should have a little pouch to set it in while shooting in interval instead of hanging it off by the cord itself. other than that it's great."
4,Nikon MC-36 Remote Control,"Quality is great, instruction manual is about 1 inch thick with 95% instructions for world wide languages. I tore out all pages except the English instructions. No off/on switch and no sleep mode. The unit is on at all times when in use and not in use. Poor thinking on Nikon's part. Instructions, little as they were, are poorly layed out. If you are going to do time lapse or astronomy this would be a great addition to your Nikon accessories, but the standard shutter release cord from Nikon is only about $50.00 msrp, has a better trigger feel and by using the internal camera shutter opening times is probably a better way to go. And you don't go through batteries."
3,Grossly overpriced,"Pros:Solid construction.Cons:Doesn't do fractions of a second, for the price you pay it should.Outrageously expensive. Nothing is glass or mechanical or high tech electronics, so the price is unwarranted.Doesn't have an off button, so if you forget the program on the batteries will be gone.Cable too short.My conclusion:Go with a cheaper solution (1/4 of the price), there are many out there, some of them wireless."
4,Muy Bueno,"Este control es lo que me recomienda mi camara, por lo tanto no tengo mucho que decir, lo uso regularmente y funciona perfectamente."
4,Mahler Revisited,"I quite disagree with the above two depressing reviews, and would rate this Quadromania retrospective on Mahler at between 3+ and 4 stars. Certainly the sound is somewhat primitive from the 1940's, but if expectations are kept reasonable, the historical significance of these recordings from the Mahler archives by devotees--Metropoulos, Mengelberg, and compatriot Walter-- are ever enlightening and well worth the meagre $2.50 per disc. I don't expect Bernstein, Chailly and Solti from the modern age, but this compilation stays with pride in my collection."
1,Don't Buy!!!,My copy also has an incorrect pitch to the reproduction. The music is altered to the point of complete misrepresentation. I ordered it despite the previous reviewer's warning and will now attempt to return it.
5,A fantastic listening experience!!,"Just a brilliant piece of work from a jazz giant. Two of the best albums Stitt ever recorded on one CD - perfect. There isn't a weakness on the whole CD and anything that has Joel Dorn's sure and steady hand at the back of it is going to be an eminently collectable listening experience. Stitt's touch and tone are sublime and his interpretations are peerless. If you love jazz sax, this is for you. Buy it - you'll be thrilled by it. It's one of the best jazz albums I've ever bought."
4,Interesting.,"""Entertainment Weekly Yearbook 2000"" is a great way to keep track of all the newsmakers from 2000. Makes a nice coffee table book. If you like celebrities and Hollywood, get this book, no matter what the year is currently. I recommend."
4,Memory's Embrace,"This book was pretty good. I must admit, when i read Corbin's Fancy, i thought the continuing with Keith's story would be a little bit more heartfelt. I enjoyed the begining where Tess and Kieth met, what with him yelling up towards the clouds by Tess's interpretation, and then buring his foot by accident while still yelling heavenwards. There were touching scenes, but most of the time, i grew annoyed at Tess's repetitious wording of ""I'm a grown woman"" and Emma's and Rod's really ignorant and selfish characters. I did't really think it was necessary to add the confusion with Emma's deflowering, her mother's insanity, and Keith's injury. But then, if they weren't, the story probably wouldn't have been great as it was. I like your style, Ms. Miller. Continue the good work and hopefully, with more family stories along. =)"
5,Memory's Embrace,"Memory's Embrace is the third of four books in the Corbin series. After losing his wife on their wedding day, Keith turns his back on the church even though he is a preacher. He runs away from his church and family only to find Tess and love again. Another great book from Ms. Miller"
5,Wonderful,"This book was not easy to find, thank to Amazon I could down load to my Kindle. Linda did a wonderful job on this book and I ask everyone to read it. It is just wonderful. Thanks Linda for the hard work.Brenda"
5,Love this series of Books!!,I loved the book Memory;s Embrace and I love this series of books.. No one writes a series like Linda!!I Highly recommend all of her books..
2,No big deal,This battery did not work well for me. It does buy me a little time while recharging the better one. It does not hold charge when idle.
3,smells nice but not worth the premium price,This bubble bath is ok but it's not exceptional (just an average amount of bubbles and they didn't last that long) and it's priced very high. I wouldn't buy it again.
2,This product does not work on Big Headed Ants!,"I bought this product to combat a Big Headed Ant problem in my home. Despite the name, these ants are pretty tiny. They are a nuisance because they can easily get into every square inch of the home. They run along and under base boards and in and out of the tiniest cracks. I am very disappointed with this product because after two weeks, there is no improvement in the ant problem. Sometimes an ant will find the bait and go up to investigate but for the most part, they just scurry on by it in droves. If anyone out there knows of a way to kill big head ants, I am all ears!"
2,Ants everywhere!!,We got these and placed them in our house after seeing a few ants. By the end of the day we had hundreds. This was great! We wanted this. More and more ants came in the house. We started to see them everywhere. It wasn't just a few anymore. There were hundreds if not thousands in our house. That was more than two weeks ago. We did the outside bait houses along with the granules. We now see them everywhere including on our ceiling. The terro did nothing but attract them to our house. It didn't kill all of them. It didn't kill very many of them at all. We called an exterminator who just treated our house with organic product. I should have saved my money and bought called pest control first.
3,Not the same Terro of 30 years ago,"I've only used one of these so far. When we have heavy rains, we often get tiny ants in one of our bathrooms. I did find ants drawn to the Terro that I'd accidentally spilled onto the tile floor, but not enough interest to draw most of them inside the trap.Long ago, Terro sold an unbeatable ant killer gel/liquid. You would put just a bit of it on a piece of cardboard and when placed near an ant trail, it was like a sci-fi film watching the ants turn up.I think the formula contained a deadlier poison than what's used now and whatever else it contained seemed to work much better for attracting the ants.These will probably eventually do the job, but it's definately not the same Terro from years ago or I have very different (finicky) ants now."
1,"brings 'em in, but that's about it","I tried the grants traps and the ants didn't even go near them. I put these Terro traps out and within an hour they were swimming in the stuff and it was an ant orgy. Well, I left these out for five days and the ant trail is still there - not nearly as many but still quite a few. It killed a lot of ants in the traps, but I don't believe it kills the colony. In fact, I think these attracted more ants into my house than if I hadn't put out any traps, and just sprayed them as they came around.I wish I could give this product negative stars. One of the packs must have developed a hole in the bottom and the stuff spilled out and got on the tiles and into the grout joints, making a mess and staining my grout. It's like construction adhesive! Impossible to clean!I still have ants, and a sticky mess to add to it!"
4,Works better than homemade bait,"I usually make my own homemade bait with sugar syrup or corn syrup and Borax, but got desperate and bought this. It has worked GREAT. I've gone from constant ants roaming around my kitchen counters aimlessly (we keep no food out and keep everything totally clean to fight ants) to just one ant in the last 3 weeks. I withheld one star because of that lone ant but I totally recommend this product."
5,best way to get rid of ants,"just one of these knocked out an entire ant population at my apartment within 24 hours, and I have 5 more ""bait stations"" left, so this one purchase will last me for years not having to worry about antsdon't question, just make the purchase if you have any ant problem"
1,Does Not Work,Unfortunately this product does not work because the ants will not go near it to partake of the liquid. The Raid Ant bait does not work either for the same reason so still looking for a remedy.
1,Doesn't Work!,"We have been plagued seasonally, spring and fall, by 'pissant' aka Odorous House Ants (also known around here as J.C ants for the ability to be killed and mysteriously 'resurrect' out of no where!)I ran out and bought this product due to the glorious reviews GUARANTEEING that the ants would march to the bait and carry it back to the nest ant kill the queen.Baloney! I wasted $30 on junk that doesn't work! Indoor and outdoor traps!If there is a money back guarantee from Terro, I will be seeking it.I have had better luck spraying them down with a certain blue window cleaner and had them stay away longer.These baits that say the ants are attracted to liquid, obviously didn't get the memo!I will NEVER waste my money on this JUNK again!"
4,"Reduces ant population, does not eliminate the entire colony","I have argentine ants just outside my home. They come into my kitchen every once a while for food and water. I got so tired of wiping out ants with a cloth. Finally I got fed up and purchased this from amazon. It is a good product that it reduced the ant population significantly. However, I could still see some ant coming into my home and eventually they come back with a vengence, a whole army of them. It seems the terro 300 could not kill the colony entirely. It is either that this late comers are a new colony of ants or they are resistant to the terro 300 now. I later tried placing the terro 1800 right next to the 300. The ants seems to like both bait. However, this time I see no more ants walking around after about 5 days of treatment!!! I DONT KNOW if the terro 300 and 1800 use the same material, but it seems like the combination did the trick!"
5,No ants in less than 6 hours!!!,"I was thinking I would have more time to take video to put up a video review but the little guys after 30 minutes had a 2 foot assembly line to their death. That was at 11:30pm the traps were placed near the power outlet in the kitchen we had seen them around at 11:00pm, I went to bed and woke for work at 6am and I didn't see any ants. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed, watching them work was so fun while it lasted... I had 8 combat ant traps out for the last 3 days and not one ant was seen going into them, a total waste of money, 1 Terro trap took care of all of them. They were little black sugar ants."
1,Effective but Too Messy,So far as I can tell these seem to work OK but you must be VERY careful as you open and place.If they spill even a little the stuff is so sticky it will ruin your carpet or delicate surfaces. It is REALLY easy to spill.I'm going back to other ant killing options.
5,"After ignoring other bait traps, the ants went BERSERK on these","We had tried putting out other ant bait traps for weeks to no effect. One night we started finding a lot more ants in the kitchen, and I knew it was time to get serious. Looking to Amazon, I got these... we put 3 of them on the floor in the kitchen and right away the ants organized into a thick trail and started swarming onto/into/around these baits. It might look like they're stuck in there, but they're actually just gorging themselves on it. The next morning there wasn't a single ant, alive or dead, to be found anywhere -- and it's stayed that way in the week since. Awesome!"
4,Kills those suckers,"This product works. Within 24 hours of placing the traps, I began to see little ant pieces (as if the ants hadexploded) and ants inside of the traps. I've been using the product for about two weeks and while there are still some surviving ants, their numbers are quickly dwindling and I hope they'll all be dead very soon."
5,I love it,"A few days after I put this to use, it was completely filled with ants and some were still going in. I do notice a decrease amount of ants on the trail. I think I just have too many ant colonies at my newly built home so I am back to buy some more. I read somewhere that this type of bait is better in getting rid of ants than spraying pest control directly at the ants. When you directly spray and kill the ants, the ants become alerted, spread out and make even more colonies. So, this bait is less evasive and more effective. Read another review that Home depot sells this for less than $6."
5,Best value of any product I've ever used- for anything.,"Incredibly cheap, simple, and effective. Better design than other similar products. Haven't seen an ant since I used two of these bait stations three months ago."
5,Good Stuff,"This stuff works great, every ant loves it. Every ant DIES! If you start to see a pile of dead bodies, that means its working, but you need to use more because the ants are obviously putting them out of the colony to maintain good housekeeping etiquette."
2,does not work,"It says works on most household ant types, but I see ants walking to the edge then apart. Obviously they are aware of the flavor. So disappointed."
1,It's doesn't work,"I bought the product based on the high review rating. However, it doesn't work at all. Now, I am kind of suspecting some of the reviews are not orbjective due to reviewers' interest from the products."
1,ineffective and messy,"I bought these based on so many positive reviews. I cannot agree.We have had the traps out for 1+ weeks and like one of the other reviews, the traps seemed to attract more ants and never killed any.Further, is the manufacturer trying to save money by making the bait so thin? Of the 6 traps we used, only 3 stayed in tact long enough to measure success. A simple touch and the bait is EVERYWHERE. What a mess. What a waste of time and my money.I am glad to hear about another effective product - Combat Gel. The name seems to explain everything Terro is not."
1,Will NOT work worldwide,"As my title said, this item may only works EFFECTIVELY in USA, but worldwide? I think this company only wants money and sells terrible products because I waited for 4 hours and not a single ant has fallen into this bait. Thank you for wasting my time and money (this product $$ + Shipping from USA - Kuwait via FedEx = $28)"
5,"If you hate ants, GET THIS!!!","Bought these baits in a local store 16 hrs ago, placed them next to an ants trail, immediately ants are somehow attracted by the liquid and goes in the trap to check it out (took less than 3 mins). I've used other ant baits before but never was it this quick that the ants noticed something they like. Next thing i know, i have a swarm of ants drinking the liquid and telling their ant buddies where the food is. 16 hours had passed and I noticed fewer ants than before, but there are still ants constantly going in and out drinking the liquid. I hope by tomorrow or day after tomorrow that all ants will be gone. Will be going back to the store to buy more."
5,This product is fantastic!,"I get these teeny, tiny ants - they love cat food - and nothing worked to get rid of them. After reading these reviews, I found the traps at Loews for $6.38 (incl. FL tax). Just like the other reviewer said: the ants sort of wandered around the trap when I first put it down, but w/i an hour there was a long line to get in and no ants about 24 hours later. What a product!"
5,Works great!,"Within 48 hours, this killed off a colony we have been fighting with in our kitchen for months. It has even attracted carpenter ants and pavement ants when putting these outside. Very pleased with this product and I will never buy any other brand of ant bait again!"
5,Best product available,"I tried several other products before this one and they all failed abjectly. This one got rid of the ants in a mere 8 hours. They swarmed over the baits within 20 minutes and evidently took it to their nest and by next morning they were all gone. Extremely effective, highly recommended."
1,Messy disaster,Ants are clearly attracted as the traps were full within minutes but both traps I put out started leaking and formed a giant puddle outside the trap. Now I just got two big sticky messes covered in ants.
5,Worked great.,"Put 2 of them down next to a hole in our pantry wall where carpenter ants were wandering in. Within a few hours they were SWARMING all over the traps. I let them go to town all day on them, checked on the traps the next day and there were no ants at all. Another day passed and still not a single ant has been spotted anywhere in our apartment.They use ""safe"" borax instead of poison, which is great if you have pets, children or are just worried about harsh chemicals/poisons in general."
5,works in chicago,I live in Chicago and had both the small household ants and larger carpenter ants. This product worked on both ant types within a couple days (used about 4 baits). My apartment has now been ant-free for about 3 months. Will update if they come back.
2,Terro drops are better,"I have had success with the terro liquid, but the ants don't seem to even notice the bait trap is there. Once I put a drop on the counter, they found it immediately. Wish it worked faster. Due to the resilience of our ants and the abundance of spiders this year, we're going to plan a trip to the beach and set off a bug bomb (HotShot Fogger) and hope for a pest-free home. Good luck!"
1,"If you want to kill ants, don't buy this stuff","This stuff attracted the ants but it did not kill them. They used the liquid baits as if they were swimming pools, climbing and climbing out, seeming to have a party. If this stuff is supposed to kill the colony by having the ants take it back to the nest, that didn't work either. After a week of having these baits on the floor where the ants enter the bathroom, there was a slight decrease in ants (and we had millions of them coming in) but then shortly after that they came back. The bathroom floor was Grand Central Station. After 2 weeks of using these and the ants seeming to enjoy them, I threw them out and purchased some ant killing spray, which actually has taken care of the ant problem in less than 24 hours. I don't recommend the Terro baits, they are a waste of money and are messy."
4,The best!,"I had tried many other ant killers before, but non were producing result. Some actually deterred ants from coming close to the containers!This one is for real! I thing ants like it so much that they eat too much & die inside!"
2,Wild birds ate and enjoyed!,"Perhaps baits would have been effective for ants,I will never know. Almost instantly the backyard birds were at them. I do have a feeder with black oil sunflower seed, so we are not talking hungry robin's walking the patio. The birds are unharmrd but the ants remain."
5,kills wave after wave,"This stuff works. Active ingredient Borax is the same Borax that some people might use to clean their bathtubs, so it is relatively safe. Just don't go eating the stuff and you should be fine. Kills wave after wave of ants as the queen hatches more, without spraying harmful chemicals in your house. Only drawback is that as ants die, they might accumulate in certain areas. Highly recommended."
1,STOP THE BS!,"I've been using two boxes of this product! I replaced them every two/three days. Every time I placed new ones, it's like I was throwing them a freaking wild party! I observed a little bit and even saw two queen ants coming to have fun! It's been two weeks already and I start to use the third box! C'mon guys, give me a break with all those hypes!My obsevations matched with a few folks here. The product becomes useless after two to three days. Somehow, the ants are smart enough not to eat old foods! The product becomes so much thicker that the ants can run around on the surface after three days. The company advices to replace their baits every three months? huh?I give three stars because I don't know if the product actually works or not. For me, it certainly does not work after two weeks!04/11/2011 - DOES NOT WORK. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. PERIOD. STOP THE HYPES! You need to find the source of where the ants come from. It should be somewhere outside your house (front/back/side yards)."
1,Just keep coming,"After 2 weeks and 2 ant traps, I have decided to peacefully coexist with my friends. Sure, these ant traps have attracted a steady flow of ants into my house, but they don't seem to be lessening in numbers. They just keep coming and coming. Oh well- winter will kill them all in 6 months or so."
1,disappointed,"i placed this product several locations in my livingroom. For a week, i still have ants being around and have not seen even a single ant showing interest in the bait(s). They just ignore them.Terrible experience. First time for me that any product i ever bought not completely working at all."
1,Not effective,"Used for almost a month, and didn't do anything. Finally bought some Raid spray, and that killed them in 5 minutes."
1,COME AND GET IT!!,"I have to go with the other reviews here....Seemed to be working at first, now for the last week they just line up to eat it. Lots of dead ants in the trap, but it's not stopping more from coming.... Immune perhaps?"
3,Cliched but sweet,"The Grass Widow is a story of survival and unexpected love, set against a back drop of post-Civil War Kansas. Unwed and pregnant Aidan is sent across the country from her comfortable home in Maine, to distant family in Kansas. Upon arrival in Kansas, she meets the rough and tumble Joss; a trouser wearing, gun toting woman. Life is hard out, but with determination they try to hold their own.Nancy Little has written a very touching story of two women finding love and acceptance. While often clichéd, I did find myself invested in Aidan and Joss; I cared what happened to them, and the farm. However, I don't feel that the other characters received the same attention, they were flat and underdeveloped.Overall, while the clichés and dialect tended to feel slightly campy, this story really was quite sweet and enjoyable."
4,Brock is back and the gang see a new pokemon!,"Ash, Misty,and Brock start on the Johto League. In the first episode, the gang helps Officer Jenny get a stolen Totodile back before the trainer comes to pick it up. In the second episode, Ash teaches a baseball-pokemon trainer that being friends with your pokemon isn't just bossing them around. And in the third episode the Pincher start invading the Hercross forest."
2,Passable pic,What can I say Kevin Sorbo IS easy on the eyes. The story is easy to follow and not too bad.
3,Made For TV?,"I've seen far worse when it comes to ""disaster"" style films. This one is a ""middle of the road"" film. It has it's good parts and some slooow parts. Not a high budget film, but the special effects are not bad. Fair acting overall. This has the feel of a made-for-TV movie but I'm not sure if that's the case. It *sure* isn't worth the high price that is asked here on this site."
3,A Fairly Good Disaster Flick,"For the disaster flick fan this is a worthwhile watch; it covers the bases fairly well without slipping over into the horror flick category which I've seen too many of them do. The story is set in Texas in the vicinity of Eustace and was actually filmed in Dallas, Eustace, and French Lick, Indiana; the caves are all in Indiana I imagine.The movie is well paced and never seems to get too bogged down; the CGI is adequate and the sound is acceptable. The actors do a convincing job and I didn't have the problem with Jake that at least one of the reviewers did. By and large the overall acting is somewhat better than average for this sort of disaster flick.I would suggest watching it before buying it although it may hold up well enough for repeated viewings."
2,Use of a cave?,They use a cave to film a lot of it trying to give the impression its deep. They also use 4 wheelers to enter the mine/cave but seem to forget they have them to escape with.
1,Pitiful,"We are big Kevin Sorbo fans, so we anticipated a great night at the movies with Fire Down Below. To say it was a big disappointment would be an understatement. It was one of the most poorly written and acted movies we've seen in a long time. Sorry Sorbo. We wouldn't even give Fire Down Below away as a gift...white elephant, maybe.But we bought 3 of Sorbo's ""What If"" movies for gifts. It is WONDERFUL!"
1,Death Stick - D160 DOTIC,On 18 May I bought a 14oz. titainum death stick. It has been less than a month and the waffles on the head are worn out. There is a big nick in the claw between the forks. It should be at least 18oz. The handle feels good. I will be taking this hammer back for a refund.
5,First Class Table-Top Tripod,"I am very happy with this product. Even better than I expected. It is very solid and should support almost any camera thanks to its wide legs. And though I have not yet used it as a tripod with legs braced against my chest, I have practiced this and am confident the camera will be much steadier than if I were to hold the view finder to my eye in the normal manner. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a table-top tripod."
5,"Nice Murph, If You Can Get It.","This is a great collection, but sadly, it is out of print and doesn't seem to be available ANYWHERE (though, I guess that could change at any time). I'm sure a copy will surface at some point on E-b**, so you might want to check there regularly. But I'm pretty sure everything here is at least available through Murphy's other CDs, and there are far worse investments than buying all the individual Murphy CD's you'd need to collect these same tracks. Not a bad track in the bunch, and an electic variety, as another reviewer indicated."
3,great to wear as long as not wearing a helmet,"I bought these to have for motorcycle class. they were very reasonably priced so I bought them. the clarity is great. the fit is comfortable; however, if you are wearing a helmet, as in my case, the glasses were a problem. the fit was very tight with the helmet on. the sides of my head were killing me. maybe the sides are a bit too wide with a helmet on. also, when I had the helmet on, they fogged up so I couldn't see. I would have to pull them so they werent as close to my face so they would de-fog.obviously in real life, this could pose a problem. I think they are great to wear as long as you don't have a helmet on. but, this is just what happened to me and may not a be a problem for someone else."
4,Lamott's Works,"I have read all of Anne Lamott's works and find each and every one down to earth, revealing of the soul and true to life. Reading ""Rosie"" and ""A Crooked Little Heart"" my heart broke and at the same time acknowledged the same feelings of life growing up. In ""Hard Laughter"" I found myself reliving my own father's illness and eventual death to lung cancer and the dark humor that runs with deep grief. I look forward to Anne Lamott's next piece of literature."
2,This was a BIG disappointment!,"I haven't felt this way about a book in more than 20 years -- it was a real stinker. This book needed an editor so badly; I felt like I was reading Lamott's first draft. Non-sequiturs abound and puzzling phrases left my face with a permanently perplexed look. I found myself saying ""come on"" out loud on more than a few occasions. For example, one chapter begins, ""One day at the beginning of June, when it was so hot that the only things moving outside were the crickets and the anorexics..."" Come on! Is that supposed to be funny? This book was not nearly as funny and charming as ""Rosie"" -- even though Elizabeth's lethargy often left me aggravated in that book. I felt I owed it to the characters in ""Rosie"" to find out what happens in ""Crooked Little Heart."" Well, that will be the end of that allegiance"
3,A disappointing book by a normally very funny author,I read Bird by Bird by Lamott and loved it! I was so looking forward to reading this book and had read several good reviews. I was very disappointed and really didn't care what happened to any of the characters. And not much happens to any of them! I would skip this book and read Operating Instructions instead -- another great book by Lamott
1,A poor introduction to Anne Lamott,"I decided to read this book because I have read much critical parise of Ms. Lamott's other books and I am a fan of ""coming of age"" stories. This was an unfortunate introduction to Ms. Lamott's writing. I found the novel heavy handed and repetitive. In this novel, Ms. Lamott too often uses repeated (ad nauseum) physical descriptions (e.g., Rosie is gangly and pigeon toed) of her characters as a substitute for character development. If the characters were fully developed we would not have to be hit over the head with repeated descriptions for them to be remebered and live in our minds."
2,sorry i don't agree,"I have enjoyed Anne Lamott on local radio and looked forward to reading her novel. It was very frustrating. Rosie and her issues rang true and were well written, couldn't really stand most of the other charachters. Especially long drawn out descriptions of James and Elizabeth marital issues. Sheesh felt a great waste of my time. Would have been a great short story"
2,An extremely irritating read!,"It's really a shame. This could have been a good book. I really enjoyed the storyline on Rosie, but became very ill as I was continually subjected to her mother's angst. I realize that she'd had some difficult things to overcome in the past, but, HELLO, time to consider current blessings. I couldn't wait to leave their home, and I found myself wishing Rosie luck."
5,This was a book that blew me away,"I read Rosie first and really liked it, but ""Crooked Little Heart"" was a novel that I wanted to crawl inside and live in for a while. Lamott writes about things of the spirit, things of the soul, so poignantly that I felt that I really gained some knowledge about myself by reading about Rosie, Elizabeth, Rae, and James. And that is what I hope for most as a reader -- a book that I can bring something of myself to. I loved this book so much I have it displayed on the top of my bookcase."
5,"A very engaging, home-hitting work of art","I was hooked on Crooked Little Heart as soon as I met thirteen-year-old Rosie. I recognized the glazed over eyes and wall around her heart as the ones I encounter daily with my fourteen year old daughter. With this novel, I felt right at home. Lamott's exploration of the darkness and the light in Rosie, her mother Elizabeth, her friend Simone, stepfather James and the family's close friends also reflected back at me. I felt validated in my triumphs and troubles. The solitary act of reading gave me the companionship of many. I enjoyed Lamott's insights into the world of junior tennis tournaments, the solace of nature and the ways grief can hang around and hold us down. Crooked Little Heart put me in touch with myself. For that I'm grateful."
2,Weak story line and not credible characters.,"I was very disappointed in this book, after having read Rosie. I felt that the character development was weak, and the story line meandering and too often boring. I forced myself to finish this book, mainly because I kept thinking it was going to pick up. Lamott has a great command of language, which makes this book even more frustrating to read since I felt often that she got too caught up in descriptive passages and not in the soul of the story she was trying to tell. It had so many of the right elements but ultimately did not hold together as a richly told tale that could capture the reader's heart."
2,Needs a parental rating,"This was assigned for entering 9th graders as summer reading. The story of a dysfunctional family (alcoholism, child abuse) is maudlin enough on it's own. The author apparently thinks that teenagers need to be exposed to graphic sex and X-rated language to relate to the dilemmas of growing up. I found the story tedious, the language unimaginative and the message simplistic. Skip this one!"
3,"Beautifully written, but just not to my taste","After a slow start, I gradually fell in like with the writing style and people in this coming-of-age novel. I say ""in like"" because I have discovered I'm not overly partial to character-driven novels. Still, Lamott writes gorgeous descriptive sentences and uses lovely similes. Her grasp on the dynamics of a blended family and the social pressures on modern teenage girls seems effortless and without artifice.It's a nice piece of work and well worth reading. It's just not to my taste."
3,Oh well...everyone has an off day sometimes.,"I held off on reading this latest book by Anne Lamott because I loved the anticipation of yet another delicious dive into the world she creates on paper. I relished the vibrancy of Rosie, which I read several years ago and looked forward to more of the same in Crooked Little Heart. Unfortunately, this doesn't feel like a sequel.....in Rosie everything and everyone was immediate and engaging. This book feels like it was written underwater and is keeping all the delectable characters at arms length with lengthy and unfocused prose. Like I said, everyone has an off day and I will keep reading everything Lamott writes....but I felt sad that the people I met in Rosie never resurfaced in this volume."
4,totally kewl!,This book was just totally kewl! I couldn't believe. It just seemed to draw me into the book. Rosie is a very interesting character. A little bit of everything happens in her life. I loved the book and can't wait to read more.
3,Unfortunately my first Anne Lamott,"Judging by most of the reviews, others found the nonfiction works by Ms. Lamott very entertaining. Perhaps I'll enjoy one of those more, because I thought this book was mediocre. The characters were so whiny, neurotic, and self-obsessed that I didn't really care about any of them."
3,A lot of skin but not the usual skin flick,"In the usual skin flick, a female staffer and the male director(?) don't occasionally step into the scene and comment on making the movie. Another viewing may help me figure out what these people are down to."
4,A blast from the past,"This has become an immediate and important addition to my CD collection, and I am not letting it leave the house! I was talking with a co-worker about music and records ""back in the day"" and we kept going back to this album and how we both played it over and over. I saw it on line and purchased two copies (the price was definitely right!) and gave him one. It took us old heads back to our late teens-early 20's. I haven't told anyone else I know about it,'cause I'm not ready to share or lose it (my album was stolen and my tape was given to someone who ""had to have it""). My co-worker has already gotten two requests to burn a copy for his friends."
3,It is pretty good.,It was pretty good except it did not have any of the cast from the tv show ecept Richard Green.It would have been much better if they had kept the orginal cast.
4,I JUST TRYED ONE AND IT SOUNDED SO GOOD I BROT IT HOME IS SOUNDS SWEET,THE BRIDGE SADEL PICKUPS SOUND SO THIN THIS ONE SUONDS LIKE MOOR NATRUAL IT HAS A GOOD LOW END SOUND. GOOD JOB NO FRETI CANT WHATE TO TRY IT ON MY CHURCH SOUND SYSTEM . THATS THE REASON I GOT IT WE ARE DOING A ACUSTIC SET AT MY CHURCH THIS CRISTMAS SUNDAY.THANKSALEX
5,"volume levels yes, but still...","Granting the problematic change in volume levels at the start (perhaps the singer is meant to be heard from offstage?), this is a pearl of a little-known opera.Don't be scared off. It is NOT 'unlistenable.' DO NOT turn up the volume for the very, very quiet first aria, and you'll be fine."
3,"Beautiful opera, but recording volume too extreme...","I am not a sophisitcated opera afficiando. My love of opera is limited mostly to the operas I recall my father listening to on Sunday afternoons, Madame Butterfly, Aida, Tosca, and Cavalleria Rusticana. Cavalleria is my favorite, but unfortunately, this recording is not.The volume extremes make it essentially impossible to listen to and enjoy. Listening in my car (a Jaguar XJ12), if the volume is loud enough to hear the softer portions, then when the louder portions arrive, I'm nearly scared into having an accident. I think my point is important to consider because nowadays about the only place you can listen to opera is in a car.I'm online now to buy a different recording."
1,NOT WaterResitant or WaterProof or even WaterTolerant,"I paid $200 for the CD version of this shower radio, and I have regretted it since the first day of trying it out in the shower. This is by far the worst consumer electronics product that I have ever made the mistake of purchasing. It cannot handle being near water -- not in the shower stream, near the shower head, or near water that is splashing from your head. On the back of the radio it has more holes than a porcupine turtleneck. It is not just overpriced, it also needs some serious reengineering. Ten or fifteen yeaers ago, Sharper Image had the coolest and latest high tech stuff, what happened?"
3,Good Resource,"This is a good book for those seeking an understanding of the rudimentary foundation to ayurvedic living...I am glad I did buy it, as it is informative and will helpful, I haven't has my baby just yet to recognize what dosha my baby is..."
3,Electro Jazz,"I follow large music as a dj so i am glad to see them starting to put out CD releases. This is a great chill-out cd, but has a lot of soul. The top cut for me is DJ RaSoul Soul Searching...so deep with a killer baseline."
5,Required reading for female professionals,"If you have any interest in improving the corporate environment for yourself and other women, you should read this book. Not only does Carolyn S. Duff provide concise, research proven techniques on how to take advantage of a mentor situation, she covers the spectrum of mentoring pitfalls and provides solutions to overcome them. This book is timely and fresh. I believe it should be required reading for all female professionals."
2,I wanted to love this product,"I bought the tea bags thinking this is the perfect way to use my herbs as tea. Right?Wrong! Though the tea bags themselves are perfectly OK, and do the job, the package comes with ONE plastic toothpick-like bag holder and it's cheap plastic and a quite ugly brown color.So, forget about ""tea for two"", because you can't use the bags without the toothpick-thingy.And if it gets lost or accidentally thrown away (which can easily happen, as it is so unimportant-looking), then you have teabags with no way of placing them in your cup."
2,Almost but not quite....,"I bought this tool for it's seemingly small size, it would pocket easily.The issue is that this tool is too short to be an effective lever. Notice in the photo, the radius opposite the lifting end. It's too sharp to be an effective lifting agent. When it does, it usually rips the edge out of the drywall, because the weight of the drywall is sitting on a very small lip. Not that broken drywall can't be fixed...but what a time sink. The rasp is as reported...in effective. A hand held surform (Stanley 21-399 Surform Pocket Plane) outperforms...hands down in every instance.On the flip side, the tool has a small lifting ledge, that works as a scraper or small prybar on solid objects that are not prone to breakage. The mass of the Pocket Kicker works well if you don't want to mar a surface when hitting with a hammer.This tool is not well designed when lifting a 4x8(+) sheet of drywall."
1,not ok for professionals.,I am a drywall who hangs six day a week and was looking for something like this. when I saw 5/8 on there I thought great. so I got one. (to the person/s who made this product.) You should have tested it first because unless you weight 200lbs or more you can not hold a 4x12 sheet of drywall 1/2 let alone 5/8.my rating on this product is don't waste your time.
3,Perfect for the homeowner for patching drywall.,"I purchased this pocket kicker for a small, upstairs, rough framed storage room I was finishing as a weekend project. I figured,""hey, kill two birds with one stone."" As it turns out, this tool is not suited for the job of drywalling even a small room. As a previous reviewer stated, the rasp edge does not take material off aggressively. To fit pieces snugly, drywallers often cut some sheets for such a tight fit that an edge rasp is needed to get a good fit. The pocket kicker is not suited to this task. You will tire your arms out in no time if you attempt such. As a kicker, this tool is horrible, it is to narrow to be effective. Sheetrock tears on the bottom (not a huge deal, but annoying) and it is difficult to keep the kicker in place while fastening the sheets. Not a bad tool to have in the home tool kit for repairing and patching, but not suited to hanging an entire room."
4,Great little tool,"There was one odd feature that surprised me. On the opposite side of the tool where the patent info is printed (see enlarged photo), there are printed three crosses, a Jesus fish and a scripture reference. If you need to hang a door or pry up wallboard then you won't be disappointed, unless you don't like your hardware to proselytize to you."
5,pocket kicker,I put in 5 doors without help because the pocket kicker helps pick up door using my foot.
4,Good tool,Compact light weight fits in tool pouch does the job.I have had mine 5 or 6 years. Made in the USA.
5,Album of the Year,"This album joins Spock's Beard's ""Snow"" as music that defies labels and stereotypes. Greatness."
3,Too much religious lyrics,"The whole album sounds like a Sunday morning at the church. And that's the same for Testimony #2. The music is great though, so it's worth the 3 stars.I find super boring to listen to these lyrics. God god god god everywhere.Luckily, Neal doesn't do that with Transatlantic."
2,Not another Jesus album!?!,"I have always loved Spock's Beard, I love Transatlantic, and ""Snow"" is truly a remarkable achievement in music. However, as much as I realize that Spock's Beard was really Neal Morse, I just couldn't get into this Jesus-has-saved-me album.Musically, the album is fine. Lyrically, a real turn off."
5,Not merely for the ears...,"This is amazing stuff. Music for the heart, not only for the ears. Morse met Jesus and found LIFE. This music is incredibly alive!"
5,Amazing,"I have long been a Neal Morse and Spock's Beard fan. When the Beard released their new cd, I was let down. It was obvious that Neal's presence was missed. Now that Testimony is here, I remember what I love so much about Neal's music. Neal has a way of taking you on a musical journey. With Testimony we get awesome musicianship along with moving lyrics. Testimony leans more towards a Transatlantic sound rather than Spock's Beard, but it is different also. The album is heavy in orchestration. It is very powerful. The lyrical content is really good. Neal is telling his personal story and tetimony of how he came to know Jesus. Some have said that it is churchy, but since this is the things that he has experienced in his journey, he must express them how he saw and felt them, be it churchy or not. I am very impressed and excited. If you are a Neal Morse fan, you will not be let down. If you are looking for great music with a great message, then check this out!"
1,Crappy Christian Faux-Progressive Rock,"I hate this disc for the same reason I thought Snow was the worst disc ever by Spock's Beard (and I really, really liked SB until that disc...honestly). Terribly awkward lyrics, clichéd prog licks...simply embarrassing. This is prog rock for people that didn't actually grow up with old-school prog rock like ELP, KC, Yes and old Genesis. Awful, just awful. Throw your $ in the street instead of buying this...you'll end up feeling better about yourself in the long run. I'm sure we'll see poor Neal on the PAX channel before too long. No wait, even they'll think this sucks."
2,"Jesus Saves? Not for me, not for this cd","I bought this record because I'm a great Dream Theater fan. Outside the box was incluided a banner: ""The new progressive masterpiece from Spock's Bear lead man with Mike Portnot at drums"". I imagined, this cd will be awesome... Big mistake!! It's full of preaching about the existence of God and how Morse try to brainwash us. The only pro here is that Portnoy plays his drums like always.. Excellent. Better download ""Interlude"" and all the Intermissions, you'll appreciate a true drummer. Don't waste your money on this crap."
3,My Testimony....,"First, I will start off by saying I've been a huge Beard fan since ""The Light"" (their first CD). Neal Morse has always been an inspiration to me , as a prolific songwriter and musician. He has created, IMHO, some of the best prog work in recent times with ""Day For Night"", ""Kindness of Strangers"" and ""V"". I was dissapointed with ""Snow"", in terms of lyrical content and song structure...I found the ""2 hour format"" as sounding forced at times. Neal's solo effort ""Testimony"" , continues along this path. Only now, Neil's new found Christianity, is his central theme.This disk needs to establish an identity- it struggles at times between brilliant prog and light Christian music, but does not really do justice to either.....I think Neal should deliver his messages of faith in a Christian Music focused product and still produce creative prog pieces ala ""Healing Colors of Sound"", ""Flow"", ""Stranger in Your Soul"" etc....Not sure Neal's new ""Testimony"" is clear to all of us."
5,Simply Brilliant,"I won't try to add anything to the reviewers that have given this two CD set an excellent rating. I have been listening to progressive rock for many years, and this is one of the very best I have heard. If you enjoy anything Neal has ever done, buy this CD. Unless you are one of those people who hate any mention of God or Christ, you will not be sorry."
5,Masterpiece,"I don't know just what qualifies a piece of music as a masterpiece, but if this is not it, I don't know what is!!!"
2,No longer pink.,"Actually, my first disappointment in this watch was how stiffly it stands above my wrist and consequently, is always slipping to the inside of my wrist. Then, the pretty pink resin band rapidly discolored with a greenish gray cast all over, as if I'd rubbed it in grass clippings. On the plus side, it still works, the buttons are great and the lens hasn't scratched at all, but overall, I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Feels Like a New Day,"Found a set problem exercises from the 1964 course. According to the intro ""one-half the exercises was suggested by R.P. Feynman.""Alas, no solutions. Which is troublesome when there are often so many different ways to solve a problem. It's sad to think that Feyman's exact problem-sovling techniques and methods have not been put down in widely accessible print."
1,"No substance, only trite snippets of trivia","My only hope is that this booklet is printed on recycled paper. I would shudder to think that even a tree branch perished for its printing. This is a collection of truisms of no substance, such as: ""The purpose of the venture is profit, which results when income exceeds expenses"" and ""Did you know? Home ownership carries many benefits, taxwise."" If you need the information in this booklet you need to question your capabilities to be in business."
4,Hilarious CD,"Bob Ricci's CD is hilarious and rivals that of Weird Al and other parody writers. The songs are funny and catchy and go along well with their originals, but different enough. I know some of his parodies better than the real song. The CD is a little old, so it could be hard to come by, but is worth the investment if you are a fan of parody music."
4,Great Text,"In my opinion, this is one of the better books available for soil scientists, geomorphologists, and engineering geologists who need a good desk reference book on soil pedogenesis and landforms. The only weakness is the dearth of discussion on landslides and their role in landscape development."
3,It's good movie for Govinda's fan,"Rajan gets Geeta pregnant and wants her to get an abortion, but Geeta refuses, and gives birth to a baby boy and leaves him in an orphanage. Fate plays a strange trick and the baby is adopted by Geeta and her new husband ACP Anand, who are led to believe that the child is Anand's. Rajan goes abroad and loses touch with Geeta. Things start to heat up when the baby, all grown up, starts working with Rajan who has now returned from abroad, and taken to crime."
4,College Radio Rock,"This CD is early Southern Jangle pop rock from NC in late 1970s. If you like crude garage band music, this is it. These guys went on to form Let's Active and the dB's a few years later. Good music, but never made it to mainstream."
1,Where are the proofs?,I went to my daughter's high school open house last week. Shewill be taking honors geometry next year. I scanned thisbook and I couldn't find any proofs. What the math teachereffectively told me was that most people hated proofs sothey were removed and were replaced by paragraphs and posters.I was a math major and I remember loving proofs. Most peoplewho like math have always enjoyed the proofs. I have decidedto home school her in geometry next year as a result of this.
2,very hard to understand,this book is very hard to understand for a student who knows nothing about geometry. it is an inductive approach which means that the author intended for the student to have to think about what to do for the next step in a specific lesson. it does not tell you what to do. only with a teacher of mathematics or geometry can a student understand geometry by using this book.
1,I HATE THIS BOOK!!!!,"OMG! This book was so complicated to understand. They expect you to know everything. Because of this mindless crap, I failed Geometry and had to take the regular one. And the worst part is that they don't include enough examples to explain how to work the problem. I wouldn't recommend this God forsaken piece of crap to anyone who wants to do good in Geometry."
2,More of the same...with drums,"I keep giving Steven Roach a chance...and asking myself why. I'dig' ambient music but honestly have little interest in what sounds like a guy with a synth holding random chords for several bars at a time. That's largely what this sounds like to me, with percussion thrown in this time. Honestly I'm glad I only paid $4.99 and that was only because of my interest in all things Fripp. I wish I could discern just where his contributions are to this project...."
4,Quick and Tasty,"I keep buying this product, so I must like it. It is important to find the correct cooking time with your own microwave oven. The suggested time on the package ranges between 4 - 5 1/2 minutes. After experimenting, I found that 4 1/2 minutes works best with my oven. After cooking the pasta in its plastic bowl, plop it into a ceramic bowl to eat. It's better."
4,easy inexpensive snack,"Betty Crocker's Pasta Alfredo style Bowl Appetit! is a quickly-prepared, tasty, nicely textured and inexpensive snack, even alone by itself. It's even better with a chunk of cheese melted into it and a salad or a few veggies on the side. The package claims ""No Preservatives or Artificial Flavors,"" so I'll trust that info. However, for most contemporary tastes it may be a tad salty. On the other hand, though I'm not writing a separate review, the Herb Chicken Vegetable Rice does not make it at all, but has a not very pleasing texture and a totally yuck, salty, artificial flavor. You win some and you lose a lot, but I'd definitely advise stocking up on a supply of Pasta Alfredo."
4,We Love These,"Great for HS or College kids on the go. Um, even if they don't know how to, like, ""cook."" Everybody has a microwave and water ..."
3,decent book but not worth the price,"First let me state that the book is written in a old style that would make a reader think that its was printed entirely by a type writer. Every paragraph seem to be cram together with no space between paragraphs ,and it stress the eyes cause everything is so cram in one page. If you dont mind the cram text them this book should not poses a problem. As for the material the book does provide good sample test but the only issue that i would have with this is that the explanation of the answers on the book are not given at the end, which could give readers a frustrated time in knowing why a certain is chosen. Finally the price for this book is outrages!!! why would they charge this much is acid mind. Not for the price i would say 20$ is the most."
1,Nice Features But...,Pros: Nice features.Cons: Very poor audio quality. Only will receive 2 FM and one SW channels outside of City limits. My $5 portable radio works much better in same areas.
2,"Worked OK for a while, then died","This radio worked OK for a few months. I only used it at home, running it off of AA batteries. The crank worked fine--didn't try to run it off of solar. But the thing died when I took it camping. Left it in the truck and the humidity apparently messed it up. Couldn't change channels or switch from AM to FM to SW, etc. Trashed it and won't be buying another. Cheap plastic disposable Chinese junk that's absurdly over priced."
1,Useless,"This product is essentially useless. It picks up only the strongest signals and it doesn't matter what band you are on. In our area we have an FM news, weather, and traffic station that has two frequencies that we can tune into, this radio will pick up neither of them. It picks up absolutely no weather bands.If you are lucky your favorite radio station will come in, and the crank and solar cells work (but not for very long or very well).The best part about this radio is the light on the end of it which is very bright and will work with DC/AC/or crank."
1,Weatherband reception unsatisfactory,"I just received the radio, and most of the functions work OK, but the weatherband reception is unsatisfactory. Using a different radio (Midland WR300) I can get three or four weather broadcasts very well, but with the KA009 I get noise and some FM-band stations when trying to tune a weather station on the weather band.I'm ready to return this new radio. Amazon's instructions are to send it back to Kaito. Unfortunately, Kaito's web site has no information about returning products."
2,Not impressed,The reception is good but the antenna breaks off really easy and then you're stuck until you fashion one for it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I like. For the price I expected more quality.
1,Not a great product,"This radio is sub-standard. I also own Eton, and enjoy it, but did not have the short-wave option so I bought the Kaito. The squelch is so strong, it is hard to even receive the weather channel. Would not buy this product again, ever."
5,The Doctor will see you now.,"When I got this game, I had NO idea how to play it. When I started playing it, though, I found it was another ""matching 4"" game. {BORING!} So, I started matching EVERY 4 colors EVERYWHERE. I saw I wasn't getting anywhere. THEN, on a match I made, I noticed a creature to the left of the screen disappearing. {AH-HA!} That means there IS a method to the matching. You match the colors of the surviving creatures. I think, since I play a Doctor, & I am throwing pills, they must be viruses. THAT made it a LOT more fun!"
4,Glory days!,The cartridge that I receive looked like it had its days. But it worked well just the same. Please forward me a manual to defeat my wife in this game! :)
2,A classic? No way!,"Dr. Mario is a sad excuse for a NES and arcade classic. This wanna be Tetris is terrible and brings dishoner to our console games. The concept of fighting strange viruses is weird (I'll give it to the creators, it's original.) The graphics are so-so and my least favorite format; on the virge of 8-bit and 16-bit. The music is catchy but the sound of it is an irritating screech. Those of you who like this, go for it. It is also too difficult for players and the worse part is that this is going to be in jewel cases! Whazup wit dat?"
4,Callin' Dr. Mario into sugery!,"Dr. Mario was created for two reasons. First reason was to captialize Mario even further and expand him on more than adventure games. Second reason was to target a audience younger than ten years old who may find Tetris a tedeious and/or difficult puzzle game. Even to this day at 29 years old) I'm not that good at tetris so I found Dr. Mario a colorful, easy, happy, and exiciting alternative to take on. Since 1990, I had fun with blowing out viruses by simply applying the capsules that matches the color of each virus. Unlike Tetris, its a two player game of which you get to challenge your friends to see who can wipe out the viruses first. I had to buy a copy off amazon because I misplaced the original cartridge that I got when it first came out. There is no cure for this nolastagic fever!!"
4,great memeries!,great puzzle game!! can't beleive it still keeps me entertained after 20 years good times!! great value for it's price!! great for any mario fan you won't be sorry.. :-P
5,Dr. Mario,"Another old favorite from a bygone era. Had this game in the early 90's for my original NES, and I can still sit and play it for hours. Just comforting."
1,Terrible condition!,"Did not work! Kept freezing! I never had luck with this game as a kid playing it from renting it, either!"
4,Great CD,"This CD is a great mix of easy to listen to music with some more upbeat, some more soothing. I enjoy listening to it to relax and unwind as well as to get moving for the day. Great CD for in the car, home, anywhere."
4,A Good Stasheff Read,"I like Stasheff and this book is not exception. The one thing it did, however, was make me wish that I could get my hands on a copy of the original book so I could compare it with the rewrite!"
2,not as good as the original,"JReliga is incorrect. King Kobold was published in the USA but did poorly in sales. I had a copy and am trying to locate another. The rewrite did away with some key characters who show up in subsequent books, and so gives us no exposition of those characters."
3,Jerry Baker Year round gardening,I like the information but I was suppose to be able to print Jerry Bakers recipes to my printer but as of yet that has not happened. The program won't open using the information provided with the dvd.
2,Not practical for large yards,I was really excited about this until I sat down with the recipes and started calculating how much beer and soap I would have to buy to fertilize my 6 acres. Even 3 acres would be ridiculous.
4,Nice coffee table book,"It's a very large book with some lovely photos in it. I can't give it a completely fair review because I just haven't a chance to sit down, really look at the photos, and read the text. I bought it after we had just returned from Israel, and it shows a lot of areas we weren't able to visit."
1,Disregarding an international border,"I dropped in at a Borders book store, spotted the series of Beaux Arts Editions, picked up the volume ""Spectacular Israel"" and sampled a couple of pages - without exception, breathtaking pictures. But then I looked at a map of Israel that stretched from the Mediterranian Sea to Jordan... no trace of the Occupied Territories. Someone who viewed the book before me must also have became aware of the terrible ommission and crudely sketched in the borders of the Gaza Strip and the West Bankand. I was outraged over this land grab (I know plenty of Jews support it) and reported my finding to the store manager (Borders). No matter how beautiful the book but when it so bluntly disregards international borders it has immediately lost its attraction, al least to me. There ARE priorities in my choices..."
3,Physical Rehabilitation,"This book is very interesting and alot of great knowledge. The only down fall is the pages are too thin and that makes it hard for high lighting. The expensive cost of these books should make better pages, because they also rip easily."
5,GOOD TO HAVE FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY,"This charger is very convenient in case your cell phone runs out of juice. It even has a flashligt!It gets hot and will take forever to chage your cell, good for emergencies only!I DOWNGRADE IT TO 3 STARS!"
3,Too much of the same,"I have really enjoyed some of Kay Hooper's previous books, and perhaps if this were my first I would have enjoyed it more. The problem is that all of Hooper's books are beginning to seem identical. There's no longer any suspence and even the romance is so much formula that its unappealing. For a quick beach read this is acceptable."
5,very entertaining,I really enjoyed this book. Kay Hooper is a very good writer.I suggest that anyone who wants a suspense to read this.
5,Good read,"This is my first Kay Hooper book and I am hooked! I couldn't put the book down so I read the whole thing and then when out and got another, Stealing Shadows, and all of last night I was reading!!!I love her style of writing and the subject matter... I love suspense especially with a paranormal aspect! She is wonderful!"
2,I read it a few weeks ago,After a few weeks I can't really remember what it was exactly about. It was interested at the time but I didn't love it. I was just ok.
4,SPOOKY,"I am a big fan of Kay Hooper, so I was very excited when I foundWhisper of Evil at the bookstore. Suffice to say, it was hard toto put this book down. Nell and Matt are a wonderful couple towatch. My only complaint is that I wish their relationship hadbeen more center stage than it was. Keep them coming, Kay!"
4,Whisper of Evil by Kay Hooper,This is the second of three in a trilogy and the best of the three. Where the third gets too bogged down with trying to descibe how psychic ability works this one follows a good plot line to a final surprise outcome. I love Kay Hooper books and enjoy most of them. I definately recommend this one.
4,great author,I iked this book as well as all the others by this author. would recommend this to other readers that like this style of books
5,Loved it,Another great book by Key Hooper. I'm completely sucked into her unusual story lines. I love Bishop and the members of his team. She can't write them fast enough for me.
4,Best of the Evil series,"The ""Evil"" series are not my favorites among Hooper's Bishop/SCU novels // psychic romances, but this one has stayed with me long after I first read it (several years ago). The back-story here seems to give it much more depth and punch than the other EVIL stories and we feel the pain here much more acutely. It is well-formulated and quite surprising, as many of her better stories are."
3,Good enough,The toothpicks are just what they are advertised as. I just don't like the flavor very much. It is mint and I find there to be plenty of flavor. I just don't particularly like the mint flavor without some sweetness to it. I like the cinnamon ones much better.
4,My kids are happy,I followed the instructions for the second window- which came out pretty good. My only issue with this is that getting the bottom-most part of the tint to clear the window is a problem for me. I tucked an extra inch into the window frame and it still gets caught on something deeper in. It may just be my car (Chevy Malibu). As far as the tint- it's great to have the kids quiet on trips- at least quiet from 'sun in my eyes' complaints.
3,price is right,"This is not bad for the price, except that it tore easily which means that the plastic may have been made 20 years ago. Perhaps the one they sent me was in a warehouse for a few years or it froze and refroze and got the plastic brittle."
2,Not what I ordered,"I purchased this car tint for two reasons only -1. For privacy and reflection of sun's glare2. For its removable and reuseable featureHowever, I did not receive the reuseable tint. Based on reading the installation instructions, what I got was normal car tint, which is applied normal as any other car tint. So, I got the wrong item that I purchased.Can someone confirm that this tint is static-cling and actually reuseable and removable? This is certainly distasteful."
3,Almost a good fit,"Hole size was ordered properly, but I used this on a modern street tubeless motorcycle rim, and it took some (what I'd consider) excessive tightening to get it to seat fully. It does seem to be doing the job fine."
2,Buy the Single Artist Versions!!!,"The only reason I would recommend this video to anyone is if they want to know what all kind of sounds/licks can be played in country music. If you have any desire though to learn anything from these artists, please just spend the money and get their full thing version! With this you have 6 great artist, but they only show you maybe 2 licks each. One of them doesn't even show you anything! He is just playing on, and on, and on...never once does he talk to you about anything he is doing! I don't even think a beginner should buy this!!! I am very disappointed!"
1,Caught In A Trap,I do not own this book but i own many others and i have to disagree about Elvis being on drugs and imagining The Beatles at Graceland. I'm sorry but the Beatles was there i don't know where Ricky Stanley is coming from but it seems to me when you write a book on someone as Iconic as Elvis you better have your facts straight. I do not purchase books written by family members they have a way of stretching the truth.
2,no off switch for the remote,It a cool looking car but the remote doesnt have an off switch and the batteries ran out the same day. So thats no fun for my son.
2,Don't get the red cover version!,Was looking forward to getting a 'newer' version of the so-called extended cut (supposedly 102 minutes) but instead got the 'old' 2002 DVD-5 version instead. Video and audio are crummy as all get out. Was hoping this brown covered version is a newer pressing and possibly dual-layered. The red cover version I got is the exact US version running 96 minutes! The cover looks to have been sloppy-made by a kid on a computer...hopefully when buying this you make sure you don't get the red cover version. Don't get ripped off like I did. Hopefully someone will leave a review of the brown cover version (with booklet) and let us know if it's a good transfer or not. Cheers!
1,Fake version,I did not receive what it was described. The seller never responded and the DVD was just a cheap copy with no booklet package or anything. Do not buy it.
1,What Is This,"I'm sorry, but this cd is awful. Never have I been so disappointed with a cd purchase. I would much rather have a cd of Ted ranting than this garbage pawned off as Rock 'n Roll. The only redeeming track off Craveman was the instrumental Earthtones. The rest was mostly blaring neo-metal. A few lines of lyrics repeated incessently to stretch out the song. Even his words have gone bland, only a handfull of meaningful lyrics. You are Ted Nugent not Fred Durst. Once a pioneer and force-to-be-reckoned-with, now only a wanna be has been. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money on this. Go buy a Britany Speers album, at least you could look at it."
4,An Excellent Album!,"I'm not a big fan of Ted Nugent's output from the last 10 years, but I love this album. Sure, Ted Nugent can be overbearing and downright itrritating, but if you can set that aside and listen to the music, there's some real quality material here.""Craveman"" starts of with the blistering, vocal chord straining ""KLSTRPHNKY"" and never lets go. While Ted hasn't updated his lyrics, he has done a good job updating his sound. My favorite track has to be ""At Home There"". Great vocals, a trance sound mingled with guitar -- a great ""road"" song!While it seems that the vocals are set just a notch below the guitar work in terms of volume, it doesn't really affect my enjoyment of the album.If you can get through some of the contrived songtitles (""Pussywhipped"", ""Sexpot"", ""Cum N Gitya"", and ""My Baby Likes My Butter on Her Gritz"") and you're a fan of hard rock -- I think you'll enjoy this album."
4,motorcity madness!!!,"Well my rock and roll friends, uncle ted has done it again! The motorcity maniac has put out an excellent cd proving once again that the old guitar wizard has a lot of licks left before he goes to the big hunting ground in the sky. Its a bit more heavy sounding, but I think it is worth your time to give it a good listen. Over the years ted has had a couple of mediocre cd's, but has never let me down at one of his shows. Teds inventive guitar work is top notch ( he is still one of the loudest guys I have ever heard) and this is a great effort! Much success uncle ted and keep up the great work!"
3,This is an excellent reference of roller coasters,This book gives you a complete history and reference of roler coasters of America. The reference goes alphabetically by states. It even gives you Canada! I enjoyed this book because I am a roller coaster lover.
3,Could have been better.,"As a member of the American Coaster Enthusiasts, this was the first book I ever bought purely on roller coasters. It tells a fairly accurate history of the roller coaster and, state by state, lists the major coasters (at the time it was published) in the United States. I was disappointed that some of the smaller parks and their coasters were left out. But overall a fairly good book for the coaster enthusiast."
1,Horrible,I was very disappointed in this product. The craftsmanship was just bad. The lid was crooked (it was attached that way) - but I thought I could live with it. Then the handle fell off. The product was very dirty and oily. I expected better from a name like Bialetti and was really disappointed.
1,never freezes,"Bought this unit on sale at Target and now i know why. The first time i used the unit, we froze the canister for 8+ hours as per the instructions. Then we poured in the cold base and let it run for 30 minutes while waiting in keen anticipation. Nothing, only soup. you can imagine our disappointment. I figured that the base wasn't cold enough. The next time, i froze the canister for 48 hours AND made sure that my freezer was set to O Degrees. Again, never got past soup stage. Very disappointed in unit and will be getting a cuisenart."
1,"Won't freeze, but does cool","It won't make ice cream, but will cool the ice cream fluids down to make a cool drink. We put the freezing drum in our chest freezer over night as instructed. It was well chilled. We put the ingredients in the freezing chamber, turned the machine on and 30 minutes later the mixture had no solidity to it, but the ice cream ingredients were nice and chilled. We drank it like we would a very liquid smoothie.DON""T BUY THIS if YOU EXPECT TO ACTUALLY MAKE ICE CREAM. We've been making ice cream for 35 years with another machine so we know what to do."
3,Deni Ice Cream Maker,It's not what I expected. I had an older model of Deni Ice Cream maker and like that older one much better.
1,meh,I bought this ice cream maker because of the great reviews.. the first time it over froze which was me being impatient so I figured ill try again.. I poured the custard in and turned the machine on but my ice cream never even got to soft serve.. i have the bowl in the freezer which i keep mixing but i know its gonna have ice crystals in in.. I think I am going to go ahead and splurge on the ice cream maker that connects to my kitchen aide.So disappointed :(
1,"Less than One Star-Piece of crap, going back","Wow! We must be doing something terribly wrong. I am very disappointed to have purchased this for my daughter as a gift. It is a total piece of garbage. We have made two recipes - one sorbet, one cream-based -- both resulted in a soupy mess after more than 30 minutes of churning. Cuisinart, here we come."
1,wastes too much product,"I don't make traditional ice cream, I use it to make protein ice cream, it is an awesome way to treat yourself and be healthy at the same time.The plastic scraper doesn't touch the sides or bottom. I had to use a plastic spoon to supplement the scraping action. if I didn't do that all of the product freezes like a rock to the bottom and sides, leaving you with a watered down center. the sides and bottom eventually freeze up and it stops spinning. such a waste of space. Is there something that works out there?"
2,Not user friendly,I was not happy with the performance. Motor was not strong enough to push additives (mashed fruit) through the ice cream and it just stopped. Mixing paddle dragged along the bottom and stopped the motor. Couldn't just go away and leave the machine make ice cream.
4,TWO OF MY FAVORITES,"THIS IS A GREAT CD OF ANY FAN OF EITHER OF THESE ARTISTS. EDDIE ""CLEANHEAD"" VINSON IS A GREAT JAZZ/BLUES SINGER-SHOUTER, A PRETTY GOOD SAX PLAYER, AND CANNONBALL ADDERLY IS ONE OF THE BEST SAX PLAYERS EVER . THIS IS FUN MUSIC TO LISTEN TO, A GREAT RE-ISSUE. SOLID, TIGHT, BACKUP BY ADDERLY'S BAND, WHICH REALLY SWINGS."
2,TOO HARD!!!!!!!!!,This game is way too hard to be fun. Of all the final fantasy games this one is the worst. The PS1 version is a lot better and not has hard as finding this one. Which is long out of print.
2,CHEESY! C'MON!,"Augh! This game is so cheesy! 3 quarters of those other reviewers are 30-40 years old. Okay, let's face it, this game is kinda classic, but it's soooo not this generation. People who like RPGs should go new, to FF9, or 10. I'm sorry, this game is just...... out-dated.( : anonymous......"
5,Simply some of the best!,"one of the classics!don't play this version, play the revamped versions that are not nearly as annoying to level up in.This version will have you level up for weeks just to advance. This was fine 20 years ago, but not now!still, a classic!"
5,Is this really what I think it is?,"If this is what I think it is, than I'm surprised. This seems to be the Cartridge of the Nintendo game that came out in 1987 in Japan and 1990 in America. If it ever comes in stock, order it, frame it, and put it on your wall. This was the first Final Fantasy kiddies."
3,It is ok,i gave it 3 stars because....the graphics ok pretty good even if it was on nes.the gameplay was very long and quite hard.there are many things you need to do to beat the game.i like to own the first final fanatsy.umm if you are really into final fantasy email me at Macanicore@cs.com and say how much you will bye it for.title it ff bid
5,"For the time, a killer game","Short of the Dragon Warrior series, this is the only really good RPG on the NES. This game does differ from its sequels in that you pick the classes of characters you want to use, instead of having a set cast of chatacters, and you have the whole party for the whole game, instead of switching them in and out, gaining and losing allies as the story progresses. By today's standards, kind of old school, but worth playing."
4,Final Fantasy - A Legend in Gaming,"One of the best video games of all times. Having played some of the later ones, it was neat to see where the concepts had come from. While it took a little while to get used to the simpler gameplay, it was still that vintage Final Fantasy that I love so much. Great game."
2,"Warning: Electronic, not Symphonic","The music on this CD is electronically synthesized, not produced by traditional instruments. While this is not necessarily a horrible idea, it is apparent from the first moment of the first track and it did not suit our tastes."
3,Trouble Shooting Gasoline Marine Engines,"While this book would make an interesting text for an engineer, it is of little use to the average reader or backyard mechanic (Which the author readily admits...). The descriptions of all the critical operations of an engine are largely academic, and few readers would be able use this text to gain insight into their engine woes. Fewer still would be able to effect a repair based on a chapter's content. This is not the text to bring along for emergency repairs! It is well written, and can educate a reader who has the patience to sit through it. If you are bored and curious, you may find this new understanding fulfilling, yet not especially helpful."
4,Interesting outlook,"Even if you do not accept Swedenborg as a seer, his ideas on love are quite high minded and inspiring."
5,Great book. Wonderful preparation for critical challenges.,This book discusses the experiences of managers at different points in their first year as new first-line managers. I read the book half way through my first year as a manager and wished that I had read it sooner. My experiences were very similar even though I am in a completely different field. This was even more usedul than a three day new managers' workshop that I took.
5,"concise, applicable, real-life discussions","I've only read 1/2 of this book that was loaned to me, but I'm convinced enough to buy it myself and keep it as a reference book. I've only done this for a few others - all long-term, working examples, applicable to a variety of situations in real life - not theory!"
2,Perhaps there was a pony in the room?,"You know the story about the little who walks into a room full of poop and exclaims there must a pony in here somewhere... I am guessing there is some great information in this book somewhere among the tedious writing because it was highly recommended, but I could not get past the first several pages. It reads like an academic paper and it kept telling me what it was going to tell me."
5,An absolute must read!,"Anyone interested in management or professional development should read this book. I can't tell you how many times I wondered why steller sales people made such terrible managers. Other valuable topics such as working with your peers, managing your Manager and Leadership are also addressed.Even if you are already a Manager, this book is definately and eye opener."
2,Good - Only for sales and Financial Managers,"The book is well written but lacks in breadth of manager case studies. So much of the book is written toward financial institution managers that it has little applicability to managerial positions in manufacturing, engineering, or other disciplines that don't involve motivating people to meet their sales quotas."
5,Good Book!,"I have a grandson who is gay, my daughter recommended this book to me so I ordered it. The book is excellent, full of helpful advice and information on how to deal with this subject. It is a touchy issue in our family but something that I needed more help in dealing with. I intend to refer to it time & time again."
5,Guide for Caring Families,"This is a compassionate guide that will help parents, siblings and anyone else who knows someone who identifies as homosexual, or is wondering what to do about same sex attraction. It is easy to read and written as openly as an uncle talking to a nephew. I have known hundreds of people who identify as homosexual and I believe the theory this book is based on to be true. It is logical that boys need to identify with their dads and girls with their moms.If my parents had read this book when I was a teenager, I would have been contented and heterosexual instead of spending ten years as a lesbian feminist. This is a book of hope regardless of your religous beliefs; parents just have to be humble enough to see the part they have played in the problem, and be willing to change and be forgiven. Loving children both as they are and seeing their true potential, is what this wise book suggests."
4,Most Helpful Book for Parents with SSA Child,"Richard Cohen's book, ""Gay Children, Straight Parents"" is the most compassionate book written about what it's like to be parents of a child with a same sex attraction. His plan of action is simply he who loves longest wins. He has a concrete plan for loving children back into the family and for healing through never giving up on them. I would recommend this book to every parent who has a child with a same sex attraction. It helped me realize it's really not about sex. It's about a faulty attachment to the same sex parent for a variety of reasons."
1,Give me a break...,This fool was interviewed on the radio this morning. This book has no merit whatsoever.
1,Watch before purchasing,This guy has been rejected and expelled from many organizations in the US and is not certified or licensed. Watch the videos below before you buy.Part 1[...]Part 2[...]
1,Amazon should refuse to carry this book,"It is a shame that the ""Report Abuse"" button is only available for comments, and not for the book itself. This book is an insidious attempt to mislead those seeking help into purchasing hateful propaganda. If Mr. Cohen wants to spread his blatant ignorance in text, he should at least have the decency to label it appropriately.Amazon - Please take this book down until it at least is titled in such a way to mark it as an anti-gay work. No one looking for actual information on understanding and helping their LGBT child should be exposed to this drivel - it does real and demostrable harm, and is in no way on subject."
4,Other Tam Lin,"This is my second book from Ms Jones after the Howl's Moving Castle (a magical romantic story :). I think the main idea still maintained the romantic side and yet the main plot of wellknown Tam Lin was given a bit fresh twist.In here, the man in trouble was called Thomas Lynn and the heroine was Polly. It was said the relationship between them took 4 years to grow and that certainly gives the intensity of it. After the 4th year, something bad happened and Polly found herself forgetting all about Thomas. Fortunately, a book brought her memory bits by bits though it was not intended to. From here the wild chase started.The fairy world was represented in the family Thomas Lyn related to, which kept reminding me of the mafia (only-family meetings, big crowds).There was a bit confusing twist happened in the end of the story which why I gave only 4 stars. The end was not a bad one, original one I should say, but you have to pay extra attention to the words."
3,Fascinating but Flawed,"The first 90% of the book was very well done and mixed reality and fantasy in an intriguing way.The murky ""end of the story"", however, was difficult to understand, leaving the reader wondering what had actually taken place, what the ending meant, and which (if any) of the numerous subplots had been concluded."
3,Not the Best,"The book was certainly not Diana Wynne Jones' best work. I admit it was hard to follow and the ending seemed incomplete and poorly described. It seemed like a good plot, but it slowly digressed into a confusing mass of big words and weird age differences. My suggestion is save the seven bucks for coffee or if you're a die-hard Diana Wynne Jones fan, go to the library and check it out."
5,Students love it!,"This most recent 4th edition of Essentials is excellent. Dr. Feldman is a wonderful writer with a conversational style and yet all of the information needed in an overview text is here. There are study guides built into the text and many student and professor ""aids"". My students learn a lot and enjoy this book."
5,Replete with biographical information,"The Ambient Century: From Mahler To Trance - The Evolution Of Sound In The Electronic Age is a significant and seminal contribution to music history. Mark Prendergast has compiled a comprehensive group of artists to reflect and represent more than one hundred years of change, evolution (and at times revolution) as electronic invention impacts upon the creation, production, and performance of music. Replete with biographical information, as well as each individual artist's effect on ambient and electronic music, The Ambient Century is an amazing work of research and scholarship that is so well written as to be entirely accessible to the non-specialist general reader with an interest in the subject. No personal, academic or community library music history collection would be complete without the inclusion of Mark Prendergast's The Ambient Century as a core reference title."
3,A very detailed account of one man's taste,"Looking for an objective guide to ambient music?Well, don't buy this book. It's a hell of a history lesson, an entertaining read (for music dorks like myself) and features some pretty comprehensive recommendation lists if you don't know where to start on an artist (particularly useful for starting with classical recordings) but it certainly isn't the guide it makes itself out to be. I enjoyed it, I read every word.I can recommend it to anyone looking to see how music developed from the 19th century to today, but I can't recommend it as a serious guide to...well, anything. This isn't serious. This is subjectivity, taste and history. Scholars look elsewhere."
3,Encyclopedic array of info; needs another editing,"For sheer volume of information about Minimalism, Ambient, and the key 20th-century composers and performers thereof, this book is invaluable. Almost every experimental composer I could think of had an in-depth listing in here. If you have any interest at all in this kind of music--a broad genre including Satie, Debussey, Cage, Riley, Carlos, Oldfield, Orbital, Chemical Brothers, Air, Miles Davis...and on--I highly recommend checking this book out.That said, there are faults with this book. One reviewer has already pointed out factual errors--I've found one too: John Cage was a professor at Wesleyan University in the '60s and '70s (I don't know the dates off the top of my head), and not, as Pendergrast states, at the University of Connecticut. There are also numerous typos and grammatical errors, all of which suggest that this book could use a copy editor and a couple of fact checkers. Let us hope for future editions."
2,Very Light,"This is much more of a ""who I think is cool"" book than one with any information or analysis. Good for those who want to name-drop, but not for real students of music."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.,"As I read this book it took me only a few pages before I began to first grow frustrated and then grow angry. All this book really amounts to is a ""how to"" book without the ""how to"". The author often goes into vague, one-paragraph descriptions of a direction you may take in accomplishing the task at hand with no detail beyond saying that this may be a way and it MIGHT cause an investigation with no effort to tell of a better way or what to do if you arouse suspicion. At best the author seems to be no authority on the topic whatsoever and only someone who watches a lot of tv and does a little bit of ""vague"" research. I would recommend this book only for the severely uninformed or maybe the naive person for a cheap thrill."
3,"Not Bad, but a little out-dated","Good ideas and a good base to start, but the author tells you in the book to research as laws and techniques are always changing. some interesting anecdotes and good ideas."
2,Wheres the Beef?,"I bought this book hoping for some good, current information. All this book does is provide information most people all ready know. The price is good, but there are much better books around concerning this subject. If you really want to know how to get a new identity dont waste your money, find another book!! This book doesnt do it!!"
2,hm... surely not so good.,"I didn't buy this book here, but I have read it.It's good for fun reading, but I strongly recomend you not to take this seriosly. The author just doesn't know much about the subject he's writing. Using a ""dead infant"" strategy is way off for two reasons - 1 - now more and more states are making crosslinks between their birth and death certificates - 2 - you never know who else has assumed the identity of that infant, do you want to share it with a serial killer?The only working strategy today is finding dead parents and filling for a ""delaid birth record"" assuming to be their unregistred child ( lots of people are not registred propersly and don't have a BC, mostly due to some religios believes )."
5,Why can't the world have more books like this one?,"Dear Amazon:I bought and read the book ""The Modern Identity Changer,"" which you offer for sale. Not only did it live up to its title, providing invaluable tips on changing one's identity, but Sheldon Charrett also wrote quite eloquently about the trend of disintegrating privacy in our country. I was literally moved by the book. I do not usually write letters of accolade or make recommendations, but this book's quality compels me to do so. I'm surprised Simon & Schuster hasn't signed this guy yet! We could certainly use more refreshing views like this one in our mainstream literature.Kudos to Amazon.com for carrying this book!J. C. McCallister, Esq. Los Angeles"
5,Stunning,"It's unusual that a band that only has two studio albums should have as many live albums, but Transatlantic isn't your normal band, and since they're probably never going to be playing together again, I'll buy anything they release. For those of you who have Live in America from a couple of years ago, this is not the same live experience. Live in Europe presents you with a band that has ""gelled"" a lot better and is performing the tunes with a lot more ease. Just listen to ""Stranger in Your Soul"" once through on this album and you'll hear that this was a magical night in the band's short history. The things that ruined Live in America for me (mostly sloppiness) are more than made up for on this disc. Buy it if you've been following Transatlantic. Buy it if you haven't. It's really good prog."
3,Good for those with patience,"I bought this book looking for tips on my pinochle game. I did not realize until the book arrived that it is 99% geared towards double-deck. I'm a single deck player so that sort of put a crimp in the book's usefulness for me.The author really seemed like he knew what he was talking about and as you can see the other reviewers thought so too. However, the book goes through many hands of pinochle and if you have the patience, time and concentration to go through every trick in the examples then more power to you! Personally I got a lot more out of ""Pinochle is the Name of the Game"" by Walter Gibson and the US Playing Card Co."
2,Not for the novice.,"I'm a newcomer to Pinochle (but not to card games) and found the book difficult to read. It is full of jargon without any explanation of the jargon. Yes, there is a glossary, but it leaves out many of the jargon. For example, in the bidding section, the author refers constantly to ""throwing a meld"" without explaining the phrase.Another problem of the book is that the author never really explains what rule set he is assuming. Also he refers to the ""Internet"" rules without telling us which sites he is playing and what rules are implemented there.If you are a beginner of the game, I think you'll be befuddled by the book. It looks like the book is aimed at the experienced/expert players who are familiar with the jargon."
5,Yummy,"I think this is the best microwave mac n cheese around. There is enough in one bowl for lunch. The only downside is you need to stir it a lot after it is done so everything is mixed. Occasionally, there is a stray noodle that is hard with a lot of mix still on it, but I like those and I make it a game to find one."
5,love the triple cheese,now out of all the bowl treats this one is my favorite and worth 5 star rating plus it was shipped fast..love it
2,Yuck.,"I don't mind most quick microwave meals. Aside from the price (I feel that it is affordable) this meal is terrible. It starts off as a bowl with powder flavoring and hard noodles. You peel back the lid and add hot water to the powder and hard noodles. After stirring the product, you are suppose to microwave it for 5 minutes.Easy peasy and perfect for busy working moms.The problem was with the flavor ""powder"". It is a birck. No amount of stirring, stabbing or soaking loosens it and so it turned into a chewy salty mass of gross. I will stick with my cup of noodles instead.What a shame."
3,Tastes good but...,These taste very good and are quick and easy. The only disappointment is the fact that there is trans fat in them. I figured in this day and age that would be pretty much a no go but I guess Betty Crocker hasn't gotten a clue yet.
5,Very thought provoking.,"An excellent book. I couldn't put it down. The story line was interesting and informative. I had no idea that there was such a dark side to Dionysis. But everything man-driven or created has both a dark and light side. Good/God is more powerful than evil/devil. Devil/Evil hates God/good. We all have our demons.I thought the book wrapped up rather quickly toward the end having spent such in depth work building, but that's my only criticism."
2,Eww!,"I received this book as a gift and couldn't wait to read it.I thought it would be an exploration of mental illness and the terrible toll it takes on the human soul. I thought it would explore the historical conditions and supersitions that people with mental illness had to live under. I thought it would end with Christ triumphally healing the man who lived among the graves in the Bible.It was none of those things.But I found it very upsetting and somewhat sickening. For a Christian book, it focuses an awful lot on human sacrifice and very dark things. I have never read a bleaker novel in my whole life. I felt depressed and hopeless at the end, instead of knowlegable and uplifted.I understand how horrible mental illness was back then and how horrible human sacrifice always is. What I don't understand is why this book focused on the dreadful oppression without offering any hope for a better future."
4,For someone else,I ordered this book at the request of someone else. I did not hear yet whether this book has been helpful or not
1,Horible,"This was the biggest piece of crap I have ever read. Unlike the people who wrote this book or the people who gave it good reveiws, I actully remember being a teenager. What I found even more disturbing was the sutle racism in this book. The auther said things like ""good middle class children come home acting like gansters because thats who there peers are"" I don't know about anyone else out there but the authers obviosly refering to black people. I personally won't take anymore of these steriotypes by rich middle aged white people with some phd in child phycology."
3,Dealing with Defiant Teen.,"I sent this book to my sister, and she found some of it helpful, but not all because of the unique situation she has with her teen. She has gotten a bit saturated with advice, which is not always so helpful."
5,Excellent book,"This book was easy to read and understand, very interesting, and - most important - gave highly practical and easy-to-follow advice for any parent dealing with a difficult child or teen."
4,Good for parents,"The book is a little simplistic for the sophisticated psycholgical reader, but excellent for a parent who is dealing with a child who is oppositionhal and defiant and has reached his or her limit.Tellall"
4,Right on the mark,"This book has not only helped to understand a grandchild, it has also given some inspiration to a relative with an uncontrolable daughter. When you run our of ideas, buy this book."
3,The defiant child,This seemed to be a repeat of other books I have read in the past. Not the best info out there
5,Makes me a better parent!,"With the guidenss of ""The Defiant Child"" I have learned skills that help me get my 9 year old daughter to be respectful!"
5,odd,"This Book is set up simply, and very detailed...with many examples of both what to expect of behavior from children diagnosed with ODD and how to handle different scenarios. Thank You so very much."
3,Not bad for parents of teens!,"One comment I haven't heard yet about this book that may be useful to many parents is that the author frequently references experiences with teens and too often no mention is made of younger children. I think his ideas are wonderful for teens, but if you need help with a younger child--look elsewhere!"
5,Mothra Plush Toy - Godzilla's Foe,"Mothra is adorable, I have wanted a Mothra stuffed animal for a long time. The seller bent over backwards to fill my order; they searched through their entire warehouse and finally found a Mothra for me for which I cannot thank them enough. So I would definitely order from them again. They care about their customers. I would give them a 5 star rating. Thank you, Sincerely, April L. Franklin."
5,Mothra Plush,"Great toy, the kids love it! good detail, very well made, and very true to the movies. Highly recommended."
1,Very disapointing,"I have many other of the Toy Vault Godzilla plushes, the large ones, and compared to them, this one is crap. First of all, it is almost not a plush at all only the antenna are plush. The rest of the figure is a clothy, almost vinyl material. Further, don't let the 14"" in the description fool you, this thing is practically tiny compared to the other large Toy Vault plushes. I would be disappointed with this for any price, but for the current high price, it is a joke."
2,Disappointed with the plot but not with Simon Baker.,I bought this DVD only because of Simon Baker. But I didn't like the person he portrayed. It must have been good acting for me ever not to like him. Well done again.
3,The Lodger (2009),"I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock's work, so I was happy to see there was a remake of this movie. Although I enjoy the old original Black & White movie, I found this updated color version quite good. I was mystified as to who the killer was until the very end. I didn't see this one coming. The help of a good cast, directing, sets, and music (reminded me of previous Hitchcock themes) made it all come together in a well rounded mystery. Good quality DVD with a few extras and decent replayability. If you enjoyed this, catchThe Bedroom WindowandBody Double (Widescreen Special Edition)which are reminescent of Hitchcocks style.CA Luster"
3,Some Reservations,"The classic novel inspired by the Ripper murders gets an update and a change of venue. The focus alternates between intriguing scenes between Simon Baker in the title role and Hope Davis, and standard cop fare with a miscast Alfred Molina as a Hollywood cop teamed with his callow partner. They're working the Ripper angle of a spat of Hollywood killings and note such ""little known"" lore about the original crimes as the fact that Jack The Ripper was never caught. Um...okay. The picture's really well shot, but there are some pretentious touches of classical music playing during the murders. The final scenes though are suspenseful and at least you don't see the resolution coming from a mile off. I just wish the picture had focused more on the Davis-Baker relationship, as the two stars are quite good."
4,Good flick!,"I love finding good obscure movies and this one is definitely a good one. The acting is convincing and everyone is suspect. I bought this after reading Amazon reviews and bearing in mind that some people find fault with everything. The plot has been aptly described in previous reviews, and I will admit that I am not familiar with anyone in the cast. I consider this film ""a keeper"""
3,Dread Central review!,"As I was watching, I enjoyed it, but the more distance I get from it, the less memorable it becomes. At one point Malcolm tells Ellen, ""I'm not particular ... about food."" If you're not too particular either, then it could be just the light taste of Ripper mayhem that you've been craving since being sucked in by the disappointingly unsatisfying From Hell and other similar fare. Otherwise, you may want to give it a pass.[...]"
4,Will delight,"This is earnest, experimental but unaffected noise pop. Lo-fi genius. This album has some old ones, some new ones, and some new versions of old ones. Phil Elvrum's boyishly sweet voice and the spontaneous feel of these tracks makes it sound like a recording of a kid fooling around and banging things in the band hall. Songs by The Microphones often sound like experiments in sound, with an innocent, Modest-Mouse-style voice singing pop melodies to smooth it out."
2,Does NOT deserver its reputation,"I don't know why this book has so much popularity so far. It isNOT conscise, it is NOT well typesetted and the overall style is very confusing! I would recommend another book Convex Optimization by Boyd"
3,Sensationalized but true,"This book by a former Jesuit priest/psychoanalyst was published first in France in 1956. If it had been immediately translated into English and other languages instead of in 1965 and widely circulated (and paid attention to and acted upon responsibly) among Roman Catholic bishops, priests, and laity in the United States and elsewhere, we might have been able to lessen the number of those abused and damaged by priests and other religious personnel during the subsequent fifty years. Though Jury has a frank and often sensationalistic style, he uncovered and exposed a pathology within the Catholic church that he attributes especially to the celibate life required of those seeking to serve others as religious priests, brothers, monks and nuns. It is a scathing indictment that warrants continued vigilance and demands for change in a way of life that he deems neurotic at its core."
3,where is it ?,I would love to have these to review .. or even to use ... I ordered these several weeks ago and still don't have them ... and no word on why or why not ......
4,Too wide...,"The boots look great, but the calf section is too wide. They are made for jeans that go in the boot, i guess. I needed boots that fit snug to wear with skirts, so i had to return them. Overall i like Nine West and these boots are of high quality i usually expect from them."
3,"Not really what I was looking for, but interesting","This is a well written book that deals with 12 of the well known artist at this museum. Interesting opinions, not fully expounded on, only 1 or 2 works of each artist, mostly dealt with paintings and the history of the evolution of art (again, mostly painting) during this particular time period , about 1850 to 1920. Great time line in the back that covers political, artistic and social events.No map of where the permanent exhibitions are - what I really wanted."
3,Xenakis,"I received the book but it took almost three weeks. I ordered from eight other vendors, all others orders were received within 6 days. I would hestitate to use this vendor because of the time it takes to ship."
4,Tracing Back Chinese History Through Food,A very interesting and entertaining book tracing back Chinese history through food. It does not only show you the information about the subject but also picture us the way Chinese people ate in the old days. My favorite part is about food in Han dynasty when the author vividly described the way Han people preparing their food through the Han Dynasty carved stone plaques.
5,Great Product:,The Stick is the perfect tool for massaging sore muscles. I bought it for my calves but have started to use it for all muscle groups. The shorter version works great for all but middle back. Great Product
4,Great buy,A very good buy for athletes all around. The stucks helps with sore muscles and muscle recovery. It allows athletes to find comfort in you own personal massage therapist
4,great stick,This item is great. Its a great massager for many areas of body and was very helpful in recovery from minorbcalf muscle tear.
4,Tight Muscles? Buy this,"Bought this on a recommendation from friend.overpriced, but does the job.helps in recovery and warmups.had tight calves and since using this, its relieved those symptoms and reoccurring calf pulls.highly recommend this product."
1,"The loud, annoying roots of the series","It's been said that everyone has to start somewhere, but man, what a stinker of a starting point! The prerequisites of all that is Mega Man are present; the multi-tiered platform stages, those wacky bosses, the ""rock-paper-scissors"" weapon mentality, and it all would've been great if it wasn't made with 1986 NES technology. Many of the major sins present include slow and choppy scrolling, uninspired level art, repetitive level design, and Mega Man climbing a ladder way too slow and dropping like a rock when falling from a great height. It could've been more, much MUCH more, and looking back after being spoiled on the later games it's hard to consider this the genius it was meant to be."
3,In my opinion this book was corney.,"The book Nightmare Hall, by Diane Hoh, to me was intresting the first time I read it but the second time it became kinda drab. In a way I liked it because it was very captivating and easy to read and understand. Sometimes it was too easy to read or the actions that the author said happened would never happen."
3,"Okay Kit, but nothing special...","The kit came complete for use, but a couple of features didn't impress me. First, when installing the bulb, it's rather difficult to connect the ground lead - not enough wire slack. Second, when I went to attach the light housing to the bracket, I had to tap each bolt hole...and this is rather difficult to do. It wouldn't have been too costly to already provide tapped holes. Overall the install went well and worked the first time."
4,Much better than I expected,"With the so-so cover art and Jerry Springer as one of the stars, I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised! Great acting, good production and king of scary, when you consider the movie's premise. Overall, not an academy-award winner, but a great evening's entertainment. Armand Assante gives a good performance."
1,Very BAD movie,this movie goes really slow. Not what we thought it was supposed to be. A reality show is much better. Did not expect a lot from this movie but it was a total waste of monies!! Don't bother to buy or rent. Not worth it.
4,Height chart,"I had been looking for a height chart with pictures on it. It took me a while to find, but I found it on Amazon. It is well constructed with picture windows and the frame made of wood. If you don't mind mounting it to the wall, this is perfect for you."
1,This is not related to the movie Grudge,"incredibly boring and poorly written book. full of mistakes including characters calling each other another name, etc. don't waste your money. let's hope this woman is a better lawyer than she is a writer."
3,review from a die hard gnr fan!,"The music is a 5 out of 5 but the selection is a 3 at best. Not bad if you don't mind the fact that two of guns n roses better albums are completely left out. If you want a gnr greatest hits album the ""live era"" discs would be a better bet."
3,Eh.,"I don't like this game much. I suppose it's worth $4, but it's definitely not phenomenal. Like Ninja Gaiden, only significantly less fun. Also, the ninja is purple for some reason...You'd be better off getting a more fun NES game such as Xevious or Ice Climbers or something for $4."
1,ninjas that don't rock,"ninjas always rock. it's a scientific fact. this game is not science. i bought this game knowing full well how bad it was. it was a novelty purchase. some games are so terrible they become quite entertaining. from the campy dialogue, to the unclear objectives, and to the run, jump, shoot ninja stars mechanic, this game is bad. where is the kitana sword? not here. the story line is......who cares. ninjas should do awesome flips and throught punching, and slice through enemies with a sword. should one purchase this game? no. unless you are like me and like to watch trainwrecks."
4,A vivid and perceptive evocation of an age,"Marsh clearly has his saints and his villains, but anyone with a scintilla of compassion who lived through the age would be hard-pressed to disagree with his judgments. He brings his subjects to life and dissects their Christianity (or their perversion of it). When you finish the book you will be all the happier for the vindication of Fannie Lou Hamer and all the more repulsed by the enduring power of cowardly and hypocritical clergymen.One cavil: For a book published by a school as distinguished as Princeton University, it has an alarming number of typographical errors."
2,A College Student's review,"God's Long Summer covers a very exciting and troubled time in American History. The various points of view Marsh used to complete this book is the key to understanding this time period. However, the unnecessary abundance of religious references and the slow pace of the book make it almost unreadable. It is heartbreaking to read through one uninteresting point of view, to discover the next chapter is just as dull."
4,+ 1/2 stars...Excellent Overview of Reed's Vee-Jay Material,"Jimmy Reeds loping shuffle blues style is among the most recognizable and this late-nineties collection of his recordings for Vee-Jay from 1953 to 1963 captures many of his highlights, including his two biggest hits that placed on the pop charts: 1957's ""Honest I Do"" and 1960's ""Baby What You Want Me To Do.""While much of this material is duplicated on Rhino's 2000 release THE VERY BEST OF JIMMY REED, there are a handful of tracks from LOST IN THE SHUFFLE that make it worth seeking out, including ""Aw Shucks Hush Your Mouth,"" ""The Sun Is Shining,"" ""Cold and Lonesome"" and ""Mary, Mary.""Reed was an influential singer, guitarist, harmonica player and songwriter. In 1991 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,Rare 1975 Folk/Rock Classic,"This CD was orignally an independent release (NY) in 1975. Gear Fab has reissued it with the permission of the original band. There are 2 new tracks on the CD that were not on the original LP. The LP has been a collector's item in the US and Europe for years since only 500 copies were made. It has been bootlegged in Italy and England. This CD is the only authorized version available. You can hear the band's influences, which include The Strawbs, Ralph McTell, and early Genesis. The sound is a progressive folk/rock, with acoustic and electric 6/12 string guitars with vocals and backup keyboard support. The new mix from Gear Fab brings out the classic bass and drums which were subdued on the original LP. If you like music and lyrics that make you think, you will enjoy Nosy Parker."
1,A Fan From The United Kingdom,"I found it to be subtly obtuse, with implications of non-textured verboseness and manifestations of diphenylhydantoin. Consequently, mildly perquisite ostentatiousness overwhelms tympanic membrane."
2,Not really vastu,"It seems whenever a sacred science like yoga or vastu comes to the West it ends up getting twisted and watered down. The presentation in this book of Vastu is no different. Vastu is not primarily about furniture placement as this book is. Vastu is about the flow of energy through, in, and around a structure. Just as Feng Shui has largely been comicized into furniture placement so has Vastu.I suppose if you are into yoga and want to feel like you are having a positive effect on your living space then go ahead and apply some of the principles of this book. Just keep in mind what you will learn is not really vastu.If you want to get into the subtle interactions of energy and structures then you should start hereBuilding with the Breath of Life: Working with Chi Energy in Our Homes and Communities. In that book you will really get an insight into the principles of sacred architecture and design."
2,it was not the sort of book for me,mmm as a creative I found the way I learn is a combination of visualizing and practical tips .. way to wordy and intellectualized for me
4,Hoora! it's a killertrip,"If you like Chris Cornells voice and Soundgardens music, this migth be the answer to your prayer about a follow up without the musicians from rage against the machine (although Audioslave rock too). The band wanted the producer to get close to the former Sondgardensound. And in my opinion he succeded. Creds. All 11 tracks are strong. Hard to tell wich one is best, and yet they are all quiet diffrent, just like they would have been with Soundgarden. If any other group have inspired them i would have to say Led Zeppelin.. and is that wrong? Don't think so! So give this swedish group a chance. You won't regret it. At Least i didn't!"
3,pretty good,I like this band. I wish they would tour the states again soon!I like the track Hammerhead best
2,Missing some greats...,Right off the bat...No Safety Dance number or the Regionals version of Don't Stop Believe. Those two missing alone would keep my from buying this.
1,TERRIBLE SHOW!,"I can't believe anyone likes this show or would buy this DVD! The show is terrible! Singing in hallways? Singing on football fields? Singing in coffee shops? Singing at the Dentist? No thanks, not my thing. If you want to watch a musical, that's fine, go see one on broadway or rent an old movie. Please do not pollute our public airways with this musical nonsense though. Plus these kids are terrible role models for our children. Don't even get me started on Kurt and his reprehensible actions, or the pregnant teen for that matter. Those two deserve all the slushies. The only thing good about this show is that it shows us all how NOT to act and what NOT to do. As if a season release of this show wasn't terrible enough, now we have to sit through this 2 hours long disc? NO THANKS!!! This a terrible show and a terrible product."
3,"Definitely not bad, but missing some really important numbers","This DVD has a great selection of songs from season 1, but it has a few oddballs and a few blaringly missing songs. We don't really need Fire or Alone (though I do love Alone - but the extended version that was released for CD/iTunes, not this teeny little clip), On My Own, Say a Little Prayer, etc. I realize many love those songs, but if it comes to including them, or deleting them in favor of a few more important numbers, I say get rid of them. Don't Stop Believin' regionals version, Over the Rainbow, My Life Would Suck Without You, I Dreamed a Dream, Halo/Walkin' on Sunshine, Keep Holding On, etc - those should all be here, and they're not. I would like to see a second volume from season 1 with more stuff."
2,This Glee fan is very disappointed!,"I am a self-professed Gleek. I have all the cd's and dvd's that they have released, so when I saw this one, I knew I had to have it. I wish I had saved my money! Watching just the dance numbers is no fun at all and then they aren't even the complete performances! You're better off just buying the different seasons as they come out and watch them that way. They don't include some of the better dance sequences like ""Jump"" and the Halo/Walking on Sunshine mash up. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't spend the money on this disc."
3,They left out the best song!,I was really disappointed to find they left off Colfer's singing of A House is Not a Home even tho' it's on the list. All there is is a piece of the song sung by Chenowith. That song sung by Colfer is my favorite of the first season. We got gypped !
4,meh,It is what it says- performances strung together nonstop. Some ability to chose which you wanted to watch would be nice.
4,Gleeky,"I love that this has many of the songs we enjoy. But I hate that so many songs are not on here. How did they pick & choose? I dunno.I thought this was going to be perfect for my 7yr old because there would be no inappropriate content, but to my surprise ""Like a Virgin"" is one of the songs LOL So we have to skip that one but all the others are great. We love it! And it looks great in bluray.The main menu is a bit annoying. I expected it to be easier to get to the song you wanted, but you fist have to go to the Episode, only then will it show you the songs. Maybe it's just my bluray player?"
2,I wish I had read the reviews first...,"I had high hopes for this disc. I had hoped that they would've released a disc that would have a complete or extended performance of each musical number. I had hoped it would be all music videos, but I guess they don't make music videos anymore. Instead, they give you rehashed performances taken straight from the TV show, with no added production or introduction of the song. In fact, in one of the numbers, part of the credits shown during the TV show, appears; they couldn't even edit that out? Rent it."
2,Great if you don't already own the DVD's...,"This is a great option for those who don't already own the Glee DVD's. I'd buy it if I hadn't Gleeked out and purchased the Season 1 DVD's and Season 2, Part 1 DVD's already. For those who *do* own the DVDs, just check out the extras' section. There's something called a ""Glee Jukebox"" that basically replays the musical numbers again! :)"
2,not what hoped for,they didn't have as many videos as I was hoping for. left too many of the really good ones out.
4,A lot for that price,"I have one of these and I think it is a good tool for that price. Although it is made in China, it is not like those multitools you often see as promotional items or at discount stores. The pliers are very strong, The Phillip screwdriver is a very good one(unlike those from the other chinese multitools), The flat screwdrivers, the bottle opener, and the file are well made and strong. The only thing I do not like very much is the blade. Although it is by far better than those from other chinese multitools, it is not as good as, say, a genuine swiss army knife blade. Overall, this tool is a good value bargain at that price."
5,FORWARD HO!!!!,"This is one serial that has it all...lost treasure, lost Indian tribe, lost ghost town!!! Jackie Cooper leads his troop in defeating gangsters bent on securing untold-of wealth! Great chapter endings...over the falls, collasping suspension bridge, mangled by stampeding hordes, etc...Family frendly adventure romp & a fun serial to boot!Sometimes the Universial serials get overlooked for being too plot-driven as opposed to the action-packed slick Republic product or the simplistic/cartoonish Columbia product...but, I will say that Scouts To The Rescue delivers on all cylinders!!!Just enough plot...enough humor...enough thrills to keep fans coming back week after week.A highly enjoyable viewing experience...Enjoy!!!"
2,"OK as an introduction, not much use otherwise.","The content is somewhat dated, so of limited use to anyone seeking detailed information. The author struggles to explain concepts in parts, suggesting that he has been less than meticulous in his research. There are better books available."
5,nice book,"This book is nice done, good explications for the person that is mechanicaly inlclined.I recomend this book to anyone that loves motorcycles.This is a book writen from a bike lover fot bike lovers.has the old stuff and the new stuff, and explains the delicate FI details and concepts.Marcos Pegueromotoseteo@gmail.com"
3,Not for the beginner,"This book does not get into enough detail for someone who wants to learn about fuel injection from scratch. Terms are constantly introduced like you are supposed to know what they mean and if the author tries to explain it, the descriptions are more a matter of fact instead of something that needs be explained in detail. The pictures in the books are mostly of parts. What I needed are diagrams to explain what is actually going on. While the author explained a process, I was unable to ""picture"" what was going on."
4,Helps take the mystery out of fuel injection,"I like this book, yet I'm a motorcycle fanatic and an electronic engineer. It's takes some effort to get to the core of EFI, which is the volumetric efficiency table. It explains speed-density EFI control, alpha-n EFI control, and mass air flow EFI control. The book discusses the trade offs between the three in regards to motorcycle applications. You won't get that in a automotive EFI book."
3,Pretty good...a bit dated in 2012,"A pretty good book that explains a great deal about FI bikes...written in 2004 though and so only touches on the latest systems...especially good for mechs who don't really know the princliples of FI, component function or the terms...you can't really use this book to tune or improve your bike, but it will definitely advance most mech's knowledge and comfort working around FI systems or when considering options for mods...maybe deserves 3 1/2 stars"
5,Wonderful Songs of the Bad Life,"This CD is a wonderful addition to anyones collection of Mafia related items. The songs are sung with an emotion that as one reviewer says comes right from the heart. The true value of these songs comes from the cultural and historical background that gave birth to them. A nice bottle of wine and a traditional meal round off the listeners enjoyment to this CD. I would suggest the Second CD in this series as well: Vol 2, Omerta, Onuri E Sangu, By ""La Musica Della Mafia"""
5,Italians only can really appreciate,First of all why would u think of purchasing this unless u speak or understand Sicilian???? Im not looking to buy a C.D in Japanese just because im into Karate... So if U Dont understand the sicilian language... or have relatives that u can relate this Fantastic music with.. Dont Buy it and u wont have to leave bad ratings for the rest of us.. FOUGEDDABOUDIT!!!Anyway For us Italian Americans this C.D is awesome!!! No fugazi here! So sit back Roll a fork full Of spagetti!! Pour a glass of Chianti and enjoy...
2,Background purchase,"This Cd is hardly overwhelming -- I can't imagine why people feel compelled to give 5 stars.It is beautiful music. However I don't listen to this CD nearly enough to consider giving it more than 2 stars. Buena Vista Social Club gone Italy this is not. Even if you love the Sopranos, you're probably not likely to go ape mad over this CD.It's a nice CD to have in your collection, but I fear it's going to gather more dust than airtime on my player."
5,Excellent introduction to a misunderstood and maligned group,"This is a very informative and interesting overview of Opus Dei by the journalist who coauthored ""Crossing the Threshold of Hope"". The author is perceptive and unbiased and writes well of an organization that has been unjustly maligned as a dark, secretive, quasi religious order dedicated to the advancement of theoracy or fascism or something - a number of charges are made against Opus Dei. Messori presents the essential spiritual simplicity of ""the Work"" and shows convincingly that it is precisely this simple, spiritual nature that condemns it to attacks from a secular world.I cannot think of a better introduction to Opus Dei."
2,A bit too much,"Strangely, as a deep and abiding fan of Opus Dei, I found this book just far too sacarine and cheerleading. The merits of the book lie in its understanding of the simplicity of the lay aposolate in Opus Dei which can bring about wondrous spiritual fruits, difficult to measure and difficult to quantify. But this seemed to just overdo its admiration for Opus Dei so much that it lacked a certain substance as to thing things that he really finds dynamic in ""the Work."""
2,Not Pleased,"This item was returned. The packaging was subpar, the case it came in was lightly damaged and the watch itself did not seem securely packaged inside. I got the impression I was sent a watch that had been previously returned."
1,stunning on picture - awful in reality,"Condition after unpacking:1. big stain inside, probably from previous wash or something;2. all metal parts are uneven in color, cheaply asymmetrically made, and inaccurately attached;In first 15 minutes after unpacking the metal base fell off. I tried to wash that stain away - no much luck, it seem burnt into the glass forever.I am very disappointed with this purchase: the decanter looked so pretty on a picture, but in reality it looks very cheap and it is useless now. Garbage."
2,"This is a ""Talking car compass""","This product's marketing is deceptive. Although it seemed to work fine, I was very disappointed when I received this product. The information states..""Great for the blind""...Huh? When I received it, It was much larger than expected and permanently mounted on a stand for a car, and the box clearly stated it was a car compass. How many blind people can drive cars? I purchased this as a gift for a blind person who likes to take short walks and thought it would help them stay oriented. I was embarrassed to give the gift, but had no time to get another."
3,Image a little deceiving,The mirror itself is a wonderful mirror. From the looks of the picture it has a pink tint to it which is absolutely wrong. The mirror is brown. I was very disappointed in the color.
5,Great bathroom mirror!,"We purchased and installed this mirror because my wife wanted a hands free magnifying mirror that matched our dark bronze fixtures. I think it was offered in several finishes, but this one matched perfectly and I've seen models at local hardware stores selling for as much as $200 that didn't look any better. The swing arm is strong and holds the mirror steady in quite a few positions. It is long enough to reach past the sink top and yet folds flat back against the wall when not in use. The mirror itself is great quality and has very clear, distortion free viewing, even at the highest magnification. The reverse side has a standard mirror when you don't need to literally be albe to ""count the pores"" on your forehead! The best part is that you don't have to hold it (leaving both hands free, it stays still (important with the magnification side), and doesn't end up falling on the floor like counter models. No seven years of bad luck here!"
1,A tribute to Britney Spears? Give me a break...,"A tribute is being done for Britney? Why? Tributes are saved for icons, or those who have contributed to their craft in such a way that their effort helps others or enlightens the public. Britney is and/or has done neither. Her ""music"" is disposable, the worst kind of bubblegum pop. Given her apparent lack of common sense (""let's get married for 58 hours in Vegas!""; ""uh, Buddhism; is that like Kaballah?""), and her lack of talent (she doesn't play any instruments, write any of her songs, compose anything, arrange anything), she doesn't deserve anything more than money she's gotten from those who can't tell the difference between real music & wannabes. Leave the tribute albums for those truly deserve them..."
1,Seattle03,"Uh...now I'm confused. A tribute to Britney Spears? Why? Cause she's the highest paid stripper in the history of the world? One would assume her 15 minutes is finally over when a CD as low as this hits the markets. When the list of 'artist' isn't listed, buyer BEWARE!"
3,A scholars book,Although this book was written by Father Groeschel (a favorite of mine) I was disappointed. I am a common lay person and knowing that St. Augustine is so deep I was hoping that this would be a simple introduction. It was written for scholars studying Augustine's work.
2,"Description wrong, will be returning","the product description is copy-pasted from the more common variant and is wrong. these are hard plastic grips in the same shape as the common rubber overmold hoguesthe use of 'Nylon' in the title is the only clue to distinguish the variants, but i had never heard of the all nylon version and wasn't keeping an eye out for such things (and as they are all made of nylon it doesn't really register as a difference)final note; it seems to install this version you have to drift out the stock pin with a hammer. i didn't bother to try it, but it should be straightforward and reversible. also the edges are sharp and can slice you, they mention it in the instructions but i thought it worth emphasizing."
1,Zoombinis 3rd grade and Jump Start 4th grade,I would have thought that you would not have had to oversee a childs work. Every time a child needed/wanted to change subjects you have to change disk for them. My child hasn't even taken a second look at the series because it doesn't spark her interest. We got custody of this child this last summer and I wanted to give her a chance at catching up on education that she had missed over the last several years. These programs are of no value in doing that. The third grade disk is completely useless. I won't waste my time on trying to get educational instructional software without first seeing it in operation. I feel that I bought something that in no way lives up to the advertisement.Terry L. Pomatto
1,Africa Trail,This game was purchased for my younger daughter (11) who thoroughly enjoys travel games. She became bored within the first few days and hasn't played it since.
5,It's an amazing controller for the NES!!!,"The different options, slow, turbo...are a wonderful way of improving the play time. I'd buy it again without thinking about!!"
1,Broken,"Received this contoller in the mail yesterday and went to use it today and it did not work. The ""B"" button was malfunctioning and the stick itself was also broken. Piece of junk."
3,Nutmeg Essential Oil,"Hmmm. This does not smell at all like nutmeg, so in that respect it was disappointing. It does smell like cloves, however."
5,THREE CHEERS FOR DALE WATSON,"MR DALE WATSON what more can one say , or maybe one should say Mr todays country music , Dale is one of the very few to carry on traditional country music, the way it should be ,Old Roy and Ernest, Johnny and Waylon would be happy country music is in good hands. This album starts with Louie's Lees Liquor Lounge and goes through 12 twelve fabulous tracks to Roadtrain which coincidentaly dale wrote on one of his many trips to the great land of Australia, I think he has been to australia 7 or 8 times, we wish he would apply for residentilal status his trips don't come often enough.I await with abeited breath for every new release, by the man who should have every award nashville presents, but as it goes has zilch, now days i call it Music Pity USA . I say BUY IT"
5,Hard Nosed and Action Packed,Max McCoy is the best author yet for Indiana Jones. When I read one of his books I feel like I'm watching the movie. This book has a lot of action and a wonderful plot. I especially like the part in Edda's shaft. With the warriors and..... If you like Indiana Jones stories read this book to find out what happens!
2,Indiana Jones and the Hollow Earth,"The characters were shallow, the plot thin, and the action inconsistent with the plot. However, most of the Indiana Jones series are written as simple Saturday afternoon serials, where the belief factor is put on hold. It seems that most books on comic book/film characters are weak and with weak plots. I will not purchase another Indiana Jones book, once was sufficient for me to realize they are written more for Middle School readers than for adults."
4,"Great book, fun to read, Max McCoy's best Indy novel yet","Max McCoy didn't write a good book with IndianaJones and the Dinosaur Eggs, but this new book ismore action-packed, exciting, and hard to putdown once you get into it. Max is an intelligentauthor and knows how to write a good Indy adventure featuring humor, suspense and exciting situation (maybe not as exciting as the movies, but those are hard to convey on paper... ""Indy is chased by a huge boulder..."" See what I mean?) All in all, a book worth buying if you are into Indy adventure novels.Carlos DaSilv"
4,2 thumbs up one down,"I loved this game but their was one problem, it was to short. I mean it is really the funnest T rated first person shooter game. but if you want a challenge and if your a experienced gamer you need to play it on hard. Because on hard you need to make sure you are near cover because you can die really really fast. Great storyline two... your happy mad and sad at placesPLUSES___1. you have great graphics ( except for the water)2. Great storyline3. you also depend on your team4. you get to use a variety of weaponsMINUSES___1 and only 1. to short of a storylineI cant wait till i get the 360.... with my HDTV the graphics will be awsome on COD3"
5,Awesome game!,I thought it was a great buy! My husband has enjoyed every minute of playing it.I would recommend this game to anyone.
1,"No sirve (it doesn""t work)","Compre este juego para mi hijo en navidad y no sirvio, lamentablemente me cuesta mas devolverla qie comprar otra, no pasamos una navidad muy agradable, no funciona."
4,GAME IS TOPS!,The game was a great value and lots of fun. the graphics are exciting and very well done.Would recommend for Playstation 2 fans.
5,My boys love this one.,"My sons, 16 and 15 love this game so much. They have worn out 2 discs already. It makes them interested in history too, in my opinion."
4,call of duty : big red one,If you like first person shooters you will like this game. keep up with your men . if you get out in front of them in a battle they will follow killing all enemies behind you. enjoy.
3,Limited,I can't say this is better than version I. It is rather slow and it lacks the adrenaline rush of the earlier one. Also the music lacks drama associated with the historical theme of the game. I did not notice any new features to the game. Get it to complete the series but not as a stand alone game. I am not comparing this to the PC versions as I have not played them but I still feel that the MOH series overall beats COD.
3,"A different WWII shooter in the future, maybe?","First, let me just say that I haven't played this game except for a little on the xbox360. But, and I'm in no way trying to be disrespectful, can't we have a WWII shooter that lets you play missions as the Germans? Even though I'm in no way sympathetic toward Nazis, it would be fun to play as the Germans because: 1) Overall, German troops had better weapons and armor than the allies, and 2) it's always funny to hear your comrades shout stuff in German. The main reason why I haven't bought this game, and probably never will, is that I already own the first Call of Duty for the PC, and once you've played on WWII shooter nowadays it seems like you've played them all. That's why programmers need to do something different with these shooters. The mere fact that this game was another WWII shooter where you can only play as the allies immediately turned me off to it, and I love FPS type games."
2,NO 2 PLAYER CAMPAIGNS,The only reason my friends and I play war games is for 2 player campaigns and good multiplayer levels. THIS GAME HAS NEITHER DO NOT BUY
1,Terrible Language! Misrated!,"My 10 year old son likes war games and I know most of them are rated T because of the violence, but this one is rated T and has VERY BAD language! Never have I heard such foul language in a rated T game! The word G-D (doesn't take much to figure out what word I'm talking about) is used several times. This word should NOT be used in ANY rated T game! The game should be rated M and there should be a warning to parents on games that contain such foul language. My son is very dissapointed because he bought this game not knowing of the language in it and he isn't allowed to play it."
4,Before,A series of vignettes that takes place over 2000 years and follows a seemingly unrelated group of people but it is soon evident a common thread connects them all .Avant stops short of reconciling reincarnation and Christianity it does cause you to explore your own feelings about the collective consciousness.The book leaves you thinking about the lives of the characters much longer than the time it took to read it.haunting and poignant.!!!!
2,Best of Vickie Winans,The CD is disappointing. There are only 2 songs that I like. There is no music on the second CD....just talking. We do not listen to it.
1,"Tyson Floppy Wolf 16""",The stuffed toy is OK. The big problem is that it is depicted on the screen as being grey and white when in fact it is shades of brown and white. Not what I ordered.
4,Pretty good toy,"If you're looking to start a wolf collection or give this to a small child then this is a pretty good sturdy stuffed animal. Two things to watch out for: it's definitely 16"" across so don't buy it thinking of a small animal and the fur, although somewhat realistic, shed a few strands now and then if it's played with too rough. Also the wolf is floppy and light brown and white."
5,madd cute,i bought this toy cause i thought it was cute and it was. its adorable and perfect it can stand up even though it floppy and its just awesome. the only difference between it and the picture is that its colors are a little different. i still love it though and i would recommend it to anyone who loves wolfs or dogs its adorablee
1,Poor Quality,"After receiving this item in damaged packaging (shipper's fault), I finally sat down to watch it and found that it would not play on any of my dedicated DVD players. I finally was able to watch it on my computer. The quality on a large screen was very poor. I decided to keep it only because I really love one of the companies performing. If you can locate an old videotape of this, copy it because that's what the distributor did and not very well. It most certainly is not worth the $44 that they are charging."
4,Dance Black America is a GEM for any dance enthusist!,"I saw this on PBS when it originally was shown and fell in love with it! When it re-aired I taped it on vhs. Even with its grainy shadowy quality I still have that tape at home! And cherish it all the more knowing that a VHS copy costs 89$. Any dancer, dance lover, history lover....MUST own this tape. Snippets of some of the best dancers, choreographers, dance companies in the world."
2,Not worth the price.,"I bought this kit after reading the reviews with some excitement. Perhaps my expectations were too high. My skin did not clear up. I got worse breakouts than I had gotten before! (And yes, I used all products as instructed). My advice? Go see your dermatologist before you drop a roll on this product. I have lost all faith in high-priced skin care lines with too-good-to-be-true promises. This was horrible for my skin and for the same price I got a whole regime from my physician that IS working."
1,NOT ALL THAT,"This product works great apparently, tho not for me. It's going back. This is terrible. I never had acne before this product, and whats with the smell...oh my gosh I tried on the moisturizer and had to hold my breath. If your going to try anything first. Try the eye cream, that works."
4,make up optional,Great product but I Still have residual makeup/dirt after washing with cleanser and need a toner for the rest.
5,Amazing product!!!,"My skin is somewhat blochy... prone to the occasional breakout, and more than occasional blackhead... but overall dull.The philosophy products have minimized small lines and wrinkles, made my skin softer and shinier and given me a glow that I've never seen before!It doesn't really clear up my skin, nor does it break it out. I use their ""clear"" products for flare ups. It does, however, make it much more pleasant to wash my face and the moisturizer feels great.. light yet very soothing.I HIGHLY recommend Philosophy to anyone considering buying face wash. I used proactiv and will never waste that money again."
5,"Great book, very helpful!",This book was recommended to me by my Spanish Teacher and it is a really good resource to use while learning Spanish or just to use for reference. I recommend the 555 Fully Conjugated Verbs to all interested in Spanish.
3,"Ok, but not as expected","This is a handy book to have...only real problem I have is that if you don't know a word in Spanish then it doesn't help you, as it's all in Spanish! How can you find a word and you don't know what you're looking for?? So this book is only useful if you already know Spanish and just need to conjugate the verb."
2,At Least it's Etta... (1 & half stars),"Etta James is one of my all-time favorite artists. But this CD... well, it sure is nothing to get excited about. It is poorly edited from... well, I don't know if it is from one performance or from several - because there is no track information. No producer credits, no dates, no lyrics, no nothing. This is one step up from your average boot-leg CD. By the way, ""Summer Heat"" is also known as ""All The Way Down"" - just one of the many confusing things about this release. So don't waste your money on this CD - there are many more releases by Etta James that deserve your buck."
2,not as pictured,"i bought this ring and was surprised that it is not as pictured. no filagree work and stone is turned in opposite direction. otherwise okay, but was disappointed."
5,What a beautiful book!,I saw this book while browsing in a book store and had to have it. It has beautiful illustrations and easy to understand instructions. In the instructions she encourages you to use your ideas instead of blindly following steps 1 2 3 etc. These wonderful baskets are easy and fun and limited only by your own imagination. Thanks to this book I've used my own creative ideas more than any other crafts I've done. Two thumbs up!!
2,Didn't really care for the book too much,"I was expecting more from this book, and felt disappointed (one from its contents, and two from the condition of it when received - smelled musty). I have another coiled fabric book, and it is heads above this one."
1,Check with Standard Deviants,Please check the Standard Deviants store for the same product for lesser price -Standard Deviants: Algebra Super Pack1. The Basics2. The functions3. Linear Equation4. Quadratic Equation5. Quadratic Roots6. The Quadratic formula7. Polynomials
4,good groovy death metal,"Torture Killer is deathmetal in the veign of Obituary and six feet under. Many of the riffs and the drums have that obituary sound to them except their are no guitar solos, wich isn't bad but there are some parts on here and the new album where they could have replaced some of the crappy slow strumming parts and no nonsence noise parts with a wicked solo and rythm guitar....but o well what we have here is still great easy listening death metal for you all to bang to when drivin around or just chillin with the bong or some beers."
4,Pretty good...,"This book is really quite helpful for ministers, but I think especially seminary students getting ready for their first call. It covers how to deal with difficult behaviors using Family Systems Theory in a no-nonsence kinda way. I was impressed with all the support he uses until you hit about chapter 6. Then the support gets to be a bit much and the information takes longer to find and understand. Otherwise this is a great book for any trying to find new ways of dealing with any difficult behavior, be it ministry, business, or family life."
1,She can't sing...,"Miss Morgana king has no voice, and does not know how to use it, her covers of jazz standards like ""how about you"" are emberessing. She shouldn't try to pull herself off as a jazz singer, or even a pop singer. Buy Teddi King's CD's (a good jazz singer from the 50's) if you must buy any King's cd."
4,Nice pairing of composers,"The Sibelius is quite good. There are lots of good recordings of the 2nd, so I don't know exactly why he picked the 2nd to record. A bolder move would have been to record the 1st symphony. As far as I know, this is the only Symphony Paavo recorded, the elder Järvi recorded them all.The Tubin is also interesting. A brief work, it covers a lot of moods in under 30 minutes. Here we see a connection, the composer is Estonian and so is the conductor. I am not familiar with all the Tubin symphonies, but it makes a nice pair with the Sibelius.With these symphonies we have early 1900s and then 1946. After that the era of this type of symphony was almost over. Tubin composed symphonies to the 1970s.Telarc sound is fine."
1,Sheesh!,"What a pretentious piece of garbage, both the screenplay and the movie itself. One is better served by reading Rimbaud's poems themselves. If you've never read Rimbaud, please do yourself a favor and stay away from the movie and screenplay. Stick with the poems."
1,Redundant Bordom,"Anyone who idolizes Dicaprio should not be allowed to read Rimbaud. In all actuallity, this book(like the movie) was uninformitive and dull. It focuses more on Verlaines psychology than Rimbauds--and as we all know, Verlaine was an ugly man. Im sick of hearing about this piece, it was lame. I only pray that all the teenie boppers of the world don't start reading Rimbaud since they love Dicaprio so much---it might actually give them a glimpse of what real life is like, and we wouldn't want to upset there little minds...now would we?"
5,cover replacement,Obtaining a cover replacement for my camera was excellent as the original one was scratched with use.
1,Damaged product,"Product is of good design and fits onto camera in a similar fashion to the Nikon original. However the version I received has damage to the plastic, making viewing of the LED screen difficult on my D200. I will have to upgrade to the Nikon version. Wish I had thought this out more carefully before clicking the Amazon provided link![...]"
4,the book itself,"Though its not me who used that book, its my 11th grade daughter who requested it that her teacher required them to have one. And as I saw her reading, she finds it good to read."
3,Have your Spanish to English translator nearby,"A very fine read, but it's helpful if you know a little Spanish. He lapses into it throughout the book, especially when speaking about sex it seems. Often one can discern the translation from context, but not always. If you liked ""In the Time of the Butterflies"", by Alvarez, you'll surely like this. I did."
2,Could Have Been Better...,"I received this book from my school as a summer reading book, and promptly attempted to read it. Unfortunately, the story of the Mirabel sisters was so hard to read in the format Ms. Alvarez wrote the book in that I was unable to stick with it. The childhood of the four girls is over in ten pages, but then the time of the book slows down, and each girl has a perspective on one event. Alvarez' portrayal of Maria Theresa in particular was childish, even after she was eightteen. The voice of a person in their writing will change over the years. Patria was melodramatic to the point where one wants to hit her (or the author), and tell her to get a grip. Also, the fact that the sisters were martyrs was drummed into my head so many times, while many other avenues of the personalities of the Mirabel sisters."
2,Review on: In the Time of the Butterflies,"In the time of the Butterflies was a confusing book. This book was confusing to me because it was hard to understand. Some parts of it didnt make since to me. When Dede was writing in her little book, that was hard to understand i didnt know why she was doing that and why she loved the book so much. Even though this book was confusing it was also very good. It had good details, they were very descriptive and they told you alot. For example, Dedes father tells her that she will bury them all in ""silk and pearls"". That line is one of many that is very descriptive. Julia Alvarez did a good job with details, but i still felt that it was very confusing. In the Time of the Butterflies was worth reading."
5,captivating,This intriguing book about the Mirabal sisters was a book I could not put down. I especially liked how the story was told from four points of view. I recommend this book to everyone.
4,A good read,"I found this book enjoyable to read and one I struggled to put down. The characters are life-like and heroic, the story unfolds with them. The structure of the novel is very effective and cleverly interwoven. I typically prefer more detail, however, the simplicity of style is key to its success."
4,I also lived Trujillo,"As a Dominican who lived under Trujillo's dictatorship until his ovethrowing in 1961, I was very taken by Ms. Alvarez' book. Her portrayal of Dominican family life is accurate and lifelike. I remember the trial for the murder of the Mirabal sisters--it was the first televised trial in the history of the D.R. I am also a niece by marriage of General Federico Fiallo who is portrayed in the book, and although as an adult I know he committed heinous crimes under Trujillo's orders, I also want to say that in his private life he was a kind man to his nieces and nephews. He committed suicide when they came to arrest him at his home. All around me when I was a child was the specter of Trujillo and his spies and enforcers. The terror we citizens endured was quite real although we managed to live normal everyday lives. His hand was everywhere. Ms. Alvarez book put into perspective many things that from the point of view of a child you see but fail to digest."
4,The Courage Of TheHuman Spirit,"Julia Alvarez's book In the Time of the Butterflies is a compelling story of 4 sisters and their strrugle through political oppression under the dictator Trujillo. The book pulls the reader into the world and every day life of the Mirabal sisters with just enough detail to keep you turning the pages for more. The story is funny, warm, and heartbreaking all at the same time. The book expresses the culture, couage, strength, and love of all the four sisters with beautiful language, at times like poetry. Alvarez's use of some spanish language intertwined with the english helps the reader indentify even more with the characters. This is definitely a story all people should make the time to hear. It teaches that the courage and love of the human spirit can overcome anything."
4,A great read,"A great read, no matter what your politics are. Instead of making political figures into demons or little plaster saints as we're all so fond of doing, Alvarez draws them as real women who are sometimes heroic and sometimes just trying to get the kids to bed. A gripping story with believable characters and a window on a time and place I knew little about."
4,Very Moving,"A well written fictionalized account of the revolutionary struggles against Trujillo by three of four sisters in the Dominican Replublic. Memorable. The trouble with fictionalized history for me is that after awhile the lines between fact and fiction blur and I don't remember fact from fiction. I tend to stay away from books like this because of my eventual confusion. But, this book is worth it."
5,Women have power!,"This is a wonderful book. A well-written, engaging story of three sisters working in the underground of the Dominican Republic. Loosely based on a true story, this book highlights how women could have power in a time when not only women but all average citizens had no power. This book will keep you up all night until you finish it!"
5,THE BEST BOOK I'VE READ THIS YEAR!!!,It probably tells part of the history of all Latin America countries. Mrs. Alvarez is a great story teller. It's a must read it.
3,In The Time Of The Butterflies,This story is based on dictatorship history in the Dominican Republic with the leader Trujillo. The book shows 4 different point of views for the Mirabal sisters who have had to endure Trujillo's cruel power. This book doesn't always talk about the bad ruling but also adds in humor and suspense in the story which will keep people wanting to read more. I would recommend this book to 9th - 11th grade or above.
4,Excellent story told in an okay way,"This book held my attention, but I never really came to love it or the women characters. Here are some of the reasons I was not completely drawn in:As I read this book, I wondered why the author had told me in the first chapter what would happen to the ""girls."" Maybe she just figured everyone already knew because this was history, so it wouldn't matter. But it did remove any possible suspense, even about how the end came.The ""girls'"" voices were somewhat the same and their reactions to various situations too stock for each of them.The book was over for me once the ""girls"" were grown up and became rebels.I never really believed that they had a huge role in the underground. Except for Minerva, they all seemed too naive.Nevertheless, I do recommend this book because I learned from it about a time and place that I had known nothing about except the name ""Trujillo."""
2,For girls,"As mentioned in the title of my review, In the Time of The Butterflies is a book for women. Sure, there might be some guys who'd like to read it, but I doubt that most would. If you enjoy touchy-feely and descriptions of the menstrual cycle, etc., then this is the book for you."
2,Disapointment,I have bought many books from Amazon and this one was the only disapointment. I do not even want to hold it in my hands without wearing protective gear. The book wasn't the same one that was shown nor did it have the same cover pictue. Very misleading. The pages are dark & dirty...wonder where it has been...
3,In The Time of the Butterflies,"The book I purchased was listed as ""like new"", but when I recieved it , it was quite used and had writing in the text!!Quite disappointing!!"
1,Boring!!,this is the most boring book in the world.. how ppl write such book and become famous!! gosh.. i fell asleep every paragraph.... if i can have negative star.. i would have pick that already... 1 star is too much for this book!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Canned reviews,"This is a touching and poignant work, but I get really tired of reading a bunch of canned reviews on the Amazon.com website. The first two reviews I read on this book contained identical elements."
5,Not just another latinamerican dictatorial account.,"Many people have written about dictatorships in latinamerica. Suffice it to say that this is one of the better ones. I love Garcia Marquez, but I think this book is better than his Autumn of the Patriarch.Naturally, if you have the chance to read the Spanish original version, much better. However, the current translation is very good."
5,Becoming a Mirabel,"Reading about the Mirabel sisters brought them closer to life than I would expect. Not only could I fully imagine them, I felt like they became part of my family, like Dede, Mate, Minerva or Patricia would ask me for opinion or something. This made the tragic truth even more painful. I cried like I lost a family member."
5,A truly never-ending story,"Certainly the Mirabal sisters will never be forgotten by the Dominican people, but anyone who reads this book will carry their story forever. Alvarez's style is perfectly suited for this type of story -- feminine and strong, allowing the reader to ""grow up"" with the sisters as they do.As I finished ""In the Time of Butterflies"", I was emotional not only because of the moving story but also for the simple fact that the story had ended."
5,Las Mariposas given a new life ...,"The four Mirabel sisters lived in the Dominican Republic during the reign of Trujillo. Known as Las Mariposas, ""the Butterflies"", they became symbols of hope to a country in despair. Ms. Alvarez pays tribute to the spirit of the sisters (Dede, Patria, Minerva and Maria Teresa) in this beautifully written novel. She has created a fictional account of both the sisters and the events that took place. As each `sister' is given the chance to tell us her story, I was pulled further in as the events that unfolded tugged at my heart and showed me what courage really is.I really enjoyed this novel and will definitely be reading more of Julia Alvarez. I highly recommend to people interested in Las Mariposas, the Dominican Republic and historical fiction."
4,"A good book, but it is historical fiction, not history","What I really enjoyed about this book is that it gave me a very good understanding of just what it would be like to grow up under a dictatorship, which is very difficult for those of us who grew up in a free country to truly comprehend.It especially highlights just how courageous Las Mariposas (the revolutionary sisters) must have been. The reader must keep in mind, however, that this is a fictionalized biography, and it is not historically accurate."
3,In the time of the butterflies,This book is great for all kinds of people who just love to read. This book also talks about some history in the Dominican Republic and their bad dictator Trujillo who has really affected the Dominican Republic as a nation with his cruel powers. Julia provides a point of view from 4 different characters in the story about how the people there are scared of his cruel dictatorship while putting in some humor at the same time. I recommend this book for 9th to 11th grade.
4,Women on the Uprise,"I love that this book is written from what is supposed to be the perspective of the four sisters. Each gives their own voice about how their involvment in the revolution against the Trujillo dictatorship.I also like that these women were real characters, not just caricatures of people. They had their flaws and they were truly human."
4,One of the best,This book is one of the best politically based books i have ever read. I read it for an english honors project and i have found the story an amazing one. it is a wonder why so little people know about the mirabel sisters. i would recommend this book to anyone who has the courage to try something new.
1,could not get into it at all,"DIDN'T GET INTO THE BOOK AT ALL, IT WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE , KEPT READING OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT DID NOT GRASP WHAT THE STORY WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ABOUT. SORRY BUT YOU WANTED MY RATING AND THE RATING IS VERY LOW ."
4,Inspiring Book,"I personally loved the book, In The Time of the Butterflies. It was a truly moving book, and I have never read anything like it before. The deep description really gives the reader a feel for the severity of the situation that the young Mirabel girls are going through. The book portrays the courage, devotion, and love of all the sisters in their fight to overthrow the harsh government of Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. They are truly heros and Alvarez does an amazing job of sending their heroic message to the reader. I consider the Mirabel sisters to be amazing role models for their courage and persistance. They fought for what they believed in no matter what the consequences, and overcame many obstacles which would've made most people give up. This truly was a great book."
4,Pink Revolution,"I appreciated the fact that, the author could so beautifully intertwine the harsh, cold, brutal fight of the revolution with the passions of the women involved for their husbands, their children, and for one another."
5,Great infusion of facts and fiction,"You can go to any website about the Maribel girls from the Dominican Republic and find out the history. But in this story you can make a connection with them as people. Although this story is based on true events that happened in Dominican history, the characterization of these women is all Julia Alvarez. Great story, great writing, great novel."
2,Not much of a mystery,"This is the second-last published Miss Silver book, and I don't know how old Patricia Wentworth was when she wrote it, but this is a very weak book. There is no mystery at all because we know all along who does the murder and why. But we have to wade through repetition over and over and Jenny's story is retold. I lost track, but it had to be at least five times. I have undertaken to read the entire Miss Silver series, and it has been worth it, up to this book. Since there is only one left, I will read that as well. After 30 books, it's something that I should do, but I'm going to find it difficult after this one. For those of you who haven't read Miss Silver, skip this book, and read some of the others. Some of them are really excellent."
4,Useful text,"This a very useful text for students and experienced users alike. The book is the right level of information regarding instrumentation, basic concepts and provides useful information on various applications of the technology. Definitely a must buy for the novice and student -- likely a useful reference text for the experienced user."
1,Badly written,"The confusing presentation, clumsy writing, and numerous factual errors make this book almost unreadable."
1,Ehh,"This game is OK for patient people. The levels in this are not as hard as they are frustrating. If the little guy in this had a fairy (although Mika is very close to one)It would be the Legend of Zelda. I give this game a thumbs down, but this is just my opinion."
3,freshness of product,The cake was very tasty but it could have been fresher. It was a little dryer than others that I have purchased.
4,An interesting read,"It has been two years or so since I read the book so my mindset is not fresh. However, I found this book to be interesting and well worth reading if you have an interest in Carolina Parakeet. Snyder presents details about the bird's Florida range and postulates that the species may have been present into the 1930's. I found the information fascinating and worth considering."
2,Uninspired writing,"This book was a disappointment. I'm very interested in the topic but much of the book reads like a scientific paper. There is a lot of good, interesting information but, unless you're particularly interested in Carolina parakeets, as I am, suffering through the writing is probably not worth it.The crux of the book is his postulation that the parakeets diet of cockleburs made them toxic to most predators thus their bright feathers, gregariousness and ability to ""sleep"" at night. These abilities were no match against humans who killed them with ease. One shot took out droves and then the survivors would gather around the fallen, making shooting the rest even easier.Because cockleburs grow around human dwellings the parakeet was drawn to areas where they came in contact with livestock and other sources of exotic diseases, conceivably nail in the coffin for the parakeet."
4,Nice bag,"Nice bag, lots of space, lightweight. Sturdy, like the long handles. Overall the best bag of it's kind that I have found."
5,Great every day tote bag.,"I was looking for a water resistant tote that could fit a 17"" laptop, some small binders, books and my lunch. This bag is great as an every day tote. It is lightweight, so no added heft to your load, and has a flat, structured bottom so it stays where you put it. I also like all the inner pockets - great for odds and ends, pens, flash drives, etc. The outside pockets work great for things like water bottles and umbrellas. I haven't tested it in the rain or bad weather yet, but did spill a glass of water on it and the water beaded and ran off, so I'm hopeful it will hold up in the winter. Other reviewers use this bag for travel and I would agree that it would be a great carry-on bag or one to stash in your luggage for use on a trip.***Updated: I have been using this bag for months and it's held up extremely well. I've also used it as a carry-on bag and a weekend bag and it worked great."
4,"needs LONGER PADDED STRAPS, but still a *GREAT* bag","Fantastic bag, but straps not quite long enough to comfortable sling across your body, especially when wearing a big jacket or with a backpack on. I am constantly wishing this bag had longer and PADDED straps, because they can dig in when bag is loaded. I am considering having longer padded straps sewn in, because the bag itself is FANTASTIC. Still looks brand new after a years use, has not worn out at all, it's also water repellant, and dries quickly if it does get wet. The expandable feature is A+++. When I wear a back pack this bag is really annoying to carry-- not long enough to sling across body, and too long to carry in hand or hold closely right under arm."
5,Perfect Travel Tote,This lightweight tote looks good and holds a lot. Great as a flight carry on bag. The zipper top makes you feel more secure. There are outside pockets too. I think it is pretty waterproof.
4,Too good not to be bigger,"The bag is well made and attractive. I would love a larger version to accommodate more items and shoes for a long weekend road trip with some additional inside pockets for small items. Also a lighter, bright color lining would it make easier to find things inside. Great for plane travel as is though."
3,too small,"I have had one of their purses for a few years and love it. I needed a repalcement for an oversized American Tourister tote bag and this seemed perfect. However, the dimensions listed are misleading--the 'width' is measured at the top, rather than the bottom (13"") and the zipper gusset would only add height (and only 3"") if the bag were empty. I had a serious talk with myself and sent it back rather than keep a beautiful bag that doesn't quite do the job."
4,"Good, but a little too fancy.","The only complaint I have with this rolling pin is the price. If I had to buy a rolling pin again, I would get a plain, flared wooden pin with no handles, which only costs a few dollars, or just go to the hardware store and get a wooden dowel for even less.The material this pin is made of sticks to almost everything I've rolled with it, so you basically need to flour it every time you're going to push on it. A wooden pin is much easier to use, because the surface is rough. The smooth surface of this OXO pin is just way too polished. It's comfortable and good at what it does, but I'm more impressed by something that can do the same thing for much, much less money."
4,perfect but a little long,I love this rolling pin and would buy it again. I have a small kitchen and it barely fit in a drawer.
2,Sticky Pin,"The handles are comfy and it rolls beautifully--until it sticks. If you're looking for one of those teflon-coated pins that nothing ever sticks to, keep looking. As for me, I'll probably go back to my marble pin. The main redeeming feature of this pin is that it's dishwasher safe."
1,Save Your Money..Don't Buy This,"My twirling pins always broke after a while so I finally bit the bullet purchased this about a year ago, after all it was three times more than a wooden one. What a big mistake! It stopped ""rolling"" about six months ago so I ended up using it like a French pin, what the heck? I then decided to ditch it and bought a $12.00 French rolling pin, which I should have done to begin with. Once you get the hang of it, the French type allows you much better control overall. Martha Steward sells a very well made one and it will most likely be the only one I will ever need from now on."
2,Broke after one use.,"I was very excited to use this pin, yet while rolling out my first crust the barrel broke off the handles and would no longer roll correctly. Very disappointing!"
1,Broke with the first use!,"In general, I think Oxo products are pretty well made, and when I saw the previous reviews for this product, I decided to purchase it. My high hopes didn't last long... With the first use of the rolling pin (to roll pasta dough), one of the handles broke. This was likely just a single product defect rather than a design defect, but I wasn't willing to test it out again. On the bright side, Amazon was very responsive to my refund request."
4,Good. Big.,This is great rolling pin. Great material that doesn't stick. Weighted right so it is say to grip. But it is a big rolling pin. We have the proper storage so i don't mind but you should be aware that this is a monster.
5,I think its a kicken game,I bought it around cristmas sometime last year or soAnd me have to say i find it kickenits very simple made and what you do is walk punch jump and kickyou simply walk in this karate house and people come towards you as you walk they can come bothe in front or behind youso keep you fingers ready to puch or kick all the time!even though it simply made it has several combinations especially at the bosses when you have to mix between ducking and jumping and move fast before the boss swings his weapon beacuse that takes loads of yoour enegryalso watch out!on some levels things fall on yer head!
5,Sal Writes from the Heart!,"I worked with Sal for a short time prior to his departure from San Francisco. I sure miss his company but after reading ""Love, Sal"" it's like he's back in town! His writing is from the heart as he describes his many adventures throughout San Francisco with his encounters and the people that touched his life such as Sher, Irl, and Max! If you like to read about sexual adventures then get this book! Sal knows how to bring it home in reality.Congratulations Sal!!"
4,Good Introduction to the Mind Sciences,"Contrary to what other reviewers say, I humbly submit that the booklet is an excellent guide to understanding what Mind Sciences believe and how they compare to Christianity.The booklet is organized as follows:1. Introduction to the various groups (Christian Science, Religious Science, Unity School).2. Overview of the group's theology by using the groups own quotes.3. Tips for witnessing to these groups.4. Bibliography for more sources for study.5. Comparison chart showing what the Mind Sciences believe about God, Jesus Christ, Death and Resurrection, Sin, Salvation, Doctrine of Revelation, Reincarnation vs. Resurrection and how these beliefs compare with what the Holy Bible says.The booklet is brief but is packed with valuable information. As for the other reviewers: honestly evaluate what the Mind Sciences say and how they truly compare with the Bible.Recommended!"
2,The Attack on Reincarnation Here is Racist,"If Christian Science is a declining movement, then why bother to expend ink on the movement? While I appreciated the critical analysis of mind sciences philosophy, I was left wondering if the authors rationalist approach did not also undermine the esoteric and idiosyncratic hermeneutics that charismatic Christians also indulge in. The book is marred by an ugly racist attack on reincarnation- some liberation theologians would argue that Christian dualism has also legitimated environmental carnage and destructive social hierarchies. But why bother to attack a declining philosophical framework anyway?"
1,"Weakly developed characters, no dramatic tension.","Wow, this book is bad. The characters are poorly realized, their emotions and actions are cliched and unconvincing, and we're not made to care about them or their relationships at all. I generally like both vampire fiction and books that focus on African American women so I thought this would be a definite winner for me, but the prose is boring and the politics are heavy handed. Again, I don't mind my fiction with a political bent, but the ""message"" can't overshadow or replace the literary craftsmanship as is the case here.I will say that I have also read Jewelle Gomez's short story anthology and found it to be better than The Gilda Stories, which was an unqualified waste of my time."
5,Even Exchange,"I read Jewel's book when it first came out in 1991 and one thing that has stayed with me in the past 16 years is the memory of the following passage when she instructs the girl she raised as a vampire.""And as you take from them you must reach inside. Feel what they are needing, not what you are hungering for. You leave them with something new and fresh, something wanted. Let their joy fill you. This is the only way to share and not to rob.""Jewel shared with us something that is very much lacking in the world today."
5,High End Chairs at a Great Value,"I have also rated the Strathwood Falkner table - very highly. But, I love the chairs even more. We chose to buy six armchairs, not the side chairs and we are so happy with our choice. In my opinion they look fantastic, the shape is classic and the quality is excellent. I live in Florida and they have already been rained on 30 times in the short time span since we purchased them - and luckily it looks like it is gong to hold up exceedingly well in our wet, humid, and hot climate. Our dining set has received numerous compliments, and I feel certain we will enjoy it for several seasons. At first I was not sold on the cushions, but once I realized how quickly they wicked the water away after being soaked in the rain I was sold. They literally do not hold the water, if you put them on one end the water drains out very efficiently. I would highly recommend these chairs!"
2,"Love these, BUT","I bought the two-seater lounge, two chairs with ottomans, the dining table, 4 armless dining chairs and 2 dining chairs with arms. I love all of it and it looks great but there is one major problem. After 2 seasons the finish on the arms of several pieces is bubbling up and cracking off, exposing the aluminum underneath. We have used the pieces in a normal fashion - no excessive wear and tear that should cause this type of problem. I'm hoping the remaining pieces will hold up OK. The other downside to this furniture is the pillow are a bit difficult to keep clean, and because the table is slatted, things fall through a lot. I'm thinking of getting a plexiglass top for it. But other than the problem with the finish, I really love the furniture."
4,Good with a few exceptions,"The styling of this set is beautiful which you can see very clearly in the images and also very sturdy however the craftsmanship has a little to be desired. Two of the four chairs I ordered have a little chip in the painted finish and I wonder if that will cause the paint to bubble and peel down the line. The metal itself, where it curves, is not a nice smooth curve, in some areas it appears to be dented but then when you look closely at it, no, it's just the way it was created.The cushions feel a little cheesey though, I don't know how to describe it and the color is not beige, it's like a very light creamy yellow so I cancelled the umbrealla on back order and will most likely go buy all new cushions with a matching umbrella elsewhere.Overall I'm happy with the set for the price. It's very comparable in look to sets that cost way more and the tradeoff seems worth it."
5,Beautiful on my patio!,I love these chairs. I bought 6 to go with a glass table I already had. They are very comfortable and sturdy. I did spray the seats with a fabric protector to help keep them clean.
1,suprisingly disappointing!,"This book is not as informative as you think. It rambles on about every person in America should know. Any person with common sense could figure these stats, facts, etc. found in this book. It was a waste of my time and money."
5,Stolen 3 times... This book is hot!!!,This book is so hot that it's been stolen from my office library 3 times. I'm on my 4th purchase of this book. I felt like I could have an intellegent conversation about any aspect of the television business after using this book. It is my main resource for getting quick answers that are easy to understand. This is required reading for those getting started and a great resource for those that have been in the industry a while. It also includes a computer disk containing forms such as U.S. Copyright registration and others found in the book that you can import to your word processor.Ron HebertProducer2002 Emmy Awards - Pacific Southwest Chapter
5,An excellent resource,"This book (textbook) is an excellent resource for just about everything in TV. The disk included is a great utility to have for printing out your own contracts. I only with this book could be updated, say, every two years."
3,A presentation on the business,"I was overwhelmed when I got it beucase it's bigger than the ""This business of Film"" but it doesn't cover topics deeply. I expected to have more about topics like Syndication rules and Prime Time Access."
2,Not as good as some of his work,"We already had his hilarious Greatest Hits Vol. 2 and were really looking forward to this one being as funny, but it didn't even come close. We didn't even finish watching it.Would not recommend this video."
2,Not what it was cracked up to be.,"My wife is from Maine, and we are always interested in MAINE humor. Bob Marley, however is just like every other foul mouthed comedian on the circuit. AFter a while, it was just embarassing to listen to him and I'm certainly not a prude being a 20+ year military retiree.John Dorgan"
3,Too tiny,"I ordered this miniature deck and found out that it is a little too small. So I tried the pocket size and I love it more. Besides from the size, it is all good."
3,big disappointment,I love most Rider Waite decks but this miniature deck turned out to be a big flop. The scanning job was done poorly and some of the figures look distorted. The standard miniture deck is a lot better. Also the coloring isn't sooo special for my personal taste. I still prefer the original version light colors to Albano's or even to the Universal version.I recently found a Lo Scarabeo edition of the 1910 version and the colors are just perfect.
5,Miniature Rider-Waite Cards are Great!,I found this set to be very useful while travelling and the detail on the cards were very accurate. This deck is great for the beginner because it is easy to read and straight forward. I would highly recommend this deck to anyone interested in learning the tarot.
4,"Interesting characters, different locale","This is the 2nd book in a series by Colin Cotterill featuring a 72-year-old mystery-solving coroner in communist-occupied Laos after the Vietnam War. It is an extremely interesting book due to the descriptions of the area, the people and the government, as well as quirky characters which are believable. Mr. Cotterill does an excellent job of bringing not only the people but the country and its mores to life with humor and an slyly observant eye. Two thumbs up!"
1,Don't buy this item!,I will never buy anything sold or shipped from Target again. Every single item in the package was broken and shattered because they put a small box inside of a large box with NO packing material around it. Now I have to go and purchase a new gift set because this one is beyond repair. I should have listened to the previous reviewer. Do not buy this item unless you want a box full of broken and shattered glass. I would have rated this item 0 stars if possible.
4,On-line Registry,This item was a part of a friend's on-line registry. I shopped on-line and it arived just within days after her bridal shower. If you are a bride doing a registry and have many out of town guests I highly recommend Amazon's registry they are the simplest and the strongest for getting the packages to you in a timely manner. And if you are a guest of an out of town wedding and can shop on Amazon I highly recommend it a well because they are again the most timely in their shipping department.
2,Evans Min-Emad damper system,"I ordered it and found out that the product doesn't improve the sound dampening at all. For heavey heads like remo power-stroke 3 I would not recommend, but if you have a thinner head that has alot resonance, then may it will work. Other than that, I would not waste my money on the product!Keo"
2,BAD!,"It is a waste of money, it barely changes the tone of the drum. I recommend getting some damper pads instead."
4,Clampping with Bessey,"I bought 2 of this clamps base on my experience with BESSEY heavy duty clamps I already own (Model TG5.512).This LM4.012model was a good clamp, but I was expecting it to be heftier. Their TG5.512 are absolutely superb. I was not expecting this one to be like the TG's but I expected more. for example, the clamping screw could have been larger to offer stronger clamping.I also expected the end of the clamping screw (the one that contacts the object), to be one solid piece. Well it is a stamped piece. So it is hollowed with a piece of plastic to cover that end. It is not like the TG's end which is one solid piece. I expected a solid piece from a BESSEY clamp.Last but not least, my TG's heavy duty ones have proudly engraved ""Made in Germanny."" These LM's do not even show any ""Made in..."" engravings. So, who know? In summary, they are good and do the job but I expected better...Heftier."
4,Cool Gift,"I purchased this for my 8 year old nephew as a Christmas present - it was his favorite gift that year. It's a lot bigger than most RC cars, sounds cool and runs well. He couldn't get enough of playing with it - very durable."
5,A classical piece of work,"This dictionary is a classical and remarkable work on Freemasonry. It's a good source for the freemason investigator, although it should be confronted with other sources as well. It focuses on the primal and moral significance on the symbols, and gives some relevant data on many topics."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this clock for my 6 year old's room so that she could get up for school and little easier. I liked the fact that Barbie's voice could wake her up instead of a buzzing alarm or radio feature. I did read the reviews which seem to favor liking this product. WELL DON""T LISTEN TO THEM!!! This clock STINKS! The time does not work properly. I set the proper time and it never stayed true to the time. I tried it again last night with the Barbie voice alarm set for 7:15am and at 2 AM GUESS WHAT I HEARD??? BARBIE - I ran into her room and unplugged the junk clock!! The radio tuner barely comes in for reception. The clock itself IS adorable, but I am off to Target to get the buzzing $10 alarm clock!!!!! Don't waste your time - just go to Target or Walmart!!"
1,not worth it,"The product arrived in good condition but didn't work properly. I tried a replacement, but that unit was defective as well, so I had to just opt for a refund. I would pick a different alarm clock."
1,"Item not as described, does not work, can't return it.","My wife and I bought this for our 6 year old daughter as a gift. First and foremost the item we received was not what we ordered or as pictured in the description. Well we didn't that was too big a deal, so we opened it and let our daughter use it. Not even 24 hours into use and the clock randomly changes time as if the buttons are stuck?!?! Well, I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it was fine for another 24 hours and then the same problem comes back. Sometimes just the minutes adjust, sometimes just the hour, sometimes both. I emailed the seller as to how to return the item. Well of course I have to pay for shipping as expected, but restocking fee's and all that and now I've lost the $40 spent originally AND I have to pay them to take it back?!!?!? RIP OFF!"
1,A clock that does not tell time,"I am just now getting ready to wrap the birthday gift for my granddaughter, just placed a new battery in it and listened to some stations. When I went to set the time and alarm, there is no display! I kind of resent being sent an item that is not in new and workable condition. What is my recourse?"
1,Clock Doesn't Keep Time!,"We purchased this clock for my 6-year-old. It's adorable - but it shouldn't be considered a clock because it DOESN'T KEEP TIME. It is always fast. We thought maybe it was just the one we received, so we returned it and ordered a SECOND clock. Guess what? It's fast, too. Chalk it up to bad luck? Maybe, but either way, we'll be purchasing a (probably-not-so-cute) reliable timepiece for her, instead."
3,Would have given higher rating if it had worked the first time!,"The Clock and box looked like it had been returned from somebody else! Called and the person said they would exchange it, after placing me on hold two times so he could get authorization, even though it was purchased a week before their deadline and ""Even though it didn't cost very much!"" and he gave me an exchange number and told me he would send an email with free postage that I could just print out. Finally got the email, mailed it back today January 5th. Wait and see if I actually get the item returned to me. Got the clock back today, January 27th! Looks like the clock was fixed, so far, I was told it would be replaced but looks like the same box."
4,"A26 and B26 heavily covered, A20, not as well.","My father was a crew chief in the 410th BG, 646th Squadron for:(A-20G-15 8U*H Mary Ruth (43-9904) shot down on d-day nite, 15 missions(A-20G-30 8U*H Mary Ruth II (43-9492) survived 59 missionsAs you can see, I was looking for info mainly on the A-20, the 410th BG, 646th Squadron, but more of the book covers A-26 and B-26. Dont get me wrong, it is a good book and covers the A-20 to a degree."
1,RIP OFF,I must be an idiot because I thought I was getting a kit of clamps for a great deal. It's one stinking clamp for a rip off price. Why show a picture of a whole bunch of clamps when you get just one. I have bought the same clamp at Home Depot for about $3.50 This is truly a misrepresentation of reality.
5,These little suckers are great!!!,"I own a wide variety of Bessey clamps, pipe clamps, quickgrip clamps and specialty clamps. As a firm believer in the maxim that ""you can never have too many clamps"" I bought 5 of these last year. I am so impressed by their ease of use that they are the ones that I reach for most often. Needless to say, they won't be of much help in gluing up panels (unless you're trying to improve the allignment at the ends of the boards). I use these clamps at the drill press, band saw, router table and table saw to secure temporary fences. I also use them any time that I mount a tool (hollow-chisel mortiser; grinder) or my dovetail jig on my workmate. I use them when dry-fitting face frames to hold the pieces in alignment and anywhere that I need a small clamp with good holding power. They also excel in clamping laminations and I've used them for that enough that I realized that I should have bought more."
4,Sturdy and very handy little clamp,"I picked up several of these for glue-ups and they are really very nice for the money. I can get plenty of pressure out of them and the pads seem to be pretty sturdy. My only minor complaint has more to do with the style of bar-clamp design. They can be a little fussy to get adjusted as the serrations tend to catch if I am trying to adjust them with one hand. I know, minor issue, but I annoying nonetheless."
4,Little Brother Clamp,"I like this clamp for all my light weight clampping that I do, such as clampping a part to a fixture to do some sawing or other kind of work. I just got a few of the 4"" and 6"" clamps, so I am finding out what other uses there are for these clamps.The only thing I would change is the red handle could be at least 3/4"" to 1"" in dim. so my hands can get a better grip."
4,Graphic Designer's eye candy,"Truly inspiring. This book is a good idea generator, with page after page of projects organized by different graphic elements employed: materials, die cuts, add-ons, embossing, formats, bindings, graphic devices, text, and inks. I gave the book 4 stars because it really lacked more explanation to each example given. I really wished that they would have included what the pictured project was used for and other helpful information like exactly what type of material was used. I suppose that information couldn't be disclosed in a book for the public?? Despite all that, the book still proves useful. I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
2,1000 Graphic Elements,"As a graphic designer, I did not find this book very useful in generating ideas. There is very minimal info about the pieces featured and some photos are unnecessarily close-up and you cannot get a sense for the project."
5,Good quality,"The book arrived in brand new condition and in a timely manner, I was very happy with the service."
1,First book I've ever returned...,"This book was very disappointing. Aside from the fact that the elements would be very expensive to produce, the designs lacked any strength. Each project seemed to be more about the designer's ego than about the client. Additionally, the book's ""icon"" layout was cumbersome and meant having to refer to the legend much too often. Granted, some books are more useful than others, but I have never purchased a book that hasn't given me some bit of inspiration, no matter how small... until now. I found the book and its designs to be much too self-indulgent to be useful. This is the first book I have ever returned."
4,Chock full of awesomeness!!,"From cover to cover, this book contains designs and layouts that cover almost the entire scope of materials, techniques, styles and trends in dramatic design today. A must have in every designers personal library. I highly recommend this book"
2,Coaster Table,"unfortunately arrived badly damaged, did not open the box for a couple of weeks until we could put it together, drawers cracked, several pieces broken."
5,Great Winder,Works great on battery or electric. Very quiet - can't hear it run. Comes with 2 watch cuffs. Has a 3 year warranty. Good quality product. It may be more expensive then the real cheap units but this looks like a quality product that will last for years.
2,Silent Majority,"May we never forget the result of the 1972 presidential election. Nixon, who had been in charge of the Vietnam war for 4 years, defeated a candidate (McGovern, whose ONLY stance was one of anti-war), with the most lopsided victory in the history of our country. With 49 out of 50 states going to Nixon, the true mood of the country was shown to be something quite different from what the media projected by concentrating on the children on campus and the anti-war faction."
4,"Very basic, but nice","I read all the reviews about how easy this music was. Obviously, it's very hard to quantify how easy or hard based on experience. I was looking for something I could just sit down and play without having to practice at it, and it's perfect for that. There's nothing more than two flats or sharps, but you definitely need to have been playing for a few years to really enjoy the music. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is almost too simple. You lose something in some of the songs when it is simplified too much, but that's the price I had to pay to get something at the level I wanted. It's also very hard to sing along with, because he uses lots of high notes without puting in any lower notes you could shoot for instead. That said, however, it's perfect for what I wanted."
2,Not for the beginner Student,"I read the reviews for this book and thought that it would be ideal for a beginner piano student like myself. Unfortuantely, I was disappointed. It is for the more advanced beginner student. I liked the song choices in the book, but I have to wait a while before I can actually play most of the songs in the book."
5,I'm Happy,"Even though I'm still learning, this book has some songs I really like. It's a pretty good book full of great sheet music."
4,Zelda,"I have this game, but I've never played it because I got it when I was really little, and about five or six years ago my Nintendo broke. :( So, I really don't know what I should rate it. I don't really know much about the game, except what I've heard about it either."
4,First Zelda game I played,The Legend of Zelda is the first Zelda game I played. I didn't think it was fantastic but it led to other Zelda games and was the start of my favorite fantasy adventure series. The music is great. It is very haunting and fairy tale like. You go from dungeon to dungeon fighting enemy boss after enemy boss. I never passed this game. Maybe some day I'll go back to the game and get to the end finally.
4,In the begining...,This started all of the zelda series and it is still going today! I loved zelda ever since i played this game so now i have played mostly all of them. This game is fun and all but the layout is confusing and from this game up to the snes zelda they r all the same type of layout. That is why i like the newer ones with the first person view. But this is the first one i played and it still makes me happy when i play it. I mean it has a good replay value. It has great music and sound for the nes and i played this game on the nes the most because it has a save feature which is amazing for back in its day. I wish that mario and other games had save too so it would make it much eaiser. But zelda would almost be impossible to beat if it did not have save on it because it would take so long. Mabey thats why it was such a good seller. I love this game but it is very hard when u get far enough into it.
5,Fun RPG worth playing for anyone!,"I have had the opportunity to get my NES working again and had this game lying around so I took some time and played it. I streamed and recorded the whole few hours it took me to get through it for the first time. The story plot is pretty fun for it being the LoZ series. It is very simple for the controls and is worth playing over again. I enjoyed the 5+ hours I played and beat of it (I had to keep playing cause well the battery inside was dead and didn't realize it). I didn't get to do the 2nd quest cause the battery I had in mine died, but I didn't mind really. I still will play it and maybe find a replacement battery for it someday. Graphic wise it is simple pixels like most of the older games were, which to me I really don't mind cause I came from the Atari era and it's a great retro game to play. If you love RPG's this one is a definite classic to pick up with a NES!"
5,The First True Legend,"(Note:This is the gamecube version)This was released in 1987,a full 21 years ago.All that time and it still appeals.The Legend of Zelda launched the RPG genre in games.The story is rather simple though.Link,a young boy,has to save Princess Zelda,who has been kidnapped by Ganon.The graphics are not that great now,but that does not take any fun out of gameplay.The dungeons are very easy to beat,though it is almost impossible to beat them without losing a life.Overall this is one Zelda title that will always be remembered as a true legend .Buy it.You will love it."
5,The first and best zelda,"Ok, i just got this game yesterday and i am already to level4.But of course zelda games never end after this i get a second quest which i think is awesome. me and my mom play this game all the time we have had alot of fun we are big zelda fans and we have all of the zeldas this is the best one ever even our cats like to watch oh and if you play video games and have an nes, snes, or n64 and your mom keeps bugging you about your jello brain buy her DR.MARIO sometimes i cant play NES because my mom wont stop playing DR.MARIO Truly this is a cool game!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Extreme Classics,"In my eyes, the best game ever, besides pong. Some people may argue otherwise because of the power of the original NES. But this game, an angel in plastic, set gamers free of bad RPG's with no storyline, gameplay, or fun. The Legend of Zelda blew away the cover and started the most sucessful gaming series ever, and possible the funnest. You may not agree, seeing as how the original Gameboy even had better graphics than a NES. The point I am trying to make is; With awesome gameplay, an amazing storyline, and all out fun. Be prepared to hear from me later. See-ya"
4,Outstanding!,"The Legend of Zelda is worth the buy (on the Collector's edition for GameCube only these days.)The first thing ya' might be asking: Why 4 stars? Well there some 4 cm. flaws on the Collectors edition, which i'm refering to. The grpahics, as the results of the back-then-video-games, are terrible. Me? Why, this game is splendid! It's just you never even know where Ganon is hiding in the first part of the game.Overall: Awesome."
5,takes me back!,It plays just how i remember... the graphics and sound and difficulty was just as I remember. the game played flawlessly. PERFECT!!
3,It had cracks.,I was so excited to play this and when i got it the game itself had a huge dent in it. I never got to play it because my nintendo itself also doesnt work. Other than that though the game is good.
1,time to safe money here...,"Well, if you're looking for a hunting game, trust me,- you shouldn't buy this one. If you're looking for an ""EGO-Shooter"", you can but shouldn't either. There's no 3rd person perspective which makes defending of charging predators much harder (just like the first part of D.H.), no arms, equipment or tags to choose. I would recommend one of the 'Big Game Hunter' series or the new (at least here in Europe/Germany) 'Cabela's Outdoor Adventures', where you can go fishing as well. The 'One' star's just for the graphic."
1,Buy Dangetous Hunts 1 or Bigame Hunter 2004-6,"I was really dissapointed when I rented this game(I beat it in 45 minutes!). Its not really hunting at all!, its more of an adventure game. Its like Lego star wars (have fun beating it then get bored of it) so just buy the first one. PS. Im so glad I didnt buy it!!"
1,"A Terrible Letdown, a Waste of Money and Time","I cannot even begin to describe how disappointed I was with this game. The first Dangerous Hunts game was a blast to play. It was just like real hunting, with the added thrill of having to deal with wild animals that attack.But this game is horrendous. It is an adventure style game where you follow around an amazingly annoying one eyed man who tells you what to do and doesnt bother to help you at all. Moreover, his vocabulary is limited to two or three dumb remarks.You cannot hunt in the traditional sense. You cannot do anything except the stupid little tasks that the one eyed guide wants you to do.This is NOT a true hunting game. Stay away and don't waste your money on this piece of crap. Get the original Dangerous Hunts game, instead."
2,Not a follow-on to Dangerous Hunts!,"I loved the original Dangerous Hunts game. Not only is that a great game, but you can keep going back to it after you have ""finished"" it and choose from the many different hunts and still have fun.The D.H.2 is really just a role playing game. You don't choose your next adventure, or your weapons, etc. - you are just given a weapon and mission (there is not a lot of realism either). The few ""hunts"" in there, are so lacking (compared to the original) that you would not want to go back and do them over. It's also a really short game.(...). It is sort of fun. But for the length of the game, the lack of realism, etc. (...)."
5,Someone Has To Die Tonight,It is easy to tell the dedication to detail that went into this book. It is facinating how one person can influence the better judgment of several people. That these people were little more than children is mind blowing. Taking a life with no remorse. I look forward to the rest of the story!
2,Purchased for my daughter,"The print on the board was not the same one that was shown on the Web Site when I placed my order. Also seems flimsy. Daughters comment? Ahhhhh,"
1,Wrong unilateral decision,"For whatever reason, the company decided to send me a product I did not order. The design on the board is nothing like the one pictured. Very feminine for my boys. Not worth the return hassle, we will just gove it away and buy from someone else."
3,Wrong Product,I was getting this product based on the look and finish of it per the picture. The finish has changed and I could not get the one pictured as that had been disontinued. The board itself was fine it just did not have the colors I needed as I was giving it as a gift
5,A New Classic,"I bought this book for my two year old niece, Lilly and we adore it. Patti Stren has created a character in Elliot Kravitz who lives in us all. Elliot has won a place in my heart along with the Runaway Bunny and Corduroy. I hope that Lilly will still be reading Hug Me at my age. I wouldn't doubt it. Thanks Patti Stren. You have touched us."
3,Ok,"The item came quickly, but I am concerned about the quality. The handle does not feel the sturdiest and the locks can be difficult to line up."
4,Arrived damaged.,"My copy of Metroid arrived damaged, with a large crack in the back. A large enough crack to not fit in the console. However, I can speak to the contents of the game and it is quite fun, great game. I hope to get an undamaged copy so that I can enjoy it in its original form."
2,The Mighty Maiden Bounty Hunter's First Run,"Although the first in a popular series, this isn't the best and is incomparable to Super Metroid. Granted the game is big, which means there is lots of exploring, there is one set of closely related problems that make Metroid less than steller, all related to attacking: Samus curls (or does nothing if you don't have the ball) when you press down so she cannot duck and shoot, disabling her from attacking small anemies on the ground until she has the ball-bomb or wave beam much later in the game. Additionally, Samus cannot shoot diagnally in any direction and she cannot shoot downwards. In my review of Super Mario 64, I said that one shouldn't only complain about what a game does NOT have; however, these features would be practically essential to the game.Buy only if you are a hardcore Metroid fan or you really want to play the game that started it all. Otherwise, look somewhere else."
3,Nice.,"This is a fun little old game, but can't compare to any of the others. Zero Mission was an excellent remake of this game."
5,Some serious wrestling,"The women who came into the ring to wrestle were dead serious and it shows. Some truly competitive matches. Tara larosa, Roxanne Modafferi,and Erica Montoya are among the some of the best and most exciting female wrestlers around. The skill and competition was great. And surprisly so is the sportsmanship. No grudges, no meanness. Just friendly competitors who are dead serious about their sport in the ring. Outside the ring good friends. A good video that displays great talent and lot more."
2,Very disappointed!,I was waiting for this release to come out with baited breath. Semele is one of my favorite handel works and I've owned the CD version with Battle and Horne with Nelson conducting. I can't tell you about this production because I found the singing to be so god-awful that I paid little attention to the staging. Bartoli is fair - although I found her sung English to be quite understandable. I feel that the other singers really ruined this performance for me. Very sorry that I bought it.
2,Two Stars for lead and conductor,"A wonderful Baroque opera made into a silly comedy... slap stick at times. I'm always surprised when great talents like Bartoli and Christie allow a director to make them out to be fools. Normally i would do not review performances since taste varies. My only reason for posting this comment is t caution prospective buyers... this is not a quality update, it is a farce. The singing does not excuse the low budget contrived production."
2,Weird Staging,"Handel: SemeleStaging is current vintage Eurotrash. Bartoli's mezzo lies too low for Semele and she strains to produce the required volume. Nikiteaun's voice also sorely lacks the strength needed for the role and her English pronunciation is atrocious. Tenor has a lovely voice which he produces without strain, both top and bottom, Orchestral playing excellent, and it is really better to listen to the sound track than to view tortuous sludge."
3,Pretty darn good,Purchased this lense a month ago. It is a bit heavy but overall it takes good pics. Glass is decent and speed is pretty good. It worked for me well in indoor and outdoor shooting conditions. For the money I think its a good buy.
5,great lens,"Great deal. It is a bit bulky, but it is not heavy at all. Very sharp when stopped down, but soft F2.8 has many applications. I am not using my SMC 21mm (limited) anymore, since this lens is sharper at 21mm setting and even more sharp at 17mm."
2,Caution: Compatiblity Claims Not Accurate,"I run Quicken 2000 Basic, and tried repeatedly to install this product on my WinMe machine. The installer refused to recognize the C:\QUICKENW directory, where quicken was clearly, correctly, and plainly installed. Tech support told me to try the download version, which I did, only to get the same results.I upgraded to Quickend 2002, installed into the same directory, and everything worked. Word to the wise: ensure you have a recent version of Quicken, and be careful when accepting transaction from your Palm into the desktop edition..."
1,"Was for a Mac, not a PC","The product I received was for a Mac computer, not a PC, so I couldn't use it. It didn't say anywhere in the product description that it was for a Mac."
1,This will NOT support Windows CE/Pocket PC... only Palm,"Landware Inc. seems to think that the only PDA in the world is the Palm OS. Hey here's news for you guys. there are millions of us out there with Ipaq's, HP's etc that use Windows CE and could really use a POCKET PC VERSION OF QUICKEN!They just don't seem to hear this plea. HELLO???? ANYBODY HOME?"
1,Budgets don't synchronize with desktop,"I wasn't really interested in entering transactions while away from home. I already download credit card transactions, which is far easier and less awkward than pulling out the Palm every time I pay for lunch.I wasn't sure whether this product supported budgets. Another customer said it didn't, but the marketing materials say that it supports budget tracking and ""works seamlessly with Quicken on your desktop.""The answer is, you can enter your budget limits on the Palm, but unlike transactions, they are not synchronized with the desktop. (Buried inside the user's manual is the note, ""Pocket Quicken Budget details are completely autonomous to the desktop and are not synchronized with Quicken."")"
2,Hassle,"My son was given this pool as a birthday gift. It looked like a lot of fun on the picture HOWEVER there are so many pieces to blow up which isn't even the problem..the rainbow and tree never stood up..just kept falling over. the wagon wheels fall off, the green ""garden patch"" (greeen thing with holes) takes up too mutch room and the clear plastic thing that has velcrow doesn't stand up. This pool doesnt hold very much water at all (came up to my two year olds ankles..not very refreshing on a sunny day) and is such a hassle to clean (you know how it is..kids in and out tracking dirt in) I like a hard pool where you can easily dump the water out and squirt it out. This thing is so bulky ...wouldnt recommend it...my son didnt care for it either."
3,This book was o.k. I'd like to give it 2 1/2 stars...,This was 1 of those few books I didn't care for very much. There were some GREAT moments but all in all I would give it 2 1/2 stars.
3,Mediocore game,The game is bland. The only reason I purchased it was the fact that it included the two brothers from Double Dragon.
3,Yuri Nosenko: KGB Could be Better,"Directed by Mick Jackson and starring Tommy Lee Jones as Steve Daley, Josef Sommer as James Angleton and Oleg Rudnik as Yuri Nosenko. Yuri Nosenko: KGB presents a well acted and interesting examination of the defection Yuri Nosenko, an intelligence officer with the Second Chief Directorate of the KGB. How due to the influence of Anatoli Golitsyn a paranoid KGB intelligence officer that defected to the United States in 1961, Nosenko was incarcerated for over three years. It does a good job of representing the conflict that is caused by Nosenko's defection and the damage that it did to the moral of the Central Intelligence Agency. Unfortunately, Yuri Nosenko:KGB fails to properly represent many of the facts of the case correctly, and simply misrepresents many others."
2,The Nosenko Case on Film,Great Film however in the end it seems to support Angleton's view if this case. Tommy Lee Jones is always good of coarse.
3,Not what I expected,"This wasn't what I was expecting. It was interesting, but slow. I was thinking it was going to be a thriller, but it was nothing more than a historical account of Yuri Nosenko's connection or non-connection with the JFK assassination."
4,Great device for use w/Cable Modem,"I purchased this device after i was told by Comcast that the only way to have two computers on cable modem was to purchase another ip @ (dollar amount)/month.Out of the box setup was pretty simple, and have not had any problems setting up firewall ports.Set theis up off my cable modem, and have a 8-port Switch of the router, networking my house works great with this device."
1,garbage,"I do not know why this thing got all those great ratings; unfortunately I bought this on the strength of those reviews. It seems great when you set it up, but you will find it has the most annoying habit of losing the connection VERY frequently. If you have an always on broadband connection, don't get this unless you just miss the old days of dialup and waiting to reconnect every time you want to get onto the Internet. It's certainly the cheapest thing out there; spend more and get something else! Furthermore, Linksys tech support is non-existent; they do not respond. I had decided to return this, only to find that my wife had just thrown away the box the day before and now I am stuck with it. I will wind up paying twice to replace this peice of trash. By the way, the next model up (BEFSR14-4port) has the same problem (from what I have read of other reviews). If you still want to take a chance, just save the box and the receipt!"
5,Does exactly what I expected and needed,"There isn't much to say about the product. It was easy to setup and worked perfectly the first time. I've had a lot of experience with Linksys products in the past, so I might be a little biased. I hooked it up with an 8-port Linksys hub and plugged in the computers and had a network in the time it took me to crimp the wires. Litteraly the only setup time is plugging everything in, unless you have to set up PPPoE for a DSL line (which is easy, as I have done that with this product)."
1,Nice product but ...,"Linksys has done a nice engineering job with the DSL/Cable Router. Very easy to configure, but it simply does not work with Media One.Suggest the Netgear RT311, which has more functionality, and worked right out of the box with Media One."
2,Why only ONE port?,"Linksys has great, easy to install and maintain products, but I highly recommend getting at least a 4-port router. It doesn't cost any more (not much anyway) and when you need it, it's there. I have the 4 port -- I use two of them, and one for a WiFi base station but I love having extras for guests with laptops. If for no other reason, think about when you have to upgrade your PC and transfer files.One port is the equivalent of having one telephone jack for your entire house."
5,The simplest NAT box ever.,If you want a quick and easy NAT solution this is it. Had the thing up and going in about 3 minutes. Connected it to the cable modem and my hub and away I went. The hardest part was releasing my previous IP address. I've tried all kinds of sofware solutions as well as Linux and this is it. Not quite as fun to set up as a Linux box but a heck of a lot quicker.
2,"Gamers go elsewhere, otherwise ok","For simple LAN use this is the perfect choice, great configuration options as far as DHCP and DMZ, however, what is not openly admitted is that this is not a true 100mbps router. Your uplink port, (where you dsl/cable modem) hooks up is limited to 10mbps, so regardless of the fact that your hub/switch is 100mbps, from internet to the pcs is 10mbps, translation, you just got slowed down from your normal capabilities. Especially if you have your cable modem tweaked to where it runs 8-10 times faster than normal, you will want to throw this in the trash first time you use internet/LAN communications for games."
1,Very unstable with RoadRunner cable modem and Linksys hub,"I had to return this Linksys router, because it was extremelly unstable: I had to press the reset button 5 - 10 times a day. I replaced it with a Netgear Router RT311 and it worked immediately for me. Be prepared that you may return the Linksys router. If you are obliged to reset it the fifth time, replace it with a Netgear immediately."
1,"Good Idea, but What a Mess it Made","Well, after hooking this thing up, spending 4 hours debugging with three computer systems on two different LANs, plus three different hubs ... I think 1) the router I bought is fried, 2) the hub I initially connected it to is fried. I'm not naive about these matters ... this should have been a simple operation but it was not and I'm still pondering how the hub got fried. It clearly works for some, but I got screwed. It will be returned. I haven't decided whether I'll try something else, or just keep paying the cable company $5/month for an extra IP address to avoid the hassles."
5,Excellent product for the price!,"Can't say enough about this product for the money. I chose the 1-port because I have a linksys switch and it has improved my internet connection and gameplay. Also, the firewall capabilities on this little gadget are the most important. No more Norton's firewall or blackace defender software that can crash or impede your system. Overall, this is a 5 star product for the money. Didn't need technical support, although I read that Linksys tech support is aweful, so be aware of that."
1,Junk,"This thing is a piece of garbage. I had one sitting in a drawer that I quit using a while back (replace with something better). I pulled it out the other day for a different application, and now I remember why it was in the drawer. The thing BARELY works, it locks up, linksys' support is a joke, their latest firmware still doesn't help. You'd think in 3 years they could fix the bugs.. the problem is they don't care..It's now in the garbage, as the cheap flimsy case isn't even useful as a door stop..."
4,"Excellent, once connected",Just got my DSL Router setup properly and running. It took about three calls to technical support to get the information that I needed to get it operational. The first couple of calls told me that I couldn't do what I was trying to do. I told them that it is being done so what's the problem. They finally concluded that I had something wrong with my box. After playing around and talking to a knowledgeable technician I am up and running and so is the other computer on the network. Now that I am running it is as was advertised. I knocked a star of the rating do to the multiple calls to technical support. I do laud them for being one of the few suppliers open 24/7.
5,Easy to configure. Functions better than advertised.,Unit was easy to configure. My network consisted of Win ME desktop & Win XP Laptop computers to Mindsprings DSL. The Win XP is also connected via wireless connection. Unit was placed into service within 15 minutes on both conputers after I finished reading the manual.
5,good deal,"This is the best online deal I could find on a tea that has a great reputation. I can't say how it compares to other brands because I have been brand loyal to Celestial Seasons. I can speak for value-if you need this much tea, it is a great deal! Be sure you have storage in your home for a purchase like this....my tea cabinet is not very large but I couldn't pass up the value! Enjoy. This tea is a step towards health!"
5,Celestial Chamomile Tea is a Wonderful drink.,Celestial Chamomile Tea is a wonderfully calming tea. It has a light flowery taste. You can also enhance its flavor by adding ginger or cinnamon.
4,More Meat Than Chicken Soup,"I am about to buy my 2nd, 3rd, and 4th copies of this book for friends and family.I enjoy reading those Chicken Soup/feel good books. Catch is that and more. Catch makes you think and it makes you feel. It is about real people with real faces. It has great human interest stories that you will never see in an internet chain letter. No sick kids needing postcards here.The book is set up into nice sized conversation so you can read a little at a time, but I found it very hard to put down."
5,Rippin' Tune,"I decided to purchase this after listening to the music while seeing the video online (randomly speaking). This track is one of those catchy house songs with a music candy kind of attitude. It will definatley make you move your body while saying to yourself this is a quality piece of work. While you move your hips and bob to the beats you'll wonder what those lyrics are trying to say. Somewhat dark and disturbing but we all have our moments of wanting to perform a drastic task even if it happens to be in our wildest dreams. Hmmm, makes yah wonder. Over all, if you happen to be a collector of imports, remixes and music that makes you move now and later - catch this release and add it to the shelf because you'll want to listen to this when in the mood to move or day dream."
4,the title says it all,"Miss Kittin has produced some very unique music over the years, and this track is much of the same. the lyrics are odd, yet interesting. The beat is mellow, yet upflifting. And to make it all complete, a very groovy synthesizer riff that will put shivers down your spine. I must say that ever since I heard a Miss Kittin album, it has changed my opinion of electroclash and the whole electronica genre. That is saying a lot, since I have been a hardcore clubber for years, and was once addicted to trance."
5,Keg,Got this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. He can't wait to get his keg going.
2,"Great Idea, But Not Well Made","I received this kit for Christmas (it had been on my wish list) and recently got around to installing it. Instructions were great, and installation of the parts were easy. Unfortunately, the CO2 regulator, a key component of the kit, turned out to be faulty and essentially failed to restrict the flow of CO2 to my keg. After swapping the regulator out with a replacement that I ordered from a different company than Beverage Factory, everything is working smoothly. I can't say enough about what a great idea a kit like this is, however I might suggest that there are other vendors that could likely send you a kit made of better components to do the job."
1,Truly bad,"Ms. London has been called the Queen of the serial killer groupies for her ""dating"" several killers, and this poorly written book seems to have been thrown together. Little real analysis, doesn't even have a bibliography."
2,A bibliography would help,"While most true crime does not bother with references, their scope is more limited than 'True Vampires'. I thought this could only benefit from a bibliography since it is international and has so many cases. Otherwise, it is pulpish and just shock material. There is little flow to the writing and little organization. It seems to digress to non-vampiric sensational serial killers, like Ted Bunday saying ""I feel like a vampire"". Again, this is not high end literature, but the points above distract from reading the book."
4,Bugskull - 'Phantasies And Senseitions' (Road Cone),"Overall, this title is about as good as their 'Distracted Snowflake, Vol. 2' effort {see my review}. Perhaps a bit too out-there for some, but if you're a fan of modern-day experimental psych, post rock (call it what you will) then you should hopefully get as much out of this CD as I did. Tunes that had me sitting up and take notice were the awesome droning piece - ""Recoder"", the minute-long oddity ""Big Ronnie"", their Elvis Costello cover ""Almost Blue"", the somewhat awkward ""Concrete Boots"" and the sort of Flying Saucer Attack-ish ""Death Valley '94"". Personnel: Sean Byrne (Count Five)-guitar, keyboards & vocals, Susie-bass, Aaron-guitar & clarinet, Mr. T. Experience-guitar & drums and James-violin & drums. Not a bad find."
5,Subtitle,"Hi,Does this have English subtitles?I would appreciate if someone let me know.I hope that it has English subtitles....."
4,Beer Mugs,Just alil bit to small. you can't put a whole can of beer within the cup. but close enough.
2,"Two stars, since only 2 mugs survived","The original manufacturers box containing the glasses was shipped within a much larger box full of ""popcorn"" Styrofoam. 2 of the glasses were broken. I could hear them rattling as I picked up the package on my doorstep, so they must have been broken prior to packaging by Amazon. The cardboard cross-piece that is supposed to separate them was not arranged properly, leaving the glasses loose to bang together.There is little point in my returning the broken glasses to the manufacturer, since the cost of return (~$10) is a significant fraction of the base price($15). emails to Libbey customer support were ignored. The 2 glasses that survived are OK."
2,Better if not damaged,"I ordered these beer steins as a gift for my (future) brother-in-law for Christmas. The steins were good, except that I was unable to give him two of them because one was cracked and the other had some sort of glass imperfection that looked bad. Being Christmastime and not having time to deal with the whole return-shipping nonsense, I just gave him the two good ones and threw the other two out. I was not pleased, to say the least. I don't know if the crack happened during shipping or what, but if the company is going to ship glass, they should pack their products well; and the imperfect one shouldn't even have been sent!"
3,"NOT ""for men and women"" as advertised!","I purchased this item thinking that it would fit me, since it says ""for men and women"" in the description, and I wear a pretty standard size, men's 10. I was wrong. The item I received is for Women's sizes 5-10. I gave it to my wife, which I guess got me some points so that's nice, but when I order something, I want to get exactly what's described, wouldn't you?"
4,Very good short intro to conflict,"The book starts out by providing a short but very good background to the events and causes leading to the first Boer-English War. Then the book goes about goes about and provides strategic and operations background setting up the battle (the English need to simultaneously relieve besieged garrisons while being contrained by London's orders not to engage in actual armed conflict - a real problem for the English commanders). Then the book closes, in its last third, in the actual battle itself. Discussion of armies, commanders and tactics are also included and are quite good considering the book is only 96 pages in length.The book's minor weakness is a lack of color plates on how the troops from both sides looked and a little discussion of the Colonial troop's weapons.All and all, if a reader has only about an hour to an hour and a half to dedicate to the subject this is the book to be read."
2,Not as great as you would think!,"I am a 3rd year medical student on my clinical rotations and bought this book mainly on the reviews here. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed in this book. It is a big book in the lange's tradition. One might think it is full of everything a medical student would need, diagnosis with differential, and treatment. Unfortunately, the explanation for disease is usually elementary at best. For a lay person this book would be great. However for a med student, doc, PA, or nurses etc this is just too basic. For instance if you were wondering what drugs cause pancreatitis, don't look here! It just says drugs can cause pancreatitis. This book is missing tons of details! You are far better off with the Washington manuel or Harrison's. Leave this one off your list, and save the money!"
4,A QUALITY COMPANION FOR THE MEDICALLY INCLINED,"Despite the fact that user-flexibility was not uppermost on the minds of its designers, the ""CMDT on CD-ROM"" is a quality companion for the medically inclined. Both medics and medical scientists may find this software irresistible. Detailed diagnostic and therapeutic descriptions, which spanned across hundreds of diseases and disorders were provided in a clear and sequential order.The contents of this CD-ROM are updated annually, and although it would be nice to own the most recent copy, one would not be lagging too faraway with any issue that is not more than five years off the pace."
2,very disappointing,"I bought this book hoping to find places to go on hikes with my daughter. The hikes are separated by distance from Sacramento and therefore is not easy to find a hike in a particular locale. For example, I live 45 minutes from Sacramento and the hikes in my backyard are in the same chapter as hikes that are 2 hours away."
4,great info combined with internet,I bought this book years ago before children to hike with my husband in the Sacramento area. I has been a great sorce of information for locations for nature hikes. I also use the internet with the book to make sure I have up to date information and have found out twice that the book was right and had better trail descriptions that then internet. Great book to find free fun hikes :)
5,great for appliance cords,"I love these things. I have a hard time finding them in the stores though. I use the small ones to clamp my appliance power cords into nice neat bundles for storage in between use. They are wonderful. So easy to use too. I use the big ones on larger applicances like room fans and such that don't have self cord storage. I have a habbit of over stressing them by making the cord bundles as small as possible and almost overstretching their capacity. Still they last a long time and the ones I have broken, I knew I was over doing it. I recently got some new appliances with out power cord storage and when I finally found these here, I bought three sets, so I will have plenty to spare."
3,Good effort,This Section 31 story is pretty routine stuff but the thing about the book that did impress me was author S.D. Perry's firm knowledge of Star Trek continuity. Eagle-eyed fans will notice elements of the book that tie in directly with episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager as well as various episodes of Classic Star Trek. The foreshadowing of McCoy's illness also gives the book a feeling that it is a Classic Star Trek episode placed firmly in the series's third season. I would have enjoyed a little more exploration of Section 31's activities in the 23rd century but all in all the book is a satisfying romp. A good effort that had the potential to be great.
5,Top notch original cast story,"Few Star Trek novels have done a better job capturing the mysterious and slightly icy mood of the original series, a la first season, than this one. Highest possible recommendation."
3,"""OK Is The Best I Can Give It""","The book deals with a secret experiment related to the TV episode where the Enterprise stole a Romulan cloaking device. It starts off very well as Kirk and co. must stop a runaway starship. And ending was also very exciting. But the middle of the book could have been better. Some parts were a little bit slow. Also there was no drama when Dr. McCoy comes down with a terminal disease. Please, you know he's not gonna die. I did like getting into the minds of the supporting characters like Uhura, Sulu and Chekov. Also some good scenes where Kirk's faith in Starfleet is really tested the more he uncovers about this illegal experiment. I just wish the author could have included more alien characters in the story. Like in Star Trek, all the crew members, all the starship captains and all the scientists are human. The Federation has over 600 planets. A little species variety, please."
3,A Good Start to a Cool Four Part Series Idea,"This is the first in a four book series. Each features one of the first four Star Trek television series in a continuing story about ""Section 31,"" a secret organization within Starfleet, using any means necessary to further the protection and goals of the United Federation of Planets. The first installment is about the characters of the Original Series including: Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc. It is an interesting start, but I look forward to diving into the next volume. Fans will appreciate this type of series.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel ""To Be Chosen"""
2,At least it didn't suck,"Not bad escapist fare. Every once in awhile, I pick up a Star Trek audio cassette and listen to it in the car. This was the first Star Trek book I'd actually read. The ""Section 31"" books intrigued me when I first saw them. I wish that there was more about Section 31 in this book, but it was good brain candy."
1,Pretty Bad,"I couldn't even finish this one, as much as the premise sounded good. The writing was awful, the plot didn't move, and the dialogue didn't ring true to the classic Trek characters. I'm sorry I wasted my money here."
3,"Could've been better, but good.","I was a little disappointed with how.......dumb Section 31 was in this story. They were beaten too easily to me it seemed.I came to the conclusion that Starfleet was still in a semi-early stage of life and Section 31 was also. In the day and time when Bashir and others tangle with them, Starfleet has ""grown up"" some and so has Section 31.Kirk, as always, is the Space Cowboy. Although the author trys to get across that the failed relationship of this book hurt him somewhat, he is and hopefully always will be the Space Cowboy.I thought the sub-plot with McCoy was useless and took up too much space in an otherwise good storyline. Bringing back the female Romulan Commander was a nice touch. I really like it when authors take a moment or situation from an episode or movie and use it.I've read 3 of the Section 31 books. I have to rank this one 3rd, but I hope that someday there will be more Section 31 books."
3,Section 31,It was an interesting story line but i think they really needed to go into alittle more detail. As I said the storyline itself was'nt bad. I'm looking forward to more.
5,"Crude, rude, and socially unacceptable!","I should hate Archer. He's an ovegrown frat boy with waaay too many one night stands. The humor is Sophomoric at best. But for some reason, it works. All the characters are distinct, eccentric, and hilarious. If you can suspend judgment for outrageous behavior, be prepared to fall on the floor laughing. Archer is a winner."
5,Great show,I picked this up for my husband for Christmas. He got me started on watching it and I love it.
5,YOU'RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR!!!,"Vulgar, sexy, shameless, hilarious, and extremely quotable. I forgot educational; if you pay attention to the intricacies and look up the things you don't understand, you'll be enlightened to a higher state of knowledge. Now that's an impressive combination of attributes for a TV show to have.The only flaw this show has is that it only runs 13 episodes per season."
5,excellent show,this show makes me laugh all the way through. great times had by all. i cant wait for the new season to be on fx.
4,Very Appealing To Men,"Sorry ladies, but this one is probably best suited for the boys. When this disc showed up at my door and I brought it inside, hubby all but ripped it out of my hands. Of course, he waited until the kids were fast asleep before watching it. I could here him laughing as I fell asleep too.I watched a little bit of it and thought it was really funny, smart, yet ghoulishly simple, crude humor. The suave main character reminds you a bit of James Bond, or his alternate twin in another universe. His wild life finds him ""getting lucky"" frequently turning into his luck running out.As I said before, this is going to appeal most to men. It is quite a romp though, so if you have an open enough mind, and are in the mood for something different to exercise your laugh muscles, then give it a go. After all, what have you got to lose?"
4,"Show = awesome, download = lame","My internet went down recently and so, like many 20somethings, I've been reduced to hanging out at wifi hotspots. Seasons 1 & 2 of Archer are HILARIOUS, -AMAAAZZIIINNNG-, even... but the downloads from amazon are SO SLOW it's completely ridiculous. 16 hours and I have 2 episodes completed. Do yourself a favor and either stream it directly from here or buy the dvd cause otherwise it's not worth it"
4,Every show just gets better/funnier!,"Funny, Clever and Witty. Every show...season just gets better. Fits my humor to a T! Its a must watch !"
4,Danger Zone,"Archer is a great show. Pretty crass and immature but such complex, hilarious humor. The first season, as a novelty, seemed more fantastic than the second when I was used to the wit and antics of the characters. My husband and I watch Archer whenever we need to relax. It's just an effing awesome show. Make sure you get Season 1 first. The special features are great, too."
5,Whats not to Like? Its Archer!,Just as hilarious as the first season. You will find yourself watching from start to finish and then finding a reason to watch again start to finish the next day! It is very reasonable priced for the amount of humor and content.
5,ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS !!!,THIS HAS TO BE THE FUNNIEST SHOW I HAVE EVER WATCHED! CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH SUPERIOR THE HD IS! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND WATCH IT HAHAHA
5,Keeps on getting better...,The continuing adventures of Archer just keep getting funnier and funnier. No doubt the major networks wish they could produce something this good. Shipping was fast and now I going to have to get Season 3...
4,very good,"Too bad this series is not yet on hulu, but hopefully one day it will be on hulu. Cant wait for season 3"
1,A small problem.,"I'm a big fan of Archer. I originally thought it would be a Stoner's delight, with nothing but the bland humour that a stereotypical pot-smoker would enjoy. In a sense, that's what Archer is, but it also manages to transcend simple one-punch jokes and becomes something wonderfully hilarious. It isn't the deepest television show in the world, but it's definitely one of the funniest. I'd recommend this show to anyone who is okay with ""dirty humour."" The art style takes a bit of getting used to though.The bad part? Well the seller I bought from ""ZIPIT."" The DVD arrived with a completely cracked case, and the DVD itself wouldn't play. They wouldn't even refund me the money spent. I won't ever by from them again. It was awful.-Nahaylem"
5,So funny,This show is non stop comedy. I constantly fear that I'm waking people up in the middle of the night with my sudden loud bursts of laughter.
1,These are NOT the brake shoes you are looking for.,"I ordered these for my Kawasaki w650, and waited more than an anxious week for them to arrive. When they did, I was curious about the large packaging. When I opened the box, I found brake shoes for drum brakes - not the disc brake shoes pictured. I will eventually need to replace my rear drum brake shoes, so I kept them, but I was very disappointed with this experience, and had to drive across town to a dealership and pay a premium to get new shoes for my front brake.I am now back on the road, but this kept me off the bike for a couple of weeks during some really nice weather; all thanks to the wrong product image, oh, and a lack of clear description."
4,Outstanding . . .,especially with all the personal stories and antectdotes by players from the golden era and how different it is today
1,T-2,"Like all the Terminator movies, T-2 is full of harsh obscenities which only detract from the movie. There's nothing funny or entertaining about a young boy or a woman (or anyone else for that matter) who continually curse like sailors and in this movie both the Hamilton and Furlong characters go way over the top with their vulgar language. I know we live in a ""so what"" society and it's ""just a movie"" but it's still a sad commentary on how far our society has been ghettoized and lost it's spiritual focus. If not for the foul language, T-2 would have been a good movie."
1,"this is a region-limited dvd, buyers beware!","I just bought this and discovered that, unlike most (i.e. approx. 90%) other blu-ray dvds, this is region limited. That means it will not play on my dvd player and so is useless. Why do corporations make restrictions like this, except merely to make more money by milking consumers? Total waste of money. Outrageous that this is not made clear."
4,"Loaded with drills, well illustrated, superior coach's guide","This is the best kep secret of coaches around the nation - and in Europe, too. As the first and best guide to combination - zone and man-to-man - defensive systems, the drills alone, if put to use, tend to improve a player's defensive skill. It's a good total system, too. It's complicated at times, but the book covers all the bases. This material really can be used all levels of the game. No padding."
1,Book of Has-Beens,"This book was full of interviews with ""yesterday's"" investment ""gurus."" Most of the so-called professionals in here haven't been able to beat the market in a long time. Skip this book. It's definitely not worth the money."
1,Surprising Errors,"I'm surprised at the errors in this book. For instance, in Chapter 5's description of value investing, the author defines ""Capitalization Rate,"" as what is really ""Market Capitalization,"" and then in the Cheat Sheet section says ""the higher the capitalization rate, the more risk involved.""It makes you wonder about any advice given in this book."
5,How To Santa Barbara,I have purchased 15-20 copies of this book for new arrivals to Santa Barbara. A humorous and accurate introduction to Santa Barbara.Bruce Arden
2,Eh?!?,"Well, this game wasn't the greatest...First off if you were picturing somthing like Ecco or Jaws, forget it. This game you get a side view of Shamu and there is this manatee that has a very annoying voice... Plus you get a list of ""Animal Behaviors"" but you can't perform any of the opes(about half)that make you push more than three buttons in a row. I would say save your money(luckily I got mine used for $5.00) and buy Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future or Jaws: Unleashed."
5,OUTSTANDING VALUE!!!!,This is a fantastic unit. We decided to enter the high-tech world and go for this Westinghouse LCD wide screen TV. Ultra sharp and ultra bright picture and SO light weight! Being able to enjoy DVD movies the way they were meant to be seen is fantastic. Also being able to use with our computer is such a great feature.Hope Westinghouse brings out a DVD Player soon. Will buy one as soon as they do! No disappointments. we are very happy!
5,Swallowed by Sweeder,"An amazing and short album by an amazing and short-lived band. At the forefront is a harmony between two very different voices (Jeff Carleton and Chiyoko Yoshida) that weave and play around each other like they'd been singing together forever. And what makes a song like ""Bells Lament"" so heartbreaking is this playfulness -- even though they're singing the same words it seems like they're saying two different things. When the female voice goes off on its own for a verse it's almost shockingly alone. Naked. Like a soliloquy. ""Bells Lament"" is one of those songs you want playing over the end credits of your life. Mellow, sad yet hopeful.Other stand-out tracks, like ""Moon"" and ""Thread and Wire,"" round out the mellowness. The world needs more music like this, it's a shame there was never a follow-up."
5,BUY THIS CD,"I was a fan of Dawson's Creek for years and during that time this breathtaking music would be the underlay for a scene or these soulful vocals would arise. I finally sat down one evening and wrote down a bunch of the songs that touched me. I was surprised to find that the majority of these songs were performed by none other than Mary Beth. I IMMEDIATELY started searching the internet and came across ""Goodnight Goodnight"" and ""A More Perfect World"". I purchased both on the spot and am definately not disappointed. You can smile, cry, be melancholy - it touches the core. It is beauty in song."
5,Inexpensive but effective,This product did exactly what it was supposed to do. On the second day in Canada we got alot of rain this pump made short work of it.
1,Two failures...dont do it,"It takes me many hours to refit and rewire a bilge pump in my boat. This is my SECOND Rule pump. The motor shaft breaks off after just a couple days. This pump is cheap , but I cannot afford it !"
3,Just Not Strong Enough,I replaced an old Mayfield 500 GPH pump with this 500 GPH Rule Pump. It does come close to having the power the old one did. I could tell a lot of difference in how much longer it took to pump water. Ended up ordering a bigger pump and not using this one at all. I guess I will have a back up if I ever need one. Would not order again.
2,All pumped up?,"500GPH is a bit of a stretch, even at a one-foot head pressure. Very little pressure the higher one goes up and away. Bought it for an emergency sump pump, but it does not have enough pressure to pump up and out of a cellar. Good for a small rise from the unit."
4,Pretty good pump,Pump seems to work pretty good so far but only time will tell. A little false advertising with it. Ad indicates pump is either automatic or manual but neglects to say other parts are needed to MAKE IT AUTOMATIC.
3,zumbz rapido,This DVD is fine...but be fore-warned;it's only 15 min. long!! I think that's a rip-off for $22.94(used)!!! I would never have purchased it if I had known. I am only hoping I can get a refund.
4,Good workout....,This is a good workout but you have to be watching the screen the whole time if you don't speak Spanish.... much of the cues and instruction are spoken in Spanish so you need to watch to see what they are doing. Probably would have gotten a different DVD had I realized this was the case.
2,Amateurish Instructor,"The English-speaking teacher sucks big time. She obviously didn't work out her full routine before starting the video. She has many stops and starts where the class (obviously professional dancers) couldn't follow her. The songs have long repetitions of the same movement. I will take this video when I travel because I can do the steps in a small amount of space, but I am disappointed in the level of instruction. I get much better instruction in my local class."
1,zumba rapido,I STRONGLY ADVISE WHOMEVER WANT TO ORDER ZUMBA TO BE REAL CAREFUL BECAUSE WITH ALL THE INFO U GIVE THEY TURN AROUND AND EMPTIED OUT MY BANK ACCOUNT.
4,Ralph,Merchandise received was what was advertised and in new condition. It was shipped and received on time.zumba Workout 4 DVDs Latin Dance Fitness Set
3,Its an average workout.,The workout is ok. I do enjoy other Zumba dvds and the Wii game better though. Some of the moves transition too quick for me. I would suggest if you can't keep up to just try your best and keep moving. It is a cardio workout and probably burns 500 to 700 calories because its moderate to hard in pace.
3,duplicates,These cds are fine with the exception of recieving a duplicate set which of course I have paid for twice. Iin trying to find out how I should return this duplicate I have found no information.
3,Fast,"I can dance ok and have taken jazz and tap, etc...so, i can follow choreography. However, this video lacks enough variety. I find i get bored with the choreography and scenery. So it is a three star for me. It is fast and i do get a workout but, just not exciting. I do not look forward to dancing like i had anticipated i would from Zumba. Perhaps i just need to go to the classes for this."
4,BELIEVE THE TITLE,THIS IS A GREAT WORKOUT 'IF YOU CAN KEEPUP AND TRANSITION QUICKLY'WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO BE FINISHED IN 15'?SOME OF OUR GROUP COULDN'T KEEP THEIR FOOTING AND BALANCE.
4,Zumba Rapido,"This is my first try at doing Zumba, so comparatively speaking I cannot say much. As for the workout, goes it was really good. It does not feel like you are doing much, yet at the end of each session your heartrate is up. After doing the arm routines the blood rushes to your hands a bit, the feeling I have only felt before when running a weed eater for a good amount of time. They did not go too fast for me, but I cannot do the hip movements to save my life, maybe with more practice. Cannot get worse right?"
1,Terrible purchase,"I have now owned this system for about two years. The first 18 months or so I encountered the issues referenced in other reviews: loud clicking noises when the CD player read CD's, remote stopped working after a few months, etc. Given that I use my system to provide background music in the office, I could live with these faults. During the last 2-3 months, however, my unit now stops midway through a CD and dies (at which point I have to power it down a few times before it will MAYBE read 2/3 of a CD again before dying). In sum, this is a terrible product."
2,cool looking gadget only...,"Everything would be great if I could play my own CD-R's that I recorded. It plays only (!) original Cd's. It's advertised as CD-R & RW player but in reality it's not. It reads disk at first but than starts to skip tracks like with scratched or dirty disk, even with newly recorded ones. I tried all my CD-R's - it's always the same story. And all Cd's are played well so the player it's not broken.If it won't change I'm going to return it."
1,On my third one....and it still doesn't work!,"This is genuinely the worst device. I am on my third one, having returned the first two after they didn't recognize that there were CDs (no matter what kind) in the unit. The second time I returned the unit, the manager saw me walking in the door, and didn't even ask me for a receipt or anything. It was like she knew what was coming. Obviously, these get returned a LOT. Now, my third one is doing the same thing. Says that there's no CD in the system even though I've tried everything. Even went out and bought a brand new CD to see if a new one would work.....nope, nothing. Well, it looks good! I don't know if I even have the energy to take it back to the store! Please, don't buy one of these! I don't want everyone else to go through this."
4,Mine works..........,I was reluctant to get a system after reading the reviews but I got mine yesterday and after tying every cd I could find (several cd-rs included) it worked fine. It read every cd I put in it. It's a beautiful system and the sound is exquisite.
1,"All looks, no quality","This CD player is terrible. The first 2 weeks it worked great. After that it started to skip on CDS that have never skipped in anything else and are not dirty or scratched. Also, the other reviewer mentioned that this does not play CD-R's or CD-RW's - it doesn't. It will show you the total tracks like everything is great and then when you press play, it skips, stops or just plain doesn't play. I will be returning mine as soon as possible. I cannot believe wasted almost 200 dollars on this thing - I will be returning to my Sony products. Do not buy this item!"
4,Good Deal,"We needed a very short (40"") shower hose and this seems to be the only one on the market. Fortunately, it is really metal, not the plastic hoses you see so much of these days. It is very flexible and hangs smoothly on the tile wall. The price was certainly reasonable. The color is bright-- brighter than brushed nickel, but not quite as bright and shiny as chrome. We are using it with brushed nickel fixtures and it works well enough."
2,A little boring study book.,"The word is God is alive and vibrant, I find these study books dull and hard to get through. I can't help but think the editors of these books are all the same people and approach this as strictly an acedemic exercise. I can't recommend this series of books if you want your participants to stay awake in class."
4,Great hardware unit; mediocre software included,"Still embarking on spooling off all the Hi-8 tapes I have, but I've been VERY satisfied with the Plextor unit so far. First thing I did was to spool one Hi-8 tape and then make a DVD, using the functionality of the bundled WinDVD Creator software. Good news: it worked, and a few hours after I started, I was watching the DVD I created, on my bedroom DVD player. Bad news: the software is full of minor and sometimes more than minor annoyances. It may be that I'm still climbing the learning curve with it, but I think it's just not very good. I'm looking into other solutions, such as Pinnacle, Adobe Premiere Elements, etc. Meanwhile, I keep spooling.I haven't yet tried the TV capture in any depth. It looked like it worked, but again, with some annoyances on the software side. Plextor could improve this offering vastly with the addition of some better bundled software."
1,Don't buy this!!! Incompatible with Vista,"They make an expensive product and it is permanently incompatible with the upcoming OS upgrade and their response to customers is essentially ""tough luck."" This box is now obsolete after hardly being used and not so much as an significant upgrade discount offered."
1,DO NOT BUY ---Never again Plextor,"This unit will never work with Vista based on the answer from their customer service. They sell you something over $200 without any insight for future with the motto that ""please stuck with our product for 20 years or till it dies without upgrading it to newer technology"". I wasted my money because it doesn't work under vista and it never will. If they are thoughtful and kind enough they should put a recall and replace this product with something that will work with future operating software and software upgrades. I do not think so, they will show respect to the people they have already ripped their honestly earned money. Such a shame that they do not have any future incentives. Never again plextor....:-("
3,Plextor Convert X PVR,"First of all do not let this review reflect on the seller I purchased this item from, they are the tops.Being a long time Plextor fan, and having used many of their various products in the past which have always been more than up to the task, I am sorry to report the Plextor ConvertX PVR PX TV402U - NA is a disappointment, as is the Bundled software. Slow time consuming and not worth the money. Would have been better off just buying a stand alone DVD Recorder to copy my 8mm family films of the kids. Does not do well on saving old VHS tapes to DVD either."
2,"Worked great for three months. Now, does not work at all.","I have not used the unit a lot, but when it worked, it worked very well. However, it no longer works at all. It lights up, it's all plugged in correctly. I've reinstalled the drivers two times. Checked it on two computers. It's done. So, this is very disappointing and I now have to figure out where and how to get it replaced. It's been handled gently, too, if you wonder. It's just sat on my desk the whole time I've had it. Just now, it's dead."
2,return policy not clear,"I had problems with this product, namely no sound when capturing and the image was smaller than in the original. But the biggest problem has been inderstanding the return policy. I am sure that when inquiring that a 90 day return was indicated (which I thought was nice) and the shipping labels will still print but amazons policy is 30 days, which had passed. I have inquired several times to try to verify this before investing even more money in return postage & insurance but get some kind of automated response with a link to print out a label. No answer to our actual question."
2,Incompatible with Vista + No Support,"I started using this product with XP, and for the most part it worked really well for recording on my laptop. But eventually my laptop died and I had to get a new one, which are now mostly only offer Vista. Unfortunately Plextor's drivers only work for XP, and I have been searching around and even more unfortunate Plextor hasn't offered any kind of hint of intent that they will release Vista drivers. So now I am basically stuck with a door stop."
5,Excellent buy,"This was a great bargin, I will purchase more great price and excellent quality of materails bags hold up perfectly"
3,Should have gotten the size 2 bags.,"I've used the T-sac bags before and they are fantastic for loose tea. But the size 1 is a little small when filling. So altho' they work fine, I wish I had gotten the next size up."
3,very nice,didnt like that they didnt close by themselves but otherwise i really liked them i am still using them today
3,Tea bags,"I prefer the kind of tea bag you can iron to seal it shut, but these will also be servicable. I grow and dry many herbs and like to package my own tea."
4,Useful,"This was a good purchase. No more leaf dregs in my tea and the perfect size for a single mug,"
4,Good product,"The only downside is that it's a little hard to get the loose tea into them without spilling; they're kind of narrow. Still, they're very good products and I use them almost every day."
3,"Could be better, but not bad as it is","I bought these tea bags in the medium size so I could brew loose tea, and also so I could use them as the spice-packet when making stews, etc.The size is ideal for large-leaf teas, such a chamomile, or coarse spices (such as dried chiles or bay leaves).Where there is opportunity for improvement is in the closure of the bag. There is a flap integrated in the bag, but contents leak out easily. I've resorted to using an office stapler to seal the flap, and that seems to do the trick. I wish these were available with a drawstring or something, so I wouldn't feel goofy stapling ingredients in the kitchen.But, overall, they are *very* sturdy bags, and they even withstand hours of simmering in the crock pot when slow cooking meats."
4,Double uses for me.,I use it for single servings of tea and coffee. Works very well. Got it very quickly after ordering. Best price of anywhere I looked.
2,Not exactly as advertised,"This product was suppose to be ten boxes of 100 teabags each. I received one cardboard box of a 1000 teabags. This makes it difficult to store in my cabinet as I cannot fit the whole box and I do not want to have them loose in my cabinet. I was planning on sending a couple of boxes to friends/relatives, but now that is also difficult. This company did a disservice to themselves since these friends and relatives would have seen a convenient product they would order for themselves.Don't get duped by the description."
2,Tea doesn't steep,"The bags don't seem to work, as water doesn't circulate through the bag, producing very weak tea. Overall, not very effective."
5,Best Tea Filters,"Have tried others - this is the best. This is a top quality tea filter - doesn't tear open like other brands - that is now difficult to find in the 12 cup #4 size. Being that the bag is a little bigger, when opened, any tiny tea bits fall into the bag from your measuring spoon instead of on to your counter top. I find this to be the most convenient size; realize that you can adjust the amount of tea and use this size bag for ANY size tea pot."
5,"If you like loose teas, this product will make you very happy!","You'll save time and those floaters in your teaby usnig these tea bags. Though I did not buy them from Amazon (none in stock), I bought 4 boxes of these filters. They're unbleached, which is great, and the tab that hangs on the side is very convenient when removing the bag (since there's no string...).I love this product and wish they sold it at my local grocery store!!"
3,"They are tea bags, they work...","They do their job, I just wish I could find ones that somehow tucked around themselves, because if you fold over the flap and seal it between your lid and your cup, it sits up too high and the tea won't continue to steep after you drink past the bag. I generally leave my bag in till the end of the cup. You could not fold it over before sealing it under the lid, but then you will be drinking your tea leaves. I think the balls & strainers are better items (plus more environmentally friendly) but I need something disposable when I travel."
4,Useful,These filters are really nice if you don't have a tea pot / strainer around or if you want to make 1 cup servings. The only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that the top of the filter is open. It's really not a big problem - I usually leave the top end dangling out of my tea cup and that works. I also found that you can poke a chopstick through the top of the tea bag and set that in your tea cup. Then the leaves never spill out.
4,Really FUN!,"I have 3 boys ages 10, 6 and 1...all of them think this is a NEAT toy!!! They got it for Christmas and have been having a lot of fun with it."
3,"OK,BUT...","IT WAS OK AS SOMETHING TO DO FOR MY CHILDREN, BUT THE PINS ARE A BIT LOUD AND THEN THE KIDS THROW THEM AT EACH OTHER OR PLAY BASEBALL, AND OUCH IT HURTS."
2,Fun for about 5 minutes...,"I bought this game for my 3 1/2 yr old based on all the great reviews. I have always based alot of the decision to purchase a certain toy on the reviews and usually they are right on track, but I disagree with most of them this time! This game DOES NOT hold the attention of either of my 2 chidren (6 and 3) nor does it keep the interest of me or my husband. This is the dumbest game. There is nothing to it. Also, the ball is fairly heavy and goes crashing into walls and baseboards, not to mention the unintentional potentional risk to fellow players. SKIP THIS GAME! This is the ONLY game I have purchased yet for my kids that I have been so disappointed in. If you want to bowl with your kids, spend the 20 bucks on a trip to the real bowling alley and bumper bowl!"
5,lots of fun,my 4 year old loves this game.It was a very hard game to find last year but it was well worth the search. he loves to keep trying to get all the pins down. even our dog likes to get in on the action.
3,Wouldn't have spent the money until they were a bit older,"I bought this toy for my twins last christmas when they were 2 1/2. They seemed to like setting up the pins and hearing them talk, but almost never took the time to actually ""bowl"" with it. Also the ball is hard plastic and has never broken anything but it sound terrible when my 1-yr-old throws it on the ceramic tile in the kitchen."
2,Not what I thought,My 4 yr old daughter wanted this soooo bad. Bought it for her and now she uses the pins to torchure the dogs. She lost intrest fast. Guess it's better for younger kids.
2,Skip it,"Although my daughter had a bean bag bunny bowling game, I bought this for her, thinking the electronic elements would add different (and fun) elements to the whole bowling experience. Nope. The bowling pins jiggle themselves when you sent them up, make a few smart aleck remarks and that's it. Give it a pass."
4,My daughter likes her silly pins,"My daughter received this silly pins game for her 2nd Christmas, form her Aunt.My daughter loved it,My 7 yr old son's birthday is right after Christmas so we used it for the kids at his birthday and they loved it.A funny,have fun game.You put the silly pins in their base and they talk and shake,each pin has a name.You put the wrong pin in their wrong spot they'll say something funny,(I'm smarter then that)."
2,Truly overrated,"I'd read so much about this toy. It is cute and attractive, but something my kids have shown no interest in. My kids (ages 4 1/2 and 3) liked it for about 5 minutes. They've never looked at it again, despite my subtle efforts from time to time. I would return this if I could."
5,Fun for the whole family!,"My little boy got to open this on Christmas Eve, his grandparents got it for him. My little boy was so shocked and excited when he saw the game! He had wanted this game for several months but I was'nt sure he'd like it as much as he wanted it but it was one of those games that I was wrong about- He loves it! I have to admit it is really a fun game. The bowling pens shake and talk to you as you play and they say funny, cute phrases. My little boy who is almost 4 can set the game up him self and play it without anyone else or if he wants we can play with him. I like games that he can understand and be able to play without having a second player all the time. It makes this game even more a good purchase because being an only child there is'nt many games that are like this. He loves this game and still plays it a lot even 3 1/2 months later. I would reccommend it!"
2,"20"" planer chatter problems","Most of the aspects of this planer are good except for ""chatter"". This has been a real problem for me with this planer. I can run something like a 1 1/2 inch oak cuting borad top and get NO ""chatter"" or dishing and then on the last pass get waves in the surface like a rough 2x12 at Home Depot. Powermatic has sent in a local expert that they hire and he did all the adjustments and declared all fine. When I ran a 7 foot board with less that 1/2 inch bow he then declared my problem as ""operator error"" for trying to run such bowed material. He has no answer as to why it would also do it on straigt material since he ""didn't see it happen"". My problem is you never know when it's going to show. Run a borad, smooth as glass, run again and it's full of ripples. This happens about 25% of the time. Plus, there was NO, NONE, NOTHIING AT ALL as to follow-up from Powermatic. Rest of my powermatic equipemnt has been GREAT. Get anything else but I'm very sorry I got this planer."
4,Quickly find what you look for,"Don't want to read long texts about how to do something? Rather want to look at pictures? Then this book is for you. It is a visual reference book, full with screenshots of the relevant dialogs and menus, in an easy to find things in and well organized book. If you quickly want to find that particular thing you suddenly do not remember how to do, find it here.I warmly recommend this book. It is a very good reference in combination with the Real World InDesign CS book. You first look in this one. Then, if you want to dig deeper, you read on in Real World InDesign CS."
5,Organized for Users,"With several InDesign texts close at hand, this is the one I find myself reaching for first. Cohen has an approachable style and the material is logically organized. The linkage of virtually every section of text to one or more illustrations gives the reader ""two kicks at every can."" Her VQG for CS2 InDesign will be my first purchase after upgrading."
2,Too Much [...] for the Beginner,"I'm having to learn this on the job, and there's too much crammed in here. There's nothing to tell me how to undo the side panels, and how do you draw just a round-corner box?! For people like me who aren't even familiar with Quark, there's just too much to take in. A better book would be Robert Shufflebotham's InDesign in Easy Steps, [...] Thumbing through that, I found it less crammed, more white space, less information. Less is better when you're first learning, then if you want more information, a book like Quick Start might serve you better."
2,"Ordered the hat pictured, received a different hat.","This hat looks great. If I received the hat I ordered I would have been satisfied. I received a regular hat the has ""Security"" in only two places. The third area is what sold me on this product. Very disappointing that it was missing. The material of the hat does not feel like cotton. Also the font is slightly different. Here is the description of the hat I ordered:*cotton*New!*100% Brushed Cotton Twill*Cap Color is Black - Raised Embroidery Lettering is White*Sandwich Brim with 1 PC Woven Label*Hook and Loop Fastener Closure with 1 pc Woven LavelThe hat I received has a tag indicating 100% POLYESTER. I believe that I was sent the standard baseball style hat instead of the ""Deluxe"" version."
4,Outstanding Head gear,"Comfortable, sturdy and recognizable. Letters are great! Supervisors have commented and approve. Recommended for wear during windy days, keeps head warm."
5,Awesome cap for the money,I had an outside gig in the winter and this cap is warm and very good quality. The lettering is embossed and stays looking good. Highly recommended.
1,I'm not a fan of this necklace,"The CZ is MUCH bigger than it looks in the picture. The effectis not so much the classy but still affordable that I was shootingfor, but more ""Look what I could have bought at Claire's for $6,but instead wasted $25 on."" I wasn't thrilled, to say the least.It's not the most horrible thing ever, but it's certainly notgreat either. It's just kind of tacky and cheap looking. Whichwas extremely disappointing. I think it's probably best for reallyyoung girls who really just want something that's kinda shiny, andwhose parents don't want to worry about letting them play with somethingthat has actual value."
3,It's not a new book!,"The ad said this book was new, but when I opened the box I discovered a much used book. Otherwise, the transaction went smoothly and I have enjoyed reading the book"
1,title misleading,"Advertised as a book about Jack Benny - his life, his career, his jokes - ""Sunday Nights at Seven"" turns out to focus to a far greater extent on the life of his spoiled daughter. Lounging in the lap of luxury during the '30's & '40's, Joan seems naively unaware that the rest of the world is suffering under the pressures of depression and war. She is given a brand new car at age 16, a driver's license with no test, a charge account at a boutique, an elaborate debutante party, etc. She is a self-admitted thief who deceives her parents, forges her mother's signature, steals her mother's clothes. But i finally must abandon the book, when she begins to repeatedly tear her mother's character to shreds, at one point even accusing her mother of trying to steal her boyfriend. She claims to venerate her father, but then proceeds to ""honor"" his memory by obliterating the reputation of the woman he adored. Perhaps her therapist should explore the Oedipus complex implications of her psyche?"
3,Poorly constructed.,"Jack Benny gets 5 stars -- always. But this book is not well put together; the narrative switches back and forth from Jack's first-person reminiscing to his daughter Joan's observations -- and it's often difficult to tell the switch has happened until you're several sentences or paragraphs into the new section. If Joan's comments had been put in italics or otherwise set apart, it would have been much better. Also, Joan occasionally went a bit too far in relating her own life story, forgetting that it was only where her memories shed light on Jack that they were appropriately included in this book. But all criticism aside -- any book that enables the reader to learn more about this comic giant is worth reading."
1,Bad design,"This is a bad design because the angles make it difficult to use. I never thought a product would invoke hatred, but this has. I hate it more than Obama, Congress, and Hillary Clinton."
3,average,"This tool has all you need for grill cleaning, however it is a bit small. If you like to clean your grill while the grates are still hot, this may not be the best solution for you because, based on the size and type of grill you have, your arm/hand gets too close to the grill and you can risk the possibility of burn. Overall, it does the job."
4,An enjoyable read...,"If you liked the OLD (70's vintage) copies of SOF, you'll love this book. Some interesting perspectives on various topics as well."
4,thank god i kept this book,"just like other reviewers, i got this book in the 80s. Just found it in my storage locker & started to read it again as i became interested in german snipers & ww2 on the german POV only.reading this book complements the awesome read of Ghost Force.although may not be applicable like getting hired as suggested by a texan, still it should give future SOFs globally what to do or not in renting out his or her services.or great in its right as getting hired in any field ie ask to get PAID."
2,The best Military Manual,Even though its old 1989 its still the best Military manual arund.America always neded and still needs a Foreign Legion not a Civil Militia. Mercenaries are the best soldiers.He should make a new Manual for the y2k.
4,A Collection of Articles,"This collection of articles collected and edited by Terrence Odlin, covers some of the pressing questions in grammar instruction today. The topic I was researching wasn't covered in this book, so it wasn't so helpful for me, but a few of the articles are worth checking out. In particular, I found the article on using databases for researching the structure of grammar in use to be very fascinating. If you're thinking of getting this, be sure to check to see if it contains any relevant articles for your research. If it does, go ahead and pick it up. If not, you might want to find this in the library instead."
2,This is a different band,"This is an EP by the Grand National from Buffalo, NY, not the Grand National from London, England. Amazon is selling the CDs together as if they were the same band, so be careful."
4,Kingsize talent,"The first thing that comes to mind when listening to this album is, ""Why in the heck aren't these guys signed yet?!""The band, although relatively young in the grand scheme of things, is actually made up of veterans of the music scene and it shines through in all it's glory throughout the CD.Two songs that stand out as definite single contenders are ""Space of you"" and ""Had it in my Head"". Both songs are great examples of their ability to write a radio-friendly tune without overdoing it.Don't be surprised to hear from them on a national level once the word gets out. Not at all what I would have expected in a freshman effort... and that's a good thing!"
2,"Lack Features, with problems","First Kodak makes you buy a Dock. extra 80 bucks.Although this camera does take good pictures when daylight is sufficient, this camera lacks features and with problems.No zoom. No timer. of course no video (which is ok)Here are some real problems:1. this camera makes DARK pictures when there is not ample light. Yes, flash is on. Regular 35mm (even those made by Kodak) cameras can do much better than that.2. Battery life is short. Do not trust the computer when it says battery life is good. You will run out after taking a few shots. If you gone to a day trip you must remember to turn it off everytime after you take a pic in order to last a few hours3.Upload from the dock sometimes give mysterious I/O errors. Frustrating. You may have to try a couple times."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"A terrible product for several reasons:- As others have said, the battery does not hold a charge.- It cannot be used outdoors; it over exposes every shot. Even when used indoors on a sunny day, the photos are a huge white glare.- Close-up photos are completely out of focus.This was one of the worst purchases I've ever made!"
1,Please don't waste your money............,Please don't waste your money on this camera.It uses a set of batteries about every 5-10 pictures. The docking station is a joke as it only works part of the time and has never charged the camera. It has been back to Kodak but they didn't do anything but put in new batteries and send it back. The few pictures that it does take are good ones but it is not worth the hassle and PLEASE don't depend on this camera to record an important event because I can bet you will be disappointed.
2,Trap! This camera uses a universally incompatible card!,"The pictures are excellent. In fact, they are among the best for 3-mega digicams. This is where the virtues of this camera end. The 3700 uses an SD or MMC card that is hard to find. Once you find them in some retail stores, they cost 3 times more than their CF counterparts. SD or MMC are smaller in size and are intended for miniaturization, yet this camera is bigger than Kodak 3900, an excellent camera that uses CF card. Therefore, this card format doesn't make any sense. Another disadvantage of this format is the maximum size for the SD card is 64 MB as compared with 512 MB for CF card. Since the internal memory allows me only about 7 pictures at the highest resolution, I tried to order a 64 MB SD card... The price in retail stores costs up to 5 times more. Now I have to use the pitiful internal memory and always carry a notebook computer wherever I go. The purchase turned out to be a disaster."
2,Disappointed,"The camera and software are easy to use but the quality of the camera is disappointing. It also doesn't include features that similarly priced cameras offer (e.g., self timer, optical zoom, etc.)The camera doumentation states that the docking station is ""optional"". However, if you want to recharge the lithium batteries, it definitely is required. The cost of the docking station makes the price higher than some other better quality cameras.Another annoyance is the LCD viewer. Once you press the button to take the photo, the LCD blacks out so you can't see what you're trying to shoot. Since there isn't an optical zoom, you have to use the viewfinder and can't tell if the ""zoomed"" shot is centered or not.I returned this camera and chose another product (Nikon CoolPix 775) for the same price that includes the docking station, several other helpful features and an MP3 feature as well."
4,Great Camera!,"This is a great little camera that gives quality photos. The only dislike I have is that there is a slight delay once you take the picture before it actually takes the shot. So, sometimes I have to shoot and reshoot to get the shot I want."
1,Don't Buy This Camera,"Maybe you can take two or three pictures before the battery is dead. The Camera Dock for this camera shows full charge but it still only takes two to three pictures. I use Kodak Rechargeable Ni-MH Battery Pack that came with camera. I replaced it, and it still doesn't work. I sent the camera back to Kodak and they ""fixed it"". Nothing has changed. I have tried other batteries, to no avail. The pictures aren't really that great, either. The camera and dock are dusty."
1,BUYER BEWARE.,"This product is junk. There is no useful purpose to this hunk o' crap. The pictures suck unless you are in BROAD daylight. The flash dosen't work, and even more pitiful, it makes the pictures DARKER when you have it on. The dock sucks- if it breaks (like it did for me) then you are screwed and cannot charge the camera. Additionally, the battery lasts for about 2 pictures and then it dies. If you turn on the LCD screen, you can probably only count on .5 pictures before it dies. This is the worst electronic product I have ever owned and I am sorry I ever bought a Kodak camera. I will never buy one again, nor will I buy another Kodak product, as I am severely disappointed with this one."
3,The DX3700 3.1-megapixel camera,"Extraordinarily basic camera. No optical zoom. No manual settings. No movie mode. In other words, the camera is literally a point-and-shoot camera...much like a typical entry-level 35mm film camera is.The DX3700 prints surprisingly good-looking images up to 5x7's, but 8x10's look a tad grainy...a shortcoming of Kodak's 3 megapixel CCD and lens quality (or lack thereof), I think. I've seen Olympus and Nikon 3 megapixel cameras produce noticeably sharper images.But if you don't need a zoom lens and only want to make 4"" prints, this camera is a very affordable and simple solution. It's also great to give to kids who want or need a simple digital camera."
2,Not a great camera with a inconsiderate company,"... I have upgraded to XP. However, the software doesn't work with XP. I tried to download new software but I had problems doing so. I wrote an email to Kodak but they wouldn't send me new software and didn't really care seeing that insead of fixing the problem they tried to sell me a newer camera. In addition the battery life keeps getting shorter as the camera gets older. It is also very diffucult to get a shot of something in action since the camera takes about 2 seconds to autofocus. I would reccomend a different for people serious about their photography. ..."
1,Do NOT buy this camera!,"We received this camera as a gift and like many other reviewers have had horrible experiences trying to get the batteries to charge. Customer service replaced and recharged the battery, but to no avail. It is sitting and gathering dust... Don't waste your money."
1,Horrible battery life offsets the benefits of good pictures.,"Like other reviewers, I too had trouble with battery life. Since we purchased the camera we have rarely been able to take more than 5 pictures at a time before the battery dies. My experiences with the docking station seem to indicate that the camera charging is a joke. I constantly have problems with the station and it does not seem to charge the battery at all.My parents purchased three separate cameras for my own family and my siblings' families. They never use the camera because of the battery life. I try to take two or three pictures of my newborn before the camera dies.In sum, this is an awful product. I am very happy with the few pictures it does take but the battery issue makes this product useless on long drives and is incredibly frustrating."
4,easyuse,"I think this camera if fun and easy for those of us who have kids and is not available to use the computer often enough to do the downloading and figuring out the software. My kids love me to use it, the 4 year old likes to see the pictures i take immediatly after. He is camera shy but allows me to use this so he can see,then he can just slip it on the camera dock and it is ready for the computer."
2,Trouble,Things started out alright but the LED screen burnt out and then the camera stoped transferring pictures to the docking station. So far the camera has had more down time then up time.
4,Nice for the price,"This is a nice camera for the price. 3.1MP and takes good pictures with some practice. Be sure you have a lot of light when taking indoor pics though. Also, there is no need at all for the docking station. The camera plugs right into any USB port and shows up as a drive on the computer. You can then just pull your images off without having to use Kodak's software. As far as recharging the batteries, I picked up some Ni-MH batteries and a portable charger ..., and I'm good to go. I'd also recommend getting an additional memory card."
2,Below my expections,This was not my first experience with a digital camera. After receiving the Kodak 3700 I thought it was defective due to the difficulty in turning it on. The main objection was the poor results with the flash in not too bright areas. Unless very close the picture was very dark. Just about all pictures had to be adjusted through a photo editing program. The delay in the focus and shutter operation left much to be desired. The final reason for returning the camera was the incompatibility with the latest Mac technology just released.When all returns are cleared I am going to opt for a Canon 110 or A20 or Nikon coolpix. Family members and friends have these and are very satisfied.
4,Nice for the price....,"I am extremely pleased with my purchase of the DX3700...even those it uses the MMC cards...I don't care really. I'm sure a higher MB cards will be coming out soon. Reading the other reviews, I realized how much people are upset about that aspect. But you must remember, every time something new comes out, it's this way. They will constantly improve the product, and the price WILL go down. Right now the highest MB card is the 64MB...which only allows about 75 pictures for a 3.1 MP camera...but hey. Who needs to take more than that? *unless you are on vacation and don't have access to a computer* (which I don't worry about).I didn't care about the optical zoom (which this model doesn't have) the model that did have it was [amt] more. Now with technology constantly changing...it's better to be on the edge. And in a few years, when I'm ready to upgrade...I won't feel like I'm losing so much money in an expensive piece of equipment. THis camera only cost me [amt]"
2,Memory Problem!,"Honggang Ma is exactly right. I saw this product in a store. Loved it's simplicity, 3.1 Mpixels for an incredible price. I thought: ""What's the catch?"" Then I asked about the type of memory. The store clerk had no idea. He climbed a ladder to find the box, and still we couldn't make heads or tails of the info. I used the web to find all sorts of reviews. Nothing specifically mentioned the memory. Then I found the previous review here at Amazon (GREAT reviews). This settles the issue for me. What do you do when on vacation and you simply MUST buy another mem card? With this camera, NOTHING! If you are not concerned about this issue, then definitely buy this camera. You will not find a higher resolution for the price. Be aware though, this is a ""point & click"" snapshot camera only."
3,dx3700 camara,"I bought a dx3700 camera for my girlfriend for Chrismas. She took about 30 pictures with and the battery died. I looked in the manual to see how to charge the batteries and it said to put it on the camera dock. The camera dock is sold seperately for [amt]. I was not happy. Also the batteries that came with were supposed to last an average of 350 pictures. It takes great pictures and I love the camera but to have to start looking around for a charger and new batteries a day after I use itis down right chincey. A camera that costs [amt] should include this stuff,and if they have to charge a little more for the camera to pay for the charger, fine. Not happy, thumbs down."
1,No a/c adapter made for camera,"After I bought this camera, I searched all over for the a/c adapter to save on batteries. Well they don't make one. I bought this to sell stuff on ebay, wanting to take alot of pictures at once. But the batteries soon die and I have to wait till they recharge. I had to go out and buy a battery recharger to have another set ready when one dies. The batteries last only a short time even being lithium. I wish I had taken it back. It also doesn't sit right on the dock and I have to keep fixing it and checking to be sure it is charging. It was easy to install and it does take very nice pictures, but all the other inconviences is not worth it."
1,Dont Buy this camera,"If you already bought it, congratulations, you have been fooled by Kodak to be included into their Beta testing on Digital products.Bad pictures, except for in good light, Bad battery, Zoom is useless, Memory too small. Pictures have a dark lines when taken in the dark.This product has the worst of All the features I have seen in Digital cameras. I sets an standard for other manufacturers on how low they can get in quality. Kodak should recall this product to keep thier reputation. If they dont somebody should force a recall."
3,"Good, but limited.","Great colors and glossy pages, but it focuses way too much on the Grant Morrison ""Big 7"" days and not enough about the history and many incarnations of the League."
5,Wonderful gift,Not only did I get this item in a timely fashion but I was so pleased with this product. It is exactly what I imagined. Thank you so much. I would definetly recommend this seller and products.
3,Middling comedy,"The Bottom Line:Another one of those ""comedy classics"" that's not actually a very funny or good movie, Revenge of the Nerds has occasional funny moments but it neither warrants its reputation as a memorable film nor your time and money; unless you're the type of person who finds the Police Academy series to be the zenith of modern comedy then stay away from this film.2.5/4"
1,The box was damaged,"When I received this dvd in the mail, the box was damaged. When I opened the dvd box the first time, the little thing that holds the dvd in the box was broken, the little plastic gripper pieces had broken off in shipping. And you guys wouldn't let me return it. Very disappointing."
3,"Still good, but find the VHS if you can","As good as I remember it. Pilot episode may be the worst thing made for TV that I have seen in my entire life, imagine, 'Saved by the Bell the college years' if 95% of the budget had been slashed. Many scenes in this film are cut short including Betty's full frontal. (I am shocked that no else one has noticed this). Still, overall, this episode is good but not the original."
5,enjoy,Loved this DVD from day one. All the characters are phenomenal. I have recommended this to many. Sequels not as good.
3,Suppliers and manufacturers listed in the back...,do they have websites? b29349@yahoo The tip about runnning an airbrush off a tire is great.
2,Bad design,"This would have been considered a bad design back a quarter century ago, and even though it is getting more difficult to find working paddles for the NES system I can not recommend this product. The paddle is uncomfortable to hold and difficult to use for a quick response."
3,Blast from the Past,"I remember this joystick as a kid, the power of being able to leave your finger on the button and cheat your way to victory (or playing a friend who had a regular controller). A couple of problems with this joystick lies within the design: it's pretty fragile, you drop it or fling across the room a couple of times you'll have to get it replaced, the D-Pad is circular, meaning when you intend to go forward the character my go diagonal, resulting in a cheap death. Overall, it's a solid product (which is more than I can say for alot of the crap nintendo has put out over the years)."
3,"Not what I expected, but functional.","The controller works, don't get me wrong, and the turbo function buttons are great, I even like the feel of the controller, it reminds me of a modern controller. Where this controller fails, is the mess of what they call a D-Pad. The stick in the center seems to serve no real purpose but to move around, you can still use the buttons on the outside to move, but honestly, it really messes with your quickness and agility. I suppose for some players, this controller might be awesome, I was really hoping it would be...but it just isn't useful when you are playing a game that requires quickness and reflexes."
3,It's okay. You may have better results.,"This product is okay. I'm able to use it once a day otherwise it dries out my skin too much. I'm not seeing the results I was expecting after about a month as far as clearing (adult) acne.I purchased this product because of the awesome rating and reviews, but I can't say I've seen much of a difference (yet?). It's worth a try for the price though."
5,tOtALLy catchy and FUN!,"I LOVE this CD! Move Your Feet is such a fantastic song! So upbeat, danceable, different, just overall good music! When I first heard it I became soo obsessed with that song! It's just soo catchy! I love danceable music that has just great beats and this song is it! Buy it!!!"
1,Very Embarassing,This is one of the worst songs I've heard in my life. With an anoyying chorus and bad music I gotta say shame on you Junior Senior. Buy their second single RYTHM BANDITS which is so much better than this cheap song just there to make money. what a waste.
4,Child Artist Nurtured,"I read this as a child poet; I'm so sad to find it out of print. Emma is a child painter, in love with a tree, nightly mixing paint to try to capture the color of the night sky. While her moher is on a trip, Emma's grandmother comes to take care of her, and the two begin a beautiful friendship, which fosters Emma's identity as an artist. In league with Harriet the Spy, I, Trissy, and the Anastasia boks. Pray it comes back into print. Kids & adults will love this book."
3,"Worth a read, but not paying dearly for","Decent story but does not come close to the Infinity Gauntlet, The Rebirth of Thanos, or Annihilation. It's a novelty read with appearances from StarLord and the Kyln."
3,Mediocre story not even worth cover price.,"This is by no means a ""must have"" Thanos story. It doesn't have anything to do with Annihilation. It's a throw away Thanos story, but worth a read if you are a Thanos completest. As non-Starlin Thanos stories go, it's much better than the Thanos story from THOR in 2000 by Jurgens and Romita Jr.This trade reprints Thanos issues 7-12. I found the single issues of this story in bargin bins at comic shows; you can too. As a set, it'll cost a little more, but you should only spend somewhere between $6-$12. It's barely worth cover price, let alone today's rates ($35 used to $66 new!?! Ack!). Don't waste your money; there are literally hundreds of other cosmic Marvel and superhero trade paperbacks you can read with better stories at a better value."
4,better than expected,"Like the previous customer, It's great for those urgent email messages. However I don't have a problem with the phone component. I love the keypad. I haven't had any problems with the reception. Might be area specific. Dropped calls rarely have anything to do with the phone, but rather the carrier.I have had one problem with the sim card. This was due to the fact that with the blackberry I had to change the sim card so that I would be on the cingular network and not the AT&T; network.I am enjoying the blackberry and I love the fact that I can set it up to turn off and on automatically.I hear the 8700 is better on the web browsing, but I like the sexiness of this phone."
1,Blackberry 7100,Reception is horrible... Very hard to hear a conversation unless you have the bluetooth...People never hear me as well so the mic must be bad as well..Switched it 3 times and still the same... Drops calls and very bad reception.Not recommended...
3,"Great (Addictive) for E-Mail, Loust Phone","RIM Blackberry has still not quite figured out how to make a cell phone. Don't get me wrong...The e-mail functionality is incredible. However, the phone quality is poor -- bad reception, dropped calls and weak design.It is so bad, that I do not think you can use the 7100 as a primary phone in the U.S.I am keeping it for data, but without the monthly voice plan. I am ordering another phone for voice.Would that it were were not necessary to do so..."
1,No stars for customer service and returns,"Word to the wise! Don't make a miskate because the return policy between Cingular Wireless and Amazon.com is awful. I have been trying to resolve a return for weeks. In the interim, I received a bill ($149.00) from Cingular Wireless for a service I never used on a phone I don't have and never used."
2,Not The Phone From The Picture,"When I saw this phone on Amazon, I got really exited because it was kinda like a blast-from-the-past for me so, I confidently placed the order thinking i was gonna get the phone that was illustrated. When I opened up the package, I was surprised to see this pretty beat up phone (even though I was promised one in great condition) that looked nothing like the phone from my teen years. The only reason this guy got two stars was because the shipping was fast and got to my house earlier than expected. In conclusion, if you are looking for the phone in the picture I would look somewhere else but, if you are looking for fast shipping this is your guy."
5,A F desert,"Best fighting knife ever. Steath is practical, does no scratches on the blade. Steath is only one color, no camo as you cane see pics on internet. Same quality as the ordinary model, only difference is sand color. Arrived in time. Another great knife, another great buy from Amazon."
1,a fraud on the public!,"I have been a collector of military type blades for many years, and this knife has been the biggest disappointment of ALL my purchases. The first time I used it under any great pressure, the ""virtually indestructable"" plastic grip broke! Next, the poorly cast finger guards broke off! The blade, while heavy and sturdy, is difficult to keep a good edge up! All hype and far too expensive for what you are getting!"
1,"NOT WORTH THE VIEW, EVEN FOR POE FANS","It seems some of Poe's classics should not be made into film. In this tale a family gets together for the reading of a will at a house that appears to be haunted by the ghost of Rebecca, whose oval portrait appears on the wall. The haunting effects are poor, as in turning a camera on/off poor, something that dates from the 1920's. We do find out about Rebecca in a flashback which consumes much of the film.It has a low budget Mexican feel to it. The acting wasn't great either.Parental guide: No f-bombs, nudity, or sex between two living people."
5,Great product,"I love this product, but kind of curious why there is a remote. But overall a great buy. I am very satisfied."
1,Doesn't play all MP3's,This wouldn't play all my MP3's. Even ones that I ripped using iTunes it wouldn't play. I couldn't figure out why so I had to return it.
3,maybe i'm an idiot,"Yeah, maybe. But I couldn't get this to play my mp3s either. I burned them with my ibook, and cds that I'd burned and have been able to play on other cd players just wouldn't work on this one.I'm probably doing something wrong... but I'm usually not THAT incompetent with technology.Anyway, other than that, it's great if you just want to buy cds to play."
5,The best mp3 player ever so far,"I just bought one all I can say is WOW!!!! This thing rules it is amazingly light, and has amazing sound quality even at 64k. It's only 53 dollars and u can put 490 songs on one cd and organize them into groups, wow thats about 5 times more then ipod shuffle can have and the ipod shuffle doesnt even have an lcd screen that displays information. Plus just one battery lasts 41 hours. Also this thing will never skip I have shook it held it upside down but it will not skip. What are you waiting for go buy one of these now!!"
5,Best Edenton Resource Book,This book is the most wonderful resource for documentation of dwellings in Edenton and is a great source of informaton for persons visiting Edenton and those restoring homes in Edenton. Now I know how my new Edenton purchase looked 100 years ago!
3,Nothing new here. Only good if you own nothing from Domingo on EMI,"EMI did a really cheap job with this boxset. They only gathered previously released opera boxsets plus a CD of operetta arias (also previously released) and put them all as is in this cheap cardboard boxset. NOTHING new here, not even a booklet to commemorate the 30th anniversary.This being said, these recordings are great and among the best recorded versions. But don't buy this boxset if you already own these recordings or most of them. If you just miss some of them, buy them individually. Some of them (Don Carlo and Tosca) have been re-released and remastered using the latest technology."
3,good story line -but child porn video,"a movie that had a great story line of realistic ,world that we live in ,and what is happening to many a young persons,in which the world we live in ,but it goes way to far with the complete frontal nudity of CHILDREN and sexual contents"
2,"NOT GOOD IMAGE, NOT GOOD LANGUAGE",Where is the original version for this beautiful film? It is necessary to make a new DVD in FRENCH but with a high and good quality of image.I'm sure that a lot of people was waiting for this DVD from a long time ago and what happen now ?. It isn't a very good product.A little bit of a sexual scene was cut nearly the end of the story. Why ?.
1,Worst picture quality ever,This dvd wins the award for the worst picture quality transfer to DVD. It is almost unwatachable. It is like watching the movie at a drive-in through a blizard.
3,Pretty Decent Story,"I first saw this film on Cinemax some 20+ years ago. I had seen the coffee table and was impressed with David Hamiltons work. I can't say that I'm real big on the soft focus technique though. Actually, the first work I had seen By David Hamilton was ""Sisters"". It was a coffee table book and was very good. This movie has a good storyline. I have seen this on DVD, but not this label. It was on the New Star label, and I wasn't real impressed with the transfer. The cable TV version I saw had some additional footage that was left out of the DVD version ( NEW Star) I saw. The Version I saw also had some interesting outtakes that were not in the movie during the closing credits, primarily scenes that were in the movie, but shot from a different angle. Charlie S."
1,a film a pedophilia would love,"I got this film because of the supposed lesbian content but instead felt like calling the police and reporting this underage sex film. The 'girl' in this film looks about 14, and has several soft porn sex scenes with much older men and women. Even though the actress was 25 when she made this film, she looks about 14. I wanted to give this film a big zero but Amazon wouldn't let me. Other stuff -- the movie is dubbed not subtitled. The video quality of the film is fuzzy and very poor. Several times the movie froze up. There was no reason to make this film but to watch a seemingly young, underage girl have sex with a variety of older men and women. If you dig that, than this is the DVD for you!"
3,"The film tries to be honest in portraying Bilitis' coming of age, but often becomes pretentious...","Bilitis (Patti d'Arbanville) attends an all-girl school that is about to break for summer... Once on vacation, Bilitis comes to hold with her developing sexuality and strikes up a romantic liaison with a local boy... A secondary romance concerns Bilitis' female guardian and her new husband...The treatment of sensuality is soft and beautiful, which is in keeping with Hamilton's style of photography... At the beginning of the film, we see the sweet, sensual bodies of the schoolgirls exuberantly bathing in a mountain lake...When Bilitis is finally seduced, it is exaggerated romance, heavily diffused, implying rather than showing their coupling... The lovemaking between the married couple is equally stylized, but more steamy..."
3,Bilittlest,"One doesn't like to admit one watches a serious film for the T&A, but Pierre Louys didn't provide much of a story to hang ones hat on. My tape looks like it was shot through a filter to give it an effervescent artsy look. It certainly was filmed with art in mind and it is a worthwhile addition. Patti D'Arbanville plays an adolescent convincingly but I think she is a little older than she looks. At any rate it is clear from her nude shots that this small upstanding actress will have happy babies. The music of Francis Lai is outstanding. It is well worth listening to on its own account."
1,What were they thinking,"Unfortunately although I do own this game I feel it was nearly a deathblow to the entire series. Zelda games are a classic the first game with saving capacity. It truly was a ground-breaking game because in stead have your old school side scrolling games you had freedom of movement, different items to utilize, and puzzling dungeons to master. I feel whoever cam up with idea for a side scrolling zelda game owes us hard-core Zelda fans an apology."
1,What is this?!?,"I am a huge zelda fan, I have beaten every game in the series except for this one. I have tried multiple times and can not play for more than an hour. This is bar-none the worst game I have ever played...for any console...ever. I love the NES and the Zelda series is the best ever, but who came up with this game? The bottom line is, this game is nothing like the rest of the series...so you must judge it for what it is...which is trash. I hate this game."
3,"The game works great, just not crazy about the game itself.","The game works great..but as far as the game itself, to me it is not the best Zelda..then again, for a regular nintendo, it's not that bad either."
4,"Sequel to ""A Link to the Past""","""Zelda II: the adventures of Link"" is possibly the best one that ever hit the NES. With ""Zelda 3""(which is actually the prequel), and the other 2 ""Z"" games which are the sequels.I wasn't TOO much into ""The Legend of Zelda"", which came to the NES in 1987, but this one got me quite impressed. The puzzles are great, the weapons,items etc. are awesome, and the bosses have an excellent challenge.This one may be for more of the advanced players though, due to that its much harder than any of the others in the series. Be sure to also check out: ""Ocarina of Time"" on N64.(another classic ""Zelda"" game.)"
5,Simpsons on DVD will rule,"To the person who mentioned them possibly putting out all the THOH on DVD, they are apparently releasing Simpsons DVD's starting in February. They are going to do full seasons, with lots of extras. Apparently similar to the ""X-Files"" DVD's (which I've never seen.)"
3,Not the complete THOH set,"Yes, unfortunately this set has only two of the THOH series, not even the great ones. But there are some great occult-y shows like Bart Sells His Soul and Cape Feare. I wish that there was one whole set of the THOH episodes. Perhaps on DVD?"
2,Misleading.,"The Simpsons is the hippest, funniest animated series, bar-none, but I have a couple of complaints about this set. First, why only two episodes per tape? At 22 minutes per show, why not put three or four on a tape? Second, why call it the Treehouse of Horrors Gift Set if only two out of the six episodes included are Treehouse of Horrors? That seems terribly misleading to me, and the Amazon.com reviewer did well to advise the customers of this fact.If this were actually a set of Treehouse of Horror eps I-IX, three eps per tape, I would buy it in a second. As it stands, I will not buy this set, and can't recommend it, as much as I love the Simpsons."
1,Live performance by a second rate no name cast,"There are so many GOOD versions of OKLAHOMA! available that only musical theatre collectors who want EVERY version of the score would want this. The cast is very ordinary... your local college production was probably done with much more energy. The live recoding just means there is audience noise throughout the songs and applause (not very stronng applause) after each cut. Stick with the original 1943 cast, the well sung movie sountrack, or the inventive 1998 London revival with Hugh Jackman."
1,"Second rate cast, horrible production","I'm not sure why this CD is on the market. I first bought this CD not knowing about the multiple cast recordings available on the market, and I was sorely disappointed. The voices are mediocre, the accents are lousy and now this CD has just been collecting dust on my shelf for years. I think any recording other than this one would be recommended."
5,Fun and safe,"considering all the adult content seeping into video games these days, this game is good clean fun - lots of humorous Shrek antics and lots of fun for kids to battle with their friends - not too hard for parents to pick up either. tons of characters to unlock -"
3,A wrestling game with a different theme,"Shrek Superslam is a pretty decent game, for a wrestling game. (Note: I am not a fan of wrestling games, or sports games in general) It's much more entertaining than most wrestling games, each character has it's signature move and they are all hilarious to watch. The story mode features little mini-stories that set up a fight between two characters, and so far they've all been very funny. (haven't gotten far, yet) The training mode was a huge help in learning the combos. My biggest complaint is with the four player mode. The camera moves in weird ways, and it's very difficult to track where your character is in relation to the other characters.All in all, if you have young kids that like wrestling games, this would probably be a good purchase. Otherwise, I think you can do much better."
2,Don't watch this movie,"The Guns of August is an absolutely boring documentary. It is very slow paced with no excitement, even though the subject is war. Actual footage from the trenches is used it's the only good part in the film. The narrator's piece has no emotion. I don't recommed this movie because it is boring and flat."
3,The Guns of August is a highly informative documentary.,"The Guns of August is a boring documentary of WW1. It is educational if you want to learn about WW1 but the movie seems to be biased about Britain and Germany. In this movie, Germany is portrayed as the ""bad guy"" as while the British are the ""good guys"". The movie includes actual footage from the trenches, which I found amazing, but The Guns of August is slow paced. I recommend it only if you want to put your grandmother asleep or are not easily bored."
2,It was not what I expected.,"I expected a treatise on rose care using the usual procedures, especially for different climates. This simply was this man's recipes for fertilizing, spraying, and planting roses using home products."
4,...,"Thomas Aquinas' treatment of the 'literal interpretation' of Job appears to be his way of avoiding ground he believed already covered by Pope Gregory in Gregory's Moralia on Job that was seen as a spiritual interpretation. Thus Aquinas decides to approach this with literal interpretation in mind.Thomas' approach is unique -at least to me- he casts the book of Job in a sort of philosophic dialogue. Job in contradistinction to his friends is of course seen as in the right and his friends are in the wrong. Thomas puts Job's statements on a high plateau in this commentary, so high in fact that he presents God's answer to Job at the end as agreeing wholly with Job but merely disapproving with how Job said what he said."
3,A slow clunky version of Contra with great graphics and quirky enemies,"This is an okay game in the Contra fashion. Its a side scrolling arcade shooter with multiple paths to the end of each mission boss. Its challenging, slow, quirky and funny. Such as you can be turned into a zombie or you get a helper monkey with a gun. Its slower than contra and quite honestly its more challenging than fun. There are 4 characters to chose from, but there doesn't seem to be any play differences. The animation and graphics are great, but its just a slower version of Contra. It would be better if fun > gameplay."
4,this is the BEST!!!!,I love it!!! its the best it mixes old school 2d graphics with awesome gameplay. And its sortof challenging so it makes it an all around AWESOME game.....I RATE IT A FIVE STAR
1,wow,"i must be getting over the 2d platform genre or something, cause this game is just plain boring."
2,Not My Thing,"I'm not sure what the big deal is about this game. I've read numerous positive reviews on Amazon and GameSpot about Metal Slug 3, but I don't understand the appeal. It looks and feels like an old coin-op game from the 80's... which is great if you are into that kind of thing. But for me, I've lived through that era and enjoy the advances in technology when paired with games.In summary, Metal Slug 3 felt like a rip-off. Why? Because the game does not take advantage of the Xbox technology. It's just a simple shooting game that scrolls from right to left and that's all. I was annoyed that when your character dies, you need to start the level over from the very beginning.I would recommend Armed & Dangerous over Metal Slug 3 if you are looking for a fun shooting game that takes advantage of the Xbox technology. But if you're still curious about Metal Slug 3, I suggest renting the game first."
4,Shoot-em-up!,"I have always played Metal Slug in the arcades and I played this for X-box and I cried! This game is the best! The graphics, the effects, the guns. They are very much like the arcades. I love this game! BUY IT NOW... and I realy mean NOW!"
4,Great build,Great designed furniture. Very comfy. Color of cushions are a bit off. Definitely have that peachy tinge to them. I went ahead and ordered cushions from Restoration Hardware that are on sale right now. Stinson style. Almost identical measurements. I would have given it a 5 except for the cushions are not top notch. I ordered the moving chairs by Strathwood and those cushions are much better and better color.
3,"Second time around, just okay.","Our first sofa arrived with a badly bent frame. Amazon customer service promptly had it picked up and sent another, which arrived in a few days.The cushions are lighter than pictured, so we heartily second the scotchguarding another reviewer mentioned. Though the sofa seems sturdy enough for sedate sitting, it's obviously nothing like the quality of the more expensive sets. We don't have young children or large pets, nor is the furniture open to the elements. Any of those things would have made me send it back immediately, as I don't think it would last. Bottom line: If you don't expect it to be of the highest quality, and you police your order carefully for dents and scratches, you should be okay with this sofa."
3,Why White?,"I absolutely love my outdoor sofa but why oh why do the cushions have to be white? They are actually a neutral cream and very pretty ---at first... Within 3-4 days they were filthy. When I saw the sofa online I thought the cushions were vinyl and figured great easy clean up, but they were not they are fabric. Yes I do have animals and kids so I am going to make new covers for them. Still this sofa is a good piece of furniture for the price."
4,2 seater lounge chair,"I purchased this lounge chair along with two chairs, a side table and coffee table after looking online and in catalogs at Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, Frontgate and Ballard Designs for a patio set. There were several reviews, most stating this set was worth purchasing. I made sure that I checked out the entire set when delivered to make sure it was well made, as a few reviewers had complained that the welding was bad, and am happy to say that my set was in great condition. The cushions are not the best quality so I highly recommend you use a fabric protector to help keep them clean. If taken care of properly, I think they will last a few seasons before needing to be replaced. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this set to others looking for an attractive, well made patio set in a price range that doesn't break the bank."
5,Very please with quality,"This is the first time that I've bought something online where I've had to rely on the reviews of others. Wasn't sure what I was getting into. But I have to say that I am completely surprised and satisfied with the quality! I ended up buy the loveseat as well as the lounge chairs, ottoman, the dining table and 6 chairs. I have a whole new outdoor 'room' for a fraction of the price of buying from Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn or C&B. I looked at the furniture for all of those and feel that the quality of this is just as good. Yes I agree that the cushions are not really that great fabric wise, but you can buy new cushions with the savings"
1,Doesn't last,"We purchased a whole set of this furniture a year ago. It looks nice at first but is poorly made. A leg on the the couch broke on the first day. Amazon was great about a replacement but a year later the paint is falling off, the arms on two of the matching chairs cracked and the cushions look terrible. We'll have to buy a whole new set of furniture this spring and throw this junk away."
1,Cushions are terrible quality - I want my money back!!!,"The sofa is beutiful when you get it out of the box but in less than 30 days they look like they are 2 years old! I covered/protected it since it arrived and given they are outdoor pieces, this should not happen! I would like my money back!"
1,Don't Bother!,"We tried twice to get this sofa - both were returned damaged. It was a real shame - the cushions were well made, with zip off covers for washing - nice deep seats, but in both cases, the arm units had been damaged and the weld broken. I would not try for a third sofa. Amazon was very good about returning the sofa and couldn't have made it easier, but what a disappointment in the sofa! In all fairness, the company that made the sofa did a good job, obviously either the person loading the sofa into the truck, or the delivery company dropped or somehow rammed the sofa arms to cause the damage."
1,piece of junk,"Despite the other positive reviews on this sofa, it is poorly made. Although it looks nice and like more expensive outside furniture, mine broke in less than a week. The metal just split on one of the legs. Just for the record, I weigh 150 lbs, so it wasn't an overloading issue. Anyway, amazon was great about returning the item, so that's a plus. I've been beginning to learn that you get what you pay for, so I just went out and bought a sofa from pottery barn. Couldn't be happier with it."
4,Great frame cushions not so great,This is a great piece of lounging patio furniture. It sits low and deep. I agree with the other reviewers that the frame is not black and the cushions are not white but off white. The cushions are okay but I will probably replace them with something else. But the sofa frame is really what I was looking for - a comfortable piece of furniture for me and my cats to hang out and chill.
3,"Cushions, Really?","There really is such a standard as truth in advertising. Just know if you order this product, it will arrive quickly, in excellent condition, will appear substantial and of high quality ... and the cushions will be ... a problem. Someone else described them as a light peachy yellow color. That's an excellent description. I will note that that is a color that does not exist on any color palette, so it matches nothing. Not umbrellas, not accent pillows. The biggest problem for me is that the pictures on amazon.com completely misrepresent the color."
5,Music to feel jazzed up about life by,"What I love about Juan Manuel's Liberation is that it just makes you feel good. When you listen to it, you get present to just how great life really is---ALL OF IT. The music is lively,hot and passionate. The artist gives himself to you in his music, and it makes you want to return the favor by loving life and everyone in it. Pretty cool, wouldn't you say?"
5,Perfect music,"As far as I'm concerned, this is perfect music. I could listen to it all day. It is infectiously upbeat at times and deeply spiritual at times. It is accessible without being insipid and just makes sense when you listen. Music like this is a testament to the creative benefit of a diversity of influences.The sound quality is excellent as well, very crisp."
5,Best filter around,"Performance on my 3.2 Isuzu boosted with this air filter. Great part, should be the first step on performing your 4x4."
4,I wish I could give it 4.5 stars,"Very good story, well told and with a surprising ending. I'd give it 5 stars if only aiming my teenagers, 4 stars for myself - but I'm a long-time SF reader."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Strange, supernatural game playing beings are at the heart of this book. They like to play games on a very large scale, as in planet to planet, and are not particularly nice.A young boy gets involved, and is made into one of the participants. He meets others, and they decide to do something about it, as well as running into the Flying Dutchman, the Wandering Jew and Prometheus."
5,A book to make you homesick!,"The Homeward Bounders gives you shivers down your spine! The plot centres around a boy from our world who sees something he shouldn't and is sent off on a tour of the worlds. He's been promised that if he finds ""home"" he can stay there. His hope is the only thing that keeps him going on his dangerous and lonely journey. But will his hopes ever be fulfilled? This is a book which is really funny in parts, but awfully sad in others. It's a book that makes you think."
5,"A Must Read...2, 3 or 4 times","This is perhaps the most important book I have ever read, other than the Bible. It is May 2008, and I am reading it for the second time this year...will probably read it again because it presents a totally different and life challenging perspective on my relationship with my Abba. If you want to take a deeper, perhaps long overdue step with your Abba Father, this book is a MUST READ. I am now buying copies to give away."
1,Disgusting,Shame on Amazon for offering Michael Vick collectables; doing so is only a shade or two less morally repugnant than selling Nazi Paraphernalia would be.
5,Beautiful,Clean and legible printing on charm. Looks beautiful on plain italian charm bracelet. Perfect starter charm. This is a great buy! I would recommend this with any name!
2,Really big but really interesting!,"I'm sure that there is someone out there for whom this large pendant necklace is perfect; but alas, that person just isn't me. I was instantly drawn to this item's low low price, but I didn't realize that this would be really big. To get an idea of how big this pendant is, take a soda can and use it to trace a circle (holding your pen and pencil straight, and not making it angle at the bottom). I think this is still a pretty piece, and I am trying to think of an alternate use for it. Possibly it will go on my Christmas tree with all my other jewelry mishaps. I was thinking of going with the theme ""bejewelled."" Oh, and also, the adjustable cord is about 18 inches long on one side, 36 inches if you lay it out along the side of a tape measure (as I did)."
1,Nintendo Game System,"Received the game system in the mail. Great timing. Unfortunately, did not receive any controllers with the console. Have to purchase these now. Probably would not have purchased if we had known they were not included. Have not been able to use system to determine if we like it or not."
1,DON'T PURCHASE FROM SISTER ZI'S STORE,"MY REVIEW IS THAT SISTER ZI'S STORE HAS NO SCRUPLES. THEY TOOK MY MONEY AND I HAVE NOT REC'D THE ITEM YET. I ORDERED IT ON JULY 4TH AND STILL DON'T HAVE IT AND DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS FROM THEM. THEY DON'T SEEM TO CARE THAT THEY TOOK MY MONEY AND DID NOT PROVIDE THE ITEM.MY GRANDSON WANTED THIS FOR HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE DOES NOT HAVE IT.SHAME ON THEM. AMAZON SHOULD DROP THEM FROM THEIR SITE, THEY ARE NOT AN ETHICAL STORE.I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN AND I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON AS I HAVE DEALT WITH THEM IN THE PAST AND ALWAYS GOT MY ITEMS. THE REAL PROBLEM IS SISTER ZI'S STORE!!!!!I CAN'T RATE THE ITEM, WE NEVER REC'D IT."
1,unimpressed,"When I was looking to buy a refurbished NES system, I figured that I should find an actual company that specializes in doing so. I was told that I would receive the best system in pedro's inventory. It turns out that it wasn't as described at all. There are many obstructions on the tv screen, just like my old nintendo did when I was a kid. The controllers are slow also. There is a little hesitation from when you hit a button and the game reacting to it and makes it difficult for fun and easy playing. I would not recommend this product"
1,bust,the item never showed up at my house. they refunded my money only after I complained. not a good buy.
5,I love the vintage games on this console & simple controller,"All the games are pretty cool for a short time. I like the way they are simple and don't make me dizzy like the newer games. Although it is a little difficult to get them to function, they pretty much always work, it just takes a little time. I own all the systems and have handed them down to my kids. Right now I have about 45 games for the NES. This is a very good system especially for the little ones, or the adults (like me) who want to reminisce the old times."
5,Too Expensive!!!,"This seller is dreaming that someone is going to drop $2,999.99 for an old Nintendo Entertainment System, when there are lots of used game stores that will sell you one cheaper. Its not like this NES is the last one available. Even if it is in mint condition, $3,000 is a pretty steep price tag. Plus with existance of the Wii Virtual Console is not like you absolutely need an NES to enjoy all the system's classic games (unless you perfer to go old school). I wasn't interested in buying, I just saw the price and thought I'd toss in my two cents."
2,BS,"Some times you can be so excited about finding a product, that you fail to see the small writing. I order this for my daughter and the controls did not come with the machine. And after going back reading the small print that was mention, so if the control did not come with the box why put it in the picture when advertising this item"
2,How am I supposed to know it even works?,"I have no idea if this even works. The console was shipped to me with two random games, and by ""random"", I mean two of the worst games imaginable, and nothing else that's shown in the pictures. No av cable, no ac cable, no controllers. Just a console. So now I have to order all of that stuff to see if the first order I made even works."
2,Nintendo,Sadly it didn't work. However the seller was great in taking it on return and testing to find the problem I found.
1,NES SYSTEM,"I received my system with no power cords or AV cords - which was not mentioned. So after spending another 10 dollars for an AC Adapater just to try it out, we come to find out that it doesn't even work. We have tried multiple games, and still nothing. We are going to have to spend another 15 dollars for a part to fix it.Thanks..."
3,20 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have to admit that the games are fun, but you get some of them on the NES Classics for the Game Boy Advanced. If you don't have a DS or an Advanced, I would reccommend eBay. You could find them for a couple of bucks sometimes. Did you know that it's been 20 years, since it first came out. That's right, it came out in 1985! Any of you people that are looking for collector's items, wait another decade. But, still there are hundreds of mysterious games for the NES, but I get tired of the NES easily."
5,A cheap knock-off worth the price,"A lot of people rag on the yobo NES knock off, but for the price it's just fine. I just bought one and while it is cheap and looks more likethe Famicom than the NES from the US, it plays the same and I really enjoy mine. If you're not buying one for some weird emotional value, the knock-off is just fine and actually has less problems than my original did when I was a child."
1,Nintendo NES System-Game Console,"I am disappointed - the previous owner did say that there was a little problem where you have to push the game down a little when you put it into the console but this is not working at all. I paid $75.00 in all and it doesn't work. I did all this on behalf of my grandson who wanted to give this to his mother (my daughter) for Christmas as it was her favorite game to play when she was young and he really wanted to surprise her with it. Sorry, but I do not plan on ordering anything used again on Amazon. Sorry, but it was my first experience with ordering from Amazon and I am not happy with the results.Thank you,"
1,Misrepresented,Just got my NES package for Christmas and I can't even play it because there was no power cord provided...are u kidding?? Why sale or ship something that can't be turned on? It's funny how the power cord is not included was not mentioned when buying this product.
1,Does not work,Item does not work. I have cleaned it and tried to correct the contacts within the NES but it still does not work
1,Another warning from another user,"Careful, all the ""NEW"" systems sold here say that they are NOT the original Nintendo spec toploader. Only buy tried and true Nintendo products.It's true that many people are waiting expectantly to see if Nintendo will ever rerelease their crown glory of their systems again, but don't be fooled into buying an illegal pirate from Asia.I know that someone else has already posted this before me, but I do want to clear up the fact that there indeed exists a Nintendo-spec toploader NES. However, most that are new that are sold are illegal pirate clones. Nintendo rules. Pirates are bad. Don't buy their junk. Make sure to find ginuine Nintendo products, especially if they claim to be brand new, when they are this old.If you do buy a Nintendo-spec NES system with a ginuine Nintendo seal of quality, this review serves its purpose. Kudos to Nintendo for making a system so great pirates are still making knock-offs of it!"
1,Very disappointed with the item...,I recieved a console only... Item description was false! There were photoshop pics of the original NES and I got a dirty used console only! Buyers beware! Price was too high for just a plain old used console.
2,Console itself wasn't in best condition,"The NES is a great console, but the one I got wasn't in the best shape. The logo was completely invisible, it took a while for the cartridge to work (more than average), and the controller was yellow and the buttons were sticky. I was going to use the case to make a small home server, instead of going and buying an expensive case. Was very disappointed about the logo, it may seem like a small thing, but this was going to be a display, not tucked away in a cabinet under the TV. I took the actual console parts out of the case, and they work OK. I couldn't see any evidence of someone opening it up before."
4,nes core SYSYEM,NES SYSTEM ARRIVED IN WORKING CONDITION. PACKING MATERIALS WERE MINIMAL W/ JUST ONE CRUMBLED UP NEWSPAPER. GUN CONTROLLER WAS CRACKED ON THE BARREL. NEEDED TO REPAIR THAT. NES UNIT HAD STICKY GLUE RESIDUE. NEEDED TO CLEAN AND REMOVE STICKINESS.GAME UNIT WAS PRODUCT ADVERTISED. ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER.
1,doesn't work!,We were disappointed because this NES does not work! We felt ripped off! We tried different plugs and turning it on and off several times but the screen was either blank or flashing and you can not play any games.
1,Very Unsatisfied,"Upon opening the game, the lid broke off.Whenever I put a game into it, it freezes up and I haven't been able to do anything with it."
2,not interested,"the purchase of the console was a good idea seeing how our original console was broke beyond repair. so this was just a replacement console of a well liked original good system, however just wished that we would've gotten the game or games that made this system popular. mario bros. with duck hunt. then it would've been a really sweet deal. good luck! And only one game controler was sent."

3,Definitely not for beginners,"I'm OK with it, because I am freshening up my Spanish, so there is already considerable knowledge of the language, but an absolute beginner would be lost.Also, I am only at lesson 4 at the moment, and already found 3 typing/spelling mistakes in the book - that is most annoying in a language book (it is annoying in ANY book, but in a learning book it is an absolute NO-GO).Cannot recommend it and am glad that I did not buy it but borrowed it at the library."
2,Not a Good Book For Beginners,I definitely do not recommended this book for someone who is trying to learn Spanish. I had 2 years of Spanish in High School and I was still confused going thru this book. The layout of the book is not conducive to learning spanish. It's skips over the basics and tries to engage you in conversations from the beginning.
3,Ultimate Spanish review,"This is basically a good text for beginners because it progresses throughout the book. I like the beginning dialogs and vocabulary lists. It has a tendency to jump around a little, but overall, it is a good book to start with."
3,Good for review...not for first-time learner,"I had two years of Spanish in college and four years later bought the ""Ultimate Spanish: Basic-Intermediate"" program to brush up on my skills. This has proven a good refresher course, but those new to the Spanish language should not purchase this for use as a ""self-teach"" program and expect to develop strong skills.Many of the explanations in this book are quite brief, and the written drills are very limited. Anyone using this as a refresher course would do well to also purchase ""Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Verb Tenses"" and ""Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Pronouns and Prepositions,"" both by Dorothy Richmond, for more extensive written exercises."
1,Look elsewhere,"I was unable to learn anything useful from this book. It gives a very broad discription of Struts features without explaining anything in depth. If you want to learn how to use struts, you will be better served if you look elsewhere"
2,Breadth but no depth,"While very short, this book is definitely not sweet. I needed a quick ramp-up on Struts for an upcoming project and while this book covers the basics is does so with almost no depth. Several chapters are only a couple of pages!If you want to know what Struts is, this book may be helpful. If you want to learn Struts in order to apply it, find another book. Also, the writing style is not engaging at all. At times it felt like reading instructions for doing my taxes."
2,Not very practicle,"I bought this book in haste and I should have looked at it more closely. Although very imformative, you would need a good knowledge of Struts to really understand what she's talking about. The book is too wordy and lacks complete examples. Example are in snippets and don't give you a ""complete"" story of what is going on. If you are trying to get a grasp of how Struts works I would suggest skipping this book."
4,2 buy or not 2 buy,"Sue spoke at a local symposium in September and I was impressed with her presentation on JSTL, a topic that at the time I had little interest in. Having been disappointed with a previous Struts book, that starts with ""Mastering"", I was looking at this one critically. BTW, as Madame President of Switchback Software, Sue actually uses/knows Struts....nifty, huh?OK, what this book is: A practical guide for programmers.What this book isn't: Struts-o-pedia. That's fine, ""practical guide"" isn't supposed to be exhaustive, by its nature.Bottom line: Great value, buy it! Definitely can't beat the price.<GARp/>"
2,Very poor coverage,"I really hate to see other readers make the same mistake as I did: being duped by the promised conciseness of the book. Yes, it is short and cheap. But unless all you want is to get a shallow introduction and an unrealistically simple sample to work, the book is a waste. The text is obviously hastely put together. It misses most of the features that are useful for any significant development effort, such as struts application modules and tiles, and its materials are awfully out of date. ""Programming Jakarta Struts"" by Chuck Cavaness is a much better alternative. Although that book is also kind of lacking in exploring the advanced topics, it at least covers most of the ground and is more up-to-date, which gives the readers a good background from which they can start the exploration themselves."
4,Where is the editor?,"Ms. Spielman has done her part covering the essence of Struts; I wish the editor has done his/hers because the book's writing gets a bit sloppy at times:P. 37: ""After we've determined that no errors occurred with the form properties, we can determine what necessary business logic must take place.""Now, I understand what Ms. Spielman is trying to say here but it's not what this sentence means.I think Struts is a very elegant framework and it deserves an equally neat coverage.P.43: ""Remember not use instance variables in your Actions. If you get the impression that I'm trying to bang this phrase into your head, you are correct.""P.57: ""It is a bit beyond the scope of this book to go into the DynaBean internals in the Apache Commons project, but if you have a burning desire to peek at the internals, you can go right ahead.""I do know some cheeky developers out there, but, again, it is the editor's job to smooth out the rough patches."
2,I really don't like this book,"After looking all the good review, I decided to give it a try. But I don't like this book because:1) Too many text. It's like reading a story book. The paragraphs usually cover 2/3 of the pages. It's hard to read (at least to me).2) Too few diagrams, which I found are very important in programming books.3) The sample app is hard to install. I am still trying to make it run."
1,Poorly written and completely useless,"Hate to say this, but this book is useless. It is poorly edited and more confusing than helpful. This book may be of some help to those who have used struts extensively but if you are a beginner, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Completely useless book,I've been programming for over 15 years and this book literally put me to sleep. I can see the big picture the author was getting at but could not follow her code at all to put together even a simple application. Would not recommend this book even to veteran coders that want to learn Struts. I would recommend it to those who have insomnia!
2,Too wordy,Let's face it: what makes a good book (primarily when it comes to programming) is the ability to convey the concept with step-by-step examples. This book was sooooo wordy with almost no examples. I couldn't see the BIG PICTURE I couldn't see the relation between the classes and all xml files. Struts is not easy to explain and a good book will walk you through with all the relation and EXAMPLES!!!! This one didn't:-(
3,Decent quick intro but hard to read,"A good effort to produce a small book that introduces Struts. It does it decently, but the quality of explanations is simply far from what one is used to by reading other Java technology top-sellers. I found that the book takes more effort and concentration to understand than needed, due to the lack of simplicity and straightforwardness. But otherwise it is a decent introduction whose great merit is conciseness."
3,"better than federation vs zeon, sorta","First off, this game is obviously a sequel to gundam FVZ, by the name at least. after playing it a bit i realized as much, it has some minor tweaks to the grafics and transformable mobile suits. there are 72 mobile suits and all the original mobile armors. the space combat has only slightly improved, though barely noticeable over FVZ, and is still considerably worse than gundam Encounters in space. it's story mode plays out the story of the original gundam and zeta gundam, with a twist, you can change the outcome of the game by completeing the hard missions in a special way. most of these just cause a pilot thast normally dies to live making a story branch off. all in all if you liked gundam: federation vs zeon, you'll like gundam gundam vs zeta gundam."
3,Natural Balance dog food,"I purchased this dog food for my daschund Missy. To be honest, I did not sample this product but I depended on Missy to give me her honest opinion. Missy loves to eat and has always eaten dog food with occasional bites of ""people food"". She ate this food, but not with her usual enjoyment. I did not notice any change in her coat either. I will not purchase this again although I don't think it is a bad product. I just feel that I can purchase another brand at my usual retail store."
3,"Talk button, battery problems - otherwise good","I own this phone, and I know several other people who also own it. One thing I notice about our phones is that it's *really* easy to brush the Talk button with your cheek while you're talking and hang up on the person you're talking to. It's actually extremely common and annoying - to the point where I believe I've hung up on people accidentally 30-40 times so far this year, literally! I bought my mom this phone as well, and she has the same problem. The battery's somewhat limited, sometimes I notice that the phone does not recharge correctly when I put it in the base, and is dead when I try to use it. Overall though, it's otherwise a nice phone. Sound quality's good, range is terrific. But I wouldn't recommend it until Uniden recesses the Talk button."
2,Recharging is a problem,"I've had this phone for about 2 years and have found many problems regarding charging. When I first got it, I found that it was wise to recharge the phone every night by keeping it in it's cradle, or it would not work the next day all day, but it didn't take very long to charge. The sound quality is excellent and it is comfortable to use and press the buttons. The charging problem got progressively worse and worse, so now I'm looking for another phone for my bedroom. I have this same model for our downstairs phone and haven't had any problems. That one is about 4 years old and I've had no problems with it at all. I think the Uniden quality on this went down."
1,This phone stinks --,"Difficult to program, terrible display and little small buttons that are hard to read.Voice quality is good, and size is good. But I definitely wouldn't recommend this phone."
1,Very disappointing,"I selected this DVD because one of the 3 programs was titled ""Stormy Adventures"" and stated it was designed as relaxation for the baby boom generation. There were no reviews so I realize I was taking a chance. I'm a retired night-worker who can't sleep in silence, and a gentle thunderstorm sounded appealing. This DVD, however, has no sounds of storms, rain, or any other natural sounds. It shows hurried scenes of storms while some small band -- piano, snare drum, et al -- play an annoying tune and inspirational quotes are shown on the screen. Definitely not what I had in mind, and sadly I will be returning it."
1,don't buy this,I got this swing And I will be talking it back. I put it on 5 and It will not move. I don't know what it would be like with the baby in it. I just tryed it.
2,Had to return swing,My baby absolutely loves her regular swing so we thought this would be a great travel swing. She cried everytime we put her in it. It really does not provide a full swing motion. She tends to like her swing on the highest setting and this swing barely moved in either direction.
3,Good swing for the price,I like the travel swings cause they take up less space and are less expensive. I got this one because of the price and the brand. I was very happy with it... until the second or third time I used it. The motor started to squeak! also the legs squeak if they are not spread out all the way after moving it from one place to another. I would(and have) recommend this swing for anyone.
3,Good for little babies - but not for big,"This worked great for my little guy for months. But since he got to about 14 lbs, the thing barely moves - even with new batteries and on the highest speed. That's fine for us - we got good use out of it because he's 8 months and crawling now - but I know many babies reach 14 lbs much sooner! He still likes to swing though, and it is a disappointment I have to kick it with my foot to keep him swinging! They say birth to 2 years but obviously not!"
1,Did not like this swing,"I tried Fisher-Price's Take-Along Jungle Swing then this Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the ""palm tree"" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around."
4,Would recommend,I bought this swing for my granddaughter. It is very easy to get her in and out of. She enjoys it. It does make a soft clicking sound similiar to the ticking of a clock. I think it was a good deal for the price.
1,THIS PRODUCT WAS RECALLED,i borrowed this swing from a friend. my daughter got her head caught between the seat bars and the frame. we were both very lucky that i was standing right there. later on i found out that the product had been recalled for that exact reason. please don't buy this swing!
1,"Safety Concern, legs can get caught between seat/frame.","Mattel has recalled the Rainforest version of the Open Top Take-Along Swing but not this one. According to Fisher-Price, the Rainforest Model numbers K7203, K7192 and K7195 were recalled due to entrapment hazards. When I called about this swing, they said the design was slightly changed and the seat of the Rainforest did not ""cradle"" the baby as much as this one, allowing the infants to shift to the side in the swing, and become entrapped. The baby can get caught between the seat and frame. Our 4 months old son has had an issue with his leg being potentially caught between the seat and frame while the seat is swinging. Fisher Price was very willing to accept back the swing and offer a refund. I have always purchased, and will continue to purchase, Fisher-Price products. But this is one product that should also be included in the recall."
1,Piece of Trash!,"Oh my goodness, what a piece of trash! I got this item as a baby shower gift and thought it would be perfect for my son. I was SO wrong! It's noisy, wobbly, doesn't swing all 5 speed variations, and was absolutely horrible to put together. I wish I had done my research and read reviews on this swing before registering for it. Never again!"
2,Well...it's small,"The size of this swing is about all it has going for it and it is far from the best swing out there. I put the swing on the 5th speed and it barely moves, so much for the other 4 speeds.My daughter is starting to explore her surroundings and get into things which brings me to what I hate most about this swing. My daughter pulls herself into a straight up sitting position by holding onto the bars and stops the swing, looking like she is going to fall out. I just pray that buckle is secure! She also likes to get her head trapped in between the legs and the swing bars to where her head is hitting the bars. So, I don't like leaving her in the room by herself when she is in this swing. If you don't like to get house work done or take showers, this swing might be for you!"
5,Just what I wanted,"I bought this CD specifically for the Bach Prelude. I was not disappointed. Although it remains my favorite piece, I enjoyed the other selections as well. They range from the American Appalachian Waltz and Simple Gifts, to the Chinese influenced Tan Dun to the Russian flavored Slavonic dance by Dvorak. If you enjoy the cello but don't want an all-classical album, this would be a good choice."
5,Erbarme Dich for Cello and Piano,"Erbarme Dich for Cello and piano - it was Yo-Yo Ma's recording which inspired me to find a transcription for Cello and piano (Spartan UK). Ma's Bach is the most poetic, instinctive and analytical: I once heard him play all the 6 Suites at once concert from memory & my feet didn't touch the ground for days afterwards."
2,"Great talent, but an unfortunate compilation","I bought this CD thinking that Yo-Yo Ma is a sure bet. Now, there is no disputing his talent, and when his playing is highlighted, it is certainly wonderful. However, on this CD, it is difficult to even remember that it is Yo-Yo Ma! Lost amongst guest artists, orchestras, and even singers, one begins to think that his name is the only thing on the CD.Certain tracks make me cringe. Simple Gifts, for example. Not only does he play this over-used tune, he has someone sing it. If you`re not sick of it from school choirs and preschools, by all means get this CD. Otherwise, invest in something of a higher musical quality than cliché pieces that don`t even fit into a classical catagory."
3,Yo Yo Ma Has Been Better,"The CD is very good quality, but I was not pleased with the selection of pieces. Moreover, Ma seemed to be a bit lethargic on this CD. His CD on Vivaldi is excellent. I would not say that about this CD. It passes muster, but we expect more from Yo Yo Ma."
3,Great if you're not familiar with Yo-Yo Ma,"This CD is a good sample of what yo-yo ma has acheived in his musical career, if you want a more in depth listening of his talents than I suggest getting the simply baroque CD. The only thing that I didn't like about this cd was that the compositions were to mixed up in the genres. There was a bit of classical, some movie works, a great song by John Williams, and some of The Tango series music. If you would rather listen to one genre, get a CD that just has Classical or Contemerary, don't get a jack of all trades cd."
3,Great book for those who have suffered most anything,"This is a great book about several self help issues and addresses recovery as the root of healing and self help. If you have ever been hurt or traumatized in any way, this is a book you need to read. With step by step ways on how to recover and not become stuck on the dependence of this issue.Those who have suffered something terrible will fall into the trap of co-dependency with Dr. Sinor also addresses in depth in the book. You can chose to be a victim or you can choose freedom."
3,im gonna go blind,"Don't get it if you have bad eyes.My eyes aren't all that good, so this unit is a bit annoying to me. If you compare it some of the other units, you will definitely see the difference. The only reason I picked this over the Visor was the newer OS that was on it. It also feels very flimsy, and the flip seems very very fragile.There is nothing wrong with the unit in terms of fuctionality. If you can live with the above, then buy it."
3,It's Okay,"This was my first experience with a PDA. It was really cool at first because I just started college and I didn't have to deal with the messy paper organizers. I grew to dislike it because I had to change the batteries left and right. I didn't much care for that. The thing kept crashing on me, I grew tired of having to plug everything back in. It's okay for the price you get. I would recomend this if you haven't had one before. It can get the job done if you fon't want bells and whistles."
5,This is a great tool for busy people! User Friendly!,"This is an excellent product for people with very busy schedules and lots of dates and appointments to keep up with. Before getting the Palm m105. I carried a huge organizer around and still missed many important appointments. After missing my daughter's dental appointment twice, I decided I needed a better method for remembering important dates. I'm a wife, mother, grad student and a full-time professional. This palm keeps track of everything! It has saved my life! If you intend to use your Palm primarily for keeping up with important dates, numbers and events, addresses, It is not necessary to purchase a more expensive Palm."
4,great for college students,This palm is a very good value for it's price. I am a broke college student and can not afford a 400 dollar PDA. If all you want is a place to write down your notes in an organized manor this is great. there are tons of free software for it and def get this one over the palm m100. it might be 50 bucks more but the 8mb is worth it and it comes with a 30 dollar value cradle! the m100 doesn't come with that and it is a lot easier to hot sync to your computer with it. the software is great. except I wish you could change the font style more. and the backlit screen isn't very good. I am very happy with my PDA and I think you will be too!
4,The Best Basic PDA,"The Palm M105 was my first PDA, and I've been using it for about 4 months now. It's been a fantastic organizational tool for me. It's eliminated the need for me to use a paper-based organizer. I believe this is the best PDA for anyone who needs a simple organizational tool. The 8 MB of memory is more than sufficient, and the price gives you the most bang for the buck of any PDA. I would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to get started with a PDA."
3,"The screen's small, and it feels cheap","I bought an m105 to replace an old Handspring Visor; I've also used a Palm V. Of the three, the m105 feels ""cheaper"" then the others when I use it - perhaps not surprising given where it sits in Palm's product line, and its all-plastic body with removable cladding. Out of the box, I damaged the somewhat cheesy cover hinge while putting it onto the PDA itself, and after a month of use, the hinge is starting to get floppy. Also, the screen is quite a bit smaller and harder to read then my Handspring - you might want to take a look at an actual unit before making the purchase, just to make sure it won't make you squint.Those negatives aside, the m105 does give you a PalmOS handheld at a reasonable pricepoint. Moving my existing data to it was a breeze, and version 3.5.1 of the operating system offers features that my Handspring didn't have."
3,Basically Basic,"As a grad student, price was one of my primary concerns in selecting a palm pilot to use to keep track of my calander, contacts and to do lists...which is what lead me to the m105. And for just that, it's fine....just fine. The features it comes with are very easy to use, it's incredibly simple to link to a PC - espically outlook, and even getting used to writing with grafitti wasn't too difficult. Now that i'm used to it however, I see the huge potential a PDA has - and finally understand why people by them for hundreds of dollars! I'd like to upgrade this to one with color, with more memory and with additional software. For what i was looking for - an electronic date & address book, this is great...but for much beyond that it's lacking."
3,Bad Customer Service,"The software CD that came with my m105 didn't work. I called Palm's customer care number and was told to call their technical support number which told me to call their customer care number. I begged, I pleaded, but I was told there was nothing they could do: they refused to replace my defective disk. It is true you can download the Palm Desktop software from the internet, but it makes me angry that they sold me, and refused to replace, a CD that doesn't work. Also, Palm's customer support doesn't seem to work very well: people are uninformed and apathetic. Palm's customer support makes me wonder what else doesn't work all that well in their company."
2,A step backward,"The processor is the same, the OS is the same (but now nonupgradeable), the size is a little smaller, but the screen is much smaller (25%?) and noticeably harder to read, all for the same price as an outgoing Palm IIIxe or Handspring Visor Deluxe (after rebate). Not much of an improvement, me thinks."
1,Nice while it lasts...THEN the wheels fall off.,"Granted...i bought a refurbished unit, and it worked wonderfully for a while, but it WILL develope the dredded 'lose data on battery change' problem. Disappointing. Hot sync before you change, and then after to restore data. I really wish someone would come up with *THE* fix, as i can handle SMT componants, and this spoils an otherwise great little PDA."
3,Small screen!,"My parents bought me this for my birthday, and I returned it within a week and bought a Visor Deluxe. Why? The only real difference is the screen on the M105 (and M100), which is noticeably smaller. With a monochrome screen to begin with, and the built-in difficulty of pointing and clicking on a Palm device, size matters.I'd recommend buying a Visor Deluxe, which is a better buy for the money in this price range, and has better expandability. I love my Visor! If you want to trade up, consider the Palm Vx, which my dad has. It's basically the same thing in a super-slim package with a rechargeable lithium battery, but it's costlier.I also have a friend who is very happy with his snazzy new m505, but in that price range I think a PocketPC might make more sense."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought a m105 in June 2003. It worked fine for a few months, then I started to lose all my data during battery replacement. Now, it takes me 30 minutes and half my battery power to hotsync after battery changes. There should be a recall from Palm but they are not ""man"" enough to deal with this problem. If you call them they will charge you $75 to fix this problem."
2,I wore it out after 4 months of use.,"Plus side: if you want something simple this is the PDA for you.Minus side: if you use PDAs as a lifeline as I did, find another model. This model wore out after a few months where I changed the batteries and all I kept getting was the ""touch center of target screen"" After I called tech support, they wanted me to pay $75 to fix it. I might as well get a new Palm pilot (I got this one as a gift), so I'm shopping for a new one. The only lifesaver was that I saved my files before it went bad!"
2,Not so good,"The Palm m105 started out to be a great buy -- cheap and reliable, but quickly changed to an expensive paper weight. It won't update to my computer and won't keep entries. Great idea, but too expensive to just quit working like that."
2,"Very useful, not very versatile.","OK, what do you do when you need a PDA and you don't have a lot of cash? You buy this completely forgettable Palm device, use it as a stop-gap measure until you can afford a decent Pocket PC or Linux based PDA. Palm has pefected the calendar and address book features of their handhelds (they thought them up and have the most practice after all), but the lack of versatility and connectivity with other windows programs makes this Palm a sorry purchase."
4,Pretty Good,"My Palm is pretty nice, but it isn't as great as it could be. I wish I'd spent the extra $ to buy a newer model. All I use it for now is to play games. I think it would be great to give as a gift because it is so versatile, you can do pretty much anyting with it."
3,not intuitive,"ok for the ""gadget smart"" younger set, but if you have trouble remembering how to do something twice in a row, this is not intuitive enough. Yes, Im from Palm Beach County, Florida, and yes I was able to use the butterfly ballot with no problem. If your are somewhere between gadget smart and unable to vote, consider sticking with windows operating system gadgets, if you have managed to master that"
1,Broken :-(,"This thing broke 2 weeks after my warranty expired. Interesting, isn't it? Their support 'attempts' to be good, but good support doesn't go far when they fail to resolve problems. Aside from their decent, yet increasingly out-of-date Palm OS, their hardware is a piece of junk. Don't buy Palm products. They were once the Kings of PDA's but that title just doesn't seem to fit anymore."
2,M105-many problems,"I have had many problems with the pda from Palm. The first problem was when I changed batteries; you are supposed to have one minute before you lose data. I had the batteries changed in less than 20 seconds and lost everything. Unfortunately, I had no backup as I had just purchased a new computer and the old one was sold. The other problems were the date; it would not keep the present date. It kept going back to Jan 2000. Also, it was hard to type on as the letters were not the ones that I struck. I am not happy with this product."
3,Good buy for those upgrading from a 2MB PDA,"The Palm m105 is pretty sleek looking but feels pretty frail in your hand. The screen also looks on the small side. Personally, buying a Palm IIIxe right now or something that you can upgrade the OS on would be better. The biggest drawback is lack of USB support out of the box. Why Palm forces Mac users and any PC user not wanting to tie up the only serial port on their computer or just get a decent connection rate is beyond me. I think that they are starting to integrate USB starting with the m500 though so that's good news. In summary, this isn't a bad deal if you're not the type of person who would ever bother to upgrade the OS, who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, and who just needs the basics."
2,A shoddy piece of plastic,"I was generally happy with this product when I first purchased it; it provided (at the time) the latest version of the PalmOS, a reasonably fast processor, and a small footprint for a reasonable price. I did have reservations about the power button, which didn't always work. Well, lo and behold, the digitizer is now not reading the graffiti correctly: it won't read 'i's, and it can't read the stylus when it touches certain areas of the screen. My recommendation: shell out more for a better model; don't get burned by this poorly-constructed product!"
3,Good BASIC Handheld,"If you need a very basic handheld, the Palm M105 is as basic as it gets, it does what a basic handheld is suppose to do. I like having the flexibility to enter data using the desktop software and just hotsync to have everything uploaded to the PDA.One disadvantage though, once you change the batteries, you lose everything, even if you change one battery at a time, so it suits you to hotsync often before your batteries go."
2,so far so bad,"I was really excited about my palm, but when I opened it and tried to work with it a number of buttons on the tap screen did not work. Now I have to send it back and wait for another one. I'm hopeful that I'll have better luck with the next one but we'll see."
3,An OK orgainzer,This is just an OK organizer. I bought it for my 14 year old and he is happy with it.
4,Comments about the Palm Pilot,This is an excellent product. It is the correct price but I think they should have more of them.
3,Exelent for the price but out of date.,"This is an exelent PDA for the price, but the processor is a little slow which makes writing in the note pad difficult - also durring the morning and evening when the sun is rising or setting the screen can be very difficult to read. But as my first PDA I love it, although I would reccomend getting a newer model over this one."
2,Unstable,"Have had my palm for less than a year and I'm shopping for a new one (Sony this time). Started with it not responding to the stylus, then false ""battery low"" messages even with new batteries. Unpredictable piece of equipment that's more trouble than it's worth."
1,Not able to return this item,I sent an email to both Amazon and the seller telling them both that as a senior I am unable to read the screen. I have not heard from both Amazon or the seller for return instructions.
1,Broke in two weeks.,"I am an avid electronics fan, but for some reason PDAs were never on my radar. As a birthday present my mom gave me the M105, and after spending two days with it, I was hooked. After two weeks, however, my M105 simply died. I never dropped it, or anything. I had to do a hard reset to restart it, and HotSync all the data. It lasted two days, and then died again. So I once again performed a hard reset, and while HotSyncing, it died again and has refused to come back on. I know the batteries are not dead, as I had monitored their level. So, my opinion is that Palm is crap. Now that I a used to having a PDA, I am going to replace it with a Sony Clie PEG-S320."
2,Works great as long as you don't have to change the batteries,"I received my Palm m105 as a christmas gift a few years ago. It worked well for my needs at the time. In recent months I have been using it alot more which therefore resulted in more changes of the batteries. Every time I change the batteries I have to sync up again. All of the additional programs I have loaded on have to be reloaded again after every battery change. I also lose some programs and have to completely reload them.... For that reason I am buying a new PDA, one with a rechargeable battery!"
2,More heat.,"This product did not meet my expectations. It doesn't have the ability to produce heat like other portables I've used. This might be adaquate for a small, well-insulated room, but its performance left a lot to be desired in my livingroom. And my livingroom is not a big room."
4,Works great,"I like the product. I have purcahsed and used the same design and brand in the past. Sold the old unit with a home. The only bad experience was poor packaging which lead to scratches on the unit. Since I am not using it as a show piece, I was OK with a few scratches."
4,The Sugar Is Sweet,"This album is the sister disc to the 'Boogie Chillen' cd that features JLH in a blue dress shirt & hat on a grey cover. 'Boogie Chillen's' 1st half is essentially 'Live @ Sugar Hill - Vol. 1'. This album makes up for what definetly seems to be missing from this amazing EARLY 1960's solo electric performance. I give it 4 stars b/c the the Sugar Hill songs on 'Boogie Chillen' are better, but that doesn't mean that this cd isn't worth it's printing. If you like live electric solo JLH, this will not be a miss."
5,ANOTHER GREAT BOOK FOR INDY DIE-HARD FANS!!!,McCoy really did it on this one! From the second I read about Indy's fight on the airship I knew it was going to be a great book. Every thing from the fight with the itailan Facists to the meeting with Sallah was exciting. Not one single paragraph was boring. Never did I think about putting that book down. I hope McCoy never stops writing.
5,A great new addition to the fantastic books of Indiana Jones,Max McCoy is one of the greatest writers of the Indiana Jones adventure novels. He introduces such engaging plots and exuberant characters; it's the kind of book you never want to put down.
2,Philosopher's Stone Mediocre,"When I read a book or watch a movie, one of the things I value most is plot. Philosopher's Stone, however, ran quite short when it comes to that. The overall plot was recycled from the matierial of the trilogy and glued onto these pages. Reading the first chapter was like reading a junior novelization of Raiders. At least I thought it could be redeemed in the areas of what I love most about Indy, adventure, romance, and the overall fun that is Indiana Jones. But again, Max McCoy fell terribly short in these areas and left you with a sinking feeling that you are reading this just for love of Indy.I am an avid IJ fan, but if you want a good philosophers stone book, read Harry Potter."
1,This was actually supposed to be about Indiana Jones,This book should definetly not hold the Indiana Jones name. Indiana Jones is soposed to be fun and exciteing but this book was rather boring. I really dont think Max McCoy ever saw the movies. I cant believe his going to try to right more. you can try to read this book but I woudnt recommend it
2,pretty bad book.....,"i read this book for the love of the character. i've been a fan from the get-go. i have a costume for indy i wear every halloween. i read alot and this my first indy book not from the movies.i agree with the other reviewer who said the plot was mediocre at best. the character developement was terrible. the descriptions of the events and the environment around those characters were worse. it seems the author thought he had do a minimal amount of work figuring the book would sell itself on indiana jones alone.that being said, it is indiana jones (even though the depiction of jones himself didn't seem to fit the normal mold), and that was the only good part.want good indiana jones? watch the movies, see the shows, skip this book."
5,Fabulous! A great read!,I got this book out of my library on a Saturday and finished it the following Tuesday morning. I truly couldn't out it down. It's the kind of book that you can't help but think about; you're constantly wondering what's going to happen next. I can't wait to read the rest of McCoy's books.
4,Professor WHO?,"The book was action packed and even gave me a detailed dream but honestly, the book was slow to develop. I read Indiana Jones and the Secret of the Sphinx and I finished it in 4 hours. This I finished in 19 hrs. Why? Because it lacked the thrill and adventure as to what happens next. That is why its a four star rating!"
5,The truest Threepenny experience I've ever had,"The Donmar production is to be congratulated-- their Threepenny is a scream from hell. In setting this production in the present/near future, they have driven home the issues even further than the Foreman version does. Mac is no longer an orientalized rogue from the past; he is a cutting edge serial killer and rapist who works in collusion with the police. Jeremy Sams's lyrics capture the spirit of the piece perfectly-- they are harrowing. If you are looking for Brecht in its rawest, most meaningful form, it's on this cd."
1,I was very disappointed in this recording.,Don't purchase this cd if you love the Threepenny Opera! This version is modernized and has lost the flavor of the original opera. I imagine it's not terrible if you've never heard the original but what a disppointment if you have!!! The new words are harsh and disturbing and the romance is gone. Won't someone please put the original on cd???
4,good atmosphere,"Slightly disappointed with orchestrational output, prefered 1954 wind instrumental version - too much piano in bass parts. However, full parts produced with no cut versions. Singing excellent with graphic feeling and characterization which mirrors German translation and undertones of the piece. Used as 3rd year music undergraduate presentation."
3,not regualr potency,"The product is 1:2 mixture, meaning you get half the amount of plant extract that would be in a 1:1. Cant tell that from product details. And since its listed with others that I know are 1:1, I assumed it would be the same"
3,Does this work?,"I used it for over a year and really could not tell any difference in anything. So, I have to ask myself, ""does this work?"" IMO its just better to eat from a food source if you're trying to get any internal benefits."
4,like,Can barely taste it mixed with water. IT is recommended to take this product at the same time as Brown Seaweed supplement to target stomach fat

4,No one would tell,A freaky storyline but a good movie. Any1 who likes Candace Cameron will enjoy it.
5,LITTLE KNOWN BUT WORTH KNOWING,"I was introduced to the music from METROPOLIS in 1989, and have been searching for the cast album for many years without success. I was delighted to find it here on Amazon. It is unfortunate that the show never made it to Broadway -- There are several marvelous ballads -- most notably ""You are the Light and "" It's Only Love. The music has dated -- it is recognizably late '80's but I highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys musicals such as CHESS, or Les Miserables... I have been hunting for sheet music and performance rights -- if anyone has information on either of these HELP!"
2,"""The BEST musical I have ever heard! ""","I have seen Metropolis when I was very young and was supposed to play Marta! I cannot believe how grand it really is! It was truely an extrodinary production and it's kinda too bad that it didn't last too long at the picadally theatre in London, Judy Kuhn was just amazing in it! I believe that brian blessed is BY FAR one of the greatest actors of this day and Judy Kuhn, well nothing can express what I feel for Judy Kuhn's amazing voice as well as her ability to act! :-) I believe that Metropolis is worth buying! It is very exilhurating listening to The Children Of Metropolis, it actually sends chills down my back listening to that song over and over again! I give Judy Kuhn 10000000 points for her efforts to play Futura as well as Maria....and also Brian Blessed is wonderfull! I encourage everyone to listen to this album at least once in the near future! 1"
2,Average,"Hey, everyone seems to happy with their purchase and that's great, but anyone familiar with the Fritz Lang silent movie may not want to purchase this CD. The story has been totally massacred. All the names has been changed, and some really bad dramatic moments have been added (i.e. ""Futura""). For years it has been a college joke for us, singing strains of the classic 101.1111 (including the out-of-tune Forman saying ""PUSH""). Judy Kuhn still manages to make the material exciting in ""You Are The Light"", and ""One of Those Nights."" I can see what they were trying to achieve, but you just can't compare it to the long-running shows of today."
2,Ultimate Manilow,Was very disapointed with the audio on this CD.The music did not sound like Barry Manilow.His music is usually clear with wonderful sounds from the band.This CD lacked the usual Manilow sound.
1,MISREPRESENTED PRODUCT,"I ordered a HYPERTECH 1000 Power Stat 160 Degree Thermostat. What I received instead was a 160 degree thermostat made by a company called MOTORAD. It is stamped right on the thermostat. A couple years ago I knowingly purchased a MOTORAD thermostat. After the installation & the first time the vehicle was turned on & allowed to warm up, the thermostat opened & stayed that way. It never regulated the water temperature. It simply failed in the stuck open position. This was the fact when the vehicle cooled off & i removed the thermostat. My experience with MOTORAD has been negative. I will ask Amazon to refund my money or send me a thermostat made by HYPERTECH. If MOTORAD is making thermostats for HYPERTECH, than this is false advertising. Because there apparently is no HYPERTECH thermostat. They should have made it clear that MOTORAD is the manufacturer of HYPERTECH thermostats. A real disappointment."
5,excellent!,I love this new hardware. My handy man had no trouble installing it. They are beautiful and look very rich. I am very happy with this faucet.
1,bronze faucet,"The faucet seemed okay, but came damaged and scratched. It wasn't even usable. I had to return it. What's worse it that I had to pay the shipping, without a refund. Amazon would not refund the full amount which I felt was bad customer service. I order many items online and this is my first bad experience. I will never order another item with amazon again."
1,BEWARE,DOES NOT FIT! Bosch website recommends this part #98066 for my bronco2 / ranger 83-85 2.8v6 and so does Amazon but it is made different than original equipment . This water pump looks the same in the photo provided but the blades on the backside are different and do not allow the water pump to mount flush against the engine block . I expect better from Bosch than this ! Very disappointing !
2,Broke after only a couple uses.,"I bought this to use for siphoning out some old gas from a tractor mower that a friend gave me. The first time I used it, it wasn't great, but it functioned, the second time I used it, the blue pump part cracked ever so slightly and started leaking gas, and also making the suction less strong. Don't waste you time or money."
2,disappointing,"This is an album of leaden preciosity. It only fitfully approaches the beauty and brilliance of Merritt's other work. The Eban & Charley soundtrack, though padded with experimental instrumental pieces, is more tuneful, more deeply felt, more persuasive, more ravishing."
3,Stephin Merritt has done better...,"And admittedly, he has also done worse, if we want to go on a song-by-song basis. True, the lyrics are still wry and the rhymes are clever, but unlike other albums, I didn't catch myself singing memorable little lines back to myself like I usually do after first listening to a new Stephinn Merritt-related album. I think my biggest problem, personally, may have been the lack of Stephinn's vocals. I felt that The Magnetic Fields made a turn for the better when he took over the singing duties many years ago. It's fine to delegate, but his misery-laden crooning is one of the things I like most about The Magnetic Fields. Claudia Gonson sometimes sounds bored or overwhelmed while singing, which works fine for some songs, but not for all of them. If you're not overly familiar with Merritt's generous output, I wouldn't start here, and if you're not a rabid collector of all things Merritt, you wouldn't miss too much by not having this album."
2,Stephin Merrit takes his melodies in a different direction,"Most of Stephin Merrit's work to this point has been backed to very catchy, tightly cohesive tunes, with simple and easy-to-remember synth-pop tunes. This album is a departure from that trend... Much like the Magnetic Fields' album ""Distant Plastic Trees"", the lyrics are layered over a background that sounds like the inside of a wet cave, yet somehow reminds one of the Jetsons cartoon as well. In that respect, this CD was a stunning improvement on what started in ""Distant Plastic Trees."" It is pretty good, but not in the direction I wanted to go. You served me Italian when I wanted Mexican...."
3,"Come on, Stephin","I hate to say it, but I was a bit underwhelmed by this effort. Though there are a few lovely tracks on this one, (No River, Smash the Beauty Machine and From a Distant Star in particular) I found myself feeling like the vulnerability and charm of much of Merritt's other work just wasn't there. Instead it sort of felt for the most part like a creepy excursion into a self-indulgent, over-produced, meanderfest. This may sound a bit harsh, but when Stephin is on, no one can touch him so it's a little disappointing when he's not on. And for the most part, on this album, he's not on (mostly)."
4,Synth Pop and Sharp Wit,"Do you like 80's synth music? Do you like short, cranky gay men with bitingly brilliant lyrical streaks? Then you should check out Future Bible Heroes. Future Bible Heroes is the moniker used by Christopher Ewen (Figures On A Beach), Stephin Merritt (Magnetic Fields, among others) and Claudia Gonson (Magnetic Fields). With Ewen providing the music, Merritt writing the lyrics and Gonson's simple yet likable voice bringing it all together, you have synthy music that works specifically because the lyrics are so, well... bitter and funny at the same time. Although Merritt doesn't add his deep baritone on this album, he does sing some of the songs live and on the previous work of the band. Quite an enjoyable listen, unless synthesizers give you bad dreams about hair mousse, leg warmers and parachute pants."
3,Sport Compact Car Engine Review,No real information here minus engine conversions. If you have a silvia and youd like to convert it to SR20 this is a decent book. Its really just a compilation of magazine articles.
