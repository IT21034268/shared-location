4,It's full of action and keeps you going until the last page,"It's an action-packed, dramatic book, in Richard Perry's point of view. It kept me reading until I was on the last page!"
5,This book is very realistic,"The usage of words to describe the way the soldiers were feeling was so dramatic the it will touch your heart. All the stories in this book are true to the fact, many soldiers died in that war and this book isn't afraid to tell how. The pressure put on Richie to write letters to the families of the dead soldiers in his squad, is almost too much for one person to take. I give it a perfect rating!"
4,Almost like a journal,"As an American soldier, I read this book with delight. Perhaps one of the best, easy-to-read, down-to-earth books written about war, it portrays not only the young men and women of the war, but also puts a face and soul to every character. From the main character's pining and missing home to the bond developed between fellow soldiers, Walter Dean Myers accurately portrays what it is like for soldiers on a deployment.For those comtemplating whether or not our current war on Iraq is justified, this book won't help with deciding that. What it does help decide, however, is that soldiers have families too. They also have feelings, emotions and most certainly, can be deep, as shown in the conversations throughout the book."
3,Required reading for 9th Grqade English,"My son had to read this book and enjoyed reading it however, I believe it was inappropriate for a 14 year old."
1,Phoney and silly,"The author knows very little about Viet Nam or the army. He apparently thinks the 60 in M-60 stands for .60 cal. and that soldiers put stamps on their letters when they were in the war zone. A patrol goes out without a radio, a soldier calls a latrine a ""bathroom,"" and the final bit of silliness---soldiers fly back to the states not on a jet transport, nor on a C-130, but on a C-47, a two-engine prop job built in the 1930s and never used in the Viet Nam War to fly across the Pacific.If Myers paid a vet to check the book for inaccuracies, he did not spend his money well.Because of the dialogue, the book's subtitle could be The Little Rascals Go To War. Soldiers' talk in this book is often too cute. For those who like mildly homoerotic war stories that little reflect the way things are, this book might be for you."
1,Account of the Vietnam War,"This book was a great recollection of the times in the Vietnam War, but also was a great lesson of how not to write a book. The harsh language and horrible attempt to emulate African American dialect was ridiculous. It was an easy read, but, all in all, one of the worst books ever written."
5,Good War Story,"Just about every other book I read for school i hated, except this one. I enjoyed reading it, there was a lot of action, and it kept me hooked. I could never put it down because I wanted to find out what happened next. This is probably my favorite book ever."
5,A year in Nam,"This is the story of a black soldier's tour of duty in Vietnam. Writing in the first person, author Walter Dean Myers adopts a minimalist approach that suits his narrator, a teenager from Harlem with a gift for writing. This style made it a little difficult to get into the story, and for a while I wondered whether I would be able to immerse myself in this novel in a satisfying manner. My fears were unwarranted. Although Myers's prose is quite efficient, he is adept at selecting details that accumulate over the course of the novel to present a full, moving picture of what it was like to participate in that harrowing conflict. Myers effectively portrays both the horrors of battle and the comfort of camaraderie, making for a fully rounded reading experience."
4,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,"FALLEN ANGELS takes place among the rice fields and swamps of Vietnam.Teenager Richie Perry is sent to Vietnam when he enlists in the war. For the first time in his life, he is far away from his mom and younger brother, who are back in Harlem, New York. Perry meets many friends along the way, such as Lieutenant Carroll, Peewee, and Monaco. Perry has to not only survive the war, but also the effects of the war -- both physical and emotional.Walter Dean Myers writes a touching story of a seventeen-year-old boy fighting in a very controversial war. This book gives readers a personal viewpoint of the infamous war that no history book can. Myers creates relatable characters that all readers are sure to love. This real-life, action-packed tale is one to please all readers, regardless of age.Reviewed by: Steph"
5,New Respect,This book gave me new respect for all fo the men who fought in Americas wars. I think that anyone of any age should read this book.
5,Great Intro. for the Vietnam War,"This is a great novel for people that want a headstart into the Vietnam War. It is told from a soldier's point of view and has a real-life feeling to it. The book is really easy to understand and doesn't have much hard words in it, although there are a lot of swear words which are considered 'normal' to military people. This is another one of the greatest books (and the most interesting)I've read so far this year and I think everyone should give it a try."
4,This was a thrilling book full of excitement and adventure.,This was a thrilling book full of excitment and adventure. I enjoyed reading this book very much. The book just made me want to see what happens next.
3,Fallen Angels- Read it or else!!,"This book was more than I expected. The intro was kind of prolonged but it eventually gets off to a good start. Richard, the main character really, lets us in his mind and what he is going through mentally and physically. His side kick Peewee also acts as the comic relieve; to me at least. I couldn't predict the end which made me want to read it more. I didn't expect it to end as it did but all in all it was a good book. The characters seem genuine and you can relate to the situations . I would recommend it for any avid reader."
3,Maybe worth a second look,"Walter Dean Myers'Fallen Angels is a story of Richard Perry and his newly found friends--Herman ""peewee"" Gates, Lobel, Monaco and Brunner--as they live through the Vietnamese war. The squad goes on pacification and patrol through dangerous areas. Their many adventures are filled with suspense and action. A good knowledge of weapons would help with this easy, yet jumpy, read. It helps to give a vague feeling of what soldiers went through in the war in Vietnam. This one time read is simple and not worth buying, though I did enjoy the book."
1,Nothing good to say . . .,"Bad story, bad script, bad dialog and bad acting. Movie budget was probably about a hundred bucks and they kept the producer happy by not going over. Unless you're doing dishes and need steady background noise, avoid this one."
5,British officer's Tale of the Early Revolution,This book is probably one of the most cited references of a first hand account of the events in the beginning of the American Revolution. The detailed account of the voyage to the colonies gives information unavailable in other places and his account of Lexington and Concord from the point of view of the British is extremely valuable. A rare find but a must read for any serious student of the American Revolution
5,Approaching the cross as both a crucifier and as crucified,"Crysdale uses personal stories and clear, coherently written theology to forward her feminist interpretation of the doctrine of the atonement. Only by embracing travail -- joy and sorrow, the sense of being a crucifier as well as being one of the crucified -- can we retrieve a meaningful notion of what Jesus' death on the cross means."
5,good product,"My 9 yr old daughter likes this game - although we've only gotten to the pre-game level. It's well done. Nothing spectacular, but it's fine."
4,saddle seats,The saddle seats have a very nice rustic look. They are built fairly well but have their weight limitations.
3,Prefer standard Fodor's,"Although nicely illustrated, this book does not contain the abundance of information that you will find in Fodor's standard guidebooks. I far prefer the information in ""Fodor's Italy"" to their new ""See It"" series."
5,very helpful,"I used the chapter on Galois Theory as a reference for a course I was in because it had such a concrete explanation on how Galois Theory works. However, it didn't mention anything about field extensions & barely mentioned groups. That's why I liked this book, it gives concrete versions of things like (off the top of my head) complex variables, matrices, Galois Theory, polynomials, tensors & more. There's a chapter on each subject & treats it in a very concrete manner. Any math student not totally comfortable with abstractness (as I was, with Galois Theory of equations anyway) would find this book helpful, imo."
3,A note of caution.,It appears that Dougal Dixon may have not been as original as it seems when conceiving of some of the creatures in this work. I refer you to The Alien Life of Wayne Barlowe. Read what Mr. Barlowe has to say on the subject and draw your own conclusions.
3,This is a great gag gift,"The funniest part about this book his how serious it pretends to be. Its absurd. The whole thing is just absurd. The pictures are hilariously bad. The story-lines are cliche and ridiculous. This is a fabulous gag gift, and that's about it."
4,good quality,its designed good.its not very quit but i didnt want the quite one too so i would have some noise privacy at bathroom.lolthe heather is preety good.not noisy.i like the product
4,"HIGH QUALITY CONTENT, POOR QUALITY PRODUCTION","LIKE SO MANY OF THE OTHER REVIEWS, THE QUALITY OF THE INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK IS SUPERB; HOWEVER, AFTER REVIEWING 17 COPIES FROM VARIOUS SOURCES, I HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE PHYSICAL PRODUCTION IS ONE OF THE POOREST I HAVE EVER SEEN. FOLDED AND CREASED PAGES PROIR TO THE PRINTING AND SMEARED PRINTING INK ON NUMEROUS PAGES LOWER THE QUALITY AND VALUE OF THIS BOOK. FOR THOSE WISHING TO COLLECT THIS SERIES: BLACK CROSS/RED STAR, VOLUME II WAS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT COMPARED TO VOLUME I.IF A CLEAN COPY OF VOLUME II DOES EXIST , I WOULD BE MOST INTERESTED IN PURCHASING IT, SO AS TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION OF VOLUME I.THIS SERIES IS AN AMAZING WORK OF LITURATURE, AND HOPEFULLY, PRODUCTION OF THE REMANINING VOLUMES WILL NOT ENCOUNTER SUCH POOR WORKMANSHIP.HANK PUSICH, hank_pusich2000@yahoo.com"
4,Quite a difference,I ordered these after I finally got around to replacing my 1997 Jeep Wrangler's headlights with Silverstars. These were for my foglights and between those and the headlights light brightness and reach were increased 50%. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because my BMW's have xenons and those are better still. I was next to a Lexus with regular lights one morning and mine were definitely brighter. A friend with a 2003 Jeep Wrangler is planning to get some after seeing the difference.
2,"Great Light, Poor Life","The OEM Headlights on my Honda lasted 5 years before the first one burned out. I bought two Silver Star bulbs and installed both. The light is pure white and is a noticable improvement in brightness over the OEM bulbs. I was very happy with my purchase until the first bulb burned out after about 3 months. I thought it must just be a fluke and bought another pair, replacing the blown one and keeping one as a spare. The second bulb burned out after 9 months. I'll be trying something else when the next bulb burns out!"
4,Much Improvement,"I purchased a pair of aux driving lights at Walmart and they were awful. They did not penetrate at all. Have no idea what the wattage was on the bulbs that came with the kit, but my low beams did a much better job. I was doubtful about these Sylvania H3ST bulbs, but after installing them I could see at once they were much better, much brighter. The penetration could be a little better, but considering what I had before, I am quite happy with them. Following the advise of my fellow reviewers (and thanks to you all), I will not use them often because these bulbs are rather expensive to replace."
3,New Steps - No Practice,"This video is very hard in that the instructor does not allow any time to show you the new steps. I have taken Step Classes for years and have several Reebok videos and this DVD has steps I have never seen. They do not look difficult to do, but they are complicated and if you are not given any instruction or time to learn them, it is frustrating to use. I actually have only used the video one time, and I stopped it after about 15 minutes and put in different one. As of yet, I have not had the time to keep stopping and starting and rewinding to watch these new steps slowly so I can learn them."
5,Good! RAM!,"This module fit perfectly with my mainboard, performs quite well. This is a must buy product."
4,Most useful keychain knife ever,"I bought this for my wife so she could have the functionality of a dozen other things being carried in her purse without the weight. I know there are women out there right now saying ""What? Are you nuts?"" but hear me out. She uses the scissors for hang nails. She uses the file for, well, a file. She uses the knife to open letters and boxes. There is a cuticle thing to push/scrape them into oblivion. She also uses the nail cleaning tool when waiting in line or any other place where there is time to attack the nails. The only bad thing she has told me about is that she lost the toothpick after about a month."
5,Courage My Love: A Book to Light an Honest Path,Merle Shain wrote with an illuminated honesty that lit the dark places of all of our lives. Her simple truth and beauty helped me navigate through some rough waters and I would recommend her books to everyone who ever struggled with relationships in any part of their life. She lives on in all of us who loved her lucid and profound writing.
2,only kind I wear,"Like I said this is the only cologne I wear period, but I had to give it a low 2stars because I order two bottles and one bottle had a leak in it so I never really got to use it, but other than that greatest cologne to me ever."
4,"Nice, clean, and crisp.","I was pleasantly surprised at the scent. It has that just out of the shower smell. It's not overpowering and lasts all day. It's definitely better than Michael Jordan by Michael Jordan. If you want a slightly more masculine version of Curve, this will work just fine. And if you a want more contemporary version of Tim Mc Graw's Men's Cologne, this will also do the job. At $15.00, it is among the best in its price range along with Diable Bleu."
2,Marginal at best - only for die-hard Heechee lovers,"This book is an overview of how the discovery of Heechee artifacts affected human history. If you've already read the Heechee novels, the only part of interest is a single short story; the rest is mere repetition. If you haven't read the Heechee novels, pass this over and start with Gateway"
2,Not his best work,"Mostly dry and repetitive narrative, but does fill in some detail in the history of man's investigation of the Heechee, and does include at least one good short story. A fairly light and quick read."
2,Just to kill time,"The first part of this book is really good, the story of Audee Walthers will keep you reading and maybe you will learn something about Venus, the rest of the book is going down and down as you read, it doesn't have any punch to keep it reading, I can tell you that when you finish the story of Audee Walthers close the book and you will be very happy, if you decide to finish it don't expect to much from it."
3,nice old book,"if you like old japanese print and don't wanna spend alot of money, then this book is perfect. nice print of different subject."
3,Hard to turn valves,"Valves are very tight. Almost needed pliers the first time I turned them. They are starting to loosten up a little after operating 10 - 20 times. Otherwise well made from brass, so it should last a long time."
5,Lovely Bones will have you thinking twice before passing a corn field,The first time I watch it I couldn't take my eyes away from the television screen had no idea what was going to happen next.The second time I watched it with my young children because I want them to become more aware of strangers and what does happen besides the fact we live next to corn fields..LOL
1,Where doth the fantasy lie?,Cookie cutter flat stereotypes of a middle class family; the always lurking sex predator killer next door and of course what happens after we die (aka heaven). It was such a plastic artificial world that it failed to convince me of anything other than - aren't computer graphics wonderful and let's pray (pun) on some of our unrealistic fears.Negatives: The editing was self indulgent and led to a cutesy confusing storyline.Positives: The acting was appropriate to the flatness of the story - a task difficult to achieve.
3,VERY dirty but cleaned up and worked fine.,"The CD was VERY dirty and sticky when I received it, but after about 15 minutes of wiping it down with lens cleaner it finally came clean. Was very disappointed with how filthy it was when I got it."
1,give me a break!,"When i finally decided to sit down and watch this movie i realized at the end what a waste of time. This movie was sooo disapointing all the way, sure is was a beautiful story, but half of the movie did not make sense, i mean come on! first, the so call limbo is just plain rediculous, second the way the murderer died is stupid, third i thought the dead girl was going to do more than what she did to bring justice to her death instead of just sitting up there on her cloud (so to speak) so basically like all the other reviewers that gave this movie a one star is right, this movie was seriously lacking."
2,Tries to be 'What Dreams My Come' but fails,"I noticed some people compare this film to What Dreams May Come.The magic about What Dreams My Come comes from the fact that we don't know what is happening to the main character. He doesn't even know he is dead. We learn as he does as he goes along his 'death' journey. Heaven can be an awesome place and we get to experience some of that through him.With the Lovely Bones we know everything already. The main character is going to die, we know if from the beginning and so does she. We are then stuck in a limbo (which she knows about) with her as she tries to come to terms with her death. The limbo that the main characters wife in What Dreams May Come undergoes is a much more convincing depiction.Yes The Lovely Bones has some updated effects compared to What Dreams My Come has but the 'journey' is just not there."
2,Do yourself a favor: Just read the book. The movie does not do it justice...,"There is no way to translate the morbid beauty and innocence of this wonderful book onto the big screen. If you do see this movie (which is a waste of time, IMHO), then make sure you've at least read the book. There is no comparison, and the movie should've not been attempted."
4,"Good, but the ending could be better","Its definitely worth a watch. I enjoyed it, however the ending was kinda ""blah""."
2,not so hot,"Well, I hope the book is better than the movie, because I found it not so hot. Actually, even silly. The drunk grandmother? All of a sudden a very serious thing becomes comical when she appears. There was no emotion that I saw that made me sad, no details, just long drug out scenes that left little to the imagination. I gave it 2 stars, just for their effort. blah!"
2,UNLOVELY,"This movie was a piece of sappy garbage. The nauteously overdone CGI heaven sequences bring the movie to a halt every time we are there. Jackson destroyed the few characters (and actors performances for that matter) who had potential to be interesting: Susan Sarandon, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weiz. The movie is a cut and paste job of the book that tries to do too much with too many characters. Jackson switches point of view just enough to never allow us to connect to anyone in the film.Peter, please go back to action movies. It is the only place where this much CGI can makeup for bad storytelling."
2,"Like ""what dreams may come"" but worse...","Pick a direction and stick with it - this movie tries to do it all. This movie is about the afterlife and crossing over, and is drenched in sentiment and symbolisms. This was like a standard child abduction drama, but it had the horrendous likes of ""the cell"" and ""what dreams may come"" added to it. I just couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing, and watched it at 2x speed most of the way.This is definitely an artsy movie, probably meant for people that like emotional tear jerkers and pretty scenes."
4,Good Movie,"Kept my interest through the whole movie, Pretty sad movie but makes you think about things that can happen. I have recommended this movie to friends and family."
4,Very good movie.,"There are more than a few good reviews for this film, so I won't make mine especially long. I was pretty much mesmerised during the whole movie. The story was fascinating, all of the actors did a splendid job in their respective roles and I thought the whole experience was entertaining and thought provoking. This movie is different and well worth the time to watch it. I have no complaints."
2,Bridget's Review,This movie wasn't one of my favorites but it wasn't horrible either. I felt like some parts dragged on for way too long. It had a great plot though. This is a movie that I watch once and most likely will never watch again.
4,"Different, but not bad",Good cast and excellent acting. Makes me creeped out about some neighbors around here. Tell your kids to pay attention. God loves kids.
3,Too much heaven...,"I likes the main story line, but the heaven scenes were ripped straight out of What Dreams may come and really distracted from the story."
4,great movie,"This movie has great acting, a superb storyline, and is so very entertaining. What a great way to spend an evening with family. A+A+A+"
4,LORD OF THE BONES,"Oscar winning director Peter Jackson shifts gears with this haunting translation of Alice Sebold's bestseller. The movie is beautifully filmed with gorgeous fantasy other worlds matched with stunning vistas of the real world. While Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon are fine in their roles, the movie belongs to Saorise Ronan and Stanley Tucci. Ronan is stunning as the murdered girl caught in a purgatory torn between her lust for revenge and a need to provide solace to her grieving family. Tucci's quietly malevolent killer is chilling. I would have preferred a more appropriate finish to his character, his ironic death is disturbingly satisfying. Not the classic it should have been, THE LOVELY BONES is nonetheless quality film-making."
2,In Defense of the Positive Reviewers ...,"Their hearts are in the right place, and I understand why many people will like this film. But I think the majority of viewers will be very disappointed. This is not a good movie. As other reviewers have mentioned, it has no point, and is mostly a tedious trip to nowhere that really drags on at times. I love spirituality in films when it is presented in a moving and intelligent way. For that reason I really wanted to like this film. But there were so many twisted and silly elements (it presented heaven as like a sunny day in the midwest) that I fast-forwarded through most of the last act. The performances of the very talented cast are decent, but have no chance of making this film watchable. At times it's pretty to look at, and it does have some nice music -- so for that it deserves 2 stars."
2,Very Strange Film,"This movie was sad,boring and weird all at the same time. I didn't like the ending either! Movies are suppose to be an escape from the troubles of this world. I could have skipped this film and just turned on the news!"
2,Afterlife,"Peter Jackson should know better. When you die, that is it. No CGI heaven or in-between, nothing. So please everybody, stop making movies about this subject, unless they are comedies and they sport Warren Beatty, are directed by Albert Brooks, or have the Archers seal on them. This tale is not suspenseful, nor rewarding. We are not children living in the 13th Century, so I don't understand the necessity of a graphical representation of a supposed afterlife of sorts. Sheesh. Two points for inspired visuals and the first 20 minutes."
3,Adaptation weakened by overemphasis on visual effects,"This was a great story as a novel. It could have translated well to the screen, but the producers spend so much time showering us with fantastic visual effects that they really take away from what should be the real focus of the story: the dead girl's observations and the aftereffects of her murder on her family.There is also short shrift given to the girl's mother and little brother; it's the father and the sister that get more screen time and attention.Stanley Tucci is perfectly creepy as the neighbor who is the guilty party (I am not spoiling anything--this is revealed early in the film because it is not a murder mystery for the viewer to solve).Saoirse Ronan is terrific as Susie Salmon."
5,Wonderful sad movie,"This is one of those once in a lifetime sad movies that make you think. I think I had a box of tissues beside me the whole time I watched it. Very good directing and great acting, I recommend it, but be prepared to cry if your a mush like me."
1,Painfully Boring Plot Lacking Purposeless film,"Need I say more. This film was a complete snooze and left me wondering throughout...where is this going? The storyline was so drawn out, all over the place and the movie was way too long. Nothing made sense nor did the disjointed pieces of the film tie themselves together in a comprehensible manner at the end!!The lead dead girl's body is never discovered and her murderer is not apprehended but randomly dies at the end in a ""Final Destination"" type of way?! The main clue that ties the murderer to the murder is handed off to a drunk and never spoken about or shown to the dead girl's parents who have grieved her death for months. I wasted my $1 on this film at the Red Box and want a refund!"
3,book is better,"i read the book first and was blown away by it,so i could not wait to watch the dvd..............it was beautifully filmed,but i was sooo disappointed..the characters of the mother and granny were diluted to passing people on the street,not to members of susie's family.the relationship of the mother,father and policeman,was changed, from an affair with the mother and policeman to one of friendship of father and policeman the quirky granny was showen as a hard smoking woman.and not as a damaged,scarred lonely woman...but the most disappointing thing,on which the story hinged,was the relationship with the goth type girl ruth.......to say more would tell the story....if you have not read the book you will enjoy the film,however,i urge you to also read the book,you will not be able to put it down..."
5,A Gem,This movie was an unexpected gem! The movie has a great story to tell worth the watch but grab a box of tissue you'll need it...
2,Doesn't Do Justice to the Book,"This movie doesn't come close to doing justice to Alice Sebold's extraordinary book. While it has a lot of lovely special effects, the gist of the story falls flat; the excitement is gone.The story is about a young girl who is murdered by a serial killer. Her family is torn apart by the ordeal and each of them, in their own way, can't get over the murder. The murdered girl watches over her family from a semi-heaven as she, too, can't fully let go of her life. The actors in the movie (Mike Wahlberg, Susan Sarandon, Rachel Weisz, Stanley Tucci) are usually top-notch. However, in this film, their performances are rote. The only performance that stands out is Stanley Tucci's as the creepy murderer.I recommend you see this on DVD or skip it altogether. Do yourself a favor and read the book. It's astonishingly beautiful."
1,Plot holes galore!! New Age junk....,"Ugh!! I hated this movie...good thing it was only a rental. I thought the depictions of heaven were ridiculous and certainly reminded me of the Robin Williams flick ""What Dreams May become"". Think massive bouncing beach balls and you get the picture. The ""New Age"" imagery was nauseating.The pedophile in the movie was the dumbest I have ever seen who turns out was the luckiest. Who builds a secret underground sex den in the middle of a field surrounded by houses?? What did he do with all the dirt?? LOL..nobody notices this?? He approaches his victim in broad daylight in middle of said field..nobody notices?? How did he destroy his den?? He kept a ton of keepsakes in it..the police couldn't get one clue out of it?? How did get that 500 pound safe up from his basement to his car by himself?? Why did he park so far from the dumping pit instead of pulling closer?? LOL..I could go on...but I already wasted enough time with this movie."
2,Very disappointed.,"A large portion of the book was not in the movie at all. If I didn't read the book first, I wouldn't have understood it at all."
4,"Takes A Different Direction From The Book, But I Still Enjoyed It!!","As for someone who has read the book by Alice Sebold, I can tell you that the film adaption to The Lovely Bones takes somewhat of a different direction.I personally did enjoy the film, but It did have some things that would have left most viewers thinking about what really was going on.Most hardcore fans of the book will be totally dissapointed in this adaption by Peter Jackson.Take this film with a grain of salt."
3,Watch it for Stanley and Mark,"When Tucci appears, The creep meter jumps. I'm not letting him babysit. He is so good, he rises above the pretty colors of heaven."
2,Sloppy work,"While I was as eager as anyone else to enjoy the unusual premise of the movie and hope for retribution for the killer, there were two glaring flaws that turned me off. Didn't the police take fingerprints in the hidey hole? There were certainly enough objects the killer handled there. The other was the heavy safe that took two men to roll ponderously over the ground to the dump. How did the killer get it up (or down for that matter into the underground hole) from the hole, onto his truck in the first place? Where were the brains behind these scenes which were so obviously illogical? Other than those serious glitches, I applaud Stanley Tucci for his performance. Tucci has played disparate roles in the past as Julia Childs' fond husband, the wardrobe master for Meryl Streep, and was superb in each. Did anyone else notice these two points I set out?"
4,Interesting,"A good dvd to watch but the synopsis is somewhat misleading. There is no interaction between the dead girl and her father, so if you are waiting for it, don't be. It is a good movie to watch and the ending is more like life is, sometimes you don't have a ending to a question. Like did they find her body? Was he caught? It's a movie you can sit down to and find that the 2 hours go very quickly."
3,It was ok.,"I didn't read the book, Lovely Bones, so I can't compare the movie to it. All I can say, is the movie was just ok. I didn't hate it but the acting wasn't great and there was too much focus on being overly creative with the afterlife aspect of the story. They could have done a better job of intertwining the two worlds together."
2,Only a second star for Peter Jackson,"Although picking such a crap book to do a movie of was pretty stupid on his part. The book was awful so he had nothing to work with. I hated the book so of course I hated the movie. I had hopes that Peter Jackson could do something to make this stupid story worth watching, but he made the huge mistake of following the book. Of all times for a director to actually follow the book this was not one of them! Hideous book, hideous movie. Don't waste your time on either. When I bought the book I was hoping for something like ""Stir Of Echos"" and instead got something that smelled like bubble gum and was all tied up in pink bows. Yuk! Only 10 year old girls could tolerate this garbage."
1,Truly Awful,"Note to Hollywood:Just because you CAN do it with computer graphics, it doesn't mean you SHOULD.This movie was great right up to the point the narrator dies, and then it IMMEDIATELY devolved into complete unwatchable garbage -- and with some of the most inane visuals you've ever seen.I bet the author was crushed to see what they did with her book, and the young actress was fantastic, but that's not going to transfer to the phone ringing for more work after this bomb."
2,"Heavy on indoctrination, light on substance","Seeming more like a replay of the old movie, ""What Dreams May Come,"" this movie seems more concerned with revealing a concept of an ethereal afterlife than it does providing entertainment with substance. There are short sequences of suspense but the remainder of the movie is split between the drama of the loss of a child and fantastical afterlife CGI. This is not a horror film, nor is it a mystery. It is a long, mystical ride that leaves you wondering what the point is."
2,Lovely Bones dvd arrived used,"Though I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, it did not arrive as advertised. It had a ""previously viewed"" sticker on it, when I bought a new video. I did not return it, because as long as the quality of the video was acceptable, I did not feel like going through the drill and pain of the return process. This is the first time I've had these kinds of problems with Amazon, though I have had problems with Amazon's video vendors in the past. I will probably still order dvds from Amazon, though I will be much more discerning in the fine print, and will return anything not what it was advertised to be."
2,Poorly written screenplay equals bad film adaptation of a lovely book,"What a lousy adaptation by Peter Jackson of the Sebold novel. The story was fragmented and the characters were absoloutely shallow and cartoonish. Perhaps Jackson's embellishments were a futile attempt to make the film commercially viable - but, instead it fell flat. Even the weird serial killer/neighbor character played by Stanley Tucci could not salvage it. And, those dreamy sequences could have been clipped right from a television commercial - boring and without depth. Save your time and money and skip this bomb."
1,"Boo, Peter Jackson, were you on acid when you directed this?","I rented this from the ""RedBox"" today for $1.00. I'm grateful I didn't pay more to rent it because it sucked. OMG, I was ready to slit my wrist to have this dragged out, nutso movie end. #1 It's slow and boring as can be. #2 Peter Jackson & his wife Fran, were involved in its making, so I thought it would be a dynamite movie, but unfortunately, they were tripping on magic mushrooms or peyote buttons while directing this. I could tell you the whole story in a small paragraph because that's all there is to it, the rest is a crazy psychedelic trip. You'll need psychedelic stuff to enjoy this.That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it."
1,Simply Unwatchable!,"I had high expectations awaiting the arrival of the DVD""The Lovely Bones"", and all I can honestly say, it had to be the worst film I've seen in years. Flat, empty cardboard type characters, a meandering script that had so much fantasy you thought you were watching a bad cartoon, overdone and all over the place, I had no idea of what I was watching.Stanley Tucci was great though, and brought a real creepy presence which gave the film some grit which it very much needed."
2,"5 Stars for Present Day, 0 Stars for The Other Place,Minus One For The Rhoda Gets Zapped (Bad Seed) Ending = Two Stars","Liked the present day part, well at least the acting, esp. at the beginning (even though Jackson lingers way too longingly over the teenaged boy's curls and eyes, pretty predictable)> Hated, really hated, the Other Place scenes (spoilers ahead -- like we didn't see where the plot was going with Susie's mentor, Holly.....please -- spelled out like a billboard from the start.....). But the Tucci cornfield scene makes the entire thing worth watching. I remember loving the book, but his is a very, very mixed bag."
1,Great Book. Terrible Film.,"Where the book was mesmerizing and lyrical, the film just fell flat. I found it hard to believe that such a dud of a movie could come from Sebold's beautiful prose. I found myself getting impatient and irate, particularly in scenes where they tried to bring in the other world; they did not ring true. I was so disappointed that I vowed, for a time, to just skip film versions of much-loved books."
1,AWFUL.,"If you read the book and enjoyed it, do not watch this movie--it is soooo awful. The scenes where Susie is watching on are so cheesy--it's really painful to watch. EEK! The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I can't give it .5 or O."
2,Just bad.,"The effects were bad, I mean she didn't even look like she was actually there in the ""in between."" You could tell it was all fake. Her mom looked way too young, and it was a bad attempt at a sad movie. There was no twist or surprising event. Everything was shallow and stupid. And the ending was retarded and completely unrealistic. When she went back that one last time, I was in WTF mode. [Can't really say more than that without spoiling it]1 star for the main actress, as I thought she fitted well.1 star for the part in the trailer where she wooshes by that other girl."
2,Slooooooooooooow,"Most of the other negative reviews say it all. CGIs - a little go a long way. Stanley Tucci was good -believable and creepy. Susan Sarandon- way over the top. Comedy as relief just didn't work here. The running time of 4 1/2 hrs though was a little long! OOPS correction someone just told me the running time was only a little over 2 hrs. It just seemed like it would never end. I have not read the book, but I intend to so as I've heard it's good. Can't say that about the film though."
2,"""The Lovely Bones"" is a great vehicle for Ronan but the rest feels like two different movies","Length:: 6:19 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie ""The Lovely Bones"" directed by Peter Jackson and starring Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, Rose McIlver, Susan Surandon, and Stanley Tucci.[...]"
3,"Movie okay, but I am comparing to the book","If I would have seen the movie without reading the book, I would have never understood what was going on."
2,will not watch again,"after reading the book, i decided to watch the movie, but i was extremely disappointed. the book seem more real than the special effects in the movie. the dead scenes were not as i had imagined them (as it usually happens after one has developed their own images when reading the book)."
4,Haunting and evocative,"I just watched the movie Lovely Bones on a plane coming home from Italy. I found it haunting and still cannot get it out of my mind. The subject matter is intense and the movie may not be appropriate for children. I have not read the book and now I intend to. I found the acting to be top notch; especially from Saoirse Ronan, Stanley Tucci and the young New Zealand actress Rose McIver who played the younger sister. The score was evocative and effective.I thought that Peter Jackson brilliantly captured the look of 1970's American suburbia with the clothes,(especially Susan Sarandon) the neighborhood, and Jackson using in certain scenes, a sepia tone similar to my family's old Kodak photographs from the 1960's and 1970's.What was especially eerie for me was the neighborhood was remarkably similar to the one I grew up in suburban Boston in the 1960's and 1970's."
3,A somewhat engaging film,Tragedy meets fantasy in this tale of a young girl murdered by a local. Her grieving parents struggle to keep their family together as the girl's ghost stays in some limbo land trying to expose her killer before moving forward. Based on a novel. MY GRADE: B minus to B.
3,Lovely Bones,"It wasn't at all what I expected. Loved the book, but if I would have seen the movie first would not have read the book. Movie, was just not at all what I thought it would be."
5,The Lovely Bones,Good movie. Got one for my granddaughter and one for me. She loves it. I like it but it is sad.
1,Made no sense,"I hated this movie, I rented it for my girl. Total chick flick. Guys please save your money and not not rent this horrible movie."
5,Deeply Moving Movie,"This movie is deeply moving. If you want to see what a spiritual psychic sees on the other side, then you'll appreciate the impressively true and visually stunning visuals. This story is about the soul of a young girl who can't move on to the higher realms because of her traumatic death. Things unfold in a realistic way on the earth plane and she is able to influence this earth plane enough to get resolution and ""let go.""Visually stunning. True to form in regards to the afterlife. Deeply moving for anyone who has faced the loss of a loved one and needed help in letting go.A traumatic story line and at the same time a profoundly beautiful movie. Highly recommend it to spiritually-sensitive people, not to people who live in their critical/rational mind and insist there's nothing more to life."
5,FILLED WITH FACTS AND INSPIRATION&#65533;MY NEXT VACATION!,As a beginning yoga student I've been searching for a way to improve my skills and have a great vacation too and this book pointed me in so many great directions-I don't know where to go first! I really love the guest comment section because you get such a great feel for what's unique or special about the retreat. A great book for yoga students of every ability. See you in Peru!
4,A Needed Introduction to War Crimes in Iraq,"_In the Name of Democracy_ does a good job of explaining what constitutes war crimes (it's not just torture) and setting out the case that the U.S. invasion of Iraq violated international laws. There's a lot to digest in this book, not all of it pleasant, but I found the discussions of the importance of international law to be useful and not too over-scholarly: I learned a lot. The parts toward the end about resisters and how to put a halt to war crimes were interesting and inspiring and provide a more personal connection to a lot of the issues raised in the chapters. The book ends by looking at the connections between the subversion of international law and the subversion of U.S. law, which should be of interest to anyone who values democracy and liberty."
1,Absolutely left wing propaganda & garbage!,"I've read this book and I will state flat out it's not worth the paper it's printed on, too bad that trees were sacrificed to allow publication of this garbage. I do NOT recommend this book to anybody who's looking for an objective appraisal of the ongoing war in Iraq. I had a copy of it. I threw it out with the trash! For shame that any author would be able to write this garbage and actually get someone to publish it. Of course it takes all kinds I suppose! Don't waste your money or your time! I give it ""1 star"" because Amazon doesn't offer a ZERO option...they should, it'd be useful in this case."
3,"Diferente, pero bueno","Este album, como el anterior, parece como si LFC estuvieran entrando en una etapa de experimentacion musical. ""Calaveras"" fue oscuro y mas rockero; era tipico LFC. Este, no obstante su mensaje positivo, es mas suave y mas latino y diferente. Una verdadera sorpresa.Ademas de eso, me parece que LFC quisieran alcanzar o agrandar su publico. Tal vez lo lograran con este disco.Total, me place."
1,Basura !!!,"No se que estuvieron haciendo los integrantes de Los Fabulosos Cadillacs en este disco, pero este disco es basura, excepto una cancion que si puede ser un hit comercial. Me agrada mucho Los Fabulosos Cadillacs pero me sorprendieron con este disco que contiene mezclas de punk, tango y rock, la cual no fue hecho con calidad. Que pena !"
1,Total WASTE,There truly are NO redeeming songs on this poo-poo platter album. DO NOT waste your money like i did. It obviously took LFB a few years to make their music work. Listening to this album leaves one AMAZED as to how much LFB has evolved. they used to be REALLY terrible. Don't believe me? Then go ahead and throw away your money on this album. I wish someone would have warned me against it. i hate wasting money.
2,What a pity ...,LFC have definitly lost their soul and inspiration ... Vasos Vacios was their last breath ! RIP
3,Struggling...,"This album is growing on me...slowly. I do believe we need to give artists support to grow and change. However, as much as I love L.F.B., I find myself wishing they had made the transition a little less 'bumpy'. Also, I think some of the cuts would have been better just left out. I will hope they don't stray quite so far from some of their earlier work on their next album...or at least give us a smaller sampling of changes to come. They are one of my favourite groups, and I am a non-Spanish speaking Canadian! I will keep my fingers crossed that the next album is a little truer to the previous albums that I love so much...while also trying to do them the honour of keeping an open mind."
5,I'm a New Zealander with a passion for music.,This is my favorite CD of all times. The lyrics and music are absolutely wonderful. You could say I'm addicted to this CD. Jewel does a superb job with every single song on this CD. A MUST HAVE!
4,If i could tell the world just one thing it would be.....,"see Jewel live. this experience makes Jewel's Cd''s seem like they are missing something. iam a huge fan and love anything she does so this review is extremely biased but let me if you liked the first album but didnt like the 'baby-ish' songs ie. I'm sensitive then you'll love this album. her singin is better 10 fold and her lyrics alrhough bordering on preaching, which i for one didnt like the cd is a good one and shows Jewel's growth not only as an artist but as a person. oh yeah and if you think that Jewel isnt cynical then go see her in concert, she may be known by the world as a singer but let me tell you her true telling is story telling"
2,Who will save Jewel's soul?,"This album demonstrates exactly how shallow whining teenagers can be. If I could tell the world just one thing, it would be: Check out the Blondie album...it's much better."
5,Really Good CD,"This is a really good cd, although not much like the first one. It is really obvious that she has grown alot in these past 2 or 3 years"
4,One Who Appreciates The Beauty Of Truth.,"Some say that Jewel's lyrics are simplistic and lack depth. Some recognise that underneath it all, the truth is simple. In ""Spirit"" (as well as ""Pieces Of You""), she is singing in the language of truth. As complex as life can be, the truth is always there. Like her namesake, Jewel shines quite brilliantly in her music. She sings from the heart... And within our hearts (or subconscious minds), are answers that most of us never dreamed we could find. In ""Spirit"", Jewel continues to stay true to her music, her fans, and her fathomless heart."
2,A sleeper,"Jewel has a great voice and a nice folky sound, but this CD is really for insomniacs. It should cure them! No wonder we don't hear many cuts off this album on the radio. It stinks!"
4,"Not as personal as Peices, but a nice follow up","I wish that jewel had returned to the same coffe shop she recorded ""peices of you"" in, and made her second album there. This album does not have the local-artist-just-having-fun-with-a-guitar-and-an-audience vibe that made her first album so wonderfully personal and friendly. I also noticed she does not have as many ballads as ""peices"" did, and at times she sounds almost jaded, but she is obviously a talented singer/songwriter that could become another joni mitchell/bob dylan if she returns to the intimacy of ""peices"". Some of the tracks on Spirit reflect the carefree local feeling of her debut album, such as ""Do You"" and ""Innocence Maintained"" but some of her songs, such as ""Enter from the East"" and ""Hands"" sound more like Ricki Lee Jones than Jewel. I defintly recomend buying peices of you first, because it is more personal than Spirit and it is more than just another live album."
5,Best songs ever.,I think that Jewel is a well talented singer and she knows how to sing and as well know how to make a person understand about rough times in life. She is just so cool and I love her music.
3,Another Angle by an Angel?,"Jewel can see the world from another angle, but did she have to change her angle when it has to do with her music? Its understandable that she composed her music to be more radio friendly to satisfy record producers demands, but the drum tracks take away the soul of her music. What makes Pieces of You so special, is that fact that every aspect is pure Jewel. Morning Song and Angel Standing by are excellent examples of this. I lost some of my Jewel spirit in her new album."
3,"Great Music, Preachy Lyrics","I love Jewel and looked forward to this album for a while. I love the mellow sound and beautiful vocals, however the lyrics are almost stopping me from listening to the cd. I hate the preachy-ness of this album. Everything is ""golly-gee we can save the world if we just love one another.""Its almost a step backwards lyrically from her previous album. There is no depth, just hallmark sentimentality."
1,Yuck!,"Same as ""Pieces of You"" except with even fewer hits. The lyrics are so maddenly simplistic, and sometimes silly, that it seems that Jewel is trapped in 10th grade poetry class (my aplogies to 10th graders everywhere). The songs are neither cleverly written nor cleverly arranged. What a waste of one of the most angelic voices on earth. Please, please, Jewel, make a cover album with other artists songs so I don't have to listen to the #@!^%# you compose!"
2,A flop,"This is a weak effort. Sure her lyrics are pretty good (hence the second star) but the high school talent show guitar playing and her countryish voice are not getting it done. I couldn't pay attention to one song long enough to remember it. While riding in the car trying to listen to this my mind wandered everywhere and I looked doen and thought, track 12, already? I know that this makes some of you psuedo-intellectuals feel ""smart"" when you listen to it, but I suggest you take a course in Differential Equations for that. I love ""Who Will Save Your Soul"", and wait for an album that sounds like that song, but until then I'm going to pick on my wife for buying this for me for Christmas (I could have gotten the Partridge Family's Greatest Hits cheaper)."
1,"Arrogant, Insulting, stick wtih Pieces of You!!!","After hearing Jewel's wonderful first album, I was excited out of my mind about Spirit. I REALLY wanted to like it. I was disappointed song after song by the excessive electronics (the very end of a ""girl w/ a guitar""). However, not only are Jewel's vocal and guitarist talents hidden, but because of her sudden success, she has obviously gotten a big head. She believes herself to be far risen above the rest of her generation (which I, a 16 yr old guy take as an insult). because she is so famous now, she thinks, she can preach universal truths to us all. It's not lyrical simplicity that I have a problem with, it's simple arrogance. How about listening to older concert recordings that display her superior talents instead?"
2,Lack of Spirit!,"It seems that Jewel has sacrificed her talent to sound like all the other annoying faux-folk female singers you hear on the radio today.This album is a snore. Pieces of You touched me; Spirit is watered down and overproduced. There are one or two songs worth listening to, but thats about it. Hey amazon, can I get a refund please?"
5,"If you ""get it"" you'll love it.....","Jewel's lyrics speak at such an abstract level of emotion and elevated level of cognition that many listeners simply don't have the ability to reach. And it is those unfortunate ones that consistently misinterpret her as ""simplistic"". I applaud Jewel's sensitivity, creativity and her incredible intelligence."
3,I EXPECTED BETTER OUT OF JEWEL,"For those fans of Pieces Of You-- buy the single of Hands and leave it at that. This is not a Jewel quality CD, it's more the quality you'd expect from Billy Joel (one or two good songs and a lot of filler). This is not to say I don't somewhat like the CD, it's just not ""omigodthiscdkicksa**"" quality."
3,Overproduction ruins what could have been the best CD.,"Jewel captured the hearts of millions with her first album which languished on the market for nearly two years before it caught on. Most of her fans from the early years valued her simple beauty and honesty. She accompanied herself with able fingers on acoustic guitar. Now ""Spirit"" is released with 'canned' band backing music that sounds like it is being played in the neighboring apartment and does not really go with the vocals. To make it worse, much of the acoustic guitar work is not by Jewel. This is still an album worth having but Jewel deserves so much more than Atlantic delivered."
1,What a letdown!,"I was a huge fan of Jewel before I bought this album. I absolutely loved her first CD from the first note. But there is NOT ONE good song on Spirit. Not one. She sounds like she's trying too hard to prove she's 'grown up', and she's so mature now, that she's not writing good hooks! What makes her first CD so good is that's it's not 'songwriting by numbers' like Spirit is. Please don't waste your money. You'll thank me for it later. And if you don't get a chance to, I'll say it now....""You're welcome!"""
1,She has a little growing up to do,Her attempt at poetry is weak and child-like. A person trying to sound deep comes across as empty when they really don't know how to express what they don't know.
2,"Jewel's New Album Is A Lovely, Lovely Bore","This album reminds me a lot of the Blondie song ""Sunday Girl"", except that THIS album is so soaked in new-age schlock it just kind of sits there. And Jewel takes herself SO seriously. She could use a little humor on this album and less of the I'm Okay/You're Okay dynamics. What I liked about her first album was the mix of Storytelling like on ""Adrian"" and ""Daddy"" and the silliness of the likes of ""I'm sensitive"" and ""Morning Song."" When she did take herself seriously before, it was with the socially-aware and in-your-face ""Pieces of You."" But, on the new album, it's all just blah. ""Hands"" is a mind-numbingly generic bit of strumming with a mind-numbingly annoying moral pasted over the top of it. Everything else is just more of the same. Somebody needs to introduce this woman to the heroine of Blondie's ""X-Offender."" Now that was rush!"
1,Spirit? Where?,"Whereas Jewel's debut ""Pieces Of You"" was a classic piece of shimmering folk, this desultory follow-up is almost downright bad. Boring and listless, with some shockingly bad lyrics and laughable arrangements, ""Spirit"" has very, very little. Only 'Deep Water' and 'Absence Of Fear' are memorable, and even they aren't all that good. Once success had gone to Jewel's head, she began to spout pointless pontifications and this is the sad result of too much too soon. She's lost it."
2,Very disappointed in this second album,"After ""Pieces of You""(which I really enjoyed), I was unimpressed by Jewel's second effort. I liked her first album because the lyrics seemed honest. ""Spirit"",on the other hand, seemed like a shallow attempt to appear deep. It seems that everyone has ascribed great spiritual enlightenment and depth to Jewel, looking for multiple meanings and hidden treasures in her songs, when very little exists. She tried too hard with this album, and she bought into her public image. Its a shame.There are a few good tracks on this album, but I cringed every time Jewel reused the metaphor ""fragile flame""--perhaps a thesaurus would help. And was I the only one who was annoyed by her ""Fat Boy"" Song considering she uses the phrase ""A fat man takes my money"" in another song. That would be like putting a song ""Coma Boy"" right next to ""Adrian"" in her first album. I will buy her next album and hope for the best, but after ""Spirit"" I'm not waiting anxiously."
1,zzzzz,PLEASE. This CD has lyrics that don't mean a thing. Boring and predictable. Hopefully third time will be a charm.
1,Disappointing!,"I love Jewel's voice...her CD was disappointing. I felt like I was listening to ONE LONG LONG ballad of a song. There was no diversity in her lyrics and melody -- no true distinct character in each of the songs. The same simple message, ""Love yourself. Don't worry."" Which is nice, BUT I think we got the point. Any case, I felt as though she was hurried and pressured by the media execs and the capitalistic society to bring in another 10 ten hit. I love her and I know she can do a lot better."
1,THE WORST - A NIGHTMARE,"This is truly bad. I mean, Hands is cute, but who wants to hear Jewel, who thinks she is the greatest thing since sliced bread, going on about her stupid hands? Listen,I adore sentimental things (i loved City of Angels) but Jewel thinks she is so deep, and her poetry is so meaningful. And guess what? It's not. Ultimately, this CD is an insult to music"
1,THIS SPIRIT NEVER SHOULD HAVE RESURRECTED,"This artist is definitely not a jewel of any sort. Her songs are peevish and annoying; they lack any sign of creativity or originality and are instead replete with her wallow in self-pity. ""Jewel"" has an overwhelmig querulous nature which is clearly evident in her songs. One star may even be too generous a rating for this album. After a while of listening to this CD, the songs become repetitive, irksome, and boring. This album is not recomended to anyone."
5,Jewel is simple but true,"When I bought Jewel's first album ""Pieces of You"", I was amazed by her talent. She has a great voice, and her songs are not only beautiful, they are also full of meaning. Although her words were simple, the songs still touched my heart in a really special way. With this second album, I was amazed even more since she still creates songs with deep and touching meanings. This time, the songs are extremely meaningful, most of them can really make anyone tremble. ""Spirit"" is a great album not only for Jewel fans but for anyone since it's an album that actually soothes the listener. It's one of those rare albums that you would never get tired of listening to all through out over and over. It's somewhat like a spiritual cure through music"
5,A wonderful album,"I've always been a huge fan of Jewel. I have all of her albums: ""Pieces of You"", ""You Were Meant for Me/Foolish Games"", ""This Way"", ""Joy: A Holiday Collection"", ""0304"", and now my new album is ""Spirit"". I got this CD as an early birthday present from my mom, and I love it. Every song on this CD is beautiful and Jewel's voice is pretty as ever.~~~~~~~~~~Deep Water ~ 5 starsWhat's Simple is True ~ 5 starsHands ~ 5 starsKiss the Flame ~ 5 starsDown So Long ~ 5 starsInnocence Maintained ~ 5 starsJupiter ~ 5 starsFat Boy ~ 3 starsEnter from the East ~ 5 starsBarcelona ~ 5 starsLife Uncommon ~ 5 starsDo You ~ 5 starsAbsence of Fear ~ 5 starsThis Little Bird ~ 5 stars~~~~~~~~~~~Grade: A+++~~~~~~~~This CD is great and I recommend ""Spirit"" to all Jewel fans. Trust me, you WON'T be dissapointed! :)"
4,Very deep and meaningful lyrics,"My school has a retreat every year and we went to a homeless shelter and helped the preschoolers out. They were so cute and all clinged to everyone. Even though they didn't have much, they had alot of love. It made me think. When we got back to the school to reflect on what we thought of the day, they played the song ""Hands."" And when you look deeply into those lyrics and really think about it, we have our own hands and why don't we use them thoughfully and not hatefully? And in the end of this song she sings ""we are gods eyes, gods hands..."" and its almost like she is saying that we have gods features and we should follow his path. She has amazing lyrics and an awesome voice."
3,If Suzanne Vega was 14 years old with a beautiful voice...,"Jewel has a great voice and her music is pretty and earthy. However, her lyrics appear deep but are in fact the trappings of a 14-year-old psyche. This is the kind of verse that my 8th grade teachers hung on the bulletin board as a reward to a clever student. I try not to listen to the lyrics, which goes against my principles, but her acoustic guitar is lovely and she does use her voice to its best.Maybe if someone else could write her lyrics... but then she wouldn't be herself anymore and her music might suffer."
2,Sophmore Jinx,"I want to like this album. The reality is, it's bland, with bad lyrics. Pick up these bootlegs instead - ""unplugged"", ""save the linoleum"", and ""ddelight"". There are over 30 unreleased songs on those 3 CD's that just blow away the ones she chose to put on this album. I hope 3rd time is the charm {although the 1st time was the charm too]"
5,JEWEL IS SO AWESOME!!!!,"I love this CD. I just recieved it and it is truely amazing. ""Pieces of You"" is one of my favorite CDs and I didn't think Jewel could get any better but she has proved me wrong. She's beautiful, talented, and insightful. I'm jelouse."
4,Good Cd.,"I really liked this CD.It's a nice follow up to a very great and successful album,""Pieces of You"". My favorite songs on this are : ""Down So Long"" , ""Deep Water"" , and ""Hands"".I liked ""Pieces of You"" better but I am very satisfied with this CD. I think the songs are written better and have more emotions and are more deep songs.Just like playing an instrument,songwriting to many people is the same,the more you practice the better you get.I think that is what happened with Jewel.These songs seem to have more meaning.I really like Jewel as a singer and a very talented Songwriter.I always have liked people who write there own music and lyrics better than the people who pay for the rights of songs written by other people like most R&B artists do. ~Chris~"
2,Eeek...,"I listened to ""Hands"" on the radio, and while Jewel has grown musically, the lyrics seem to be lines that she pulled from her poems that sounded okay, but really have nothing to do with each other. And she's gained a little bit of an ego after all her success. She says ""we're all okay,"" when I know for a fact that some people are NOT okay. ""My hands are small I know, but they're not yours they are my own,"" I know what she's trying to say, but is it worth it to have huge internal meaning when on the outside it sounds so ridiculous?? ""But they're not yours they are my own,"" Then, to add insult to injury, she repeats it!! She seems to be deliberately simplistic in her lyrics, and her voice is way too nasal. And while some people like all the extra music, I miss the intimacy of her acoustic performances. Sigh..."
5,Hands: I love this song!!,"When I first heard this song I knew that I was going to enjoy it. And to think she was going to quit writing songs. This is one of JEWEL's better songs. It is far better than half of the songs on the PIECES OF YOU album. Jewel shows us, through the use of music, that life can be simple if you don't play spectator and actually involve yourself . I am going to buy this single when it comes out."
1,YUCK!,"All I can say is, a lot of teenage girls must have bought the CD and gushed about it here, because the CD was infantile to say the least! ...unless all the other emotionally immature and simplistic people (in my opinion and I'm not pointing fingers)decided to buy this emotionally immature CD as well! This CD says nothing of where emotions come from. Deep meaning... hah!"
1,This Album Stinks More than Dirty Socks!,"I heard the album, and it's so sickenly sweet, I'm afraid it'll give me diabetes! It's not even a good sweet, like Sarah McLaughlin. It's the underhanded sick kind. Her lyrics are obviously one-dimensional and tells us things we already know! The music style has obviously been changed to fit mainstream. I've heard some of her older work, and I can objectively see the extent of how she's conformed her music to agree with the masses, strictly for monetary reasons. I don't need bad music telling me everything's ok. The world is NEVER ok. What we need is music that makes us stronger. Not melancholy, no matter how lively she TRIES to make her music sound. It's still melancholy. Trust me, if you want to hear GOOD music, pick another CD. A fan, I am definitely not!"
1,Bad,This is no were near as good as her first album. She has become materalistic and shallow. She has become what she hated on her first album.
5,Poetic,"This is my favorite Jewel CD to date. I love how poetic these songs are, and her voice is absolutely amazing.The song ""Hands"" is the reason I purchased this CD to begin with. When I heard it on the radio, it really stuck with me. Especially the part where she asks ""are you gonna save your soul?"". What an important question!All the songs on this CD have great meaning, when you really take the time to listen to them, and I think that's what I like so much about Jewel's music.I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys ""folk-rock"" music, or is looking for lyrics with depth."
4,"Welll, it has some soul...","I'm convinced Jewel ran out of ideas after her debut album. While ""Hands"" is a fabulous song, ""Kiss the Flame"" is not. I love ""Down So Long"" and ""Innocense Maintained"" and think ""Jupiter"" is pleasant, but I would not call it a favorite. While I still highly recommend this, Jewel's debut album is far superior.Bottom line: Jewel is still the best folk singer and both albums are worth buying- to me, anyway."
2,I don't need Jewel to save my soul,"I know that social and political issues are important and all, but when I listen to music I don't necessary want to be reminded about how evil the world is and how all we need is an ""army of faith"" or everything's ""nothing without love."" There are some catchy tunes, but Jewel's social consciousness spoil this album for me on a whole. However, ""Absence of Fear,"" which has nothing to do with social or political issues, almost makes ""Spirit"" worth it for me - it is a beautiful song and I wish the rest of the album was more like it."
4,"Poetic, operatic, and rich with insight and melody","In this, another in her line of outstanding cds, Jewel alternates between the sensitivity and expansionism which has become her hallmark and which demonstrates quite clearly her operatic background. Songs like ""What's Simple is True"", ""Kiss the Flame"", ""Barcelona"", and the soaring ""Jupiter"" remind me far more of John Denver at his best than any performer since. And that's saying something, because Denver of course was as poetic and insightful as any so-called commercial songwriter since maybe Cole Porter."
3,It's decent,"She can sing, that's for sure, and the melodies are decent. But the lyrics? Why does everyone make such a big deal about them? They aren't good. Many are pretty bad. (""What's Simple Is True"", ""Kiss the Flame"", ""Jupiter"", ""Fat Boy"", etc.) As for whether or not she's a good guitarist, nobody really knows, since the music is so simple. (You should see the chords for ""Kiss the Flame"".)If you like decent folk/pop, this is a nice addition to your CD collection. But I'd pick Ani DiFranco over this any day."
5,Just listen to it...,"Sometimes if you put too much effort into analyzing a song, album, or artist, you miss the fundamental point of music - the way it sounds! If you just listen to the album and enjoy Jewel's strong and beautiful voice with simple, yet pleasant musical background, you will be in for a treat. Sometimes you just have to take music at its face value and let your ears do the talking!"
3,Not as good as her first!,"Jewel's new cd, Spirit, is no comparrison to the first. The only good songs on it are Down so long and Jupiter. She over-used the word ""flame"", singing it in at least 5 of her songs. And, honestly, on the first cd, i understood everything she was referring to. Yet in this cd, her lyrics do not go together well or make sense. I'd recommend her first cd, Pieces of You, over this one."
4,"very good,this album has feeling !","the music on this album attracts my attention,she she has grown in her song writing."
4,"Well, well","Jewel certainly put lots of effort into this one. The tunes to most(yes, most)of her songs are soft, and I must say, beautiful. Certainly imcomparable to Foolish Games, no doubt, but you get great ones like Jupiter and Enter from the East.Lyrically, Jewel has deproved greatly. Some of her songs are really sensely, as in the first track, in which has a nice tune is its saving grace. Maybe she has become very poetic and all, so commonfolk like me cannot understand her true messages. So this defies the purpose of meaningful lyrics, doesn't it?This cd makes easy listening on the ear, with her powerful vocals and crisp voice. So if you stop trying to comprehend her lyrics, you will enjoy it."
2,"disappointing.... she lost her""spirit""","I really loved her first album, and I expected her second LP to be so great, but I'm so disappointed... I think she lost her unique spirit. what's wrong? jewel?"
3,It's alright but it could have been better,"Her first album vocally was wonderful but the words showed some signs of immaturity. What I don't like about this new album is that all the songs sound alike. When I first got the album oh my gosh this is so wonderful but once you start listening to a lot you just want to gag because it seems like you are listening to the same song over and over. I think it deserves at least three stars because has shown how much she has grwon since the release of her first album ""Pieces of You"" ."
2,Mediocricity isn't a bad word,"Please, people. Jewel is no genius. She is part of a marketing scheme. Wake up and listen to real music... Hands is a cliche."
2,A major disappointment,"As a huge fan of ""Pieces of You"" I was really let down by Spirit. The music is not all that bad but the lyrics are insipid to the point of naseau. There are a couple of redeeming tracks (my favorite is ""I've been down"") so it rates more than just a single star."
2,I was very disappointed with this album.,"I loved ""Pieces of You"", and I like Jewel's sound... but this album just !*%#@ (except for track 5).Maybe it's just me..."
2,A Step Backwards,"I eagerly anticipated this record's release for months, only to be slightly disappointed when it came. I cannot put my finger on it, but for some reason Jewel's honesty and fragility simply don't translate from Pieces to Spirit. Perhaps it is because she has taken the leap from sympathetic hippie girl to beleagured guru. The music simply doesn't come across as genuine on Spirit."
2,Jewel's voice is a too whiny!,"Jewel's CD is really a disappointment. I liked Hands when I heard it on the radio, but after listening to Spirit, it's clear that Jewel isn't a very good singer. Her voice is very weak; she can't carry notes well. The way Jewel is struggling to sing, it sounds like she's on the verge of passing out - just listening to her makes me squirm. Looks like I'll be passing this CD onto a friend. On the other hand, I absolutely love Natalie Merchant's Ophelia!"
2,Okay,"Jewel is nice, but this work bores me. I prefer her live performances. Look up ""Satellite"" sometime to hear her power and amazing voice."
1,Stay with Pieces!,"Unless of course, you like being told how frail we are and how no one listens to us! Jewel, your voice is heard very clear, why don't you take action instead of complaining about it. I do, and it has a much better response: results."
1,PIECES OF CRAP 2,"A co-worker was playing this CD the other day. It was more than I could take. I bought her a pair of headphones as an early Xmas present. I said, ""If I have to listen to that moronic Jewel CD one more time, I'm gonna go postal!""Jewel has a niche, and it's with the type of faux-folk with a side of naivete that she supplies her fans with. I don't understand the appeal of her, except that chicks who voted for Clinton and defend him must dig it. They seem to be one in the same. Naive, naive, naive - with an unrealistic view of the world and relationships. Nice to dream and have that warble in your voice, Jewel, but it doesn't do it for me."
1,Sooooo Baddddd!!!,"Okay, maybe not painfully bad, but certainly bland, boring, and unimportant. After being forced to listen to both CDs and numerous bootlegged live recordings I have come to realize that Jewel is the pop-consumer equivalent to Tori Amos. Yet again, record labels prove their savvy by tracking down someone who can pass as a semi-clone to a true artist, goose them up, dumb them down and then present said commodity to the masses.Jewel is just another example of what people will buy if it comes their way. Certainly not harmful, but hardly substantive."
1,As bad as her previous release.,"Jewel still sounds like someone without genuine emotion who has been told: ""Sing with more emotion...sing with more emotion...sing with more emotion...sing with more emotion...ad infinitum."" Mannered to the point of being ill-mannered. Jewel, in more than a one song dose at a time, sure makes me ill."
2,Slightly nauseating,"Beautiful voice, but her lyrics range from simplistic to arrogant. ""Hands"" is a lovely song. Unfortunately, the rest of the album fails to measure up."
5,She is unable to disappoint.,"I loved her first album, and the second is, amazingly, even better. Her deep feeling words and flowing voice are an inspiration and a calming friend. There was deep meaning in the first album, and the second goes deeper into the heart and soul. Her music will reach into you as far as you'll let her take you. I very much recomend any of Jewel's works to anyone."
2,If I could tell Jewel 1 thing it would be that her albums OK,"I adored all of Pieces of You. Upon listening to Spirit, there were only about 2 or three songs that had catchy tunes. It was rather a dissapointment because she has definitely changed her all around style."
4,Un disco que da tranquilidad,"Para todos los navegantes de habla hispana quiero recomendarles este disco que nos transporta a otro mundo y nos pone a meditar. Para los que les gusta la musica movida talvez sea demasiado calmado, pero vale la pena tenerlo para momentos en los que uno quiera relajarse y pensar."
2,Muzak Disappointment,"I had high expectations for this CD. I loved Jewel's first CD, having bought it when it was first released, almost 2 years before anyone had heard of her. Her performance at Woodstock showed that she earned her name, being the crowning jewel of the event.Unfortunately, this CD seems to be the sonic equivalent of lukewarm oatmeal. All of the songs sound the same, with little of musical interest. It appears as though Jewel was ""trying"" too hard to seem deep with her lyrics, giving only a passing consideration to the accompanying music.I hope Jewel's next CD can better capture the passion of her first CD and live performances."
4,It's an album that relaxes your body yet stretches the mind.,The mix of songs on this album has a refreshing twist which is Jewel. The lyrics are poetic and the music soothing. Perfect for sitting back and relaxing.
5,Truly Amazing,"Hard to believe, but this album is even better than the first one. Great voice, great lyrics. I love tracks 3,5,7-10, the other tracks are also very good but these are amazing."
2,Too Spiritual,"I'm sick of all these serious, ""earth-first"", love-stricken, spiritual and religious CD's - when will we just have fun music? It's nowhere to be found here. You might find maddingly lifeless songs, overwrought lyrics, and nagging chorus lines. Jewel is going nowhere after she made the big plunge with her 1996 debut."
5,Fabulous!,When I first heard this CD it totally captivated me. There is nothing like it. Every song on the album has such deep meaning and inspires me so much. Whenever I listen to the CD I feel compelled to write myself!
2,wow.,"When I'd bought this cd, the only other jewel album I owned was ""Pieces of You"" (AWESOME by the way). Since i loved her cd so much, i decided to buy her next one with one of my favorite songs on it, Hands. But once i listened to the cd, believe it or not, i only liked 2 songs on the whole cd. (hands and enter from the east) All of her other songs were kind of boring. No beat, nothing but acoustic on most--which is my favorite instrument--but none of the songs touched me at all. I dont think I'll be buying any of her newer cds. Pieces of you was a beautiful cd. I dont know what really happened, but this cd isn't worth any of your money. I'm not even going to waste my time with scoring them. The two songs i liked would rank a 9 and 10. but all the others would probably rank 4 and down."
5,"In this CD, Jewel does not sing her life...she sings yours.","Be aware that when you are listening to Jewel, you are really listening to yourself. She allows you to find yourself by indirectly asking you truth seeking questions that one would normally not think to answer; for example, ""if i could tell the world one thing, it would be...."" By listenting to such songs, you discover yourself more fully by filling in these blanks. You will find things within yourself that you didn't know you had, such as your greatest fault or weakness, or your best quality. By knowing such things of yourself, you more fully become human. You create confidence within yourself, and therefore will be able to see and understand others better. Understand the world. Only then will you be able to ""save your soul"", and consequently, the world."
2,A CZ in the Rough?,"I wanted to like this CD, really. Admittedly, I shouldn't have been so shocked that I didn't, after all I hated the first one. I will say this, though, this album is far better, musically and lyrically, than ""Pieces of You."" But, and this is a big but, she still hasn't outgrown her preachy tendancies. Shying away from all forms of humor and irony, Jewel once again proves that she is not in the forefront of America's premiere singer-songwriters. If you ever wondered what an episode of Oprah would sound like over an acoustic guitar, then this is the album for you. If, however, you're like me and find this idea slightly frightening, skip it and buy something by Elliott Smith instead."
2,More of the same.,"I have great respect for artists who can write and perform their own music. Jewel is a beautiful woman with a beautiful voice, but with these trite lyrics and melodies she should really get some assistance with her writing. I'd like to hear a song by her called ""Screw You All! I Used to Live in a Car!"" or something to break the monotony of her ""cheerfully spiritual"" lyrics. There are some pleasant tunes on this album, but nothing that you can distinguish from anything she's done on this album or her last. I'd love to hear her do some covers of old tunes like ""Natural Woman,"" ""Just One Look,"" etc. Maybe she should team with Layne Staley from Alice in Chains. That would be some pairing and we can get some less perky lyrics. ""Down in a Hole With Jewel."" Actually that would be a rather cheerful experience for me. Never mind...Having said all that, this album will probably sell like hotcakes and please hardcore Jewel fans. I think she is capable of much more."
1,Wimpy packaged music,All of the aspects that made her first Cd great seemed to be missing from this one. Maybe too much fame and money?
5,"I've been moved, that's something I deeply appreciate,","Maturity, introspection, climbing over the hump, breaking the usual mold of follow up recordings, a real artist presents us with something to consider, and leaves us with a longing for a place to capture all that matters."
4,"Overall, a better album than Pieces...","I bought this album, her second, solely on the strength of Pieces of You, and I must say that while I wasn't completely taken aback by the ingenuity of Spirit (I wasn't even expecting to be), it is a quality work. Jewel has updated her music to sound more focused and refined, and this shines through in songs like Down so Long and Deep Water. Spirit is, overall, a much better recording than Jewel's first album, in which I felt that there were only five or six good songs compared to the nine or ten that I like on this album. The additional percussion and backup musicians add a tinge of pop-like wit, but she hasn't lost the innocence that was a focal point and shown through on Pieces of You. Overall, I would most certainly recommend this album to anyone who was a fan of Jewel's first record, for they certainly will not be disappointed."
5,"Tis CD is amaazing. After I heard Hands, I bought its GREAT","WOW! This is Jewel at her best. The songs are meaningful and this is a great CD. I am spending my money on this. Sorry Pop, I guess you'll have to get me something else. This is so good, my Perry Como father, loves it. This shws what a truly great album."
5,I LOVE IT!!,"This CD is the greatest!! Much better than the first. Her music is inspirational. BUY IT RIGHT AWAY, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!! I PROMISE!"
5,Angels on Earth,"Jewel, an angel in a state of melody. A melody which caresses my soul with comforting words. I breath her healing sounds and emotionally float."
5,"A Kick A%# CD Which Surpasses Her ""Pieces of You"" Albumn","i've always been a fan of jewel's, and i was psyched to hear that she has a new albumn. as soon as i put the cd into my player, i couldn't take it out! what an overall terrific cd, which truly captures the message of her music!!! although her ""pieces of you"" albumn was great, this new albumn is phenomonal. which awesome tracks like, ""hands"" and ""deep water"", i can't seem to stop humming jewel songs to myself in my head. what a superb artist! i just hope jewel sticks around in the music industry for a long time to come. we need more artists out there who can completely express themselves in their music, and can still manage to remain the down-to-earth people they were before they became famous. 5 stars all the way!!!"
3,"""Pieces of You"" has more Spirit","Pieces of You is like no other album I've ever heard, and it is great. Spirit just doesn't have, well, the spirit that Pieces of You has. POY was the heart and soul of Jewel Kilcher. She is a very talented and beautiful person, and POY tells her story.Spirit has decent tunes, but most sound very commercial, unlike POY, which has beautiful acoustic only songs that could make the whole world feel spiritual, peaceful, and harmonious. I bought Spirit with the assumption that I would get POY type songs, with a little extra piano or bass, but with Jewels haunting voice nonetheless in the foreground. I haven't quite realized it yet, hopefully, it will grow on me."
5,Fantastic lyrics and instrumental--a must for Jewel Fans,The track titled Jupiter displays Jewel's raw talent and sensuality. The entire CD is filled with suprises and you will want to listen to each track over and over again.
3,Not An Improvement,"A de-provement from the much better ""Pieces of You"" debut both from the standpoint of vocal technique and styling. Jewel didn't like the way she sounded on ""Pieces..."" so she f----- up her technique, much of what she learned in vocal training. Everything is better on the first album - the melodies, the lyrics, everything. Why does she occasionally insist on singing like a 10 year old? She clearly knows how to sing in a mature womanly voice and to get the most out of her voice and vocal technique. But she doesn't, anymore."
3,Sophmore Slump,"What can I say, it just doesn't stand up to Pieces of You. The songs are much weaker, and she seems a bit full of herself. If you saw the VH1 Storytellers she did, I think you know what I'm talking about. It's just not as genuine as we know she can be. And if you're a Flea fan you can skip the disk. His work on ""Barcelona"" is nothing more than ""rooting"" it, and he's buried in the mix."
4,"Good, but not as good as Pieces of You","Some excellent songs on this album, especially Down So Long and Life Uncommen. Some of tracks are poor in relation to Foolish Games but still well worth the money"
2,Compulsively Disgusting,"I really like Jewel's music, the radio play versions. But once I heard her sing in concert, my thoughts were shattered. Jewel should not sing in public or in concert, she is not that great. Her best song ever was on Peices of You, which was ""You were Meant For Me"". Period!"
1,I haven't heard it either,"Let me see now. Two people have only heard one song fromt this CD, another has heard a few in concert, and the fourth really likes the picture on the cover. Could folks try to wait and listen to the whole thing before reviewing it? (though I suppose these reviews would be the same, since preconceived notions seem to be the order of the day) One star just to even things up a little bit."
3,It's Good,"This is a pretty run of the mill album by famous rock star Jewel. Not quite as good as her genre defining This Way or Pieces of You which broke her to the mainstream, but certainly better than Lullaby. Hands of course was the big hit and also appears on Joy. The rest of the album is pretty satisfying easy listening folk type music. One of the best especially modern women in musiic, up there but not as provacative as Madonna. Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase."
1,Stool and spool rhymes with jewel,"How nice to have such a pretty, blond haired girl sing so beautifully. Such an angelic voice. The perfect little poor girl selling love and harmony and hope to people who like watching the Jerry Lee Lewis telethon and hoping that a cure will be found. Telling people exactly what they want to hear in a world that seems anarchaic and spiralling out of control. Extremely manipulative and annoying. Exactly like Geraldo's reporting for CNBC. Especially during the ""crisis"" of Lilleton, Colorado. With Jewel playing the soft, cotton-candy background music. Hold onto her hand and walk through lollipop land. With her voice guiding you to let go, not worry and walk around saying what a swell day it is. Her voice is also telling you to let go of your money. I know better though, and so do other people."
2,This CD sucks really bad!!,"Spirit is the worst CD I have listened to all year. All of the songs make no sense, and the only one worth listening to is ""Hands"". This song is pretty weak though so that is not saying much for the CD. Do yourself a favor and buy her first CD ""Pieces of You"". It is much better, and you can actually listen to every song without skipping over them."
5,Jewel has done it again!,"I thought Jewel's Pieces of You was good but her Spirt was the best. I loved this album. She expesses everyday feelings and very deep feelings on a mixture of topics. The tunes, the words, and the feelings in these songs are wonderful. At the end of the album she even sings a song with her mother. Listening to her songs and poetry touches my heart!!"
5,THE BEST CD OF THE YEAR,"JEWEL'S NEW CD HANDS IS UPLIFTING,INSPIRATIONAL,SOOTHING,& JUST ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL BEGINING TO END . HER BEST WORK YET.IF YOU LIKED HER OTHER CD'S I HIGHLY RECOMMED YOU GET THIS ONE."
5,the reason its good:,"I know one thing -- and that is this: JEWEL IS HOT. Tres hot, as they say in france. Mucho hot, as they say in Mexico. HOT HOT HOT. And that is why she is so good. That's why she is so famous. But I think she's a pretty good singer too -- and I'd think she was an even BETTER singer if she sang in the nude."
2,A homogeneous album,"All songs on her new CD sound the same. No upbeat songs in this album. Only ""Deep water"" and ""Hand"" are standout and the rest of the album are lullaby that are good for insomnia treatment."
3,Sweetly Moving...,"I bought the CD because I love Jewel's beautiful voice. Usually I don't listen to all of the songs on CDs that I buy...for some reason, I do not have the patience. However my friend suggested a few songs in the CD to listen to and I was really struck by the song, ""Absence of Fear"". It makes you realize that ""fear"" does hinder a lot of us in moving forward....I am getting way too deep. :) But I love her beautiful voice, if you listen to it with no conviction, it inspires and sometimes even heals the hurt that everyone experiences. Music was meant for pleasure and entertainment....just let it in. :) P.S. I love that little bird song...:)"
5,Total and complete beauty and inspiration!,"As a singer myself, Jewel's music has inspired me ever since I bought her first album! I have to admit..Spirit is much better than the first album..but her lyrics are mind grasping! I have learned so much from her! Her concert was absolutely breath-taking! I wish all the best of luck to Jewel in her future! Love you Jewel!"
4,Hands and feet,"I really do like this album, but I have to say I loved her first album ""Pieces of You"" much better. But, that aside, this is still a very good album. Two of the songs, ""Fat Boy"" and ""Enter from the East"" are great songs that don't include the band that features on the rest of the album. The hit song ""Hands"" has an important and worthwhile message to it, as does ""A life uncommon"". Jewel is a great talent, a wonderful singer/songwriter, and even though I personally don't think this as brilliant as her debut, (I'd give it 4 and a half stars if I could), it is still a worthy album to add to your collection. The 20 page booklet includes lyrics and photos, including 2 very ""interesting"" photos of Jewel's feet! Go figure!"
3,Spirit Spirit is an inspirational CD.,Spirit is an inspirational CD. The poetry is amazingly beautiful and touching. The hit song hand's is truly the best song on the CD. I recommend this for ages 13-100. This is definitely Jewels best work yet.
2,"no hearts on sleeves, please","this album is not my thing - i recognize that she is a talented individual - but I want something that is more edgy, trashy, and insincere. I prefer to read between the lines instead of reading someone's heart on their sleeve"
5,It leaves you SPEECHLESS!!,"Overall this album is incredible. Every song has wonderfully well versed lyrics and gorgeous melodies sang by the gorgeous voice of Jewel.I have listened to this album since it came out up to this point, and through all the years, It's one of the only albums that has stood that test of time. It's a masterpiece.Jewel is wonderful, Get this album, and give it time to appreciate it. Because like any good love, it grows on you more and more each day.Bravo Jewel!"
5,"Very deep, poetic and spiritful at the same time","This is the first Jewel's album that I bought. At 1st,I didnt like it, but then I found the depth of the album. She's simply a very poetic woman, yet also critical. I love almost the entire tracks but I love :""Hands""--deep! I LOVE IT!""Down So Long""--My 2nd fave""Abscene of Fear""--wonderful""Do You""""Life Uncommon"" // ""Jupiter""// ""This Little Bird""--her mom's song is very smoky!!!.Why Nedra wasn't being a singer?."
4,Pretty good up to the end,"I really like the beginning of this cd, but it fizzles toward the end. The track with her mother just killed the ending for me."
1,Absolutely Awful,"I'm not normally one to rant, but this software is simply and truly terrible. The discs include one 470 MB executable - I don't know what they were thinking - which takes even my brand new, state of the art Dell forever to load.The interface is terrible, random, and confusing. There is no help in getting started - no printed manual - and little rhyme or reason to what's going on.Stay away at all cost! Garbage!"
1,Don't waste your money,"There must be no toner in this cartridge. Or just enough to get 1 week past the return window. This has lasted for 4 weeks. A complete waste of money. Sometimes what seems like a good deal, isn't."
1,Not an adequate replacement,"While I am typically in favor of generic products and believe they offer an overall better value than comparable branded products, this isn't it. The typical HP cartridge runs me $70 and lasts me 6-9 months (printing Word documents on a regular basis), this one was $14 but only lasted about 3 days before the ink began to fade. Within a week, it needed replacement."
2,The New Madrid earthquake.,"Well, this book had the premise of being a very good, fascinating account of the New Madrid earthquake. The first chapter of the book even starts out with a account of what happened. Then it starts talking about the theory of predictions, why earthquakes happen, why this one might have happened. It was pretty evident that two authors wrote this book. This book goes in all sorts of directions, but the actual one in which it was supposed to go.Unlike other books, this one was was not smooth and was hard to follow. Even though it was a short book, it took twice as long to read as one considerably thicker but more interesting. I also doubt it is the definitive history of this early American earthquake."
5,"A Beautiful, Informative, Fun book","A terrific book. The illustrations are beautiful and the pictures of the author's wearable art are inspirational. What I like is that the technique sounds do-able. Even with limited sewing skills, I feel that this is something I can tackle and be creative at. One thing that I liked was that there is so much information in this book. It's not about making one thing. It's about learning techniques you can use in other kinds of sewing. What was really interesting was the section on the elements that make a design work. I haven't seen that before. Just looking at the book is a real treat."
1,What a disappointment,"All the positive reviews of this book won me over, and I bought it.Let me tell you that unless you are a suburban/rural housewife/preschool teacher who likes to wear ""art"" vests, you may not get much from this book. I recommend The Art of Manipulating Fabric instead. I strongly believe that the people who wrote the previous reviews must be friends of the author."
1,Tips from the Golden Girls,"I am scratching my head on why this book got so many good reviews. After ordering about 15 books on topics ranging from quilting to fabric manipulation to sewing, I can honestly say this book is the biggest waste of time I've ever seen. It contains ideas that no self respecting woman would ever put to use in a clothing project. Almost every ""idea"" is a horribly shaped vest. A VEST!! Who even wears a quilted type vest after about 1985 unless they are 70 years old? Stay away if you are looking for anything even remotely up to date or usefull. If on the other hand, you are making something for an elderly woman, this is your book!"
5,Inspiring,Rosemary Eichorn has written a comprehensive book on her fabric collage techniques. The book is organized and thorough and it's possible to make your own collages following her well-written instructions. Photos are also excellent.
5,Free motion primer,"After searching through all my other books on free motion quiltingand thread painting, I flipped through this and found exactly whatI needed to get started. I had to grow into needing this book asI bought it when I began making art quilts. If you're not sure how to goabout making quilted cloth for clothes etc then this book will get youwell into the process. Excellent reference book!"
4,Lots of interesting train viewing,"My train-loving sons have really enjoyed this video. They like the Big Train portions best---especially seeing the inside of an Amtrak and seeing the newest commuter rail model. My only problem with this video---why do the writers of such videos give the child actors such annoying lines? They are good actors, but are made to constantly say lines like ""I want that!"" when they see anything train related, and to ask everyone for a hamburger, etc. If they were just allowed to act like the natural train lovers that kids are, I think it would be more realistic and enjoyable! But it's still a very enjoyable video."
5,Big Trains Little Trains,I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old. They both love the DVD - Big Trains Little Trains. My kids can watch it over and over again without getting tired of it.
3,Haven't received it yet,"Review of the product would be good, since I have used it previously, but the last order still hasn't arrived, and is long overdue."
5,Great . I have been waiting for the total CD.,"I had the opportunity to meet Shane a few months ago when he was just starting. He came back to Syracuse for a listener appreciation night and I brought my son and very pregnant daughter. He was great everyone loved him. Even my unborn grandaughter. Shane came back again to Syracuse to open for Alabama, he kept blowing the speakers but we all loved him anyway. Will run out and buy the CD when it is available. Remember I knew you when. I wish him lots of luck."
5,Made for control work,"I bought these after using my colleagues at work. They are made to strip SINGLE wire at a time. The other review for this product, it looked like the person tried stripping multi-conductor cable. That is in fact not what these do best. If you are like me, and work in a field like automation or controls, these are awesome. Sharp blades, fast stripping. You don't have to locate the right hole and fidgit with the wire like you do with traditional strippers."
1,LOOKS PROMISING BUT DISSAPOINTING,"This will be my first review on Amazon so I must say it is not a good reason I am doing this. This products looks and been hipped up to be promising but it is a complete failure for me. I tried to stripped a 14-2wg and I could not stripped the wire and the worst thing the thing came with no instruction or picture on how to use the product. I regret buying this product, a waste of my money. It would be easier to just use a blade to strip the wire instead of using this tool."
2,Not my favorite,"I'm not sure if vitamin B-6 has to be taken under the tongue. I'm sure it absorbs more quickly this way. I don't mind that so much, but these taste pretty funny and they take a while to melt."
2,Yuck,"I bought this product because of an Obstetricians recommendation. She said you can take this to resolve nausea when it's present, not a prevention of nausea. I puked immediately from the taste! It is gritty and chemical taste after the initial mint flavoring goes. This product, I'm sure suits other needs, but DONT use this to combat nausea!"
5,still good,I first read this book when I was in school-a while back. Caldecott tells such a good story you believe it could happen this way. Kyra and the other characters feel real. Also good versus evil is always interesting. Worth reading if you like historical fiction.
5,Good,"This book was very good, but I knew from the beginning of the book what happens because I have read lot of Stine books and know his style. Still, it was great!"
1,Hulkalooser,"Bad acting, Bad dialogue, bad effects bad everything.In this film nothing made me happy, it was the worst film ever.It was on a sunny sunday when i was watching BBC1, all i could see was a fantastic movie which turned out to be a no point watching film, Hogan couldnt bearly act and Grace jones was the worst in it, you could tell her age was going on...."
2,Dissapointing,"I had hoped to hear good renditions of the great music of George Gershwin. Instead, the orchestrations were poor and the choice of singers were incredibly inappropriate. Hence, this was a disappointing disc. Only a very few of his songs were presented to my liking."
1,Sad recordings of fine music,"Unfortunately, all of the 'artists' recorded on these discs feel that their listeners would be bored listening to these pieces as Gershwin wrote them. So, almost EVERY number has been individualized. This is very distracting. Some numbers are hardly recognizable. And how could they distort and ruin Rhapsody in Blue? But they did.I'm very sorry I bought this album."
5,The Best Album Since Ever!!!!,"I never knew who Gershwin was until I saw the 7th Heaven episode where they did a tribute to his music. I thought the music was interesting, so I decided to try a cd. I heard Rhapsody in Blue when I was a child.(the second half) I am always looking for a great artist and someone I feel is deserving of listening to. I'm proud to say that after I bought this album and listened to it, I am truely a Gershwin fan. And with me getting married soon, this was the best time to get introduced to his music because Embraceable You is definitely the most perfect song ever."
5,Gershwin,essential is a great title for this CD. Wish they made them like him still. True classics that will live longer than me.
2,Only Two or Three Songs stand out....,"I didn't care for this CD. The only cuts that have any merit are ""Burning Memories"", ""So Wrong"" and ""The Violet and the Rose"". I don't care for Pam Tillis' contemporary arrangements on ""Honey, Open that Door"" and I especially did not like her take on ""Heart Over Mind"". This CD is overproduced with the Nashville contemporary sound that makes it into ""bubble gum country"" except for the three songs that I mentioned at the beginning of this review."
2,it's nashville,"it is ""Burning Memories"" which opens the ball.Excellent.The continuation is not same gauge.Especially listened to the album before buying it.After an attentive listening, one surprises oneself to like another title that one liked not inevitably before.In homage to MEL TILLIS, one expected a traditional product,it is not the case.It is especially the print of the current sound of Nashville which planes on this Cd.too bad!!!c'est ""Burning Memories"" qui ouvre le bal.excellent.La suite n'est pas du mme calibre.Ecouté surtout l'album avant de l'acheter.Après une écoute attentive,on se surprend à aimer un autre titre qu'on aimé pas forcément auparavant.En hommage à MEL TILLIS,on s'attendait à un produit traditionnel,il n'en est rien.C'est surtout l'empreinte du son actuel de nashville qui plane sur ce cd.Dommage!!!"
3,A Few Good Tips,There were some good tips in this book. Gary and Dennis go over all of the commands but don't explain many of them. The book is still worth getting. I found it more helpful than Roger Toogood's book.
1,Useless,"This book is useless and it covers nothing that is written in the index. If you want a good book, buy Kelley's Pro/Engineer Instructor."
5,Great Resource,An Excellent Reference for Pro/E Users on any level. Provides the reader a good understanding of Pro/E's capabilities and functions. A must have for any serious Pro/E user.
4,Bedside Manners,I just finished reading this great new thriller. It was a page turner and it took me through much of what a poor intern has to go through. I felt so sorry for Danny and he was so real to me I was ready to make him some chicken soup. I enjoyed his humor and feelings about life in general. Good book. Hope there is more coming from this new author.
4,Structural Geology,"Chock-full of instruction concerning the ""architecture"" of the the Earth and its processes. An excellent addition to any Earth science collection."
3,Really?,"I just took structural geology this semester. This book was little or no help at all. I am giving it 3 stars, since my teacher said that it's the best structure book out there. He even admitted that it wasn't very helpful. I used it maybe 5 times this semester. Honestly save your money or write a better book."
2,Disappointing.,"I was very disappointed in the quality of the disc. The first 10 minutes were unwatchable. It was like trying to watch a scrambled programme on T.V. However, after that the first and second acts were fine until the finale when the disc just stopped. I was able to start the finale again from the disc menu after which it played through to the end. From what I was able to watch I think it would have been very enjoyable but was, of course spoiled. I have not been able to watch the PAL side so cannot comment on it."
4,WON DERFUL VERSION OF THIS BEAUTIFUL BALLET.,"THE CORP THE BALLET DANCES IN A HIGH LEVEL, AND IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE ALESSANDRA FERRI STILL DANCING IN GOOD FORM . BALANCHINE""s COREOGRAPHY SINTETIZES VERY WELL SHKESPEAR!S PLAY, AND THE SLECTION HE MADE OF OTHER MUSIC OF MENDELSSHON MATCHES PERFECTLY WHITH THE INCIDENTAL MUSIC HE WROTE FORMERLY"
1,Defective inventory?,"As others have commented, the NTSC side of this DVD is non-playable. I tried it in two DVD players and they refused to play it. I then tried it in my PC, and only the PAL side of the DVD works. The NTSC side contains nothing but the color test bars you see when a TV station is off the air. I think Amazon has got a batch of bad DVDs here.I'd really like to have this DVD for my daughter who loves ballet - and from viewing the PAL side of the DVD, the picture quality and sound appear superb. Giving it 1 star solely because the DVD was defective."
2,Not waht I expected,I thought this was the play with incidental music.Wrong!It's all ballet!Donkeyhead dances.
3,"Grizzly hose reel 1/4""","It's OK for the price.I wish Grizzly to offer a little longer hose.Hose stop is not precise. sometime it engages well, other times had to try few times.Monunting bracket needs an improvement."
4,"Oh, don't get so shirty about it","Paul Johnson has one of the most delightful and witty writing styles of anyone moshing about in the pitifully small pond which constitutes the modern pool of English belles-lettres. I agree that his essays are not marvels of insightful erudition ala Hazlitt, but, heck, they certainly are much more entertaining than almost all of the other ""tosh"" that is drifting about. He's certainly a fuddy-duddy, along with Winston Churchill, Edmund Burke, G. K. Chesteron, Ezra Pound, Hilaire Belloc, and a bunch of other cranky pen-peddlers. So what? Oh, if only we had more such alive today who could actually write in a memorable manner."
5,Brilliant,"Easily one of the best albums of 2002. Dharma's music swirls and transcends, lifting the listener up, making them feel like they are a part of something bigger than just themselves. A smooth blend of post-hardcore indie rock that will easily please fans of bands like Sunny Day Real Estate, Hot Water Music, and Sparta. Do yourself a favor and own this."
4,Great book for educators,"This book is very helpful to any elementary teacher that is looking for ways to improve your reading curriculum. Lucy Calkins gives plenty of ideas and new approaches to try in your classroom. I also appreciate how she writes the actual scenario she used in the classroom with real kids. It is so much easier to comprehend through real life experiences. Another book that is similar, very informative and full of GREAT ideas is Reading Essentials by Regie Routman. This is a must read as an educator."
1,What a Sad Author,"It's unfortunate that some authors use children's education as a venue for underhanded business practice. I feel that theory on education should be based on teaching experience, not (other people's experience and...) what sells. Unfortunate but true, which is why this book was read once, and left on a dusty shelf with the other duds."
5,Best 5ive song ever!,"I love this song so much! It was only released in America, and I so wish it was released here in New Zealand. The American radio edit is way better then the version on their CD. ""Don't U Want It"" is great too. Buy this single!"
5,it was the best!scott is the hottest thing ever and ILUVHIM!,I THINK SCOTT IS WAY HOT AND IF I GOT A CHANCE TO MEET HIM I THINK I'D KISS HIM RIGHT THEN AND THERE!!! THEY ARE WAY BETTER THAN ANYOTHER BAND I'VE EVER HEARD! THEY SURE CAN SLAM DUNK ME IF THEY WANT TO!!:)SCOTT IF YOU READ THIS....ILOVE YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART AND I AM INFATUATED WITH YOUR ACCENT.
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I love horses and I am always searching for fiction that oozes anything equestrian. This is NOT that book. There is no horse story,love story or anything remotely interesting about the main character.I am sorry to be so blunt but this was a complete waste of money. Better to buy ""Like Water for Elephants"" or ""Life of Pi"" .....both delightful reading experiences for animal lovers!"
5,Hearts Over Fences,"An excellent book with well researched details of the equestrian world. Riveting, exciting, and with an excellent insight into therapeutic riding."
3,Mixed Review,"I'm an avid reader and hunter/jumper rider. The bottom line is that I enjoyed the horse elements of the book but thought the romance part was lame. The romance plot elements are very trite and cliche and utterly predictable. You could certainly see the finish line from the starting box, so to speak. A bit like a Grand Prix jumper riding a crossrails course. I'm trying to think of more to say about the book, but that's really all there is to it, it isn't exactly complex."
3,Fairly predictable romance novel,"If you have read any Mills and Boons romance novels then you will find the style of this book very familiar. It is an easily readable but by no means compulsive novel. There are just enough horses in the story to keep the horse mad reader interested but this is by no means a book primarily about horses. Think of the horses as the back drop for a typical romance - girl meets boy, the usual long list of reasons for them not to be together and ultimately love overcomes all. An enjoyable read with out having any lasting effects."
2,Cute if you're not expecting much.,"If you're a horse lover then you will like this story. It's a fun, unchallenging read, however, it's contrived, cliche, and Miss Leland has no confidence whatsoever in her reader's intelligence. Everything is pointed out to you, ""She smiled because she was so happy,"" etc. The plot leaves something to be desired as well as most of the book is Beth and Conner ""Brett"" Hall, continually rehashing how much they like eachother and want to have sex with one another, with little else going on except the random accidents that are supposed to suffice as plot twists. Personally, I'm tired of equestrian fiction being held to a lower standard of writing than the basest high school novel. The Saddle Club has more interesting story lines than this book."
5,Another great equestrian romance,"In her latest equestrian romance, Toni Leland creates two appealing characters who have the ability and perseverance to chase big dreams. Ambitious, competitive, and goal-driven, both Beth Webb and Connor Hall try to conquer every obstacle to achieve big things. The trouble is, they are also hiding the truth, about themselves--and worse, FROM themselves. Set in Kentucky horse country, the novel is fast-paced and educational. Anyone who loves horses, business, or romance will enjoy this quick and interesting read. I recommend ""Hearts Over Fences"" as well as her other novel, ""Winning Ways""."
5,Dance Like Nobody's Watching,"Marion Rosen's heart-warming book, ""Dance Like Nobody's Watching,"" is a revelation to the power of the human spirit and the strength of love in overcoming life's obstacles. She faced the awesome fear of two dreaded cancers to live victoriously.After reading Marion's book, I am struck by the old truth that it is more important how you live--not how long! She also gives detailed practical advice to those faced with enduring the medical trials necessary in the fight against this cruel disease.Marion, just keep on dancing!"
5,A Book To Read Again,"""Dance Like Nobody's Watching"", what a positive and uplifting book. As I closed the book after reading about Marion's positive experiences and how she was always there for those who needed her, I felt a big warm hug from my dear friend and colleague. This is a book that I will read more that one time."
2,horror rises from the tomb,"ONE OF NASCHYS MOST BRUTAL AND ENTERTAINING EFFORTS,THIS PLAYS LIKE A GORE VERSION OF THE '50S FAVORITE THE THING THAT COULDN'T DIE."
4,Good for your joints,"Since I'm in my early '60's I've started to have aching and painful joints. My GP recommended glucosamine (1500 mg/day). He pointed out that there is really no harmful side effect, and that most people see some improvement. After reading some more through sites I found on Google, I decided that the other additives often included with glucosamine were not beneficial, so I looked on Amazon for a product that didn't have more additives and that was priced right. These folks had the best in that category, with the additional benefit that with the capsules being 750 mg I can have one in the morning and one in the afternoon to balance my consumption over the day. I've noticed a reduction in the pain I used to have, so it certainly seems to be worth it."
2,Contains KCI,"The next few sentences come from the glucosamine arthritis webpage. When looking at the ingredients on the back of the bottle, this product does contain KCI.""avoid glucosamine sulfate * NaCL (or KCl) (or if the ingredients list says potassium or salt after the sulfate). Some companies are very tricky about this""This product does not seem to work as well as I'd hoped so I asked my doctor if he could recommend a Glucosamine. He said some of his patients found relief from Dr. Whitakers Joint Essentials. They do carry this product through the Amazon site so I'll try a bottle and report through that product review."
2,Not very good,I have tried many L'Occitane products and this was the first disappointment it does nothing for the hair except when left on but it only acts as an overpriced gel.
4,"Fun, more for adults","This is so enjoyable, especially for the mix of performers. I expect a kid would like it, but like all the best children's stories, there's something that the parents will find amusing in every track. Of course, anything with Kevn Kinney is worth the price of admission. I'm glad to own it."
3,Already broken,"I bought this for a trip to Europe in April 2010 and was really pleased with it...until last month, when all of a sudden, the ""high"" button just stopped working. My purchase was made through Amazon from a company called ""Shear Up."" I got it for a very good price and there seems to be a one-year warranty from the manufacturer. But they want $19 and won't take checks. The whole thing is pretty ridiculous. I've written to ShearUp and we'll see what they say. I used to have a Conair which lasted me 10 years. Now this fancy one couldn't even make it a year?? I am disappointed."
5,Another great bio-ionic product,"Bio-ionic hair care products are the best. My hair tends to dry out with any other type of styling iron, dryer, etc. than those made by Bio-ionic. I have had 2 flat irons, 2 curling irons and 2 hairdryers. I love them all and they all still work. This hairdryer fold so ingenuously that I love the design and its easy to pack. I never risk the hotel having a decent dryer, etc. anymore, I just take my own."
2,Not good for thick hair,"I bought this for travel and the dual voltage feature. It was OK for that but it did a very slow job of actually drying my hair, which is not quite shoulder length and on the thick side. It's like it overheats constantly and the speed is automatically reduced, which significantly adds to drying time. It does this regardless of whether I am in Europe or in the US. This did keep working for about 3 years before I just stopped using it, but the performance was far below my expectations for the price. Also there is no heat setting, which is also weird considering the price."
4,Not what exactly what I wanted,"Size is ok, weigh is ok, but I was looking for a travel hair dryer that would be at leas 1800 watts. The information on Amazon wasn't very accurate, so I just picked the cheappest one but there was no information about watts, and it happens to be a 1200 watts, with just hot air, no option for cold air. It tends to warm up very quickly."
3,Not bad for a Cannon movie,"As stated before, this movie is loosely adapted from the Elmore Leonard novel 52 Pick-up. Robert Mitchum plays U.S. ambassador Peter Hacker trying to bring peace to the Middle East who is blackmailed by the Palestinians. Rock Hudson (in his last role) is Hacker's head security officer and plays his role excellently and Ellen Burstyn plays Hacker's wife Alex. Let me just cut to the chase. The action scenes are actually cheese-free unlike other films from the Cannon Group (Chuck Norris, I'm talking to you). The storyline is very suspenseful and the acting is first-rate. As stated in another review, Ellen Burstyn has the most memorable scene in the movie with a topless dance for her lover and a rather steamy bed scene. I believe she was in her early 50s during this movie and let me just say WOW! I first saw this when I was 16 and she was also the main reason I kept watching it. It's too bad that this has never made it to DVD. Check it out!"
3,pretty good,"I have seen the film a couple of times, and though parts of it were a little cliched, it was generally quite enetertaining.(I also was an ""extra"" a press photographer, in the hospital scene, so naturally, I think that 20 second sequence is superb !)"
1,"you have to buy this book, literally","The only way to get the most up to date version of QT Non-Commercial for Windows is to buy this book. That is absolutely shameful. That is the only reason why most people would buy this book. If you want to develop free, open source applications that work on any platform - then you have to pay Trolltech if you want to use the newest version of QT according to their license. I understand their motivations (getting people to migrate to Linux, and making more profit for themselves), but it just means people are migrating to wxwidgets, gtk+, java, and .NET instead."
2,I'm glad my company bought the book because it's a waste,"I'm glad my company bought the book and I didn't waste my own money on it. I'm back looking for a better book now. Writing style is terse. Very scant operational discussion about what is going on behind the scenes with UIC and MOC. The only reason I gave two stars is because I did use one of the examples in the book for production use, heavily modified. Otherwise the book is dry, humorless, and uninspiring. Buy it only if you are using someone else's money."
2,eh,"The hangers are made out of solid wood, but the rods are loose and fall out. Other than that, the product is as expected."
2,expected more,Very good book for the beginner but be aware that the faces on some of the modelled pieces were poorly executed.
5,great memory upgrade,"I installed this 256MB DIMM in a new Sony 1.8 GB VAIO desktop, which came with 256MB RAM - which should have given me 512MB, but when I started the machine up... I started getting an error sound-code, so I shut down the system. I had tried installing the Viking DIMM in the #2 slot ... since this failed I tried removing the original DIMM from the #1 slot and installing the new DIMM in it's place. I moved the Sony DIMM to #2 and re-booted. This time the Sony came to life and registered 512MB.The Viking DIMM is a great product and has vastly improved the Sony's performance."
5,"Great memory, amazing price",I installed this memory and it worked right off. Not a single problem. I plan to buy 3 more just to give me an even 1 gig of memory.
5,It's RAM. It does what it needs to do.,"I haven't had any problems with it, it does what it needs to do, so i guess it's good!"
1,Incomplete ad,I wanted to order 3 of this item your ad says nothing about limited quanties if i wanted to max my pc ram I need 3 256 boards so i cannot use just one
4,Adam Broner's book about World War II,"Adam Broner's book is a well-written, very readable one person's story of the most important event of the 20th century, World War II. It is a remarkable, I would even say unique story. At that turbulent time, most people let themselves be pushed where the changing fates of war were throwing them. Not so the young Adam Broner. He repeatedly made his own decisions, sometimes risky but right and courageous. The most important of these was to desert the ""working battalions"" in Siberia, and to join the army fighting the Nazis. It may sound strange, but Adam Broner's story is also unique because it tells the plain truth. He has not adapted his narrative to the now prevalent ideas. Broner simply tells us how it was. A good book. Richard Fenigsen, M.D., Waltham, Massachusetts."
2,Undigestible Opinion,"256 pages long, and read in 1992, this book reveals that there are six ways we make personal choices that shape our lives. They are the value systems based on authority, logic, sense experience, emotion, intuition, and science. While Lewis writes an interesting chapter on Montaigne and some deft criticism of cognitive psychology, this book is, on the whole, overstuffed with undigested and undigestible opinion, contradictory and confusing opinion. It is not a logical book but a salad and Christian Conservatism is the salad dressing.Outside of a few interesting remarks, this book is not worth the cost of its printing."
5,Life's never black & white for a hermaphrodite.,These guys are awesome! This is 100% pure punk rock. DRINK UP
2,Not As Fun As It Looks,"It's cute and colorful, but, for the money, it doesn't do alot. It should've been priced in the mid-twenties. It only makes the one sound. And, my biggest complaint of all, is storage. My two and a half year old son received this toy for Christmas, and, now that it's time to move it to the basement I am dismayed that it does not self store like the farm and other Fisher Price toys do. We have the one ""with Accessories"" that includes a little dragon nest and fencing, and there is no where to put any of these parts. So, I know the parts will be lost in no time. If your child has just one toy, great. If you have LOTS of toys, expect the farmer to live in the castle and the king to be off carousing on a carousel somewhere."
3,Prefer the 70's Playskool castle...,"I was very excited to buy this toy for my son since I had a castle made by Playskool in the 70's. Boy, was I disappointed. My son liked it okay, but he had more fun with the expansion packs that included more horses, people, and especially Robin Hood's tree fort. The castle sections barely stay open, there's only a few places that each piece can fit, and there's not much room to move the characters around. There's only one ""animated"" piece along with the same sound effect each time. I had to work hard to keep him interested (when he was 1yr and even now that he's 3yrs). Overall, I was very disappointed."
2,Not as fun as the doll house,"We got this for my one year old son because he loved playing with his big sister's doll house from the same line of toys. The doll house has a variety of sound effects, which was his favorite part of playing with it. However, the castle only has one effect - when you press on the flag, the king's chair swings around while a trumpet sound plays - that's it. My son continues to play with the doll house and my daughter uses the castle for her Disney princess figurines, so I guess everyone is happy anyway!"
3,Kingdom Castle review,"My grandaughter just loves this Castle, however I do not think that they sell enough accessories. Although I purchased everything that was available , I found you could not buy additional fences etc. I was able to purchase through E-bay additional fences which make a great court yard."
3,KIND OF KLUNKY,"While I must admit it is cool to have five different ninjas to play with,the platform is quite janky. It falls apart and by no means will this toy ever bea collectible."
1,As Bad as the Real Reality Shows!,"Jocasta Perry is a female playboy. She adopts the ""love 'em and leave 'em"" attitude towards men, which seems to fit into her hectic and hip life as a TV producer in London. She comes up with a new reality show called ""Sex with an Ex"" and things take off. Then, she meets Darren Smith, who refuses to be a contestant on the show and her world is turned upside down. The girl who never gets attached finds herself in love, in denial, in pain, and finally, stabbed in the back by her production assistant in a plot involving Darren.Cheesy - with a side of Velveeta to boot. Issie is predictable, Fiona is horrible, Bales is a stereotype, Darren is unrealistic and basically retarded to keep coming back. Josh is a puzzle turned pathetic with the whole marriage proposal and Cas is a true moron. 33 year olds have NO excuse to act the way she does. Not to mention the boring, descriptive pages on Whitby and the Museum. Garbage!!!!"
1,PURE CRAP,I thought that this would be a good book. I WAS WRONG!! It is so horrible and boring that I couldnt get past the first 50 pages. The characters are dull and over done. The writer I THINK is trying too hard to make them cool. They just remind me of rip offs of other characters i have read about a thousand times before. I suggest that NO ONE waste their money on this book. And if this author has anymore books out then I dont think I would suggest buying them either. If they are anything like this piece of crap.
2,have to get past the first 100 pages,"The beginning of this book was very slow and the ending ws predictable. The author spent too much time on the set up of the characters. There are only so many ways you can say someone is mean, and selfish. Once Darren was introduced the story got better."
2,The image is not clear and detailed.,This book is not good enough for a parent to teach kids playing. Its image is too old and not clear. It is very difficult for you to learn how to grip the racket for example by seeing the pictures in this book.
2,Dated Book Needs Reworking,"I was very disappointed in this book when I received it. There has been a lot more development in getting children interested in tennis than this book reveals. The production values of the book in terms of text, photographs and graphics are somewhat primitive. Pierce Kelley is a great guy, dealing with a topic he really loves, but he needs to get more help on communicating this in an effective way. Tennis has evolved tremendously since he grew up in Florida, but you would not know it from this book. There is a lot more gold left in this mine for Pierce or someone else to bring out."
1,Rewrite the book!,"If you are a complete beginner, than this book is suitable for you - however, if you know nothing about tennis, you shouldn't teach your children to play it.Described strokes in the book are old-fashioned, not recommended by ITF and at least 15 - 20 years old. Lendl would have such gameplay, Nadal not."
4,truckin' songs,"if you like truck driving songs like we do, this is a good mix of some of his best tunes"
5,Best shirt ever!,"I have several of these shirts that I wear all the time. Not only are they comfortable and stylish, they are also practical, with more than enough pocket space for phones, passport, wallet, pens, even boarding passes. This is now my ""travel shirt"" that I wear any time I fly. Now I always have my pen, wallet and phone within reach, plus there's the hidden pockets where I keep my passport and boarding pass. The hidden pockets are big enough to securely conceal my entire boarding pass without folding it."
4,NX73v is a slight upgrade from the previous nx series,"The only thing that made me upgrade to this nx73v from my nx60 was the Decuma handwriting input. It is by far the best input software and I have been a graffiti user for 5 years. I thought I was fast on graffiti, but with decuma, I can write more naturally and much more quickly. Sony does it again."
4,Glad I Upgraded,"Previous happy owner of a Clie NR60 but had to upgrade when I dropped it and broke the screen. The NX73 has everything I liked about my previous machine and in addition is Faster, has better screen resolution, and the Upgraded Palm OS. The Decuma handwriting recognition is great. The more I use it the more I like the ablity to take notes in my writing. The camara is lame and not a reason to buy this machine. The option for using CF cards is great plus in flexibility and cost. If you like to type your notes into your PDA, then this machine is not for you. The touch of the keyboard gives barely enough feedback. The Tungsten C has much better keyboard feel if you feel this is important. Bottom Line, if you like the big screen of the CLIE clamshell models (which to me makes a big difference), this is definitely the machine to buy."
2,His Worst Book,"I read this when I was reading all the Hugo nominees that year and this was the most disappointing. I felt that this did not belong on the same platform with the other nominees. This book appears to be an obvious attempt to ""do Star Trek right"" with a non-military starship, alien races who are truly alien, and real adult characters. Unfortunately, as previous reviewers have written, Sawyer does not pull this off and we have a novel about a university director contemplating an affair co-mingled with the worst of the Star Trek movies.The entire novel seems inconsistent from scene to scene and is sometimes amazingly illogical which carries through to the ending. I cannot write too much about it without giving away some of the book but someone makes an awe-inspiring, illogical, bad, mundane, much more than life-time committment.He can be a good writer and people should enjoy his other works more."
2,"fun action, boring main character","This is a fun read for action and exploration as long as you don't think to deeply or have high expectations. The ""lofty message"" of the book is trite and the main character is caught up in the angst of his midlife crisis. While it might be interesting to some people to read about the inner turmoil of a middle-aged man in midlife crisis, I think it is boring. It is not really very interesting to read about some guy acting like a jerk to his wife and other people around him because he's caught up in himself and isn't sure he is going to achieve all his goals in life. A more appropriate format for all of the focus on this type of character might be self-help rather than science fiction. I read science fiction to relax and have fun. Real people in midlife crisis are boring and the main character in this book is boring."
1,...,"At first glance, it may seem like a hard SF reformulation of Star Trek. Then you realize the tachyon beams, warp speed, subspace disturbances, ... pseudo-science, and deus ex machina-based plots of Star Trek are actually better than this piece of junk.Sawyer attempts to create a grand space opera and in the process falls flat on his face. The science is miserable, in the league of such travesties as the aforementioned Star Trek: Voyager. It seems like Sawyer read a book on theoretical physics and completely misunderstood it. E.E. Smith's space operas seem like hard SF compared to this.Aside from the ludicrous science, the book is terrible. The characters are flat and one-dimensional, particularly the lead. The protagonist is constantly whining and more than a little annoying, and as a result the reader cares little for him. The plot is trite and predictable, and has been done dozens of times before.In short, avoid it like the plague."
2,Juvenile,"Given the Hugo nomination and others' reviews, I expected more from this book. Some time is spent developing the main character, but most of the other players are bland, colourless props. The science is interesting, but I frankly did not care what happened to anyone. Good character development and a well-developed plot need not be sacrificed on the altar of Science, as shown by such authors as Mary Doria Russel and Michael Swanwick."
2,Canadian disaster area,"Boring, juvenile, absurd...the list goes on and on. Reads like an el cheapo ripoff of Star Trek. Particularly moronic are the aliens."
5,Finally something more thorough,"Mr. Baker finally has created something what I am looking for! And that's someting very explicit about the F-14. He goes indepth with the history of the F-14 and how it was designed, tested and production. He even gives descriptions of the USN squadrons that have used the F-14. The books explains mostly about the Alpha model but the B model is also given. It lacks some information about the latest D model though.If you are F-14 buff this book is worth every penny in gold. Don't be intimidated by the 200pages."
4,Killer!,"Just like the inventor of this guillotine, this album is a killer. With hard tracks like Night Light and Dirty Girl, you can't go wrong. The rest of the album is also great. This isn't your typical techno, it comes on hard and doesn't let go. If you like DJ's like DJ T-1000 or Azteq, you'll almost certainly love this. The only popular DJ I can think of who might spin something similar to this is Marco V, but that's only to emphasize that hard nature of it."
4,Excellent Photographs--Numbers Not Bold Enough,"I liked all of the photgraphs, except one. The calendar is fine, but difficult to see the numbers of the dates from even mid-way across a room. I wish the dates had been printed a little more boldly."
1,Monster what? Ripoff?,I purchased this charger and batteries because of the 2100 mAh rating and because I need to charge my batteries very quickly. I found that the charge time is a little long and the batteries are very expensive. I saw Energizer Rechargable batteries at my local grocery store packaged with a charger for $25.95. The batteries were rated at 2500 mAh so I purchased the package. The first time I used the charger it had fully charged the batteries in 15 miuntes and the charge lasted longer than the Monster batteries which took twice as long to charge. I'd recommend going elsewhere for higher rated batteries at a cheaper price and that has a charger that gets them up and going twice as fast.
5,Digital Battery Charger,First Amazon thanks for the great service in delivering our item. It works fantastic. We are very satisfied with it.
2,CS4 tools needs improvement,"We bought two of this because it looks so great in the review and advertisement. After using it for a month, there are some flaws, which should be improved to make it a practical tool. Does anyone know what's the awl for? To us, it is too blunt to be useful. It should have sharper edge so we can actually open envelopes, remove staples, etc. The set of screw drives is comprehensive but take care not to exert too much force on them especially the small one, the tip WILL BEND. Anyway, it was be repaired with the other CS4 :-). If you are a Swiss knife user, you will find the Philips screw tip drive too big for common screws found in the office. Also, you should be real careful about the blade, cause it is really sharp... it hurts but we love it. If you are not too fussy about the strength of the tool, go get it."
2,Don't Drop It!,"This leatherman multi-tool is by far better looking than other leatherman tools, but as we all know: function over form. I've had the tool for about three months now. The blades get sticky and need to be cleaned more often than I'd like to. The handle is comfortable and the cork screw works great...but don't drop it: the finish is very fragile, it will bend and the color will scrape off. If you work on cars like me, you need to be constantly picking up and putting down your tool. If it falls out of your hand it will bend and the color will chip off. Another bad point about this leatherman is that the blades bend easily, and they can rust. Of course leatherman says that they are made of ""high quality stainless steel"" but if you put it under water or in the snow and forget to dry it off, you'll soon see that it will rust. If you can, avoid this one and go with the leatherman wave, but if you need a small tool to fit in the glove box of your toyota landcruiser, go with this one."
3,Good but rusts,"I had the CS4 for two months now. Overall a good tool. Everything works as advertised. The screwdrivers are a bit difficult to get out. In fact, I nicked myself while trying to open the screwdrivers. The biggest problem, however, is that the plier rusts. I used a damp towel to wipe away some residuals. A week later the plier teeth were pitted with rust spots.Also, it's a bit big to fit in pants pocket."
1,went dead and doesn't hold charge,thought I would give it a try to save moneyone didn't hold the chargethe other doesn't hold the charge for a reasonable time
3,Won't buy again,"These look nice and feel solid when using them, BUT, they do not hold trousers very well. I found a pair on the closet floor, wrinkled, because they slipped out of the hanger. If there were a more tactile surface, like a rubberized surface, they would be perfect. As of now, they are only a three star product."
3,"Okay, but?",These are okay but they are not very tight and I have already had slacks slip out of them. Okay for light wear.
4,"most of these songs are on Linda's ""Feels like home""","Although the album is wonderful, someone is lazy here! Can't they come up with new material? And if Linda's associated with one more ten song-only album, I'll stop buying. Christopher Bradley/nyc"
3,I already have most of this album,"I saw the trio on the Tonight Show this week, and went to Virgin Records intending to pick up Trio II. I looked at the play list and realized most of the tunes were ones I had heard. They were peviously released on other albums, especially Ms. Ronstadt's ""Feels Like Home."" Nothing annoys me more than companies that endlessly rehash the work of their artists. It would be a lot of fun if they'd tour together, but I'm not shelling out $14 for this one."
1,Unfortunate release for Talented Trio,"These artists are among my favorites, and I was so excited by the release that I did not perform due diligence and check out the track listings and customer reviews before purchase. What a rip-off. Many songs are straight off the ""Feels Like Home"" album. Most of the other material is flat and uninspired, with the production remarkably free of good grooves or strong rhythmic feel. These women sing like birds and blend like the wind in the trees, but please give us some of the real thing- Good (""new"") songs which are well produced and interpreted with soul and heart."
3,"Pleasant, but not as good as the first one.","What's so disappointing is that while there are 3 artists listed on the album, it sounds like they never were in the studio together, like they recorded their own songs and submitted them. These three ladies are so talented and sound so good together, it's a shame that they don't sing together more. Also, it would be nice if they would change lead vocals in the same song, like a true trio.As for the songs, mostly they are OK, but would somebody please tell what in the world 'After the Gold Rush' is about? Mother nature, space ships ... what???I wish this album was more country like the first one. It's too adult contemporary/pop. The first one was like visiting country's roots, a nice change from today's country.Also, the love of the music that came through on the first 'Trio' isn't here. Only 'Lovers Return' has that. The rest feels like a commercial venture."
2,Weak sequel,"Despite the beautiful voices, especially Linda's and Emmylou's, this album is a real disappointment. As good as the song selection was on ""Trio"", the same can't be said about this turkey. Mostly blah songs that are totally uninspiring. Spend your money on Emmylou's anthology or some of Ronstadt's other albums. Their version of ""After the Gold Rush"" does have its moments though."
3,A Disappointment,"Twelve years ago, Trio got me listening to old-timey, bluegrass and country music. Unfortunately, Trio II leans more toward easy listening schlock. Only Emmylou Harris's voice sounds as bright and powerful as ever on her solos. They should have let Alison Krauss sing instead of just playing fiddle (although she has begun to devolve toward easy listening, too). If you loved Trio, don't rush out to buy Trio II. I would recommend Claire Lynch's ""Silver and Gold"" for the qualities that made Trio so wonderful."
1,Disappointing follow-up,"Anyone who is a fan of TRIO, will be disappointed by this thing. Poor song choices and poor arrangements make it almost unlistenable, not to mention some inexcusable re-writing vis Neil Young's ""After the Gold Rush."""
4,Too many repeats from Feels Like home but worth having!!,If you like good vocals and true music this is a must to own! not much out there anymore with the quality of these voices.
1,Disappointing album ... we waited all these years for this?,"I bought this album anticipating the greatness that was TRIO. Unfortunately, TRIO 2 lacks everything that was in the first album. The voices and harmonies are still there briefly in some songs - but this is not sustained throughout all the songs. Hopefully, TRIO 3, if there will be one, would be a better product from these three talented artists."
4,Three Legends reunite...,"What can one say about these three women? An incredible album...""When we're gone, long gone"" is worth the buy alone."
3,"over-produced, but beautiful harmonies","I have played the first ""Trio"" CD to death. I was excited to hear about Trio II, but I wish they had let these extraordinary voices shine by themselves, the album sounds over-produced and in some places the audio equivalent of vaseline over the camera lens. Why? All of these women (still) sing beautifully. But the harmonies are wonderful, each voice a treasure, and that helps to overcome some of these problems."
5,A beautiful trio is what they should name it.,"I am a big country fan and love all three ladies, wonderful C.D"
4,Three Veterans Giving it to us,"As a young listener at the time this CD was released, I liked the CD alot as I came to know every song by heart. This is a pleasing effort from the trio with each lending their own unique qualities and abilities to the group. Linda is the loud belter; Dolly handles the bird-like, songbird songs and Emmylou takes the traditional country songs that require an authentic country voice. The material here is varied ranging from pure country to Adult contemporary, more in Linda's league. HIGH SIERRA shows the AC as Celine could get away with singing this song. There are some very touching songs that mean alot to me and they are toward the end. It is great to see these veteran performers come out and perform great material as such."
5,one you can listen to over and over again ...,"Parton, Harris and Ronstadt have put together a beautiful CD, one I find myself listening to on repeat for hours. I come at this album more from the folk angle than the country, and so I find it even more to my liking than the original Trio album. I highly recommend Trio II."
4,The Trio has returned!!!,"The first TRIO album was a winner, despite being released in the 1980's. The songs had a timeless appeal to them and Dolly, Emmylou and Linda obviously put their heart & souls into the singing. TRIO II is nearly as good. Some of the songs (especially After The Gold Rush) are a bit ""pop"" for a country trio, but that should help them snag a few fans from the ""other side of the fence."" Great job, ladies!"
5,angelic harmonies,"I really love this album, they sound great together and I am pleased that they are getting some commercial success! Not enough Linda for my liking but hey I would say that, I run a Linda web page @ http://users.powernet.co.uk/skeyes/dedicatedtolinda/index.html - Favourite songs? Lover's Return, You'll Never be The Sun and When We're Gone, Long Gone! can't wait for Emmylou and Linda's duet album due in July!"
2,This is a BIG disappointment,"It lacks the blending of voices that was so charming in Trio I. I'm still hoping that at least one song will ""grow on me."""
1,DOES NOT HOLD A CANDLE TO THE FIRST TRIO,"I HAVE LOVED ALL 3 FOR SO MANY YEARS..EMMYLOU, DOLLY AND LINDA... HAVE BOUGHT SO MUCH OF THEIR WORKS AND ENJOYED IT ALL.. WHEN I SAW THEM ON JAY LENO SHOW, I ORDERED FROM AMAZON THE NEXT MORNING.. I WAS SO EXCITED...THERE IS NOT ONE SONG THAT DOES IT FOR ME...AND I LOVED THE FIRST TRIO...HAVE IT MEMORIZED...THEY ALL LOOKED REALLY GOOD ON TV.. THAT MADE ME FEEL REAL HAPPY."
1,Ho-hum I,The original Trio was a wonderful mix of harmonies that showed off these women's styles that are so different yet blend so well.This one seemed a lot less inspired -- vapid actually -- by comparison.Big disappointment.
3,Rip-off,Don't buy this album if you already have Linda Ronstadt's Feels Like Home CD because 5 of the same songs appear on both records. That's half of the record! I felt gypped when I discovered that after I got it home and listened to it.
5,"I say it again, the greatest Country Music Trio ever heard!","Of course we're talking here about 3 of Country Music's superstars. However, not all star singers sing that well with others. These 3 however sing together as though they were born to do so!"
5,Makes my heart sing!,"This trio has a wonderful understanding of each other's strengths. Their harmonies are ""spine tingling."" I heard Scott Simon interview them this morning on NPR, while driving. When I arrived home, I immediately grabbed the mouse and drove to Amazon. Thanks for making this so easy."
2,Disappointment the 2nd--or is it the 3rd?--time around,"I read over the 19 reviews before sending this one in. For all of the people who think this album is great and wonderful, there is no disagreement, except for the fact that half of the album was released 4 years ago on Linda Ronstadt's ""Feels Like Home"" (1995). And when I say that they are the same 5 songs, I mean just that. The identical music tracks were used on ""Feels Like Home"", and honestly, when listening to these same 5 songs on ""Trio II"", I cannot tell the difference between them--except for the fact that you can hear Dolly's faint voice filling in additional harmony. And, the song ""Blue Train"" is exactly the same song as on Feels Like Home. Listen carefully, and you will notice that there is no Dolly at all on the song. Anyway, for those of you who didn't buy Linda's album in 1995, I guess you will enjoy Trio II. For the rest of us, it's like hearing ""Feels Like Home"" the second time around."
3,Mindless,"Don't quite know what to make of this one. Its OK for a laugh if you don't take it too seriously. Personally I didn't find the violence to be that realistic looking. I mean you've got to shoot someone in the head about 5 times before they go down. But these guys seem to have gone out of their way to insult every minority group there is, and I can't decide whether they're right-wing pro-gun or they're taking the p*ss out of right-wing pro-gun. The asian shopkeeper Lucky Ganesh seriously cracked me up though, although its obvious the makers of this game don't know the difference between Hindu's and Muslims. I'm British and we have asian shopkeepers exactly like him over here too. Very funny. Mostly though this game is pretty infantile."
3,Game was kinda bad,"For the 114 I paid for it 4 years ago, I'm pretty sure I was a dope and let myself get ripped off...oh well. Still have the disc somewhere, but didn't find it much fun when I played it."
1,Good game for pinheads!,I found absolutely no challenge inthis stupid game at all. Itis beneath me. What a waste of time and money. This game is Garb-aaaaaggggeeee!!!
5,Fun,"One of the most original and hilarious games I've played. The things you'll see, as well as do, is amazing. With a high end system this game even looks great. You won't be disappointed.Kudos to the guys and gals at 'Running With Scissors'.Highly recommended."
5,Very Pretty hair and Makeup,"I have Madison,Nolee and Chelsea and I want this doll and I will have em all.This doll has blue denim jeans w/ a pink and black top 4 her second outfit.Her hair and her eyeshaddow and lip gloss are so pretty together!She looks like an innocent little angel.Her first outfit is pretty much yhe same colorsI hope u found my review helpfultoodles"
3,Mmmmm,"Well. My scene is a nice group and I might like them if it wasn't for a few opinions.1. It seems they changed the body-type when Bratz came out2. It looks like they changed the shape of the lips, almost to resemble a smaller bratz lips, which I obviously thought was copyright infringment3. It seems that whenever you put the origional Cloe doll(bratz) next to the origional Barbie (myscene) doll, the lips are a total rip off of Cloe's, they have the same pinkish silver, with the pink outline.4. Than of course, there's the boys series, where they brought out the boys right when bratz brought out the boys. .I think it's either a nation conspiracy. .Or else Barbie is copying Bratz lips, shape, head style, and whenever they bring out a new series, it seems almost always, My scene brings out a thing like it..Well. . one proYou can own Barbie, and Cloe, and say Barbie is Cloe's mom, after all, they even wear the same make-up, nd have the same skin and hair color. . .Hope this helped.^.~"
5,Beautiful Barbie,"I got this Barbie to add to my collection from one of my friends. She is gorgeous and has beautiful clothes to go with it. The earrings that you can change are also very, very cool. I'd highly recommend this Barbie to anybody who has been a fan of the Barbie name for as long as I have, or for a parent of a stylish little girl :)"
4,"Removable belts and silver bracelets, oh my","The only thing keeping the Shopping Spree line from MyScene perfection? No stands. As it is, Barbie is pretty close on her own anyway.Barbie seems to have a thing for pink and black this year, especially when she's got pale pink lipstick. [The Dressed to Impress B is nearly identical in makeup] If that does nothing for you, the fact that her second outfit looks fantastic on just about any doll might. The introduction of actual belts that can be used on other outfits is also a welcome change as it gives you an easy way to change the whole look of whatever she's wearing. Overall, I'm pretty content with my newest doll."
5,"A bit pricey, but works well","Using a ziplock bag and inserting it under the laces would do the trick, but the pouch looks much nicer :) and it's easy to switch between shoes. It is also more secure than the plastic strap sold online. I have the Nike+ and the Adidas mi coach (both have space inside for the sensor) .. but using the pouch makes it easier to switch .. unless it's a rainy day then it might be safer to have the sensor hidden inside."
5,good,"is goob, but expensive...ok ok ok is good..... yes is good..... yes is good..... yes is good..... yes is good..... yes"
4,Very simple but very effective,Does the job very nicely. Simple to attach to shoe and remained secure throughout my runs. Data captured even in forested situations.
2,sensor case,"I was diappointed with this item. It is so much easier to use a shoe that is compatible with the sensor instead of using this pouch. Once you calibrate the sensor to the Nike shoe, you have to calibrate it again if you are going to use the sensor case instead. It's a bother having to calibrate it every time you are going to change shoes. I would stick with a Nike shoe. The Air Pegasus is an excellent shoe for long distances."
1,Doesn't Work As Advertised,"Product wouldn't attach such that the sensor could communicate with my Ipod. Took all the advice - fastened as low and as tightly as I possibly could - didn't work.Ended up taking a drill w/half-inch bit, peeled back the sole insert of my shoe & cut two 1/4 inch holes side-by-side. Cleaned it up with a pocket knife, inserted the sensor & put th sole insert back in. Took less than five minutes & works great.I love the Nike Plus product, but prefer my new Balance running shoes. I was hoping the folks @ Marware had figured out a solution but I don't think so."
3,It works.,It's a freakin strap with a small pocket of course it's gonna work. Shipping cost more than the actual product though. Don't buy if outside america.
2,Doesn't work so well.,"I received the marware pouch two days ago to use on my Asics. It holds the sensor well, but frankly, the setup doesn't work. My Nano catches only about half of steps. In fact, when calibrating for walking, it only captures .13-.14 of a .25 mile walk. My Nano gave me a calibration error because it was so far off. When I calibrated the run, it got .3 off a .25 mile. When I took it for my test run this morning, it only got .49 mile for over a mile run."
5,Just works...,"Because I refuse to wear Nike shoes due to their slim fitting shoes, I use Asics shoes for my running needs. After purchaseing the GPS watch from Nike, I found that I needed a way to attach the sensor to my shoe. The Marware case looks quite well and the sensor works with the watch as designed. I am looking to buy a few more when I get the Nike Fuelband as gifts for family and friends."
4,Works as advertised,"The Nike plus sensor fits snug into the sensor case. When using this case, I calibrated the sensor using the ipod touch and was surprised that the sensor was tracking very close without any calibration. This was a very cost effective solution to the problem of Nike requiring special shoes for their sensor. Good job Marware!"
5,Great Product,Purchases a new pair of running shoes which were not Nike+ compatible but I wanted a way to keep track of my daily runs and I found this product. Works great! Simply followed the directions and my typical route measured the exact same distance but I went for a run on the outdoor track to recalibrate just in case. Haven't had any problems and I prefer the way this product is made out of a durable fabric which encases the sensor. This seems more durable than a clear plastic clip some of the other vendors are selling. I would recommend this to any runner who wants to watch their progress with Nike+ and have the benefits of a good pair of running shoes that aren't Nike+ compatible.
5,Def. Get,This works perfectly! I tested it out to make sure it clocked the correct mileage on a path I knew the exact distance for and it was right on. the people who said this didn't work well must not have used it correctly.
2,Less accurate than the competition,"Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I have not yet been able to consistently get decent accuracy readings using this pouch for the nike sensor. Perhaps it's more the general limitations of the nike plus system. Though in comparison the switcheasy runaway with the hard plastic container gave a lot better readings overall. The price was alright, but not sure if I would buy again."
4,needs good placement,The sensor works better if you place this pouch UNDER the BOTTOM laces; had trouble with the sensor picking up because it was 'flopping' when attaached as the directions show.
1,Not good for Nike+ Sensor,Your better off putting the sensor in your sock on the inside of your heel (which is not as secure and more uncomfortable). I ran about 2 miles of intervals using this on my track shoes. It only recorded about 0.25 miles. Had to delete that entire workout because it lowered all my averages. I don't recommend this for the sensor.
4,Sensor Case,"I bought this item thinking it was a wristband to carry the sensor in. I re-read the product information several times, and unfortunately it isn't what I thought it was. I am keeping it and will use it on my shoe. I was hoping to find a way to carry the sensor that didn't involve my shoes as not all have laces."
5,Excellent!!,"I ordered this for a friend and shipped to her address. I didn't tell her that I bought it for her, because I wasn't sure if she'd be glad to get it. The product shipped quickly and she told me it arrived before I realized it was processed. She was very happy to get it and I was glad the transit time was so quick."
5,Worth the extra cost,"I bought this for my wife based on other reviews. I was hesitant to spend the extra money, but it was worth it. High quality, the sensor doesn't move. Haven't used in rain yet, but it doesn't rain much in Central TX. If you want to get if a bit cheaper you may have to sacrifice and get an ugly color. I like this enough I am looking to Marware to buy a new holder for my iPod."
4,Nike+ Sensor Case,"Wonderful item!! I have a pair of Adidas shoes, and I use the sensor case, and it is RIGHT ON! I calibrated my run on the track and it is perfectly calibrated to the step! I frequently recheck to make sure that it is still accurate, and it never disappoints me! You do have to follow the directions and insert the sensor into the case EXACTLY as it tells you to, otherwise, it will NOT be accurate."
5,perfect for the purpose,"I love this product. It is small, well made and even kinda cute. I wish it was available in other colors besides black, but for its purpose it definately gets the job done. I love it."
4,Awesome product,"This product was amazing, no problems what so ever.A few things to note though, you will need to recalibrate the Nike+. Also, make sure you insert the sensor the correct way otherwise you will have problems! Also make sure to have the package tightly secured to your lace.I have not had a single problem with this products accuracy as stated in other reviews, I've used it on tracks to track the accuracy and so far had close to perfect accuracy."
5,thank you for not making me buy nike + shoes,nike plush shoes are way overpriced and all because they take that little tab sensor. This eliminated the need for the shoes and now we can use it on our normal shoes everyday if we like.
3,Simple product that gets the job done,If you don't want to shell out for a Nike+ shoe buy this to still use Nike+ technology. I have a unique foot size (narrow) so Nike+ shoes were out for me. If you've got a shoe you like that isn't Nike+ then this little gadget will help you use the Nike+ sensor without giving up your great shoes. It's velcro and will fit around any lace shoe you own.Buy this product (or any other brand of the same thing).
5,The perfect addition to your Nike+ sensor,"Must have, great product and quality has lasted through rain, snow, sweat, and Hot Texas weather. Don't buy the expensive special Nike+ shoes. All you need is this and the Nike+ sensor and you good to go!"
4,Not bad.,works well if you don't wear Nike running shoes that have it built in. I think it is a little bulky but works.
4,Good value - Marware Sensor case for Nike+ iPOD Sport kit,"Pretty good value and works well; but before you invest, consider if you are going to get a Nike+ iPod...the Nike+ iPod isn't really worth the money if you want accurate running times."
3,It's a good if you don't have the Nike shoes,This little product is good if you don't want to spend $100 + on the Nike air shoes that have the pod to hold the sensor in. It's kind of a tight fit and makes taking the sensor in and out a little hard. I would recommend to anyone who doesn't want to buy the sneakers...
1,Doesn't work,This item does not work. The material must be too thick. Use it without this and the sensor will work by just sticking it in your laces. Making a lightweight pouch myself. This is a ripoff.
1,iPod Sport Sensor kit,Fine product. Works well when tied to your shoe. I am happy that I could continue running in my shoes and still use my Ipod for tracking the runs.
5,It Works!,"I was concerned how well this would work after reading several reviews. But, I have been pleasantly surprised and very pleased with the results. It is totally unnoticeable on my shoe while running and the distance measurements have been accurate to within 50 yards on 3 mile runs. That's close enough for me. Many of the problems mentioned in other reviews have not been issues for me. Nike shoes have never fit me well and this was a great investment and alternative."
5,GREAT!!!,"I only have RAVE reviews for this product! I tried buying the very expensive Nike+ shoes, but they hurt my feet terribly. At the enormous price, I was actually glad to return the shoes. After finding this little pouch for under $5, I couldn't believe I could be so lucky! It worked perfectly. I have had it for almost a year now and have had no problems at all. I highly recommend this product."
4,No problems with accuracy,"The product is like described. I purchased the new Nike Waffles for running 2 to 3 mile distances. Since the Waffles are not Nike + compatible this has been a great purchase. From what I can tell, the milage and accuracy seem correct. Like mentioned in other reviews, be sure to keep tight and towards the bottom of laces above toe area."
4,Great product.,"The holder is a little bigger than I thought it would be, but it works really well. Just make sure you put the sensor in correctly remembering that you put it in upside down and flip the holder over. Just as accurate as my sister's Nike+ band and sensor so don't believe Nike when they say it has to be in a Nike+ capable shoe :) Happy running!"
5,Great product for non-Nike+ shoes,This cool little product will allow you to experience the full benefits of Nike+ without having Nike+ shoes.I have used this strap for over a month now without any problems. The construction of the strap is good and it is easy to use.I highly recommend this product.
1,Poor Accuracy,"Product attaches easily to different styles of shoes but the accuracy was poor. I usually run a three mile route daily, but using the attachment it declared I ran 0.89 mile for the same route. The accuracy was terrible, not even half! It doesn't register your steps like when the chip is in your shoe. If you want to track the distance of your run, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. Instead, bite the bullet and buy nike plus shoes. It truly is worth the extra money."
2,"Sleek and sexy, but my accuracy rate went down...","This iPod sensor holder looks so much better on my shoes than the huge Shoe Wallet I was using before. The only problem is that when I used it, my accuracy rate fell into an unacceptable range. I did a three mile run and it only registered 1.5 miles. I tried recalibrating, but the iPod couldn't read the sensor enough to register that I had gone ANY distance, much less 400 meters.The second I put the sensor back into the Shoe Wallet, my accuracy rate was right back to normal. The Sport Sensor is gathering dust in a drawer now..."
4,"Cheap, Easy, and Works Well",This is the best device I have found to house my Nike Plus sensor. Never has fallen out. I bought this after I lost my sensor when it fell off my shoe because I had a more expensive case that I had bought in a running store. Only thing with this product you have to be careful with is making sure the sensor is facing the right direction.
4,Good stuff,"Yeah, I got this because I wanted to use the Nike + Kit with my New Balances. And like a lot of other idiots I initially put the sensor upside down. But I got straightened out and everything is cool."
3,It kind of works...,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep lifting up the insole of the shoe to insert/remove the Nike sensor so I got this case. I guess that your laces have to be on the tighter side to make sure that the sensor picks up your movement because I only got .78 miles acknowledged on my 2+ mile jog/walk; I don't have loose laces--I just don't tie them tight. I was pissed because the ONLY reason why I even go out to jog/walk is because I get to record my sessions on the Nike+ website (I find absolutely NO joy in jogging/walking). Instead of ""risking"" another mis-measurement, I just put the sensor in the shoe (I take the sensor out because I use these shoes for every day use too and the instructions said to take out the sensor to save battery life); I have had no problems with the sensor when it's in the shoe. I have a friend who described the same kind of situation with the case and even went further to say that it can vary from shoe-to-shoe!"
5,shoe sensor,"This Sport Sensor Nike iPod Sport Kit shoe device works really well.My husband and I and our friend all use them, and we are almost always within0.2 miles of each other when we run together. We think that's close enough.We never have any problems with the sensor finding our ipod. Our friend uses theNike watch with her iPod, but we use the traditional sensor/iPod nano combo.These sensors make it really nice to switch the system between pairs of sneakers."
5,works great,inexpensive and gets the job done - also I don't have to buy Nike shoes to use their sensor
3,"Small, easy to use, and effective.","While it is true that a pair of Nike+ shoes will hold the Nike Sport sensor better, (and keep it hidden,) this lil' pocket is small and easily overlooked. It hold the sensor tightly, which makes for a more accurate calibration, and I highly recommend it if you cannot or do not wish to use Nike+ shoes."
3,"Decent product, ridiculous shipping","It's not a complicated gadget, so it would have been hard to scew it up. It works as anticipated, but the shipping cost more than the item. When I received it, the packaging and postage clearly did NOT warrant the price for shipping. Yes, I know ""shipping charges"" includes handling, and someone gets paid to put the item in the package, adhere the sticker, and seal the envelope. It's still ridiculous-- unless the guy who packaged it makes about $60 an hour."
5,"Ideal, minimalist design works perfectly","This product is about as simple as it could possibly be, and still be secure and flexible at attaching to a wide variety of shoes. It has worked perfectly for me, and about all I would change is to make the sewn-on logo go away (I don't really care for branding). But the Marware logo is relatively generic, so not a big deal, and if I really care, it's easy to cut the threads and take it off myself."
4,Basic Common Sense,"I found this book to be an excellent, no nonsense approach to organizing and planning for financial security. I have since read Smart Women Finish Rich, and have given many copies of both books as gifts to members of my management team, friends and young family members starting out on their own. It is well written in terms that are easy to comprehend and apply as well as some valuable resources to utilize in order to build a solid plan for future financial independance. My only objection is to the reference to the 'latte factor'. I am sure that other more glaring sacrafices can be made an example of for financial security just please not the coffee!:)Amy CarlsonRetail Operations - NJStarbucks Coffee Company"
4,"Simple, but important information.","While this book is simple, I do believe that there are alot of people out there who will ""get it"" on how important it is to save while they're young. The ones who already ""get it"" are more than likely already older or had someone to advise them like a parent or employer. This is a good book for those interested in saving for their future but not quite sure how to go about it. It has some really good information. Even though I already knew most of it, it reinforced my thinking and made me re-evaluate how much I was putting back in my 401k. I would recommend this book to someone young (say 35 or younger) or someone who has no retirement savings. It would give you a really good start."
4,Good Read for Anyone Who Needs a Reminder,"Okay, so maybe you KNOW what you should be doing to repair or improve your finances. But then you think: it's too simple; how can putting aside money for myself first possibly get me on a better financial path?This book reminds you that sometimes a single, common-sense step is what it takes to help you continue (or start) your journey to financial security.That reminder alone is worth the price of admission for David Bach's latest book. Granted, there is NOT a lot new here. But the longest journey begins with a single step, and all that.So if you need a reminder about what you should be doing financially, you'll find it here.Reviewer: Linda Painchaud"
5,YES---A very good book!,"Dave Bach has put together all of the strategies in this great new book to help you reach financial success. Following Dave's advice will save me at least $50,000 on my mortgage and get my credit card and all debt paid off in five years or less.Thank you DAVE!"
5,I highly recommend this book to anyone,I've gone back and bought extra copies to give to everyone. I read this four years ago and I have been watching my savings steadily increase. Great book for a college grad.
1,Save your money!!,"Consider this book a Double Flat Latte!!!If you have already read Smart Couples or Women, this book will be a complete waste of your time and money. If you haven't read Smart Couples or Women, then I highly recommend you purchase one of those. The information in Automatic Millionaire presents the same information that was in those books.I like and have followed David's steps in his Smart Couples book and have been very successfull in achieving my goals.I think David should ""write"" a new book on the next steps of financial planning instead of ""cut and pasting"" an old book."
2,"Come on people, 5 stars?",I can sum up this book for you: Do everything your mother told you was prudent. If she didn't tell you anything then do what you are constantly told in every financial guide - save money consistently and don't waste it on nonsense. If you bought this book you just broke rule #2.The second edition of the book will add this wealth-accumulation method: Compile a bunch of common-sense and readily available facts about any subject and create a book. Get a tempting cover and a slick marketing campaign to sell said book.
2,Baby book,"The Automatic Millionaire is great for inspiration only. If you need that little extra ""rah rah"" for saving then this book is great for reading on the toilet or while waiting for the dentist. Bach breaks it down and reminds us that while his concepts are simple and easy many people just don't follow them. I agree. He roots for us and urges not to be spendy which is great but I do have a problem with the book. It is over-simplified. If you want a REAL book on how to manage your money that is JUST as simple to read check out Mary Hunt's Debt-Proof-Living."
3,Common sense in paperback form,"It's a well-written, accessible book. Bach is an engaging writer. That's not my beef.My beef is that this book is good common sense. . In fact, I bet you're doing most of what Bach suggests right now by having your 401(k) or IRA contributions automatically deducted from your paycheck or bank account and using online bill pay.There's no revolutionary or insightful information in this book that you can't get from his column on Yahoo! Finance, or from almost any financial web site. Save your cash."
1,Yet another rah rah book,"Just another one of those books that lead (or mislead) you to think you can make it, only to find that it is harder, or impossible to get rich. Sure, follow the advice and you won't be bankrupt, but that kind of results we can get from listening to our folks in their eighties! Try simpler and down-to-earth books like The Art of Happiness at Work or Dot Zen."
2,blah,If your a young person starting out this might apply to you but if your 40+ forget it you already know the answer!
1,Give me a break,"Oh please, give me a break. Anyone who gave Mr. Bach a 5 star rating must have been a friend of his. This book is so basic. You could find this advice on most financial websites for free.Invest your money instead into your savings account."
1,opportunist,"I will never read anything by this author again, He should not be allowed to publish books. He was subsidized by Wells Fargo because his book pushed home ownership and second home ownership, without regard for being able to afford the home/homes. He is not the cause of the housing bubble but a flag bearer for it. And rather an opportunist and a profiteer."
4,This Really Works,The best book on getting rich that I've read. The process is extremely simple. The only part that I would change is that I would place tithing first.
1,More proof that how to get rich is to write a book,"David Bach gets rich by telling the rest of us things we should already know: ""PAY YOURSELF FIRST!"" ""Don't eat out so much/get rid of extras."" Does anybody out there really think this is new information??? He then goes on to give advice on how to manage retirement accounts, 401Ks, etc in order to maximize profit. Newflash, Mr. Bach: the people who really need help certainly don't afford to have IRAs and 401Ks, and if we do eat out, it's off the Value Menu at Wendy's....once a week if we're lucky. All this book does is prove that if you want to get rich in the 21st century, rephrase ""Well-Duh"" common sense so it sounds like something new, get it published, and talk other people into buying it. Sigh. Skip this one, folks. Your mamma can give you the same advice for free."
1,For This He Had To Write A Book,"The author has managed to pack all the wisdom of a 6-inch newspaper column into this book. Payroll deduct your savings, avoid debt, pay down your mortgage quickly. That's about it. The rest is fluff. Save your money and your time."
5,"Great advice, Gave a copy to all my children.","I have practiced many of the principles covered in this book for much of my life and found them to be very helpful to my own financial management. The author presents them in an entertaining, yet convincing, way. I enjoyed reading the book and immediately ordered copies for all of my 7 children. Several of them have commented on how much the book has helped them to make the commitment to sound financial principles in their own lives."
4,Choose To Become Rich Automatically,"There are no new ideas in this book nor are there any secrets to becoming rich. Basically, the whole book discuss having part of paycheck, pre-tax if you can do it, deducted automatically and let compound interest and time work its magic to make someone rich. Needless to say, the younger you are when you start this, the better off you'll be. Most of the calculations in the book presume that the investor will be able to obtain 10% annual returns over the course of their lives, which is always hard to predict given our volatile future and the state of the markets. What this book does do well, however, is motivate the younger generation to start saving money for themselves and their future. We live in a culture defined by making more to spend more. This, we all recognize, is not wise, yet few people actually diligently follow the advice in the book. It's a short and quick read, but had it gone on too much longer it would have become too repetitive."
5,BEST financial book ever,I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone...preferably to a teen so they start off on the right foot but anyone at any age would benefit. It teaches you just how easy anyone with any salary can save money and retire early. I borrowed this book from a friend and loved it so much that I bought one for me to have and bought a second one to give as a gift for Christmas.
2,a book for beginners,"The book offers some practical advice but nothing beyond what can be found on the internet, TV or a friend. While it was a good reminder to start saving for retirement, the book has some flaws such as stating that saving requires no budgeting or discipline. He calls putting away 20% of your income and giving up your daily dose of caffine a ""no-budget, no-discipline"" plan."
3,Anything is better than nothing -,"With the alarming level of financial ignorance in this country, anything that adds to the public's financial IQ is worthwhile. I know of what I speak. I work as a retirment counselor for individuals and institutions in my profession. That said, this is an extremely simplistic book that is a reiteration of Mr. Bach's earlier works. That is not to say there is not any merit to what Mr. Bach says. However, my feeling is you would be much better served by other books, such as Personal Finance for Dummies, which also explain basic financial concepts in laymans terms but are much more broad based, and therfore much more valuable, than the approach taken by this book."
3,Incomplete advice?,"I found this book simplistic and incomplete. Our income is close to that of Jim and Sue. We live modestly in a $100,000 house that has around 30,000 left on the mortgage which we have paid ahead 5 years. We save 14% of my income for retirement, have 3 months income saved as a cushion, tithe 8%, and have less than 1% credit card debt. We drive a 10 yr old car and a 7 yr old minivan. No cable TV, no vacations, no extraodinary expenses - in fact our monthly expenses are less than other financial books give as guidelines. Bach doesn't tell us how Jim and Sue paid for a 450,000 house on their income? There is nothing in the book about major purchases - like a car, college education, medical bills, etc. And perhaps Bach underestimates property taxes, utilities, and the cost of raising children. I frankly am puzzled ... The advice Bach gives is GOOD but he doesn't go far enough in my estimation."
3,"Average reading, common sense and automatic.",The methods described in this book are actually things that do make sense and are eye openers. Very simple stuff to follow. Not complicated at all. Just put your finances on automatic.
1,Nothing new or original in this book,"First, I'm shocked Mr. Bach could convince a publisher to take on what really should have been an article, not a full book. Secondly, Mr. Bach doesn't express a single new idea or concept. In fact, he actually steals ideas from other popular authors. Forget spending your money on this book. Just follow the money guidance contained in the books already on your bookshelf."
3,Financial advice for those with IQs below 80,"But I guess they DO need advice, too. For example: ""gross income (that's pretax income or income before taxes)..."" Thanks, David. I thought that meant it was just icky.The advice in this book is sound -- very basic -- but nonetheless sound. Sock away 10% in a 401(k), pay yourself first (how many times have you heard that?), etc. The McIntyres do sound a little contrived (what, did he tape the whole conversation??).Read his first two columns on Yahoo! Finance and you'll have basically read about 90% of the book.However, its redeeming value is that it is motivational to save a little more and be more frugal -- and if it does that and nothing else, it's worth reading. His chart that shows you can end with the same amount if you contribute $3000 a year from age 15-19 and stop or contribute $3000 a year from age 27 to 65 is very eye-opening.For a more intelligently oriented book, read ""Millionaire Next Door""."
3,"A great starting point, not the end-all-be-all","I gave this book 3 stars because I was disappointed. This is a good beginners book, and definitely highlights many financial pitfalls that most people fall into. It also gives some great advise to young people and couples just starting out in their financial lives. However, the book gives an extremely high level overview and doesn't give much detail on any subject. I was looking for a more detailed book with more guidance. Does this makes for a quick and easy read? Yes, which is what I believe the author intended. However, if I were a novice at financial studies, I would feel like ""okay...what do I do now?"" Great start, needs more direction."
3,"Nothing earth shattering, but useful","A lot of people are screaming that there is nothing really new in here. Sometimes you just have to be reminded of the basics. This is not a 7 figures in 7 days type of book. If you looking for instant wealth, look elsewhere. If you want to retire and not be stuck eating government cheese, then read it, follow it and just do it.It reminded me of a couple things that I already knew, but just needed somebody to tell me again."
4,A simple brilliant program for financial security!,"I was one of the original 100 people in the Automatic Millionaire seminar. The system or approach is sensible and easy. By following the steps in this book, you can have a worryfree retirement. But it does take work. It takes getting the ""latte factor"" under control and some self-discipline to ""Pay Yourself First"". And you have to make decisions about investments. And you has to be honest with yourself. But by keeping things simple and letting time do its work, you will prevail. Just buy this book, take the steps outlined in it and relax."
3,Nothing groundbreaking,"I applaud David Bach for creating a step-by-step guide on the basics of saving but I must say that I found nothing particularly unique and original about his approach. His 10% method is well-explained but we've all seen 15% and 20% methods too that would work just as well if followed perfectly. I think this book serves as a reminder that our saving habits in this country need to be reviewed, the US has one of the lowest saving rates in the Western world and our credit craze has serious implications on our long-term wealth. David's book just affirms what good common sense already tells us."
5,Powerful book...definitely a must read,"I can't recommend this book highly enough. Like the review, I do not understand the 1 star reviews...must be the same person reposting over and over.The Automatic Millionaire is a great book. No fluff, just real meaty finanial advice that really works.Ignore those paid 1 star bashers and readt this book. You'll be glad you did."
1,There are better books even for beginners,"This book has almost no substance. Anybody can give an advice, start investing in 401K, IRA etc but what abt the real questions like what mutual funds, what cap, fees, tax are not addressed at all. I think Suze Orman's books are much better for beginners."
2,Pretty basic advice,"I was disappointed by the lack of depth of advice. Basically, he recommends contributing to your 401k; buying a house and paying your mortgage down by making bi-weekly payments, automatically deducted from your account; and paying down your debt by have payments automatically deducted from your account. If you have any fiscal sense at all, you are already doing most things recommended in this book. If you are a novice at finances, you might find it slightly helpful."
2,Took No Expert To Write This,"I HAD to read this book. The hype was overwhelming. Best-seller lists, waiting lists at the library. Wow! I was so excited to find out how to be an Automatic Millionaire. Turns out, I already knew how and I was already doing enough to be on my way.Quick summary: open and contribite to an IRA, save money by not wasting it on unneccessary things, pay off your mortgage, repeat.I could have come up with that in about 15 minutes. There is new information in this book. The actual way to become an automatic millionaire should be as follows:Write a book that includes information that everyone already knows, put a nice cover on it, sell it for $20 each.I would pass on this book."
3,Basic Financial information,"This is a very basic book to start getting your financial plan together. The idea of setting up automatic accounts isn't new.It has some good ideas like, pay off your home and don't carry credit card debt. Don't buy anything until you have saved enough for it is a little unrealistic.In an ideal world everyone would have followed the plan."
2,Boring,"This book provides nothing new. It is centered on the whole idea of setting up your retirement accounts so they automatically deduct from your paycheck. If you have 401k, duh, it does that automatically...anyway, boring. It also says to save money, don't use credit cards, pay yourself, blah, blah, blah. Oh yeh, if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years...zzzz. Ok, it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks. One idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account. Upon reading this, I decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal .2% I've been earning on my saving account. And not realizing the latest craze started by ING, all the other banks offer an ""online savings"" account which offers 5% compare to the dismal .2%. I immediately switched! Other than this part of the book, it was boring."
5,Great Wealth System!,"I loved this book so much that I bought his CD System!I really like the idea of a ""forced savings system"" since I'm a mortgage banker. I learned a lot from my bankruptcy, and I was searching for a working system. I loved his case examples, and his directness. His book is simple to follow and is chock full of important references. I went on to buy his next book, Start Late, Finish Rich as a result of reading this book. He's got a solid system for ""saving"" money! You'll learn to take your coffee money and invest it for the future wisely. This book is a must have in your financial book collection. His credentials are impeccable. His writing is simple to understand and has vivid examples that teach wonderful concepts that will bring you to financial independence in the future! I loved this book!"
2,"long winded, myopic and basic","I am not in any way a financial expert, but I found that I could have written the same book myself with ad hoc advice I've picked up passively throughout the years. The most frustrating thing about spending the money on this is, I don't live in the USA and nearly all the advice is for Americans... executing what he advises is not possible where I live."
1,Total Rip-Off,"How on earth could I have been so foolish to fall for this title? Nothing in life is automatic, particuarly becoming wealthy. This book is FILLED with misrepresentation, misleading statements and down right hype. I guess the way to becoming an automatic millionaire is to find a slick way to ripoff people at the checkstand. Well phooey on you, Mr. Bach. My Barnes and Noble will let me return this book if I am not satisfied. And guess what? I'm not satisfied. This publisher should be sued for daring to publish such a dishonest tome."
1,The Automatic Millionaire,As a entrepreneur this book did not impress me in the least. If you are a person stuck in the industial age and want to stay there this book is for you. One of my bankers recomended that I read this book witch showed me the sad realities of people's industrial age mind set's that are still inbeded in to many of us in today's world of globalization and information. See no healthy reasoning in this book in relating to modern ecconomic realities. This type of thinking holds no real future for us. Recomend reading Donald Trump's and Rich Dad's series book's instead.
5,Great starting point....,"No need to go into detail about what this book is all about. I do recommend it, it is a great starting point and a very good motivator with a pleasant reading style. It will give you examples and list numerous websites and phone numbers to get started with investing for your future. I did find that what could have been said in 2 pages it takes the author 10 pages to say it, he keeps repeating things while preparing you to give you the answer. Waste of pages, but I guess that is how you make a book out of a simple (successful) concept. You have to fill the pages somehow!Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this book, since I find its ideas are crucial to building personal wealth."
5,Automatic Millionaire,David Bach's Automatic Millionaire is an excellent easy to read step by step formula for wealth. David eliminates the mystery of wealth by defining its formula in simple and clear to understand terms. He proactively enables and propels his readers towards a different mind set in regards to personal finances while inspiring the reader through the use of examples and charts. He explains how to set up an automated system to pay oneself first before paying anyone else. David shows and explains how to save thousands by paying off a mortgage early and the best way to pay off credit card debt. This is a must have book for 2004!
5,A Must Read For Parents,"12-31-2011 David Bach fills an enormous void with this book. A parent will not be far into it at all when he or she (h/s) already knows how to provide for his or her (h/h) own, and h/h childrens' futures in a way that is easily within h/h means. The subject, both important and urgent, should be a primary part of our educational system, but like so much else that is vital for Americans to know, it is omitted in favor of stuff that should not be part of the educational system. I would like to see all schools add this book to the curriculum and to the school library, and I thank Amazon for carrying it, making it available so reasonably, and shipping it so quickly. Happy New Year to all! - frequentreader"
4,Good book,"This is a very good book. It is filled of good practical investment advice regarding hot to fund your own retirement. If you purchase this book, you will not be disappointed."
2,just one idea doesn't make a good book,- Automatically pay towards your 401k- Automatically pay off your debt- Automatically pay your mortgage (faster)That's about it. Save yourself the read.
1,duh,Automatically put your money into savings and retirement. That's all he's saying. Duh. Don't waste your money.
3,"Good intro, not just about automating","I expected this book to be completely about using electronic means to automate payments, investments, and bills. It turns out that it gives a good introduction to the different topics that it addresses (mainly retirement focused, but some for home ownership). I also like that he gives suggestions on websites to look at for more information regarding different things like money market accounts and ways to help get home owner loans. I would read this again if I wanted a good overview of the topics and recommend it to someone else who wants that as well."
5,Very good financial book. Thank you Dave,My wife and I were watching Dave last nite on the Oprah Winfrey show so I went out straightaway today and bought it along with Donald Trumps book Trump: How To Get Rich.Dave Bach offers some very powerful strategies on how to keep and create wealth. We already made several changes that will save us thousands immediately.
1,Seems all to familiar......,"If you have read another book by David Bach, save your money. This book has no new ideas.I was very disappointed in the book. Mr Bach has repackaged material from previous books in a more simplified manner. I was hoping for more insight since I had read two of his earlier books, but found the material all to familiar. It seemed like a dumbed down version of smart women finish rich.I can sum up his message (and save you $13+) - save 10% in retirement, buy a house, don't use credit cards, and tithe and do all of these in the most simple way possible and then you will be a millionaire."
2,Very similar to authors other books,"I gave this book a low rating for one reason, the book is so similar to the authors other books that there really isn't a reason to buy it if you have read the other books. Many of the examples and stories in the book are taken from the authors earlier books. If you have read his other books, save your money and invest it.If you have not read any of the authors books then this is a pretty good book with practical advice on how to automatically save for your future. Many people talk about saving but never do until it is too late. I have used the same method of investing and it does work over a long period of time.So my adivce is to buy the book if you have never read any of his other books. If you have any of the other books I think you will be disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I have read many books of this type. I was very disappointed in this book. It merely reiterates the time old adages of: pay your self first; pay off your credit cards; pay down your mortgage; and buy one coffee a day, instead of two.In my opinion, it is only a watered-down version of ""The Wealthy Barber"". The ideas in ""The Automatic Millionaire"" are solid advice, but have been written many times in many other books. Unfortunately I found no new ideas in the book, nor were there many helpful suggestions that could have been mentioned.This book might be helpful to someone just entering the workforce who has very little financial knowledge.Andrew"
1,YOU can make David Bach a millionaire...,"Yes, buy this book and you can make David Bach rich! Unfortunately, it will do little for you.David, tell us something we don't know!""Pay yourself first.""(wow, that is revolutionary!)""Reduce your debt.""(not too easy if you are livning paycheck to paycheck)""Contribute to your 401K""(If you aren't already, you're in trouble...)Here we have a restatement of the obvious, for those people who have not paid attention for a decade. Amazing.Don't waste your money. (I did it so you don't have to...)"
4,Worth the read,"This book is definitely worth reading. I would probably give it 5 stars but he bashes using a budget and says how they don't work then he shows you how to set up an automatic system to make your money behave - isn't that what a budget is? I guess he is splitting hairs on the budget issue, I personally believe a budget is critical for financial success. Mr. Bach just presents a more automated way to live on a budget and end up with the wealth we all long for. Definitely worth reading and gleaning the useful information that will work for you. Just remember you actually have to use the information he gives if you want it to work. Happy reading."
4,Good Advice,"He shares very good advice, but I had already started many of the suggestions in the book before I even read the book. Take much of what is said and do apply it in your financial portfolio, hopefully you will gain knowledge. I may not be a millionaire but my money is working for me just fine."
1,HATED it.,"This book was absolutely terrible. It provided some good insight on money management however I could not get passed how sales-oriented this book was. I couldn't get through one chapter without him trying to sale me some additional project he has or lead me to his website. I found this distracting and it felt like he was trying to take advantage of readers by weaving this information throughout the book. Also, the information generally caters to people with steady jobs and does not account for people who make lower wages. I imagine that anyone earning minimum wage would find the guidelines of this book extremely hard to follow."
5,in a word - simple!!!!,"david bach's words of advice are so simple to implement that you'll wonder why you haven't done these steps years ago, most are painless and easily accomplished within a few minutes and a few clicks of the mouse, and the fruits of this minimal labor on your part will be tenfold, not just financially, but emotionally -- you will feel more in control, more 'on top' of your financial life, and free to enjoy all the other aspects of your life without any clouds hanging over you, it's a very easy quick read, with the steps completely spelled out for you to change your life within just a few weeks, tell all your friends!!!!"
2,Lame!!,"Nothing in life is free! Didn't your mom ever tell you about ""the free lunch"".Check out ""There for the Taking"" by James Whiddon and Lance Alston for REAL advice!"
2,"Get a 401K, Build and Emergency Fund, Buy a House, Die","The book was an interesting read. However, there are a of generalizations inside. You must own a house to be rich.....nope. Even if you own your house, what type of cash flow does it bring to you??? What does Net Worth really do for anyone unless it pays? A lot of my family members own their own house, but nobody pays them to live in it. They just pay the taxes and repairs. What if you move every three years for your job? It might not be the correct answer. Although, for some people it is the right answer. Rule #1 - Money doesn't flow towards generalizations. It flows towards respect.The tone of the book favors the 401K over the ROTH IRA. Read anything by Suze Orman. She gives the best advice on retirement planning and strategies.The overall theme of the book is good. Automatic investing works for me."
2,"Could of been a 2 page artical, not a 200 page book..","This book took me about 2 hours to read. It was light on substance.. The couple he uses as an example of ""Automatic Millionaires"" seemed made up, I do not know if they are supposed to be real, never the less - they seemed fake. While the book gave some good advice -- it was VERY basic and didn't say anything earth shattering.. The theme of the book was...SAVE your money (401k).. INVEST your money, BUY a HOUSE.. and DO NOT WASTE your money on Coffee ... Stay out of Debt and use ""automatic payments"" to do everything!...While the book gives good advice, it does not go into detail on much...to me it was just basic advice the most people should knowIt was a let down for me."
5,I love this book! It's easy to make it automatic!,Easy to follow methods about how to manage and save your money. The information in this book is still relevant in 2012!
1,Total waste of Money,Do not waste your money here. Very disappointed with this Book. Mostly information on 401k's that you can get anywhere on the Internet. A couple of Catch Phrases and recycled info found for free just about anywhere. Wanna get Rich ? Write a book like this and find suckers to buy it.
5,True story,"Yes this really is a true story. I know because my Father : Robert V. Phillips CQM (COB) was on this patrol. It really did happen. Except for the personal drama between officers. The real Commander Was Commander McGregor. He was one of the top Sumbarine Commanders in the Navy. The ship that was sunk was the Unryn. She was a brand new Japanese aircraft carrier on her way to Midway, fully loaded. The U.S. Submarine Redfish. The only Submarine to sink a aircraft carrier by herself through WW2. The Redfish received a Presidential citation for her bravery. And Commander Mc Gregor received the Silver Star. What make this movie really authentic was the ORIGINAL USS Redfish was also used in the MOVIE. No Hollywood models. This is true USS Redfish ! For More Go to USS REDFISH web site. Read Story of ship and patrols. See Citation ! See Movie !!"
4,A MUST FOR WWII BUFFS,"Technically authentic down to jargon and tactics, all of the movie's shots are framed so that the real mechanical, working guts of the Gato Class sub can be seen in action. And none of the usual Hollywood bravado. The crewman sweat bullets, as they are driven against their will by their own Captain Ahab to seek revenge, to go where orders forbid them, to take on a target that should not be taken on. That target can move as fast as their torpedoes can run and can be hit only by drawing it into a dicey, down the throat shot to the bow. A well crafted, well paced, and tense film with great performances by Gable, Lancaster, and lots of well known character actors. Based on a novel by someone who served."
1,Sigh...,Cannot View in my area...the US. Never saw any notice that this DVD wasn't US viewable. Back it goes and I'll look for another version of this great movie.
5,One of the best submarine movies ever made,"Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster led their crew on a hunt for a Japanese sub killer. Lieutenant Bledso (Lancaster) expects to given the command of the sub but it goes to Commander Richardson (Gable) and this causes tension withing the boat. Good supporting cast, Jack Warden and Don Rickles to name a few."
2,Features not as described,"I like this movie, but specifically wanted the wide screen (letterbox) version. This movie was advertised as wide screen and even the package claims that the movie is wide screen. It is NOT!!!!!! When the movie begins, a message comes up stating that the movie has been altered and it is regular screen. Had I known this, I most definitely would NOT HAVE ORDERED this movie.I don't know if the seller knew the true state of the movie, but I am NOT HAPPY!!!!! Apparently what is written on these pages and even on the package cannot be believed!"
4,the root of Das boot,"This film started the saga of das boot, crisom tide and other great submarine movies. The cast ""lancaster, Gable"" is so powerfull.. they make the movie. I must imagine when it first came out in those days... it must have create such a tention in the theater... it`s still very present in today's movie technic.Another great 2hr of entertainment"
4,I enjoyed this DVD very much,I purchased this DVD for the naval action scenes. Even through almost all naval scenes where made using models I still enjoyed the action scenes very much. I would recommend the film with the caveat that there is very little WWII film footage in the picture.
4,"One of the best ""silent service"" films","This has always been one of my very favorite WW2 films. It is very authentic in it's depiction of the silent service. Gable is at his very best, once you hear him shout ""Lookouts below, clear the bridge, dive! dive!"", nobody else will ever be able to say those words with the same conviction and intensity as Gable!!"
4,Good plot - good production,"Not in my top 20 of WWII flicks, but it's in the neighborhood. I was impressed by the interior sets, and the scale of the water to the models. Black and white with good tonal range. Full screen format on one side of the disc - a widescreen (but letterboxed / matted) version on the other side."
4,Some movies just sort of fool you...,"This is a movie I saw as a kid, and I didn't remember thinking it was anything special. Well, I was wrong, as this is a very strong film, with very strong performances by the two lead actors. The action was very engaging and tense, and the question of this being another HMS Bounty...well, you have to watch it to figure that one out!"
1,Nostalgic,"Classic character struggle over duty and responsibilities to the ship and the service,values held by both men and the challenge of suddencircumstances of war at sea that bring out their respective fears and strengths. Excellent story; Lancaster and Gable move the viewer asonly great actora and good stories are able! Zeke"
1,You must be joking,"From a 2010 perspective, this movie seems incredibly simplistic and predictable - its main entertainment value, if any, is as camp comedy. The plot ""tension"" is laughable. I (and half a dozen friends) are very sorry that I picked this one from a pile of seven DVDs including Apocalypse Now and Zorba the Greek - both of which I have yet to see.Upon reflection, this movie reminded me of Hawaii Five O or the original Star Trek, in that they were great fun for a kid, but when nostalgia prompts a re-watching, they don't compare well to modern, more sophisticated fare.Some of the classics still are great. If you really are in the mood for a submarine movie, watch Das Boot (subtitled, not dubbed). Outstanding."
5,Yummy,given a gift card and bought this with the ham while unemplyed very good delicious buy it excellent cheese buy now !!!!! its good
1,NO MOVING PICTURES,"This item barely qualifies as a video dvd. The performance is not shown in any way. Instead, still photos of Venice are shown as the music plays. Many of the photos were taken at either sunrise or sunset and don't show a lot of color. Photos of very indifferent quality - kind of stuff YOU could do while walking around Venice with some decent equipment. As the program dragged on, they ran out of color photos and started showing reproductions of what looked like drawings of Venice.No interactive features."
3,Man becomes zen monk while working at a large company,"I think the title is misleading. It may better be labeled ""Man Becomes Zen Monk While Working in a Good Position at a Large Company."" I was expecting a more generic coverage of what ""American"" Buddhism might be about, especially Zen and capitalism/competition or even more detail about his progress via zazen. I was also disappointed that he did not elaborate on his feelings about his master's death (he brought it up and immediately dropped it) and at his suggestion that a male Zen Buddhist would have the ability to make a woman not feel like she was ""taken for granted."" Enlightenment is knowing oneself and not necessarily others but in that latter point I felt he missed all that that complaint may emcompass. At that juncture the book lost me."
1,ti è piaciuto Adult Themes for Voice?,"bene non dubito possa piacerti anche questo.come ha detto una mia amica si potrebbe ascoltare 'sto cd a una di quelle mostre post-qualcosa-che-era-già-pre... non certo in casa.se poi aveste l'ardire di ascoltarlo in casa, ad alto volume, non lamentatevi se arrivano i carabinieri.cazzo i vicini si son spaventati, e lo credo bene.anzi sentiste di questi rumori provenire dall'appartamento affianco e non vi preoccupaste di avvisar la forza dell'ordine sareste proprio degli insensibili autistici asociali che non meritano la previdenza sociale."
1,Very difficult reading,"Unless you come from a strong marketing background, this is not the book for you. It uses a large mix of marketing and hybrid Internet-ish marketing terms that are very hard to understand. I'm using this book for class as a requirement towards an E-commerce/Web Administration degree and this will definately be one of the books I sell back to the bookstore after this term is done.One funny example the books gives is about domain names. They blame the downfall of Time Warners Pathfinder website on it's choice of a domain name .... Hello, what does Yahoo! have to do with a portal? What does amazon have to do with selling books? What does The Hun have to do with porn? Yet these sites are the biggest ones in their respective markets.There are many websites (free I might add) that can teach you more about marketing on the internet than this book can in it's random dribbling incoherent format."
5,Hats Off!,"...not just red hats either! What a delightfully fun read. A host of quirky characters, a devilish villain and a perfectly breezy setting. This is perfect for Fall evenings - find a cozy chair, a nice lit fireplace and a warm cup of cider and treat yourself to the charm of Peggy Darty's SANDPIPER. You won't be disappointed."
4,Good mystery,"I realy enjoyed this book. It is a true ""curl up on a rainy afternoon and get cozy"" type of book. i am planning on reading more of this authors books."
1,Ideology disguised as science,"The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) is the research arm of Planned Parenthood, and exists to give the patina of scientific respectability to Planned Parenthood ideology. Abortion and Women's Health is yet another example of this ideology disguised as science. However, the canny reader can still glean some useful data from this publication, keeping in mind that the authors' interpretation of the data is dubious at best. This publication is worth buying only for the hard-core abortion researcher."
5,The art of Living Treasure Chest,I have not read this book. I've been trying to find it for a long long time. If any person that reads this can help me I really would appreciate it. I would like to have the essay The Art of Marriage. And this essay appeared in his book The art of living treasure chest. It would mean a lot to me.I thank you all.
4,We love this Carol King album!,It has all of our favorite Carol King songs and they are fairly nice arrangements. The only problem I have with it is that the book is not the same arrangements as the recording; They've watered down the accompaniment a bit so the melody can be included more easily in the piano. I would really like to have just the accompaniment as it is recorded on the tapestry album to play on the piano and sing along.
2,Not worth money,"Had this item for 4 months, until the component inputs on it broke inside, thereby not working anymore. Has been sitting on my shelf ever since, collecting dust."
4,Just what I needed.,"The right price; does the right job. The slightest fault might be that the connections and bonus cables are not gold plated, but this wasn't used on higher end equipment so there was no noticeable visual or audio degradation. I needed an inexpensive video selector that works with component connections and this was just what I needed. The bonus cables made it a great value too."
3,Beware of Input 4...,"This is a great product for a great price - but you should be aware that if you have an older tv, or a tv that doesn't have multi-video mode capability (video 1, video 2, etc.) you will not be able to use the front Input 4 - so you can only actually use it for 3 peripherals, which is a bit annoying for me."
2,Fair,"I wouldnt recommend buying this. The packaging was cheap. The product all around feels cheap, crappy plastic material, feels like something you would buy at a dollar store if you know what I mean. Definately wouldnt recommend buying this product."
5,"Great inexpensive hardware, Does HD","I purchased the PL-970, although my package does not specifically state it works in HD. I assumed (correctly) that it was just wire connections. The system is hardware (physical switching) and does not require power. Easy and simply to set up. Works great with my Wii and Xbox360. I saw other similar switch box options that were just over $100. This is definitely a steal in comparison."
1,You get what you pay for,"Every time I hook my Xbox 360 up to it, I get interference (screen flickers, lines, etc.) I'm going to keep looking for a good switcher, because this one ain't it."
1,Ok if you have a regular TV.. or dont care about quality.,"i thought this device would be fine. Instead, it degrades the quallity of the picture. I've had it a month, and its already coming apart.Doesnt work for HD. dont waste your time."
3,GK3: Highly Disappointing,"While I found the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau very interesting, if I'd had any idea what the rest of the game was going to be like, I would have just read a book on the subject. To try and phrase it without any real spoilers.. anybody who prefers Grace to Gabriel, or is interested in the building romantic tension between Gabriel and Grace, content yourself with the first two games--which I felt surpassed this one in almost every other area, as well. Frankly, if I still had my receipt, I'd write Sierra and ask them to give my money back."
4,"GK3, a great game, but not the equal of 1 or 2","I really wanted to love this game the way I loved the first and second in the series, but...in the end, I just don't. It's a great mystery marred by a lack of truly interesting characters (pretty much only Gabe, Grace, and Mose are interesting) and by a rotten pacing. The tension never really starts to build until it's almost too late, and even then it's not up to the kind of delicious tension and suspense the first two games displayed. Is it a good game? Oh yes. The gameplay is marvellous, it's so neat to explore a fully 3D world in an adventure game and to be able to view things from any given angle, but...it's not the equal of the first two in story, pacing, suspense, or character. The mystery is very well done, but the story around it could've been a lot better. STill worth playing if you're a fan!"
4,GK3,"I thought the sotry of the game was very good. As with the other GK games, there's a lot of history to wade through, however I found it very fun. The only thing I didn't like was the graphics. I think they could have spent more time on that. The movies in between some of the chapters were the same polygonic 3D images from the game instead of realistic movies. There is also a lot of religion in the game (many different types), but it's not telling you what's right or wrong.It's worth the money, buy the 3D is sometimes annoying."
1,Not for the klutzy,"I gave up in chapter one. I was completely unable to do anything except eventually get Gabriel out of doors where I promply got turned around and lost. I never made it any further due to sheer frustration.I loved the first 2 games. The first was cartoony but really interesting and logical. The second had a really swoony Gabriel,a great plot, beautiful scenery and camera work. The only problem there was the werewolf scene near the end. The game froze up every time I used the talisman and I could not finish.Never the less, I looked forward to the 3rd part. I am not coordianated enough to be anything but dizzy in this format. However, I suspect that for those who can use the 3d format that they will love the game. Just not for us oldfashioned non-tech people."
1,"Spit on the Sacred, Hail to the Damned.","As a longtime fan of the Gabriel Knight series, I was so looking forward to playing this game. In spite of the troubles I'd heard plagued the new 3d world, I was rarin' to go on a new adventure with Gabe and Grace. Imagine my disappointment, then, when I found almost no storytelling at all. The puzzles were nothing to write home about, either. And Tim Curry was sadly miscast as Gabe. Still, I was gonna tough it out, just to see what happened. Was I in for a shock! I spend all this time wading through a sea of mediocrity, only to have this game tell me that my God is dead, and my faith is a lie! Not wanting to take the chance that some other poor fool might possibly play my copy after I threw it away, I actually broke the CDs first. This game was one of the greatest letdowns I've experienced in 10 years of PC gaming."
2,"I hate to say it, but...","I very much enjoyed GK2, so I was surprised at the letdown of GK3. I was looking forward to it so much that I bought it when it was released versus after the price goes down (I'm a poor grad student).The game was slow, there was little ""adventure,"" the characters movements were stiff (Gabriel walks like he has a pole up his butt), the puzzles were obscure, and the graphics weren't nearly as great as they were touted to be. But perhaps the most annoying thing about GK3 was Tim Curry's rendition of a Southern drawl. Besides the grating voice, many of the things he said were just stupidly insulting.If a GK4 comes out, I'll be waiting for it to be in the sale bin, if I buy it at all."
5,Continuing to Improve,"This is by far the best Gabriel Knight adventure to come. The puzzles are simple enough to be solved by those who don't like to think, but are difficult enough to keep people involved in the game. The new environment gives a whole new feel to the game and makes the player feel more involved with what is happening than ever. The many twists and characters constantly keep you guessing as to whom the kidnappers could be. I definately recommend this game to anybody who is a fan of the GK series. Let's pray that Sierra doesn't stop with this one."
3,"A great plot and execution, bad riddle","The GK3 is a good game. As in the previous games, GK is investigating an ocult mystery set in France. The interactivity of the game is good, the plot is intriguing and encourages you to do more research on teh subject. However, the riddles are sometimes too complicated, leaving the player at a loss. At one point I began to wonder what the point of all this is. Anotehr somewhat annoying thing in the game was that shortcuts are not available for a lot of the places, GK or Grace should go to. There is a map that gets yout o different locations in the region, however, you have to walk around the town every time you want to visit a different building within the town. While I understand taht this is done on purpose--you collect clues on the way, players should have an option to skip these steps and minimize wasting time watching GK walk the same streets a hundred times before the game is over."
1,A different opinion,"I love adventure computer games, but I had a very different reaction to this one than the other reviewers. First of all, there wasn't much ""adventure"" to this adventure - I thought the story was pretty slow. But most importantly, this game had the most obscure (and in my opinion) ridiculous puzzles I have encountered in an adventure game.Also, I found the hero both annoying and unlikable. Among other things, he's supposed to be from New Orleans, and his accent is so bad that I found it distracting. In the game's initial movie, I could swear the character is British, but during the game sequences his accent is ""Southern on steriods.""Suffice it to say this is the first adventure game I have ever purchased that I had no interest in finishing. Normally, I can't be dragged away from them.Go figure."
1,What happened?,"I bought the GK2 and was blown away.Felt as if I knew the characters and cheered for them.In this I didn't like them at all. Snappy, sarcastic, horrendous voice jobs. I waited on this one but won't on the next. Slow moving, no mystery since the characters are not as developed. Will never buy a game again untill the price is reduced. WHAT Happened?"
3,Boring!,"Decent graphics. Great story. Annoying, repetitive characters. Slow story progression. Very annoying puzzles that require you to perform the perfect action at the perfect time in the perfect spot. If you want action, look elsewhere. If you've got time to wander around the same rooms over and over trying to figure out what you missed or whether you did everything in the right order, you've hit the jackpot. There are certainly worse games out there, but there are better ones as well."
2,Anticipation turns to disappointment...,"I couldn't wait for this game to come out. Then, as I began to play, I found myself really annoyed by the extreme slowness of the gameplay -- especially when Gabriel has to, for instance, walk back to his motorcycle -- and by the absolute poisonousness of his character as portrayed in this game. When did Gabriel get to be such a lunk? I was overjoyed whenever I got to a Grace section so that I didn't have to listen to Gabriel's obnoxious banter any longer. The game is only marginally entertaining, and the graphics are downright ugly."
5,Bring on GK4!,"From when Sierra and Jane Jensen first started this series; the first game was slow moving and out of sync characters, their second was a 'real time' set of characters in a acual settings, and now the third installment is OUTSTANDING! This game is well thought out, good storyline, original Gab from the first series(Tim Curry) as well as some other topline actors lend their voices to create a believable 3-D Adventure Game. Although the game has been out for nearly 2 years now, I, myself, have played the game now 3 different times. There is always something that may have been overlooked and/or undone. I am still awaiting an ever hopeful GK4 from Jane Jensen!! Not to be missed for all Gabriel Knight fans! If you are a first timer to Adventure games or to Jane Jensen; there is no need to first play the previous two games before playing this game...as it is easy to 'drop-in' on the series. Well worth every penny."
5,I love these series!,I did like this game! I did not find it boring at all. There should be more games like this where you can have all these dialogs with the characters and you can explore different places and pick up your clues. It really makes you feel like you are part of the game!I didn't mind Tim Curry's voice. The only thing I was not too pleased was with the graphics. I'm not too fond of these new type of graphics that make all the faces look like rectangles or triangles. But the game is just great. Let's hope for a Gabriel Knight 4 to come soon!
5,Buy it!,"Watching this special on PBS has cemented Mrs. Roosevelt as one of, if not, THE, finest of my own personal heroines whom I admire very much. It made me feel like a better person just watching it. But despite many setbacks in her personal life, she rose up to selflessly inspire a great many people from all walks of life on a global scale who benefit from her tireless work, even today."
5,a book not to be missed,"Mathematicians and lovers of algebra: this is it. This has been the best algebra book I have seen since the mid 1980s. The explanations and proofs are clear and easy to follow. One could only wish that other authors could write like prof. Cohn does. it is extremely unfortunate that the publisher (Wiley & Sons) has kept this book, and the other two (Algebra vol.2 and vol.3) out of stock and/or out of print for so long. Maybe one day these three books will once again be more accessible in the US."
5,outstanding book,"The book is a great historical work with outstanding story telling. Makes it as if you know Lord Nelson and sailed in the British fleet. I highly recommend this book to mariners, sea history lovers, and sailors of all sorts. The pictures, paintings, and charts/maps are superb."
5,Great Service,We like this book as it provides simple and fun way to learn SAT words. Also the service was excellent and the book arrived on time.
3,Okay.,"This book is okay. It does contain some flaws. I think it would help me remember the words better if it had some visual aid. I recommend using SAT Vocabulary Cartoons better. Some of the ideas could have been made up easily by myself. It tends to get a bit wordy sometimes. Otherwise, this book could be a little bit useful."
4,Umm...this is pretty good but...,This is a pretty good vorcabulary learning book but not every word has a picture to go along with it and it's sometimes confusing to follow along with the picture. You also need to be dedcated to learning these vorcabulary because not every word can be remebered through pictures.
5,Bible Stories With A Twist,"What a great book to read aloud to your children or grandchildren. At first these stories recount the traditional Bible stories, then it turns with a different ending.For example in the story about the birth of Jesus Christ. The book says, ""This baby named Jesus was God's Son. Mary knew Jesus was a pretty special kid."" Then you turn the page and it says, ""So she hired a big-shot agent, held a huge press conference, and told the world of the newborn King of God's people."" You turn the page and have the huge words, ""Hey, That's Not What the Bible Says!"" Then it gives the biblical end to the story about Jesus' birth.The artwork and the words combine to make this book a winner. Kids will sit in anticipation and at the appropriate place say aloud as you read it, ""Hey, That's Not What the Bible Says!""Bill Ross has created a winner with this book."
5,The BEST gift for little girls,"My two year old daughter was given this by my mother-in-law and it has not left her side since. It has a great vanilla smell to her that has not faded even after countless baths. She has soft beans inside her torso and dries within several hours after a bath if you just hang her up. There is a tiny cloth hook on her back just for that. We don't have any of the clothes to go on her but the can be bought for her 12"" size from the same company."
2,Didn't work for us!,"I used these once when my son was a size two and they seemed fine. Recently, I ordered them in a size 4 since the price was good. For the first two nights, they leaked everywhere including the gel out of them. It was pretty gross. I will use them during the day until they are gone and won't buy them again. I hear babies are different though when it comes to diapers. My best friend ONLY uses these and the rest leak for her.I am going back to my Costco diapers."
3,One of Many Versions of the Life and Times of Aristotle Onassis,"After having read the biography of Maria Callas, I felt compelled to find out more about the love of her life, Ari Onassis. Although he was very intelligent, his drive was what lead him to succeed and to make choices that left him, in the end, very unhappy. The writer of this book was hand picked by Onassis even though Ari already had a biography that he had previously endorsed. The book was very interesting and also insightful. It has everything from his rise to power, his marriages, his affairs, and most importantly, his children and their lives."
5,Any University's Library Is Incomplete Without This Volume,"As the Undersecretary for New Acquisitions at a prestigious New England institution of higher learning, I have to say that any current events or political science collection would be incomplete without this tremendously thorough study of such an intriguing Cold War subject.Mr. Peterson has gone to great lengths to research and develop a compelling and interesting story. I highly recommend this book for any college or university library and will include it on my next list of recommendations for history books in the New England College of Library Science Monthly Newsletter."
5,Outstanding Guidebook,"I used an earlier edition of this book on a trip in 1996, in which I visited the Seychelles, Mauritius, and Reunion. I was travelling independently (not as part of a package tour) and the book helped in many ways to make my trip a great one. It provides a wealth of information about hotels and restaurants, island culture, and places and things to see on the islands. If you can only visit one of these three islands, I would recommend the Seychelles, which offer some of the finest tropical scenery I have ever seen. One advantage of Mauritius for the budget-minded traveler is that it is considerably less expensive than the Seychelles."
5,Great book!,"This is a wonderful book, full of great stories that convey the limits of our ability to control our cognition. Wegner's data is compelling, the treatment is fun to read, and most importantly, an amazing scientific case is presented about psychology that is inconsistent with our intuition. Anyone who thinks that social scientists study the obvious will easily find data to the contrary in The Illusion of Conscious Will."
2,Pretty thin gruel,"I had two problems with this book. First, a stylistic complaint - I found the writing to be much too self-consciously cute. If you're going to write about serious topics, then do so in a serious way. Second, the author's approach consists of constructing one straw man argument after another and then demolishing it. He did not seem to be addressing any serious theoretic perspectives on conscious will, rather he seemed more interested in proving that the idea of conscious will is simply silly on its face and proceeds from there.A good and extremely important topic, but flawed execution."
5,Fantastic book!,"Dan Wegner has done it again. The Illusion of Conscious Will is a brilliant, funny, entertaining, insightful book on a question of fundamental importance to psychology, philosophy, theology, and everyday life: To what extent are we the authors of our own actions? Is there such a thing as conscious will, or is it illusion? If there is conscious will, how would we know it? Wegner shines a bright light on these age-old questions, most importantly by showing that they are open to investigation by the experimental psychologist. Wegner is the rarest of combinations--a brilliant theorist, ingenious experimenter, and wonderful writer. This book is a must read."
1,Kangaroo Court more like it!,"""The Hague"" was created as a means to justify the US/UK's bombing of the Serbian population - they bombed them in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. The court is anti-Serbian and is seen as a Kangaroo Court, not an international court of justice! If it were after justice it would also deal with the issue of the illegal bombing of Serbia by the US/UK - no not interested in that. Therefore don't be interested in this book as the title and contents is hypocritical!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I thought this would be a wonderful box set but instead was very disappointed. The major problem here is the sequencing of the songs. This would be a much better collection if it was in chronological order. As it is, it is a very tough listen. Also the choice of songs is very WRONG! The unreleased rare stuff is uneven and certainly not good as what is on Bootleg Vol. 1-3. The live version of Isis is AWFUL!!"
5,Great work,"Apart from an excellent description of a scientific theory for the benefit of the informed layman, it is also a fascinating story of the trials and tribulations of a great mind and how personal ego and preconceived notions of his colleagues made them blind to his epoch-making discoveries."
3,"Engrossing and lovely, but did he have a ghost writer?","Cloud Chamber is a thoroughly enjoyable story, written with the warmth and intelligence that make a Michael Dorris book remarkable, but I wasn't nearly as deeply touched by it as I was by A Yellow Raft In Blue Water. I found myself reading quickly, just to find out what the characters would do next, instead of savoring the sentences as I did when I read and re-read A Yellow Raft.Several scenes in the book - scenes that involved several women of various generations talking or cooking together - were so similar in circumstance and, most especially, in tone to scenes in some of Louise Erdrich's (Mr. Dorris's wife) novels that I was really startled by their resemblance. I'm very curious to know if any other readers noticed this"
5,One of the best New Soul acts of 2005.,"This is what Neo-Soul should be! A lot of Folks turn up their noses at the ""Neo-Soul"" tag, but they don't understand that there is a complex method to truly acheiving the title. Some New soul artist are so hip-hop influenced and topical that they lose the emotion and complexity of the old school soul. Other acts reach so far into the past that they get lost and their albums sound like a cheap rip-off of a dusty old crate of soul records. Devaughn is the perfect blend of both schools. With samples from ""EW&F"", ""Switch"", and ""The Isleys"" he channels classic soul, and with his poeticly delivered lyrics and fresh beats he takes his place in The leaders of Neo-Soul. His voice is smooth, comfortable and relaxed, but well capable of powerful delivery. The only weakness to the entire album is ""Sweet Tooth"" which is a half-decent stab at a more up-tempo song withn a club romance senario theme, but even that track is somewhat pleasurable. Definatley a strong debut."
4,Chill Music,"I waited for months for this CD to come out & when I finally bought it, I was not dissapointed. Raheem's voice is incredible, the music is smooth..what more can you ask for? My favorites on the cd have to be ""Guess who love you"" & ""You"". He is one of those artist that you can feel the words & the music just soothes your soul. Great cd..."
4,Grand debut,I honestly found this cd by chance. I was going through amazon as I tend to do a lot of times looking for something new and happend upon Mr. Devaugh. I can say that wasn't disappointed after sampling his music on amazon. About a week later oddly enough the c.d was on sale at circuit city for 8.99 so I rushed out to get it. All I can say is I'm happy I did and it's definitely a keeper. The Love Experience is just that and more. Raheem's singing style is great mellowed out over hip hop beats. He tends to groove over most of his tracks and puts a listener in the mode of vibin. I gave it four stars only because I felt like some of the writing may have been a bit better on the cd if he had more time before the release as far as the input. It's definitely worth the buy and the whole album is a personal favorite.
5,A WONDERFUL TALENT,"I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO RAHEEM DEVAUGHN FOR MAKING SUCH A DIFFERNET AND WONDERFUL ALBUM. ""THE LOVE EXPERINCE"" IS DEFINATELY ONE OF THE BEST SOULFUL ALBUMS. AND IF YOU EVERY GET A CHANCE TO WITNESS THIS BROTHER LIVE, GO SEE HIM! THE LIVE SHOW IS ALL THAT."
4,Great Album,"This album is a great album. Raheem is one of a few talented SOUL singers out now. This album is great from beginnining to end. From the singing to the lyrics to the beats this album was well produced and well worth it. I would recommend it to anyone who is seeking out real soulful, good music. He also addresses various topics on the album, not just love."
4,For Neo-Soul Lovers,This cd is one of my new favorites! It's got a good mix of slow jams and faster tempo songs.
2,DECENT,"This is a really cool CD. this kid plays has adopted a style from Prince and Marvin Gaye. If there was one thing to improve this piece, it must be some ""Originality""."
2,"THE ""NO LOVE EXPERIENCE"" OK, WHERE DO I START?","I hate to be the ""Anti-DeVaughn"" but I just wasn't feeling this cat. His poetic interludes sounded forced and fake to some extent and the musical content didn't really impress me. He seemed like he was getting off on his own steelo and I just didn't feel the vibe like everyone else has. I mean, I WANTED to like the brotha but I just didn't vibe him. Maybe next time."
2,about a 2.5,"dude has Talent.good usage of live instrumentation&Songwriting,but like alot of other artists on the Neo Soul tip He just doesn't have any idenity of his own yet.time will tell.some cool ideas&whatnot,but nothing really stands out for me,but in His Musical Favor He has a strogn Upside I truyl Believe."
4,Fascinating stuff,"Lovely and intriguing little booklet. It's one of the few really original publications available in astrology, and represents someone's precious research. Fascinating stuff, but you'll need to know astrology to understand it--although it is possible to order a report that will make it unnecessary for actually using the method."
1,Dr. Long doesn't understand that God is HOLY,"Dr. Long has a problem with God's holiness. His lack of understanding of justice due to sin and wrongdoing is clear. We'd all agree if someone murdered our child and the judge allowed the murderer to go free, that would be wrong. Because God is a holy God (set apart, without sin, pure) AND He is just there must be a consequence for sin. God is love but He is also just yet full of mercy. Justice and Mercy meet at the cross of Jesus when God became man took upon Himself our consequence for our sin. So justice was served, yet mercy was given -- He took His own wrath (justice) upon Himself (mercy). Only God can open the eyes of our hearts to see truth and not fester anger or bitterness, which blinds us to truth and God's love."
2,How NOT to format an e-book!,"My unsatisfactory rating for this book has nothing to do with its factual content. Agree with his beliefs or don't; but his premise is spot-on. My singular complaint is the layout of the book. It makes it a difficult read. There is no chapter breakdown. I read the first 20-pages thinking I was reading an introduction and hoping with each additional page that I'd soon come to a chapter one heading.It didn't happen. What's even worse is that there is virtually no white space. In fact, there isn't so much as a single line of white space between the ending of one topic, the title of the next topic, or the beginning of that topic."
4,Good over all,"Some good logic, but some of the quotations from the bible are inaccurate, when you look them up, the passage isn't there. That was frustating."
3,A Difficult Read,"Jason Long's book is a tough read. It is not very well written...stilted, repetitive in parts and not always convincing in its arguments. Nevertheless, he attacks the Bible on multiple fronts with relentless, mostly logical and detailed criticism. It's clear he knows his stuff. If you can stick with it, you will learn a lot about the Bible and its obvious contradictions and errors. The overwhelming conclusion that he draws: The Bible was not written by an inerrant God. Either He made lots of mistakes and was ignorant, or it was written by humans, with all the ignorance and superstition of their time. He hammers that point until any but the most devout believer would have to admit its truth.Too bad he didn't use a ghost writer."
3,Good but hardly original,"This is a simple book, but that doesn't mean bad: it's simple and effective and it puts in front of the reader a series of indisputable facts. It's not very original, because many other books have stated similar things, but as a primer for doubting people is quite good and to the point."
4,Biblical Nonsense: A Review Of The Bible For Doubting Christians,"A good read, kept me interested 'till the end. Modern scientific understanding has added much to enlightenment and our place in a lonely universe."
1,Amateurish,"This book is terribly written. The organization and formatting is downright irritating and his overly pompous language is very annoying. The book doesn't even have chapters(!) It is just a litany of facts, almost in random order, which are not tied together in any consistent theme, so one is forced to go to the Bible and read the referenced texts and deduce for himself some consistency of message. He makes his many points over, and over, and over. An especially annoying part was early in the book when he explained, for no apparent reason, the many types of argument (IN LATIN!). Why??? To impress the reader? It not only added nothing to the book, it was probably a reason for many readers to simply chuck the book. I almost did.I suggest the writer use this manuscript as notes for writing an actual book.BTW, I agree with a great deal of what I could make out of this set of notes."
5,Biblical Nonsense,This tome reviews the basic reasons the Bible is of doubtful origen. It is well researched and finely written by the author.
2,Only useful for attacking the lowest level of Evangelical Fundamentalism,"While this book contained some worthwhile material, Dr. Long's rebuttal of Christianity and the Bible is against the lowest level of anti-intellectual Evangelicalism. His understanding of the Bible is no better than your average, untrained fundamentalist. The rational he is attempting to defeat has been forsaken by Christians outside of the Evangelical Bible belt.While his venture is worthwhile, it has been done with much greater veracity and consideration for the more intellectually affluent Christian apologist."
1,Nothing new,"Seems to me I've heard that song before....in Mills, Hitchens, Dawkins et al. I found it a rehash of much that has gone before."
1,Save your money!!,"This is precisely the kind of empty sophistry and pseudo intellectual drivel that passes for critical thinking in this post-modern age. Sadly this author is precisely as described in Scripture as one who is wise in his own eyes but incapable of coming to a knowledge of truth despite his ""much learning"". If this work had any scholastic merit it would have been picked up by a real publisher of Academia."
1,"Research is Needed, Doctor Long.","From the introduction:""Even more lethal to the Christian cause is the unoriginal nature of Jesus Christ himself. Around 3000 BCE, the ancient Egyptians had the Sun God Trinity of Atum (father), Horus (son), and Ra (holy spirit).""Wrong. Dr. Long shows his ignorance of Egyptology. Statements similar to this abound on the internet, and misinformation like this has spread because of idiots with publications.More poorly-founded statements just like this one are just a paragraph away. If you're going to waste my time, Jason, do it on a medium better suited to you. May I suggest YouTube?"
4,Very Good !!!!!,This is a great book. It is a must read for critical thinkers. This book uses science and logic to debunk some of the foolish stories in the bible.
4,A well thought out analysis,"Insightful, detailed and merciless analysis of contradictions and straight out falsehoods and impossibilities contained within the collection of books called the Bible. The suthor is clearly a committed non-believer who's strong feelings often drift into sarcasm and ridicule of the concept of a ""loving god"" who, if the Bible is taken at face value, has done much evil and routinely acts like a petulant child. Still, the points raised are well thought out and difficult to explain away. Should be read by all thinking adults reagrdless of religious affiliation."
4,"a hard game, but very fun","This game was a very hard one for my brother and myself to play. The storyline goes along perfectly with the movie. The graphics are great, but the sound seems a little rushed. This game is a very good game to play, and if you have seen the movie, it makes it better."
5,Great kids' game,"I don't know what those people up there who gave this game one star were talking about. What would you expect? This game is geared towards kids but it's very playable for anyone else who isn't into the blood n guts killing fighting racing type of games. I play alot of those games but this was even challenging for me, but yet my little brother can play it too. It's got awesome graphics and sounds great. Anyone who liked the movie will absolutely love this game."
3,frustration,"This game is extremely frustrating. You have to repeat tasks over and over again. On the good side, you have an unlimited numer of lives..."
1,Bad Buy!,This is a bad buy. The idea was great but it came out horrible. The graphics ... and the gameplay isn't that fun.
1,This product stinks!,It was a waste of money. It stopped working after using it one time! Do not buy!
3,A good treatment of Calvinisitic predestination,Sproul does a good job of explaining the Calvinistic view of predestination. I don't agree with it. But I still appreciate the work he has done to explain it.
2,"Would be better titled ""Calvinism Is Right Just Because""","I am a big fan of R.C. Sproul, listen to his radio show every day, and have several of his books. When I turned to this offering from Bro. Sproul on the sticky problems of predestination and election, I was stunned - there's a lot of eloquent language here, but no explanations.If you're a Calvinist, this book just covers the basics of Calvinist doctrine and cites the verses to back it up. If you're not a Calvinist, there's nothing here for you. The verses which contradict Calvinism are not addressed and not mentioned. The book goes in circles for many pages and finally ends up not giving you any satisfactory answers on the subject. I know Bro. Sproul is capable of much deeper explanation than this, perhaps he just wanted to keep it simple, but in doing so, he failed to really address the question - are we chosen by God or do we choose God? Despite the title, the answer to that question isn't in Bro. Sproul's book."
2,"If This Is Simple, So Am I!","I eagerly read this book as part of a study on predestination due to the promotion of it as a ""simple, clear"" exposition of a complex subject. My experience was not so glowing. I could not even understand what Sproul believes on the subject! It vascillates between the presentation of various viewpoints to the extent that I could not follow the path back to ""home base."" Clear as mud to me.Discouraged as I read these other reviews, I can only conclude that I need to read it again."
1,An inhumane idea,"The one thing I do appreciate about this book is that it is consistent with what the New Testament teaches about salvation. At least this guy has the guts to stick to his guns having embraced biblical inerrancy. It is also not surprizing that this idea would be glorified. If faith is embraced as a valid epistimological procedure- anything goes. Practically speaking, Sproul, and the NT bring to the world a message that is one level lower than nihilism. The amazing thing is that good men and women have bought into this idea, hook, line and sinker. I read this book because this is the kind of thing my neices are being taught. This breaks my heart."
4,Intro to Calvinism,"I found it to be a fantastic read. It's scripturally based, but incredibly logical and difficult to argue with.Calvinism is a theology that RC Sproul subscribes to and teaches. This book is not about Calvinism, per se, but rather just one part - the building block - of Calvinism, and that's whether God chooses you or you choose Him.After much research on the topic, I've found flaws with Calvinism as a whole, but not with this premise or book. I believe it to be Theologically sound."
5,Five Stars,"***** The most contraversial issue among Christians might not be predestination, but that is certainly one of the main ones. When God began His plans for the world, did He randomly choose some to find salvation through the grace of Christ, or is it all up to us? In this mini-book, the author carefully spells out the three dominant views held by Christians, Augustine's, Pellagianism, and semi-Pellagianism. Though the third is the most dominant view, that does not necessarily make it the true one. Even if you go into this book by holding fast to a contrary belief, before the last page closes, you will find yourself having to consider the other side. Though brief, each word packs a tremendous punch and gives readers much to think about, even too much. *****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
4,Good basic introduction to the Doctrines of Grace,"This book communicates very effectively and is not difficult to read. It is very convincing with regard to the arguments for a proper doctrine of predestination. My only complaint is that there are some tough questions which it does not address as effectively as John Piper's ""The Pleasures of God"". I recommend both books, but Chosen by God may be better for beginners in this field of study."
5,sproul is great at explaining reformed theology,"I have recently focused my studies on Reformed Theology, particularly through the writings of Sproul, Horton, Piper, Lewis, & MacAuthor. Sproul is among the best at articulating the Reformed position, however, R.W. Skepple does an even better job in his classic 'Doctrines of Grace'. Both works are indispensible!"
3,RC Sproul on the doctrine of election,"This is a good book. Sproul's thesis is that God chose individuals to be saved before the beginning of time, and that he chose to pass the others by. He stops short of saying that God predestined them to go to hell, but by saying that God chose to pass them by, it doesn't leave the poor blokes who were passed by a whole lot of alternative.And there are scripture passages which teach almost the opposite of what Sproul is saying. I'm thinking of 2 Peter 3:9 which says that that Lord doesn't want anyone to perish, but that all should come to repentance. And 1 Timothy 2:4 says that ""God wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth."" These scriptures in my understanding present a far more compassionate picture of the Christian God than what Sproul has presented.But differences of opinion aside, Sproul has done a fine job of presenting a traditional Calvinist position on the doctrines of election and reprobation."
5,Blown away by this book.,"I just began reading this book and I am not a Calvinist. I consider myself, after much study, prayer and thought, Arminian. However, I am not closed minded and am willing to listen to another's view on such matters and, if convinced otherwise, I'll change my position. I bought this book because of its high rating and received it yesterday. I began reading it and can not put it down. After about 20 pages, I turned to the back of the book to see what other books he had written. I am blown away at Sproul's honesty, clarity and reasoning. I found myself saying, aloud, ""Wow"" - and I'm only on page 25."
5,"A logical, well-written book","Anyone who has ever scoffed at the doctrine of predestination, as I once did, should read this book. This doctrine, without a doubt, gives God all the glory."
4,I missed this little show!,"I remember when Degrassi High and Degrassi Jr. High aired in the U.S and I really enjoyed it. I came on in my region in the late 1980's when I was in JHS. My mother did not care for it because she felt the kids were too fast acting. But she obviously did not understand what it was like to be a teen in the 1980s. That little show did a nice job of portraying teens realisticly (spelling?) and it had some nice storylines. I may be biased since I enjoy ""soaps"" but this show was so much better than 90210,Saved By the Bell and Degrassi probably had half the budget. The kids looked like kids from my neighborhood and it did a nice job of being diverse without feeling contrived. I plan to get the DVD edition if it is available."
4,A must for Sondheim fans,"I'd heard of this documentary and was thrilled to be able to finally see it. A real ""behind the scenes"" documentary. While there's no continuous narrative, it's interesting to see the process and to later hear the commentary of Pennebaker, Prince and Stritch. You can see the joy the performers had singing these songs and you cheer when you hear Elaine Stritch sing a successful take of ""Ladies Who Lunch."" Recommended for those who loved Company, Sondheim completists and those who care about musical theatre."
2,Not as good as it could be,"COMPANY, Stephen Sondheim.I was looking forward to seeing the complete, uninterrupted shoowbut to my surprise[it does not say so in the advertisement], this is only a documentary showing the original cast, which is brilliant, and the individual songs which are all interrupted by narrative talk.If you are expecting a pleasurable entertainment which gives you an image of the musical, this is not for you, but on the other hand, there is no alternative.Joe Neustatl"
2,not what i expected,"I was expecting a video of the production,instead I got a documentary of the making of the audio recording.Interesting, but not what I was hoping for...and very short for a DVD. Obviously a made for TV documentary,not a record of the show."
5,This single is just dying to be on the airwaves!,"Jupiter is such a unique, powerful song, on the CD or the remix. Jewel made a wise decision redoing it for airplay- Jupiter is just dying to explode onto he charts and add to Jewel's many hit singles. Deep Water is a song that reflects on life and Emily is stunning. A true gem!"
5,I keep it in my car,This is a handy tool. I like the look and feel. I keep it in my car. My girlfriend likes it too!
5,I love these cards!,These cards are very powerful and beautiful. I have two other decks by Doreen Virtue and these are my favorite. You can feel the presence of these Archangels as soon as you begin to use these cards.
5,THE MOST,iS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. I DAILY CONSULT IT AND LOVE IT. I HAVE PURCHASED MINE AND NOW i AM GIVING THIS TO A FRIEND. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
3,Pretty good but ....,The thing with angel cards is that its unbalnced. The tarot tells you the good and the bad. Its called ying yan its balance. You half to take the good with the bad.
5,acurate,"I found this deck to be accurate. I use it as a clarifier when I'm not sure what my tarot says, one of these cards usually sums the reading up."
4,Never Alone,Truth can be subtle or engaging....these cards provide the doorway for each of us to decide which way to go. They are always on target and just having the vision of such a support team can move mountains that much sooner. We are all on call.. We know in our hearts this is not a fantasy. We go forward knowing such a team exists.
4,Nice Tool,The pictures on the cards are done very well. The deck comes with a neat handbook that elaborates on each cards message. I use them daily and they have helped me.
5,Always insightful,I love this deck! I had never really been attracted to/nor knew much about Angels or Archangels but since getting this deck... there's no turning back now! Every time I use these cards whether the reason be light-hearted or life-changing the information is always insightful. Highly recommended!
5,McNamara's whiz kids didn't had a clue,"In life when you have the means but lack the will to win(epitomized by your own government's actions) , you have a recipe for disaster,that's the message the author convey s in this excellent account of air war in Vietnam seen from the Carriers in the golf of Tonkin."
5,Completely Real,If you like books that will draw you into the real life of a girl on the wrong track then this is it. I read it in 2 days. When your parents lie to you your whole life about who your father is you would flip too. Harley is an artist who is in a swirl of lies and doesn't know what to do. Her friend pretty much leaves her to fend for her self and her parents act like they don't care. She meets a boy who takes her to parties and does drugs. That doesn't last long. She soon goes in search of who her real father is.This is a great book with a twist of an ending.
4,Harley like a confused little person...,"Harley like a person, by Cat Bauer is the story of a young teenage girl living in suburbia. She lives with her family but believes that she is adopted, so she goes on a long search for who her real father is. Harley goes on many intresting adventures, making new friends that don't turn out so great, her thoughts and feelings about everything... when you finish with the book you won't really surprised with the ending, but it is a really great story.I really liked it because Harley sounds like someone that lives in everyones head, she is very straightfoward and honest and she sais her everythoughts when something happens..( like how she felt the first time she tried pot...) I think that people should defenitly read this book, its funny, descriptive and beautiful.."
3,Real places and Real People,"Though I have not read this book, I have heard much about it. The town that Harley lives in is actually a reference to Pompton Lakes NJ, my home town, and her references to a place called ""The Pond Hole"" are real as well, it is in the bottom of our high school parking lot, and it's where people hang out to smoke ciggerettes and play hacky sack. A few current teachers at the high school are also referenced, just thought that was intresting."
3,Read On,"Karen Perry-Mondori, defense attorney, is the kind of hero with whom the reader can identify. She is tough without being hard, dedicated without ignoring her personal life. She personifies the ideal professional woman. The plot is intricately drawn and uses the always-popular theme of the ""underdog"" versus the monied and powerful. There are times when the story dips into the fantastic, but not enough to turn off the reader. Most of the characters are believable, though they sometimes behave in ways the reader may find extreme. It is easy to tell ""whodunnit,"" but we want to read on because we cannot be sure and are curious as to motive and method. Catherine Arnold is not yet a great writer, but if we watch her progress, we may one day find her so."
3,Not Very Sharp,"Not as sharp as a good carbide bit, but the small radius of the pilot makes it useful for rabbeting cabinet doors for glass."
5,A Must See For All Degrassi Fans!!,"I used to watch Degrassi when I was in like the 6th grade on PBS. I absolutely loved it~ then I forgot about it for many many years until now when I happened to catch it by mistake while flipping channels.I got hooked once again and was so glad to see that they made this final movie length finale.~ I was shocked to see them cursing and being bad like normal teenagers!! It was such a breath of fresh air. The story line was so well written and real. My faves were always Caitlyn and Joey~ and I was am so happy the movie mostly revolved around them. It would have been nice to see what happened to Melanie, Kathleen, Maya, Arthur, Dwayne (the kid that got AIDS). But I guess they weren't available to be a part of this super last episode.This movie is definitely a keeper! I am so glad I ordered it~ I hope to show this to my children one day.~"
2,"Good, But Not Good Enough","I like the movie because it stared the Degrassi cast, but it didn't give updates on all the characters, like Spike she was my favorite she only had a few lines. I think the writers should have made it a little more like the episodes (they were good). I really feel like I wasted money buying the movie I should have bought episodes instead."
3,Could have been better if..........,"As all youngsters, growing up in the 80's was pretty hard, with all the happy pants and slap wrist bands that were abundant with that era, there was also rat's tails and mullets that we had to endure too. Amongst all this was a tv show that never disappointed. At 5.30 We were fixed to the tele and became best friends with the kids of degrassi. We watched until the end and the movie eclipsed all the heartbreak and joy that we all lived through with the series. If you were someone like me, who loved the series, you would enjoy the movie. If you weren't, you would probably say something like, ""It could have been better if..."" Anyway, it's good for a laugh to see how bad fashion in the 80's was, and to see if Snake finally used some phisohex on that acute acne."
2,A quick observation,"Just about everybody says the same thing: ""Yeah, it wasn't a very happy ending, but sometimes real-life does not have happy endings, and that's what makes Shool's Out great"". Let me ask you this: If the Degrassi movie ended with a happy ending for all, would you have enjoyed it less? Closure? Are you kidding!? They left this thing wide open! I am looking forward to the upcoming reunion movie (in 2001), and yes I'd like to see a happy ending in spite of the fact that real-life sometimes deals us a bad hand (Sorry people, Degrassi is great, but it's not real life)."
5,School's Out,"I loved this tape!! It had a lot of drama and i loved the way it was written, even though i didn't like the outcome of the movie i still loved it."
1,Missing Parts TWICE!,"This review is only about how JET is incompetent in packaging up their Mill / Drill Unit. I still can not comment on the operation, as I still can not run the unit.When I first received this unit (frieght via CEVA), the box looked already pre-opened. After further inspection, I found that all of the parts required to assemble the unit were missing. I contacted Amazon, and Amazon immediately processed and shipped out a replacement unit. I just got the replacement unit. This time they have included a part box with instructions. However, the box only includes one handle knob, while there should be a total of four. What a joke and waste of time. Save your money, look elsewhere other than JET. Their Quality and Shipping is pathetic."
5,A truely enjoyable reading experience for kids and parents.,"My kids (8, 5, and 3) were delighted to find another Feliciana Feydra Leroux story. Like the first Feliciana story, this story also features a great antagonist for Feliciana. This time Feliciana is up against a Cajun werewolf, and there are some terrific illustrations that really bring him to life. I like the fact that Feliciana is a little girl who takes charge during her adventures. My kids (1 boy and 2 girls) just like the adventures. We also like the relationship between Feliciana and her brother, which is certainly reminiscent of sibling relationships everywhere. This is a story that kids love and parents can really enjoy reading. The language is marvelous, the story is engrossing, and the surprise ending is bound to delight. It's another wonderful Feliciana Feydra Leroux story. We highly recommend it, and we're waiting for the next adventure."
4,Really good stuff.,"Now, if you own everysingle KMFDM album, this obviously isn't for you- you can make your own for 2 bucks with a CD burner. If, on the other hand, you only own a few things or mainly got into KMFDM around '98 or so, then this compilation is very good and very helpful. Since I have a couple of the CD's this samples from, I fall in the middle and I still feel it's worth the money. I had never heard Godlike-Doglike before, or More&Faster, and even Vogue, all of which are great songs (though More&Faster may have limited appeal nowadays). This album is a marvellous intro to KMFDM, and it is also a nice way to round out a few holes until you can scrape the money together for several earlier CD's."
5,Very good,"I have seen these go from $15 to $30 and all look alike. Likely same OEM. This is the cheapest and works very well. It's heavy padded rubber, so it stays in place. Fits any stone I have. Worth the investment."
5,Steelex Stone Holder Well Made And A Big Help,"Sold rubber and steel raises the knife to be sharpened above knuckle-smacking heights and does a terrific job in holding the stone steady. No, it might not be the cat's meow for woodworkers, but for the millions of knife sharpeners it's a Godsend.Eventually I'll wind up with half a dozen of these baby's with a different grit stone in each holder."
1,Review,"Product arrived in good shape in spite of other items (a water stone) being broken which Amazon promptly replaced. However one of the knurled knobs wont travel more than an inch after which it jams up. Even with a pair of pliers it goes in only about another inch while it feels like actually threading the screw with a die. I stopped as I was afraid I would damage the product as it started to twist. Luckily my water stone is long, but I won't be able to use this holder on shorter stones -or broken stones.Returning the product (International shipping) would prove more expensive than the product itself. I wish they were properly checked before shipping as we (International customers) are already paying a premium price (because of added Intl shipping and our currency being inferior to the dollar).I'm disappointed, but the product still works for now."
5,Great Price,I searched and searched for a stone holder that wouldn't break the bank and found it here. The Steelex is well built and provides a solid foundation when I do my sharpening.
5,Water Stones are better.,"I have a few water stones for sharping my chisels and hand plane irons, I needed something to keep them from moving on my bench when sharping. This is perfect it's a big rubber brick!!!"
3,Good Enough,Bought this after using one I bought from Woodcraft. The one from Woodcraft is a little better.The item straight out of the box was tough to use. I had to use pliers/wrench to get the screws to budge whereas the one from woodcraft I could use my hands to adjust. It's a small nuisance and I'm sure after use the screws will be easier to adjust.If I had to buy again I would go back to the Woodcraft version for about the same price.
3,Not flat,"The only problem with the stone holder, or at least the one that was sent to me is that the pad in the middle is a little proud of the other two on the bottom, and shy off the stone surface on the top. I have been using it like this so far, but I want to try and flatten it with some sandpaper. One of the nuts also needed some lube to turn freely."
2,Knurled bolts failed to work,"The bolts that help to hold tightly the diferent honing stones cant turn back as supposed to do. One stops about halfway and the other stops after one inch of travel. I will try to fix it myself, as I live in Chile and can't return it.I knew, that I was going to fix it. In my ""sometime it will be useful"" drawer I found a 8"" piece of 3/8"" inner diameter aluminium tube. Two pieces of 2"" each between the rubber end piece and the bolts solved the problem that surged with the shorter stones. This way of coping with poor quality control may be useful to others that found the same problem."
2,Get what you pay for.,"Despite reading the some of the bad reviews here, I decided to purchase this anyways. The threads were crappy, as stated in the bad reviews, so I decided to try to fix it. First thing I did was try to screw down both ends to their stops. One went down easy; the other needed help to go down. It kept getting stuck at one point showing that the thread rods do suck and have bad threads due to cheap metal. I proceeded to force it all the way down and the threads fixed themselves, although not perfect. I am going to borrow a thread and dye set from work and repair the thread rod and the screws/knobs (whatever they are called) and see how it works. For the price it's not bad. I'll try to take pictures of the threads before and after, under my microscope, and post them here"
1,missing block of rubber on end,"stone holder wont hold anything because it came with only one lipped rubber block and the other two are flat . Therefore, the thing is useless cause it cant grip anything, let alone a stone. Dont they check the box before shipping? guess not.so the two adjustment wheels really dont adjust anything. useless."
5,A must for water stones,"This is a great purchase with a water stone. It allows you to do the sharpening over a bucket, which makes the process easier (the water just drips back in and you reuse) and also easier to clean up. I definitely recommend this product."
1,DVD is just OK,"This is a homemade video. There were even parts where the sound did not record. Even if it had been more professional, I would not have been happy because it referred constantly to castles and horses. I don't think that that is acceptable."
4,Good intro for kids,I liked the children in the DVD. My kids could relate to them. The special effects are nice. It's a good introduction to chess.
1,Hit me baby one more time!,"In 1998 Johnson's longstanding mistress, the writer Gloria Stewart, revealed their affair, including tape recordings: ""Paul loved to be spanked and it was a big part of our relationship. I had to tell him he was a very naughty boy,"" Stewart revealed.Naughty boy, naughty, naughty boy.At least, reportedly, his cut down on booze these days.So much for Marx's infidelity."
3,A man with a bouffant this bad should not be slinging mud,"...check out the author's picture on the back of the book. You'll see what I mean.An amusing set of ad hominem attacks on left leaning thinkers. The gossip is fun, but it would have been nice if he could have acknowledged a few more positive qualities, apart from the usual ""he was a good writer"" thrown bone. No one is perfect, but then again no-one is wholly bad, either (with the possible exception of Rousseau).Basically, if you are a conservative thinker or think you're pretty special, you'll love it. If you're a progressive thinker with more forgiving view of human nature, it'll get on your nerves after a short while.3 stars, because no-one ever seems to give reviewed items 3 stars, and it's fun to read at least some, if not all, of it. Summary: Kitty Kelly with a thesaurus."
2,A very funny book.,"This book is funny because Paul Johnson is called a 'historian' and the book is no better than a tabloid collection.The book gets 2 stars from me, one for showing the Christian historian scholarship, the other for revealing what kind of 'decent' person the author is.Can any conservative be a real intellectual?"
1,juicy gossip,"Ad hominem is a logical fallacy, you say? That sounds like something a sexually deviant, financially-incompetent intellectual would say."
1,"""I think we've all seen...Bonanza.""","Thanks Mrs. Farmer for the review title. And thank you Mr. Johnson for this gravel heaving display of school yard one-upsmanship. Seriously, could your dad beat up Rousseau's? I'll bet he could, huh?It's books like this that make me wish I could give less than one star."
2,"Entertaining, but poor science","I enjoyed his history of 1815 - 1830 very much, so I bought this without much thought, assuming it would show the genesis of certain ideas.It contains highly critical biographies of some people - Tolstoy, Hemmingway, Sartre, Brecht, and others, and says little about their ideas.Assuming that they were such bums as described, what point is proven?Where is a solid definition of what is meant by 'intellectual'? Where is a long list of those who fit and those who don't and why?How is it shown that the samples chosen for detailed study are randomly selected?And even if all this be true, once the unproven is discarded, all it says is that some people with very stong convictions tend to let those convictions blind them to truth and to common humanity. Rather tautological.Entertaining, but poor science."
2,repudiation of independent thought by a devout catholic,"Throughout all the reviews of this book,no one has mentioned the most salient motivating factor of Johnson;his devout catholic faith!He openly admits to finding the replacement of ecclesiastically dominated philosophies with 'rationalism' to be morally abhorrent.Thus we come to the nub of this and indeed all his works;man cannot replace god.That his attacks on bizarrely selected 'intellectuals' are vindictively selective ,unempirical,and ultimately ,of course the work of an intellectual(who himself has recently been shown to be an adulterer,despite fequently railing against infidelity)attempting to use rationalism, rather perversely both nullifies his work,and vindicates it.Thank god for the reformation of the church!"
3,Good book to have on your shelf,"400 pages of pure judgement. However it is a good book to have on your shelf, if you have an academical interest. This book is probably of most value in combination with other more positive books on the discussed intelectuals, since the object of Mr Johnson's book was apparently to show the dark side of these intelectuals."
3,One of the strangest books ever written,"One day Paul Johnson, a conservative christian intellectual, woke up and decided it would be a good idea if he picked out a few thinkers of what he took to be the opposing camp and wrote a long, windy book about their sexual peccadilloes -- and so he did. The result is something like a bastard child of Plutarch and Kenneth Anger, and tells us much more about Johnson than about his chosen victims. An interesting read, and the definitive account of the bankruptcy of reactionary thought."
1,"Haphazardly written, total disappointment","I think that Mr. Johnson has put too much of his own spin on what those intellectuals were like. Any person who would read a serious well-researched biography (say of Sartre by Annie Cohen-Solal) would know that Mr. Johnson is perhaps kidding around.If you don't spend the effort required to really know these intellectuals, don't expect too much. Embarrassment over cocktail conversations may result."
1,"More Rotten Right-wing Rubbish from ""Loonybins""","Paul Johnson...let us consider Paul Johnson. Long before the former editor of The Newstatesman had his Road to Damascus conversion, he must have realised that his true calling in life was to be a rather tiresome and bigoted polemicist, attempting to pass himself off as a historian. During his stagger from Left to Right, a ferocious resentment and jealousy of better minds than his seems to have sustained him. And hey ho, now he produces a squalid little polemic against the ""Left"" as his revenge. Satre was a pevert? Marx was given to drinking? Well darn, if a thinker is motivated by conservative or secular impulses, then that at once exempts them from the hatchet job. Intellectuals is the work of a bitter and mediocre man. Sure it is subtle, but it carries the same logic of hating the thinker, the humanist, she or he who scorns aboriginal predjudices and reaction. Johnson's charalatanism goes along the road that ends with books being tossed on bonfires."
4,One sided but true,"It is true that Johnson is quite selective and anecdotal in his description of the so-called Intellectuals, but it brings a previously ignored balance to these characters. We can see that the obviously did not believe what they preached, particularly Rousseau. We see these pontiffs of the Enlightenment as no more righteous then the old order. The only difference is that they claimed otherwise."
3,"it's an interesting, indeed","As the old Chinese saying goes, everyone would look down upon these people if they want to be literati. Indeed, people have prejudice against literati. Many people regard the Literati as the Literary Prostitute! Naturally, it is unfair! Intellectuals are human being too; to err is human. I can'nt understand why non-intellectual is allowed to err, is allowed to lie his wife, to be a jerk; but a writer, a scholar, a philosopher is not allowed? Is a sage really a deity? The more important is, a intellectuali is always in self-examination. Maybe TOLSTOY is a good example. He had undergone a long and even painful process of temper- ing in his life. That is a great characteristic for human being. The most important is, intellectuals offer us their works so that we, readers, can gain a good deal of enlightenment---from moral to appreciation of the beautiful. But, Paul Johnson's INTELLECTUALS is a good book. It broadens my outlook---Oh, I see, so it's human being!"
5,Amazing in its depth and relevance,"What Paul Johnson does, that many are afraid to do, is take a serious look at the lives of people who have shaped Western culture, and acknowledge their many short-comings. People from Hemmingway to Tolstoy are revealed to be quite human and undeserving of universal unqualified praise"
4,Competent Book,"I found this book well-written and well thought out. Though I might not agree with Mr. Johnson's choice of people to write about - the title is a bit misleading if people like Hemingway and Ibsen are included - still the analyses of the figures, from Rousseau through Marx to Sartre and the present, are better than pedestrian and offer a glimpse into the intellectual circles of the individuals and their eras. Do I recommend this book for the scholar? No. But for the educated lay person who has a bit of curiosity but doesn't want to be burdened with intellectualeze, this for me was a pleasurable and enlightening read."
3,Slightly spiteful,"I enjoyed this book, but by the same token I found it slightly spiteful. It points out that all the intellectuals covered in the book did not live according to their own tenets, or highlights other weaknesses in their make-up. But is this really important in appraising their works/ideas? Personally, I don't think it is all that important, and I therefore felt that the book was almost tabloid-ish in its approach. But despite this I think it is well written (in typical Johnson fashion) and worth reading."
2,Johnson is a snob,"As stated below a real waste of research.Anyone who reads this book,MUST read Chrisitopher Hitchens essay on Johnson in ""For The Sake of Argument&quot"
3,It works,"Cheap Red Chinese copy, but it works in a pinch. Buy one as a spare, but run a better quality module for daily use."
2,Generic???,this thing looks like junk.Hope i never have to depend on it.Bought for a spare in emergency.May be ok.
4,Ok if you're on the go,"Ok, let's face it: accesory companies have become very lax about the quality of their products. But this was one of those few items that actually works as well as you hope. the jumb stylii make like much easier and the gamecases allow you to carry all the games you want to take on a long car trip without making it impossible to remove the games from the cases when you want to switch it up. the screen protectors are bad, but everything else is great. A definite good buy!"
2,Not for DS lite,"I just realized after buying this that they have a separate one for DS Lite. I didn't realize that the car chargers were incompatible (and the sticks don't quite fit as nicely inside the DS lite). Otherwise, the kit seems adequate."
3,"Good remixes, but remixes.","I was hoping for a set of soundtracks; I got a set of soundtrack songs modified to put in more brass. Not bad music, but not what I was looking for."
5,Mom loves them,I bought these for my mother-in-law who recently had knee surgery and she finds them very comfortable.
4,Good DVD about the Air War in WWII,"The 3 DVD set is very well done. Good sequences, and the video of surviving WWII aircraft will be good for modelers. Very good documentary on the roles Radar played in the night bombing war over Germany.Recommended"
4,Just Right,"My wife is cold in the summer in Florida. She takes this jacket with her whenever she goes to the grocery store. It is light enough to carry anywhere yet warm enough for her. Shipping was super fast, and the colors were accurate."
5,Best intro Herbalism book yet,"When getting into herbalism, i wish i would have bought this book first! I started out buying complicated books for begginers that jumped streight into energetics and tissue states that frustrated me badly. Not to mention not 1 of the more challenging books actually told me how to make a tincture, or how much tea to use for medicinal purposes. Buy this book! Its imformative, fun, and a great way to see if Herbal medicine is a good hobby/way of life for yourself!"
4,Very basic Herbal,"This is a very good, but basic herbal. It is great for someone starting out, and if this isn't in depth enough for you, or after this book, i would certainly recommedThe Herbal Medicine Maker's Handbook: A Home ManualJames Green's The Herbal Medicine Maker's Handbook."
3,Physically hard to read,"The typeface is printed in a light purple. Perhaps it is my age, but I find this book very hard on my eyes to read."
3,Great for the budding herbalist,"I purchased this book hoping that it would guide me in the creation of herbal remedies -- I'd always had a culinary herb garden and wanted to expland my horizons. I wasn't disappointed -- there were many simple recipes for decoctions, poultices, and other non-culinary herb uses. However, some -- okay, many! -- of the descriptions and instructions were beyond what the simple practicioner or budding herbalist could understand. In the end, I just use the recipes I've marked and ignore the rest of the book."
5,Excellent beginner's guide to the world of herbal medicine,"This book is written in a humorous, easy to understand and concise format. It is an great way for someone who has never studied herbal medicine before to dip their toes in the water. Ms. Wardwell is very clear about the dangers of using certain herbs. It also has wonderful guidelines on learning how to identify the different types of plants and herbs you'll be using. Ms. Wardwell also includes several recipes for various tinctures, teas, wines and vinegars to be used. She also offers interesting stories explaining the folklore behind certain plants as well. I can't recommend this book highly enough to any student of herbalism whether beginner or advanced."
5,The Art of Simpling...,"Simpling refers to a method of learning herbalism. Choose an herb and explore every facet of it - leaves, petals roots, uses, dangers - inside and out. When you finally ""know"" that, then and only then, choose a second herb to get to know. This book is an amazing primer for beginners to herbalism. I chafed its simplicity at first, ""More herbs! Its too basic!"", until I really began to learn my first herb, catnip. Then I realized how silly I'd been and how very much there was to learn. This book is a bible for beginners!"
5,Great instruction video for the basics,"I bought this for my grandson who is starting drums. I am teaching him, but don't live close enough to see him more than once or twice a week.This video did a great job of demonstrating the drum rudiments. Also the web site is excellent.A great vid to have for starting out, or for those that want to review/learn the rudiments."
4,good cookbook,"i've used quite a few recipes from the book and while a lot of them turned out really great, there have been a few that have turned out pretty bad (like the butter tarts - runny and tasted like corn syrup). some of the recipes in there though are SO good (like the black bean soup, old fashioned chicken pot pie, slow and easy real barbecued ribs, etc)."
1,Never knew Canadians made Tiramisu...LOL,"Don't waste your money. If you want to make Thai food, Sushi, or Fetuccini Alfredo then buy a Betty Crocker book. Doesn't have Canadian recipes like I was looking for."
3,I like the first one better!,I got this at Target. I love Bethenny so of course I had to buy it as soon as I saw it. It was okay to me. But I like her first video better. I like the instructor in her first workout better too. I had the desire to do her first video multiple times(and still do). I do not have that desire with this one. Not sure why just not my preference or what I expected.
1,This Yoga Workout Does Not Work Out Well For Me!,"It was not the case of the chatter between Bethenny and her instructor or perhaps it was, it was that there is no mix and match feature here. In other words, when I chose to do just workout 1, it jumped right to workout 2 and the rest of the DVD. Plus, this DVD should be considered advanced since most of the poses are sort of confusing and difficult for someone like me who is not all that flexible at all. Other than that, I hope Mike McArdle will be out with more yoga DVDs in the near future. He was not bad at all as instructor. But Bethenny's chatter often interrupted with his teachings which caused some confusion as too what the moves I was supposed to be doing."
5,Great workout!,"I have never really done yoga before, but wanted to get into it. I will admit that I am a huge fan of Bethenny. I think she's wonderful and I love her sense of humor so when I saw this at a big-box store I knew I had to own it. I figured if anyone could make yoga accessible it would be Bethenny and I was right. She doesn't always do every pose perfectly and doesn't always do the ""advanced"" option, which I find refreshing. To me there is nothing worse than a workout DVD that the person is so stiff and does everything perfectly....kinda makes me feel like a failure. The dynamic between Bethenny and Mike McArdie is great - very relaxed and enjoyable.I really like the 3 workouts that you can pick and choose from and the 12 minute stretch is awesome. It is NOT an easy workout - just challenging enough to push you, but not so impossible that you want to give up. I'm looking forward to using this for a long time in the future."
3,Just ok,"It's just Bethenny being Bethenny, If you love her like I do you'll like it. She's kinda funny,and I think even gets on the instuctors nerves alittle bit."
3,meh,"i love bethenny and this was just ok. her trainer should really get the credit for this. ""bethenny"" did not shine through, i did not feel like i was doing yoga with her (to keep it light and funny) which to me, was the whole point."
2,Not a beginner DVD - annoying comments,"I just received this DVD and watched the first 10 minutes today - that's all I could take. It was really too difficult for beginners, requiring aerobic and strength moves (push-ups and thrusters) and balance that is difficult if you're overweight or overage (older than 25, that is!). I'm 58 and about 30 lbs. over weight, if that helps you decide if this is for you.Plus, there is no instruction, just straight into the moves, which are difficult to see on the TV when you're bent into a pretzel, looking at your toes. I think I'd rather take a class to have a live instructor correct my moves.P.S. Oh, did I say that Bethenny makes quirky little comments throughout? That will also get annoying after the 3rd time of watching!"
2,Not for the newbie,"I REALLY wanted to like this. I love Bethany's style. She's laid back and has a great sense of humor. Unfortunately, for me, this DVD was too difficult. I've never done yoga before and this DVD professed to be for people of all levels. I found it difficult to do most of the positions properly because I had to keep looking at the tv so I knew what I was doing. Also, many of the moves were quite difficult for an inexperienced person. There wasn't enough explanation or time given to perform each new move before moving on to the next. Also, I can easily see how someone could seriously hurt themselves if the moves aren't done properly. It does give a fantastic stretch..but aren't you only suppose to stretch warm muscles? Anyway, if you've done yoga before, this would be quite enjoyable I'm sure. However, if you've never done it, I would suggest taking a class for some hands on training."
5,BEST WORKOUT!,I'm NOT Bethenny's biggest fan but I LOVED this workout video. It is easy but pushes you to work hard. Fun and simple.
3,Sc-fi *thriller* at its best,Very good story. Fast paced and very entertaining.Doesn't need to be a sequel. Has all the references for reader to understand the context.
4,The Ghost Brigades,"An excellent follow-on to Old Man's War, although one wouldn't need to read the first book to enjoy this one. I enjoyed Ghost Brigades immensely and am currently waiting for The Last Colony to arrive in the post. John Scalzi is an exceelnt author in my view and I can't wait for future works."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Someone with rather a large amount of knowledge of the science and politics of the Colonial Union has decided to do a runner.However, there is an old template of him on file, so to speak, so they make a new body to perhaps use against him. The intelligence officer that gets to babysit? Jane Sagan.Apparently Special Forces types get named after scientists etc., so this new guy is named Dirac.Naturally he runs into the old guy, and along the way some twists and turns in the galactic political situation are revealed, setting up the scenario for the third book in this series."
4,Needs More Editing,I liked the book quite a lot but there were an unusually large number of typos. That and I thought the ending was a bit formulaic. But it was a very good read and I'm looking forward to The Last Colony.
5,Ghost Brigade,"A great follow-up to Old Man's War and an expansion of the Special Forces concept introduced there. Excellent story line that is developed well, and combat scenes are top notch. Highly recommended."
5,Great book,"Scalzi reads much like Heinlein, but with more action and less preachiness. I stumbled upon the first in this series (Old Man's War) and Ghost Brigades stands up to it."
5,Excellent,"Another imaginitive novel by Scalzi in which very real characters encounter extraordinary circumstances. I like Scalzi's work because his characters don't do the same stupid things to get into trouble that we've read a thousand times before (like trying to escape an attacking automobile by running straight down the center of the road, just jump in the bushes, you idiot!) They get into trouble because the universe,Scalzi, won't let them live in peace. There are just too many aliens and not enough planets to go around."
4,Clever premise,The trilogy as a whole has a clever premise for it's backdrop. Ghost Brigades continues to expand a cleverly created universe. This rises above some of the 'brain candy' within the science fiction universe and offers an enticing alternative to reality.
3,It's worth a read but only remotely connected to the other books,"I loved Old Man's War (book 1) and am about halfway through The Last Colony (book 2). In comparison this book just doesn't have the same feel or ""heart"". That being said it does advance the story line forward slightly and helps put book 3 in the proper context. It get's a little preachy but not terribly so.So, if you're a fan of the Old Man's War universe then I'd say go for it. You'll probably enjoy it, just don't expect the same level of enjoyment as the 1st book. The last colony is pretty darn good, so it's worth reading."
4,Comments on The Ghost Brigades,"This, I found better than The Last Colony. Skim over the parts that do not add to the plot. The premise is good, but the execution of the dialogue is sometimes too drawn out."
3,"Entertaining, sometimes intriguing, a good read","I thought this was a worthy sequel to Old Man's War, and it hooked me enough to keep me eagerly turning the pages. But it didn't actually have too much to do with the Ghost Brigades per se, so look elsewhere if you want lots of space opera shoot-em-up and military tactics. It was good to get a better look at human-alien politics, though. It seemed to me less an adolescent fantasy on the wonders of having a superman body (which is how Old Man's War felt to me at times) and more a post-adolescent fantasy about the possibilities of the BrainPal. And I'm happy Scalzi apparently realized the branding on ""BrainPal"" is painful."
3,The Ghost Brigades,"I so enjoyed ""Old Man's War"" that I couldn't wait to get the second installment. Although it was good, it wasn't nearly as good as the first one.I definitely recommend it as I loved the first book and have almost finished the third which I am loving, too.Get it!"
4,It Has Been a Long Time,"It has been a long time since I have read two sci fi books by the same author in quick succession. The fun of Scalzi's ""Old Man's War"" prompted the quick purchase of and immediate reading of ""The Ghost Brigades"". And, again, Scalzi delivers a very enjoyable read.With ""The Ghost Brigades"" the characters get a bit more character. Since so much of the book turns on Jared Dirac's character this is a good and necessary accomplishment by Scalzi.Is the obvious only obvious to the reader? Colonial Defense ships are going missing at an extraordinary rate. The traitor is known and was working for Colonial Defense in brain software research. 1+1=2? Is there a link between the software and the disappearances? Fortunately, the plot does not turn on these lapses.Finally, are there really people out there who do not like the black jellybeans? I never thought of this as a cultural identifier, perhaps because I am a great fan of the black beans."
2,Big letdown...,"......After Old Man's War. Gone is the humour, the perhaps naive sense of wonder. Ghost brigades does its worst with its more than human protagonists, wading through one info dump after the other to climax with the bad guy explaining is cunning plan so that the hero can thwart it. As much as OMW reminded me how I liked Space Opera as a kid, TGB confirmed that there is more interesting SF to read out there."
3,Fast-paced,"This book falls short of a four- or five-star rating because it sacrifices important detail in exchange for a quick pace. For example, there are several alien races that play an important role in the story (the Obin, Rraey, Consu, and more)that are scarcely described at all. The only thing that separates them are their names and concerns. I would have liked to have read more detail about the different races -- their appearance, habits, etc.The science featured in the book is thoughtfully explained and compelling. The main characters were interesting, but some of the lesser characters are poorly developed. There is little difference between them beyond their names.This is the second novel in a series, and I enjoyed it enough to want to check out the first novel as the universe the author has created is an interesting one... even if this novel left me wanting more vivid description of the characters and the story's setting."
4,"Cool, but without the first one's impact","I liked this book a lot. I finished after reading The Old Man's War and The Last Colony. It was good, same universe, many likeable characters, although some cliches killed the mood for me. But dont think that this book will let you down. If you enjoyes the first ones this will be just as good, perhaps a tiny bit less because it wont have that feeling of amazement or awe you had when you had had read the first one.Anyway, its good. And keeps me wanting more book on this series."
4,Ghost Brigades,"Like all of Scalzi's work. This fills in info for other books he's done. Like characters, believable plots and continuous action. Hope he does more of this series."
4,Scalzi gains momentum,"This book is military sci-fi at its best, where it deals with more than hardware and the effects of beam weapons in a vacuum. Scalzi's first novel and the precursor to this, ""Old Man's War,"" was an engaging, imaginative book that suffered from an excess of Heinlein in the narrative style. I was really pleased to see that Scalzi found his own voice in this one. All in all, this is a better book, well plotted and, overall, well paced (although right at the end I felt the momentum got bogged down; also, I found the ending a little contrived). This isn't hard sci-fi like David Brin or Iain Banks, and there's still a lot of ""Starship Troopers"" in the mix, but I liked this book and I like John Scalzi. I think he's an author to watch. (Read the acknowledgments if you want some insight into his personality --- not at all the blue-collar Joe his About the Author photo suggests!) I'll be keeping an eye out for what he does next."
4,Excellent and a fast paced page turner,Science fiction at its best for an intriguing commentary on war and Big Brother government. An outstanding trilogy. Highly recommended.
4,Old man's war,An excellent take on an old concept. It flowed fast and smoothly. A few ideas that have been recycled a LOT with science fiction but for the most part an original and fun story.
5,Great Series,"I finished both Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades in just under a week (downloaded them to the Kindle app on my phone so I could read them at work). Thought they would make great movies. Not just a shoot 'em up but has real context and texture regarding getting old, being young, being human in a much bigger universe."
2,Very disappointing,"This book is sequel through and through. With none of the flow and logic of Old Man's War, this book limps along. Like a long boring drive, at least the ending is nice. The book felt strongly like it was quickly written with little editing or rewriting.Skip drive."
5,Loved it,I just finished this book minutes ago. And I loved it. It was just as good if not a little better then old mans war. I can't wait for the last colony to come out.
4,"Great ""light"" read and engaging story","The Ghost Brigades is not the heaviest sci-fi read, and it is not mired in overy developed technology concepts. Its just a great read that goes quickly. I enjoyed the entry point of the book that presented a surprising perspective change right through the somewhat ""tidy"" conclusion. There are some sophomoric elements to the storyline, some convenient devices, but on the whole very engaging and readable. I have placed the book on my well protected ""recommend to friends"" list if that says anything at all."
3,TOOO SLOW,"Very slow read- it took almost 1/4 of the book to develop the main character and the next 150 pages had minimal action.The first book ""Old Man's War"" kept your interest much more fully than this sequel.I am not at all certain that I will purchase any more of his books at this point."
4,Not Another Bug Hunt,"I was expecting a sequel and I was pleasantly disappointed. While the story does take place in the same universe, it's a whole new story unto itself in reference to Old Man's War. I kept waiting for John Perry to come into the story but I'm quiet happy with the story only eluding to him now and then through Jane.I loved the way his story twists into something so much more than just another ""Bug Hunt"" science fiction book. I didn't know who I wanted to win in the end and I loved it. I won't give anything away so I'll leave it at that. If you've read Old Man's War, and I do recommend you do before reading this one, then you'll just tear into this one and love every page."
4,Great fun with some kernels for thought,"This book, and it's series, will be compared to Starship Troopers and The Forever War. I think that's unfortunate because this isn't a ""big ideas"" story. It isn't fluff, and has some Important concepts, but that isn't it's focus.Want a great Story? Read this series.Want your mind blown? Read The God Engines."
4,"Good sequel to ""Old Man's War""","This sequel to ""Old Man's War"" does an excellent job of filling out the background to one of the more mysterious figures in the first novel. The Ghost Brigades - the ""special forces"" of the CDF - are by their nature shadowy and unknown. This inside look provides the same kind of voyeuristic thrill for a work of fiction that the ""Inside SEAL Team Six"" books do in real life.The change of perspective - from common grunt to special forces; from male to female; from old and revitalized to the youthful ""reborn"" - keeps this 2nd book fresh while also moving the story toward (and providing a key element of) its finale inThe Last Colony."
5,Even Better Than Old Man's War,"""Old Man's War"" was a hard act to follow. Scalzi's first novel was a fabulous sci-fi debut in the best tradition of the great Heinlein. Strikingly, his follow-up novel ""The Ghost Brigades"" is another great work, which boasts a deeper plot that makes masterful use of his earlier effort. This new novel explores the mysterious Special Forces of the Colonial Defense Forces universe, telling the unlikely story of a hero manufactured from the villain (!). Scalzi weaves another smart and fast-moving plot, as full of surprises as ""Old Man's War"". Highly recommended."
4,Hope to see more...,"My wife and I loved Old Man's War and Ghost Brigades - we're looking forward to seeing more books set in this universe. Great characters, great action, great science fiction... and without the pompous philosophizing or heavy moralism that seems to plague so many otherwise good science fiction works."
3,Let Down,"Perhaps, it is unfair, but after reading OLD MAN'S WAR, I expected more of the same. THE GHOST BRIGADES seemed stale in comparison.The story takes place from the perspectve of a Special Forces soldier. These people are more enhanced than the normal grunt. The Colonial Defense Force is interested in tracking down a traitor, so they implant his consciousness into the SF soldier and wait for memory to kick in.I don't have a problem with the science, but there seems to be zero effort to develop characters or come up with anyone you really care about.I suspect there is a third book on the way. I guess I'm undecided as to whether it is worth the effort."
3,It is ok but..,The story is fine but for some reason it is not surprising enough. I got the feeling I did read something like it before.
2,Are these reviewers all insane???,"Please read a few books by the following authors:Iain M. Banks, Charles Stross, William Gibson, John C. Wright, Richard Morgan, Neal Asher, Ken MacLeod.Or just read one book by one of the above authors. Now read Ghost Brigade.Notice a difference?Scalzi has to tell rather than show. His characterization is shallow. His technological ideas would have been novel ten years ago. The pacing drags.Here's an example: At one point he writes that the soldier's guns are linked to their specific brain implants. He then writes that that's so ""their guns can't be used against them by anyone else"". Really?!! Thanks for making that clear, because I wouldn't have picked up on it otherwise. The writing follows this painful pattern throughout.This would be a great book for a seventh or eigth grader wanting to read their ""first"" sci fi novel, but is it really ""top notch""? If you want some great sci fi, skip this and read any of the authors listed above."
5,excellent,Scalzi spreads his focus amongst more characters in this great sequel.It's a bit grimmer than OMW but manages to keep the high standard he displayed in 'Old Man's War'.Looking forward to the next in the series.
4,Second is never as amazing...,"as the first, but this is a solid above-par adventure. What makes you you, and the values you possess, are the main concerns here. Also killing aliens. But, gasp, are we the good guys? Grab #2 and eagerly await #3."
4,Recommended,"As expected, Ghost Brigades didn't disappoint. Mr. Scalzi continues to show us why he has been, and continues to be, a succesful SF author. Old Man's War, this novel's successor, gets a 5 star review from me. This is a worthy successor. Now, on to The Last Colony."
3,Ghost Brigades is a good read,Not as good as Old Man's War but better than most new writters. I like his freshness and new ideas. He could be as good as Bradbury someday.
5,A great read and great fun,This is my second time reading this and I enjoyed it as much as the first. Scali has built a great universe. As a sequel I believe it was better than Old Mans War. I wish he would hurry up with the serial he is publishing now!
5,Excellent!,"I have to admit that when I first picked up this book and looked in the inside jacket cover I didn't think I was going to enjoy it. But I loved Old Man's War so what the hell. Boy, was I wrong! This book is a very very worthy follow-up to Old Man's War. Simply superb. I have a very short list of authors whose books I will buy as fast as they can get them published - Mr. Scalzi is now one of them."
4,"A good read, with or without Old Man's War","I really enjoyed this book. It's quick and funny. If you like his other stuff, you'll like this one. I don't think it's necessary to have read Old Man's War to enjoy this one, but it probably helps.Scalzi's work is very accessible Sci-Fi. Yes, there are aliens and space ships and futuristic things. But it doesn't depend on them. If you don't understand the physics (Real or imagined) of space travel, you don't have to in order to enjoy this book."
2,Disappointing 2nd book,"It was disappointing to read this after the excellent Old Man's War.Character development is sketchy.Plot is slow to develop, and lacks the highlights and reveals of his first book.Much potential here which the right editor can develop."
4,Great doll,"This doll is *very* pretty. She has wonderful clothes and acessories, and gorgeous, big, blue eyes. She comes with alot of stuff,like:Boots,acessories,regular shoes,boxes bags. And so much more!Just watch out for her ~hair~. It is very,very soft,but it is curly,so it will be frizzy if you brush it alot."
5,Favorite Madison doll :),"I've loved this Madison doll ever since I got her. :DShe's good for any season. In summer, she has sandles (though I lost them :() and short sleeves, in winter, she has a coat and purple boats. :)"
4,OK...,"This My Scene doll is a very nicely-made doll, but she doesn't send the best message...As you may have noticed, Madison is shopping...which is all My Scene dolls ever do.Do you really want to send us girls that shopping is the best thing you can do with your time?Think about it..."
2,ok..........................................................,"all the girls do is shop, shop, shop. is there anything else they can do??????????????? very bad. :("
1,awful toy,"ummm, do these girls actually DO anything? they don't go to school and they don't work. that isn't a good example for little girls. what happened to the career girl barbies from back when i was young in the 90's. they taught me that i could be anything i wanted to. like a gymnast or a rock star. these just teach you about shopping and boys. mattel, you haven't scored on these dolls at all."
3,The japanese feeling?,"The band Mono is often compared to Explosions In The Sky. I can see the reason for that, because both bands use clean guitar layers to slowly build songs until they burst into heavy/groovy parts. But the music of Mono is a lot more simple than that of EITS. They repeat the same melodies often and take more time building the songs up, even tough they don't add many elements while the song is growing. The songs have a very good flow and are quite melancholic. There is often a clean string instrument present in the background (which name I don't know) which reminds me of japanese music because of its slow and sad melodies. This band also has a more present bass guitar than EITS, but the drumming is also more simple.Mono sounds like a post rock band playing adagios. The music is appealing but I think its simplicity will put limits to its longevity and replay vallue."
1,Maybe the LP version is better,"Another sonic mess. Clipping, distortion, zero dynamics, wimpy invisible drums...Another wasted purchase because of the loudness war. This cd is a sonic mess, whether it was in the mixing or the mastering, I don't know but they sure ruined some good music. Avoid if you care about sound quality.look up 'loudness war' at wikipedia or google 'loudness war lousy sound' for more info."
3,post something,"from the online samples available here, it is post something, but it has nothing to do with rock. damn the pigeon holes."
3,I am here,"3 1/2Consisting of the usual few epics alongside more mellow introspections, YAT represents the band in the final thresholds of songwriting integrity before seemingly running out of juice."
3,"It was ok, but there are better","I felt that ""Simply Golf Back To Basics"" was a better purchase. The ""Fun To Know"" follows along as a real novice is learning how to play golf. There is no real terminology and no stretching exercise give as in the other video. If you just want a overview of the body positions and you buy the used one for the cheapest price, I will say it is a ok purchase. As the title states it is basic techniques and not much else. A few etiquette questions are answered, but nothing you could not ask someone for free. It does however advocate real golf lessons and does not try to pretend to be all you will need to be successful."
4,Intriguing,"From the introduction of the characters through the inevitable collision of their lives, Rickstad keeps the dialogue fresh and the action paced well. I was especially impressed with the exacting way he used description of the smallest detail to manipulate my imagination to evoke empathy in people/situations I would shun in real life. An example is the way he described the sound and smell of a car's heater so I felt like I was in that car and yes, I could remember having heard that sound and smelled that smell."
5,I'd suggest this novel,"I was really impressed with this novel. It was sad at times, but very well rendered. Heartlfelt. I had sympathy for the characters, even those who behaved poorly. It was a real nice read and I enjoyed it."
4,Very good and very down-to-earth!!!!,"""Reap"" was a very interesting book. Jessup seemed to fall into the wrong hands with Reg and Marigold, thus learning a life lesson the hard way. Marigold was one tough cookie and her husband was a total waste. If he didn't want to work then he shouldn't be terrorizing other people who do. I admire Marigold's strength and perserverance. She did the right thing at the end of the book. Jessup needed to open his eyes and see just how bad his connection with Reg really was. The fair scene hit too close to home. This book left me with a feeling of incompleteness."
2,Overwritten and Far too Dense,"I agree with the TIMES and KIRKUS. The characters apparently have no inner lives, and their thoughts are cliched and trite. The author does reference long-lost fathers in an attempt to provide some complexity to the characters, but unfortunately, this fails to give them true and honest depth--depth that would give the book's action much-needed resonance. The dense descriptions and long-winded prose dilutes the dramatic tension. Several minor characters could've been cut (especially since the author felt compelled to change pov for almost every scene) which would've enabled the author to create more fully realized major characters and ultimately provide a stronger foundation for the overly plotted action. I truly looked forward to reading this book, but came away disappointed. REAP is uneven and doesn't showcase the writer's talents. Although his descriptions are lovely at points, they don't make up for a severe lack of characterization."
2,Good memory but not worth but one third of its price...!,"This like any other brands memory is functional, but for the price this is offered for, it isnt worth it one bit, so beware, there is just-as-good and cheaper out there...Viking is way too much money...!"
2,This is a children's book.,"I bought this book based on the rave reviews it had received. I was very disappointed. I was looking for a book which would describe where the various bodies were found, the objects they were found with and what we could discern from the bones, locations and objects. I wanted to hear the stories of these tragic Romans. This had very little of that. It is also a children's book, which no one mentioned in previous reviews. I think this would be a good book for older children on this subject, however I would not recommend it for adults."
3,Bodies from the Ash,"This book is quite small but does have nice photos. It is a ""coffee table"" book in my opinion. I had hoped it would have been more ""scientific"" than is it turned out to be. No in-depth discussion on the bodies, their clothing, etc. I wanted to know more about the lives of the people that had lived in this ancient city."
4,For digital video beginners who want to stick with it...,"This is an extremely well produced book, and I am surprised it costs only $25 to $30. I am a rank beginner, and I found it somewhat technical--and it seemed to be aimed at young videographers who want to do commercial work more than householders who will edit their trip to Six Flags. I found the abbreviations and terms somewhat daunting (CCD, chrominance, luminance, NTSC, PAL, SECAM, etc.) and the technical descriptions also somewhat daunting (ex: how the camera codes Red Green and Blue colors). Later in the book, the author describes cameras, production and post-production in some detail. These were all worthwhile subjects.By the end of the book, however, I was sure that I did not want to invest in a digital movie camera set. For that reason, it was worth the $25."
3,Kindle buyers beware!,"I am only about 10% of the way through this book (according to my Kindle meter), and have already found seventy (70) typos. It looks like whatever program they used to turn the book into an e-book randomly cut words in half (about 3 per Kindle page, sometimes more, sometimes less).I haven't read enough to give a full review of the content, but so far the author has impressed me with details and history of the region. I will come back and edit this review when I finish the book."
5,A very good story.,"it's detailed, but shows what happens in a large scale tank battle. This one's worth the money. Mine is a kindle version."
3,Samsung needs to inspect their products before release,"this product has the best picture I seen,BUT!!!! the audio has dropouts every 20 seconds,through the HDMI,or digital outs,in other words,is buggy,being refurbished (,and I purchased it here,through Amazon,)i Cannot send it back,so I have to go through Samsung to have it fixed,hope they have the fix,this piece has potential for a good seller"
2,Don't waste your money on this item,"This model received high ratings when we looked around at several sites in early 2005 so we decided to buy it. What a mistake. It's a pain to copy vhs to dvd with menus. Very confusing. First problem was the unit freezing during recording.This should have given us a hint. Next, DVDs would stop playing mid-movie - they would get stuck and we would have to forward several frames to be able to continue the movie. Now, it doesn't even recognize DVDs anymore. We just dumped it today. Not even going to bother paying to get it fixed - we bought a new non-Samsung model."
2,Good deal?,"After trouble with several DVD players, I decided to invest in this higher cost unit. The option to record from VHS tapes held a big appeal. The unit worked very well for 10 months. Then, the DVD would not open. I don't know why DVD units tend to do that, but I have had a couple that did the same thing. With the cost of this unit, I had hoped to avoid problems. So much for getting what you pay for. Does anyone know why DVD's stop opening or how to fix the problem? Thank you."
1,Big problems - don't buy this,"THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK !!! Many of my DVD's when played in this unit stick, skip, video signal breaks up into illegible squares, audio signal drops out. These DVD discs play without a problem in my other machines. I called Samsung tech support, who told me to update firmware, which I did. Problems remained the same. Then I sent it in to their repair center (they charged me $30 for this). It came back in 2 weeks UNREPAIRED -- same problems. Then when I called and asked for my money back they refused and said I need to send it to another repair center. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN !!!Ken Meyer"
2,Junk,"First it stopped recording DVDs, then it stopped recognizing DVDs it had recorded. Now it doesn't recognize any DVDs. I've had it for about 10 months."
2,NOT very scary Paranormal Proof,"If you want to rent or buy this movie because you like the Paranormal activity movies,DON""T!Lame actors, NOT scary, and no suspense.The only thing this movie is PROOF of, is that it is bad.save your money, eventually it will make t's way to TV or the free bin.Wait and watch it then, don't waste good money on it."
1,Don't waste your time,"This supposed documentary of lost film footage proving paranormal activity is a joke. It doesn't work as a documentary - because it's not. It doesn't work as a scary movie - because it's not. Don't get sucked in by the cover. It's boring. I consists mostly of stilted dialogue and monologue, a lot of it while looking into the camera, opining on the existance of a dead woman's ghost and the creepy things that are happening. Creepy being noises, open kitchen cabinets, and, yes, dead mom appears. The cover scene is brief as younger daughter freaks out. The rest of the movie is either boring dialogue and monologue, or extended darkish scenes of the attempt to capture images and sounds of the ghost. Not even worth one star."
5,A Technicolor Goodnight Moon,"My little girl loved this book as much as BABOON, but this time Hallensleben knocked our socks off with the colors! If you ever come out with posters and t-shirts of this book's art, sign us up!"
2,Maybe too well written for toddlers,"I bought this book for my 2 1/2-year-old twins, but a lot of it goes over their heads. Obviously the author has talent, but she's more of a poet than a storyteller. Perhaps she should be targeting an older crowd. This book has elements suited for toddlers (big pictures, only one sentence per page) but the writing is too sophisiticated and abstract for them, and the story too disjointed. I guess it would be good for a one-year-old or younger who just enjoys hearing a parent read a peaceful book (e.g., ""Eyes close. There is a drowsy hush. Darkness swells into a colorful dream. And if the moon could talk...""). But my kids prefer books with stories they can understand, and even repeat. This ain't that."
5,Our Family's Current Favorite!,"I love this book! The pictures are amazing--the text, more like poetry than prose. To me, it is so beautiful that it actually makes me a little weepy.Best of all, my 19-month old son brings it to us again and again (saying ""moon, moon""). It's one of the few ""bigger-kid"" books he will actually sit through!To me, it is nothing like Goodnight Moon (which we also love)--it is a whole different category!"
2,This movie treats its audience like idiots!,"It was loosely based on one of Chinese famous fiction. I bought it because Tony Leung was one of the star. What a waste of money! The fighting scene is so so. One of the big weakness that trashes this movies is its UNREASONABLENESS. For example at the end, one of the hand of the monk was chopped off. He had to fight with only one hand. After the villian was killed, the monk walked away like a healthy person. He was seen with 2 HANDS, NO BLOOD on his bokdy and joking with his friend! What was the director thinking? Are all his audience kids?"
2,Doesn't fit right and hurts my back,I am a big girl and my husband is a small guy. I was the first one to try to use this and no matter how I tried it was never comfortable. The baby was held too high. He was right under my chin so I had to look around him to try to do anything. I couldn't bend over in fear of him falling out. After wearing my son for awhile my back started hurting. My husband tried it out and had the same problems. I decided to try a wrap. I found something called Moby Wrap. It is so much more comfortable and provides more positions for baby. When my son is old enough I may try to use this again as a back carrier. I think it may work better this way. It is definately not good for front carrying.
3,Good for a short time,My son really likes being held in the Snuggli and it does fit well on both me and my husband. The reason I only gave it three stars is because at about 15 pounds it became _very_ tight on him (it's suppose to work up to 26 lbs.). Why didn't the manufacturer make it adjustable to grow with the baby? I guess that's why it's only $20.00!
2,Not for a baby with reflux,"Our little one had reflux and anytime we put him in the carrier it was a royal mess. There was just enough pressure on his little belly to turn it into a projectile mess. I always felt like his little head was pressed to hard up against Mommy, or if folded down, it jabbed him in the chin. Great theory, but my little man just wasn't comfortable."
1,Not a fan!!,I've used this carrier twice & didn't like it either time. I felt like my son was being suffocated & the support was very lousy. I guess you get what you pay for... cheap price & cheap quality!!
2,Still struggling,"A nice, tightly designed little carrier, but not simple. I'm still not able to get the baby into it and then lift him while adjusting the straps and etc. If you're very coordinated or you have someone else in the house all the time to help you, this is fine. Otherwise, look further!"
4,great for the price,"my son never wanted to be in his stroller. so i purchased this when he was 2 months old... he loved it . i used until he was 6 months old , by then he was just too heavy and would kill my back. so i purchaed the hip hammock . also great product"
5,Great carrier!,"I don't know why all the bad reviews? This is VERY simple to put baby in and out. All you have to do is hold baby against your chest with one hand and latch both slide locks, then buckle near the head. I've used this through 2 babies (same carrier) and loved it. I've carried both children for hours through Disney World, sports games, etc with no problems and no back pain. The more expensive ones are not worth it. I've used them and this works just as great. Plus it has several different pockets to keep your phone, pacifiers, or anything you want. Both of my babies would fall asleep within 5 minutes of walking in it every time!"
3,Didn't get much use,I bought this instead of a cumbersome double stroller when I had my 5th child. I had a 2 yr old to keep after so I put her in the stroller and the baby in the Snugli. This works well if you are going to use it for a long period of time. My back was hurting me when I got to the end of the mall (which isn't very big btw). When I took the baby out of it he had the impressions from the Snugli on his little thighs. Also tight for baby if you are well endowed up top.
3,Easy to Use,"This carrier is very easy to use. My son loves to be in it while I'm trying to do housework. It's definately a strain on your back if you have a big baby...I imagine I'll only be able to use if for a total of 5 months. I've also found that if you or your mate are large, it is awfully snug. It's not a must have, but nice to get as a gift."
2,I hope there are better carriers out there...,"I received the Snugli as a gift... PROS: my son loves it, the warmth the closeness... Falls asleep almost instantly as soon as I put him in and start walking around. CONS: He is a newborn (13 days old today), 2 oz shy of 7 lb and the carrier doesn't give him nearly enough neck/head support. I always hold his head when he's in it because it flops around if I don't. NO support for my back at all. HATE that."
2,OUCH!,"I can't wear this item for more than 30 min. at a time b/c it hurts my back so bad! I've never had back problems, so that's not the issue. It just doesn't have any back support. Save the $20!"
4,a great carrier,We have this carrier as well as a Bjorn. I love them both. I have this carrier set up for me to use and the Bjorn is set up for my hubby (it's more comfortable for him and the Evenflo)...it's nice for both of us to have one then we don't have to readjust the straps depending on who is carrying our son.
5,Just as good as the really expensive ones...,One of the main reasons that I chose this carrier was because it didn't have a strap around the waist like so many others do. I'm short and the carriers w/ the waist straps don't fit me properly. This one fits perfect and my son loves it. He's 2 months old now and we've been using it since he was a newborn. I don't know how I'd get any shopping done without it!! Well worth the $20!!
2,"okay, you get what you pay for","I received this as a gift. I was registered for the baby bjorn. Since it was a gift I decided to keep it. I used it once. It was horrible. it was hot outside, but my 6 week old daughter was sweating in it. It says it's breathable, but in 80 degree weather it was too hot. Also it made my back sore. Okay for quick trips, but if going out for several hours I suggest investing some money in an adjustable baby sling or pouch like Maya Wrap. There's several brands out there."
3,Average,"Overall, this carrier decent but needs improvement. It is easy to use and clean. The downside is: when my daughter is front-facing, the flap that must be folded down usually unfolds and covers her face. Also the arms and legs are a bit tight and the storage pocket can't hold much other than a house key or ID."
2,Uncomfortable,I used this carrier for about 2 weeks and it was soooo uncomfortable. I sold it on ebay. I instead decided to spend the money for a Baby Bjorn and Im so glad I did. I love the Baby Bjorn.
4,good product,I got the snugli front and back carrier as a baby shower gift but I felt that it had too many straps and seemed complicated. I exchanged that one for this snugli comfort vent carrier and I loved it! It's easy...simple to strap on. I had taken my two month old back to my home country and this was such a lifesaver at the airports and waiting in cues. The only thing I found hard is to put the baby facing forward and fold down the head support..I think that could use a little improvement. Overall it's a good product for a great price!
2,Not That Great,"While some people may find that the snugli carrier is ideal for them, I have found that it is not so for me. While It is easy to get the baby in and out of the carrier, it is not easy on one's back. There are no lower straps, so all the weight is put on your upper back. After about fifteen minutes of carrying my baby, I get a backache. Considering that I carried my baby a lot, this meant I got a backache a lot. Also, while the snugli supposedly carries babies up to 26 pounds, I found that my son started feeling like he was a tight fit at 14 pounds."
3,Handy--but,"My child hates a stroller/carseat, so this product is handy & does save your back; however it's difficult to walk very fast because his legs hit mine as we walk-which jars him"
3,"don't like it, and neither does baby.","I got this as a gift, and I thought I would give it a try... that way I wouldn't have to fork out the $$ for the other much more expensive version. Well, neither one of us felt very good with it, the straps weren't padded enough and I kept feeling like at any minute my baby would fall out. Just felt like there needed to be more to it. It didn't work out for us. We ended up buying the ""other"" one. Maybe when she's older and weighs a little more I'll feel better with it."
1,wrong color,The snugli displayed was blue & black in color but the one I recieved was khaki which was very disappointing as I had ordered it because I liked the color combination in particular.So be careful when u order this product as there is no guarantee that the displayed color will be sent to u.Also the snugli was not clean so I assume it was a used one or was kept in the warehouse for a long time where it collected all that dust...
2,Not worth the back pain,"I received this as a shower gift. I've used it many times. I discovered that I really love to wear my baby as opposed to pushing her around in the stroller. It's so nice to be able to ""hold"" her when she is upset and still have my hands free to do other things, like housework or cooking dinner. I have several different baby carriers ranging from the snugli to ring slings. My feelings on the snugli are this...It doesn't have any sort of back support and after a good hour or so of wearing my baby in the snugli, my back and neck are screaming. I've read that the snugli is bad for baby's hips, too, so that doesn't make me feel to great about it. I recently borrowed the BEST carrier from a friend, it's called and ERGO baby carrier. It is the best thing ever invented!!!!! It is soft and supports my back and neck, ugh, I could go on and on and on. I say, skip the cheesy snugli and invest in an ERGO!!!"
4,Nice item for the price,I really do like this item and it is priced great but it always feels like my little 2 month olds face tends to be smushed to my chest and she likes to look around but she her neck isn't quite strong enough to be front facing. Maybe I'll like it more then.
4,Looking for book 4,"I loved all three books in the Secret Refuge series until the end of book 3. Snelling does an outstanding job of developing the characters and their stories. I couldn't put the books down. But now I feel betrayed as she left all the characters and their stories unresolved. What happened to Twin Oaks, to Louisa, to Zachary etc. For that reason it was hard to give this book 4 stars. She owes her readers a Book 4."
3,Underwhelmed,"Although I liked the series, this final novel was kind of a let down. It wasn't quite as enthralling as the other two. I felt it kind of concluded quickly and could have been more detailed."
1,Duplication,The same author has actually published exactly the same book (same contents) under Pelanduk Publications (M) Sdn Bhd in Malaysia under the title : Chinese Hand Analysis and calling himself Shifu Terence Dukes - title self-bestowed?I agree with the orther reviewer who was less than complimentary.
2,Disgusted,"Very,disgusted. When,my Husband put it together none of the wood was labeled. It,was a nightmare to put together. Also,they did'nt give us enough peg's. With,the wood not being labeled he put the bracket on the wrong piece had to invent something to remove it because it wassquare not round."
3,Excelente caña para iniciarse en pesca de troleo...,"Esta caña es una buena opción para iniciarse en la pesca tipo troleo. Al ser bastante larga la caña, es muy excitante la lucha con el pez.El único defecto detectado en este combo, son los remaches que sostienen el carrete de su base de acero, los remaches se me oxidaron y partieron los cuatro y casi pierdo el carrete..."
5,End of Innocence,"Emotionally violent loss of innocence by Parents and Children occurs during interaction with Child Protective Services in false allegations of abuse.Our treasured history and civics class sense of ""rights"" and ""innocent until proven guilty"" are sickening casualtiesas families and children are destroyed in the name of doing good.Up against a behemoth bureacracy with endless power, resources and ""craziness"", the innocent American is stunned by the occurrences. Dean Tong's book is essential to every family embroiled in the sticky web of CPS. From the author's personal experience and vast research, this book gives parents a fighting chance of preserving their families and their own self. ESSENTIAL!!!"
5,Incredible,"This CD is worth it just for the ""Mysterious Ways"" cover, which brings a smile to my face no matter how many times I've heard it. The rest of the tracks are also interesting to listen to, and KKMFDM did a really good job showing the variety of their music in this CD."
5,Good for the long time fan of kmfdm,"I recommend this cd to the long time listener, it is a good compilation of rara kmfdm material that sounds very industiral."
2,What happened here?,"O.K. I love KMFDM as much as the next rivethead, but what happened here. Adios is wonderful. And we all are wondering why this stuff is unreleased."
3,not their best,I like KMFDM a lot but Agogo is not the best work I have seen the band do. Their other albums have a higher level of intensity and creativity then Agogo. It just seems that Agogo was but toghether by their record company knowing that it would be one the last times they would be able knowing that the band would break up soon. There are good songs on here like the cover of U2's mysterious ways and is defenetely good for the die-hard KMFDM fans
2,Not worth it unless you want a complete collection,"I'm a real fan of KMFDM's mid to later work, and I just didn't care for this album. The title cut is interesting, but it's about all I cared for. The alternate mixes of the old hit tracks are not as good as the ones we're all used to. I'm keeping it as part of my collection, but this isn't one I'll be listening to very much."
4,"KMFDM, doing it again","I thought this was a pretty good CD, but not great. Some of the songs were pretty good. Godlike and A Hole in the Wall are good songs, but I have come to expect great songs from KMFDM, like Money, Anarchy and Megalomaniac, which are nowhere to be found here. It is just a little to techno for my taste. Agogo is also a mere 40 minutes, which leaves me wanting more, but it is still a good addition for a fan who has all of the other CDs"
5,Good time guys!,My little brother went to high school with these guys and dragged me to a show years ago. I still listen to a CD I'm sure they burned in their garage. This one is even better I hope they are back to stay. I would love to see them in concert again 15 years later.
3,Andes is on duty chasing the skirts more than the enemy!,"Did not dwell too long on first reviewer's ad for this film. Now, let's go to the film itself and a real review. Andes seems to be so busy romancing Susan Cabot and Philipino glamor beauty Paraluman that he doesn't find much time to organize and lead his troops of civilians and headhunters to defeat the Japanese. The script in fact seems to overplay the bravery of his female soldiers and spies more than his own--after all, Paraluman is captured and dies in a sacrifice for their victory. His speech while accepting a medal from Gen. McArthur about having ""learned to love another race"" was one of the film's best points. The trailer did go overboard in promoting risque scenes and suggesting more was there than ever really was."
3,Surrender Hell!,I got what i had expected. A grade B movie about a book I had just finished. It was a classic love in war movie. I am glad I bought a used one.
2,"Works as designed, but it broke","This is not a high quality tool, but it works for occasional use. I had two problems. First, the flexible cable is held onto the head of the gauge with a press-in 'rivet'. That rivet came loose and the cable separated. I repaired it by threading the rivet hole and installing a set screw. The second problem is that the 1/2 inch drive fits very loosely onto a ratchet and socket. This sloppy fit makes the gauge somewhat inaccurate and the gauge tends to fall off the ratchet when moving it about.And a general comment. There is some free play between all ratchet, socket and accessory (extensions) parts. Make sure that you take up that free play with some slight pressure on the wrench in the same manner when reading both the starting point and finish point."
4,Nice item,"Great for torquing motorcycle heads when the engine is out of the frame, but too tall for some in frame work"
4,Basic torque angle gauge,"This isnt a fancy gauge, but since you usually are doing basic angles (90, 180, etc.) this works great. sets up fast, works good. Im an ASE Master Tech and shop forman at a large dealership doing warranty work all the time, and this is what I use more often than the shops digital gauge. Cant beat the price vs. usage!"
4,A fascinating experience,"I have been lucky enough to be able to buy the LP version recently, factory sealed! This is a fascinating performance in every way, the last performance of Flagstad in Götterdämmerung, and she sings wonderfully throughout. Please note that another laber WALHALL has published this performance recently and at a super bargain price!"
3,Review of motorola right angle adapter,I have been looking for this item for months and was so excited to find it- however when I got it the right angle was in the wrong direction. Of the four possible directions that a right angle could have been only one that I can't use is this one- It does appear to be made well and I would certainly use it if I could
3,Works with my TomTom One,"I bought this to replace the in-car charger for my TomTom one. Rather than spend $40 (or whatever ridiculous amount TomTom wants for a new in-car charger) I bought this adapter and used a standard mini-usb cable -> usb car power adapter to power the TomTom. I had to do this because, if I just used the mini usb cable alone, the TomTom won't sit on the dash properly. Overall, it's just a small adapter that should probably be way cheaper but it was easier to order online then run around to different stores hoping they have it. Given that it works fine for the TomTom I suspect it also will supply power to any other mini usb device. I have not tried data, however, so I have no idea if all the USB connections are wired up properly."
5,Works with Garmin Nuvi,"I am using this to keep my Garmin Nuvi 360 powered up while driving. I didn't know this when I got it, but if the Garmin is plugged in and not using battery power, it automatically turns on when the car is turned on (that's what I get for not reading the instruction manual, lol).To have a cleaner appearance in the car, I have the mini-usb plugged into the ball mount that is holding the GPS and not plugged into the GPS itself. Unfortunately, that port is really close to the ball mount which restricts it's movement when plugged in. With the adapter, it makes the cable less intrusive and makes the GPS free to adjust with the ball mount to nearly any position desired. In combination with a 1.50 mini-usb cable, probably the cheapest way to keep my Nuvi charged while driving!!"
5,solid anime,"Generator Gawl is one of the finest animes I've ever seen. It's not overdone, like the way some other series seem to be (or try to be, in some cases). The comedy is hilarious, the action is outstanding, the plot is rewarding, the animation is spectacular, and they all balance exceptionally well. This series (and this disk in particular) are a must-have for any hardcore anime freak like myself."
3,It just gets hotter,"If you like the first one then you'll love the second one. In this Overcome with guilt about his involvement in generator creation,Overcome with guilt about his involvement in generator creation, Ryo breaks rank and confronts Professor Nekasa in order to stop the discovery that led to Gawl's transformation and the future calamity. Though Koji and Gawl are unaware of his plan, the mysterious (and dangerous) Ryuko Saito is more than alert to Ryo's intentions. And as Ryuko intimidates Ryo and wickedly toys with Koji, advanced and more powerful generators from the future come back for Gawl. Their bolder, increasing vicious attacks begin to weaken Gawl - and come dangerously close to the young girl Gawl has befriended."
3,Agency of Africans,"John Thornton, author of numerous studies centering around Atlantic Africa, presents a history of the slave trade which attempts to focus on (forced) African migration. He tackles approaches taken by scholars such as Mintz and Price to discuss developing New World cultures. Unfortunately, despite his interesting and important ideas and assertions, chapter 7 presents a disturbing view of a homogeneous African culture. One of this book's redeeming features is the agency attributed to African peoples. The (sometimes prevalent) idea that Africans were passive victims in the Atlantic slave trade is overturned."
3,"Great History of the Slave Trade, But Boring","This probably is one of the best histories of the Atlantic slave trade available. While extremely scholarly, it lacks some of the sociological and psychological angles that would have made it more readable."
3,GREAT,This book greatly portrayed the African American culture and their movement in American comparative world history.
4,A barren dune,"This release from Monolake consists of one 36-min track. This is about as far removed from the Chain Reaction/Basic Channel dubby techno as possible, and when you hear this EP be sure to remember its title as you sit and listen. This is the sound of a desert, not necessarily literally, but it's appropriate nonetheless. Crickets chirp and electronics purr and click, but a beat never comes in, and nothing really happens. It's stubbornly ambient, and I think that's highly respectable in a time that our attention spans have grown so short."
5,Excellent product! Good price!,This is a great-sized shaker that can make multiple drinks at once (even multiple doubles). Requires very little ice to make liquids cold quickly. Hasn't had any leaks or anything. Very pleased.
5,Wonderful!,Ya sure will look stylish making a drink from this mixer! Well made and beautiful! I was very lucky to receive this as a gift =)
1,"Looks great, but.....","This shaker looks really classy and has that ""wow"" effect - BUT, it is impossible to separate the lid and the tube! I had read about this (major) shortcoming in another review, but figured it couldn't be that bad - guess what? IT IS. I've had it for 4 weeks and have tried everything - heat, cold, brute strength - yet still can't get it open. I'd send it back, but I threw away all the wrappings. It looks really neat on the bar, though - now, if it would only work...."
2,Piece of stainless steel trash,"I'll be brief. It's not true stainless, the design is OK, nothing special, looks like a sex toy to be honest with you. It feels extremely cheap, thin steel, poor workmanship, visible dents and dings from the machining process - I would give it 5 stars if it was $5.99. This thing is being returned asap, a true lo-grade quality product."
4,A Look In To The Donald,"Master Apprentice provides an eye opening view for Trump first timers in to the life ""The Donald"". Trump appears more a master ""salesman"" than ""apprentice"" in his legendary efforts for power, prestige and notoriety in Manhattan real estate. A good read.Jeremy HillJB Capital Management"
3,Mostly just retreads from her wonderful trilogy of the Trump family,"I enjoyed her book on the Trump family history especially about the grandfather. This book however disappointed me. I found it to be a knockoff of the original trilogy with very little new material. Just being honest. I'm a true Trump devotee so I read everything out there on him, whether written by him or someone else."
1,I absolutely hate it,"I bought this system online and waited with installing it a few months. After only a couple of weeks, it started to beep to signal that the battery was low even when it was not armed. I changed the battery but nothing changed. And then it started to beep often and long for no reason. There is no way stopping the beep. The sensor also makes weird sounds when there is movement even when the system is not armed.Another problem is that somebody who knows how the system works can simply unplug the device and take the battery out. It will take merely 5-10 seconds to do that.I finally took it down and looking for a more reliable system."
4,Good easy-to-use easy-to-install alarm system,"I have bought this alarm system a couple of weeks ago. It fits perfectly my needs.In a nutshell :Pros :* Reasonable Price* Very simple to install (30 minutes)* Very easy to useCons :* In case of a break in, the core alarm system beeps before the alarms starts. So it is pretty easy for an intruder to locate the alarm and destroy it. So I recommend to buy a additionnal remote keypad and have the core alarm system in a location where the beeps cannot easy be heard by intruders."
2,Excited & Disappointed,I was so excited to get this alarm system. We got it out & I realized that it is made out of poor quality. I've kept it because I felt I had no other option. FYI The alarm system is so loud wear earplugs to set it up.
2,Would love to try product but...,"After reading all the great reviews of this security system here on Amazon I decided to order it for my studio apartment. Unfortunately, I have not been able to set it up due to the fact that the screw on the back of the motion sensor is screwed down so tight I cannot get the back of the motion sensor off in order to put the battery inside. Due to this fact, trying to set up this security system has been an extremely frustrating experience."
4,Good value for the money,"I read the customer reviews carefully and thoroughly - advisedly purchased the necessary extra components. I advise more caution about how you package the added parts and pieces. All in all it installed pretty easily and does what we wanted it to do. A quibble, they do not send enough hardware! Come on, folks. What can it cost you to send a few more plastic anchors and screws? Even the extra sensors that I ordered and the external alarm had no installation hardware with it. Too cheesy! But for under $300 I have a complete working system that will deter the bad guys or at worst let me know they have arrived. As others noted, read the manual very carefully and follow all directions scrupulously."
2,"Decent Product, Customer Service lacking","I had my SC-100 for about 6 months when the speaker stopped working, the solder joint on the back of the speaker came off. It's made in China, so I wasn't too surprised, but getting it fixed was a hassle. Customer support offers very little assistance even though it was still under warranty. At this point it's easier for me to buy a new speaker and fix it then to send it in a be without a system for who knows how long. Just something to be aware of if you do have a problem."
3,Security System Skylink - Go for the delixue kit and extra siren instead!,This system is easy to install and works very well.Strengths:Easy to InstallWorks WellSiren is Piercingly LoudNo False Alarms YetWorks Well with Additional Sensors PurchasedWeaknesses:Cannot Recode the Orginal Motion Sensor to the correct zone - I am following directions carefully!Dialer is Not that GreatBeeps when set off so criminal can locate walk over and disable before alarm goes off.would be good if powercords could be screwed into wall socket pate so people can't unplug as easily.My recommendation is to go with the skylink deluxe kit (without dialer) and add the additional alarm siren to the system.
4,Safe at last!,I purchased this alarm system about a year ago. I am using it with motion sensors only.My comments:This is a quality system for the price paid.The manual is complex and requires a lot of study.The motion sensors are very sensitive on the high setting.Low setting with motion sensors works well.Battery life for motion sensors is good.The siren is very loud--it should panic any intruder--It scares me!Once set up properly this unit works flawlessly.
1,Never worked right,"Bought the whole set plus extra senors, and have had nothing but trouble with this set. One of the sensors stopped working one week later, the remote has never worked at all, and the emergency dialer stopped working after eight months, I have called customer support twice and they have not been able to help me at all. I would not recommend this unit to anyone."
1,Don't buy one!,"The product support is deplorable!The motion sensor received was defective. I contacted the manufacturer and was told I would have to send the sensor back to them. I sent the unit back and received a delivery confirmation that the product had been received. I have contacted the company many times, over a period of a month and a half, I have not received the unit back and have only received promises from the company that it would be sent. Save your money, buy a different unit"
5,Bang for the buck!,Great product at a great price. The alarm is LOUD. Installation is easy but the programming was a bit of a challenge as the manual is not very organized. The preprogrammed features were not quite what I wanted but I managed to program my needs. The remote dialer works up to about 30 feet away and through at least 2 thick walls. The dialer recording is tinny and hard to understand so speak slowly. It is also a good idea to write down what you want to say.
2,The system last only 4 months.,Installation was extremely easy. The provided double-sided tapes installing the the sensors an easy task. The keypad which includes the siren died after only about 4 months of use. The siren simply died and would no longer work.
1,Don't Waste Your Money If You Have A Large Area To Protect!,"I purchased this based on Amazon reviews. It works in theory but not practice. Its main downfall is the range that the sensors can communicate with the main keypad. Put a wall in the way and no joy. So unless you live in a one room apartment or only want to secure part of your living space - don't bother with this. The manufacturers support operation is pretty non existent. I have since gone with a used ADT system (without the monthly monitoring), a generic dialer and generic sensor that picks up the ADT chime sound."
2,Works great at first...,Product was as advertised. Easy to install and operate. Out of no where two months in though the brain unit stopped functioning. So if you need a temporary security system then this one is the one for you.
2,NOT A GOOD SYSTEM AT ALL!,"Be aware that this system has a major design flaw. If you have any door with a door sensor on it and it is accidentally left open by a child or someone on the way out, the alarm will ignore that sensor and arm with your door wide open and not go off. You could leave your home with the garage open, or any entrance fully open, and not know it! Or, if any motion sensor becomes defective or battery goes dead, that area is ignored by the alarm and you will never know it has gone bad as the alarm will arm normally."
1,Expect nothing from this system,"Cutting to the chase, you cannot control this system remotely! If a sensor is tripped you cannot re-set it by telephone or internet. Net, net, an alarm cannot be turned off and the system re-armed remotely. Most helpful when you are 1000 miles away from your home!!! I typically read a few 5 star reviews, a few 1 star reviews, and more or less believe the 3 star reviews. I purchased this system based on that philosophy. In this case a BAD MOVE!!! First, the system was supposed to include the newer dialer the AD 433S. I received a package labeled ""SC1000"" with the old AD 105 dialer which was defective (would not dial out). AMAZON WORTHY OF HIGH PRAISE! When informed of these problems provided freight charge free return and a credit to my account even though they merely fulfilled the order for a third party vendor."
3,"Works well, but features are disappointing","I bought and installed this system, it is easy to install and program, but the features are limited and actually deceiving. I bought the SC1000 system and a temperature alarm and a water alarm. Well, you can do that and have the dialer connect to all of it, but you will get only one type of notification. In other words, you can record only one message. So, if a door is opened you get notification. If the temperature falls too low, you get the same notification. If my water line bursts, same notice. So, I have installed and armed the security system, the water and temp alarms are headed back to Amazon. Not sure how long I will use the system due to the limitations. It would seem overly simple for Skylink to include features for multiple notification types especially with the prevalence of caller ID."
2,Wireless,"I was disappointed since apparently you need a land line in order to hook up the auto dialer, but other then that it was worth the money."
1,Unsatisfied,"The Skylink Sc 1000 worked fine, however, the accompanying sensors did not work properly. They either failed to link with the command module or they operated when I moved them in a certain angle. Setup was attempted twice with the same results."
3,this system is not properly tested by the manufacturer,"SC-1000 works OK in default configuration, but once you start tinkering with Advanced Programming or adding new elements to the system pretty soon you'll get across of all kind of problems (read my other reviews on this subject). If you've purchased this system keep it ""as is"" or you become unpaid volunteer-product tester for Skylink, Inc."
4,So Far So good,"Well I installed my system yesterday, didn't really have any trouble. I already got my first false alarm though. I'm sure it's the dang cats setting off the motion. I spose I will have to point it up or move it higher. One thing I would like to see is the option to make this thing completely silent, in other words, never sound the loud beeper, but call with the dialer, like a holdup alarm. Or, perhaps make the thing dial me right away, then sound the loud alarm like 2 minutes later. Does anyone know how to do this? So far, I love this system though. I will probably buy more window sensors, and maybe another motion. Has anyone used a motion or window sensor in their detached garage, or any other creative ways? i may put a vibe sensor on the boat outside...I spose the only negative at this point is the quality of the housing, I would like it a little more solid, but you get what you pay for I suppose. But with the dialer, this is a bargain."
5,Pleasantly pleased!,Great product! Performs as stated in the description.I definately recommend this product! Get it before you signany contract with a monitoring service.
4,Worked as advertised,"I bought and installed this system in my home to get some peace of mind while being away for the holidays. It works as advertised. Programming the system requires some reading but is relatively easy. One thing that worried me was in case of false alarm, who's going to shut it off for me? My trusted neighbor was also gone for the holidays and my friends were not always around to help either. So I decided to just engage the dialer to see if the system was reliable. It was. Being away a few days without receiving any call from the system gave me peace of mind. As soon as I was back and walked into my door, the motion detector triggered and send a call to my cell phone. I have an IP camera at home and can verify if there are intruder, so I think it would be great if the system allows me to turn off the siren remotely via internet in case of false alarm or some family members accidentally trigger the system. This is maybe something the designer should think of for the next version."
3,So far ok but except you can't change the timing setup,"I just bought a new set of Skylink SC-1000 in early of Jan. So far the product works good for me. The price is reasonable and the setup is easy. But the only issue is you cannot change the ""time"" setup. When you're back home, the system will allow you up to 30 seconds to disarm the alarm. To me, this is too long because if a burglar broke in to the house, he can hear ""beep beep beep"" sound and know there's an alarm system in the house. He may break up the alarm system within 30 seconds before the alarm is on. I already called the manufacturer if I could change the time setting to 15 seconds or make the ""beep"" sound off, unfortunately the technical support told me this is the default setup and I coulldn't make any change."
2,Didn't work out,"We are currently under contract to one of those home monitoring companies and are looking to get something on our own and out of their contract. We had hoped this would be the one.Unfortunately we had a number of times when the alarm would go off for no reason. I don't need false alarms to drag me home from work or create unnecessary panic. We made adjustments and did some trouble shooting, but the phantom alarms continued.Installing the unit is very easy and the instructions are clearcut to use. But when we called the company to ask questions about the product, we only received one call back (when we were not home), and after we returned the call, we never heard back from them again. Perhaps it was just some glitch or miscommunication. But we've decided to continue looking until we find the right match."
5,Skylink SC-1000,You can't put a price tag on family safety and this system is great.I would recommend every family should have it. Best of all you don't have to pay for monitoring fees.
3,Short back up battery life,"A quick additional note to the excellent reviews so far.The back up battery may be able to handle brief electrical outages but not major ones. Once the battery has run down the ""low battery"" light comes on and stays on even after you install a new one. In addition to the light staying on the control unit also beeps several time each minute. An email to the manufacturer asking if there was a reset button or other technique was answered by a generic ""return the unit for inspection"" answer. Not easy from Costa Rica! The correct answer should have been ""yes"", unplug the unit and remove the battery for at least 2 hours (I had tried 1 minute). I have now replaced the 9V back up battery with a 12V motorcycle battery; seems to work well but this was not suggested but the manufacturer. Otherwise read the other helpful comments about poor instructions and consider tying the dialer to the main control panel and not the individual sensors."
4,Fun for whole family,This was purchased for a three-year-old but was immediately played with by older brother and sister too. It is the second geo-trak (after a train set) and will undoubtedly furnish many hours of enjoyment for all three. We hit the jackpot with this one.
5,Ideal for young children,"This is my three-year-old son's favorite part of the GeoTrax system. After he got this for his birthday it got lost in the shuffle and wasn't brought out for several weeks. After his first time playing with it however, we wondered why we hadn't gotten it out sooner. While it may not connect well to the other GeoTrax, it keeps him well entertained while we spend time setting up the other tracks."
2,Not very exciting for the price,"We got this last year to add to our geotrax collection, and TOOK IT BACK. My 3 are much more into trains and we thought that it would work with the geotrax set in some way, which it does not. I may be great for kids that love planes or as a stand alone toy, but my kids got tired of pulling the lever and watching the plane spin in a circle. Not impressed at all for Geotrax, I think it would have been better for the Little People sets."
4,My little pilot LOVES IT!,"My son loves anything that has to do with planes...so, I thought he might like this for his 3rd B-Day. He had lost some interest in the Geotrax trains, this has brought him right back to playing with them again. Now there is more ""action"" happening at the 'ol train tracks. This is a seperate feature, does not attach to the tracks. Great sounds, lots of fun, the only negative comment is that the ""stick"" used to raise and lower the planes is a bit too close to the landing strip and the planes will brush your child's hand on occasion. WORTH THE MONEY!"
2,Monica seems to be a chip off the old block,"Monica Mancini seems to have a beautiful voice that will please the listener. I feel like she is on the way to a wonderful career in music.For this project Monica elected to sing some of her fathers evergreens. This is not a bad idea! Henry wrote many wonderful tunes over his hughly successful career. The only draw back I have about this cd is that on some of the songs I didn't think the arrangement was very well crafted. Also on the song ""Dreamsville"" Monica decided to sing this song as a duet with Johnny Mathis. I didn't like that duet.I think it is fair to say that this is a cd worthy of your purchase."
5,Haunting,"I first heard Monica Mancini singing her father's songs on the PBS special. From there, I did a quick search for any CDs by her and was thrilled to find this one! I have been transported back in time while listening to Monica's wonderfully, haunting voice singing her father's songs. I've enjoyed her so much that I have since purchased more of her CDs to share with friends (my pocketbook is showing a deep dent as a result). I'm looking forward to hearing more of her work... Thank you, Monica!"
5,Monica Mancini,"Monica Mancini has a very good voice and range, and has obviously learned much musically from her father. She sings many of his songs with great depth..."
1,Dumb,"Dumb, noncreative stereotypes, no story, no acting, no nothing (double negative?). However, if you're an insecure rejected teen this will continue your fantasy stardom and provide the slapstick humor you never grew out of. The usual studio teen themes of alcohol, drugs, hot tubs (or pool), a few boobs and pretend sex, trashing - it's all comic book there.Four/five star reviewers came from the aforementioned demographic.Three star reviewers safely indecisive.Kudos to the studio & producers for the latest tactic to squeeze more blood (money) to not include Special Features unless you pay extra.Kudos to the studio & producers for the unimaginative copycatting of the too often used and cheap actor with handheld camera documenting vehicle."
3,Tons o fun,"This is a stupid movie. This movie was also a lot of fun to watch, and I found myself getting swept up in the ride, laughing at parts almost against my will. Not recommended for feminists."
2,Waste of money,I can't believe they even call this a movie...it's more like watching a huge concert in a suburban home. If you watch the previews you've basically seen the entire movie. I wish I could get my money back. a huge waste of my time and money.
4,Funny Funny Movie,"I wanted to see this when it was at the theater but never got to see it, wish I did but it is well worth renting and seeing on the smaller screen too, I should buy it to watch again."
4,Instant Laughter,"Enjoyed the multiple cameras presenting the movie from different characters point of views. Movie built for pure laughter! lacks a serious storyline but with teens, the more random, the better."
1,UGH...,"Another dumb movie, it has like two good scenes, its just another one of those movies that you wish you could've just watch the preview which happens to have the only good parts of the movie, just for dumb kids to watch, i think directors should come with better scrips"
3,don't rent the stream,"Low quality rental stream, buy the dvd if you'd rather have a good picture, nice surround sound though, am I suppose to rate the movie?? oops"
5,best movie ever. hands down.,"saw this movie on HBO and after I saw it I knew I had to buy it. it was perfect plotted, had the right music at the party and all the crazy events tied it together. perfect acting. thomas mann is so yummy and he is the main character. that makes the move 3 times better. this is something I'll never regret buying. :) it ships fast too. I got it 3 days before the expected delivery date!"
3,Another High School party movie,It was funny...and a little different...but typical high school teen movie...with plenty of under age drinking....and 18 year old boobies..lol
1,Unless you are a Stoner --it's a WASTED DATE!,"Not only are the characters seemingly wasted, but so is your money unless you like inane, stoner humor, or at least something that pretends to be humor. From the early previews I thought this was some kind of sci-fi flick, you knows, kids have a party while parents are out of town and aliens land and destroy the hood. NOPE! No such luck. It's just STOOPIT! I had to spell it like that because stupid doesn't come close, plus I has t'roin' a little NY accent in there, for those of you who already watched this waste of time. Drugs are NOT GOOD people! That is why the nation is in the stank hole its in now."
3,fun and interesting,Good movie not as good as i thought it would be but it was still something different and new. ;la
1,THE WORST MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE...,HORRIBLE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. IF YOU WATCH THIS YOUR BRAIN WILL ROT. IF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS REALLY ACT LIKE THIS...SMH... EVERY 30 SECONDS THE MOVIE FLASHES TO A SLOWED DOWN MOVEMENT DANCING SCENE AND IT SUCKED.
1,Terrible!!!!,"This wasn't a movie, this was 88 minutes of wasted time. I cant believe the amount of positive reviews this got, unbelievable. John Hughes & this thing should never be in the same sentence. Comparing John's work to Nima Nourizadeh is disrespectful and disgraceful to J.Hughes fans throughout. Warner Bros. should be embarrassed for releasing this stuff under their name. Blind buyers beware, rent first! It wouldn't surprise me to see this in the $1 bin very soon, and even then, it's overpriced."
5,funny movie,"The item is great and works as described. I would purchase this again if asked. Dont worry, Buy with confidence!"
1,Worst Movie EVER!,"This was possibly the worst movie ever. It actually frightens me that people could be stupid enough to think up something like this. For instance Not one action that occured in this movie would be allowed to happen in real life. The plot is almost non-existant, other than the continual quest to ""finger bang"" a chick, and to throw a large party to become popular, there really is no plot. Quite possibly the worst part was the ending, which there is a lack of satisfaction due to the fact that the kid burned down half of his block and his parents just let him get away with it..... In short, I would rather clean the toilet than be forced to watch this movie again."
1,another party movie.,"This might be ok if you cared about the characters at all. But they are annoying whiners and this flick is just another flick about teens wanting to party. Only unlike other party movies that can be sorta fun this one is about these guys wanting to be BIG SHOTS. This was a huge bomb coming from a major studio and it doesn't have much humour even as compared to the hangover. Which is just as dumb and about partying too. This one though would annoy teens even as there is NO plot really. just a extended party video or just a music video with no reason to call itself a movie, and teens avoided this movie as much as everyone else did so even they realized this one was not a movie. The blu ray looks good but it's not staying in my collection that is for sure. I did keep the hangover films though. Those are good dumb party movies."
2,Well .....,"Hmmm, what can I say about this movie? I guess it lived up to its billing, and there's really only so much you can do with this kind of premise. Maybe I just wanted so kind of big twist, some life-altering events that really hit home. I guess I didn't get any of that, so I can only give it 2 stars. Eh ....."
3,not bad not great,"some humor, somewhat boring at parts, a little over the top with the partying, not bad over all. is not must see, but good weekend flick."
2,Misleading description--definitely not the best for the money.,"I ordered this for my parents' computer in an attempt to solve the problem of too few (and poorly located) ports on their system. However, we specifically ordered this hub because of the advertised 30"" cable. The actual cable length, however, is only 23""--which means it does not stretch up onto the desk, and one must crawl underneath to plug and unplug usb devices. My parents are older, and this is a hardship for them. The hub itself works ok--one of the ports is fiddly and works only intermittently--but the short cord makes it very inconvenient. There are too many other options out there for this sort of product in the same price range--definitely choose a different one. I was very disappointed, especially since it was a gift."
4,Works great,"Looks kind'a cheaply made, but works great. Say's the cord is 7.5"" long, but it's closer to a foot long. I have a printer, flash memory stick and a wireless receiver for a mouse plugged into it. It's plugged into a netbook which has enough USB ports but they're in the wrong place."
2,Not enough power,"I have an extension cord for this to get to the back of my PC. When I plug things into this thing, they simply are not recognized, such as a simple Sandisk 4GB Memory pen drive. Maybe it is because of the extension cord... I figured this would be underpowered. I love the targus one. It takes two ports on the PC but you get 4 so you net two."
4,Simple. Easy. and No software needed.,"This is great for multiple USB devices. I mainly use it for game pads, and they all work well when plugged into this HUB. The only downside to this was that it wasn't as blue as pictured in the photo, instead its more of a darker blue, almost green in certain lights.But it's fine overall."
1,"It works, but.....","I would recommend spending a few more dollars and getting something a little better made an more reliable. When I plug a jump drive in to this, sometimes the computer doesn't 'see' it. I also have the 6 port hub from cables to go. It's much better made and it works great."
1,Not Win7 Compatible?,"According to the packaging and the Sabrent website, this USB hub is supposed to be compatible with Win7. However, when I attempted to use it with a Win7 laptop, I received an installation error and it will not read from any of the 4 ports. I then tried using it in a computer running XP and it worked fine. I tried another Win7 laptop and has the same issue - installation error, not reading from the ports. I tried using a port on my docking station and was able to get the hub to install. However, still will not read from the ports. I tried all 4 ports and different USB flash drives, but received the same result - the drive appears in the list of drives, but is listed as ""empty."""
1,Returned two of these to Amazon,"I purchased this because it looked like a nifty little USB port to have. Within five minutes of opening the box, I had printed a return label, and asked for an exchange. The second one was also dead, so I printed a return label and asked for a refund. At the same time I purcahsed the first one, I purchased a Targus ""Bend-a-hub"" for just a few dollars more. It works great."
2,Thumb drive /Card Reader use,I could not get it to work with uploading photos to the PC. It kept dropping and reestablishing the connection. So do not buy it for peripherals that need two way communication like cameras or drives or printers or scanners.
5,long wire,It is splendid for being attached by a long wire to the computer so you have a place to put it on a crowded desk
3,USB HUB,the description of this product says it is a high speed 2.0 hub. but my computer tells me its 1.1 & i should use 2.0 for a faster transfer.
4,Great value!,"This was a nice and inexpensive, straight-forward product. The cord is very short, but that's about my only complaint."
4,It's been doing the job for me,"I've been using this USB hub for 6 months. It's been working fine without any problems.Yes, it is made of plastic and feels a little cheap. I bought this because it was the cheapest USB hub on Amazon, so I can't really complain. I use it everyday and it hasn't broken. The transfer rates are fine for my needs, even when transferring large photo files from my dSLR.I find the ports to be a little snug, but not tight like some reviewers state. I wish that the cable was a little longer though."
1,Where Is The Article?,"I was expecting an in depth article about a women over 40 having a child and the effects of this on her and her child. Instead, this is 300 words written in quote format with no substance or insight whatsoever. Where exactly is the 7000 word article? Is it possible to give a negative star rating?"
1,Broken on Arrival and stuck in the socket!!!,"What a WASTE of time and money, I ordered this product and waited to put it in initially. When I did, it did Not work, then I went to remove the bulb so that I could return it - it will not come out of the socket, the former bulb came out easily and then I put in this faulty bulb, as I have in the past with other bulbs, without any problems. This was a waste of my money and how can i return an item that is STUCK!!!"
1,Inadequate Product Information,"50 Watt - MR16 - GU10 Base - Flood - 120 Volt - Halogen Light Bulb - GE 16751I want to continue to read in my living room, but have a lower electric bill. Can I do that with this bulb? How much light does this bulb put out? I do not know because the amount of light is measured in lumens. The product specifications do not include a number for lumens. Choosing a bulb today is more complicated than it was in the past when we had lots of energy in the world."
2,I was very disappointed,"I had higher hopes for this video, but sadly the inspiration was not there. This video does not rival The Secret in any way. Friedman's whole premise on why we don't get what we want is because we don't pay attention to our body sensations. However, in my experience, as a very intuitive person and one that has learned to pay very close attention to the physiology (a term he never used, but is what he is talking about) of my body, I've gotten burned many times when I did not listen. Friedman confesses to having an anxiety and other disorders, and this practice he calls the Thought Exchange worked for him. I agree if you have severe mental health disorders than practicing something as he has outlined might work, but not for the normal and healthy. Listen to your gut, listen to your body, otherwise you will regret it."
3,Nyeh ...,"The movie has some valuable ideas, but it isn't particularly captivating in style. The concept that sensations - not to be confused with feelings - can be responsible for our successes or failures was new to me. Failure to lose weight, for example, is caused by the unwillingness to accept and embrace the sensations we feel when we think about not being able to eat our favorite, fattening foods. I must admit that I've given this more than cursory thought as a result of watching this film. I have suffered for several years from near debilitating grief over losing someone I loved, and changing my approach to grief by dealing with it as a sensation has helped me a great deal. The thoughts in this film are worth considering; the appeal of its technical aspects are pretty bad ... hence my 3 star rating, smack dab in the middle of really good and really bad."
2,lots of wasted time,"I felt like they had something to say but could have summed it up into about 10 min ....tops. If youve seen the trailer, youve seen the film."
1,All talk and no real content. Repeats the same thing over and over again. Yawn!,"The Thought Exchange gave me little to think about. I was excited to spend $2.00 on this video hoping to be inspired, instead all I got out of it was the beginning and ending statements which were the same: be tuned into your ""sensibilities"". I had to fight to remain awake for the whole video, maybe it would have been better if I did go to sleep. I guess I got my money's worth, a dollar for the statement in the beginning and a dollar to reminded about the same statement in the end. I guess this video works well with most people, because psychologists have proven that most people only really listen to the beginning and ending of any instruction and miss or ignore or are distracted for the details in the middle. I would advise to anybody to go read a book, any book, even a children's book and you will definitely have exchanged many more thoughts than this video has to share."
1,The book is probably great...,...but I found this film disappointing. The interviewees are not good at expressing how the concepts have changed their lives. The author spends too much time looking dead into the camera espousing high brow concepts. Also the film quality runs the gamut from highly professional to tinny and poorly recorded. I'll have to read the book. This DVD was uninspiring and lacking in practical information. What a shame - I had such high hopes.
1,Just a big waste,The host seems to spend very little time teaching and mostly just takes jabs at other thought systems like The Secret and otherwise. I didn't pay to watch a contest nor an infomercial. Two very large thumbs down.
3,The Thought Exchange Practical Method of Moving Beyond Positive Review,"Movie was kind of hard to follow, had some interesting perspectives. I would recommend it for anyone looking to change perspectives within themselves."
4,Very thought provoking...,This film made me re-think many of my current views on belief & my life in general. I am glad that I took the time to watch this.
1,A disappointment,"The font was extremely difficult to read. The topics covered do not adequately represent even the major areas of philosophy. Assuming the reader survives the eye straining font, he or she might walk away with the impression that Socrates' ideas are all about secular humanism and modern liberalism. Included in this book are discussions of Zen Buddhism, being kind to trees, and the hackneyed ""diversity is good."""
4,Good sprinker,"Quality sprinkler head that stands up to being stepped on. Works well for kids running through without having to worry about breaking the sprinkler. Also works well for smaller flower beds/gardens. Not an extra large spray area, but don't think it is meant to hit as large of a range as a regular oscillating sprinkler. Haven't had trouble with it rusting on, but we have a rubber ring where it connects to the hose."
3,Angry male lead and poor communication leads to problems,I read a lot of Regency Romances so am fairly picky. There writing was good but the story reminded me of the romances of yesteryear where females were attracted to abusive men. Lord Brandsley the main character show dramatic swings between awkward caring and brutal silent doggedness. The heroine is little better. She is not honest and forthright leading to a good deal of confusion. Worth reading compared to a lot of modern authors but not satisfying.
3,The 100 Best Things I've Sold on eBay,"This book is great for those who have little, if any experience in the resale of anything that is old, obsolete, inherited, nor in the basic understanding of the potential value of resale items from all walks of life. This is not a guide of any kind or reference for those seeking to transition from in person buying & selling to online sales. There are good reference books for that.On the other hand, it does give dozens of excellent examples of how every item - no matter how seemingly insignificant, needs to be treated as potential value until investigated and evaluated to some degree. One should never assume that something is of no value to anyone."
1,What?,"A total waste of a book.Sorry, author- but most of us don't have rich relatives who give us weird and unusual things to sell on ebay.I wish it was more relavant."
2,**SO MUCH FICTION!**,"I think this book is a TOTAL waste. I mean, it has so much fiction in it! Like for example,they said that Zac plays with Power Rangers. NOT TRUE! I read in a chat on their website, that Zac said he DIDN'T play with Power Rangers. Sure, maybe when he was little, but I mean, come on! Also, it talks a little bit too much about his bros. I mean, the books about him isn't it? And also, it has all the same info! Who cares what his favorite color is! Everyone already knows his name, fav color, and birthday! It really needs to get updated. And last but not least, it has ugly pictures of them inside! And most of the pix, everyone has seen! Like when they performed live on the Today Show. When Zac wore that block sweatshirt with an orange-collared shirt underneath. NOT WORTH IT! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT!!! Buy, their official book instead!"
1,TRUST ME! IT'S TERRIBLE!,"Hey There Hanson Fanz! Trust me, don't waste your money on this book! I bought it and it was such a waste! So much false info, and pix everyone's seen like when Hanson performed on the Today Show in New York City! It just has all the same old boring info in it like how Hanson got started etc. etc. It's also REALLY short. I know I may be kinda hard on the author because it's a unauthorized book, but still! Matt needs to do some HANSON HOMEWORK!P.S. Buy the book ""Zac Attack! Hanson's Little Brother"". It was so good, that I couldn't put it down and it seemed like the author interviewed Zac herself!"
5,A Great Book On Zachary Walker Hanson,This book talks about the life of Zachary Walker Hanson. And how he started singing. And How He Made Lots Of Money.
2,Writing lacked flair; I stopped reading.,"John Marks' book ""The Wall"" was allegedly a NY Times ""notable book"", and that's what enticed me to buy ""Warn Torn."" I'm usually pretty good at separating the wheat blurbs from the chaff blurbs, but I totally failed on this occasion. I really did try to get develop an interest in the book, but Marks' writing style is devoid of any flavor. His powers of description are noticeably absent, being replaced by a collection of nouns which he thinks will evoke an image of Europe. Before he starts another book I suggest he first sits down to read everything he can by Alan Furst. Mr. Marks may have traveled widely in modern Europe, but he lacks the skill to write about it."
5,Beautiful,"This doll is absoluteley stunning.Her outfit is so stylish.This doll is nice for a collector or someone who wants to play with her.It is very hard for me to throw such a beauty away.Her make-up is realistic and glamourous.Chelsea's hair is an amazingly stunning color of red with beautiful blond streaks.She comes with a ton of accessories from make-up to bags, from jewelry to shoes and clothing.This doll is a must have for any child or collector."
2,I liked her for a little bit,"Chelsea is one of my favorite my scene characters and i was pretty disapointed with this one. i got her a few months ago for $18, and when i took her out of the box to display i noticed she had some kind of thing that looked like a greyish/bluish birth mark, which Chelsea isn't supossed to have. Her hair is very crunchy and dry and ruiens easily. If you want a good Chelsea doll , get Bling Bling Chelsea."
2,more things,"I love that toy but I think that you should put like a little shopping boutique in it because it would increase how many people would buy it because there would be more in it,but you wouldn't want to raise your prise!Another thing that would make people love it even more is if you put more accessories in it like errings or neaclaces aspeculy more clothes!please try some of these ideas!"
4,Fodor's adds full color to their guidebooks,"The See It series is finally allowing Fodor's to compete with the Eyewitness Travel Guides from DK Publishing which are always full of photos plus 3-D maps and diagrams. It was extremely helpful during the online research and planning of an upcoming trip. Previously I would typically not buy a book from Fodor's since I prefer to both see and read about a destination that I would like to learn more about and plan to visit.The Rome book is well done with lots of useful photos, clear descriptions, maps, ratings, and even walking tours. They have done an excellent job and I recommend it as an alternative to DK Eyewitness and to supplement the Rick Steves' advice focused book. I wish this book wasn't so bulky as the pages are thick and the book is taller than the average title. Overall a good choice for a travel book about Rome for the first or second time visitor."
5,It's refreshing to hear down to earth lyrics!,I gave this album to several friends for Christmas and it has become a bit hit. They love it so much that they are buying it for their friends. Joni seems to be a down to earth person who has a special warmth about her. There is a depth in her lyrics that we are not priveleged to experience with many artists. Her songs are fun to sing along with. I hope that Joni continues to make music. She has a great gift.
5,One heck of a terrific album from a genuine talent.,"A wonderful singer and songwriter. The only thing better than an early sunrise with fog wreathing the mesquite like Walmart bags and a couple of coyotes trotting home ahead of my scent with nary a backward glance and a warming sun breaking in over my shoulder is coming into the shadowy kitchen after running the dogs and listening to these songs replay over and over again. Come sing in far West Texas at the Sand Hills Stock Show and Rodeo this January, won't you please?"
5,Cowgirl Dreams,Everything was delivered as promised in less time than promised and was in great condition...Good job!!!!!
5,Pure country doesn't get any better than this!,"Now here's a real country music album by a true country girl. Joni Harms is not a city girl who wears cowboy boots and sings country songs. Joni is a true to heart country girl whose songs fit our hearts as comfortably as her boots fit her. The songs on Cowgirl Dreams reflect the love she has for her family, her home, and her music. From the heart-tugging ""Catalog Dreams"" to the foot stomping ""Two Steppin' Texas Blue"", Joni Harms successfully touches the hearts of all who hear her music. All 10 songs on this album where either written or co-written by Joni; and each song brings us a little closer to understanding who Joni Harms really is - a real Cowgirl whose Dreams have been recorded for us all to enjoy. Excellent album!"
4,Kevin Fingleton,"I can place very few debut albums in as high regard as I do for this record. This astounding record is placed miles higher than the debut albums from such obvious influences as Radiohead and Elliott Smith. There are so many Radiohead sound-a-like bands today who can't see the forest for the trees. Braindoll are the only group to touch upon the soul of that sound, to bring such complex and variety of emotions to the fore with their music. Stand-out tracks such as ""Above My Head"" and ""No Turn For Silence"", hint that a future masterpiece equalling Mercury Rev's 'Deserter's Songs' or Radiohead's 'OK Computer', could be in the reconning. We wait in anticipation."
4,good solid sounds...,sounds so fresh that makes lysol useless. a little country would not hurt the mix though.
1,"Terrible, Waste of Money",Buyer beware!! These handlamps are a wate of money. Complete junk. I recieved mine and took it out of the package and it did not work. I tried a different set of batteries because I thought that maybe the batteries that came with it were dead but it still didn't work. I thought for the price that it would work correctly but its not worth a penny.
3,Good for the price. Nice red light,Bought because it was within my price range and rated pretty well. Works well. Nice brightness and the red light is really convenient for star gazing and the likes. Feels a little cheap. Also the buttons are weird and switching between lights is akward.
5,Flesh and steel,"Koja explores the limits of flesh in SKIN,chronicling thedesire to transcend these limits in her own unique style.This is a great modern novel concerning extreme bodymodification and the physiological scars it leaves; itis also an accurate look at underground culture. Koja isone of our very best writers,and SKIN is a classic."
3,An okay book,"This was hardly the worst book I've ever read - but nothing really sets it apart from others in its genre.Hunter Sinclaire is a pretty good hero - lots of internal torment and a pretty interesting secret.Sabrina Barrington is a pretty good heroine. Pretty feisty - with her own secret agenda.Unfortunately, that's the best I can say about this book. There were too many side characters, too many issues, and too many secrets.The dialogue was okay. The romance okay. In my opinion, it wasn't a bad book. But it's not going to stay on my keeper shelf, either."
3,Hunter of My Heart,"I thought this book did not flow with the why's and where's or explain all the characters thoroughly enough to remember how and why they fit in or even exist.To give the book credit, I did finish it but this one will be one I donate to my local library.This book just didn't leave me with wanting more."
5,A winner; great if you drive around a lot,"This two tape case prepares you for the dating world (before and after) but a good 85% of it is about WHERE to meet women. Namely, where are the best places? And, where are the bad places to stay away from?Highlights include:(1) Why to consider personal ads; (2) great places for women to meet men so that there are lots of men and few women; (3) as #2 but for men; (4) dozens of innovative ideas that most people never consider; and (5) some really outlandish ideas; dozens of them; some even look like they might work; for instance, one woman admitted to driving around in a taxi and picking out interesting men; she'd act like they were going in the same direction and then the guy is pretty much there to talk with for a while.If you really want ideas though, check out his workbook: HOW TO BE OUTRAGEOUSLY SUCCESSFUL WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX. It's a misleading title but go with it."
5,If this doesn't get you the love of your life....,"This book is packed with total and complete common sense. It enlightens you and gives you amazing direction and advice. You'd have to be blind and running backwards not to meet anyone if you follow Paul's simple guidelines.Aside from anytning else, it is enjoyable and plain great fun!I would recommend this to anyone. It helps you build your own self-confidence and makes meeting an easy and approachable concept as opposed to a frightening experience.I hope you all gain as much pleasure from reading this as I did.Ivan Clements Producer Globomart Ltd UK"
2,"Blurry picture, poor sound.","This was unwatchable for me. Will get DVD later, as this is an excellent movie that I am fond of."
4,fuel pump review,form fit and function were a direct fit. A great part at an awesome price. Get back with me in a year or two as to durability.
5,It's minty!,"Minty, fresh and in a travel case. Don't use over-scented, average hotel soap. Take this with you."
5,excellent,a fresh look at this bloody century. clash of civilizations. nationalism. the causes of almost all the conflicts of the century.
3,A really interesting alternate take on contemporary history,"This book looks at the history of the twentieth century from an unusual perspective. I was really intrigued by the proposition that the third world war that we all feared would happen did, in fact, happen. It was the war in the third world, which is still raging."
5,Well worth the money!!!,"I purchased this carseat for my 5 month old son who had outgrown his infant car seat. I wanted the safest and yet easiest to use car seat available. I found it!! My son doesn't mind the side wings at all...he's not reclined too far so he's able to see his sister sitting next to him. He cried every time I put him in his old car seat...hasn't cried once in the Wizard! It's so comfy for him, I think! Thank you to all those who reviewed this car seat before I bought it...that was a major factor in getting my husband to let me spend the money. If I ever have any more children, they will start off in this carseat. There's nothing like peace of mind and a happy baby!"
2,My baby HATES this seat!,"I am a loyal Britax user. We have 3 Britax car seats. I purchased the Wizard for my 6 month old because of the ""improved side-impact protection"". While I am certain my child would be very protected in the event of a collision, we will never be able to see because he won't sit in the seat for more than 10 seconds. The headrest wraps completely around the sides of the head, which not only prevents movement, it prevents him from seeing anything that is not directly in front of him. So, he can't see out the car window. He is bored, and seems to feel completely trapped. I would definitely not recommend this car seat. Try the Marathon or Roundabout instead--they are great!"
4,Broken clamp,"I bought this car seat a year ago, and I have been very happy with it despite the recall on the restraint straps. This morning, while it was being moved from my Saturn to my husband's Chevy S-10, one of the red clamps used to hold the shoulder portion of a lap and shoulder belt while the seat is in a forward-facing position snapped off. Since I paid so much for this seat, I am a little disconcerted and disappointed that after only a year of use one of the parts that is supposed to guarantee my child's safety broke so easily. I am also a bit disappointed that I can only call them between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm M-Th, and between 8:30 am and 1:45 pm on Friday (all times EST, and I live in California!) I will add to this review after I finally get through to them."
4,Earthly Remains,"I enjoyed this book for its labyrinthine plot, despite several anachronisms it contains. I also believe that the writer could do a better job at getting inside the mind of his female characters. The reactions of his female protagonist seemed stilted in several places. Despite these criticisms, it was plot heavy with a strong and highly entertaining plotline and kept my interest piqued. It left me wondering at its conclusion just where the author got the idea for his intriguing storyline ..."
1,I was disappointed.,"Granted, the earrings were not expensive. However, I ordered them to go with an abalone pendent I purchased from another site. When they arrived in the mail, they were both broken. I never even took them out of the package. The little abalone stones had popped off of the silver mounts on both earrings. I will be able to buy some jewelers glue and glue them back on, but I shouldn't have to do that. Also, one of the sterling tear drop bases has a burr on it. It looks as though it should have been filed down, but was left on. As it turns out, I found a pair at Kohl's."
4,good,"They're very beautiful and were just what I expected. No problems with payment or shipping. The only problem I had was that the stone on one of the earrings fell off within five minutes of opening the box. It'll be easily glued back on, but it was embarrassing for me since I'd just given them to my mother as a gift."
2,Cheaper at Toys R Us site,"The musical North Pole Express was $21.99 on the Toys R Us website. It wasn't available in store, only online, I was surprised that it was so much less than Amazon. It's fun to watch the train, but should be considered more as holiday decor than as a toy that will stand up to children playing with it."
1,Disgusted,"This train arrived defective. I contacted Kurt Adler but they told me there was nothing they could do. I had to deal with Amazon.com with this frustration. The batteries are to be placed inside the train through the face on the front of the train. We are unable to unscrew the screw that holds the face on the train. Therefore, we cannot place the batteries inside the train and the train is not useable at this point. This was an item we wanted up and running for Christmas. We are disgusted.Musical North Pole Express Train Set"
1,No longer a shopper at Amazon,"I have shopped at Amazon for years and used ""one click"" feature frequently. Years ago, my kids received a North Pole Express Train as a gift and years later it stopped working. I was excited to find one online at Amazon and immediately purchased it using ""one click"" It was afterwards, beyond the 30 day returned period, that I discovered the toy I purchased from Amazon could be purchased at Target and elsewhere for nearly 80% less. An expensive lesson learned and Amazon has lost a customer for good.TJCarson City, Nevada"
2,A VERY small sampling of Tiffany works,"This book is incredibly tiny and thin (a quarter of an inch or so)--not at all like other books about Tiffany (such as those by John Loring et. al.). Half of the photos in the book aren't even of Tiffany jewels--they're things like movie stills and publicity photos for actors (there was one from ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" which, although trite. at least was relevant to the topic). Had I known I wouldn't have purchased it."
3,Short But Sweet,"A short, but sweet book about Tiffany's. I actually purchased the book as a decoration for my room, but I did read it and found the history of the company more interesting than anything else (unfortunately that's not what most of the book is about, a lot is about specific pieces of jewelry). Worth my money though!"
2,Common Sense,"Most of the information offered in this book is common sense. There is nothing in this book you couldn't find on the web by searching for ""interviewing tips"""
4,"short, but helpful","This is a fairly small, short book, but it's packed with lots of helpful information. It goes through what you should wear on your interview, how to behave with the receptionist or front desk person, what to bring with you, and other details that someone who's never had a job interview might need to know. My favorite part, though, was the list of possible questions the interviewer might ask. After going through most of them, I felt a lot more prepared, and the interviewer actually asked some of the ones I rehearsed. Not having read this book beforehand would have been like not having studied for a test--I might have known some of the answers, but certainly not as many and not as well. So...read this book!"
2,This is a cheap remake,"I have owned the original version of this truck for years, and all my grandchildren love it. That is why I was willing to pay the very high price for this truck. The pictures and description were for the original version that I own, but the truck that arrived was a cheap remake. The rubber tires that were in the description turned out to be cheap plastic, and the rumbling sound when the wheels roll was gone. What a disappointment! I bought a different truck to give to my grandson for Christmas."
2,Great Toy to look at,My 2 1/2 year old got this for Christmas. He has played with it one time in 2 months. I pull it out and try to get him interested in it but just goes for his other toys. Once the weather becomes nice we will put in the sandbox and hopefully he will play with it then.
2,"Needless, disappointing add-on","Already with the Sega CD as an available add-on for the Genesis, and with the 32-bit era around the corner, Sega released the 32X; a cartridge based add-on that promised 32-bit play on a 16-bit system. When you pop it into your Genesis along with a 32X game, you'll notice that many of these supposed 32-bit games look only a step above 16-bit. What killed the 32X, much like what killed the Sega CD, was the lack of quality games released for the system. The only game I can recall that was excellent for the 32X was Sega's World Series Baseball, and after that everything else is pretty much avaerage. Third party support was almost non-existant except from Acclaim, but for those who first heard about this add-on before it was released, it was pretty much known that the 32X was doomed from the start. Below is a list of the best games available for the 32X:World Series BaseballVirtua FighterStar Wars ArcadeDoomMortal Kombat 2Knuckles ChaotixPitfall: The Mayan Adventure"
2,Does not work on Sega Genesis 3 Core system,"Not compatible with my system and it did not specify that in the description. Unless I missed something, I did not see a comment in the description saying it had to be used only with Sega Genesis 2"
2,32X murdered Genny,I'll be the first to admit I love Sega CD but 32X was bad from the get go. Becuse Sega Saturn was released about 5 6 months after the 32X it would be like Sony making an add on for PS2 6 months before Playstion 3 would be set to come out. The only reason to get this terrible add on is for MK2 but then again SNES was a good port 32X version was the best next to the arcade. Sega CD I recommend but 32X pick it up at your local sewer for a quarter cause that's where it belongs. But hey it's a lot better than Nintendo's Virtual boy.
1,Don't Buy!,"This thing sucked back then, it sucks now. It's not even worth 10 bucks. There's only like 3 good games for the thing....."
4,a great teriffic system but not exactly 5 stars,"this system is great, my first 32 bit system!but there are some flaws like all the required chords used to make it work. how ever it is backwards compatible with all genesis games and has a few absolute gems on the system stuff likeB.C. racers (fun fun FUN!)DooM (one of my all time favorite shooters)star wars arcadeprimal rage(if getting a massive gorilla and peeing your foe to death isn't fun...what is?)knuckles chaotix (an absolute must have!)mortal kombat 2 (graphics are pretty neat)what are you waiting for nintendo to make one?"
1,Piece of garbage,"This was a piece of total garbage and a horrid looking tumor for the Sega Genisis. The piece of crap requires it's own large Ac adapter etc just like the Genisis, it had crappy games, and had a history of breaking genisis games. This is laughable to look at and this and Sega cd added nothing to the genisis system, but it was a worthy try to match nintendo."
1,This is a First thing ripoff,"First thing, this DVD would not run on any of my DVD players. I then put the DVD in my laptop and it wouldn't run in that, so I tried my desktop. After some messing around in the D drive on my computer I got it to run. It was a program called Gardiner's World hosted by Phillip Gardiner a known Masonic critic. The entire video was Phillip Gardiner interviewing two different experts something akin to a talk show. It really was a very bad film and I recommend it to those out there who are insomniacs. Who knows, there may have been another program on the DVD but as I mentioned, it would not play. I tried 3 seperate DVD players plus my computers."
5,"Fascinating, Informative & Truly Revealing...","A fascinating DVD revealing the true origins of this secret society......Dr David Harrison author of the thoroughly researched book 'The Genesis of Freemasonry' now shares his knowledge in this informative film. Talking about the alchemy, necromancy & the mysteries surrounding this intriguing brotherhood Dr David Harrison presents hard evidence to back up his conclusions.If, like me you found 'The Genesis of Freemasonry' a truly fascinating read then I fully recommend 'The Origins of Freemasonry: Where Did It All Begin'. I award this DVD the full 5 stars!!!'The Genesis of Freemasonry' is also available to buy on Amazon:Genesis of Freemasonry"
1,worthless,This is nothing but glorified white water. The only way this would kill a mouse would be if it fell in the bottle and drown. Waste of money. Waste of time using it. My husband and I sprayed this in the face of a mouse and all around it. What a joke! The mouse was running all around. It is a rat's race and this mouse won. The mouse lived to tell the story to his family. I would not recommend this for a serious way to get rid of mice. I only gave it one star because it would not take the review without it.
2,Doesn't work,"We tried spraying this everywhere in the kitchen where we have a mice infestation. They didn't go anywhere, but they did continue to get caught in the old-fashioned snap trap."
4,Thorough Review,"Unlike some of the other opinions that have been written regarding this book, I found it highly useful and would certainly recommend it to anyone who does not just want bare memorization material for an exam, but truly desires to learn about Micosoft security.I have three MCSE's, and I have just obtained my MCSE: Security on Server 2003; and, I will keep this book for continued professional reference."
1,Horrible Book,"Usually, i really like the training books of MSPress for Windows Server 2003 - But this one is an exeption.The Problem with this book was, after i read a chapter, i knew exactly as much as before. This is not because i am a security-guru (really i'm not) , it is because of the bad writing style. Sometimes it isn't really clear what the writer wants to say with the lessons and if he takes the reader serious.Another Problem with this book, it is full of so called ""considerations"" and ""guidelines"" instead of a serious, stong security training (most of them are really useless because they are so obvious that you know those even without the book).I strongly recommend to do not use this Book for 70-298 Training, even if you are a fan of the MSPress series. It's not worth the money."
1,"I bought all the MS Press Books for self-study, but this....","To all, this is my last exam for MCSE status. I purchased all the Microsoft Press books as preparation and coupled with my experience, it has sufficed.I did complete reading this book, however this book is poorly written. The author spends a entire chapters speaking in generalities and leaves how to design security and remediate security risks to your own judgment.Wait, I take some of that back. The author does use some specification in the book and refers to all administrators, users and clients as female. Not that it matters, but I prefer the past books where they were androgynous.Since this is my last exam I purchased other materials. I highly recommend purchasing CBT Nugget videos as it thoroughly explains security design and it's implementation."
5,"A ""Must-HAVE"" for MCSE Certification",MCSE Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-298): Designing Security for a Microsoft Windows Server(TM) 2003 Network (Training Kit)This is the ultimate resource for training for your certification and for reference after you are certified. I recommend this to all those who want to understand the complex process of designing network security.
1,Horrible Book,"This book does an atrocious job of preparing you for the 70-298 exam. There are entire topics missing and tons of wordy fluff that seem intended to merely fill pages and make this book heavy. It's practicaly worthless as an exam prep tool. Besides that, it's absolutely boring. I guarantee you won't make it past the first two chapters without snoozing. You're much better off merely browsing Microsoft TechNet for free."
1,Horrible,Of the thousands of pages read preparing for one certification for another --- this is the worst book I have come across. Frankly I am so disapointed I may well not purchase another book from this publisher.I am half way throught the 2nd section. I see no reason to continue...
2,Deja Vu,"Very repetative. Chapter after Chapter, the same thing, analyze ... determine ... design ... analyze ... determine ... design ... I'm feeling an overwelming sense of deja vu...Very repetative. Chapter after Chapter, the same thing, analyze ... determine ... design ... analyze ... determine ... design ... I'm feeling an overwelming sense of deja vu...However, it is a good reminder of checklists for the processes...However, it is a good reminder of checklists for the processes..."
3,Why not ALT,I suppose this is a good book. Typical Microsoft white paper with discussion related only to MS.I've opted to take the CompTIA Security+ certification exam instead (it can be used in place of 70-298).
4,Good tool for writers,this is a good book for people who need training on fiction writing. I didn't give it a five because it requires the reader to read a number of books while also studying/reading this one. It's more of a class than a book so I'd suggest that anyone buying this book also purchase the books recommended beforehand.
2,few techniques many examples,"I am not writing in English and try to learn some fiction writing skills. This book has cited many literay fiction and is a good source for you to find fictions good at dialogue, etc. But it provides very few techniques and you have to read the referred literature to know how to write a dialogue. I jumped many paragraphs. I also can not agree with the author on what attract the readers. Sometimes I feel the opposite about certain classics. Other books I am reading provide me with many techniques such as Techniques of Selling Writer and Immediate Fiction."
3,It's OK,I often have skin irritation after shaving and I had high hopes for this balm. It helped with the irritation but not to the degree I expected.
5,"Fantastic, soothing after shave","This is a great aftershave. I have been using it for over a year now. I tried some others and found this to be the best for me. Very light, soothing, and moisturizing without being greasy or heavy. Absorbs well, leaves skin feeling great all day."
2,"Improved formula, MUCH stronger scent!","Nivea is renown for creating super facial products. This ""new improved"" formula is loaded with a heavy scent that the previous product did without.It's unfortunate that products groomed for sensitive skins are becoming increasing fragrant. Overpowering. Simply cannot use this newest formula."
5,Can't live without it,I love this stuff! I used to use a variety of other after shaves but I love Nivea. My skin in quite sensitve so using Nivea signficantly reduced irritation from shaving. It's great as a balm works so much better than the thinner lotions (water like ones).
4,Works very well,"A 4 pak will last me several years however the product is very good. Gentle, not greasy and it has a pleasant smell. I would recommend it for all sensitive faces."
5,One of the best,"In a small undistinguished town,where everyone know everyone in one way or another, and nothing is ever forgotten, the lifes of several people are about to change.The descriptions are perfect and you find yourself sympathizing with all the characters, understanding their point of view.During one week the lifes of everyone will come to a U turn, and at the end of the week, you are filled with a feeling of pain and gentle beauty and even if the ending doesn't exceed the possible (and, perhaps, because of that) it seems that the remainder of characters' life will be different.A truly great book that will at first spellbind you to it and will leave you thinking after you will finish it."
1,Book is fantastic. This print is unreadable.,This is a photocopy of an older version of this book. At times the contrast is too high so the letters bleed together. Buy the Sovereign Grace publication instead.
1,Over rated CD,I thought I was listening to a high school band as opposed to a frst class orchestra. The quality of sound reproduction was poor arrangement choppy.
2,title of review,"I don't get this rock n roll hardcore stuff, it's just not heavy or abrasive enough to have any impact, and it's not catchy either. The vocals are so frantic and impassioned, but the music is just wussy and dull."
1,ACDC on speed.,This music is not worth it. IF you enjoy bar music with a bit of singing and a bit of screaming then this is for you. It also has a sound of Marilyn Manson to some of it. Not so shock rock though.
5,the Mozart is indispensable,"Szell's Divertimemto K131 had been difficult to acquire, unlike his symphony 33. Both performances are superb. I once heard Szell and Cleveland on tour in Boston play k131 1 1/2 times b/c they repeated the first three or four movements post late seating. This piece contains frequent solo horn choirs and was played perfectly (also on the program: Schumann #1 and Prokofiev PC #3 w/ Gina Bachauer.) On CD there is also an excellent k131 w/Marriner/ASMF, but I am thrilled by this Szell version. I prefer this Curzon Emperor to two of his later versions (w/ Knappertsbusch and Boulez). It is tighter and tougher. However, I prefer others: Casadesus/Rosbaud/RCO (mainly for the incredible Rosbaud), Fleisher/Szell, Brendel/Levine, Serkin/Ormandy."
1,the big sky,"the two VHS taps t bought from two different companies, the cover jacket said in magnificent black and white; they was not in B/W they was the colorized versions and had 10-15 min. cut from the original version, you can't go by what is on the out side. i was very disappointed with them.paul l johnson"
5,movie evaluation,"To each his own. I like movies about early American life which makes an attempt to show life as it was then. The story is interesting but not overly believable concerning the Indian girl being the daughter of an Indian chief ... but you get the feel of life as it was then. We must remember, without some story of interest, who would buy the video. I had seen this on TCM and wanted my own copy to give to my grandchildren."
2,The Big Studio,"That's what they might have called this film, directed by the great Howard Hawks, but a poor job nonetheless. There is scarcely a single believable scene, just contrived rivalries between trading scows and upset Injuns during a Missouri River run in the early 19th century. More than half the action takes place at night but apparently Hawks had a phobia about night-shooting outdoors, and the sets are lousy. If he had tried day-for-night it would have added to the realism and made a little better film."
5,Being Responsible can be Fun !,"I am in awe of how Marc Brown has simplified the concept of responsibility, so that it may beunderstood by my two year old daughter.My two year old daughter summed this book up by saying; "" Arthur showed his mommy and daddy he can take care of everyone's pets now he can have Pal . In my eyes that says it all !The author has sucessfully done what was intended . He communicated an important moral concept to a small child , what being responsible is and how doing things morally right can be fun and rewarding.Keep up the good work Marc Brown you are helping me communicate important moral, social, family, and educational values to my daughter.Great Books and Characters"
5,Jump Start your Life!,"I was attracted to this book by the phrase ""waking up from the sleep walking mode"", as it struck a chord in me. Working 9 to 5, living for weekends and vacations just seems like sleep walking... at least to me. Siva's approach to ""waking up"" is simple, direct, honest and practical. It has given me a more clarified sense of purpose and meaning. I wish I would have read it 20 years ago! I would recommend it for everyone!"
4,Alright!,Go Busta! You will be receiving a couple of awards next year and will definitely be singing a song of salvation. You went all out! Congratulations!
1,What is he thinking?,"What he did to iron man is unacceptable.ANYBODY else could have done better, maybe it is just because he is a rapper, and as we all know, rapping takes no talent."
4,Business analysis procedures for Open Source,"This book provides analytical tools for evaluating the use of open source tools in a business context. There is no source code. No particular advocacy of any language or toolkit. This is a business book that has a positive perspective about open source, but it more about how to evaluate open source software and how it can be deployed effectively.On the downside, the text and the topic are fairly dry, and the insistence on putting paragraph synopsis lines next to ever single paragraph in the entire book is annoying. The synopsis lines should summarize and entire page or set of paragraphs.It's not a book for everyone. This is a book for CTOs and product managers. If you are having trouble convincing your employers or employees about the business value and quality of open source alternatives to commercial products you should have a look at this book."
5,Excellant DVD and CD of Hendrix,"Live at Woodstock is Well made, There is only one Problem, It is too Good, You realise that Jimmy was So Young when he died,The DVD Brings him to Life, as compared to his Mythical Music.It is also well made Memorial to Historic Woodstock.I have a Tape of Woodstock, and you can not compare!"
2,Almost funny.,"This book tries to be amusing. It ranges from the absurd ""eating oatmeal with your hands"" to the illegally outrageous suggestion to report a single neighbor for wife-beating. Very UN-amusing.There are better ways to spend your time. This book could have been condensed into one of those annoying emails that always manage to be forwarded to you. You know the kind of email that you skim and immediately delete? Well, that's what this book is like.Sorry. Not recommended."
2,Don't put $1500 worth of pies into a $60 bag.,"Personally, I wouldn't have bought this bag had I known that there are no felt dividers inside to separate the cymbals and keep them from rubbing metal-on-metal."
4,GREAT TO WATCH THE LESSONS AREN'T FOR BEGINNERS,"I have seen Tommy live a couple of times and I have just about everything he has put out. He always comes across as being very passionate about the guitar. He has a great sence of humour and is fun to watch. I'd say this DVD is for those at a fairly advanced playing level but one that anyone who is appreciates watching one of the worlds best guitarists at work would enjoy. If you're looking for more basic instruction check out his ""up close"" and ""guitar talk"" DVD's.Jim"
3,"Great music, Fair Instruction","The DVD itself has within complete songs and rough break down of the methodology and techique. Camera shots could be better. BUT the major problem is the lack of written tabs and/or standard music.I know Tommy doesn't read much and certainly doesn't 'write' music, but someone could come up with tabs which would be a tremendous help and bring my rating to a 4 or better.Thanks anyway Tommy. Still a very good effort, but not for the guitarist that wants to learn from an intermediate standpoint. He does show you some tricks and some technique which anyone can incorporate into their playing.GREG GUITARS LLCSouthport, NC 910-457-9145"
4,if the dolls talked kind of view....,"Lets say that ken and blaine was both at the studio, sitting there being interviewed about their social lives and such....for say "" blaine "" it was written on a box about him supposingto be barbie's brother, and that blaine likes one of her friendsand barbie is still with ken, and yes barbie and ken got marriedhello...there are be wedded dolls like those two out there...and all this talk about who's who...they'll go crazy and fled the country...silently as we all sleep."
5,Travel stick,"I received this product very quickly. It does the job for me. I have issueswith ligaments from my hip to knee, outside of leg. My chiropractor recommendedthis product. It has helped me, however, I need to keep using it. The stickhas perfect amount of flexibility---it's very durable"
5,The best little touture device physical therapy never showed me!,"After hearing about ""the stick"" in PT (but never having tried it) once discharged I opted to purchase one for myself to continue to keep my body healing and releive pain and it does that and so much more. It gives you a sense of independence when you can get to areas that you would normally avoid, pay someone to stimulate, or worse; continue to be in pain by doing nothing! I highly recommend this product as its very useful, easy to use and a great tool. Best to buy it in conjunction with a durable Foam Roller it is useful for getting into spots the foam roller can't in a toally different self-guided process that you control 100%"
3,"Works as advertised, but smells bad...","As a runner, I'm always sore. This stick does a good job of smoothing out the achy and stiff areas and seems to help me recover quicker. The size is great (I haul it in my backpack to work). My only criticism (as others have pointed out) is the handle smell. I've tried cleaning it, airing it out, nothing works. The smell gets on your hands when you use it so I always have to wash after. Makes my wife nauseous."
5,Excellent,"This thing is amazing. I don't use it for any other part of the body other than the legs. It's the perfect size.Only problem I have (which is my fault) is that I wish I bought the sprinter stick. The traveler has some flexibility to it. But considering that I press as hard as possible because I love a deep massage, it still is all good. I love it painful. It doesn't seem like it will break, but I'm pretty sure I'm maxing this bend in it.So if you really wanna mash your legs after a heavy squat day, get the firmer sprinter stick."
5,"Bought for my husband, but I sneak it back often!","""Santa"" placed this gem in my husbands stocking and we both love it. I originally was introduced to this product at The Rock n Roll Marathon expo in St Louis and knew we had too have one. My husband can massage his shoulders and upper back by himself with ease when I'm not around, and I can give him really good totally body massages with this with very little effort. I am a runner and often suffer from leg and foot cramps, but since using this product after a run and before bed have them very infrequently anymore. Such a blessing for my muscles as well!"
5,Works as advertised,"A friend recently told me about the travel stick during a ski trip and, also being a runner, I was interested in finding an easy-to-use device that would massage sore muscles and help in the process of getting rid of lactic acid that builds up during exercise.The travel stick is easy to use and works well to massage sore quads either from active downhill skiing or after long runs. The stick isn'trocket science but I feel it helps a lot with easing muscle discomfort."
5,The Stick That Works,"The Stick works well for me. I use it after all bike rides. My quads, hamstings and calf muscles feel great after using The Stick. It eliminates the soreness and tightness I used to feel a few hours after the ride."
4,It works well.,It is good and does work. But you it takes one day after you use it for the knots or pain to go away. It looks good and is worth the money. I do not regret my purchase. It is better than other massaging tools i have used.
5,This thing rocks!,"I can't beleive I didn't buy this years ago. It's excellent for working out legs, buttocks, arches of your feet, etc. Love, love, love it. Worth the price."
4,works,"this smaller stick works well, but is a bit short. I know the length is clearly detailed in the description, but somehow it is just a bit too short to work perfectly. hence minus one star."
5,Fantastic!,"Before college, I had never heard of a ""Running Stick"". By the end of my freshman cross country season, I don't know how I've managed to live without one. Convenient, reliable, and affordable!"
5,Magic stick,"I have seen booths where they were hawking these and stayed away. After pulling my calf muscle during a run my niece had me try her Marathon stick. It worked fantastic. I picked up the travel stick and use it after every bike ride. I brought it in to work and a couple co-workers liked it so much they also bought it.(she uses it on her daughter for growing pains) Seems strange to pay $30 for a plastic stick but hey, it works!"
4,FYI- This is the Travel Stick (smaller),"I didn't do enough research. This is the Travel stick (deemed the 2nd smallest of the sticks from the stick dot com). Works great for legs, arms, etc. but a bit too short for back, shoulders."
5,RUB YOUR SORENESS AWAY.............,"THIS ITEM HAS HELPED WITH THE CONTINUED PAIN IN MY LEFT HIP AND MY LEFT LEG. SURPRISINGLY, IT REALLY HELPS BECAUSE MY SKIN HURTS IF YOU PRESS TOO HARD. CONTROLLING YOUR OWN PRESSURE POINTS, CONTROLS THE PAIN SO IT IS BEARABLE. GREAT ITEM.........."
4,A good product for runners,"At first glance it looks worthy 5-10 $ at most. Despite its appearance, it is actually effective.Using it before and after running exercise, warms up muscle and release pain.Cured my leg muscle pulling after several times usage.Good product for runners."
4,WOW am i glad i read this on my kindle,IF YOU WANT TO MASSAGE SORE MUSCLES THIS IS THE PERFECT THING I STICK IT IN MY SUITCASE WHEN TRAVELING AND IT CERTAINLY COMES IN VERY HANDY MY TRAINER RECOMMENDED IT AND I THANK HIM OFTEN BECASUE OF IT
3,That plastic is cold!,"This stick does what it is supposed to, but I would advise not storing it on the floor in the winter. Maybe tucking it in bed with you is the solution. Those hard plastic rings are really cold on your tight morning muscles."
3,King,"I was pleased with the product. However, I asked to have the item canceled so I could resubmit with the correct address. Someone wrote me back and said there was no order place for me. However, a few days later the funds were taken from my account. As well as the product came to my old address even after I informed them I moved. Overall it was not a bad experience and now I have my product.Happy and satisfied customerKing"
4,"Works well, could use an extra half size cell","The product works, I just wish they'd put a half size cell in so that the cells don't roll side to side so often."
4,Leg pain- GONE,"I run a ton and when I get a muscle cramp in my leg this helps work it out. Just make sure to push lighter. While really working it out can seem like a good idea, it often makes the muscle hurt even more."
5,Perfect Solution to Sore Muscles,"After getting more serious about running, I found myself with cramps and aches. This was an easy way to work out some of the knots from sore muscles."
4,Great,The stick works great exactly what I was looking for! Great substitute for a foam roller and very easy to travel with.
5,Travel stick,"Bought from a recommendation of a friend who's been using it for years. Now I see why. Recent injury needed deep massaging & the stick worked great for it. All runners& bikers should own one. Works as good as my Compex unit in some instances, but slot quicker."
5,Life Saver,I am amazed on how well this works! It is a MIRACLE worker. So worth the money. The travel stick is the right size to go anywhere. I bring it with me to dance class and just anywhere I want. I love it soo much!
2,Too Much Flex,"I own the original ""Stick"" and bought this one specifically for traveling. Way too much flex for anyone who wants to get deep myofascial release. They do offer a ""stiff"" stick but at a ludicrous price of $48, I'll pass. Oh well..."
4,stick review,The product is as promised & husband enjoys after long bike rides. Although I was charged for insufficient postage and did attempt to contact seller to resolve to no avail. Disappointed I was charged for their error.
4,Nice to have,"Have run multiple marathons and this massage stick helps me workout the ""kinks"" in some of my tendons which get a little tight. Limiting factor is hard for a person to push hard enough themselves for the purpose above. A well known runner in Austin actually used this product on me when I started having problems which prompted me to buy - he knew the pressure point and how to hit it which actually almost brought me to my knees (couldn't believe I was that tight). I do use this along side my roller to stay injury free."
2,...Whatever...,"""Charlie Bone and the Invisible Boy"" is the third book in a series about a boy with a gift that he was born with, but doesn't know about until he is older. His father died 'mysteriously' when he was a baby. When the boy's evil aunts find out that he has a gift, they ship him off to a big boarding school named Hogwarts - - oops, I mean Bloor's Academy.Plot sounds pretty familiar, eh? That's because it's a watered-down version of Harry Potter with a little bit of extras added in there, just to make it seem different. BUT IT HASN'T FOOLED ME!!! Nimmo has an annoying way of revealing everything before you're supposed to know. I easily predicted what was going to happen at the end before I was even halfway through the book!!! It's the same with all of Nimmo's books, and I would advise Nimmo to either alter her style a lot, or just GIVE UP."
5,Better than HP,"I read The Invisible Boy after I'd finished the first two in the series, and I'm hooked. People keep comparing Charlie Bone books with Harry Potter, but they're not that similar. Harry Potter is more about magic (which after a point gets unbelieveably complicated), while Charlie Bone has better character development and person-to-person interaction. Charlie also isn't so resentful and authority-testing, and he's more person than magician."
5,Run? It's Belll !!,"The book controlled me not me controlling the book. Each page made the book more suspenceful with them worrying about Ollie and keeping an eye on Yolanda (Belle). I especially loved how in the middle of the book when the characters thought it couldn't get worse, Skarpo comes and makes thing get more exciting."
4,"Good, but slightly generic","This book has an interesting plotline, and the characters are believable (well, mostly), but the 'kids-who-have-magic-powers-and-are-sent-to-boarding-school' thing is really generic. All in all, a good book, but not my favorite."
5,A Very Good Fantasy Book!,"Charlie and the Invisible Boy by Jenny Nimmo is about a boy named Charlie and his friends who go to a school and have magical powers. One day his uncle (who he looks up to) comes home all torn up. Meanwhile a mysterious new school girl comes over to his house. Charlie and his friends discover that there was an invisible boy living in the school. This is a great book for people who enjoy fantasy and a good plot. This book is full of surprises and the author kept most of them a secret until the end! Don't get discouraged if you find the book a bit boring at the beginning! It will help a lot, probably, if you would have read the earlier two books in the series because lots of it was about information that you will most likely find in the earlier books. I never read them but it probably would have helped me understand things better. Have fun reading!"
4,"When Charlie Bone Gets Older, He Aspires To Be Harry Potter","Call me a sheep. I'm as big a fan as the next kid of Harry Potter on the edge of my seat awaiting each new installment. So while I'm waiting, it was good to find Jenny Nimmo's Charlie Bone and the Invisible Boy.Another boy going to another school not solely comprised of wizards, but with enough of them to make it seem so. While the series may seem clone-like, I still think it's fantastic for the slightly younger wizard in your household. They're much easier to read with simpler story lines, but still have enough pull to keep the youngster enthralled.This is the third book in the series which also includes Midnight for Charlie Bone and Charlie Bone and the Time Twister."
4,Charlie Bone and the Invisible Boy,"My grandkids absolutely love this set. Being able to read someone elses mind can be awesome but it comes with a price. At times thatThe Charlie Bone Children of the Red King Collection (Children of the Red King Series-Books 1 through 4, I through IV)price is very scary."
4,charlie bone,chalie bone and the time twister is a pretty good book. i would recomend it if you like some sort of fantasy and suspence. there are lots of difrent things going on at once in some parts of the storrie.
5,A wonderful Read. Cheers it Jenny Nemo.,"Charlie Bone and the Invisible Boy Book ReviewJenny Nemo has finally done it. This latest book in the Charlie Bone series is wonderfully imaginative. Charlie's evil relatives, who make Harry Potter's aunt and uncle look like saints, are up to no good again. The school that he goes to is full of nasty characters ready to make his life and his friends a living hell and to make matters worse there is a strange visitor to his school that his wicked aunts approve of. This semester is not easy for Charlie but he and his friends strive to save the innocent victims that have been sucked into the school's evil web, while trying not to get caught up in it himself. A wonderful read.Caterina Christakos"
4,"Zep has so many hits, some had to be excluded.","I'm a BIG Led Zeppelin fan and the songs on this album are all worthy Zeppelin hits. No one buying this album should be disappointed because the songs are all great and they sound much better now that they're remastered. The only thing is that Led Zeppelin had so many good songs on their albums, it is impossible to include them all on one cd. Why are there only 2 songs from the 2nd and 3rd albums? Why were songs like Heartbreaker, The Lemon Song and Celebration Day left off? If you want the full Led Zeppelin experience, buy the original albums (the 4 cd box set is good too). If you're only looking for a taste of some of Led Zeppelin's best earlier work, this is a great album. By the way, if you're getting this for Stairway To Heaven alone, you'll be surprised that Led Zeppelin's other songs are great too and sometimes better."
5,Great!!,I got this cd for a Birthday present and it was a Hit !! My little brother still thanking me for it.
1,Redundant Indeed,"I agree that this release was completely pointless... I guess I bought it for the cool looking photo on the front and that's about it. At least when I bought the Complete Studio Recordings I could justify owning two copies of every album because the CSR tracks were remastered and did sound slightly better. But, with no remixes, no remasters, and nothing new, I don't know why they put this record out; I think we can all agree the release of the Royal Albert Hall '70 or Earls Court '75, or Seattle '77 or ... etc. would have been much better. Page et al need to get their act together and release more live material."
4,YOUR UNCLE USED TO LISTEN TO THIS,"Ideal for youngsters of today who want to know what their uncle used to listen to for kicks.Can't beleive i wrote this but i did. Nowadays, we compress everything ,so why not LED ZEP 1-2-3-4 in one cd?Only HEARTBREAKER is missing, but it has not aged so well ,so they cut it.DAZED AND CONFUSED was always vintage ZEP, and the same can be said of WHOLE LOTTA LOVE and STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN.The first album was always the best for me ,even if 4 is the most celebrated.It's interesting to buy THE JEFF BECK GROUP's two albums with ROD STEWART ,many blues show the same influence.It's also compress in 1cd, and has a nice booklet so!"
4,Good for a fix or flashback,"If you already own most of their stuff in digital format, good for you and dont bother posting comments about the content of this disc or complaints about yet another reissue to make money, etc etc. However, for those of us old timers who grew up with these guys and had their whole catalog on vinyl and/or 8 track but never got around to buying it again due to things like life and family, this kind of disc is perfect to buy and pop in for the occasional led zep fix and/or flashback. Looking forward to another in this series covering the later days."
3,"Ok album, Missing many hit songs",I'm going to keep this review short. Led Zeppelin had many more hits then these songs in the early days. Its missing great songs such as black mountain side and moby dick. I hope to see better greatest hits albums in the future.
4,Early Days: Has it all! well almost,"This single CD is a compliment to anyones collection. With songs such as Black Dog, Dazed and Confused, and the well-known Stairway to Heaven. Just toss it in your player and you get over an hour of pure Led Zeppelin. However it is lacking some of the deeper tracks which happen to be my favorite. I have all of the released Zeppelin albums, but lately I've been using this CD more. Its just so easy to toss it in and get a variaty of their sound. My opinion is that if you're a hardcore Zeppelin fan like myself than you will love it. Lets just hope Volume two is on its way."
1,Where is II,there are lots of songs they have missed from that album that are constiered classicsthank youheartbreakerliving loving maid (she's just a woman)ramble onall get played many times but is not on this album avoid at all costs and just get the albums individualy
2,"Get the ""Remasters"", instead","they have good selections from the ZOSO album, but the rest,WHERE'S ""RAMBLE ON""? I would replace ""What is...."" with ""Ramble On"" and put at least one more track from ""lll"" like ""Gallow's Pole"". Just stick with that ""Remasters"" set and ditch the ""interviews"" disc and there U have it."
4,"WHERE'S ""RAMBLE ON"" ?","Have the first four albums on vinyl (in my opinion they went downhill from there) and was looking for a CD that comprised these early works. That's exactly what this is, a compilation of the first four album, but didn't purchase it because ""Ramble On"" was not included! If you have the extra bucks, you're probably better off buying the first four remastered CD's."
2,Why?Why?Why? Why?,"Is it the band, or the record label that can't get enough cash? Don't get me wrong, the music on this disc is incredible, but the disc itself is completely pointless. Everything Zeppelin recorded was good, and each original album stands alone. There's already 2 boxed sets and a 2 disc greatest hits set (Remasters) and now this waste. So I guess Christmas 2000 we'll get the same material wrapped in different packaging so the fans can get ripped off some more. How about a release of some live material we don't already own, we know it's out there Jimmy!"
1,Don't you feel robbed?,"How many more repackaged ""Best of"" CDs will Led Zeppelin release? The music is incredible, but why treat their fans as brainless cattle? That's why many people turned to alternative & punk - because of this shameless rip off of fans' money. Please read ""Hammer of the Gods"" to discover the real Led Zeppelin."
2,pointless release,"Jimmy Page and Atlantic have no purpose releasing this record. This goes against the belief that Zeppelin is an ""albums only"" band. Plus the selection of songs put on this record is very questionable.I mean 5 out of the thirteen songs are from the fourth album, which is rediculous. Where are such hits like Heartbreaker and Celebration Day? It is impossible to make a greatest hits album for Zeppelin because all eight of the studio albums are greatest hits of their own. If u want to listen to Zeppelin I recommend that you buy every album and not waste your money on this cd.What Jimmy needs to do is release some more live stuff instead of a waste of time release like this one."
1,the same materials like in the remastered album,The same songs like in the remastered album. is it not a Superfluous songs Buddy? Think about it before you buy this!
5,Performs Concise & Valuable Service,"This needed to be done, and was done well. Vol. 2 will be welcom"
1,was I a fool guy to buyin this one??,"many reviewers said that they are dissappointed buying this compilation, they already had from the original LP`S. I cannot understand why Jimmy page had released this one again on the same set? the set is not a new one! the songs already had been released in the original albums. if u think my review is not usefull, u dont need to answer it ok?"
2,Zeppelin a greatest hits group?,"I listened to this CD and yes there are great songs on it, but seriously Led Zeppelin is not a greatest hits group (see Lenny Kravitz). The only way to get the best of Zeppelin is to at least buy the 4 disc box set or all their albums. Please do not consider this their greatest hits!"
1,why?,"Led Zeppelin is probably my favorite bands and this recording infuriates me! Of course, the kiddies will go for this one to try to be cool, but what experienced Zep Head would buy this junk if one owns the original albums? This is garbage. Why doesn't Zep re-group with john paul jones so that we can get a NEW album"
3,Original albums are better,"Taken as it is, there is plenty of great music on this collection. You've got ""Communication Breakdown"", ""Whole Lotta Love"" ""Black Dog"" and more. The only problem is that you miss out on those tracks that weren't included. Led Zeppelin specialized in making great albums from start to finish and merely selecting a few favorites off of each doesn't do justice to their musical range."
5,This one of my favorite CD's,It was so fun listening to all of my favorite songs on one Cd. I recomend this CD to everyone.
1,Buy the original releases,"The real ""early days"" is every track on Zep's first four lps. Of course, every song (almost) on every Zep album is essential, so why waste your time with this? Every Zep album is important (well maybe ""Coda"" is stretching it), so there is no need for this. If you are curious about Led Zep and need an intro, start with ""Good Times, Bad Times"" and go from there. Amen."
4,Good Highlight of First Four Albums - Excellent Bonus,"This album has good highlights of the first four albums. II could have contributed more songs and IV a few less. It is a good CD for the casual Led Zeppelin listener. The CD include a video track of ""Communication Breakdown"" if played on a computer with Quicktime loaded."
1,You can't do this to Zeppelin,"Why? Why do this to probably the greatest rock and roll band ever? I can't think of a bad Zeppelin song and to just take a bunch of their tunes and mush them together isn't right. If you want to experience Zeppelin then put down a little more money and buy the full albums, i know you won't regret it, especially Led Zeppelin II, that's the one i'd say you'd wanna go for first, it's got a little bit of everything, from hard rock of whole lotta love and heartbreaker to the more heartfilled Thank You to the bluesy Lemon Song."
2,why again??,"why again? the fans have already bought the original albums in the seventies and eighties. We have the remastered double cd set, and what does this new released mean? there are no new songs in this compilation album! I think plant and Page needed money for their tax or revenue office."
2,I agree with another reviewer from Wiesbaden germany!,"Well I agree with that fellow from Wiesbaden below. I will be fooling my self if I'm having the songs I already bought on the original LP's before. This old band had been died in 1981, but the ex members of the band still need money more than you thought! I guess Jimmy Page and Plant are feeling the same! there aren't something new on this cd, it is a great compilation for die hard fans only!"
2,Many glaring omissions,"Should have been included, but were not:Heartbreaker (Zep's best song! Why did they leave this out?)You Shook MeYour Time Is Gonna ComeI Can't Quit You BabyGoing To CaliforniaThe Lemon SongOut On The TilesBron-Y-Aur-StompGallows PoleThank YouCelebration DayDon't bother with this. Buy Zeppelin's albums instead."
3,"All Great Songs, But Not Enough","This was the first Led Zeppelin CD I bought after I heard some of their music elsewhere and really liked it. After buying this CD and listening to it, I was very satisfied... for a while. I didn't have much knowledge (I really didn't have any) of Led Zeppelin at the time. Then I found out more about them and the very wide range of music they play. I have also listened to other songs of theirs and they are great. It is also a well-known belief that Led Zeppelin are the kings of album rock. I, myself, am thinking about buying a virtually complete box set of Led Zeppelin's music. The only reason I even gave this CD 3 stars is because the songs are great, and it might be a good introduction, but, if you're like me, you'll probably want a lot of their other albums or the box set, which will have all of these songs anyway."
2,Worthless....,"Don't be a cheapo, buy the original albums! If you buy only this CD you're missing out on sooooo much. The real 'Best of Led Zeppelin' collection is the Complete Studio Recordings box set. I give this more than one star only because the songs are so damn good."
2,Before you want to buy this...,"Before you want to buy this, ask questions to yourserlf, and think:Why did they put ONLY TWO songs from the second Led Zeppelin album (which is one of their best).Where is Bonzo's drum solo, Moby Dick? And there where really good songs on the second Zep. album like Lemon song?The great heavy-riffed Heartbreaker is not in the collection.They left also Going to California - which is got a very beautiful song. Why not? Misty Mountain Hop? Where?You're stranded at the moon. You can only bring seven cds (I, II, III, IV, Houses of the holy, Physical Graffiti, and Presence). This is NOT the first."
4,Led Zeppelin rules!,"Despite what other people say, Led Zeppelin is gifted in the music department. Maybe I'm a little young to like Led Zeppelin but they are still very gifted musicians. If they were still alive today, they would be making the best music of all time."
1,"boaring, the same songs like in the remastered cd","Death boaring! the same released songs like in the Remastered album. Wha a commercial rock band, The songs are overwhelming and were too much overplayed by the radio stations. Would you save the money Buddy? if you already have the original albums? think about it!"
1,the battle had lost,"why did the record company release the whole same materials again? buy the original albums! the whole songs are found in the Remastered version,...Iam not a huge fann of them, but Iappreciated the band. We all know that this band is very commercial in the USA, but it would be a good idea if Plant and Page would make a new album together with Jones. Not only releasin the same boaring materials..."
1,This is not good,If this is the best of Led Zeppelin I'd hate to hear the worst of them.That's the last time I buy an album of this band.And I DO like hard rock.
4,Good but not excellent.,"Pros: Easy to follow, each hand fingering is marked very clearly(something a lot of books miss).Cons: Maybe 5-6 songs out of the 20 are interesting, only a short section of each song is in the book.Flight of the Bumble Bee is very short, Jesu has part of the first verse. I would have liked to see the complete songs in the book. I did like the explicit fingerings shown in the book which cuts down practice time. This book is decent but not the end all speed book. I would still buy Dave's other books, as this is a decent book.BTW 'Speed mechanics for lead guitar' by Stetina has a complete version of Flight of the Bumble Bee."
4,what does that mean fluff?,"If you could put the white stripes and edie brickell and the new bohemians in a jar and shake it up, then poor it out onto a cd, this is damn close to what it would sound like."
3,"Have Heart Hoodie, (Sweat Shirt)","This sweat shirt is a little weak for the price. Except for the logo I would expect to find this quality at Walmart for $10 or maybe $15. The art work has good detail, but is allready flaking a little after 10 careful washings following directions. Normal for this type of application, I guess.Shipping was fast. Item arrived in a large manila envelope in about a week.I am an enthusiastic Have Heart fan and wanted some thing to show my feelings. I hope the band got a fair share of my cost.Thanks for reading,Chris"
4,Well researched historic overview of an unique location,"The Stronghold captivates the reader's interest from the initial story about early colonial life and those human struggles in a part of our nation that served as the springboard for the rest of us. The author utilizes the ""short story"" technique to present a variety of life styles, a blend of humor with hardships of the time, and a historical perspective on the role played by this Rappahannock River transportation highway utilized by western settlers."
4,"Love it, but ........","I love the look of this bag, but however, I was dissapointed to return the first one because the cell phone/wallet's zipper broke. They mailed me another one and it did the same, so don't plan on using it as a wallet for long, just the cell phone holder. It carries alot and It looks like a large purse. So i'm keeping it."
5,Good hardware design book!!,"This book is filled with lots of examples of ""real"" examples, such as how to design a CPU, Memory interfaces, etc. in verilog. The approach is completely different than that of ""Verilog HDL: A Guide to Digital Design and Synthesis."" The latter book is primarily a ""language"" book. It has no real designs from top to bottom. This book does, as it is an ""implementation"" book. I recommend this book for anyone serious about hardware design. The only drawback is it does not cover PLI's."
3,Very dissapointing,"We got this fo rmy son for his 3rd birthday mainly because of the loader feature. Unfortunatly, the loader is really hard for him to operate, it is even pretty hard for us to do!Putting it together was no picnis either!The worst feature is the fact that the lid does NOT keep water out at all! I called Little Tikes and they advised me ot buy tarps. I think it is crazy, that I should have to buy more items to keep the sand from being soggy. Little Tikes claims the lid is not to keep the sand dry. What exactly is it for then?The lid is also very flimsy, so if you are trying to use it as a ramp as they intend, it bows and sags under the weight of a truck with sand.We buy a lot of Little Tikes toys and have never had such a let down. We paid alot for this and I do want to say Little Tikes did send us toys amounting to the total we spent. Still we are dissapointed."
1,Huge Disappointment!!,"My kids are really into construction, so I was excited to get this sandbox for them. I was very disappointed to find out that the lid does not fit well and there is constantly water in the sandbox. The water also gets in the dump bucket, even if you turn it over, it gets under the lip of the bucket. Very unsanitary, not to mention costly for all of the sand you have to replace. I would stick with the Turtle Sandbox, the kids seem to have more fun and it is less maintenance."
1,a little tikes dissapointment,"When I saw the ad for this sandbox I decided that my 2 year old son had to have it. Boy was I wrong. The box itself retains water when it rains, I had to drill holes in the bottom so the water could drain. As a result there is wet sand most of the time. The crane is difficult to work for kids of any age. My kids ended up playing in the neighbors turtle sandbox."
1,Breeding Ground for Mosquitos,My boys recvd this sandbox for Xmas & it is just horrible....the rain leaks extremely bad....I finally decided to visit little tykes ' website and send some feedback about its construction....I wasnt expecting anything back but they ended up sending me a check for the purchase price of it....but it seems they arent going to change the way it is built anytime sooni dont recommend this to anyone unless you have it under a cover of some sort
3,Buy a different sandbox!,"This sandbox is not what you would expect from Little Tikes. My son received it for his first birthday. It turned out to be the biggest disappointment. He only played in it a few times because it became a swimming pool when it rained, even with the lid and a tarp. The sand got moldy from being wet with puddles all the time. We never got the digger to work right - it was awkward even for adults. Little Tikes took care of the problem......they gave us a REFUND! We now have a sandbox from Step 2 which keeps the sand dry."
4,ultimate sandbox,"What a hit with our six year old! It took my husband an hour to assemble it. Glad we started early. It is a little difficult to keep the sand in the box around the blue parts, but it has provided hours of fun for our son."
