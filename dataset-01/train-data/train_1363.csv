2,Disappointing,"The more I watch O'Reilly, the more I realize he is not as moderate as he portrays himself. As a moderate, I find this insulting to my intelligence.That being said, this is just not a great book. There is really a lot of repetition of the material from his first 2 books. There is even a paragraph that appears two times in the book, with the exact same wording. I'll chalk that one up to a mistake by the editors though.This book is only 220 pages, with generously wide double spacing, large font, and about 40% of the information is reproduced from his other books...save your money. If you must buy this book, please buy my used copy that I'm trying to unload."
1,Listen to the NPR interview first. It might save you $$.,"If you must read it, rent it at the library. This guy comes across as such a loud-mouth bully, it's amazing anyone watches his show let alone buys his books."
1,'shut up!',Bill O'Reilly defames public institutions and fights against our civil liberties. Not worth a penny.
1,Hell of a Nerve,I read this book with it's large print and double spacing at a bookstore in about a half an hour. That this padded rehashed dribble can list for 25 bucks and that people would be so gullible to waste money on it is truly frightening. The only thing O'Reilly is looking out for is his pocketbook.
1,Wow this is bad!!!,Bought this book. Read about 15 pages and it stinks. I tried to give it away to family and friends and not one person would accept it. I gave it to Goodwill!
3,Response to criticism from a random observer,"First of all I would like to state that I have only read the preceeding advertised one paragraph review of this controvesial book. I have had some other encounters with Mr. O'Reilly's TV show and column, however I still feel qualified to defend it from the negative? comments prior. These reviewers both refer to the fact? that Mr. O'Reilly is not an accepted? ""Trained Thinker"" or degree gifted? ""journalist"". They both give the impression that they not only feel competent to judge O'Reilly's Un-Trained Thinkingness but also fall prey to the same kind simplistic name calling so decried by people who hold opposing? views to O'Reilly's /fans. Namely me. Perhaps one day ""Big Skinny Idiot""ism will be all the rage or maybe Corny Insults and Fractured Sentence Structuralism will previal. If it does I hope I can't figure out which is which."
1,kindergarden reading at its worst,It's clear to anyone that watches Fox that the man cannot speak. Now we know he cannot write as well.
5,Bill O'Reilly Commentary,"Product arrived on time, as advertised. This is a good read for people honestly seeking the truth about what is going on in American culture today. Flaming Liberals will hate it. Open minded people will become more aware of modern chicanery. Good read!"
4,Getting more full of himself,"I used to really love him, but it seems he gets more full of himself a with each passing year. He's gotten to the point that he latches onto a thought on a subject he knows nothing about and then becomes dogmatic, not listening to anyone else, even an expert. He is what he is, but I wish he'd be more open minded before he attacks."
2,Obvious stuff from an abusive and abrasive guy.,"I wouldn't recommend this book, just as I wouldn't recommend Al Franken's new book. O'Reilly may be the most insulting, abusive, and downright sickening figure on the national scene. It isn't because of his opinions. Indeed, his opinions are all over the place, most settling in the moderate middle. (Okay, in some respects he's extreme, but he's more of a populist than an extremist.) And granted, he can't scream at you from a book. But just as he rudely treats his many guests (always with the standard, empty effort to appear reasonable, ""Hey, but I respect your right to disagree""), this book, in effect, is just as rude to its readers--punctuating truisms with arrogance and one-sided views.And maybe it's all a big act. Maybe Bill isn't as awful a human being as he consistently appears to be on his show. Maybe his loud sanctimony is all staged for ratings. We can only hope, and change the channels to avoid it."
1,PURE RIGHT-WING NONSENSE!,I READ THIS BOOK AND WAS DISGUSTED. O'REILLY HAS ONLY ONE GOAL AND THAT IS TO MARKET HIS PARTICULAR BRAND OF HYPE. HE UNDER ESTIMATES THE AMERICAN PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO SPOT A FRAUD. BUY THIS BOOK AT YOUR PERIL- IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND A POOR READ. ZERO STARS IS THE TRUE MEASURE OF THIS WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!
1,Would you trust a man named Bill O'LIE-lly?,"After reading Al Franken's ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,"" I thought it was only fair to read just what Bill O'Reilly (one of the book's many targets)was all about. After the 200th page (yes, you can actually read 200 pages of this book in an hour-it's that thin!), I abruptly closed to book, returned it to the humor section (since it was so laughable), and drove back to work, angry that I had wasted an entirely lunch hour. For a man that decries the use of ""spin"" in politics, he sure uses a lot of it in his book. There is not one shred of proof he uses to back up his claims. Not even a footnote. Instead, he tries to bludgeon the poor reader in the head until he or she either believes him or not. And if you don't, then you're simply an idiot. That's basically the crux of Billy Boy's writing style. The only value this book can possibly have is a door stop or a paper weight."
4,"""Sure, it common sense.....but......""","A good read....sure, it's common sense, but in today's world everyone needs it spelled out for them sometime. What confuses me is all the bad reviews--more like attacks on O'Reilly instead of the book--which makes me wonder why people who seem to hate O'Reilly so much would spend $25 on his book? Hmmmm.....makes you think.....I certainly don't have money to spend on a book by a guy I hate.....here come's that common sense issue again......"
3,"Good, but falls way short of previous titles....","I enjoy Bill O'Reilly and have read his previous books with great interest. As a fan I must say this latest book, however, is a dissapointment. Quite frankly the book seemed pieced together in great haste in an attempt to release another book to sell before Christmas. There is so little factual information in this book I think I could have written it in a three day weekend. I read the thing cover to cover in two days and found it short of any new research, any new insight, or any useful material. It was still ok, but a dissapointment nevertheless."
3,Some good info and watered down facts.,"True to his form, Mr. O'Reilly comes out swinging and he is attacking a variety of establishments and/or policies or lack of policies within them. If you watch the O'Reilly Factor or read his previous books, there is not much new in this book. There are some new facts and tidbits in the book that help strengthen his arguments, but he is attacking the same people and things (media companies, Hillary, Jesse, the border problem, etc.) Not that these problems don't need addressing, it is just that these aren't new when coming from Bill.Bill does a lot of good by keeping things in our faces that many or media companies and/or reporters find too hard or controversial to cover. But this book is just a rehash of his show and his past books in a new format. It is better to give to someone who is not so familiar with him and his arguments."
1,Waste of Time & Money,"Once again O'Reily fills up a couple of hundred pages of garbage. Reading this and other books by the author, one gets the impression that they are being talked down to. O'Reily's arrogant, know-it-all attitude gets really old after awhile. Though I often agree with him on some things, I get the impression that he doesn't know why he belives the way he does. He just seems to want to get a reaction out of people. Now that he is so well-known he seems to be putting out books with alot of filler in it. All I know is my life and wallet would be better off had I not read this book."
1,224 pages of ranting and nothing to back it up,"I enjoyed reading the Factor and somewhat Liked The No spin zone, Whats Wrong Bill why are your books now becoming more shameless ways to insult people, I was very disapointed with His new book I find it ironic that amazon is offering the best value package buy Who's Looking out for you and Ann Courters Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right both seem to be written buy Lying ""I don't have to back up my rants"" nutcases."
1,Waste of Money,"Bill is so stuck on himself, this book just stinks. I dont believe hes being truthful about many things in this book. I question even his so called college degreeeees!"
1,Save Your Money!,"I found this book to be pretentious and boring, the book is short, large type (like all of O'reilly's books) and simple minded. The ""Bill OReilly"" phenomena has run it's course, he's just simply annoying now."
5,The Critic Liberals Love To Hate,"As a recovering liberal, former Republican and one-time Green Party member, I find Bill interesting, annoying, but many times right on the mark, with his critiques of American society. He isn't right or left, but rather common sense, much as Ben Franklin was a voice of reason in his time. If you are willing to be challenged by opinions which are intelligent and which contradict your own prejudices, give this book a try... and if you have a fixed-view and only listen to PBS, forget this book... you've already become the close-minded person you pretend not to be!"
1,"Take A Chill Pill, Bill!","There now appears to be an equal number of people writing""reviews"" for this book based on his obnoxious treatment of Terry Gross on ""Fresh Air"" as the ones who have actually read his book. People would actually pay MONEY to read his arrogant opinions on paper?? After listening to his condescending diatribes on ""Fresh Air"", I'm beginning to understand why Al Franken's book is #3 on Amazon.com'sbestseller list, and Bill's is down at # 16..."
2,Big fan of Bill but...,I couldn't finish this book. I wasn't impressed with the first two and I'm just downright insulted by this one. I'm obviously not his intended audience. Too preachy for me. I don't need Bill to tell me right from wrong or how to live my life. I'd be more interested in his insights into current issues based on the kind of access to public figures and information Bill has that most of the rest of us don't. Just can't get into Bill telling me how to live a successful life. I've already figured that out...
3,Who's Looking Out For You,"Who's Looking Out For YouWell I hate to say it, but what Bill O'Reilly writes about in his book is what every one of us already knew or should have known. Nothing new in what he is writing about, if you didn't know the best person to watch out for you is yourself then maybe you do need to read Mr. O'Reilly's book. You should also know the people that you can trust to help out should be the people that are the closest to you, but then again sometimes even close people will turn their back on you if you your not watching out for number one. Like Mr. O'Reilly's TV show Mr. O'Reilly has set himself up as a know it all, on just about everything. I do agree with Mr. O'Reilly on most of what he says and writes about but do like to hear both sides and not just Bill O'Reilly one sided way of doing his business. I think for most people the book is a good read and the rest should already know who's looking out for you with out reading. Larry Hobson- Author ""The Day Of The Rose"""
4,Not Exactly God's Design,"The author took great pains to illustrate how man contorts the design of God for his own purposes. More than anyone else, he appears to have made great progress in showing how man cannot depend upon other men, God's first choice. When men (or women or children) must look out for themselves because there is so little of God in everyone else, it surely is a signal that mankind has failed in his mission to be ""godly,"" the way we were taught to be, in theory, through the Bible and other religious texts. Since we cannot count upon God's presence and grace in man, we have either ourselves or no one. The author chooses the middle path since he apparently has no evidence of the former either, or can't seem to find it. Hence, it's either ourselves or no one. Basically, if we cannot trust ourselves, and cannot trust others, God is not likely to be there either since both are offensive, in theory, to him."
1,The Republicans Aren't Looking Out For You!,And Bill O'Reilly doesn't give a damn about the country.
1,Even worse than I thought it would be,"O'Reilly wants to blame Mexicans and Blacks for all the problems our country is having. He correctly identifies many of the problems, but spins the answers. Not a liberal or a conservative myself, I still think that O'Reilly's audience is very uneducated and need a tabloid artist, such as O'Reilly, to brainwash them. This book is truly pathetic."
1,Me?!,"This compendium of letters arranged as words is outrageous, ill-conceived, sometimes funny and always just plain sad. I do agree with the author on one point: the INS should have kept out all those free-loading immigrants that have despoiled our country, espescially the Irish. Compared to similar publications, called books, this doe not hold up well. I would suggest an actual book, preferably written by an actual rational being."
4,Pithy,"A simple, unbiased book. It's so simple the intellectual counterfeits of the left should even enjoy it. I wonder how many of the 200+ one star ""reviewers"" actually read it, though.Let's be clear. Bill OReilly IS a centrist---perhaps slightly right of center. He is not Sean Hannity, Rush or Ann Coulter for better or worse. He castigates Bush, the religious right and federal spending often. He does, however, reserve his most bitter condemnation for the lowest forms of American life: the far, hate-filled left.If you like the pedophile and terrorism supporters of the ACLU, you won't like this book. If you watch Bill's show, the only time he becomes enraged is when people denounce our heroic troops, praise the enemy of support those who murder children or protect those murderers.This short book is to the point, eye-opening and worthwhile. I wish others could take off their dogmatic blinders and realize this."
1,Blow Hard Bill,"I just listened to the Terry Gross interview with Bill O'Reilly on NPR. Little Terry had poor Bill blowing up like a 4th of July fire cracker. In fact, she flustered him so much that Blow Hard Bill stomped off the show. What a man of courage. Seriously, she got him to admit that his father beat the cr&p out of him when he was a kid. Perhaps this explains why he is such an insecure bully."
1,Not a good book!,"Plain and simple, this book is just not good. I didn't enjoy any part of this book, and found it to be very boring. Even if you believe what Bill O'Reilly is saying, it is not an interesting read. There are much better books out there. I wouldn't waste my time on this book."
1,Apologist for a liar.,"The so-called no spin zone is nothing but spin. This ""journalist"" bullies and talks over anyone who doesn't agree with his sophomoric opinions. True conservatives ought to be embarrased by this guy."
1,"""Shut up! Shut up! Cut his mike!""","Really, this guy's just looking out for his own wallet.But don't believe me, read the book...The words in the title of my review are words O'Reilly actually spoke, to someone who had the temerity to disagree with him.That's not the kind of ""edge"" this book purports to give one (he claims to tell you how to be a ""problem solver."")Physician, heal thyself."
1,BORING...,I borrowed this book from a friend...I would never buy anything from this man. I made it not quite halfway through and had enough.This was a lousy book...
4,Wish I had read this earlier in life,"I agreed on Bill's take on how to recognize those that are looking out for you and those who are not. Unfortunately, I took a lot of bull from those who are NOT looking out for me, before I realized all this stuff on my own. Nonetheless, it was a good read and many points made in the book stirred emotion in me. I figured it would be good stuff for my kids to learn early on in life; unfortunately, the vocabulary used is far too advanced for the average young teen. I see that Bill now has a version of this for kids that I might just buy."
1,What a waste of good paper.,"For all his righteous bluster and supposed lack of spin, he is obviously biased. It cracks me up that people take this guy seriously, given that unless he can cut you off he runs away like a sissy.""Shut up!"", seems to be his best way of quieting a worthy opponent. He claims that others slander or libel him when he constantly attacks and lies about those who disagree with him.He is a classic example of the right-wingnut constituency that listens to him. It is kinda sad that a man like this has any audience much less the nationwide audience Fox gives him.Buy Al Franken's book instead!"
1,The Narcissist strikes again,"Self-pontification from start to finish. However, those of us who choose to actually think for ourselves have long known this about O'Reilly.Who's looking out for me? Definitely not you Bill...."
1,"All About Him, Not About You","This book is a waste of time. The author has an inflated self-worth, he does not offer any intelligent advice. As I read it, I was appalled at his lack of empathy..in a book that is supposed to offer me help. You are much better off saving your money, or looking elsewhere for help. Don't buy this book and encourage this self absorbed egoist. I fell for the implications of the book, and feel very dumb to have even wasted my time reading it. I hope my review will save you the same bad experience."
1,Al Franken will love this book,"If Bill hates doctored pictures on covers of books, he shoud fire his air brusher for this cover. Wow, how much makeup should a man wear?"
1,o'reilly looks out for your cash,"Do not buy this book!I have now 'looked out for you' more than this book ever will! The book is badly written, it is in desperate need of grammer...and dont get me started on the content! I always knew that O'reilly was a hard lined radical conservative, but this book borders on the ridiculous!"
2,Ego run rampant,"Just by the title of this review, i realize i am setting myself up to be slammed by O'Reilly's avid fans. But i went into this book with an open mind, hoping to find something that would make me understand the man's views on certain subjects. What i found instead was a person who tries to blame ""Hollywood moguls"" for the downfall of the country. I wish it were as simple as that, Bill. The sucess of his TV show has most definitely gone to this guy's head, and he needs to focus on the issues he proclaims to know so much about, instead of just trying to sound smarter then he obviously is. He may have some valid points, but his ""what i think is right, and all other points of view are wrong!"" attitude gets old, really fast."
1,*laugh*,Well I wouldn't actually call this a book - it's more like a pamphlet. Laughable content is mercifully short.
1,Al Franken's Book Depicts Him More Accurately,"Read ""Lies, and the Lying Liars that Tell Them."" That book really digs into O'Reilly's statements and finds the truth. I read Al Franken's book first and it makes reading Bill O'Reilly much more fun. O'Reilly's book is inherently comical, but not entertaining unless you read the truth from Al Franken first."
3,good for killing time,"Let me start with the fact that I have never seen a single ""factor"" show, neither did I ever hear O'Reilly on the radio. I have HEARD about him, of course, but never read any of his material before.That said, How did I end up reading the book? I was bored, and found it, so I read it.He starts off OK in the introduction describing the kind of people who would read this book. I thought I fit the description, more or less so I kept reading.He goes on to explain why politicians, journalists, activists, lawyers - even the Pope etc. are not looking out for you. Some of it was OK, I agreed politically with a couple of things, but it was not well written and there was too much about himself.as for balanced, I think it was pretty fair, he told both sides of the story most of the time.Its a good read when you are bored."
4,"How to ID the good, the bad and the ugly!","O'Reilly's book was an enjoyable and easy read. The only criticism I have is that a great deal of the subject matter detailed in the book was basically an ""instant replay"" for the regular viewers of the ""Factor's - No Spin Zone"". It was a bit like ""preaching to the choir"". As such I felt that I did not get my money's worth!However . . . I do believe that the book was an effective way to raise awareness about who IS or ISN'T looking out for you as you travel through life. Some of the clues as to who, what, when, where and how to do that were helpful!"
1,What a ripoff!,"This book was a major disappointment. I generally like Bill O'Reilly, have purchased his first two books, and listen to his daily radio program. The content of this book is just a rehash of what O'Reilly spouts off each day. There's very little here that I haven't heard again and again on the radio over the past 12 months.The talk radio machine (Sean Hannity, Laura Ingram, O'Reilly, Savage, etc.) has quite a nice book racket going. Almost without exception the books are short, simplistic, and a rerun of their shows. ""Who's Looking Out for You?"" is a blatant example of this. It's only 212 pages. The font and margins are gigantic (not to mention all the blank pages in between chapters). In a regular font that's single-spaced this is more like a pamphlet. As for the content almost 90% is recycled from his TV and radio show.Let me just say that Bill is not looking out for you with this ""book."""
1,Completely off base!,"Terible doesn't adequately describe this book. Bill O'Reilly has no sense of what this country is about. I am glad that this book was a complete flop, compared to all of the democrat's books that are out there. Better luck next time, Bill!"
1,This guy needs to Lighten Up,"Hes SERIOUSLY gonna develop an Ulcer, if he hasnt already. Its funny that a guy who use to work for the Tabloid show ""Inside Edition"" like O'Reilly would be such a bully. What a HYPOCRITE. 1/2 of his book are straight out LIES. The title of his book should REALLY be ""I'm looking out for O'Reilly"" cuz its just another way to dupe hard working conservative americans out of their money. He panders to conservatives like Strom Thurmond panders to racists. Dont you guys get it? Its the GREAT AMERICAN SWINDLE- And all you Right Wingers are WILLING PARTICIPANTS!!"
1,who's lloking out for you,"Total drek. Bill O'reilly should quit while he is ahead. Misinformed and full of himself. His last books were much better. What a waste of money, save your $24.95 and borrow it from the library if you care to waste your time"
1,I ran out of toilet paper...,"While reading this book on the can. Thankfully, the pages weren't any rougher than industrial strength teepee. People with septic tanks beware..."
1,Racist Oreilly ....,"Bill Oreilly called Mexicans ""Wetbacks"" on his show. I called , mailed and emailed FOX News to let them know that he should be reprimended for this.He is a despicable excuse for a so called leader in the journalistic world. One day he will get the point.BTW, I dont think his book was meant for anything other than to line his pockets with cash. I want to throw up every time he ends his show with "" The spin stops here because we're looking out for you ""GAG!"
1,Bill O'Reilly sucks,"Before Bill O'Reilly's interview with Cam'Ron and Damon Dash, I could've cared less about O'Reilly. It seems to me that O'Reilly only has negative things to say about rappers. When Cam'Ron said that violent movies, such as The Terminator, are just as bad for children as his music. Then Bill was saying that The Terminator is a cartoon. O'Reilly must be pretty ignorant, because The Terminator is not a cartoon. Plus, O'Reilly constantly interrupted Cam'Ron and Dash, because it's his show. I knew O'Reilly was full of crap when he complained that Ludacris had the most vulgar and violent lyrics. Bill doesn't even know Ludacris, and I highly doubt he's listened to Ludacris' music, so Bill doesn't really know what he's talking about. He's the kind of guy who doesn't like rappers period. Some people believe that O'Reilly is racist, but I just think Bill is a douchebag who has to complain about things that aren't politically correct. I hope this review helped you out.Peace."
1,Political Comedy at High Levels,"Once again, O'Reilly provides pure political comedy. Franken's 'Lies' is very humorous and full of facts, but apparently Billy likes to skip the facts and shoot straight for the comedy portion. As long as Billy isn't looking out for me, I will feel quite content here in America. If he ever starts I suppose I can hook up with Rush Limbaugh's maid to get me a little something to sustain me in this HORRIBLE liberal media stained society."
2,Soooo Right!,"Billy O'Reilly is always right because he never gives anybody time to raise an argument. You gotta appreciate that in a guy. Hitler had to use thugs to get people to shut up but all O'Reilly has to do is turn of their mic.Bill O'Reilly is a tall guy, but he can stoop really low when he needs to deal a blow. He can also dodge bullets, claiming to have never said what he said or never meant what he meant. . .then accuse Kerry of flip flopping.You gotta love Bill O'Reilly. If you don't, then you must be un-American. In fact, if you disagree with him then you're disagreeing with Bush and that means you're against the war on terrror so you may as well be an enemy combatant contained in Guantanamo Bay.Bill doesn't like to talk about the dark side of the Bush dynasty. I wouldn't either if my career relied upon bashing political figures that oppose his party.For a great partisan read with below the belt jabs, grab this book and read it like there is no Word but THE WORD of Bill O'Reilly."
5,God,"If you enjoy his TV and radio shows, you will enjoy Bill O'Reilly's ""Who's Looking Out For You"", and you will have a written record of what he says on the small screen and the airwaves. Before you decide on an answer to the title's question, I suggest that, after reading ""Who's Looking Out For Me"", you go on to read Norman Thomas Remick's book about America called ""West Point: Character Leadership---Thomas Jefferson"" for a great historical and philosophical perspective that tells you how it's the founding fathers, through The Constitution, who are looking out for you, and after that its in the hands of you and God. Bill O'Reilly's ""Who's Looking Out For You"" aptly lays out the problems. But, remember, when all is said and done, ""only God can make a tree""."
1,Load of crap!,I don't believe this man tells the truth about anything at all. I can't believe I used to watch his show...
1,What a joke--and I'm not laughing,"So my wife--who has a great, if wicked, sense of humor--bought me both this and the Franken book for my birthday. I used to listen to O'Reilly occasionally on the radio; no more. Guy's a pompous windbag. He makes Rush Limbaugh look thoughtful and empathetic.I score it Franken 1, O'Reilly 0."
1,Terribly flawed,"For the most part, this is a delightful book. As I read this book, I felt as though I were curling up at the feet of a masterful boyfriend, listening to his words of wisdom. (I don't know why that uppity chit found his calls offensive.) Unfortunately, I am very, very afraid that I have to differ with Bill on one point: Jeb Bush. So what if social services have crumbled during his tenure as governor of Florida? Tens of thousands of brown children are being sacrificed in our glorious adventure in Iraq. Why worry about Florida? Jeb Bush is a loyal soldier devoted to the cause. He handily delivered the state to his brother, our leader. I would think that gives him carte blanche, n'est ce pas? (I am just checking to make sure that you are not French, Bill.)One star only. Get with the program."
1,One star for the correct use of punctuation,"What a sad, disheartening book by a sad, disheartening man. On a side note: Why do rabid defenders of this book love using so many exclamation points? (""Goddamn liberals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"") We can hear you. Calm down."
1,An unimpressive effort by O'reilly,"Not worth a trip to the library, let alone your hard earned cash. An unimpressive book of opinion by an unimpressive author. Hard to finish."
3,I've noticed a pattern...,"Anyone else notice something? Most of these reviews are either 1 star or 5 stars, and I think it would be safe to say that the reviewers could have written them without cracking open the book. Aren't people getting tired of this? We're paralyzing our country with this kind of partisan bickering and just yelling without thinking. I'm sure this book deserves neither 1 nor 5 stars. However, if you haven't read the book yet, follow my example and stop encouraging the pundits: don't buy these kinds of books. Don't buy O'Reilly's, don't buy Franken's, same with Coulter and Moore. Buy a book that asks questions rather than tells you the supposed answers. Think for yourself, don't let these blowhards think for you.(P.S. Sorry for voting, but I didn't have a choice. 3's the average anyway, so it doesn't change anything.)"

1,"Can you say short, sour, and way off the point!!!",I read half the book in about 45 minutes. Its just about 200 pages big type and no citation of credible sources. Need I say more??
1,wish I bought the Brooklyn Bridge instead,"I am not entirely frugal, but this was truly money flushed.How can anyone be so wrong so often and write books?"
1,BIl is only looking out for his pockets.,This is just like all his other books. Big government and letting him act like he is doing something. He is male Nancey grace.
2,Compounded Arrogance and Egocentrism,"Seems my last review didn't make it through the censorship process. However, I won't keep my arms crossed and watch silly right-wingers give this piece of manure of a book 5 stars. Just as liberals give 1 star to it. Neither rating is deserved. The book as any from O'Reilly is mediocre at best. The Irony of it all is that he claims to know everything there is to know. He, the person who used to work for a TV tabloid show, claims to have insights into the innermost mechanics of our world. Ludicrous!Bill makes himself look great on TV by inviting weak guests and by bullying those who DO know a thing or two.Giving this book 5 stars is as ridiculous as giving it 1. People should stop rating a book based ad homiens.If you like O'Reilly (and his arrogant stupidity) go ahead and buy this boook, if you don't like O'Reilly go ahead and speak your mind, but DO NOT write a review if you have not read this book in its entirety."
1,See Al Franken's Book...,"This guy lies like every five minutes. He even lied about pressuring Fox to sue Al, but then came out and said he didn't regret pressuring Fox to sue Franken! What a trustworthy guy!"
2,Who's looking out for the sexually harrassed?,"Glad I was able to borrow this rather than buy. It his his show in a book. By the way I have never seen such consistantly low ratings. Could it be that the majority of his fans can't read? I have to believe this guy makes a few bucks between his show, radio and books. Why does he have to fall to the level of hawking factor crap on his show. Even Hannity is above that. I gave him 1 star above the default minimum for spelling and grammer. 0 for useful content."
5,Short read with great content.,The candid Bill O'Reilly uses lots of facts to back up his arguments. The reason why I liked O'Reilly's book was because he used facts and not opinions to back up his points. Bill uses things that he has learned in his life to inform the reader how to make decisions in their own life. Bill teaches morals and values in this book. Nobody can argue with Bill that morals are a great thing to cherish and a sheild that can be used to stay away from corruption. The reason why I loved this book so much was because Bill informs the reader who is truely looking out for you. Bill teaches to be a problem solver and to stay away from destructive people.
2,Iron fisted splotchy guy looking out for you,All that really has to be said is to refer to the book expo in L.A. where O'Reilly and Franken were both hawking their books. Who was the cooler of the two? Who can take criticism? Watch the whole thing. Cooler heads will prevail.
1,Same as other O'Reilly books,"just rants, rants, rants, without any substance. If you like O'Reilly then you'll probably believe this book. It's funny because his book isnt supposed to be humor , but it is."
1,Yuk!,"This book made me sick to my stomach to read. He has no sense of reality, and the books is filled with a lot of untruth. Not a good book!"
1,Who's Looking Out for You? Not O'Reilly,"This book isn't as entertaining as ""Those Who Trespass""--Bill's steamy (yes--steamy--this from ""Mr. Clean"") novel of a television host/serial killer (I kid you not--look it up yourself). This book is more of the same crud he dishes out on his show."
1,BUY THIS BOOK! DEFEAT EVIL AND DARK FORCES!!!,"Hey everyone! Save the world, defeat evil! BUY THIS BOOK! Conquer the dark forces that want to put Bill down!"
1,Who's Looking Out For You? Not O'Reilly,"Bill O'Reilly has been soundly outed as a liar by more than a few people, so why should anyone read or trust his books? Check out The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly by Peter Hart, Robert W. McChesney.""O'Reilly's 'no-spin' motto is clever marketing-but who's keeping track of O'Reilly's own spin? From his support for Bush's tax cuts and the war with Iraq to his attacks on everything from National Public Radio to 'welfare mothers,' O'Reilly often contradicts himself and consistently concocts evidence to support his conservative talking points.""...review by Al Franken, author of Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell ThemO'Reilly has successfully catered to America's thin-skinned, angry right by telling people who can't bear to hear the truth the lies they would prefer to hear.O'Reilly only looks out for himself."
4,Different take on his usual rants,"This third book of his which revolve around his viewpoints shown on his popular TV show, The O'Reilly Factor, is a quick, insightful read into the mind of The Man, Mr. Bill O'ReillyLike his other books, he talks a lot about corruption in high places and how it hurts the little person. This book also discusses difficulties of everyday life, but from a personal viewpoint. He offers advice on how to find ..., and how to identify who is looking out for you.My favorite parts of the book were his top 10 tips for being a good parent and his discussion on the myth of ""Seperation of Church and State""Overall this book is a quick and fun read. It offers good, though pretty much common sense, advice on life from a man who appears to be looking out for you."
1,"Vomit, pure and simple.","The rantings of a sick demagogue turn out to be surprisngly fun to read, but in the same way is it's ""fun"" to see an overturned car on the freeway.Get a mop and clean it up; or it will leave your house in a huff- or , if you're lucky, in a minute and a huff."
1,"Al Franken, that's who.........","O'Reilly has all the answers, so why read anyone else? Typical ""No Spin"" fare: self-righteous drivel from the biggest ego on television. Fans will love it, but then again those people love everything that doesn't require deep thought."
1,egomaniacal ranting,"If Bill was really looking out for me, the common working man, why not put the book online ...for free?"
2,"I tried, I really did.","A friend who is rather conservative and with whom I argue constantly asked me if I would read this. I'll leave the political discussions to the other reviewers. O'Reilly is simply not a very good writer. I began to ""skim"" after the first two chapters, then gave up. If he has a point to make, I think it is this: you had better look out for your own interests. Thanks Bill. How could we possibly have known that?He skips from topic to topic, and rambles needlessly. I just found it really hard to follow his train of thought."
1,"I may be young, but this man is a fool","He claims he is a ""moderate independent"", yet he has a show on a predominantly right-wing news source. He says he is against the death penalty, yet has spoken favorably of it in regards to Tookie Williams. He says he is pro-decriminalization of marijuana, yet has spoken out against marijuana users on several occasions.O'Reilly can pretend he's something he's not, but most intelligent people will see through him. He talks of ""smear tactics"", ""slander merchants"" and ""defamation"". He is as guilty of these as any of his opponents. I may be liberal, but I at least have the sense to not buy into the garbage of the extreme left. Its too bad Billy boy can't say the same about the far right.If O'Reilly had all the integrity he claimed, why does he tell people to shut up on his talkshow? Why does he walk out on interviews with intelligent people? The fact is the man has not come to terms with his own political insecurities. He's a coward"
1,"Blather On, Bill","Being and Fair and Balanced kinda guy, I figured I'd give Bill a shot after having recently read Al Franken's entertaining, informative, and thoroughly researched ""Lies and the Lying Liars..."" While it's true that Bill actually has some decent insights in this book, it's mostly the kind of insight any adult picks up from their own life experience. His writing style is fine, workmanlike, but fine (I'm no great writer myself). As for the negatives of this book, well, Bill's a bit of a holier-than-thou type that really grates on you after a while. And I think he sounds a little bit paranoid too. Whereas Franken backed up EVERYTHING he wrote in his book, Bill's style, aside from his own life's narration, is one more of conjecture that suits his own world view. Given his talents as talking head, I expected a better book - at least more entertaining than this preachy diatribe. His politics are another story, but this is a book review..."
1,God is looking out for me.,"This fop is no more Catholic than he is conservative. FYI, Bill, extreme virtue is never a vice."
5,You decide,"This book reminds me of my neighbor's back yard dog - - barking at everything in sight and every sound made. Barking dogs are generally annoying and unless you get to know them, you're never really sure if they're friendly or just mean-spirited. This dog may or may not be friendly but its purpose is clear . . . to be on the lookout for anything suspicious.It occurs to me that Bill O'Reilly is like my neighbor's dog, unrelenting in his bark - - facing what's wrong in the world head-on. After reading this book, you'll know that the loud and persistent bark isn't mean-spirited at all, but rather, a message of warning and ""beware"". Thank you Mr. O'Reilly for looking out for all of us."
1,It should be called I'm looking after my own wallet,"Bill Orielly likes to depict himself as a person who objectively informs the American public of what is going on. He charges for his website, doormats, etc. He has obviously sold himself to: A. His own arrogance because he obviously feels the measure of a person is how much money he can make B. The right wing propaganda machine. I have read this book and Dude Where is my country by Michael Moore which is a much better resourced book. Bill stick to being a puppet for Fox. Maybe when you get a big enough pair of balls you will actually do somthing for all Americans not just the guys who put money into your coffer. This book is crap check it out at the library and save yourself a buck. Maybe Bill will give me a gold membership for this comment into his propagandist website. I can't wait..."
3,Nice to read but a lot of already-knows,"I bought this book along with Al Franken's book, at the same time. I found many errors in the Franken book so I had to give it 2 stars. I give O'reilly's book 3 because, even though it is valid in everyday life, much of its content is basically common sense (nothing mama or grandma couldn't tell you). Plus, he doesn't include any sources or facts/figures. Still a nice book to read, however."
1,Sad statement.,Looking through this book in the library I must continue to believe that the country is not doing well psychologically or socially.Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh continue to rake in the customers who are ticked off..at the wrong people many times.It's sad that so many Americans are grasping at a book like this.Thank you.Nicole
1,A Waste of Time and Money,This is largely a self-congratulatory autobiography with a rehash of stories and events from Bill O'Reilly's radio and TV programs. There are some good tips - but hardly worth the effort to wade through the whole text to find them...
2,Kinda boring,"I read the intro and part of the first chapter in the library and didn't enjoy it too much. Seems like he's trying too hard to be a ""humble correspondent"" while talking about himself too much. Does he know the meaning of the ""humble?"" I'll read more in the weeks to come.As as aside, I'd like to meantion that it really kicks ass the Franken's book came out 3 weeks ahead of Bill's but is still selling more. It's been in the top 5 on Amazon since it gained popularity and only once did I see it somewhere else (#6 at one point). Meanwhile, O'Rielly is currently wallowing in the mid 30's. Add to that the fact that Franken has spent much more time on the NY Times Bestseller's list @ #1 (6 weeks for Al compared to 1 week for Bill, I believe). And all this despite the fact that O'Rielly has his Radio show, TV show, and columns to shill his book (which he does.... endlessly). I guess Bill's fans aren't looking out for him...."
1,Boring and shrill,"This is a prime example of a over marketed, over hyped media creation (through his own network mostly). If this book is rated upon readability, factual content, and intellect it would be a 0 star non starter. Try Wesly Clarks new book if you are looking for a book with these qualities."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your money. Full of unfounded bias. As usual, Mr. O'Reilly has an agenda and it is so far from the reality of life in America today. Mr O'Reilly should stick to what he does best; hype his TV ratings by yelling uncontrollably at his guest when someone disagrees with him or trys to offer another point of view."
1,Makes a great gag gift!,A hilarious gag gift for the person with everything... including an IQ above room temperature.
1,a collection of trite cliches,"This book brings nothing new to the party. Trite cliches, stale ideas and spoon-dull wit characterize O'Reilly's latest offering. Don't even be tempted to pick it up when this book goes on the remainder racks."
1,being loud does not equate to being knowledgeable,"o'reilly is one of the first of the the loud mouth entertaiment-style FOX NEWS analysts. these folks are to political debate what jerry springer is to sociological discussion. like with springer though, simpletons love this stuff. it has almost the same entertaiment value as WWF, but it makes ya feel all smart and stuff.truth is though... o'reilly's quest for ratings (FOX) and sales (books) comes at the expense of the country. the anti liberal rantings get the right all fired up against the left. then the left gets all fired up over being called names by the right. then we all end up hating each other over BS partisan politics. the truth is, we all have to live in this country together as americans. so how about we concentrate more on the stuff we agree on, and let democracy determine the course on the other stuff (ie: voting, popular opinion)."
1,"What a boring, condescending book.","This book assumes that O'Reilly's opinions are facts and expects us to ""swallow"" them as such. It will work for the kind of people who, out of laziness, fear of the truth or whatever, don't bother checking other sources, but not for those of us who strive for the truth. (I read a review below by an O'Reilly fan that states that negative reviews on this book are made by ""wetbacks"".Enough said.At least Michael Moore presents facts first (he does give sources) and then takes conclusions.I could not finish the book. Terribly boring. I gave it away."
2,After reading this book I know who is looking out for Bill..,"I was hoping to find an insighful political commentary instead I was faced with a book in which the author spends most of the time letting the reader know that he (Mr. O'Reilly) is wonderful, all knowing, smarter than you etc....No real pratical soultions are offered and to be honest this book is not even well written. I disagree with Rush Limbaugh much of the time but at least he is entertaining. This book is a good bedtime read as it put me right to sleep."
1,This man should not write books !!!,"Poorly written, shallow, and extremely biased. I guess anyone can get published these days. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,"Bill O'Reilly is a Big, Skinny Idiot","I am glad to say that I did not spend any of my own hard earned $$ getting access to this book, but rather read it in the bookstore. Bill O'Reilly is not a trained thinker nor an intellect....he is merely a conservative person who is racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic. He is a clever marketer and self-promoter who assumes that his worldly success confers God's seal of approval upon him."
2,I've read worse,"O'Reilly is fun to watch but let's face it, he's not that bright and it show in his book. Still, there are worse things you could read and the book has it's funny moments. It sure beats the hard sex crime book he wrote (which I suffered through in morbid humor)."
1,Cry Baby,"I also wanted to check out this book after the Terry Gross interview on Fresh Air, October 8th. Bill OReilly has made an entire career out of baseless character defamation, incendiary and intellectually weak commentary, and name calling. Yet he got completely bent out of shape because a respected journalist asked him a few tough questions. I mean really, walking out of the studio? Did Terry Gross hurt your wittle feewings Bill? I guess if you can't stand the heat...As for the book, I browsed it at my local bookstore. It's a travesty that amazon doesn't have a 0 stars option on these reviews. My advice - if you feel the need to watch a temper tamtrum in action, save your money and just watch his TV show or listen to the Terry Gross interview on audiostream"
1,"Simplistic, formulaic and hackneyed",It is astounding that this level of writing can even get published. There is not an original idea in the book. The writing is sophomoric. How many times will this arrogant ignoramus spew out the same book and collect money for it?
5,A great read!,"Very informative book, Once you pick it up you wont be able to put it down. It makes you think about how many people who get the top spots on the evening news really care about what the average American has to deal with on a daily basis. Its will make you rethink on who you should support and who is trying to bring you down. Bill's best book yet!"
1,Awful book by an awful man,Bill O'Reilly has written another filthy novel. Oh is it supposed to be non-fiction well its not. He is a liar and a crook. He wants to silence dissent. He has many enemies some real and some imagined but he willed by plagued by his crimes until his death in a mental institution in a few years. O'Reilly is a third rate Rush Limbaugh except for the prescription drugs. Don't read the book buy a copy of the constitution and a copy of the Federalist papers instead.
1,Al Franklin is a LIAR CRYBABY,Al (liberal idiot)Franklin thinks Bin Laden should blow up Americans. GUESS WHAT AL???? That would mean KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE. Bill ORielly (honest man) says FRANKLIN should go to hell. I agree with BILL! If Al Franklin and Michael Moore-on think they are so smart they should show there supoort for the terrorists and get the hell out of AMERICA. President Bush is killing the Arabs and that makes the stupid idiots liberals want to destroy America. I like it when Bill says that Hillary killed all the people who had the flu and she takes your money and gives it to Barbara (stupid liberal) Stessand and Jesse Jackson so they can give all your money to the druggies and the terrorists. GO LIVE IN A CAVE WITH BIN LADEN so you can cry about the poor minorities IDIOTS. I GIVE THIS BOOK TOP STARS because Bill tells the TRUTH. I hope he punches AL FRANKLIN in his buck teeth.
2,The literary equivalent of watching paint dry.,"I love O'Reilly's radio talk program but his books just bore me to tears. I wish someone was looking out for me when I walked into the bookstore and grabbed a copy. Bill O'Reilly has got a few interesting ideas, but we've heard them all before ten times over in his last insomnia curing book, ""The No Spin Zone."" Hopefully Mr.O'Reilly will kick the entertainment level up a few notches for his next publication. I'm sticking to the radio show."
4,Sometimes i wonder,"I read this book, it was a quick read but it is a decent book. True, politicians are willing to sell you out for special interest votes. True hollywood will sell you out. The problem that i had was not with this book. The problem i have is this, a lot of reviewers wrote reviews within moments of being able to. I live on the east coast, and by the time the readers could review the book the book stores were not yet open. A lot of people with a political agenda have written reviews without having read the book. These idealogues are a disgrace to amazon and the book reviewing principle in general. Have some decency and read the book first."
1,A Cry for Help!,"Man, this guy is nuts. He's not a conservative. I'm a conservative. This guy is just nuts.This woman I'm dating thought I would like this book because we're both Republicans, but I'm having second thoughts about a long-term relationship with her if she believes that people like Bill O'Reilly represents, in any way, what I would consider good, moral, conservative values. He doesn't care about American. He's just trying to push my buttons to sell books, and I'm a bit offended at such an overt attempt to try to manipulate me into hating liberals, who I would like to add are NOT responsible for all of our country's woes.Please, if you are a fellow Republican, I urge you to disavow this book and all books like it that follow such a obvious low-brow formulaic arguments for using liberals as scapegoats. It makes us look stupid!"
4,Makes you think.,"Bill O'Reilly gives great advice. Points out many errors in society. He makes you think. Who is looking out for me? I like how he gives examples of mistakes he his make in his own life, and how they have made him a better person. My favorite quote from his book ""We are all born with a natural talent, but we must tap into it with a vengeance in order to reach our full potential."" (page 188) Yes, He is arragont and he holds people accountable. This is part of what makes him unique."
1,It must be midnight for Cinderella O'Reilly...,"The golden chariot is back to looking like a pumpkin. I have to say I've enjoyed several of his earlier offerings, and used to be a regular devotee of his show. Somehow he lost the sparkle -- or perhaps he has a new ghost'writer? One way or the other, I wouldn't mind a refund. Uses the same approach we've grown accustomed to (which I would give him credit for pioneering) that is starting to get old. You can only be a negative yet self-centered arrogant moron for so long and get away with it.Ok, I admit. I loved him until I read Al Franken's expose, at which point I felt pretty dumb for being an ""O'Leilly"" fan for so long. I had already preordered the book before buying Franken's tome, and didn't bother cancel it. Well, perhaps that's why the spit polish on O'Reilly's writing doesn't seem to shine like it used to. Put this cow out to pasture. No more milk from this bessy. This Bull is dry."
1,Spinmeister Windbag Blows More Hot Air,"Boy, has this guy snowed his fans -- with his ""no-spin"" common guy pose, this Harvard-educated multimillionaire spins his hard-right Republican talking points every night on that ""fair and balanced"" Bush Administration TV network, Fox News. Now he comes out with a self-help book that is mostly designed to cement his public persona and harden his fans to critics who expose his hypocrises and dishonest intellectual methods. Well, if you want to believe this guy really is looking out for you, you get what you pay for. But I'd be a lot more skeptical first, question O'Reilly's motives, and recognize this book for what it is -- a thinly-veiled effort to glorify (and line the pockets of) Bill O'Reilly."
1,Comments on a sociopath....,"Firstly, How can Mr. O'Reilly call his show a no-spin zone in his book(s)?He never lets a guest speak and if they do manage to get a few words in, other than the right-wing operatives, he snarlingly cuts in, so when does the self-promoted no-spin kick in?His book is simply an insult to my expectations for a readable book, once a self-promoting thug, always a self-promoting thug...."
1,dis-appointed,"If you are a regular viewer of The O'Reilly Factor, you have already heard him say all of the information on his program. I did't learn anything new. Just the same old diatribe he says on a daily basis. I am very dis-appointed. and glad I did't pay full price for this."
1,Who's looking out for you? not Bill!,The author is full of half-truths and lacks common sense.The decline and fall of America can be directly attributed to this madman's rise to power.
1,How Long Before Bill O'Reilly Apologizes to the Nation?,"In the build up to the war with Iraq, Bill O'Reilly was on television every night backing up Bush's whoppers. Like the White House team, O'Reilly assured us that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. On March 18, 2003, O'Reilly was on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" He made the following promise about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction:""If the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean, he has nothing, I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush Administration again, all right?""It's time for Bill O'Reilly to apologize to the nation and tell us that he no longer trusts the Bush Administration. How long must we wait?http://www.michaelmoore.com"
1,Narrow Minded Garbage from The Right,"If you have been Hannitized on Fox or if you like to live in your own narrow right-winged dream world, this is the perfect book for you. In OReilly's vision of America, either you fit or you don't fit. I'm glad I don't fit.I don't think I learned one new thing from this book, except, ""Watch our for the extreme right, they are dangerous for our country and our world."" Life is too short to let these scoundrels win. Thanks for letting me vent."
2,Moderation,"The unfortunate truth of the world is that nothing falls into neatly delineated black-and-white categories. One thing affects every other in chaotic and unpredictable ways. I believe that most people sense this uncertainty on some level, and it frightens them, which is unsurprising. Bill O'Reilly comforts people by telling them that everything is actually very simple, but that the leftist interests in America are undermining us at every turn, preventing us from taking the decisive action he feels we need. This approach was perfected by Adolf Hitler, who blamed the problems of Germany, which stemmed from their poor decision-making, on the Jews. He won the support of the German people by telling them that they were the best people in the world, with the best values, they just had an internal enemy who was responsible for all their problems. Does this sound familiar?"
1,"Love the man, Hate the ideals","I'm an avid avowed deeply committed Leftist Atheist, yet I have to admit: I love Bill O'Reilly. That is, I love the man, but hate nearly every one of his simplistic ideas. I cringe with absolute contempt and hatred even at the thought of Bill O'Reilly, yet at the same time, watch him on tv nearly every night. In fact, when I don't watch him, I get depressed. When I do watch him, I hate everything he says, yet still find my eyes glued to the tube. I don't know what it is about him, but he has charsima that can only be compared to Ronald Reagan's, though I believe liberals like me (radicals rally) were more indifferent to Reagan and his policies than they are to O'Reilly. Since I can't stand any of O'Reilly's ideas I can't recommend this book. I wish him well, though, and continued success!"
1,Who in Gods name would believe a word out of this mouth??,"I am agreeing with several other folkes out there who find this man to be such a joke. WHO IN GODS NAME WOULD TRUST THIS MAN??? Anyone that ""goes after"" Terri Gross is a top notch jerk in my book. Besides, like Al Franken says, his name should be called Bill O'Lielly. ""if his mouth is open, he is probably lieing"". And do not ask him to defend his opinions or allegations, or he will throw a temper tantrum and take his toys and go home. What a jerk."
1,Nice comic book,Russert held up this book during an interview - thin as O'Reilly's hair. Krugman's book looks like an unabridged encyclopedia in comparison.O'Reilly is a good person to have around when you get into an insult war with a younger sibling(...).(...)Who's looking out for you?
4,I thought the book was good!!!,"Perhaps I see things from a different perspective that the other reviewers. But, I thought the book was good. Very Good. Makes you well aware of what is going on in this world. Some of which I do not like...but, Mr. O'Reilly is telling the truth in it.Recently I have read two books that make me wonder about our society in a whole. Though they are different from one another in context, They are very much alike in asking the question ""What is going on in our world""...The second book I read is Nightmares Echo. Both books are excellent. Both books teach!!Both books make you say to yourself OMG!!!So in essence...I say this book should recieve High Recommendations!!!Oh n look its on the Best Sellers list so I may not be wrong about how I feel.Reviewer and Author"
1,Horrible,"A book designed merely to trap your mind even deeper, and tighter into the little tiny box the establishment wants you in. Give this book a pass unless you want your intelligence to suffer greatly."
1,Can dish it out but can't take it...,"O'Reilly...For all his righteous bluster and supposed lack of spin, he is obviously biased. It cracks me up that people take this guy seriously, given that unless he can cut you off he runs away like a sissy.""Shut up!"", seems to be his best way of quieting a worthy opponent. He claims that others slander or libel him when he constantly attacks and lies about those who disagree with him.He is a classic example of the right-wingnut constituency that listens to him. It is kinda sad that a man like this has any audience much less the nationwide audience Fox gives him.Buy Al Franken's book instead!"
1,Dull and Self-Serving,"O'Reilly spends more time serving his own ego and twisting facts and figures than he does trying to present valid points on important issues for America. Poorly written and at times utterly dull, this book barely deserves even one star. No-spin zone? Right, try again Bill."
1,The world revolves around...,"Bill. Everything in this world must be seen through his eyes, because only he knows the truth. Everything that he doesn't agree with is heretical, and everything he does agree with is divine. ""They"" are out to get him, and he fights ""brilliantly"" against ""Them"".(sigh) It seems that of all the virtues the shrill child O'Reilly ascribes to himself, humility and constancy were thrown out somewhere between his aggrieved childhood and his aggrieved ""adult-hood"". Spend your money on something else, unless you like hearing someone cry ""Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!""."
1,No Real Information or Insight--Disappointing,"I suppose I shouldn't really have expected a talk-show host to offer much real information on how society or life works. (After all, a talk show host is merely in the business of ENTERTAINMENT, not philosophy or sociology). Still, O'reilly is such a contorversial figure, that I decided to see what he had to say. Mostly, I found that this book consisted entirely of personal opinion, delivered forcefully, but without anything real to back it up. Disappointing in every way."
1,Awful,"Bill's overly simplistic view of America is nauseating! He pretends to be smarter than he really is, and I say pretend because it's so badly written, illogical, and overly simplistic that one has to laugh (and then cry about the money wasted on it!)."
2,Not as good at the first two,"It surprised me because he ranted about himself or his background a lot. Unlike his first two books prior it was blah. I like this guy because he is willing to confront the celibs and other powerful people out there that have lost common sense and brains but have a mic. Unfortunately, people don't like the truth which is why he is disliked. I read it in 7 days due to it being an easy read. I was hoping for more Bill."
1,Personality Disorder,"Does Mr. O'Reilly fancy himself a journalist? If he does, maybe he should get a degree in journalism and allow someone to teach him how to get out of his own way. I forced myself to get through this very odd book. I did not feel well after I was done. It gives me chills to think that there are people out there who find this man respectable.and the two"
1,Looking for intellectual material? Look elsewhere.,"Despite the fact that I have been severely disenchanted with O'Reilly's show, I decided to give his new book a chance. I was hoping that perhaps he was different in written form, not as boisterous and bullying. However, I was completely wrong. Trust me when I say that this book is filed with outrageous hyperbole, flawed logic, a hard right political slant, and flat out lies and misinformation on a host of topics. O'Reilly prides himself on being in the know, the common man, and moderate, but these claims are destroyed with anything above a casual examination of this book.Even if you are a conservative, I urge you not to purchase this book. You have every right to hold whatever opinion you want on any issue you want, but by no means should you allow yourself to be influenced by this angry, virulent, and misinformed man. There are many places to read conservative viewpoints and well thought out essays. This is not one of them."
4,Long overdue but finally available.,"It's more than about time that Peabo Bryson had a comprehensive anthology like this one (which is very good). Capitol should reissue all of his big 1970s and '80s albums including ""I Am Love"", ""Crosswinds"", ""Reaching For The Sky"" and the Roberta Flack collaboration ""Born To Love"", however."
5,Best Peabo but not All!,"This 2 CD set covers most hits from 10976-1991. It includes his pop hits Can You Stop The Rain, If Ever Your In My Arms Again, Tonight I Celebrate My Love (with Roberta Flack) and his breakthrough pop hit Lover's After All (with Melissa Manchester). It also includes his most popular soul hits like his #1 re-make of Al Wilson's Show & Tell, plus Reachin' For The Sky, Gimme Some Time (with Natalie Cole), Let The Feeling Flow and All My Love. He does the Stephanie Mills/Teddy Pendergrass clasic Feel The Fire. A remake of Doobie Brother's Minute By Minute and a mediocre version of Janis Joplin's Piece Of My Heart (which was not even a chart hit for him!). I would have liked to see other cuts like his first chart hit Do It With Feeling (with Michael Zager) and Take No Prisoners. This set will compliment his Columbia Greatest Hits collection. Don't forget his hit with Kenny G, By The Time This Night Is Over on Kenny's Hits CD! Complete!"
3,"Pretty good, but go seem them live","I saw The Grates with The Go! Team, another band who sound sublime live but didn't produce or mix their album up to it's potential. The Grates show was very impressive and the Seattle crowd were probably more thrilled with them than the other bands that night. Some of their songs kind of fall into that Roger's Sisters, Pylon-ish post punk sound and they also have a few sweet and tender pop numbers too. The lead singer and drummer are both very fun to watch and all their songs sounded good that night at The Showbox. Alas, I didn't think this EP was particularly good. I think they should have traded production styles with the Go! Team. This Grates ep could have been rawer and lower fi whereas The Go! Team album needed more polish. I will still try The Grates full length when it comes out. Hopefully that lives up to their fun show!Best tracks on this EP: Sukkafish, TrampolineWorst: The other two"
3,Delicate - May not survive shipping,"Nothing wrong with the product, but I ignored other reviews of this and similar products which stated that after shipping all the rails of nails were broken apart and unusable.This is exactly what happened to me with this item. Since the other review was 2 years earlier, it is clear nothing has been done to improve this situation.I returned them, and will buy locally."

4,Good 'ol rock 'n roll,"Saw these guys open for the somewhat-legendary Pixies around 1990. I was unfamiliar with both bands but definitely liked the Zulus' set better. This album has a great song (""Never Again"") that would have made a nice single -- actually may have been ahead of its time. ""Big D"" is kind of slow, but the other tracks are unpretentious, slightly-alternative, straight-ahead rock. They don't take a lot of chances or experiment overly much in them, but this is a very solid effort for what I think was a debut album. Good tunes to exercise with!"
5,Just another band out of Boston?,"I grew up in Seattle in the late eighties early nineties and this was one of the bands that made alot of bands step up their game. If it wasn't for bands like this, left of the dial. I would have jammed pencils thru my eardrums."
5,Buy this album now!,"Kat Eggleston is a brilliant and thoughtful songwriter with an amazing voice and rock-solid musical talent. She is capable of going from a lyrical tribute to the powers of Nature to heal and bring perspective ('Go the the Water'), to vivid and extremely disturbing portraits of abuse and pathology ('No Laughing Matter' and 'Mirror, Mirror'), to the, bar none, sexiest song I have ever heard ('Outside Eden'). Her songwriting is vivid, subtle, funny, and provocative. Her voice is clear and lovely and she is a sure and deft musician. I listen to this album over and over and discover something new each time. I cannot recomend it enough to people who are captivated by the combination of exceptional writing with superb musicianship."
3,Vornado humidifier average,"This is the 2nd Vornado product I have purchased. Very happy with the floor fan. This humidifier is only average, however. The filter was dirty within one week's time. Too costly to operate with the necessary change of filters. Will return."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"When this humidifier is running on high, it is so loud you can't be in the same room and talk on the phone or listen to TV or music unless you raise the volume. A neighbor stopped over and after in the house only a minute she said,""WHAT is that noise?"".It also makes popping noises every 45 min to hour as the water drains out of the water holding tank. The first time I heard it I thought someone was knocking on our front door. The first time my husband heard it he said, ""What the he-- is that!"". If that is not bad enough, when the unit runs out of water there is no indicator light and it does not shut off...it just keeps running and running. Also, you cannot move the unit until all the water is empty. If you need to move it to vacuum or wash the floor, good luck because the vents on the bottom part where the water is are very low on the unit and the water comes sloshing out out all over. Cannot believe the incredibly poor design from a company that makes great fans."
4,It really works!!,It really makes a differnce to the dry wintery room. No more dry skin and throat!!
1,Buy something else,"We bought a basic Vick Humidifier..., but once I saw this one on Amazon, I bought it because of the Vornado. Well, they make great fans, but this thing [stinks]. The water tank makes A LOT of noise during the night while you are trying to sleep. Before the end of the first night, we unplugged and packed it back up to reutrn. We kept the Vicks..."
2,Would be great but one big flaw,"I bought this unit to help humidify my bedroom. Normal operation is nice and quiet and yet still seems to dump a good amount of water into the room.The way the unit stores the water is in a big bottle on the side. The bottle feeds into the base of the unit and there is enough water in the bottom of the unit to keep the entire bottle from dumping out all at once. This provides a convenient way for you to refill the humidifier.HOWEVER, when the water level drops enough that water is fed from the bottle there is a LOUD burbling sound as air replaces the water in the tank. This sound is loud enough to wake me from a sound sleep."
3,Good but not quiet,"I bought two of these because the reviewers here gave it good marks and downplayed the noise it made. This product is easy to assemble and clean. Filling the water chamber is very easy compared to other humidifiers I have used. To me it is the best feature. My main gripe is with the noise it makes. First of all, the fan is not as quiet as I had hoped. There are three fan speeds, but the lowest speed is the only one that has an acceptable sound level at night. The higher two are only useful during the day when it can be drowned out by other household noises. To make matters worse, every 2 hours or so, this humidifier makes a series of loud GULPs as the water from the tank drains into the humidifier base. Based on the reviews I read here, I didn't think it would be a problem because I am a heavy sleeper, so I was suprised that the GULPing noise wakes me up at night.This is a fine product for the daytime, but for nighttime/sleeptime, I wish I had purchased something else."
4,VERY basic but functional humidifier,"Very basic unit. There are only 3 pieces. The top with fan, the bottom, and the glug glug water jug that looks like a WWII bedpan. It doesn't get any simpler than this. Very quiet and quite effective at its job.One of the things I forgot to think about before I bought htis was whether or not I wanted to be turning it off and on every time the need arose. Argh.It has no humidity sensor so you will be turning off and on yourself when the windows start to drip on the inside and when your throat feels hoarse. If I had to buy again, I'd go for a model with that sensor."
5,Happy Customer,After a lot of research and also owning several other vornado products i picked this once. Very happy once again! very QUITE! looks nice! easy to clean and move around the house.
2,Cheap construction and not very effective,"I guess I expected too much from this extremely basic designed humidifier. I have never felt that it was very effective at humidifying my room, which is a bit large. I ended up buying an air-o-swiss instead. You do get what you pay for."
3,voronado review,"The humidifier produces an invisible mist into the air, which you can't notice the humidity unless the unit is on HIGH for a long period of time.The unit makes gulping type noises as it retrieves water from the water container which is both disturbing and creepy in the middle of the night.I had also hoped that the unit would be the kind that produced a visible steamlike mist, this doesn't.Lastly, i only used the unit for approximately 4 weeks and already had mold growing on the filter while leaving the unit on 24 hours a day on low.The price of the unit and filters are very reasonable if you need to add humidity to a very small room."
2,Just isnt enough,I thought this game was gonna be alot more. And it isnt that the concept is hard. As a previous reviewer said there isnt much reason for a person to keep going. except to unlock different wallpapers and songs. The music is cool and the graphics are ok for a puzzle game. Theres just to many other good puzzle games out there for the ds to recomend this. And with many more on the way.
2,not fun,This game was not as much fun as I thought it would be. It seems a little difficult to move the combs and make the levels disappear.
4,Great Piece of Machinery,"This is a fine tool. Good balance, fits into tight spots, no problems after two solid years of use. I do ""hysteric preservation"" (fixing old houses that all to often should go in dumpsters) where nothing is on 16"" centers and tight spots abound.I'm prone to over-construction so full head nails are a must and I even use galvanized ring shank nails for interior work. The coils do have to be protected. I received one box from the Tool Crib the entire contents of which had been made square by rough handling, but that is a warehouse or shipping problem. Order ahead and keep an inventory of what you will use. I even have them shipped directly to jobs out of state.Would be five star except Senco provides no case. I e'mailed them and they confirmed this without suggestion. Took a year to find that a 40mm ammo can (48 cartridge) with a little rigid insulation works fine.Keep it clean, keep it oiled. I look forward to years of good service."
2,Disspointed,"Had problems right off. After one use hammer hung up in cocked position. Had to disassemble head to push piston down.(Maybe that's why they give you a allen wrench with it). Unit will not always advance nail, get a lot of blank shots in vertical and overhead positions. Using air tool oil after every use. Have to bang repeatedly on unit to get it to start to operate or remove head if unit is really stubborn. Can't let it sit up long. Have to go through extensive frustration to get working. Unit was highly recomended. If I had to do it over, would not buy."
2,Bad cd tracks,"I've been working through this book for about a year, way to long. Imade up my mind to complete it, that may have been a mistake. I like thecord arrangements, that's a plus...trying to follow along with the cdtracks will drive you crazy..why?? do you muddle up the tracks withover bearing horns, drums, ect..I don't get it! Also he could have slowedthings down a little..the changes are way to fast, all of this should havedone better...."
2,"OK, but look elsewhere","Misleading description that this book contains 99 or even 40 classics. The tunes it says it includes are often just the changes with a sample solo, but I would not say that it really contains the tune. Actually even the changes are often not the complete tune. Probably a beginner studying this in depth might get something out of it. But if you are like me and a intermediate to advanced player, this just seems like a hodge-podge of stuff everyone already knows and not very well put together."
2,way too much,I took a quick glimpse of this book right when i got it and I knew that there was way too much info. The first couple of pages gave you a whole bunch of chords go learn and memorize before you get to the next page. This would be a good book to look back on later on. But if you are a beginner this isnt the book for you.
5,Supreme knowledge,"Waldin's knowledge of his subject is immense but conveyed with an ease.He is clearly no stooge to the grand marques and is forthright in his opinions without being pompous.Whether you're a wine lover or merely someone that loves the countryside, this book is really all you'll need for a terrific week in Bordeaux."
3,Advertised Condition of Book in Question,"My purchase was advertised as ""new"" condition, which I suppose is relative for a book that was published in 2006. However, I question the storage of the book, which directly impacted its condition. The actual book I received was hardly pristine. The cover has impressions in it, and the pages are slightly discolored. The book also has a noticably musty smell. While none of this affects the readability, I do feel a bit deceived by the seller. Sure, not enough to return the book and request my money back, but enough to ensure I'm more careful about 3rd party sellers through the Amazon network. As for the content of the book, it's a wonderful resource for anyone looking to assist in researching what to do on their trip to the Bordeaux region."
4,Nice improvement over my older Sangean,I'm pleased with the ATS-818xxx ... it is a nice improvement over the older model that I had for years. Among other improvements is increased sensitivity.
2,Selectric II element review,"Unfortunately, the element I received does not work. It will not stay in place, so it can't be used. And also unfortunately, it would cost as much to send it back as it did to purchase it. So I'm just SOL.In the long run, I'll buy a new one instead of a used one. I wanted to see if it was the element I have that isn't working properly or the typewriter itself, so I bought the used one. I still don't know."
1,fiddle sitar,"Shujjhat khan is an brilliant artist, he truly compensates for his lack of classical hindustani music training by playing catch phrases of ragas and joining them with vocals. Yes it is elevator music compared to Pandit Ravi Shankar, however one must keep in mind before listining to Shujjhat that they are not to expect to hear a serious classical version of a raaga,but rather a short folk melody. I purchased a album from Amazon which I reccomend to all music lovers of an artist named Ustad Shahid Pervez Khan Saheb which was simply superb. Shahid Pervez is known in India along with Pandit Ravi Shankar as the greatest living sitarist."
1,Amateur,"Shujjhat did well for a musician not having classical Indian musical training. Shujjhat is good to listen to when you dont feel like getting into listing to heavy hindustani sangeet. I purchased this album to play during cocktail parties. One shoudnt make the mistake of juxtaposing Shujjhats music with classical heavies such as Ravi Shankar or Shahid Pervez,its like comparing kenny G with John Coltrain. Its a great coffeshop album"
1,NON INFORMATIONAL,"These videos are absolutely no help. I didn't learn anything from these, it was pretty much common sense. He just tattooed and didn't explain the techniques. These are not informational or how-to DVD's. Do not waste your money!"
2,Yes!,"This is a good chess set for the price. The only thing messed up is the codeing is on the wrong line. When you set up a chess board the white square is on the right. If you ues the codes, KN1 to KB3, they are maked incorrectly on the board."
1,Board does not even qualify to be a board,"This board is about the thickness of cereal box cardboard. Very warped and will not straighten, not even with an iron - totally useless - do not buy unless you just want the classic cheap pieces."
3,Suitable for the Money,"I purchased several of these for a kids' chess club and they work just fine. I did not find them to be as flimsy as cereal boxes, as another reviewer claims. The board doesn't always lie entirely flat until after a few rounds of play, but they fold down to be very small, so for a chess club, they work great. They are suitable enough for casual play and work well for teaching kids."
4,Not bad for the price.,"This is about as basic of a set you can get, but worth it for the price. Great for beginners."
5,kachoo,"have had this brad shooter for a couple of weeks, and have had no ploblems at all. i've been pinning 3/4 inch 13 ply baltic birch plywood together for a cabinet building project, using 1 3/16"" brads at 80psi. never having owned a nail gun before, i just bought this one due to the reviews on amazon and of course seeing one in person on new yankee workshop. i probably could have gotten cheaper or other brand, but i am happy with my decision to buy here on amazon."
3,Bad day in Hawaii Nei,"I ordered this as a replacement for the Accuset Combo Stapler/Brad Nailer 910002N and discovered that the stiff safety mechanism, which is similar to the Accuset, causes marring and won't accept a no-mar tip. I'm mainly using the brad nailer for rather soft redwood paneling and trim. Senco Tech Support advised me to send it back to Toolcrib and exchange it for the new FP25 which has a no-mar tip and different safety. I declined to consider disabling the safety on the SLP20. If the FP25 is anywhere close in sweetness to the old Italian made Senco pin nailer I'll be a happy Hawaiian."
3,Not waht the Picture Shows,"The picture is totally misleading.Besides been made in china.Body color is diferent and the exaust cup is red.works ok but is not waht's on the picture,that shows the late 80's model.too much money for not been the real mckoy"
3,Not used to setting nails,I bought this gun with no research and found it lacking in power. (my other Senco guns work great) It will not drive an 1-5/8 inch brad into pine fully at 80 psi. There should be an adjustment for drive depth like other nail guns.
3,Not so great picture quailty..,The picture quality of this TV was horrible. It has all the great feature but 20 day's later the newer model the 32HFX72 came out and is better & also cheaper!!! What a crock! I'm not pleased w/ this TV. The Progressive Scan from my DVD player to this TV looks worse than my RCA hook up to my 5yr old TV!!
4,One wonderful song after another,"Ivan Lins has become my favorite 'go-to' music in the last months since I fully discovered his work. I have 4 or 5 of his CDs and love them all. This one has a mix of songs sung in his native tongue and then also some in English. His harmonies are always incredible, especially in the ballads, or slower songs.Another winner of an album!"
3,A little small for the money...,"We just got this a few days ago. I had a globe as a kid, so perhaps my criticism is based on my comparisson to it. Note: the globe itself is not 12 inches. It's 12 inches from its base to the very top. I just think it could've been bigger. Had the globe itself been 12"", I'd probably be more happy with it. I'd still recommend it, however, as I assume it's not posssible to get anything bgetter in this price range whitch is plenty for a globe."
4,I love it.,It was a favorite of my husband'. He had this album when he was a teen and I bought it for him as a gift...he loves it!!
5,Classic Kinks,One of the best non-concept album put out by the Kinks. They were in transition from a singles group to a more FM oriented album sound. Then came the concept albums and we all know the rest of the story.
2,a star for each song I liked,"I was expecting more, but found I was not that big of fan. Liked 2 songs. I will trade mine for a diet coke if anyone is interested?"
1,very disappointing....,"received Muswell Hillbillies and this drivel a week or 2 ago.Some albums take time to grow on you-but this one just will not take. There is absolutely no comparison between the Kinks and Beatles/Stones here. Muswell is thoroughly enjoyable- sort of an Exile on Main St. kind of elegantly wastedness on a porch in West Virginia. This has the sound of a band who just listened to Lady Jane by the Stones, and decided to make a full album over the next two days-just like it. Light folly- envision them in short-pants and black knee-socks A period piece indeed, but a very early period. The perfect album to collect dust.You may listen to it once. I'd like to hear ""Something Else"" by the Kinks..."
1,the beginning of the end,"Besides ""David Watts,"" there isn't a listenable song on this album. And that's coming from a big Kinks' fan. Like many great ""artists"" of the 60's, Ray Davies took his cue from Dylan and Lennon/McCartney and decided to become a poet rather than a musician. What a shame. Boring, boring, boring. And pretentious to boot."
5,Absolutely essential.,"The Kinks are probably the most under-appreciated band in exsistence. They were unquestionably the most British of all of the bands of the British invasion, but were kept out of America due to orders by the American Federation of Musicians. Had they have had the exposure back then, they would be as popular as the Beatles. Buy this album for Waterloo Sunset, the song that Robert Christgau called ""the most beautiful song in the English language."""
2,Five star album -- but where are my bonus tracks?,"I don't have anything to say about this album that hasn't been said. I just to warn buyers that my copy of this CD states on the liner notes that it has 8 bonus tracks, but said tracks are not on the disc. This doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the core album -- which sounds great -- but is very disappointing overall."
3,Picture discs,"This record is without a doubt one of the best Kinks albums. The sound on this disc is alright, although the bass is noticeably and unnecessarily boosted, which makes the record sound a bit uneven. The description does NOT state this is a picture disc, so I was quite suprised when it arrived in the mail. I find picture discs to be a bit atroicious myself and certainly do no appreciate the cheap plastic which contains it. The songs on the record are an entirely different story, though unfortunately they are held back by being presented in such a worthless medium. Lets hope it gets the release it deserves in the near future."
1,Damaged merchandise,"I am so dissapointed to have received such a piece of damaged garbage.,This is a 2 CD set, the second one is so badly scratched and damaged it won't even play at all.. what a waste of MY MONEY!"
2,umm.........,"I think this cd was kindof a dissapointment. Fo one thing, the dc talk song there. I ean, that song is ok but it was made in 1998. And the P.O.D. song? They should hve put more rocky songs on this cd. This cd is 2001's most forgotten hits to me. I mean,they could have at least put a better P.O.D. song on it. P.O.D. is second favorite band. And whenIheard they were on it, i was s excited. Then i got really mad when i heard it. I think wow 2002 is the best ne yet. I'm not sure about 2003 because i haven't heard it yet."
5,BEST WOW COLLECTION YET!!,I have had this album for a few weeks now. This is absolutely the best WOW album that has been produced. There is a great variety of the popular and not-so-popular bands. This is definately a great choice for the young adults out there.
4,WOW- Christian Series,"I have this CD already- what I was looking for on this one song ""God of Wonders"" City on a Hill; is the Words to this song. The package insert does not have each song because this package contains two Christian CD's-- Now that's really a WOW! However, I really need to get this one (1) song's words. Just guess I have to keep on searching...thank you...God Bless! :o)"
5,great mix of all different flavors...,"this just about sums up all the best songs from just about all of the CDs i want. well, now i only have to get one!"
2,"2 1/2 The Music is OK, But.....","I ws looking at the cover of my mom's WOW 2001, and then I looked at the track listing. Then it hit me, something is wrong here. On the front it says, ""The Year's 30 Top Chrisitan Arists & Hits."" If you're going to be honest, call it The 30 best CCM (emphasized) hits. The hardest it gets is POD & Earthsuit. The two from them are ulrta-calm considering the rest of the albums that they came off of.Maybe they could sneak in ""Treasure"" from tree63, the 2000 Dove Rock Album of the Year winners.(its really pretty soft, though) How about something from Pillar's ""Above,"" 2000 Hard Rock CD of the year? How about something like ""Unsaid"" from MXPX's ""The Ever-Passing Moment.""MORE ROCK TRACKS, & THESE WILL MAKE MY WISH LIST!!!-christianrockfreak"
5,The 3rd Dalziel and Pascoe novel,"Having renewed his relationship with college girlfriend Ellie Soper, Detective Peter Pascoe re-establishes contact with other school friends, who invite Ellie and Peter to spend a long weekend in the country with them. Work detains Peter, so that when Ellie and Peter arrive at the cottage, they find all their frinds brutally murdered, except for their host, who is missing.Peter is out of his jurisdiction and on the other side of the witness table, trying desperately to convince his colleagues that his friend can't be the murderer.Meanwhile Ellie does some investigating of her own, in which she finds an unexpected ally, the cop she detests, Superintendent Andy Dalziel.If you have enjoyed later Dalziel and Pascoe books, don't miss this earlier effort. There are some great character developing scenes in this book, especially for Ellie and Dalziel."
5,Indestructible UNO!,"UNO may be my favorite card game ever. I've worn down several UNO decks and this was the answer to my vigorous UNO habit. The deck is made of plastic with its original intent to be water-proof (which it is) but it also makes the deck extremely durable. This alone made me buy this deck but when I got it, the design on the cards is very flashy and nice! Myself and all my buddies really enjoyed playing with these cards as they looked great. The only complaint I have is the additional rule with this deck and the ""mini eight ball"" it comes with (for the additional rule) is very disappointing. Doesn't really add a good variation to the game."
1,Problem Player.,The only thing this player has going is that it plays VCDs. Half of my dvd collcetion (60) will not play on this bug-ladden player. And they are all region free discs! You will not get much help from the folks at the RCA custmer service website. Avoid this player like the plague. I had to give this player 1 star because you can't leave a zero.
1,Thompson Electronics,"This item is made by Thompson Electronics along with those carrying the GE name tag. My GE DVD player mo.#1101P lasted a little over a year before breaking down and full-exchange warranties for this brand is 90 days. After that you pay labor i.e. your better off buying a new unit! The moral of the story; go with better name brands that have longevity. My Onkyo CD player is over 8 years old and works great still, including the ability to play CD-R's that weren't even around back when this unit was made. Quality + duration is true value!"
2,Technical Specs Data is not correct,"I purchased this unit as a Gift for my daughters Birthday, she lives in Trenton, GA. Technical data (obtained from Amazon.com) said that it would play ""DVD-Video (NTSC), VCD, CD, CD-R, CD-RW, VCD, DVD-R, DVD+RW, DVD+R, MP3-CD, JPEG CD; 8 and 12 cm discs"". It will Play DVD-Video with good results. It does not play DVD+R. I transfered several VCR Tapes to DVD+R for her to see. They Play on my computer and my DVD Player. They will not play on the RCA DRC220N DVD Player I bought for her! I will never buy Electronic items from a ""Book Store again""!!!!"
1,This product never worked properly!,This DVD player is from a well known brand. I expected it to work at least once but it failed to play DVDs from day one. I will avoid all RCA products in the future.
2,"Good features, buggy player","This player has some good features like disc memory, but that falls short of it's downside: it won't play very many discs all the way through. Many discs will pause for a few seconds or stop playing. You have to rewind the player prior to the point of the pause then let it play. At that point it will play fine. That gets really annoying when you have to do it 3-4 times during a movie. Like others I thought that it was the disc, but after a trip home and playing some dvd's there then on this player I realized it was the player, not the discs.I purchased this one for about $80.00 and feel very ripped off. I just got a Memorex dvd player from Kmart for 35.00 and it beats the RCA player hands down. Avoid this one."
2,Poor remote idea,"The remote is dedicated to the player. This means the remote that comes with it is the only one that will work on it. The salesman said that it is a digital remote and that is why. I know this because the remote stopped working and I can't get another to control it. This means that if I want to control my perfectly good dvd player I need to get a new dvd player. Yes, I am lazy and don't want to have to get up to do ANYTHING with the player, that is what the remote is for! Know this if you are looking at this dvd player."
1,JPEG FILES WON'T PLAY,I bought the RCA DRC220N to convienietly display my digital photography. While the player does play my .mp3 tracks and burned CD's it will not read .jpg files. I had to explain to the technical support person at RCA what a JPEG file was so I knew I was in trouble. A slip of paper inserted in the box says that some large .jpg files may be to big to play. So I tried reading a small 20kb picture file on a CD with no results. I can't recommend this unit if you want to display your digital photography easily. RCA needs to beef up its technical trouble shooters especially when they make you pay a long distance phone call for poor support.
1,Piece of Junk,I have had the RCA DRC220N for less than 6 months and now it will not turn on. RCA web site is not any help. I'm staying away from RCA in the future.
4,growing up includes being responsible,"being read this book as a child was simple fun, and went along with my parents encouraging me to be responsible.as a parent I wanted my kids to realize that others were hurt by our unthinking selfishness.It seems now that I'm older that the lesson, of doing only what WE want can spill the cargo of our family that we carry through life with us, is still valid.That everyone in town is rooting for me to do what is right, and cheers when I'm successful, is what I wish to believe."
5,Can't grow themselves,"A wonderful classic, with a very necessary lesson: left to their own devices, our precious children are not capable of raising themselves. Hands-off, permissive parenting has a history of producing irresponsible, self-centered children. Obedience, respect, responsibility and the ability to make right decisions don't come naturally to any child. In the end, Tootle learns the right response, due to the intentional involvement of people who care enough to discipline him. Order a whole case of these for all new parents!!!"
5,value for the addict!,"i had grown up enjoying the story of Tootle - my parents read it to me as i went to bed. i enjoyed the colorful pictures and the valuable lesson. little did i realize how powerful a lesson it truly had.many people don't like the story of Tootle because they think it's about conforming to rules and doing what other people tell you to do. on the surface, that is what the story appears to be about, but it actually goes much deeper.Tootle is a story about dealing with addiction. although Tootle is having fun, he is enjoying an addictive behavior - going where he is not designed to go. he continues to have this problem, and only with the help of the villiage does he overcome his addiction. anyone who has ever dealt with an addiction will be able to identify the powerful message of this book."
5,choo choo!,"Tootle is the tootlest, haha. That means he's radically cool for your kids!This book will provide adventure, laughter, a thrilling story and... will ultimately make your child happy and fill his imagination with plenty of colorful thoughts and images. I highly recommend it. Read it to your kids before bedtime and watch their eyes light up with excitement. This is one train that's destined for the right reaction as the adorable train races around mountains and through country areas with an ongoing desire for success! Choo choo!!!"
5,Tootle Golden Book,"Gave this as a gift to co-worker's son for Christmas...He loved it, I had the same book when I was growing up in the 1950's."
4,great for train obsessed toddler,my son liked that the story was about a little train but i was meh on the message-- essentially that it's better to stay on the track and do what you're told. otherwise the illustrations are great. there are several pages where there is a lot of writing and my son almost always wants to skip ahead. i've taken to summarizing those pages when i read the story aloud.
2,Reflects the priorities of our mindless educational system,"May I recommend anyone interested in the book to read Nicholas C. Burbules (1986) study of this book entitled ""Tootle: A Parable of Schooling and Destiny"" found in Harvard Educational Review, 56 (3), pp. 239-256. Shades of current ""no child left behind"" policies can be clearly seen. ""Learning means listening and remembering. This learning can be quantifiably measured and compared."" Why is it wrong for Tootle to be happy after talking with the horse or smelling the flowers? Obedience to society is the key to success for Tootle. Is this always the message that we want to instill in our children? In the ""happy ending"", the kindly old teacher Bill has connived to make the meadow miserable for Tootle, who in turn feels gratitude to Bill for saving him - for his own good, of course. Is mindless conformity the educational priority that we want for our children?"
1,There are thousands of better children's books,"This book was written in 1945. I think all the good writers must have been off fighting the war, and the person left to write this wrote a mindless story about some severely twisted 1945ish view of how children should behave. The moral of the story is ""stay on the tracks"". Mindlessly do what you are told. Do not smell the flowers. This book might possibly be of benefit to some children, but only read it to them after consulting with a psychiatrist. Otherwise you might harm your child. There are dozens of better books about trains."
1,Horrid!!!,"This book is terrible!! If you want to raise a mindless child who follows all the rules without thinking, but if you want to raise a thinking child who understands that there are *reasons* you don't do certain things then this book is not for you! There is no reason at all given for why Tootle must stay on the track other than it is what trains do. So poor Tootle is forced onto the tracks even though he is hurting nothing at all by taking an occasional jaunt in the meadow as he loves to do. My son (almost 4) likes the book, but he indiscriminately loves any book about trains. This book makes me cringe just to look at it and I almost cry everytime I read it. I suspect we will ""lose"" it very soon."
3,Beware the Red Flags!,"As a non-comformist, I was mortified the first time I read this book as an adult (over 10 years ago). I immediately looked at the original year it was published-- 1945. Smack in the McCarthy Era. No wonder! Red flags? Stay on the track? Ironically, I now have two preschoolers who love this book. I keep it around so we can eventually have a discussion about its messages. How does one start a discussion with small children about McCarthyism vs. anarchy? I give this book three stars because on one hand, I want to give it 0 for squashing the non-conformist hero, and on the other hand, I want to give it 5 for great illustrations (a train frolicking in a field of wildflowers!), the pink cover, and debate-worthy historical/ philosophical elements. . ."
3,A little too late,"There are indeed some good things here. The pianist: excellent. The sound: excellent. The songs: excellent. Birgit Nilsson: Acceptable, interesting. But she is too often out of pitch. This recording was made a little too late in her illustrious career. There is a wonderful disc with Scandinavian songs on Decca, with Nilsson in top form. Strongly recommended!"
1,and don't buy this one either,See the review for CD of Shakespeare Musick (Musicians of the Globe). My nonreturnablecopies will donated to my local library. Don't decide to buy this product unless you'veheard the entire CD.
5,"A great strip, a great book!","Two reasons why I appreciate this strip so much: a) I vaguely remember being Jeremy's age and b) I have a son. Now he's in the &#65533;Baby Blues&#65533; age - one reason why I don't find that strip so funny - but I can sympathise with all the strip's characters. So I get amused, inspired and also touched. The stories are very human, they don't degrade any of the generations, they are well drawn. Book 2 is in every way as good as book 1. I hope it continues that way."
5,john williams gem,"Many dump on poor John Williams, though he is justifiably the king of film scores of the last 35 years. Besides his scores for the Spielberg/Lucas blockbusters, he has written fine scores for smaller films, one being Angela's Ashes and this score to the Lawrence Kasdan film. Williams' score is quiet and emotional and perfectly serves the film. Long live the King!"
4,SUPERB SMOOTH JAZZ,REMINDS ME OF THE SOFTER SIDE OF 3RD fORCE and SPYRO GYRA.VERY SMOOTH JAZZ WITH NO VOCALS OR SURPRISES.
5,Amazing!!!!!!,This book is the best book I have ever read I read it all the time. It speaks to me because I'm like Cole and Peter combined
3,newatreview,"This is a great book for youthful readers and some adults, especially teachers of middle school students, will probably like it too."
5,Touching Spirit Bear,"Touching Spirit Bear is about a troubled 15-year old boy named Cole. His parents are alcoholics and abuse him. After he hurts Pete, he is sent to a remote island in Alaska. He has a near death experience and realizes all the things he did wrong in his life. I read the whole book in 4 1/2 hours nonstop. I think this book not only shows how Cole changed but it shows how people with many troubles can change. I think this book shows a valuable lesson about life. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read about adventure, courage, and life. This book definitely deserves a five star rating!"
4,Touching Spirit Bear,From an Elementary Student in my class:This book is about a kid named Cole. He was a very mean person who got in trouble for beating a kid up. Coles' parents were very mean and were drunks. So he found Circle Justice. He went to an island where he was mauled by a Spirit Bear. I recommend this book because it has a little gore and tells about a troubled kid's life.
4,What I think about this book,"I think this book is very interesting. Honestly I have hard time usually finishing a book but, this book kept my interest. I especially love how it eneded and the two boys united. This book shows that people need to look deeper into their life before making major mistakes."
3,spirit bear review,"The book touching spirit bear is an all right book. It was ok because I just wasn't able to focus on it. It just didn't grab my attention well enough. The conflict in the story was his anger. He solved his anger problem by getting sent to the island. The island changed his life by teaching him there is more to life than just fighting. He first showed his anger by beating the crap out of Peter, so he got sent to an island in Alaska. It was a huge island with a big lake. It rained a lot there. He also ran into the legendary White spirit bear. He got mad at it because it wasn't scared of him, so he tried to kill it, but it almost killed him instead. Then for a couple of days the bear came back, and just looked at him. It was weird because it didn't attack him it just stared at him. But anyway he got rescued and he had to go back to the island to fix what he messed up. When he got there Peter was there because he tried to commit suicide twice. But anyway out of 5 stars I give it a 3."
4,How Nature Can Change Hatred!!!,"The protagonist, Cole Matthews, was sent to a Native American Circle Justice after smashing Peter Driscal's head into the sidewalk. Now Cole has to survive in the treacherous state in an isolated island. The plot is a very dramatic experience! Will he survive after being attacked by 700 pound monsterous bear?!?!?! And will he change his way of living? Find out by reading this virtuous book by Ben Mikaelsen!!!"
5,Touching Spirt Bear,Touching Spirt Bear is one of the best books i have read in a long time. i liked how Cole almost fixed all of his problems. i would rate the books 100 stars if i could.
2,Touching Spirit Bear,Cole Matthews is the main character. Cole brutally attacking a classnate. And him touching spirit bear and geting hurt and hit by him. The major problem is cole geting in to trouble and getting attacted by the bear. And the major lesson is to be kind and you dont have to use physical violence or fighting to solve a problem or issuse with someone. My disappointment is that the kid Cole doesnt get into any fights in the story. What I would change is almost at the end Were Cole gets attacked by spirit bear; he wins. I chose this book because he attacked someone.
1,Terrible Book,"The novel Touching Spirit Bear is about Cole Matthews, a boy who beat up Peter Driscal to a point where he had permanent brain damage, and how he goes to an island as a punishment. Throughout the book Cole goes through exciting problems that apparently help him. For instance, Cole gets mauled by the Spirit Bear. After he got mauled another 6 chapters was dedicated to what was happening to him as he was lying on the ground almost dead. After he was rescued from the mauling he had an un-realistic change in personality. He, all of a sudden, wanted to help Peter and other people. The book dragged out what happened to Cole and had over-specific details stating what happened. It has un-realistic consequences to what happens to people when they do something bad. It can teach children that if they do do something bad, they can get different consequences for what they did, even though it was wrong. Do not read this book."
1,touching spirit bear,"touching spirit bear was one of my most favorite books in all times.cole matthews,peter driscal,and garvey are the main characters.what happens is cole has the potential to beat up peter,and has to go to an island in southeast alaska. if you want to find out how this wonderful book ends you will have to read it.trust me you will love it."
4,Will they read it?,"This is an interesting book, there is no doubt about that. Reading about Cole dealing with his all-consuming anger is fascinating - and it seems real. There are times when the book gets a bit too preachy, but that is real life, too - I hear teachers and parents preaching like that to their kids all of the time.The question I have, though, is will the kids who need this most ever read it? While it can certainly help other kids (and people who deal with kids) understand the most violent and conning teens around them, can it help the cons themselves? Maybe. I hope so. It is certainly a fresh look at the problem."
5,Touching Spirit Bear by Ben Mikaelson,"I enjoyed this book, even though parts of it were very disgusting--I hate mice and I had a hard time reading about him surviving by eating a live mouse, but that didn't stop me from wanting to know what happened next."
3,Touching Spirit Bear by paul slay,Hey my name is PJ and I would like to tell about the book Touching Spirit Bear it was a good book. The setting happens in some where in alaska.The book is about a boy Cole Matthews who beats up a boy Peter Driscal. Then he goes to a juvenile place which he dosn't like.Then he gets put on an island for his punishment .When he is on the island he burns the cot he is livin in and tries to escape.When he see's a bear which tears him up and leaves him on the bank mauled.After about two months later he gets put back on an island after he gets doctored up.Then the boy he beats up gets put on the island with Cole and if you to get the rest youll just have to read the book.
1,a review,i thought that ths book was terrible and I hated it. It was really hard to finish because it didnt make any sense
5,An Awsome Book,"At the beginning, Cole was in the boat taking him to jail, the island. There were two men accompanying him. The reason he went to jail is he smashed Peter Driscal's skull into the sidewalk. He had to go to Circle Justice to talk about his sentence. They left Cole at the island, and every once in awhile they sent him supplies. Cole tried to escape to a new island. Then Peter came to visit him, and they became friends. The Spirit Bear, as the man said, was trying to be helpful. But Cole was trying to kill the bear. After he tried, the bear attacked him. We would recommend the book because it is interesting, interactive, and adventurous.by:Jonathon Stiggins,and Derik Jensen"
5,What I think about touching spirit bear,I am reviewing the book touching spirit bear. This book was a very enjoyable experience for me. I liked to read about this boy's problems and have an understanding of where he was coming from. My favorite chapter would have to be chapter 8. After the bear attacked him. He then realized what he had did and started to respect things in life. I think this book would be acceptable for kids in 6th to 11th grade.
3,touching spirt bear review,"This book is about a kid named Cole that gets in trouble because he beat up a kid named Peter. to pay for what he had done, Cole hade to chose between jail or the island, either one he would have to learn disaplan. He chose the island cause he knew how bad jail was, so he figured the island would be better.i thought the book was kind of pointless,on the island there was a spirt bear and it suposly injured Cole badly what i thought how can a spirt bear hurt a kid? or was it real? i dont know.it reated the book at # 3 cause it kind of seemed like a real boring book.but i did not give it a 1 or 2 cause some parts were not that boring.I think this book can relate to bad kids if some of them read books.I think my favorit part of the book was at the end, when Peter was beting up Cole and Cole did not fight back, that defentaly showed that Cole has changed.i would give this book a grade C.Natalie Gosnell"
5,A great story!,"This is a great story. It seems like Circle Justice could benefit many of our troubled youth, certainly better than our current system for teaching respect and accountability. My sons have both enjoyed this book and many others by this author. For instance, Petey is a must read for all ages!"
5,touching spirit bear,"I read this book with my son, who is 12, and we both really liked it. I can't wait to read the sequel. It is too bad we don't have this type of justice for our youth. Learning to be self reliant and also spending a whole lot of alone time is needed in this day and age of electronics and fast life. It was a great book for a 40ish age person. Could be and should be read to all teenagers.....Could have gone without the mouse part. yikes. :0"
5,Good Quick Read,"This book is about an angry kid with an alcoholic father named Cole who is abused and beats up a kid named Peter. Cole has to live on an Alaskan island by himself as part of Circle Justice. He changes with some wise help along with this experience on the island. I got into this book from the beginning! It's a page turner with a somewhat predictable ending, but a good read!"
4,Touching Spirit Bear,"In this book Cole who is a teenager is always involved in crime. But this time he has gone to far. He was bragging at school about one of his crimes, and Peter Discral (a guy in his class) tells the police. Cole finds out and smashes Peter into the sidewalk Peter almost suffered permanent brain damage. Cole is in deep trouble. They give Cole two choices, number one to go to real prison, number two to join the Circle Justice, the Circle Justice is based on Native American tradition where they send him to a desolate island for a year to survive on his own. He tries to escape the first time but almost kills himself in the process. They come back to find him nearly dead. Lying on the beach starving after a week. But after that Peter realizes that he actually wants to change. So the Circle Justice considers sending him back to the island. This is a very good book. It is a little disturbing at parts but it is really suspenseful."
1,"Touch Me, for I am Spirit Bear!!!","What...is this, people giving this book 4 and 5 stars...IT SUCKED, and I only read it because I had to!!*spirit bear and his college chum Ron the Tiger viciously maul Leanza Cornett to death*See, this book is violent, and is innapropreate for children...It should be burned, for the sake of the kids!! It teaches Peaganism,...and it also teaches children that it is ok to viciously maul people with their sharp claws and fangs, what upsets me more is that some schools require their students to read this book, why cant we read nice books like...Go Ask Alice.-Ron the Tiger Jr"
5,Thouching Spirit Bear,"I love the book Thouching Spirit Bear it is probablly one of my favorite book! I read every Brian Book by Gary Paulsen and I liked them, thouching spirit bear id almost like those books.I LIVE THOUCHING SPIRIT BEAR!!!!!!!"
5,WOW!!,"Me and my friends read this book in class for a reading group. We where surprised that it said a few cuss words, but it was great! when Cole smashes Peters head on the cement I was ""why would a fifteen year smash someones into cement?"". When he eats a live rat... I can't talk about it it was so disgusting! When Cole burns his supplies and shelter I said ""Cole is a crazy man!""."
5,Greatest Book Ever!,Touching Spirit Bear was a truly amazing book about Cole's endeavors to overcome his anger and change himself. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. You will never want to put this wonderful book down.
1,TOUCHING SPIRIT BEAR,"I read lot of book in the past, but the book that looks interested to me is the touching sprit bear, it a great book and it was written by Ben mikaelsen. This story takes place in Minneapolis. This book started with Cole and his friend peter, Cole is the main character in the story. Cole was 15 years old, and is very bad. One day, Cole went to school and fought Peter. After Cole fought peter they had to send him to juvenile, but Cole was doing the same bad stuff. After that they had to move Cole from juvenile to an island were he meat this big bear. He was trying to kill the bear but the bear almost kill him. I thing this book is a great book for everyone, because it teaches you a big lesson. For example one of the lessons I learn from this book is that you should control your self and always listen to people. It had another lesson that you can learn from the book too. But if you want to know more about the book"
1,WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,what is this. im reading this book in class and its nothing like this the kids name was peater not whatever the kids name is i love you ben michaelsen but if you want a better versoin of this book then get the one with a kid on the ground holding a knife rather than this one im not saying its not good i mean i think its a waist of money for this one and i dont mean to be affenive but read this one and the other one and i want you to write me back so i can see what other poeple think to make me a better reader!!!!!:D
4,Touching Spirit Bear,"Cole Mathews has a tough time in the beging of the novel. He just broke in to a hardware store and now hes hiting a kid name Peter driscole in the face and slaming him into the side walk. He now sits in the detetion center wait to find out what to do with him. He can choose bettween jail or circle justice. Cole chooses circle justice. He then he has to choose jail or going to a island for 1 year. He choses the islnd and when he gets there he burns the cabin he mentore built and then tried to swim to the next island. The current was too. As he was beached by the crushing waves a bear shows up. It dosent showay fear for cole and cole gets mad so he goes in for the kill with his knife; The book was a good book over all it was a book with many emotions, not much of a comedy.Dakota 9th Grade -"
3,Back in School,"This was a quick easy read,but engaging nonetheless. It has a similar feel as Red Badge of Courage which was the subject of much analysis in school. I found myself wondering if I was going to be asked to write a theme or essay using this book to support my premise."
5,book review by Michael oloya,I really liked the story touching spirit baer by Ben mikaelsen. In the story a kid named Cole matthews gets sent to court for smashing a kid named peters skull into the concreat because he was mad at him for talking smack. So while he's in court the judge gives him a life or death decision he gives him either to go to jail or circle justice. And he pickes to go to circle justice and with circle justice he gets sent to an island with a dangerous bear by himself . But you'll have to read more to find out if he survives or not.
5,touching spirit bear,This story is a very great one it tells of a boy named cole who ends up getting banished to an iland because he did not want to join the circle of justice.Since cole did not want to join the circle of justice they decided to send him to the iland to think about what he has done.So on the iland cole keeps seeing this bear but one day cole decides to kill the bear because the bear was not scared of him well cole ends up getting attacked by the bear and nearly killed.The circle of justice tyhinks he should go back to the iland even though he got attacked cause peter was in a bad state of depression and hd already tried to kill himself.Since cole was on the iland he thought peter should come to the iland.Peter comes to the iland and him andcole become friends!
3,Touching Spirit Bear by Jason Moore,The book Touching Spirit Bear is a good book that is about a boy named Cole who was beaten by his father and takes everything out on everyone.Now Cole is being sent to a deserted Alaskin island as punishment for beating up a boy named Peter for telling on him.At the island Cole burns down his cabin and tries to kill the spirit bear because it was not scared of him but that didnt go well considering he got mauled by the bear and had to go through months of physical therapy. As Cole is sent back to the island he had to build his own cabin now he sees things in a different way and wants to help peter get beter.
4,BREAK DOWN DA WALLLLLSSSSS,"YES, just get it already....everyone knows Ray Cappo is a huge hypocrit and sucks at life but this band is one this he happened to do really well"
1,Stupid sillyness,"Simple mind set lyrics. The vocal style rips off the band Antidote, the music is so basic and the jock image dress is akin to heavy metal kids dressing up glam: Style over substance.Youth of Today insult those who came before them with their holier than thou stance and history has proven me right: cheesy reunions that make Youth of Toady's Ray's lyrical declaration ""live fast, die young was just a trend"" seem positive. This band does not seem to want to go away. Stay away from this trite garbage"
1,ghastly,"BARRY MANILOW meets the BACKSTREET BOYS with a mediocre guitarist. Cheesy songs, even cheesier lyrics and not one redeeming feature. Sets the benchmark for dross in my 700+ collection. It could be used as a coaster, so it is not entirely useless."
2,Body and Soul,It was so boring. Maybe those who are into piano/classical music would appreciate it. The relationship between the young boy and the store owner was poignant.
3,Musically and Historically Rich,"If you have a musical background, this book is for you. The storyline sometimes got a bit bogged down in the musicality."
1,Melatonin,Assumed it was sublingual - my mistake. I have ordered 240 sublinguqal eslewhere as the price is considerably less expensive
5,nyc,We have bought several in all sizes. Very satisfied with good quality denim (very blue) and great price.
4,This Rocks,The Toshiba 50H82 is one of the best televisions I have owned. It has great picture quality and changes sources easily. You can have several sources going at one time and switch easily. With the PIP you can view each source(2 at a time). Overall this TV is worth the money. compared to others I checked out before buying.
5,Excellent set! Highly Recommended!,"I have owned my Toshiba 50H82 for approximately 6 months and have nothing but praise for the set. I have not had the luck of experiencing any HD pictures yet, but my progressive scan DVD (hooked up through component video) is remarkable! Digital cable looks great too (Analog is decent). I love the fact that this tv has wheels underneath as well as the fact that the top of the TV has about a 6-inch depth to act as a ""shelf"" so I can set my center-speaker for my surround on top.Very highly recommend this set!"
5,An Excellent Music CD,"Being 61 years old, I have listened to a lot of boleros, those by fairly recent artists such as Lucrecia, Martirio, Luis Miguel, and El Cigala with Bebo Valdes, to the ones by Roberto Faz, Orlando Vallejo, Lino Borges, Felipe Pirela, Daniel Santos, Julio Jaramillo, Bobby Capo, and so on. I can guarantee you, that if you like boleros, you'll love this CD by Isabel Pantoja. It is a great compilation of songs, performed beautifully by a great artist. This is my first review ever, but this CD deserves a lot higher rating than the current 3.5 stars that it now has. (08/26/2009)"
1,que lastima!,Isabel's voice is beautiful but her interpretation of boleros is plain awful! I'm sorry!!
1,Lemon,I bought the Sangean ATS 505 in Australia to use in Thailand. When I got here I opened it and found the SW did not work. The local repair shop said they could not fix it as it was poorly designed. Soon after that it did not work even for FM. It kept turning itself off. I emailed the company politely with every detail and got no reply. This company is clearly third rate.
3,Nice radio but some nitpicks,"- a nice radio and top rated by Radio Netherland- here are my nitpicks:1. LCD backlight only stays on for 7 seconds2. 1KHz tuning increment setting is inconvenient (you have to push in and turn the rotary knob first, and it only lasts for one tuning session)3. too few SW memory settings4. the back stand is useless unless you use the radio while sitting at a desk - a much better approach is to take an 8x10 sheet of plexiglass, heat and bend to make a stand so the radio sits more upright for use...5. the build feels 'flimsy' as the radio doesn't have a solid feel6. there is a discernable (1-second) delay when entering digits in the direct-access keypad - you'll need to get used to the delay, and the keys require more pressure than you'd expect for a keypad..7. battery life is not great"
1,SSB does not work,"This radio has fine reception on AM and FM; however, at this price the SSB should work too. It does not. Knowing that SSB reception can be enviroment dependent I tried several different times on several different days in city and country. I also used the attached antenna and a 23 foot external antenna. Trying to get help from Sangean is difficult and costly. They require money up front with no promise of a fix.If you want SSB reception forget this radio."
5,Incredible CD,I really dig good singer-songwriters and Jerling is near the top of my list. This CD is a great escape from the pop-music wasteland that has taken over the airwaves. I love this CD. I would really love to hear him live someday.
3,Not as good as the others,"I have to admit, I was looking forward to reading about how the wildcard virus affected the rest of the world, and I guess a fact finding tour is a decent way to work it into the universe, but the premise seemed forced. Maybe the authors intended it that way; or maybe I'm a bit to cynical, but it seems like there would be a more creative way to fit Hartman in with the rest of the wildcard supers.I liked the ideas that the book seemed to be reaching for...but in most cases the writing seemed flat and the tie-ins between the episodes felt awkward as well. I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the Diamond entries.What really interested me was the possibility of some of the storylines where they are not shoehorned into the world of Tachyon and company. The idea of a joker nation in central america and the Russian superagent seem like they could really take off if explored further. I'm hoping that they are in future books."
2,Not all that bad for a low budget film.,"I found this film to be more funny than anything, even though it was a drama. Anything glorifying the pimp game, especially when rappers try to do it can be hilarious. Katt Williams character as the MC in this movie was pretty funny. I guess you can say Mack 10 is running or done ran out of rhymes so now he's resulting to low budget films."
2,Remaster sounds worse than original CD,"I was excited to hear a remaster of this album. I've had the original Sire CD for years and listened to it relentlesly back in the 80s. The remasters I've purchased of other 80s rock such as Joe Jackson's Look Sharp and Echo and The Bunnymen's Crocodile sound way better than the originals. Clearly the technology is out there to make CDs sound full and multidimensional and musical. But the engineers failed on this one. My original sounds better. The remaster is scratchy and compressed. Did they even get the original master tapes, or is it a CD of an mp3? Keep your original or search for the 1988 Sire Records release!"
4,Good Product,Sharp EL-1192BL Desktop 2 Color Printing CalculatorWonderful calculator. It's everything the advertisement said and more. I love the large lighted numerals and it's ease of use.
2,I love Vornado Fans but . . .,"I am a big admirer of Vornado products. We have many of their fans and have gotten years of great service out of their products.I thought I would try their air purifier since I was so happy with their other products. I especially like the fact that their products are made in the USA and they offer great warranty service.After a long wait, the purifier arrived. It set up quickly but I was a little surprised at how flimsy the case was. It opened with the smallest touch. Rubberbands are used to keep the filter in place which didn't seem like a good idea since rubber ages so quickly.After one day of use, the purifier started giving off a horrible smell. The entire room began to smell of mildew. I am not sure if this was due to how the product was stored in the warehouse but the odor would not go away.Vornado tried to help but I ended up returning the product and buying a Hunter air cleaner."
5,Buy this machine!,"This is a great machine that does what its meant to do (cleans the air) and has not failed me in 10 years! We have a wood stove and and unvented kitchen stove and it takes all the smoke and cooking smells away, and quickly!"
1,Don't Bother,"Unfortunately, I purchased 2 of these machines for duplicating tapes. These are the worst machines I have ever owned. When I record on SLP, I can't view what I recorded. It just jumps all over. This happens on old tapes and brand new tapes. There have to be other machines available that are better. I've never owned anything but RCA machines, but this one is bad! Fast Forward & Rewind while viewing doesn't stop right away like my other machines. Not happy at all."
4,Great Extra Large Mailbox,"This is a great extra large mailbox. My mail is no longer folded in the box and most packages can be delivered, saving time going to the post office to pick up. The mailbox is all metal, with a metal flag and door handle, unlike other mailboxes I looked at. I chose to get the unpainted silver and paint myself and it looks great. I would give this mailbox a 5 if it was a little heavier gauge metal to make it really sturdy, and would have paid more for it then also. I highly recommend this box to anyone looking for an extra large mailbox."
5,Big Box!,"I just had to laugh when I saw the size of this mailbox. I had no idea it was so BIG! But it's exactly what you need if you if you do a lot of web ordering. Books, boxes, large envelopes, this mailbox can handle it all. I've fallen in love with it!"
5,Steel City Galvanized Rural Mailbox,"I was very pleased with this item. It came in just a few days, and in excellent shape."
4,Mail box,The box was of good quality (except for the plastic handles but....)and assembled easily. Installation was customized due to existing structure but instructions for a normal installation were clear and concise. Overall a very good value.
3,"OK book, lack of information","This book actually has a section for salt water fish and a section for freshwater plants. It is trying to cover everything with limited pages and left out some very important information.Such as in the plant section, it does not list the information for lighting or CO2 requirement, which I think it is critical for any plant care.If the book can add some information such as easy/hard to care indicator for all fish and plants, that will be a great help too.I also find that there are some very common fish missing, such as shovelnose cats, some rainbows, rams (it does not list the rams but has some information scattered all over the book).On the plus side, the pictures are all good and I really enjoy them. Overall, it is an OK book. I just wish it has more information. Consider what I paid for this book, I guess it is not bad at all."
5,A complete expert definitive advice directory guide,Every hobbiest has to agree and oppose that this practical useful expert information reference advice guide is both a confronting challange and a very costly endeavour for anybody going into or embarking in fish aquarium tanks.What this book lacks in having a firm price fish pet index resource reference it makes up for or replaces in having a unique beautiful respectful photography directory with side bar information on individual seperate species of fish.Also on the plus side of this hobby amazon readers is that you will get a greater deep understanding about the lifestyle of fish in giving you a assured confidence.
5,My Review for the book Aquarium & Pondfish,I found this book to be very imformative and full of wonderful pictures and information on almost any aquarium or pond fish you could imagine! A big thumbs up!!!!
5,"Great book, but be prepared for small type","While the songs won't ring as familiar as those in the Top 40 book, you'll undoubtedly find a song or two that you'd forgotten about or always wondered about. Unearthing these nuggets makes the purchase of a book like this easily worth the price, but in the case of this book, be prepared for the incredibly small type. Not a big deal if you're a young kid like I was when I bought it, but I notice myself having to squint a lot more when I read it these days. ;-)"
1,GLORIFIED VASELINE,"The company that makes this product is called Basic Organics.This leads me to believe that they make organic products.Always read your labels.E OINTMENT contains.16 gm wheat germ oil....very minimal100 iu vitamin E.........very minimal300 mg aloe..............very minimalIn an ""absorbable"" ointment base.........WHAT?Nice way to say ......we don't really want you to know what it is made of ,or we would put it on the label.So I call the company to confirm my suspicions ,it's VASELINE!!!!!!Don't waste your money just buy some Vaseline and ad a capsule of 400 iu Vitamin E and you'll have more potency than this product offers.The good ingredients are minimal but lead you to believe you're getting a high potency product with real organic ingredients. How did VASELINE get qualified as natural or organic?I also was going to gift this to a friend,good thing I called for ingredients,he is very allergic to petrochemicals of which vaseline is made."
2,Personal random thoughts...,"This book is really more of a personal reflection on today's society than a work of research. I found that it lacks foundation and is practicaly void of historical facts. Although broken down in five chapters, the book at times reads more like a collection of random thoughts without any real structure about the sujbect at hand - a defenitive lack of editorial skills in my opinion. That said, it does offer the reader something to think about, which does earn the book a couple stars!"
2,Post 1990s Blues,"Few write quite as well as Ms. Jacobs on social and urban issues. She takes a social subject, tosses it into a scientific vat and spurts out a work of art! However, in this work, Ms. Jacobs gets off track in some of the descriptions, taking the social context in the Toronto area and expecting it to function as a universal model."
2,Posible future trends,"Another case where a good publisher says, ""you have to have a more grabbing title."" Good thoughtful book with potential trends for the future, but weak forcasting of big future trends. More for Canada than the US."
1,The very worst of Jane Jacobs,"I finally picked up a copy of this book, assuming that Jacobs might have been picking up early signals of decline. Well, she did observe that a housing bubble was in the making and would eventually burst. But that's about it. I don't recall EVER reading a book that outlined its main thesis in the first chapter and then did so little in subsequent chapters to support it. In fact, the rest of the book is like a collection of justifiably-rejected magazine articles strung together. Having read her thought-provoking 'Systems of Survival', I found this a huge disappointment, one of the worst books I've read in many a year. How the book could have garnered any glowing reviews from any respectable journal is simply a measure of the lack of integrity of the press: she's an eminent author in her late 80s; let's be nice and give her a great review. This is a great thinker's last and least. Do yourself a favor and skip it."
2,Skip It,"In a nutshell, credentialing, atrophy of the scientific mind, and failures of professional ethics are leading to a new Dark Age where there is much information and little truth. And sooooo? Just tune into to your local news."
2,My review,"A basic book on Pagan holidays that can be used as a ""go"" to book for ideas. However, the information can also be found in other books on the market. I had higher expectations."
3,a lot of pleasure from this book,"I like it for learning the basics of the Sabbats/Esbats it is all around a very good book For a newcomer to the traditions and meanings within the pagan wheel of the year, this book was a good starter in experiencing those festivals and holidays. a lot of pleasure from this book"
3,"Laurie Cabot, hmmm...","This book is a good reference, but HIGHLY Celtic orientated. These rituals were obviously derived from the Cabot Tradition, (which, obviously, was founded by Laurie Cabot). The spells contain some highly unattainable ingredients and were rather unnecessarily complicated. And oddly enough, the back contained sources where you can buy those ingredients.Other than that, fairly well written. Except for the fact that I find it odd how she attributed the Element of Fire with the East Quarter. Hmm..."
3,Beautiful but sometimes obscure,"I thought the rituals in this book were quite beautiful; some of the best I have encountered for imagery and poetry. However, some of the ingredients for the spells would be extremely difficult to come by for the average practitioner (e.g. wolf's hair from a live, shedding wolf). It would be nice to have alternatives for some of these spells. The format is well done with the holidays organized symmetrically with one another. As a solitary, it would be difficult to incorporate the ritual elements into one's practice, but the beauty of it makes it well worth the time to study."
4,Great stories but this edition has numerous typos!,"I really enjoyed reading about Arsene Lupin (thanks Head Butler!) - a great character involved in some funny and/or exciting escapades. Despite my enjoyment, however, I contemplated giving this particular book three stars instead of four. My main reservation about this edition (ISBN 1-4065-0001-1) is the poor proof-reading job done by the Dodo Press - often there are words with letters omitted and, in more than one instance, whole paragraphs are repeated before the story continues. Other than the disappointing editing job, however, I highly recommend getting acquainted with Arsene Lupin and this is why I ultimately decided on a four star rating."
1,"Great Story, terrible publishing.","I really enjoyed the Book itself, but as for the multiple spelling errors, typos and repeating paragraphs, the book was terrible! Also,top line of each page was trimmed off, leaving me to guess half the time what the words said. So overall, my experience with this version of the book from ""bibliobizarre"" was very poor. I recommend looking for the same book from a different publishing co. Maurice LeBlanc would be ashamed of this sorry excuse for a book!!"
2,steal this book--please,"Reminded me of an episodic TV detective show--interesting premise (gentleman burglar) executed poorly, without much verve. Leblanc is more interested in going on and on about how great his hero is--a matter of reputation--than in showing us how he works in any sort of interesting way--a matter of dramatic tension. Most of these tales have the transparent dramatic devices (how many ""It's Lupin in disguise!"" tricks can you pull in one book?) and anti-climactic conclusions of Grimms' fairy tales. Usually it's more important to Leblanc that Lupin did a crime than it is HOW he did it, which isn't nearly as interesting. There are a few exceptions, but basically this is thin melodrama, striking concept though it may be.--J.Ruch"
4,Kinda New-Old School...,"I guess that depends on how old you are.. I remember when this was the *new* style, so there ya go. That said, I grew up on this stuff, so how could I not recommend it? But given the recording quality (did they record this thing underwater or what?!?), unless you are really into '86 - '90 NYC hardcore (and if you are, why dont you have this already?), you may want to look elsewhere..."
5,OLDSCHOOL NEWYORK HARDCORE,One of the best oldschool bands ever. Every song is an anthem and if youre straight edge nailed to the X is the song for you. a classic and a must have if youre into hardcore.
3,SxE for Rinseys,"Bold... If you were 15 at the time (and in the crowd at the Anthrax), they redefined your world...Now, well...it's fun for nostalgia's sake, but that's about all. Rinsey still loves this stuff...even the crappy ""Today we live"" 7"", but I think Rinsey still has a crush on Matt. Rinsey is a crazy old pooch like that though. Rinsey sang on the XStampedeX album. Get that.NHXCH"
3,No more unexpected disconnect's,"I love this new US Robotics 56K internet call modem. When I purchased my HP computer 6475Z it came with a HFC Rockwell riptide modem that could only connect at 24000-33666 at it's best. With no help from the HP company, I decided to get a modem on my own. This new modem from US Robotics has not lost it's connection with my ISP which is the same as used before. It connects at 42666 or higher every time (great improvement). The other features included with this modem are really nice and should save me enough money on long distance calls for the modem to pay for it's self ( free phone calls in the US ). Also with the speakerphone feature I can talk on instant message service's also. I feel it's a hidden treasure waiting to be found by all. Priced right too, great value."
1,Nightmare installation,"Don't buy this modem if you have Windows 2000. Even though the box claims that the modem can be installed on Windows 2000, the drivers CD accompanying the modem has no drivers for Windows 2000! AFter discovering that, I went to their website and downloaded the driver for 2000. But 2000 would not install the driver because it kept complaining about missing INF files. I find it hard to believe that this product was released without testing drivers for Windows 2000."
1,STAY AWAY FROM U.S. ROBOTICS,"U.S. Robotics will take your money and give you garbage in return. I have their external USB faxmodem and it was one of the worst supported products I have ever purchased. Their web site is a confusing mess and their driver development always lags, if they even have a driver for the product at all. Their support numbers and email are useless.This company is irresponsible and looking to take your money without properly supporting the product."
2,Not Compatible with Windows 2000,"This modem was a great disappointment. After following the directions included... it was determined that this modem sometimes works with 2000, but in most cases such as mine, it does not. I then tried to install the modem on my windows 95 system to avoid sending it back. The software included by 3COM, did not install the modem as promised.... I doubt if I will even buy another USRobotics product again."
5,Coty Musk is the best,"I have used Coty Musk cologne for a long time and recommend it to anyone who wants a ""fresh"" clean scent on their body. This particular fragrance is awesome. Women are always coming up to me and telling me I smell great. It's kind of embarrassing since my wife wants to know why all these women are talking with me when we're out in public. Anyway guys, you would be fore warned if you use this product since it seems to drive women wild. I'm NOT kidding."
5,"Sturdy ladder, not the best packaging job","This is definitely a hefty, sturdy ladder. It weighs noticeably more than a 4' Werner, single step sided ladder, but I like the convenience of having steps on both sides, and the extra foot. Two people can use the ladder at the same time, and you can simply switch to the other side if you need to move a little while working. It's also more sturdy to use as a scaffolding plank support.As for the packaging, I received it packaged within a bare standard cardboard box with no reinforcement or packing material whatsoever. Some doubled up cardboard around the feet and top would have been nice. There were some small bends in the bottom steps and the box had obviously been abused a bit by UPS."
4,Elvis fans should have it,"This is a pretty darn good recording. I always wondered why it didn't make a bigger splash. I guess when the single is about an older lady experiencing Alzheimer's disease, that is to be expected. I'd would encourage an Elvis fan to get it. It's a pretty ambitious album and it's wonderfully varied in style. One thing that I really like about Spike is that for an 80's recording, it doesn't sound dated at all. It's stood up to time very well.""God's Comic"" is a classic as far as I'm concerned and I don't think any of the other reviewers even mentioned it. My other faves are ""Stalin Malone"" and ""Chewing Gum"", but the album is strong overall."
4,Getting better with age,"I enjoyed Spike when it first came out in the late eighties, but then lost interest in it. It shuffled to the backwaters of my collection and was on deck a couple of times for re-sale. I'm glad it never made it to the used CD shop. I've recently given this a couple spins and have rediscovered a fine album. Spike features some of Elvis' best arrangements and most pungent lyrics (no small feat). Stylistically all over the map, this is not an easy disk to digest, but several tracks such as Let Him Dangle, Tramp Down the Earth and God's Comic are true classics of Costellian proportions. The Dirty Dozen Brass Band adds spice to the affair, while Marc Ribot(guitar) and Micheal Blair(percussion) add a Tom Waits-like flavor. While I do not have the version with the bonus disk, I'm sure that it contains some items of mild interest. Get it."
2,Don't like Spike,"Some fans like 'Spike'. I'm not one of them. 'Veronica' is a classic and 'Deep Dark Truthful Mirror' is solid, but the rest of the songs here are hit and miss...mostly miss."
3,essential Elvis? Really!,"I cannot believe, with all the brilliant albums in Costello's catalog, that Amazon.com would have this as an essential release. I tried so hard to like this album when it came out, but it was always a struggle to get through it. I haven't listened to it for years, and have absolutley no desire to revisit it. Though I like Veronica, I still don't consider it one of his really great songs. And that is by far the best song on the album."
4,One of his most interesting albums...,"Like many others, I was utterly confused the first time I heard this album. It covers so many different styles and it is nowhere near as focused as Elvis' earlier work. At it's worst, it has some interesting, yet rather aimless, musical experiments. This is the case with Stalin Malone and a few other tracks. But when it's good, it's really good. God's Comic, Let Him Dangle, This Town, Tramp The Dirt Down, Veronica, and Mirror are all among the best songs he's ever recorded. It's certainly enough to forgive some of the album's weaker points. If you're into Elvis, this is must buy. If you are new to his music, you would definitely be better off with earlier recordings like Get Happy and Armed Forces. This is a very experimental album, but it has some of the best songs you'll ever hear. Give it a listen and approach it with an open mind."
1,does not appear to be new,"Spike (With Bonus Disc)I ordered a new CD and it arrived without wrapper and unsealed. The CD case was scratched up. The CD appeared new and unused. I contacted the company and they agreed to replace it after a slow response, if I sent it back. Although they are located within the city I live, I could not do it in person they said. I had to attend a birthday party and did not have time to do the mail thing. I had purchased it for the birthday present but I gave it anyway, explaining the circumstances. I paid for a new CD and in my opinion that should have been sealed with a wrapper. I would not purchase from them again."
1,Horrible!,Now despite what anyone says this is unlistenable. I loved Costello but here really...avoid at all costs.
2,It could have been better -- much better....,"""Grave Passions"" could have been better -- much better.Though the collected short stories of horror and suspense all do have a decidedly LBG cast to them, they all seem to have been wearily written by the contributing authors, some of whom are personal favorites of mine. Writers who can captivate with the imagery of their description, like porn star/writer/publisher Scott O'Hara and author Felice Picano, are really only just going through the motions of trying to scare the reader.For those looking for something scary to read in bed, you'd do better to cross over to the ""straight"" side and read all of the ""Hot Blood"" erotic horror anthologies that continue to be published -- and continue to be successful. ""Grave Passions"" is lacking that spark of magic that ""Hot Blood"" appears to have -- so much so, it can't even claw its way out of a dull and dreary grave if its (un)life depended on it"
4,Well-photographed guide to North American Fly Fishing,I had the opportunity to look over this book for the first time several months ago as a gift from my wife. The places that the authors visited and photographed look phenomenal and the book has an honored place on my den coffee table.A great buy for the fly fisherman (or woman) in your life.
2,dissapointed,"Feel very dissapointed since order this item from venezuela and after a month of waiting due to customs, etc. were brown color and not the color i order as the picture and title offers gun metal and grey lenses, so if they run out of the model they shoul tall me and not sent me something I didnt want it."
2,"Cheaply made, small pieces","Flimsy board. Very small pieces. Not like the one I grew up with, but I guess about what should have expected for the price."
3,checkers/chess game,The game was for my grandchildren. But I thought the game board was to thin not made like it use to be and the cardboard that it came it was soflimsy that it just fell apart and ripped so easly.
1,"Machine Embroidery, Stitch Techniques","Had I the opportunity to ""thumb through"" the book before I bought it - I would not have made this purchase. Virtually all the pictures are in black and white, which make it extremely hard to discern what was done (i.e., layering, decroative stitch, fabric, etc). Yes, the technique is written for you, but a ""color"" visual along with the written word would have made for a far more superior book. I venture to say, this book will be donated to my public library."
1,out of date,"If I had a chance to see this book before buying I would not have paid a dime for it.It's almost totally in black and white,and the chapter on ""Exploring Colour"" has no photos at all. The copyright is l989 with no revisions only reprints. A total waste of money."
2,very average,like alot of his 80's material this one is very average.the material has a few catchy Phrases and what have you but not a must have.I respect Marcus Miller but unlike then his music hasn't dated that well on Miles.he did better Production on David Sanbourn.
2,Mild Miles,"2 1/2Entrenched Eighties production would be forgivable if there was more substance to the songwriting but this sadly remains a mainly tired affair, offering acceptable trumpet lines over casio-toned production, though not without a share of noteworthy moments amidst the onslaught of fusion caricature."
2,hard to get into this one...,"I have several dozen Miles recordings, and I listen to each regularly. Except this one.I've played this 10-20 times, and I just can't get into it. Had I known how little I would enjoy it, I would have pocketed the money I spent instead.You can't go wrong with virtually any other Miles album, so try something else first, say, ""Nefertiti"" or ""Milestones."" At the very least, sample ""Amandla"" before buying."
3,Fantastic Television,I bought this television a little over a year ago when my regular 27 inch tube TV went out. SO far I have been 95% satisfied with this TV. The picture is incredible expecially when watching DVD's hooked up with Monster cables. The Cable (digital) picture quality is very good as well.. not perfect but about 4.3. The sound is my only minor issue as I need to turn it up quite far sometimes to hear it over household noises (I'm 25 and my ears are fine). I would give the sound on this TV as well as my other Toshiba TV a 4.0 so I'm thinking its a brand specific thing. I love Toshiba quality and price. Sony for the virtually the same product is usually $50 to $100 more and not worth the extra money. Overall I am enjoying this TV and wouldn't trade it for another one in its class.
2,Very dissapointed,"Based on the reviews and the average 5 star rating I thought I would upgrade from my 15 year old 25 inch Zenith, hoping to get significant improvement in resolution quality. However, the resolution was not much better than my old TV, ..."
4,A cute a funny books that kids will adore.,"This is a story about a young girl, Dolores, that gets a kitty, Duncan. Dolores is so excited about her kitty that she smoothers it with attention, along with dresses. The cat is annoyed with all of her attention and favors Dolores' sister instead. Dolores is jealous and decides to ignore Duncan and play by herself instead. While Dolores focuses her attention elsewhere Duncan realizes that Dolores can really be a fun and loveable girl. Plus, Dolores finds out what it takes to win Duncan's love and attention!"
3,not a good album,"about this mimi lp. not as good as people said. 4 songs i liked out of this. the rest was junk. the remaster was to harsh. not smoothed out. i can have the police at my door. thats how bad it was. my floor vibrated cause of the bass. but the remaster was fine, not perfect. i got all 3 of joe walsh mini lp and they have the same problem as this one did."
5,Rain Guage,I bought this rain gauge for my father and he loves it. He says it really is the world's coolest rain gauge.
5,Terrific Product!,"This rain gauge is a wonderful addition to any garden. It gets more attractive over time because of the natural patina it takes on. What's more, it's accurate. If you're looking for an unusual, yet practical rain gauge, you'll probably like this one."
4,Nice addition to your garden,"This attractive rain gauge both beautifies an area and gives you a reading on the rain. My only complaint is the floating polycarbonate insert deteriorates in a year or two and the inserts are very hard to procure. As a matter of fact, I am searching for some now."
1,Major Problems,"The Toshiba worked well for a couple of weeks. At first, I was unable to program some of the channel names in. The unit turned off once or twice by itself. Then, one night, the picture became all distorted, with white squiggly lines going everywhere. The sound became filled with static and horrible loud snapping sounds.I called one of the key service centers listed on the Toshiba web sight. They took a week to come out to repair it. When the got here they said it had to go to the shop. They told me they would pick it up in a week. I have no idea how long it will take to repair it."
1,lousy services,"~We bought total six Sets and sold five of them. The last one was an reward to employee. It was DOA. Called Toshiba on Feb.13. They redirected the service to local third party service company. Technican came and looked at it. It was defective and needed repaired. Parts was not available and would order through Toshiba. One month later, nobody came back. Called again, the service center said that you needed to bring that TV in for service. Called Toshiba and was told that there is on site warranty~~ for thismodel. The service center was supposed to pick up the defective TV. The service center told Toshiba that we refused to have them picked it up (which was a lie that they later admitted). Then Toshiba referred another TV repair shop to handle the situation. They were supposed to pick up the TV yesterday. NO ONE SHOWED UP. CALLED TODAY, NO BODY SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG. WE FILED COMPLAIN THROUGH BBB. AND thinking possibly filing small claim court against Toshiba.~"
4,happy with my purchase,"Thank God for the internet. I bought this unit a couple of months ago and have had the same subtitling problem that other owners have had. Will now go and try their solutions.This is a nice little unit for the money that loads quickly, delivers a good picture, is pretty easy to set up, and is great-looking. The remote could definitely have been better. (Why is it that the main interface area of most consumer electronics seems to get so little design attention?)"
1,Returned it and bought an Apex.,"Very slow DVD Movie load times, Clunky Remote, and can only get the subtitles to shut off if I go to the DVD Player, the remote is hit and miss with shutting them off."
1,Piece of Junk,Subtitles dont go away. In the middle of the movie the screen shoots to video 1. Slow loading ...........overall this is a piece of [bull]!! Buy a Sony you get what you pay for.
3,Where's the sound???,"While the picture looks great, it would be nice if the product advertised advised people that they would also need to purchase an audio cable separately in order for the player to operate completely. It was very frustrating. I also felt that the connection directions could have been better written, especially for those of us not familiar with hooking up electronic devices."
2,Screen brightness comes and goes - HELP,The brightness on the screen comes and goes. I have been told this is a safety feature to stop my copying DVDs? I am using the composite video out into my TV which has a built in video. Any suggestions?
2,Brightness seems fade in and out,"I just bought this DVD and have set it up fine, however the brightness of the screen seems to fade in and out ever 90 seconds or so. I can't see anything in the manual about this. I am using the single composite video out into my TV which has a built in video.Any thoughts would be welcome! Thanks."
2,...pile of junk,"You play the movie and the subtitle kicks on, you turn off the subtitle and it turns back on again, this goes on over and over. The zoom button zooms to big and has that small box in the left top corner that blocks the picture out. You can't get that small box removed. The player is so junky, they don't even put their name on the remote, guess they don't want people to know how ... this player really is. ...buy the Apex for ..., great zoom and the subtitle works only when you want to use it."
4,Good for the money,"I received this item last week and so far it plays very good. My only complaint is the subtitles go on automaticly when the movie starts so I have to go back and turn them off. This has to be done through the movie's menu not the player's, otherwise they keep going on. MP3s play flawlessly. I played about 10 movies so far and all played well."
2,Not very good quality,The spinner hardly works and the cards are flimsy. I would have liked stronger cardboard and a better board to keep track of the numbers.
2,Disappointed,"The box looks wonderful but the pieces inside are so sadly cheap I'm just glad this wasn't purchased for children.The spinner is just cardboard and after our 1st four games the color is already wearing off the wheel. In addition, the wheel and bingo cards are just thin card stock. I could have drawn this on my own card stock.And with the spinner, you often repeat the same bingo call outs - pieces to pull out and set aside would be nicer.Overall I was disppointed as Pressman, I thought, was always a good company. Definitely would not advise this for children as the small pieces for the cards are very small and could easily choke a youngster."
5,Great Substitute for a Medicine Chest,"How to Live 365 Days a Yearis a book that can work wonders for you if you suffer from the 76 percent of the physical problems that typically send people to doctors' offices. These are real problems, but they are more often than not caused by one's state of mind.Dr. Schindler has clearly explained the link between mental attitude and the physical manifestations of involuntary secretion into the system. And it makes perfect sense.I would recommend this book to all; not just to hypocondriacs. This is a preventative dose of what most of us need most of the time."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book was terribly pointless and focused on sex and emotions. There was absolutely nothing helpful, nothing pertaining to actually living a good or fulfilling life. I had hoped it would be like The Magic of Thinking Big, since that was what caused Amazon to recommend it to me. I actually threw it away; I never throw books away. But this ""book"" taught me nothing of value. I don't recommend it to anyone, except maybe as kindling for a fire."
3,Diverse Body Art,"This book shows examples of diverse range of body art which is available. It is divided into a number of distinct areas which include tattoos, henna, nail art, bindi, body jewels, body paint, hair design and piercing. The body art on display covers small areas of the body, such as, the face, eyes, belly button, shoulder, wrist, etc."
4,Body Art Chic,This book was pretty cool it showed me how to do all these things with my hair you know new and modern kinda stuff I liked that part. It also gave me some tips on piercing stuff on my own some sterilization tecniques and stuff that was a life saver cause I didn't get an infection. it also tells you how to draw those awsome designs on your hands and draw little forehead orniments. I gave this book only 4 stars cause some of the intstructions are confusing.
1,What a waste of a good title,Why did the author even bother making this a Holmes story? If he wanted to write a Victorian Sci Fi/Fantasy story did he have to use Holmes and Watson as his protagonists? Fails to capture either the flavour of the original stories or the period. In addition the plot is convoluted and required an effort to stay interested. I did in the hope that it would get better towards the end but I felt cheated by the time I finished.
3,Super Reader,"This Holmes pastiche starts reasonably well as a barely met acquaintance of Watson's dead wife comes to them for help from Singapore.Where the book loses its way is in the middle, with extended periods of Watson and Holmes separated, and taking Holmes off-page more is perhaps not the best idea, in general, if you are going to do this sort of thing.Muslim captains, giant ratmen, dodgy lords, mysterious women, all the elements for a decent adventure are there."
1,Frankly I wonder why I even bother reading Sherlock Holmes p,"Frankly I wonder why I even bother reading Sherlock Holmes pastiche's anymore. They are usually so dreadful.Well, this attempt is pretty dreadful too. And dull. Very dull. And the plot is somewhat unbelievable. Did I mention tedious and dull?"
4,Holmes the adventurer,"Although others did not enjoy Vanneman's work, I am not among them. Its true this story strays from the classic Holmes style, but I was intrigued by this fact and could not put the book down until I finished. There were some issues which I could have done without (how many times will Watson get drunk and wake up in danger), but the adventurous tone was refreshing. I enjoyed the captain and the Widow's characters as well as the terror of Holmes' and Watson's journey to the Far East. I'll admit the ending was a bit too sci-fi and it seemed rushed, but I will be awaiting Vanneman's next interpretation of the great detective."
1,"Starts Well, Quickly Disappoints","The PW review above is dead on. With its action-and-travel oriented plotting, lack of character depth, and sensational-but-stupid visual events, this reminds me of a treatment for a bad action film with an [stupid] plot - i.e., a plot that only makes sense if you accept that all the characters are [stupid]. Author couldn't decide whether to draw the pseudoscience McGuffin from genetics, physics, or history, so he used them all, plus more, in a ghastly muddle of distraction.The sexual encounters by Watson were sheer vaudeville... The occasional patches of good writing and sensitivity shine like diamonds in a big nasty cesspool of, well, bad writing and insensitivity."
1,"Sherlock Holmes fans, beware","As others have noted, this book starts very well, with Vanneman offering a reasonable imitation of Doyle. But once Holmes and Watson leave England, the book takes a sharp turn for the worse. Watson goes on a long sea voyage, with Vanneman seemingly describing each league along the way. He has sex with four different women, a most un-Doyle idea. Holmes is off stage far too long, thinly-written other characters intrude, and finally the reader's patience wears out altogether. There have been several pastiches based on Doyle's mention of Holmes involvement in a case centering on a giant rat of Sumatra, and few have been good. This is the worst yet."
2,"A Weak Effort for ""Modern"" Readers","This book probably had potential, but the author failed to put it all together. Worst of all, he tried to make it attractive to modern readers by having Watson engaged in several sexual encounters and hinting that Holmes was involved romantically with one of the female characters. Authors of Holmes pastiches need to stay away from this."
5,A great collection of true Celtic Harp music,I saw Therese Honey playing with The Chieftains in Texas not that long ago and I was just amazed by the skill and beauty with which she play the harp. It's amazing to hear Celtic harp music played on historically accurate instruments. Honey clearly spends a lot of time working to reproduce the true music of that lost age. I don't know if you can hear anything that sounds so close the real thing without going back in time. This CD is a treasure.
4,positive anthemic European punk.,"Well, I'm pleased with this disc. Top to bottom, it's not what I would call awesome, as I can take or leave about half of these songs, so I was tempted to rate it at 3 stars, but the inspiring and uplifting anthemic strength of some of these songs forces me to give it a solid 4. ""We are the Kids"" and ""I Crisis"" are standouts. Hell, there's a lot of catchy songs on this album, it's just that a few are a bit too poppy for my taste. I think the singer is actually from the UK, which would explain why they made the ""transition"" to English so well :p. Soundwise, I would compare them to a less silly version of the Toy Dolls. I think they also compare favorably to Menace and The Partisans, though they're a bit more optomistic and upbeat than these bands. I really like their sound. Their positive attitude makes them great for summer day listening, like 7 Seconds. At any rate, I hope this helps you :)."
1,Rip off,"Don't buy this album. This band is really terrible and has ripped off the original band ""District"" of their name. DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM."
2,DVD,This DVD has a faulty area that skips and I was unable to find a way to return it. Not very happy.
5,Nice!,"This filter truly scrubs the room well... After about 2 hours at full speed, I walked into the room, took a deep breath, and it felt like a real relief."
2,Humminbird 7400771 MS M Mount System,"The mount is a very poorly designed piece of plastic. It will not rotate at all, it has VERY limited forward tilt capability, it has VERY limited backward tilt capability,it is difficult to release the unit to remove it, the depth finder goes off from loss of contact when you hit waves and when the unit is not on it the contacts are sitting in a completely exposed position(unless you buy the OPTIONAL cover.) It is simply a terrible design overall and I'm surprised that it is still around. I'm even more surprised that anyone could give it a 5 star rating.John Mills"
4,Replaced the old broken one perfectly.,Replaced the old broken one perfectly. It took less than fifteen minutes to replace the broken one on the boat.
2,Humminbird Mount System,This is the third Humminbird mount system I have had to buy. They are made out of cheap plastic and break easily when trying to detatch the head from the mount. I am dissappointed by this product but do not have a more favorable solution to mounting my Humminbird to my boat. I have a 700 series unit.
5,must have for every train lover,"Our 3 year old is obsessed with trains and finds this book everywhere. I finally bought it for him and he reads it every day. Yes, he reads it himself because he knows the book by heart. He points to the words on every page and knows what they say. If you know any child that likes trains, they will love this book."
5,Great for toddlers,"He loves it.. When he reads to me..he say freight train......gone! Sturdy and small enough to carry. Has tne campanion book from same author, but destroyed that within 2mins"
3,"Great classic book, not the greatest quality","The quality of the board book was not the greatest. It was somewhat bent but not damaged, I got it for a gift so I didn't have time to get a replacement before I had to give it as a gift. More or a flimsy board book than a sturdy one. Was not super happy with the quality even though it is a great book."
5,Book loved by toddlers,This book has wonderful illustartions. It is written so that young children can grasp the concepts in this book
5,Going....going......and going!!!!!!!!,"I loved the book the first time i saw it in the bookstore! Pictures are big, colors are bright...what's more amazing is how it helped my daughter know about her colors PERFECTLY at an early age. I owe the author a big one! Thanks! Well, i've given out your book twice as birthday present since i bought it last January and i'm stil going..going...to! :)"
3,Tepid Reception By My Train Lover,"My son (3) loves trains. I cannot tell you how many Thomas & Friends trains we have, in a variety of materials and sizes... and he loves train books, again in numerous supply... BUT he was very tepid about this book.First, by three-ish who doesn't know what a tender and box car are? And then, what 3 year old doesn't know his colors?So... 2 Stars for the 3 and older group..Still, having said that, I think this might make an excellent book for train-crazy toddlers as there are a number of things that this book can teach them. Colors, names of train cars, and counting come to mind.Three Stars then for any toddler *crazy* about trains. [Don't expect long term interest and don't expect all toddlers to understand that `blurred' pictures equate to going fast.]Two Stars for anyone else."
5,Simple yet classic,Such a great book! I bumped into this one at the bookstore as I was making my weekly run to grab some new books for my little one. This book has been one of his favorites. He devours books and this one has been one that has captured his attention longterm.The colors are bright and bold and it has been engaging.He loves to call out the different train compartments and colors and loves the ending the best when the train is going going gone! I have also given this one as a birthday gift!
5,an absolute favorite,"of both my little boys. it helped my oldest with his colors and it became a soothing story to read at bedtime. my youngest has since claimed it as his own and goes through the motions with me as i read to him....going, going......gone!love it!"
5,Great classroom book,My preschool students LOVE this book. Be prepared to read it over and over and over again! Great for teaching colors.
5,A favorite of my kids and now grandkids,"I originally bought this book in the 1980's for my son. I found that we were borrowing it from the library EVERY week! So - I ordered it, and this was back in the days before we had amazon.com to make buying books easy. My granddaughter now loves this book as much as her Uncle did as a child. It was the very first book I started to read to her as an infant, and I would bounce her around as the train moved faster and faster... and then STOP at the end. Now that she is almost 3, she is still enjoying it, and I think she could repeat every word herself. The one I have is not a board book so it was the first book that she got to play with that had real turning pages too. It actually has held up quite well through both of my children and now my granddaughter. If something were to happen to this book, I would buy another one. That is how much I love it. The illustrations are bright and bold, the story is simple, and the train is a rainbow of colors."
4,Freight Train,Great for boys and to learn colors. Could have more words to learn. Quality of book is superior. How about mention of the types of cars besides freight cars?
4,Get on board...,My Daughter loves this book. Its short and sweet yours will love it too! The pictures come to life and help your little one understand the world of trains and why they are interesting.
5,Great Children's Book,"My son got this book for Christmas, because I was so tired of hauling it back and forth to and from the library. There's something about the structure of the book that just mesmerizes him--I think it might be the transition from knowledge and understanding of colors and the names of the cars, to movement of the train through the countryside. It may be a boy thing--he's never cared for the highly verbal books his sister enjoyed so much, but wants this book over and over and over and over. One bonus is that it's relatively short, and appealing enough that I don't mind how often I've had to read it. I highly recommend this book, particularly for parents of preschool boys."
2,OK,Pretty pictures but not much else. My 2YO loves trains so I bought this. There's not much substance or variation in this book. I felt like it might make a better poster than a book.
3,book review,"there is one tear in the book, a page thats almost 3/4 the way tore, which i dont recall being described in description, other than that product as expected"
3,Very small book,"Cute little book, just be aware that it is a small book, not a lap book. It came very quickly. My 2 yr old is going to love it."
5,PERFECT,This book is the greatest children's book ever created - it was always my favourite. Simple and elegant images tell the story of the freight train. Highly recommended!
1,Great Visuals - Terrible Written Word,"I love the visuals of this book, which is why it is so frustrating that there is no narrative frame, the words don't flow off the tongue (e.g., ""Red caboose at the back Orange tank car next Yellow hopper car""). Grammatically a train wreck, heh heh: periods are inconsistently used, capitalization is all over the map too. Not a good example for baby, in my view. Does HaarperCollins have any copy editors?"
4,Must have for the snow and mud,Purchased this product to get my neighbors unstuck during those winter months and when my friend can't stay on the roads.
3,my first birkenstocks,"They took a little bit of getting used to as they have a ""lip"" on the front edge....quite comfortable but I should have gotten a narrow width instead of a regular width"
3,Wrong Size Conversion!,I ordered a pair of these sandals for my husband who wears a 14 in US mens. On the size selector it indicates that a 48 Regular EU is equal to a US size 14. When i received the sandals there was a 15 US/48 EU marked on the sole and it they were too large. So I'm going to order the next size down and hope that they will be a 14 US. Other than that the sandals themselves are great.
4,Great Shoes,"My son wanted these for Christmas, and I couldn't believe my luck when I found them for almost half their normal price! Shipping was free and fast. My only issue was that the shoes ran so big that I had to return two pair before we found the right size. No problem though, because Amazon was awesome about sending replacements quickly. Thanks so much!"
1,Junk,"The connectors will work with the included quick-connect air coupler but not with any other.They slide right out of the one on my compressor.The product is listed with ""Finely-machined"" in the description. Not even close.Seems like the products from this outfit are inexpensive and of poor quality.I thought I'd give it a shot but wouldn't recommend any purchases here if you're looking for quality merchandise.."
5,Lesser known Basie title swings like crazy.,"The late 50's saw the return of the Basie band to it's former glory. Joe Williams is in rare form on this record as is the rest of the band. His duet with Sammy Davis Jr. on ""Hallelujah"" will make you jump out of your seat and boogie right there on the spot. Recording quality is excellent. Highly recommended for Basie beginners and Basiephiles alike."
1,This is so bad its up there with William Hung's CDS!!,"My God this sucks, what the Hell was Blue Note thinking when this garbage was prepared for the RVG treatment? The music is like a bad Shaft sex scene, or some background filler for 70's pimps to put on; no, wait even pimps knew their music better than this dribble. I'd pay 2 cents for this if it were in that price range, but apparently some suckers have spent almost $20 on this nightmare; remember this is when Blue Note was sold and went completly down hill- (history) O, well. jb"
4,Bluenote Rules!!!,I'm glad to see this stuff is finally available. I love Andy Beys work I heard Happy Medium on Public Radio and really liked it. Thanks Bluenote!!!
1,Bootlegged and Bad Sound,"This CD is the same CD that keeps appearing, same songs. Some bootlegger keeps making new artwork and new album title-don't be fooled there is nothing new about this!I WOULD RECOMMEND BUYING AL JARREAU'S NEW ALBUM ""ALL I GOT"" - it is released on September 17, 2002 and I just can't wait! More jewels of jarreau."
3,Awesome piece of NYHC!,"I lived for GB in the late-80s, and had the good fortune to see them open for Bold in '90. This cassette practically lived in my car those days. Many good times for me are associated with this disc, but that aside it's chock full of catchy tunes and inspiring lyrics. The production by Don Fury is, of course, excellent. Stand out cuts are New Direction, Forgotten, and, of course, Start Today. Singer Civ went on to great things with, well, CIV ... Other great Revelation Records releases to check out are the Orange 9MM, Burn, and Quicksand EPs. As well as the Judge full-length, Bringin' it Down."
3,"simple plot, interesting take from a new author","I have never reviewed a novel in Amazon, but since I was already shopping, I figured I'd give my take on Desert Places. Desert Places is not the type of novel I would read, normally, but for anyone into thrillers I would suggest giving this book a try. Mr. Blake has a fertile imagination and it will be nice to see how he develops in future writings. I read through the other reviews and I have to agree that the middle drags a little, and the ending wasn't the best, but I also thought his friend died rather conveniently-but hey life has its conveniences, so why not? Overall, Desert Places is a quick and easy read, and good for a change of pace."
5,Makes you drop the blinds at night!,"This book is scary as H*^LL!! It will have you dropping the blinds and double checking the doors before bed! The worse part is there are probably people out there in this world that are this wicked! I loved this book so much,now reading the prequel and it is just as scary,,KEEP THEM COMING!!!!"
4,Absolutely Terrifying,"This is, without a doubt, one of THE scariest thrillers that I've read. There were multiple times when I'd read something, drop my jaw, and then have to re-read the passage (because it was such a terrific twist, etc). More than once I said to myself, ""you did NOT just do that..."" Seriously terrifying stuff. Don't read this before bed if you want to be able to drift off peacefully.That said, I was disappointed in the ending. I don't want to give too much away, but I felt somewhat short-changed by the last portion, but after thinking about it for a while, I think understand why Crouch ended it the way he did. The ending isn't ""bad,"" per-se, but it's somewhat ""abrupt"" compared to the rest of the story (and its flow).I've already downloaded the sequel..."
4,People may misunderstand the contents,"Desert places is a very good novel. Loved the point of view, the way you see things by the perspective of the writers mind makes it very interesting. Though people may misunderstand the contents in the novel, this is a story for only some audiences. This novel shows the true and ugly mind of a serial killer and the plot couldnt make it better. A writer with a twin brother who is a serial killer makes it a real amazing ride. Its family vs.moral. I strongly recommend this novel. Blake Crouch is the writer of our time."
3,Too scary for me,"I reached a point in this book where I decided I'd had enough scary for one book, then I looked down and saw I was only 50% of the way through it. For adrenaline junkies, it will be perfect, but for me, I had to read the rest of it in half chapter doses. That took awhile. I'm glad I finished it, but it makes me rethink whether I want to read any more by this author."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","The basic premise of the story was intriguing, but far too often the plot moves forward simply because the ""hero"" fell asleep or downed a few gulps of booze at the most inopportune moment - as though Crouch wrote himself into a corner from which he could not otherwise escape. This resulted in ""oh c'mon"" moments that put the brakes on the story when it should have really started chugging along.As for the gore factor, there is some, but frankly it was not so over the top as might otherwise be suggested. ""American Psycho"" this ain't."
4,"Not as up-all-night-terrifying, but pretty good!","I'm beginning to really like Blake Crouch! After reading ""Run,"" I decided to read another novel by him and wasn't disappointed. The characters are well thought out, as is the plot, and the pace of the book is strong. The ending is rushed just a little --I had to re-read it a couple of times-- but I'm sure that's only to increase the action and excitement. I think this might also be a writing signature of the author, as there was a similarly rushed/abrupt ending to ""Run."" Now that I see its just Blake Crouch's style, I no longer feel the need to criticize this.All in all, a great read and I was surprised to find out from other reviewers that this was his debut novel. Wow!(FYI there is a rather graphic pedophilic sexual assault flashback. If you can't stomach this, you might want to skip this book)"
4,Wow,"i was looking for something interesting to read and stumbled upon this jewel. Its funny that the last review was in 2004 and now its 2012. All i have to say about this book is I am totally hooked on this guys writing. What a great, thrilling, well told story!"
4,Excellent introduction to a couple of sick puppies,"As I got ready to write my review, I noticed 7 1-star reviews and 4 2-star reviews. Where do they come from? The worse rating this excellent book should get would be a 3-star rating.This is my 2nd solo Blake Crouch story, withRunbeing the first. I thought Run was one of the best books I read in 2011. I came into this story having already meet the two main sick puppies, Orson Thomas and Luther Kite when I readSERIAL UNCUT (Extended Edition)in Oct of 2010. I had planned on reading the Andrew Thomas trilogy and when these books became avilable for free in Dec and I jumped at the chance to get these books.I enjoyed the suspense & terror in Desert Places. Yes, Orson is one vicious killer, and he really messed with his brother's mind during this story. The book if full of gruesome killings, but to me, not quite as bad as I read inTrappedby J.A. Konrath. But I can see why Konarth thought he and Blake would work well together based on Desert Places and Run."
1,Sordid crud!,"You may not be interested in my review since I didn't read more than about one fourth of it. The story's sick plot involves torturous killings and the attempt to apprentice a relative into the insanity. The only merit up to the point of discarding the book was the villain's conclusion that writers of such stuff are not too far removed from the insane who do such stuff. This should be good material for wanna-be slashers and the insane who have no problem killing family and friends. Can you imagine the mental process a writer would go through in the development of a story like this. Not healthy, to say the least."
2,This Book Drags On.....,I read this book in 2 days and i thought it was pretty crappy. It starts when a author gets an anoynomous letter that says he he doesn't follow directions he will be framed. So i thought this book won't be so bad. When the author reveals who the villian is it was pretty lame. With just too many brutal murders and too much information not to mention when the villian kills an old lady.(don't want to give it away)Everyone in this book dies not to mention the fact that this killer has no reason why he is doing this in the first place. The hero gets drugged alot no to mention sleeps alot also. The ending made no sense whatsoever. This book just keeps dragging on and on! i guess if you like books with so much detail and not enough significance this will be a great book for you. Signing off ...
1,Snuff movie on paper.,"I enjoy a good serial killer story as much as the next guy, but I have to tell you, this book is so unremittingly violent, it descends to the level of pornography.I'm sure it'll be a big hit."
1,"Slasher, not terror","Based on the writeup, I expected a tense, wrap-your-mind-around-it thriller, instead got a gory slash 'em up piece of tripe. Rather nauseating, no redemming entertainment or satisfaction in reading this. Wish I could return it!"
2,"perverse, gripping tale","Debut or not, the book is a perverse gripping tale of horror....though the central characters are stereotypical of any of the genre, the conversations are well depicted. Not a single chapter in the book is devoid of torture or gruesome details of some murder....it is definetly not a book for light reading. Though the plot reeks of perverse and sadistic-masochistic themes, it is well-written and fast-paced."
3,Little Slow,"I still haven't gotten through this book.It's well written and all, but I find it to move a little slow.When I actually sit down and read it, it's not a BAD read... it's just... not for me, I guess."
3,Very Bloody,This was a very gruesome book with very gory killings . It almost made me sick to read the torture.
2,A disappointing novel.,"The first book that I read by Blake was original and held my interest.For me, Desert Places was a common serial killer book attempting to have depth and psychological significance. I was bored . I could not loose myself in the story.If this is your first serial killer book, then perhaps you may enjoy it."
1,A desert of talent in Desert Places,"The true terror of this book is that it got published. Desert Places is a dumpster-full of slasher, mindless violence upon which the thinnest of innconceivable plots is superimposed. The author and his publisher, Thomas Dunne Books, have confused gore with merit, betting that the book's sadism would pay off in the marketplace. But really, to be more honest next time, the author should dispense with writng that has no merit and simply draw pictures of bloody, tortured captives, guaranteeing immediate appeal for those who liked Desert Places while saving those who found it repugnant, or enjoy reading well-written prose, time."
1,Not Worth It,"In my life there has been only 2 books that I never finished reading. I always hope that the book will get better if I keep on reading. Guess what??? this one made number three (3). First few pages kept my interest until he met his tormentor. After that, it was just a bunch of trash and gore. A person that can kill its own mother does not deserve for me to finish reading the book.Iam sorry that the author debut was not better in my judgement but I hope that his next books are better. Iam willing to give a second chance to his books but not this one or the sequel. I hope this review helps you. Thanks,"
1,Just awful,"This book is just terribly written. The grammatical and word choice errors are only overshadowed by the continuity and logical errors. Not one character acts in a way that you can imagine a real human being acting. There was a tiny nugget of an interesting idea in this book, which is why I slogged through the whole thing. Unfortunately, the book just kept getting worse and worse all the way to the end."
4,For the novice eBayer.,"While much of the information found in this book can be found under eBay's FAQ pages, this book is far better organized and easier to navigate for quick and easy reference. It offers some great ideas and guides for new eBay sellers, such as basic seller etiquette, store management, a breakdown of policies and an understanding of fees, and using your 'About Me' profile to your advantage.I would not recommend the book to a seasoned eBay seller, but if you are new to eBay or like to have quick reference at hand, this book will be an essential guide for you."
3,"Okay, but didn't blow my mind","eBay Income is a decent book if you know nothing about eBay at all, but as someone who has used it quite a bit I found that I didn't really learn anything new once I had finished it. She throws out some helpful links to sites where you can set up a website for yourself, but the truth is that she doesn't tell you anything that you couldn't find yourself by just doing a little Google searching. I imagine this would be an informative read for eBay novices, but for anyone more advanced you would do better to look elsewhere."
5,WONDERFUL,"What a difference! WWI--we don't know much about it, but we learn by bits & pieces. Inspector Rutlege is someone we care about and want to know what happened. I thoroughly enjoyed this. Also, read Rennie Airth and Peter Robinson. I will read more Charles Todd."
3,Good twist,An interesting murder mystery with a flawed detective (Inspector Ian Rutledge suffering from shellshock). The detective and his battle with the past (in the form of his conversations with the dead soldier Hamish) were the heart of the story and really captured the aftermath of the terror of WWI.
2,Missing In Action,"A story line of little interest populated with undeveloped characters that no one, but a mother, would care about. A book with little emotion and no passion. Wrap it up in an ending that is totally irrelevant and you have a book with a lot of potential but no sustaining strength."
4,historical crime fiction,"Todd is an American writer who sets his mystery in early 1900s England, just after the first World War. This one got rave reviews and it's certainly justified. Not a quick, breezy read, but one with depth and layers of suspense. Todd is a talented storyteller, and he also presents the reader with a variety of interesting characters to contemplate ... and suspect. Very well plotted."
2,"Not the best, not the worst","CONS: The pace is a bit slow, the ending is built around a hackneyed mystery gimmick, and the idea of a ""Watson"" as a tortured voice inside the detective's head (created by the psychological scars of WWI shell shock) works better in theory than in practice.PROS: I enjoyed the detective, Rutledge, and his overall likeability, and I appreciated the sort of Golden Age feel that underlies the tone of the work (FYI: There is much more character psychology in this novel than you'd get from a 1930s puzzle mystery, which many modern readers will like while others won't)."
4,willful,Todd weaves an interesting tale of a man haunted by his past. It is a struggle on many levels that keeps the reader wanting to know how will this be resolved.
2,not for me.,"too much sex, not enough mystery.the descriptive sex detracts from the story. i was interested in the murder mystery part of the story."
4,"Good mystery, but great characters","The shell-shocked Scotland Yard inspector who is at the center of this mystery is one of the more interesting detective characters of recent years. His internal dialogues with a dead soldier whose death haunts him are fascinating and work both toward characterization and toward solving the mystery. As for the mystery itself, there are a few too many red herrings sprinkled throughout, but the puzzle is fair is solvable; that part of the story reminded me very much of Agatha Christie's work in terms of the way she laid out the plot and the clues. Highly recommended."
4,Back to Basics,"Although I have read several of the Ian Rutledge series, I started mid way. I'm glad I have now read the first as it provides an even better background and I can see that the character has grown and learned to cope since the initial return to Scotland Yard. It is written well and I think I'll go back and read the others I have missed!Thanks for creating such a great character who is not perfect!"
3,Overrated historical mystery,"This was a much hyped first mystery that has become quite a collectible. A shell-shocked WWI veteran returns to Scotland Yard after the war to investigate the death of a decorated war hero. The author succeeds creating an eerie psychological atmosphere. However, I found his writing to be stilted and struggled to finish the book. The characters did not interest me. This is only Todd's first book and I think he has talent. I look forward to his future efforts."
4,an excellent series begins,This is the first in a series that just keeps getting better. It has been easy to forget the impact World War One had on British society. Rutledge (and Hamish) make that impact very real. The fact that so many of the characters in the book are dead does nothing to keep them from being very vivid. I like my police proceduals to have depth and this one does not fail.
2,Dull and Lifeless,"I can't believe anyone would dare to compare this with the WWI books by Pat Barker. This had absolutely none of the emotional charge those books have. Nor did the people in it seem to have been affected by the war. I never felt anything for any of the characters, including the main character Ian Rutledge. The pace of the book was glacial. The women characters were interchangeable and straight out of a romance novel. I finished the book just to see ""who dunnit,"" and that was certainly a disappointment. I plan to skip any sequels."
3,Fair cozy mystery,"WWI, demons still haunting, and then a typical unremarkable English mystery. I did not unfortunately find this to be the outstanding mystery the reviewers did. I'm afraid I can't quite fathom how it was named one of this century's 100 favorite mysteries. Well-written, but overall not too compelling, and the revelation of the murderer at the end was lackluster and lacked any excitement imho."
3,"Mystery unsatisfying, Background interesting","Although the murder in this debut mystery is somewhat banal, the book is redeemed by its engrossing portrayals of a small English village and the Inspector sent from London to solve the case. Set in 1919, the book's main strength comes in evoking the effect of WWI on both the fragile shell-shocked psyche of Inspector Rutledge, and the small village social structure. The mystery facing the Inspector is fairly baffling on the surface, and relies on a standard old ruse to arrive at a not-so-satisfying solution. Even so, this is a series definitely worth trying out."
3,A little long....,"I enjoy a good murder mystery, and this would have been good if some of the boring details had been left out and some more character development had been included. I found it difficult to really care about the people in the book. The mystery itself was clever, but I had to wade through too much to get to it."
4,Love the cello,"Rostropvich is absolutely fabulous. Heard it originally on the radio, but this record is even better.The only drawback is some unevenness in the reproduction, probably due to the quality of the recording equipment in years past.Wow!"
2,Need wider,I remember wide flat noodles made by Mueller's years ago. Can't figure out why they're not longer available. Hoped these would fill the bill but they do not. The flavor and quality is okay but I would prefer a much wider noodle. They also require such a large order that I am overloaded with bags of noodles! Can't really recommend it.
1,crap,"Okay this movie is utter crap without any plot depth whatsoever. Women not as violent as men? WHAT A BUNCH OF LAUGHS, first off pick up a freaking history book for crying out loud! What about that countess that bathes in her servants blood in order to look young. Certianly not very violent at all.Humans by nature are violent, women are no less violent then men in this regard. Alot of the movie also counterdicts itself by showing that women are indeed as dispicable as men if not more so. Killing off men because they are to violent isn't violent?Whatever. However it is afterall just a movie but it seems that alot of women secretly harbor these very ideals which is extremely desturbing. Maybe they need to go see a shrink?"
2,Can't judge a book by the cover...,I really liked the premise of this book; blue jeans and a badge meets bounty hunter with handcuffs. I was hoping for a fast moving book with lots of sexual tension leading to hot romance. I was bored with this book. I put it down twice before reaching the half way point and once I was there (half way) I just couldn't read any more of it. I have read several other books by this author and have enjoyed them but was disappointed with this one. I did like the cover of the book however.
3,"LIKED IT, BUT....","I enjoyed the story, but I only gave it 3 stars for the following reasons:I like the heroines to be gorgeous, and I understood this heroine to be beautiful as per the book description. But in the book she was described as merely pretty, and the reader is clearly told that though pretty, she is no ""beauty queen"". I especially disliked this fact, because the hero is very often described as so handsome.Also by implication, I assumed that the heroine in this book would have a strong, kick-butt personality. And she did. But shortly after meeting the hero, she turned into a silly and blushing school girl, mostly ruled by her hormones.In the end I felt cheated by the book description."
3,good overall story,"After reading 4 other Nina Bruhns books that I absolutely couldn't put down, I found this one to be lacking. Although its a good storyline and decent character development there wasn't enough drama and suspense that I just had to know right now what was going to happen next."
1,obsolete before read,"c# is not released yet and ms still introduces changes, i.e. a printed language reference is obsolete before even read. for all who are using c# (beta 1), the language reference documentation comes with the package - just look at ""c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio.NET\Vc7\C# Language Reference.doc"""
3,"Ok, but quality issues","Got this jacket and was excited, but after one or two wears, a couple of snaps came off of the hood making me look like an amateur!! :-) Good style, good pockets, just minor quality issue on the detachable hood. Not a deal breaker, but a little disappointing. I WOULD buy again, just because of great price."
4,oderous,"The rubber outside has a bit of an odor, but it is waterproof, great for those cold downpours."
1,Dont waise your money...,"I bought this, and threw it away... It wasnt worth the postage to sent it back to the wherever it came from. The box it came in was lovely... and the earrings looked like cheap pickNsave junk... dont bother with this."
4,Chord Dictionary,It turned out to be a review for me but it is a good reference book for intermediate piano players.
5,A simple resource,"This is a lovely practical guide. Most books on color or on watercolor color never quite get to the point of what you want out of it, which is plain information and palettes of color.The Pocket Palette sets up a palette and clearly shows how each color looks when mixed or glazed (painted over another). There honestly isn't another book of this size and practicality out there. This is not necessarily a book on color theory. It is covered but is not the aim of this at-a-glance, application kind of book.As this book is concise, this review will be concise! This book, plus a color wheel and a short book on color theory (a Walter Foster book will even do) should fill out your arsenal for dealing with watercolor color. (That might seem like a lot, but for a lifetime of using watercolors it is the least you can do for yourself.) This book is an excellent value, even if it is short, and it IS portable, perfect to bring along with your sketchbook and notes."
1,DON'T SEND YOUR MONEY TO SENCO!,"I have recently purchased the Senco SN65C framing nailer. This tool worked fine right out of the box. However, after about 1,200 nails through the gun I blew a seal and had to have the gun rebuilt(at a cost of $125.00). I started a new deck this spring and again, the gun failed with the same problem half way through the project. Thank God my brother owns a Hitachi Nailer for me to borrow!This is the most unreliable nailer I have ever used, for your REAL money's worth buy the Hitachi Full Head Nailer, You won't be disappointed."
1,Senco Framing Nailer,"Senco makes a lot of great nail guns... This is NOT one of them. They should name this gun jamco, because thats what it does, jams! Problem--the tension spring that pushes the nails up is not strong enough so the driver often comes down with the nail not all the way in place. Result--Jam. And often, the nails get so jammed in there that you have to take the magazine off to unjam it (10 minutes). There is nothing worse than prying jammed nails out of a brand new nail gun with a screwdriver! Even using Senco nails, you're lucky to go through 4 strips without a jam! I recently replaced mine with the Hitachi NR83a, (available here for same price), its lighter, smaller, just as powerful, and NEVER jams! (wont shoot 16d commons unless you replace magazine with aftermarket)."
5,BOW-BOW SKI WA-TEN TA-TIN TA-LA HASSSSSSSS,"A must for all serious HHS reunion junkies....but Blumenthal got the picture wrong on the great tree slaughter that occurred circa 1958....several trees were cut down (saw 'em myself one foggy morning upon arriving at school), not just one, so I won't mention the one famous person movie star who Blumenthal attributed this ""prank"" too. I am ordering several copies as gifts to my reunion junkie classmates. Bill Larson, HHS '59"
2,Halloween costume,I would recommend ordering up a size. My son didn't wear the mask because it didn't stay on his head. Jacket was good quality but ran small.
1,Halloween costume,"Purchased this costume for my son. Costume looked good in picture but when it arrived the latex mask was mashed completely flat. Very poor quality, mask wouldn't contour to face and wrinkles where it was folded in shipping would not come out, was unable to use it, ended up throwing it away and buying another mask from halloween shop. Rest of costume was okay at best and made it work. Photos are misleading...don't recommend."
1,Don't waste your money,"This costume is VERY cheaply made...it started falling apart the first time my son put it on. Also, the mask just hangs off the hat, it does not stay put at all. We had to majorly doctor this costume to make it workable for Halloween. I would have returned it, but my son had his heart set on it. I would not recommend anyone buy this costume."
2,Not made very well,The material for this product is very cheap and thin. The spike detail on the shoulders was not centered on the shoulder and we received two right hand gloves instead of a right and left hand glove.Disappointed in this product. Not close to what I expected from the pictures.
3,Biker skull costume,"My son loved this costume. However, the mask did not fit at all. But mostly we purchased it because he wanted to be GhostRider for Halloween and all the real ghost rider costumes were sold out. So, we put the mask in the dress up bucket and painted his face and spiked his hair red and orange and he loved it. The jacket and other accessories were worth the price we paid for the costume."
2,not as good,"I purchased this costume for a party my 7 year old is going to. It, to put it lightly, doesn't look like the picture. The mask is made of flimsy plastic which wont stay around my son's face. I will have to put a piece of elastic around his head to keep it in place. The jacket is supposed to look like leather, not so much. It is a cheap piece of thin vinyl. Overall I am very disappointed I paid 28.00 for this product."
3,Boys Metal Skull Biker Rider Costume,"This costume is not great, but okay. I think one of our main problems was that it was a little too big for my son so it never really fit that great. He was 9 at the time, and I can't recall what size we bought him but it would have been the norm for a 9-year old. The jacket itself is okay, and unfortunately for my son, the gloves that came with it were two left ones so he was only able to wear one of them. He wasn't too keen on the mask either, but then you have to know my son as well. He's a little particular, and because it didn't fit all that well (being only a half mask), he was getting fed up with it after a few minutes. It did the job, though, for the short time he had to wear it."
1,Very Disapointed,"I was so disapointed in this costume. The quality is much like items bought from the Dollar Store. My son tried it on and the collar ripped, the shoulder pieces are not in the right place, the gloves fell apart after wearing them for a couple of minutes, the mask looks nothing like the picture. I was going to send it back for a refund but I will be out the money for the original shipping plus money to ship it back then they want a 15% restocking fee. What a total waste of money."
4,"Toshiba 65"" Widescreen","I have had this TV for 3 years, and it has been a great performer. Very good value for the money."
4,"It's time to do some Major ""wood-shedding!""","It's going to take some time to get used to the medium strength. In high scool, I used the hard, but I do NOT know what the facing was on my mouthpiece. It will take some practice to get the right match again. But I am still well satisfied!"
3,let's remember,"well all i have to say about this record is,(im 29 years old now)back in the 90' i felt so sad about killing the 80' and like the new radicals, figures on a beach give me hope."
3,Functional and basic,"Did a lot of research with Consumer Reports on vcr's as we're in the market for a second one. They don't rate any of them ""excellent"" and only a few get ""very good."" I think this reflects the industry's investment in these machines - just aren't putting the quality into them any more. That being said, this machine works okay for my purposes. So far, no troubles (only 2 months old), it's fairly easy to use, and I do like the ""commercial advance"" and index features. Also, it's fairly compact."
3,Mixed review,"The VCR works well for the most part. (Although the commercial advance feature functions correctly only sporadically) The main reason we give it a mediocre rating is because the remote control, while responding well to the VCR, cannot recognize our TV set. (Magnavox) The company's response to our complaint? Tough luck. Your TV is incompatible."
2,Wrong Manual Loaded Here,"Amazon have the wrong product manual loaded here. The manual linked from this page is for the VR634, not the VR637. The VR637 (this product) does not have commercial advance.The VR637 is an OK VCR, but the SLP recordings are on the fuzzy side. Sound, while OK, is not up to the sound from an unrecorded program (also slightly fuzzy). So not what I would consider a HI-FI VCR.Features are reasonable, but the remote is poorly designed (lots of indistinguishable little buttons, that are all positioned in un-meaningful patterns on the remote). First time that I have had to keep an instruction manual by my chair to refer to constantly, in years.So - overall, score 2 out of 5. An OK VCR for the price (let's get real about what I could expect for this price range). But it's not great quality. I would not buy this model (or probably any VCR from RCA) again."
2,Didn't last,"I will never buy an RCA again. This one lasted only a little more than a year before breaking down. (My last VCR, a JVC, lasted over eight years.) Tapes kept getting stuck in this RCA unit, and I'd have to take the machine in just to get the tapes out. And when I played movies on it, it kept making this loud, annoying, intermittant BZZZZT!! noise, and I couldn't get it to stop.It was a pain...from the get-go, and I spent a little more on this unit than some others cost because I wanted to get a quality item. Hah!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I wanted another VCR, but my RCA is no longer being sold, so I picked this one. Big mistake! It won't recognize my PBS station's time so I have to set the time manually. (All my TVs and other VCRs recognize PBS timewithout difficulty.) And it won't recognize my TV, so I have to use 2 remotes, plus I can't tape the show I'm watching unless I set the timer. And the remote is clunky with tiny buttons, nothing like my older RCA VCR which is great. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk!"
5,Chain Saw chain,"I bought the two pack Poulan 18 inch chains for my Poulan Pro Chain Saw. The price was very good, almost half what I would pay locally. I received the product in a timely manner. Definitely will order again."
5,Chain Saw ChainI ordered throught Am,I ordered through Amazon.com because the place iI purchased the saw had to special order the chain I needed. It would have taken a weak and a 45 mile trip.Amazon had it to me in two days. tThe chain worked just fine.
5,Good value 4 the $,This chain works just as well as others I'vepurchased and is much more reasonably priced.
2,Maybe I got a bad one?,"This Poulan chain just isn't up to scratch - it was creating sawdust not chips and needed excessive force to cut (yes, it was mounted in the correct direction) Maybe I just got a bad one, I don't know, but I do know that I recently put an Oregon bar and chain on my 400E and now it is better than I ever remember it being, even when new. I can't therefore recommend this chain, despite it being inexpensive."
5,"Good saw, try it before you comment","Brough the saw to cut down close to 40 trees that die from last summer. After taking it out of the box, the saw appears to be very cheaply made, as other reviewers have stated, many plastic parts and doesn't look too sturdy. Heard a ""click"" after I pull on one of the handles and wish that I should have brought another saw. But after cutting down five trees so far, the saw is still going strong. The saw is light weight and powerful. So far so good, therefore, the look and feel of the saw can be deceving. A very good saw after all."
2,no life!,Both of them broke within seconds before I could push the vacuum cleaner back and forth several times. So I had to order new ones.
1,horrible,"i have had my hoover windtunnel for several years, and just recently the belt broke. i ordered these belts...the exact model number that is supposed to fit the model vacuum i have. they don't work. they are supposed to be oem...a perfect fit. i have tried both belts that came with this order, and within 2 minutes of running the vacuum they slip off. they are way too tight. these belts should NOT be sold if they are not going to work with the correct model vacuum. VERY DISAPPOINTED. waste of money. not sure what to do now...buy a new vacuum because the hoover belts don't work? ridiculous."
1,These belts do not work well for my Windtunnel 6500,"I have a Hoover Windtunnel 6500 and these belts are very tight and hard to put on. After all the hard work of getting a belt on, it burns out in about a month and all I vacuum is my living room rug since I have hardwood floors. The original belt that came with my vacuum lasted over a year and back then I had carpet. The vacuum is now *very* loud when it never was before. I clean all the hair off the brush and nothing helps. I'm going to try what another reviewer suggested and use the 38528-008 belt since I have nothing to lose."
2,Cheaper at Walmart!,Save a dollar and shipping AND drive to Walmart and buy the package! Delivery was prompt and a good quality product JUST didn't need to order it online.
4,Good Selection & really you need it,"Good Selection.We recently discovered that we would need the belt.We liked the Hoover in the past and lost interest once the belt was out.We bought this and works excellent, the belt is easily replaceable in 5mins.The catch is you would need the belts always in the future as long as you keep this hoover model."
4,It is good.,It gave new life to my vaccuum.for the price it is good.only it is difficult to replace on the unit.
2,"Hoover 38528-033 Windtunnel Drive Belt, 2 Pack","I was a little disappointed in the quality of the product. I put the belt on and with in a matter of seconds after I turned the vacuum on the belt broke, good thing there were 2 belts in the pack so far the 2nd belt is holding up."
1,Want to injure your hands getting this belt on?,"This belt is very difficult to get on the vacuum, in fact a few times I've had it snap back, and found my hand was literally bleeding by the time I was done getting it on. Surely this could be designed better.Also these belts hold up very poorly, I find that I often go through 2-3 a month. I know it's not just that I have a faulty vacuum because this is the second one of the type I've had (my first one actually was faulty so I had to return it, but it had this same problem in addition to other ones). Overall this vacuum (and the belt that goes with it) are very shoddily designed."
4,saved us from buying a new vacuum,"I am so glad this came with two belts. This is the one we are supposed to have with our vacuum, so we know it is the right size. Unfortunately within 10 minutes of putting it on, it broke. Thankfully we had the other one. With the second one we have had no problems and our vacuum works like a charm once again."
4,Though this is the so called correct belt....,"I am a janitor, this belt though the book says it is right for it, is too tight as other reviewer said. I use a slightly bigger belt.hoover 38528-008 or unknown brand but number is 5287 3100603 GR .... if you force the smaller belt sold here, it will break sooner and not work better. I learned through trial and error! This is NOT this company's fault at all, a manufacturing mistake I think. I do hours vacuuming at work, and these other belts work fine on this machine."
3,Tight Belt,"Like the other reviewers have said, this belt is somewhat tight. This belt (38528-033) will fit on but you have to stretch it pretty far - it's hard to get on. My older belt that was broken had 38528-008 written on it and I'm going to order that one and use it so there isn't too much pressure applied on the motor shaft.Update: I ordered the 38528-008 and received it today. This belt is larger diameter and about 1/8"" wider and is higher quality. It goes on easier and doesn't put as much pressure on the shaft. It works like a charm and is definitely the correct belt."
3,not all that great,"i bought this for a dedicated audio listening room on the advice that it was whisper quiet (most important) and could cool the room (2ndary). its absolutely true on the 2nd point, but the thing is not whisper quiet. in fact i moved it to my bedroom and found it noisy enough to disturb my sleep...although it does move a lot of air.a reserved recommendation for this product"
3,"Me, you, youth crew!",This is one of those bands on Revelation that probably get more interest than is necessary because of who their peers were. They have one song that's good.That's it. You don't need this unless you're obsessed with some youth crew credentials that don't matter. Buy the Supertouch record.
4,Jingles,"It is very pretty and very different, however, when I wear it, it makes a jingle or ""clinking"" sound. It kinds of sits on my chest like a lump because of it's shape. Sort of awkward. Yet, when I look at it I think ""That is REALLY pretty"". Obviously, I have mixed feelings about it!"
2,satisfied after being disappointed at first,I was a little disappointed with my purchase however the customer service was great when I complained. They even went as far as giving me a full refund. I understand that mistakes do happen but when a company stands behind their produces it means a lot to me. Because of the customer service I will shop with them again.
5,Sophisticated Yet Modern,I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend. The amber cube is definitely a unique eye-catcher. My girlfriend loved it and has received many compliments on it. A coworker said she was distracted at a meeting because she kept admiring her necklace. The construction appears to be of high quality and has a good weight to it. As it does not come with a chain I would recommend the following if you don't have one:http://www.amazon.com/SN030DC-Nickel-Italian-Sterling-Necklace/dp/B000GVMK8S/ref=pd_sbs_jw_1The item arrived carefully packaged with a certificate of authenticity for the amber. If you are purchasing this as a gift I highly recommend their inexpensive gift-box. It came in a little red box with a cute white bow wrapped around it.It was delivered well ahead of schedule. I had ordered this in the afternoon and noticed it was shipped later that same day.
4,unique shape,"of course there is not much to say about it.i like the color, the unique shape and the size.so simple n elegant.i also got the earings but was not as good as this."
5,Nice!!!,"I've always been a Tyler Perry fan and was this play didn't disappoint. I love how things work out for the good in the end for all involved. The singing, the humor, was great!!!!"
2,Not worth the purchase,"The DVD is not worth purchasing or watching. A horrible story line. It will put you to sleep. If you just have to watch it, rent from a video store."
5,laugh to keep from crying,"Oh my goodness, good video i have watched it over and over the music is awsome. i can't wait to play it over the holiday when my family comes to town"
3,Requested feedback,This is entertaining on a slow day. i mean when there's nothing else to do.I have seen the actors in better movies/plays. I order a lot of movies because of cultural loyalty.
3,Pretty funny escape,This play was well worth the few dollars I paid for some laughs. There's some good singing and the storyline is pretty interesting. This is something that could be developed into a movie or a series with the right writers.
5,"As always, wonderful!!",I love Tyler Perry's movies. This one was play I rented. I didn't realize it was a play until I started watching it. I am so glad I rented it and plan to buy it too.The end when Tyler Perry came out was unbelievable. Rent or buy it and you won't regret it. He has a God given talent and chooses people with talent to be in his movies and plays.
5,Keeps me laughing,This movie is very interesting and keeps you laughing as well as in suspense on a couple of scenes. Really enjoyed this movie and I have loaned it to a friend as well.
2,Dislike it,"I think this was my lease favorite play of all time by Tyler Perry. It had a good meaning but it was not funny, and the girl (cant think of her name) that played the daughter was so annoying! I do not recommend this play unless you have a Tyler Perry collection you want to add this too."
2,Kind of a letdown :(,"I was a little bummed. Usually I find myself laughing from start to finish, but not this time. Just MY opinion; there were some good laughing times but ALOT more singing than there usually is."
3,hang up boots for 850 teeter inversion table,"I purchased the Teeter 850 inversion table and found the set up for locking your ankles in to be very uncomfortable when completely inverted.Then I purchased the gravity boots and found those to be not much better,after about 10 minutes of complete inversion your ankles start to hurt because the lack of blood flow and presure on your ankles. I'm still using the boots hoping that I will get use to them.T, Ohio"
1,Far too small for a large men,"These boots are far too small for many tall men or for those with some weight or muscles in the lower leg.The product should be marked "" small to medium ""."
5,Comfortable,"You get what you pay for and you might as well pony up and buy these if you're serious about ""hanging around"". I think they'd probably work with any inversion table and I use them for inverted crunch's with no discomfort at all."
5,"Abs, Obliques, and even inverted squats.","If your looking to add some excitement and soreness to your already all encompassing abdominal workout, try these! If your over weight and cant do pull ups definitely not recommended, it requires you to be able to get your leg up pass your head."
2,Hurt Ankles,I read the views and saw where some people where saying they were having trouble with the ankles while other said they were great. I can tell you I weight 170 and I'm in great shape and when I put these on to invert they really hurt my ankles. They are unusable. I don't see how anyone could away from the not hurting like crazy when inverted.
4,Works Great,These gravity boots are well made and get the job done. They are durable and fit great. The only complaint I have is they can get a little uncomfortable on the tops of your feet the longer you hang upside down. If they just put some more padding or perhaps some bracing over the top of the feet it would be more comfortable.
4,Great for Hanging up side down with,the boots are exactly what they are advertised. I love using them to just hang upside down with and letting my spine stretch out
5,Get's the job done.,"This product is of good quality and performs as advertised. I'm 5'9"" and 215lbs. and I use it to invert to perform inverted situp's (the normal variety hurt my back), inverted squats, for hamstring strength and balanced leg development and to stretch out my spine. I've been nothing but happy with them."
5,bat,"It feels great working out upside down.Can't cheat with these boots on.Try doing clean and curl upside down,and you will fall off.It feels good on my back also."
3,Not with EP-950,Boots looked like they would work well and were made well. They do not work with the EP-950 however. I noticed small print in manual after I had purchased them that declared that. I tried everything I could think of to get them to work but to no avail. According to the manual the conversion bar won't work either. I did find that karate foot pads work great to ease the pressure on the feet. Glad I kept them around over the last 20 years.
2,Not worth the price or effort,"I tried these just after I purchased my inversion table. My ankles would hurt while hanging upside down, so I thought this might alleviate that problem. These were way too awkward and clumsy. I went back to not using the gravity boots and just decreasing the amount the table tilts to lessen the pressure on my ankles."
5,Gravity Boots,"My husband swears by them, and says that they do wonders for his spine, and so my son, who is a physical therapist, wanted some for himself, too!! His birthday is tomorrow, but he tried his dad's and wanted some for himself. We have the drop down hand hold bar for the doorway, and we recommend getting both. Joy, Kim"
5,Great Product!,"I bought just the boots with hopes of it working with my Perfect PullUp bar mounted in one of my doorway frames. The two products will work together if you cut the foam padding off the PullUp bar.As some of the other reviews of this product have stated, if you do not have fairly strong abdominal muscles already, these boots are not for you. Get a table instead.After 5 months doing 3 sets of 15 inverted sit ups twice a day, my back feels wonderful, I have sculpted abs, a tighter butt and my knees feel great! At 6-1, 225lbs and 45 y/o I feel like 30 again! I recommend wearing socks when using, the foam will ""bite"" into your skin a bit. As far as adjusting the tightness of the straps goes, leave the one closer to your foot a little more loose than the other. It's one of those things you have to figure out on your own."
5,Taking Film on The Cruise/Airlines,"Very handy. Most places CLAIM the xray machines will not damage your film. That may be true if is only done once and not highspeed film. I kept the film pack in hand while going through check points and ask for hand inspection, a couple of times when they were busy I was denied a hand inspection and ran film packet through exray."
2,Not really what I expected.,"I was looking for a different book about a dr. not this particular book; however, I did not want to see my money wasted and read the book anyway. It had a good theme but I was not expecting to be reading about religion. Much of the book is religious and I was not reading it to learn the steps toward salvation. The plot is good and of coarse and I did expect it to come together the way it did. I would not recommend this book to anyone that is just looking for a western to read."
5,Get this cd now!,"Sam Baker is the best new songwriter anywhere, period. Every roots musician is raving about this guy, and it's easy to see why. A smart, acoustic based wordsmith that will bring John Prine to mind. His life's story will floor you too if you look into it. He was actually blown apart by a bomb overseas. He's one hell of a human being; a true inspiration to us all. You can find this at cdbaby or from Bull Creek Productions. Expect his sophomore later this year."
1,Toshiba 62HM95 DLP,2 months after my warranty the same things happened! I have wavy lines in the bottom right of my screen.

3,"Byron Cage ""Faithful to Believe"" Video","I previously bought Byron Cage's ""Faithful to Believe"" CD and enjoyed the music so much I wanted the DVD. I was a little disappointed in the quality of DVD because the voice track didn't match the picture so that when you heard people speak the video showed them speak a second or two later. This flaw made it OK to watch. Maybe it was the copy I received."
4,A look at the mythology created by GWTW in England.,"This is an interesting examination of how fascination with Gone With the Wind has affected the lives of women in Britain. But the book has accurate and enlightening biographies of the stars as well, and an examination of issues presented by both film and novel. A good read for anyone interested in this novel as a phenomenon of pop culture."
5,The most fun CD I own,"Of the more than 100 rock, blues, jazz and classical CD's I own, this is probably my favorite. I always feel better after listening to it. I happened to see the band live outdoors in a rather small setting, and it was one great experience. The vocalists, Sam Llanas and Kurt Neumann, are outstanding. It is sad these guys don't have a huge following."
5,"Lost it, Found it, lost it, found it--LOVE IT","I've owned and lost this album many times. I just bought it again for $2 at the local music shop. There are no bad songs-only, well, a little more dull, like Beaujolais, but oh well.These songs have stood the test of time. This is real, basic rock and roll. And that's a good thing in this case. I'll pick Brand New as my favorite; if that really matters.The lyrics are beautiful slices of life about hope and boredom and liquor and drugs and missing your lover (and love and hope and sex and dreams).I saw them in about '87 at school in Madison, WI. They didn't change for the worse, or get electronica or sumpin' stupid.They're just keepin' it real (yo). Thanks guys."
5,Fantastic,The Bo Deans show an unbeatable emotional range dealing with life's highs and lows that matches with the basics of Rock n Roll.This is among their finest that never settle for anything half-hearted or cheap.
4,Qestionable Quality Control,"I purchased the FP650 from Tool Crib. Right out of the box, the metal tip on the the front of the feeder shoe, which prevents the nailer from dry firing, was broken off and floating around in the box. Tool Crib exchanged the tool. The second tool had the same exact problem. I returned it as well, and asked for my money back. It just happened that my local Home Depot started carrying Senco Nailers. After opening two boxes, I finally bought the nailer. The tip of the feeder shoe on the first nailer was missing and the second nailer I purchased. The nailer works great, but I worry about having to replace the feeder shoe down the road."
4,Good - Could be better,"Really like the nail loading and ability to easily clear jams. Easily loads nails ranging between 2 inch and 3-1/4 inch without tools. Need two different tools to change settings. Senco could include a tool to do both tasks with a large clip to keep it from getting lost. Took some fiddling to learn how to unload partial nail sticks to load with a new size. Not exactly intuitive. Overall, a quality tool."

1,SO Very Disappointing!,"I had high hopes for this and it was sooooo bad I had to return it!Awful, no music, very very little instruction.And those girls in the back, the one looks like a deer in the headlights and very poor formDon't waste your time or money seriously!"
4,I would give this 4.5 stars...,"This is an awesome get started DVD. I do wish they had more of a section on how to pick out your first kettlebell and also how to prevent slippage while using the kettlebell.I did like the fact that there was no cheesy music to accompany the workout so I can just throw my own music on that I want.I kinda' wish that the choose your own workout option had a way to program a workout instead of having to flip through the menus to pick and choose which workouts to do.Other wise, an awesome workout that will give you great results. :)"
2,I don't think this workout deserves all the accolades,"I honestly don't think this is a good workout. The workout claims to be over two hours long but much of that is recyled. For all workouts, the same warmup and cool down are used which cuts the amount of this DVD down quite a bit. I didn't find any of the workouts particularly difficult and the lack of music makes the already bland instructor even more dull. Actually this should be under""one star"""
2,Disappointed,I have Michele Khai's DVD which has a 45-min. workout to music. This DVD did not have any music and I had to keep FF it because each segment stops. Plus the segments were the same and instructions were poor. I used it once and then trashed it.
2,Kettlebell Goddess Workout,"I was doing fine until I somehow did it wrong & strained my right bicep. The pain lasted a long time & finally went into my shoulder, which pops out & in with some pain. I haven't been inclined to do thos workout again, yet. Maybe someday when I feel 100%."
1,Very poorly done,"Very poorly done, I take kettlebell classes & the instructors are 100 times better than this DVD. They were off count & it was very unprofessional."
1,Do Not Recommend,"I think this workout was very poorly done. We're relatively new to Kettlebells, but I think there are much better motivational workout DVDs out there. G. Miller is a good example of a well done DVD. The Goddess workout was actually very creepy. She starts by saying the excercise that will be done and begins to do the excercise in total silence even without any music playing (and her daughters? are working out behind her in silence too) and all you can hear is this freaky breathing by all of them. Only bright side is that there were some new excercises that I've never tried before, but I'll do them on my own, never watch this DVD again. But it's a complete rip off for your money."
4,Wish it were programmable.,"I wish the dvd's segments were programmable, but I do love the workouts. They are quick so you can do as little or as many as you want. I know there are no cues, but that makes it a good kettlebell workout for me. There is a tutorial and other extras, but once you have the form down, the workout is great."
2,Kettlebell Goddess Workout,"I bought this DVD several months ago and I just can't get into it. There is nomusic and all you hear is breathing. The workout itself is probably very similarto others but without music, there is no enjoyment in the workout. I would notrecommend this to anyone and I probably will give it to goodwill."
1,Not thrilled,"I go this DVD in hopes that it would be something I could exercise to, but it was very dry and didn't make me want to have fun and do a workout. It's probably great for instruction, but not something you watch for too long."
3,Basic but creepy,"This was my first exposure to a kettlebell workout. While it does a good job of teaching kettlebell basics, it gave me the creeps. The instructor's informative but awkward. And speaking of awkward, one of the other women in the video is incredibly focused which comes off as odd and creepy. Home workout videos are something that are watched over and over again. I can only do this video every now and then because these women are all peculiar."
1,TOO SLOW!,"I tried this video since it is the top rated and most reviewed Kettle bell workout, however, this video is too slow. She explains every single move step by step to the point where you stand waiting for instructions.Kettle bell workouts should be fast paced where you use cardio and weight training at the same time.This was a HUGE disappointment for me."
3,Hard Stuff,"I like this DVD because you can customize your own workouts. Be prepared, this is tough and I am only using a ten pound kettlebell! I have not have the nerve to try any of the complete workouts. I usually do a session of abs, arms, and legs..that is plenty! If I can ever get myself to progress to the longer sessions (and I am hoping to do that this winter), I know I will see a difference! This is the only DVD that I have found with the short workouts that you can combine into a customized one for yourself. For that alone, I recommend this DVD! My only complaint is that there is not enough explanation (or even counting) during the workouts. I could use the help because three people are doing the exercises in slightly different ways. In addition, I like to know that how many reps I have done, so that I will not give up!"
1,very disappointed in this DVD,"This DVD is very disappointing. First, the workouts do not have music. Listening to the breathing and grunting is bad enough but add in the counting of the people off camera and it's very enoying. The biggest problem I have with this DVD is the lack of instruction. There is a quick tutorial at the beginning to explain some of the moves and that's it. She does not give any explanation on how to do the moves during the workouts. It's just breating and grunting. NO talking. If you have received prior in depth instruction on kettlebell moves then this DVD may work for you. If you are like me and have used kettlebells some, or not at all, DO NOT waste your money on this DVD. I wish I would not have."
2,3.5 years not long enough,"After 3.5 years of TV enjoyment our Toshiba 53"" just bought the farm. Although, there is power to the set there is no picture. Toshiba has advised other customers the sets guns need replacing every 4 years. I have not had a qualified repair technician investigate the repair but expect the cost will be high not to mention if you have this set built in like we did the cabinet needs to be disassembled first. My next TV will not be made by Toshiba."
3,"Decent, cheap BASIC hairdryer","This is a VERY basic hairdryer. It has no attachments, and no heat control. It also has only 2 fan speeds. Other than that, it does what it is suppose to do - dry hair. If you want a cheap, basic hair dryer, this serves the purpose."
3,Not bad,"A good sturdy basic hair dryer that has lasted me a long time, but has no helpful attachments for styling. Ok if you just want to dry your hair and style it in some other way."
2,Be careful of defect,"I've had this dryer for over a year. It worked well enough. Then, one time when I went to use it, the handle became very hot, sparks started shooting out of the front of the dryer, and then smoke. I have contacted Conair to see if this is a specific problem for this dryer. So far, I have not heard from them."
2,Postmortem review,"This movie could have been awarded five stars because Charlie Sheen was in it. However, two stars were given in the interest of fairness.Charlie's performance was dragged down by a lacklustre supporting cast and a plot which was mildly interesting at best.I loved the scenery though and the fact that Charlie got to drive around Scotland in a hot car (was it a black Lamborghini?)My review, however, may not be worth the paper it was not written on because I would happily pay good money to watch Charlie Sheen recite the alphabet."
1,another Albert Pyun stink bomb,"To my knowledge, Albert Pyun has a record of doing bad movie: Crazy Six, Adrenalin Fear The Rush, Cyborg and many others, though Mean Guns is his best work. Here he does another crappy job with who, you might say..Charlie Sheen (Tv's Spin City, The Big Bounce) of all people. Sheen plays a was been cop who got divorced and he has a booze problem. He also has written a book on about serial killers. Things dont happen until the cops find the first body in the garden and it seems interesting but the mind decieves and it turns out to be a pile of waste. The Killer is a necrophiliac and likes to lay with the bodies and so forth....wow, I think. Sheen drops his booze binges and helps out the cops. Wall to wall stupidity. Very predictable. The end where Sheen is running after the guy is hilarious. They both seem to run like Steven Seagal or something. Also starring Ivana Milicevic (I think she is a model of some sort) and Michael Halsey (Mean Guns, Tv's Angel)."
1,1 ARCH COMPUTER,"Just a word about my about my buying experience dealing with ""1 Arch Computer"". Purchased Crucial Memory which possible would be compatible with other computers, but in my application it was not. Have used ""Crucial Memory"" in the past with great success. Tied to explain this to 1 Arch Computer but their only solution was to exchange memory for the same. Their solution according to ""Computer Techs"" where I brought my computer for repair would not resolve problem. I was Not looking for a ""Refund"" but only a credit for a new purchase from 1 Arch Computer. ""Trish"" a supervisor with 1 Arch Computer refused, claiming we are not able to ""budge"" even a little from their 30 day return policy."
4,Computer Memory,Product arrived in a timely manner and worked as advertised. Price was very reasonable. I am pleased with this purchase.
3,"Lupus: The Facts by Dr. Graham Hughes (Oxford, England)","Lupus: The Facts, provides alot of much needed information for the Lupus patient. The facts were a bit over simplified and some of the more rare symptons (such as Lupus and Hives) are not addressed. I found Dr. Wallaces Lupus book much more in depth and informative for the money."
4,Exotic Flair,"There are six pre-cut stencils in this sturdy little book. The designs are boldly outlined, and detailed without being unmanageable. The birds are easily recognizable, but also neatly labeled on the pull-out pages. I used them with fabric paints to make a set of sheets and pillowcases, but you'll find other uses, lots of other uses. Depicted in this book are a peacock, a pelican, a toucan, a flamingo, a parrot, and my favorite, the cockatoo."
1,"Washroom wall précis of ""Money and the Meaning of Life""","Current events contribute to the genius of pulp prose. The larger lesson made evident by the Katrina hurricane disaster as well as the recent but already forgotten corporate corruption scandals is that both events had to happen as both meteorologists and economists prophesied they would. Our short sighted judiciary paralyzed but conflicting motives did nothing. So I would say this book proves that, along with staring at the sun too long, money causes blindness."
5,Extraordinary... provided you can *really* understand it.,"This book is extraordinary. Literally. It takes a mercyless look at the ""unbalanced"" importance human beings are giving to money nowadays, particularly in the american society. Needleman himself describes his most intimate feelings towards the power of money, and this he does objectively, corageously, without lie and -most important- with enlightning. Unfortunately I guess, not a tenth of the readers will be able to fully appreciate the unvaluable ideas (in fact many of them were new to me) contained in this book. If you are ready to stop self-deceiving as what to the incidence of money in your life refers, or if you already have, then you should read this book, no matter what."
1,Not that great,"Needleman had some interesting stories but I didn't find the book all the helpful or entertaining. I had to read it for class and the only good part about the assignment was the class discussions, most of which had little to do with the actual book. I thought it had potential and I was excited about reading this book but ended up being dissappointed. It is a VERY easy book to read and you can fly through the pages. I ended up reading a lot and not really understanding or getting anything from what I just read."
1,A philosophy professor's lecture and lunch conversation,"A rambling, self-important, name-dropping, and pretentious work that I forced myself to finish. The literary device of focusing on discussions with two fictional students during much of the book was annoying and an easy way to increase page count without requiring serious rigor. I have just started Galbraith's 'Money'; it seems much more robust, though admittedly of a slightly different focus."
2,Full of himself,"I purchased this book on the basis of other reviews, and then thought those reviewers were from a different planet when I got into it.Some of the things the author recalls made me think ""What a Jerk"" -- why treat people like that? Turned me off so much I figured: ""Why should I be interested in anything this guy has to say about the important subject he has taken on?""He seemed like a five year old trying to tackle an NFL fullback one on one."
2,Not too helpful,"I really didnt find answers to anything regarding the meaning or essence of money. Only the authors confused philosophy. He is obviously brought up in a Jewish household which holds money tantamount to the highest esteem one can get from life. Money is an energy, nothing more. I dont want to hear anymore neurotic ramblings on about this subject from this guy."
4,"What's ""better"" Than Needleman?","I've read this book a couple of times, and yes, I agree with my friends that the writing is a bit weak at the beginning--but the whole is very very strong. Needleman is excellent: catch his occasional lectures at various venues in SF. Overall, I think the notion that money developed in spiritual communities for the sake of handling material needs in an efficient manner is valid. I've handed this book out to many friends, and frankly, other than Michael Phillip's The Seven Laws of Money, there are not that many worthwhile titles out there. The landscape is filled with incrediblly preposterous junk like Suze Ormon."
1,Expert Weapon,"I was very disappointed with Expert Weapon.Sam Jones was great in Flash Gordon but in this movie well i think he should have left it alone.The acting and fighting scenes were so stupidly made,it was like as if a actor was standing there waiting to be hit.This is the type of film that reminded me of the early '80's low and cheap. Please do not waste your money on a low budget film like this.Rent it or look for a diffrent type of action film."
2,Not what i expected...,I expected it to suck the gunk out of my skin...Or at least bring it close to the surface so that i could easily take it off....it didn't..too bad for me.
5,Courteous problem resolution,"I had ordered a book by Margaret York, ""Safely to the grave"" in October 2011 from the Pbshop, along with many more, which were delivered promptly. Unfortunately the book was misprinted with blank pages, and I made a complaint with Amazon and Pbshop. With very courteous communication, a full refund was made (albeit to a expired creditcard, which I forgot to manage in my payment account, sorry, my fault), so I have still all the confidence to order again with Amazon and Pbshop for some more books by Margaret York, for they are fascinating reading!Thanks for the great resolution of this problem.RDB"
3,Tired of Harry Potter? Try Philem Green!,"This young adult fantasy set in 1919 England grabs you right away. The hero of our story, Phelim, awakens one morning to find his kitchen filled with glashans, a people who are normally invisible to humans. The glashans want Phelim to help them, for the Worm is waking, and as she does, her Hatchings are wreaking havoc across the country. Phelim is quite confused at first, but with the help of a Fool, a Maiden, and a Horse, he discovers that he seems to be their only hope to stop the Storr Worm and prevent her strange, blood-thirsty hatchings from harming anyone else. Phelim has a lot to learn about these creatures and stories that died out generations ago but begin to surface again, as he journeys to kill the giant monstrous worm. How will he do it? He hasn't got a clue."
2,pages unreadable,"The book was used, which I didn't realize, but was acceptable. Once I started to read it I discovered there are multiple pages with printing so washed out they are mostly unreadable. I was disappointed that it was not screened better before re-sale."
1,The belt burned out after only a few uses.,"I have also had problems with the belt on this vacuum. It burns out after only a couple of uses. Also, the belt size is difficult to find and cost twice as much as other belts. I would not recommend this vacuum."
2,did I get a lemon?,"I purchased this vacuum after much research. It was heavy, but worked great, even along baseboards, for the first few months. Then I moved, stored it for a few months and when I began to use it again -- just a few days after the one-year warranty expired, it broke. Cost me more than $90 to repair it at a Eureka authorized dealer. It broke again almost immediately. I fixed it again. This vacuum was not abused and overused [it's been suggested by some smart-aleck friends that it died from LACK of use!]. I live in small quarters -- always less than 1000sf and have a 50-50 mix of tile and carpeted floors. Also, if you have vaulted ceilings, it's a real stretch to reach that high with the attachments; even getting the cobwebs from a regular height ceiling isn't easy. I still have this two-year-old vac, but would be afraid to purchase it again. I sure miss my [very] old eletrolux that never broke, but I admit I wonder if I didn't just get a lemon with this one."
4,Worth Every Penny,"This vaccum is wonderful! I found it to be heavier than it looks, but I'm used to it now. It's easy to change the dirt bag too, which I think is important. The design of the hose is convienient too. Very eay to clean the cobwebs off my ceiling now! I found that the hose tools fall off of the places where they are supposed to attach on the back of the vaccum, but it wasn't a big deal to me, as I hardly use them. The noise level is a little louder than I expected. Also, the light that is on the front of the vaccum is up to high to really be of any help. The coolest thing is the different floor settings. They work great. Overall, this is the best vaccum I've ever owned."
4,A good vacuum,"This is a good vacuum, but it does not go underneath a bed where the dust bunnies live - I guess a canister vacuum would be a better choice for that. It is also a bit on the heavy side. The good thing is that it has great suction. You can really feel it when you are pushing/pulling it across the floor because the suction is pulling at the floor, so you can get a bit of a workout when the weight is combined with the suction. But since you want really clean floors, all that suction is a good thing. The clear tubing makes it easy to see when you suck up something that you shouldn't."
5,OUTSTANDING !!!,LOVE IT...LOVE IT. It moves me... all I have to do is guide it. All new carpets and all those little pieces of carpet only came up if I pick it up. Had a Dirt Devil and KNEW there had to be better!!! I feel like this one cost at least $1000.00. AND it was under $150.00.HAPPY! HAPPY!
3,belts breaking,"In many ways this is a nice machine. The problem we have had with it is ""long life"" belts that are expensive and break continually. If anything gets sucked up while the brush is engaged, the belt burns out. Also, it would be nice if the switch were on the handle so you could turn off the machine when things go wrong."
5,Awesome Vacuum for All Floor Types,When I bought this vacuum I was looking at a Hoover that according to consumer reports is rated one higher than this one but at twice the price. I have all hardwood floors on the main level and all carpet for the downstairs and I wanted a vacuum that would be able to do both plus the stairs but not being to heavy to carry up and down. This vacuum has it all easy to switch between the carpet and hardwood a nice feature is that the brush turns off automatically when you switch it so that you do not scratch the floors. The power of the suction is more than enough to pick up anything. There is little to no effort when using it also there is no need to get a direct drive vacuum it is not very hard to most glides on the floor and carpet. This is finally a vacuum where you can watch the game and some can be using it very quite. Overall I have suggested this vacuum to my friends and family.
5,Supervac,"I am a retired Mr. Mom and for some crazy reason into vacuumcleaners! I bought this vacuum based on consumer reports reviewand think it is great. Excellent cleaning, good tools and very good features. It pulls my wife around the house when she uses it! My only negative comment is the handle could be a little longer.... I am very happywith this purchase."
5,I will never buy another brand vacuum again!!,"I can't say enough about this vacuum!! The sucktion is exelant, cord is long enough, and it does a superb job on all kinds of floors!! I use it to clean houses. All of my clients love this vacuum as well, because it is not loud and they don't have to stop their lives while waiting for me to clean their house!"
2,Eureka 4870 Ultra Smart Vac,I brought this vaccum after doing some research on vaccums. Read other peoples opinions on this vaccum. Thought this would be a good vaccum for the money. I was wrong. It is very heavy to carry upstairs. When you go to use the tools it cloggs up all the time causing it to shut off. The bags are more expensive then most bags and can only be found at a vaccum store. They are harder to install and keep in place. When the bag slips out of place it causes everything to go outside the bag making a big mess to clean up. I will give it credit it does do an excellent job on carpets. Looks like I will be looking for a new vaccum again. After only having this one for 3 months.
2,Great at first... But,"This vacuum worked great until I caught a ribbon one day and ever since, it's been querky. When I turn it on the brush will not turn until I bang the head against a hard object then it goes to town (until I have to unplug and start all over again. Now, the motor seems to be turning the belt drive, but the belt tightener is not pressing on it to tighten. If this belt problem (and as the other negative reviewer noted -A quick release to change the belt) was fixed, this would be a great unit."
2,belt slips and burns out,"I bought this as a floor demo via eBay in 2002. The beater bar would bog down on carpet. I put duct tape on the bar to increase tension. That helped for a while. The vacuum shop installed a new base (at my expense) which didn't help. Now the belt is continually burning out. Apparently Consumer Reports has never tested the ""bad version"" that slips and burns belts. It's a pretty good vacuum otherwise."
1,Good gone VERY bad,"Using reviews from AMAZON and Consumer Reports, we bought this vac two years ago. It was very heavy for me and I am a very large person. Almost since new, belts have been a problem, and now, even a new belt will not spin the brush. The ""help desk"" will not admit any issue with belts or tensioners, despite this being a universal complaint for all owners shortly after purchase. According to the service center, the non adjustable, poorly designed, belt tensioning mechanism and flimsy belt fails with regularity on these vacs. The part costs $35. and installation, another $49. Save your money. Why pay to replace a flawed part that is destined to fail again. Also we have experienced all other typical problems such as failure to retain hose, which keeps falling off retainer. This is VERY annoying. Consumer Reports should consider ownerEureka 4870MZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright HEPA Vacuum Cleanerexperiences with this poorly designed product, since my experiences are typical for this junker."
1,dissapointing,"This CD gets 1 star for 1 good song.I only have 1 other RCM CD,,Midnight Rose's and I had hoped this 1 would be as catchy and funky as that.It's not!!!!Silver Street is the only good song.I will never buy another RCM CD without hearing it first."
2,Not for the roads less traveled,"This map was a big disappointment. Many of the smaller streets are not identified at all, and that's exactly the information that you'll want when you get lost trying to leave the Grand Bazaar, as we did last week. It was also unfortunate that the map did not include even a small picture with an overview of the whole of Istanbul. This is something that even the cheap paper maps at the airport were equipped with. Istanbul has many parts worth visiting beyond Sultanahmet and Taksim, but this map won't help you get there. On the plus side, it was durable, held up well, even when folded up small to fit in my pocket, and if you stick to the major roads and neighborhoods, it's useful for navigation."
2,Compact size with minimal detail,"While this is a good map to consult predeparture as you read your tour books, the lack of labels for most of the streets will mean you have to look elsewhere for the detail required when actually navigating them. I've had good luck with other Fleximaps but this one leaves much to be desired."
5,istanbul map,"Estremely helpful and east to use, I carried it with me.All major and some minor sights highlighted."
4,Insight Fleximap Istanbul,Looking forward to using this handy map as we travel through Istanbul and view the sights. Map came in a very timely fashion.
2,Clunky iPod interface,"I bought this radio for the iPod integration. I should have chosen another model, as the interface is rather clunky. If you have a large playlist, you have to keep pressing one button until you find the one you want. Also, it may not work with newer iPods and iPhones, so there's that to consider."
1,worst auto audio receiver ever,"I purchased one of these with an expectation of quality due to the Sony name, but within 2 months it ceased to function properly, failing to eject CDs. Sony replaced it with another, which also failed in 2 months. Sony replaced it with a third, which also failed in 2 months. Now Sony says it's out of warranty and refuses to provide a different model unless I help to pay for it, offering only to provide a 4th unit of the same kind.I've had a number of auto audio receivers over the years, but never such a defective and unreliable unit. I expected far more than I received, and I'm totally unimpressed with Sony quality and customer ""support"". This machine eats CDs and has provided a remarkably poor level of performance. Nothing but headaches and disappointment with this one."
4,???????,"I personally thought this was a pretty good book. All the way through, it was interesting and kept me stuck to it. It tells about how Steve Harmon, a teenager from Harlem, is falsely accused of being involved in the murder of a store-owner. I thought it was and interesting point of view, and that's what helped make the book. The events that happened in the court were recorded by Steve in the form of a movie. It also had parts that told what Steve was thinking. I thought it was a good book that is worth reading, if nothing else, for the point of view it gives you as a kid trying to grow up in Harlem."
5,Monster by Walter Dean Myers,The book Monster was a very interesting book. It is about a 16 year old named Steve that is on trail for the murder of a drug store clerk. He is writing about his experience in the form of a movie script and plans to go back to film school after the trial is over to make his movie. I have read some of Walter Dean Myers' other books like The Righteous Revenge of Artemis Bonner and Slam! They where both good books but I think this was the best out of all of them.
5,''Monster madness'',Monster is about steve harmon from harlem he is on trial for murder.His role is to tell them if it's clear.He was not in the store at the time of the shooting.So you're probably thinking he's inecint but the judge may not think so.You will need to read it to find out .I am not done with it but I'll finish. ''5 Big stars''
3,Very Unique and Interesting,"Imagine you are sitting in a court room on trial for FELONY MURDER! Hard to believe right? Well, theres no imagining for Steve Harmon. It's all real for him. He's only 16 years old and in jail. He goes to court everyday with everyone hating him. The prosecuter even called him Monster. He's on trial for the murder and robbery of a drugstore and clerk in Harlem. Hes in the court room with many people however he is all alone and scared all the time. So did he do it? At 16 years old, is his life now ruined? The only way to find out is by reading Monster by Walter Dean Myers. I liked this book and I felt it was very unique. It is written as a movie screenplay that Steve is writing during his trial. If someone were to read this book I believe that they would enjoy it and I bet it would really make them think because it really did make me think. Its a good book."
3,Monster,"I think this book is good. It`s about a guy named Steve and he is on a trial for murder. On December 22, somebody got shoot in the drugstore and they are trying to figure out who it was. they suspect that it was Steve, Mr.Bobo or Mr.King. The one who shoot the guy who was working in the store took two pack of cigarettes too. O`brien is Steves lawyer. She is trying to help Steve to get out of the case but it`s still like she doesn`t belive Steve. The police takes Steve to jail. He has to sleep there. Steve thinks it`s scary to be in jail because all the other guys are fighting and talking about what they have done and that makes Steve feel bad because he didn`t do anything. Steve said he wasn`t in the drugstore on December 22.So later they found out that Steve wasx not guilty. He wasn`t even in the store on December 22."
4,monster,I review this book as a great bbook cause the book leaves you in alot of susspense and the book is very intersesting and then the book is very good it like a true story.
3,Murder,"Steve Harmon a young, sixteen-year-old boy has ben charged with a ""heavy"" crime.....Murder. The book is about his struggles during the trial, in jail, and his life. He has flashbacks about what happen and how this could have affected his future. There are many witnesses and the Prosecuter has much evidence against Steve. There are many people involved and much detail. It makes a really good play."
3,The Monster Review,"In this book the author used a screen play format. The novel is based on events in reality. Steve Harmon was sent to jail for murder. He was suppose to be a look out for his friends when they went and robbed the drug store. He didn't want to follow through with the plan but got caught in the mix. So now he is sent to jail scared and alone. Steve has been accused of murder. He sits in his sell and cries. Now he lives in fear, for his life. Just for being a face there it could cost a lifetime in jail."
2,Monster - dA book,"The book Monster is not a book like others.Its written like a film script in a view of a young Man.His name is Steve Harmon and he is the main character of the book.He is in a difficult situation, because he is in prison for felony murder.But nobody knows if its true, that he killed an old man in a drugstore and stole some things.There are other characters likle King and Bobo Evans, who are perhaps the murderer too.Many of you will ask1, why the book is called Monster.During the time in case, Steve is searching his own identity because many people are not believing in him, like the prosecutor.She called Steve a Monster because she is sure that Steve is guilty.The reason are that he is black, young and comes form the ghetto so he looks like a typical ghetto man.In my opinion , this book is only for persons who really enjoy reading.Children or teenager would have no fun reading this book, because there are a lot of difficult words and some parts are very boring !"
4,25 years to Life,"Monster was an intense book filled with excitement and thrill, I could not put it down. Steve Harmon's story is truly amazing and Walter Dean Myers has created a masterpiece to me. I truly felt like I was at this trial with Steve I could feel what he felt. Walter Dean Myers truly paints a picture. I recommend this book to someone who likes courtroom dramas. Something like a Law and Order show."
4,"Bookreview of the book ""Monster""","The book ""Monster"" written by Walter Dean Myers is about a boy, called Steve Harmon who is in prison because of murder.Steve Harmon is on trail because he and two other men (Mr. King and Mr. Evans) wanted to rob a store and the shopowner got shot in the felony. So the three men got in prison because of murder.I think that it is a good idea, from the author to write diaryentries and a filmscript, because in the script we see the objectiv facts and in the diary we see Steve Harmons feelings.I like the book very much, because it makes you think about yourself and the people around you person!"
3,Because I'm black ?,"Teh book ""Monster"" written by Walter Dean Myers is about an afro-american boy. Steve Harman is 16 years old and he is the main character of the book ""Monster"". Steve is on trail because of felony murder. Steve Harman, James King and Richer (Bobo) Evens are accused for a robbery and murder. The book is written like a movie script and a dairy of Steve. The author uses the camera positions and the dairy entry to feel and to get an impression of the whole situation.I think the book ""Monster"" is very intresting because this book shows the reality in streets and in judgement."
5,Awesome,"I thought that Monster was a awesome book. It was written in a screen play of a movie, that which made it a lot of fun to read. The book is based on 16 year old Steve Harmon, and his trial. Steve is on trial for robbery of a liquor store, and the murder of the store owner. Steve says that he was only the look out for the robbery, and that he never even entered the store during any time of the robbery. In the book the author describes Steves feeling gilety in the courtroom, and in jail. Cathy O Brian, Steves lawyer gives him usefull advice through out the entire book, that keeps him going and makes him never give up on his trial. In the end it turns out that Steve is prooven not guilty of the robbery and murder. I thought that this book was one of the best books I ever read.I recounmented this book to any one that likes drama, action (etc.).-Alxeandra Diaz"
5,HEY READ THIS BOOK IT'S AWESOME,"- Monster-The book ""Moster"" is about a boy named Steve. He tries to be friends with some guys that he thinks are really cool at school. It just happens that the guys that Steve wants to be friends with are in a gang. So to be in this gang you have to do something bad and get away with it. It's either cut someone or steal something. He and another guy chose to steal from a convenient store. While they are doing this the other guy shoots the cash register clerk. So then he is sent to jail when the police find him. He has to go through the trial. So you have to read it and see if he wins the case of not! This book is really good! IT KEPT MY ATTENTION THE WHOLE TIME; I COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPEND NEXT!!! It has exciting parts in the book all the way to the end. Read this book, you won't be sorry that you did!!!"
3,monster,The book is good if you like to fell like you are reading a movie but the way it is written it is a little hard not to get confused. The book has a good plot about murder so that keep you imbedded into the book. So if you like murder and do not get confused easy then pick the book.
4,Monster by Walter Dean Myers (Kris p.1),"Monster, Walter Dean Myers, was a very good book. It may have been a slight graphic and inappropriate for young children but i think this book allowed the teenage reader to connect. It allowed the reader to feel more wrapped up in the story. Steve Harmon and Walter Dean Myers used great imagery and detail to describe the events. The reader could feel themselve's in the scene. This book has a big impact on the reader. It makes them think about how bad life could be and helps them to appriciate their live, hopefully not in jail. Mrs. A i love you!"
5,This Book Rocks..........Great Insite!!!,"I totally respect Walter Dean Myers for making this book like a movie. It was a great book to relate to, because it was so real, it was like you could put yourself in the story. There were so many characters to like Bobo, King and probably, the most important character, Steve Harmon. Also, The way Walter Dean Myers put the setting in New York. Its a great city to write a crime story in. My favorite part was really the whole book! It had great insite. The diary entries gave the reader a great perspective of what was going through Steve's mind. This book is a very well written book. Was you begin reading you can't put the book down. Its just to good to let go. Go buy and read all you want."
4,Monster- by Z. Jaquandra Motisha,"This is a story about a young man named Steve Harmon who is sent to jail for a crime he didn't commit. This book is a twist between two different genres; screen play and novel- by the author using this technique, he gives the reader a different outlook of the story. Throughout the book, Steve thinks of everything that is important to him and he thinks about how he doesn't want people to consider him a monster. This is a quick read that will toss thoughts and scenerios through your head with every page."
4,Its Straight,This book is about a boy named Steve Harmon who is accused for helping people rob a drugstore. The book helps people to look inside the way jail really is and from his point of view. He ends up severing time and looking at life from a different persepective. It really helps us to see how it is to be in people's shoes who are in jail for something they did or something they didn't do.G.Zameria Motishia
4,Audio compliments the novel beautifully,"This resource is a wonderful tool, I purchased the audio to enhance the reading experience for my students. I wanted them to conduct a deep dive into this novel taking on the mindset of critical investigative readers."
5,The greatest book ever,This book captured my mind. Once I began to read the story I couln't stop reading the book. This book has everything a reader would like you to know about the story being told. We can see the different points of view from each character. The story seems so real because it displays some pictures and we see how steve seems to write down his day by day experience in jail. At the end of the book there is a lot of tension for King and for Steve...I am really amazed and surprised that this story is not based in a true story. I would really recommend teenagers that I know who want to change their lives read this book. This book really had a big impact on me.
5,Monster,I thought the book was great I just couldn't put it down and it was a true story I bought the book at a school book fair in it's hard-cover version and I read it in 2 1/2 days it was excellent.
4,Guilty or not?!?,"The book ""Monster"" is written by Walter Dean Myers and is about an african-american boy called Steve, woh is on trialHe is accused of murder and robbery but nobody knows if he is guilty or not.It maybe a think of moraly guilt. In the court it makes a big suspense, because there were no real witnesses, so it is testimony against testimony.Walter Dean Myers known from other famous books has with this book a new bestseller. He wrote this book in two different ways. On the one side you can read diary entries from Steve(his point of view) and on the other side it written like a filmskript. That makes the reader beeing both Jury and witness. It's not like other books. It has an open ending so it makes you thinking about the bokk an makey your an own opinion about Steve an the wohle trial."
3,Monster,"Steve is a black high shool student.He is only 16 years old.Steve is a very good student.According to one of his teachers he is a good young man that gets good grades in school.Steve lives in N.Y.C., but the book takes place in a New York Detention Center and in a Court room.Steave was involved in a robbery where a man was killed and now they want to blame him for the man's death.One reason why I like this book is beause it's really interesting and it's something that can happen to anybody.This book is well detailed because it describes what he was doing in jail and in the court room.The book describes the conflicts between him and other people in the Detention Center.This book is perfect for young people that live in the city because a lot of young people have gone or are going through this situation."
3,Not a monster,"In this book you get caught up in Steve Harmon's horror movie. A seventeen year old boy's acount of jail, trial, and their accompaning emotions. A good idea, but a little slow at times, definately worth the read!"
1,Guilty or innocent?,"The book ""Monster"" is written by Walter Dean Myers it is about the 16 years old Steve Harmon, who is on trial for robbery and murder.On trial Steve and Mrs O'Brien try to convince the juror that he is innocent. In my opinion this book is boring , because it has not suspense.The most part of the story takes place on trial. Ihave just read this book because we must readed at school for our Klausur. The reader does not get enough information about steves character.The diary from steve harmon is absurd because we does not get the information if he is guilty or innocent."
1,"WHo am I, a MONSTER?",A 16 years old black boy is in jail.His name is Steve King and he is accused for robbing a store.He was involved in a robbery.Now he in on trial.The jury has to decied if he is gilty or innocent...I find the book very boring.It makes you very confused if you read the book.You must be consantrated if you want to get the plot....
4,monster ms. scott pd8,"I thought this book was very interesting. This is not the like the usual books that I read. It was like watching a movie and reading a journal at the same time. It was also very easy to read. The book appears to be long, but the paragraphs are spaced out a lot. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to watch court movies."
4,Monster,"The book Monster by Walter Dean Myers is a thriller. The book suprised me in a lot of ways,that no other book has in a while. The reason I'm giving this book a excellent recommendation is that the book helps the reader understand court rules and regulations more fluently.I had alot of intrest in the book while reading it.The book catches your attention because it's a boy who's going through some serious changes during the course of the novel. Before you read the book Monster.Ask yourself,what is a monster?(In a figurative way)..."
5,Monster,"I have read many good books by Walter Dean Myers, but Monster by far is the best book I have read. After I read the first two sentences I had to keep on reading. The book is written in a play form. It's about a 16 year old black man named Steve who is accused of murder. He has to go on trial and while he is on trial he is in the process of writing a play. The end of the book will surprise you. You will have to read it to find out if he is guilty or not guilty. It's a shocker. I can guarantee you will like this book."
5,Packs a wallop,"This book is remarkably powerful. The style is incredibly unique, and I couldn't put it down - I read the book in one sitting. Never preachy or didactic, Myers is able to bring up the big life questions about truth and honesty, and about how making bad decisions can change your life forever.Fourteen year old Steve Harmon is in jail awaiting his murder trial. Written in a combination of journal and screen play, the reader is thrust into Steve's thoughts and fears as the events that led him to jail are slowly revealed.Because of the screen-play format, this is a fast read, but it packs a wallop."
4,Monster,"I have just finshed Monster, by Walter Dean myres. It is about this 16 year old blackboy named Steve. well, he goes into a drug store in Harlem (that is where he lives)and kills the owner,or did he? In the book it is just like you are in jail with him and are in the court roonm with them too. It is told in dialogue. You will love the book and will not beable to put it down if you enjoy shows like Law and order."
5,MONSTER,Monster was a very good book. It was so good it only took me two days to read it. The reason why I liked the book is because it seems so real. When I read the book the words were so clear. Most books that I read for school are boring and it takes me a long time to read them. It only took me two days to read Monster.
5,"My thoughts about the book ""Monster""","Monster was a very interesting book to me. Walter wrote the book as if it was a movie or play. I think it was ironic because that was my first time reading a book like that. Monster should be made into a movie because it will give you a more visual insight about the book. This is one of the books I read and wasn't too anxious to read the end of because I thought he, the main character, was going to go to jail. In all I liked the book a lot and wouldn't mind reading other books by Walter Dean Myers."
3,monster (laura),Monster is a book that I liked. It showed me what it was like to be in jail. When I was reading I was suddenly sucked in. It's also about a boy named Steve Harmon who is in jail for something he didn't do. It's also about a lady who calls all prisoners monsters.In jail Steve writes about the problems he has and what he has to go through everyday. So finally read this book...
3,Am I innocent because Ia not guilty,"The book ""Monster"" written by Walter Dean Myers is about the sixteen years old Steve Harmon who is on trial for murder. He is accused of being involved in a robbery in which a person has been killed. The prosecution who calls Steve monster says that he was the look out. But the question is: Does he really check the store? The author Myers has used two different types of represrentation, the film script and the diary entries. So the reader understand Steve especially his feelings as well as the jury. Myers tries to show the readers that the jurors had to pass a tough decision. And maybe they pass a wrong judgment. On the one hand was the book alittle bit boring because in the film script was no suspense but on the other hand I liked the diary entries so I got to know the character of Seve better. Iliked also that the reader think about the decision of the jurors and try to decide on their own about Steve's guilt or innocence."
2,Guilty or innocent,"The book Monster is about a boy named Steve Harmon who is accused of felony murder. The book is only about the trial. During this trial Steve wants to find out who he is. The biggest part of the book is written as a filmscript. The other part is written as diary entries.In my opinion this book is boring, because it is only about the trial and I don't like the filmscript because there are no emotions in it. I only like the diary entries because they are personal."
4,Bud country review,"the book ""Monster"" has very good format. It is in screenplay form. the book is easy to read because all the words are not jumbled and you do not have to worry about skipping over something. Walter Dean Myers has a great writing style i wish more books were written this way.The book portrays a boy named steve harmon. his life was put on hold when he was sent to jail for assiting in a robbery. as the trail went on steve wrote a screenplay about everything. he missed his family and his friends and his teacher. was steve in the wrong place at the wrong time or did he help out.i reccomend this book for everyone. take my advise and read this book."
5,MONSTER!!!!!,"The book Monster was an excellent book. Monster was about a young man named Steve that was sixteen and he was on trail for participating in a robbery where a man was murdered. Steve was the type of character that a lot of young man can related too. While Steve was on trail he wrote about he's days in jail. Doing the trail a lot of Steve friends was questioned and they lied and made things up to save themselves. By them lying they could have cause Steve to be sentence to the death penalty if he was found guilty. I really enjoyed this book, it had many lessons that everyone needs to learn. This book taught me that everyone you think is your friend is not, and it's up to you to find out who is before it's to late, and this book also made me feel right there in the courtroom watching Steve on trail."
3,"Walter Dean Myers, Monster Review","Monster was a very interesting book about the protagonist Steve Harmon who is accused of a crime he didn't do. This novel was written as if it were a script in a movie. This occasionally made this confusing at times. I would rate this book three stars. This is because this story mostly takes place in a court room, making the reading fairly dull. This book was suspenseful at times during the debate, but most of this book seemed to put my to sleep. One way I found this book original is that it was written so cleverly as a movie script. This gave this book a different feel. Steve's case is about a felony and murder that he was accused of. If he lost this debate he could even get the death penalty. This novel got its title from what the prosecutor, Mrs. Petrocelli, calls Steve, ""Monster."" I thought this book was very creative but lacked slightly in excitement. Overall this was a decent book that helped me understand the true fears of prison."
3,Monster Review,"I think that the book Monster had a very interestng point of view. It told the story of a trial in court through a movie script. THis point of view made the book many sided. I think that without this point of view, the book would have only shown the narrators point of view (main character) and therefore would not make a good story. Monster, used a lot of interesting detail to give clues about what was happening in the story! I think that Monster, by Walter Dean Myers, is a very well written book, with an interesting plot and storyline!"
1,Born To Kill,"The book ""Monster"" written by Wlater Dean Myers is about a sixteen years old Afro-American named Steve Harmon who is on trial because of felony murder. The book handles about a robbery which becomes an unplaned murder. 2 Guys want to rob a store and Steve is at the wrong time at the wrong place. The jury do not know if he is guilty or not.I like this book because it shows the reality and the main character is not like always these white breads."
1,Monster,Monster was not a good read. My daughter had to read it for school otherwise she would'nt have even finished it.
4,Monster,"The book ""Monster"" by Walter Dean Myers is an excellent book! I found the way the story was told in a movie script to be great. The story if about a teenager named Steve. Steve tells his story of his murder trial. I find the way that this movie is told as a movie script to be a great read. When I started reading this book I could not put it down. I think anyone who picks it up will enjoy reding monster"
2,Monster by Walter Dean Myers,"Monster is about an adolescent named Steve Harmon, who is on trial for murder. The main character is Steve Harmon, Briggs (lawyer), and Bobo (criminal). Steve got in trouble for being a look-out for some friends who committed a murder.I would recommend this book to a 13 teen year old because it was recommended to me. Also, when you are 13, you are bad and misbehave. Maybe this book will straighten you out."
4,Interesting,"I must admit, if I were choosing a book to read on my own it would not have been this one. It just seems depressing from the name and the cover; however, ""You can't judge a book by it's cover."" I read this book for a college course in library science. The film script style kept me interesed. The setting and plot were very realistic. This book would be helpful for some teens. I will definitely include it in my library."
3,Monster,"I read the book Monster. It''s about a 14 year old kid named Steve Harmon who is accused of attempted robbery. What really was supposed to happen was that Steve was to give the OK sign to Osvaldo Cruz and James King, and they were to go into the store and rob the owner. What they didn't know was that the owner, Mr. Nesbitt, had a shotgun to defend him and his store. James went for the gun to take it away from him and the gun went off and killed the Mr. Nesbitt. So now Steve Harmon, Osvaldo Cruz, and James King are in court to find if they're guilty or not. You'll have to read the book to find out what happens to them. I didn't really like the book because it was written like a movie script. I recommend this book to 9th graders and up because the author writes about how this kids life is turned around forever."
4,Monster,I liked the book a lot. I like it so much that I want it to be a Monster II. I gave this book 4 stars because it was good but I didn't like the ending.
5,monster,i think the book is cool i like the exspense in this exciting thriller about a 16 year old boy on trial for murder.i rated this book 5 stars because it was one of the most exciting books i have ever read
4,A Meaningful and powerful read,"Steve Harmon. A kid of only sixteen years old, only two years older than me. Already his life seems already gone. He is in jail and on trial for murder, if he gets scentenced he will stay a lifetime in jail (20 years). This book makes you thankful. It opens your eyes to a situation that is so real that you feel yourself hurt by every fear Steve feels. ""They didn't allow kids in the visiting area, which was funny. It was funny because if I wasn't locked up, I wouldn't be allowed to come into the visiting room."" pg.156."
5,Really Good Book!,"The book ""Monster,"" by Walter Dean Mayers,is very interesting. I felt like i was right there hearing the trial with my own ears. I think that this is a great book for young adults to read. It sends the message that we shuold be careful where we go and not to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Steve was in the wrong place at the wrong time and now if he gets convicted he will be facing a minuim of 25 years in prison. also this novel teaches young people to be careful who you trust. This novel is one of the best that I have ever read. If u want to read an exciting and suspenseful book then you should read Monster."
4,mioski's review,"The book monster is a novel written in the form of a play. This makes the book very easy to read. It also makes it more interesting to read, because it is written different than other novels.The author of the book does a very good job at describing the setting of the story. He also uses descriptive words to make the novel more interesting.The plot of this book makes you want to keep reading it. I think that the author did an excellent job of writing this book."
4,Monster Critique,The book Monster is about a 16 year old man names Steve Harmon. Steve is on trial for being involved in a local New York small store hold up that ended in a death. He is writing his experiences in a journal that he will later turn into a movie. The whole book is written as if there were several different scenes. The story is a fast reader but still keeps you interested though all of it. The characters are well thought out by the author and you can really tell who is educated and what part of the city they are from. The book also starts out a bit fast but as you read you become fascinated in the plot line. You don't start out knowing everything that you want to but that is what makes the book suspenseful.
3,Review of Monster by Sam,"I thought this book was ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. I really dislike how the author would change from scenes in the courtroom and flashback to Steve's childhood. It made things confusing and I would often have to read things over again. I also disliked the cameras. The way a camera would zoom in and pick up various activities also took up time and made the book seem as though it took forever to read. I understand that for the plot of the book the style was almost neccessary. If you're into this type of writing I'm sure you will like it but it's not my preference. But in contrast, the author did a nice job of matching personalities to the characters. He even got the street slang down pretty well, making the characters believable."
5,monster,"In the beggning a kid named Steve Harmon was in a drug store. While he was in the store a robbery took place and the shop owner got shot by a man named King. Eventually he died and the courts charged Steve and King for the murder. The book is basically about Steve, the main character and his trial. I'm not going to tell the end but it is kind of a mystery. Was he in the crime or was he not in the crime. This book is a definite 5 in my place. I feel that its a perfect examle of teenagers in the ghetto and in jail. I would really recommend reading this book."
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read,"I like the book because it has a lot of feeling to it. And I like it because it is real. I like the characters Steve, James, the prosecutor, and the Mexican Diablos. The Diablos are throwed. I would recommend this book to boys who think they are thugs.Dobie Middle School in Austin, Texas is number 1!"
4,Director,From the title readers are trying to understand why the main character is being called a monster. As the book progresses readers find out the events that led to him being behind bars. He tells his story like a movie to cope with being in such a negative place. His movie includes the court visits to the daily angst from being locked up and his concern with his future. He does return to life beyond bars. This book was an interesting look life behind bars and the consequences of a situation that seemed innocent at the time that turned bad. I would use this book for a middle school grade and have a unit on everything involved in the book.
5,I loved this book I recommend this book to anyone my own age,I loved this book Monster by Walter Dean Myers. It always had me at the edge of my seat wondereing what was going to happen next. I highly recommend this book to anyone on the high school reading level
5,Much better than I thought.,"Even though I didn't want to read yet another book about ayoung African American male in trouble with the law, I found thisstory compelling and difficult to put down. I read it quickly and wanted to discuss it with others who had read it. If I could, I would teach this novel for the purposes of not only talking about peer pressure and crime, but to explore the criminal justice system and how it impacts young African American males. This book shares similarities with other good works on the same topic: they include Sanyika Shakur's Monster: The Autobiography of an L.A. Gang Member, Nathan McCall's Makes Me Wanna Holler, and Joseph Marshall's Street Soldier. All of them deal with the plight of young African males growing up in the inner city."
5,Gripping Book One of Myers Best Books!,"After reading about Steve Harmon, I could not get him out of my mind. I was moved by this book, because it seemed as though you are going through the arrest and the anticipation of awaiting the verdit. It was hard for me to put the book down. But once you read this snapshot of Steve Harmon's ordeal, you'll be confused, angry, happy and sad all at once. I applaud Mr. Myers on a job well done."
4,Monsta!,Monster makes great use of the play format. The novel puts you right at the center of action and takes you to a world of criminality where you can visualize exactly what happened.
3,Why monster is a so-so book.,"16-year-old Steve Harmon is blamed of serving as a lookout for a robbery of a Harlem drugstore. The owner was shot and killed, and now Steve is in prison going through his trial because the part he had just for being a look out. Steve then says what happen and what role he took in the murder. Also Myers writes about the character feelings and how hard it was for him. That is why the book monster got good reviews."
4,Scooby-Goo,I think the book monster is a good book because that book is exiciting and it has alot of details and it has alot of suspence. The part I like the most was when he was found innocent because all he went through and they all did to him it was all a waste of time.The part I didn't like when the cops didn't do anything about it they just look but didn't get no evidence that he was innocent. They didn't even found fingerprints because they said they couldn't touch anything.But then I like when he was found innocent because all his records and bad things they said about him was all a lie and he did time for nothing.I think that in the real world there are more innocent people in jail then guilty people that's why I like this book
3,Monster,the book is good because it kept my attention but it was boring in the respect that the book wasn't original because one of the other books ive read was about almost the same thing a guy who says he is inosent and he knows people that are in gangs and the people that had no choice but to do what the gang members said the book sais when you are in a gang you are given a task that you need to get in a fight with someone and make your mark on thier face(cut a deep wound in thier face in order to make a scar). After the trials they started to bring in whitnesses to either prove them guilty or prove them inocent. If Steve Harmon is proven guilty he will get 25 or 23 yrs. to life.
3,the chedder review,this book was pretty good thats why i rated it a 3. i was reding it with my partner it was really interesting how everything went down a day it turns out that steve was not the one who killed the clerk. but the guy who had the ciggarettes and gave it to his mom for chrismas. i could tell the whole story but i dont want to why just read for ur self and read what happens to steve harmon
4,Jake's Review,I liked the book because I like books that are almost always exciting. I also like it because you never know how it will turn out in the end. This book is cool because it's something that could happen in real life and because its about court and I like to watch court shows on tv .The story Monster is about a 16-year-old kid named Steve. Steve is accused of robbery of a drugstore and murder. He gets arrested and goes to trial. Steve cannot believe this is happening to him and try's to pretend he's watching a movie and it's happening to someone else.A reader that likes a book with suspense would like this book because you never know what will happen. You would also like this book if you watch cop or court show's on tv. One other person to like this book would be a Realistic fiction reader.
3,Review of the book MONSTER,"It's about a boy Steve Harmon who is unguilty on trial.The book is in some places objectiv and in some places subjectiv.Steve describes in his diary his feelings and thinks. Steve is a good afro-american student and he has a special liking for film-making so is the book made as a script.It's easy to read. It isn't the most interesting book in the world but I recommend it for teenagers. The reader would find this book in some places interesting, emotionally and suspenselly if he is interested in the destiny of afro-american kids who live in poor area."
3,"Osvaldo Gonzalez, Scotts 4","When I first started reading the book i thought it wasnt going to be interesting for me. Since it was written like a movie script or play i got confused at first. I then got used to it and thought it was easer and more interesting to read.I really think this book is good.The main character Steve was at the wrong place at the wrong time when he was accused of something he didnt do, and that was murder.Now everybody thinks hes a MONSTER what can he do or what will he do to prove he isnt the murder.See for yourself and read the book.I recomended to the young adults out there."
5,Monster by: Shevell Taylor,"Monster was a great book it had a lot of suspense and action. The story started when Hermon in his cell at the juvenile detention center of Manthatton and he is describing how the place is When it's dark and when it's light. The story is written like a movie so theres going to be things like ""cut to, Fade in, Fade out, and etc...."". Hermon is the narrarator of the story so your going to get a better feeling of how he feel and what is going on frim his point of view. The story will be talking about how Hermon is on trail for murder and how his whole life change by one bad choice he made."
4,A must read for Middle School Students,"I just got done reading this book. As a Middle School Librarian, I must say I was impressed. It would definately attract the attention of young readers from many backrounds. In fact, I'm going to recommend this book for our next book club meeting."
5,Great book!,"I know I gave this book 4 stars but I really did enjoy it and I finished it quickly! The main character, Steve Harmon is in a court trial and I like the way that Meyers wrote and described the court room!In the story Steve Harmon deals with so much stuff including jail time and having to go to the court room a lot. Steve Harmon was somehow involved with a murder case so now he is on trial for assisting the murder. Nobody really knows if he is inisant or not so you have ot read the book to find out.The book is short but it really does show you how stressful it is to be on trial. I loved this book and I think all teenagers older than about 15 should read this book!I hope my review was helpful!"

2,Monster,"...I didn't really like this book. One of the main reasons was probably because it was like in a movie text. I didn't really understand it. Two main reasons that I started reading this book is because of the cover of the book and it had finger prints on it and that reminds me of criminals. I love reading books about criminals. And I guess u already know this is about criminals well sort of. Because Steve was getting some stuff in a food store and his friends said they would buy it for them so when they came out they said they paid for and they really didn't so he got put in jail for it. So he writes what happens in the form of a movie. So if you like criminal books, and like it in movie text, you will like this book."
3,Book Review,"Monster is mainly about a 16 year old boy named Steve. Steve is a very timid kid fighting for his innocence. This book takes place in a Manhattan Detention Center. Steves problem is that he is being falsely accused for commiting murder. Now he has to go on trial and see what happends.This book ""Monster"" is basically all dialogue and no actions. There are alot of characters in this book and it is hard to keep track of them since it's written like a movie. This book has alot of realism since it was based on a true story. There really isnt alot of suspense in this novel. ""Monster"" drags out alot and i wouldnt recommend this book to anyone.To the peron who wrote this book, I think he should have sold this ""script"" to a movie maker. This book was a waste of time to read. Thank You."
2,Boring,"Steve Harmon, a 16 year old black bale from Harlem, is on trial for a crime he says he didn't do. He writes a notebook to make a movie from. This is what you're reading. He wrote the book in prison.Boring!! This is not the slowest book, but not the most intersting on either. The movie-like writing makes it easy to read, but it really has no high point. The ending is predictable and no big surprise.Kyle"
5,Kevin B.,"I would recommend to either a guy or a girl, i think they would both find it interesting. I would also recommend this to a person who likes mysterious types of books because Steven Harmon a sixteen year old boy is caught in a problem with the police. They have accused him of being a lookout or a store robbery in which a man was killed. I would also recommend this to anyone who likes Non-fiction books because it's based on a true story. Steve Harmon was a real guy and the robbery really did happen. I would also recommend this to anyone who likes intensity types of books, at the end when they are waiting for the jury's decision it was intense to see if he was innocent or guilty."
4,THE MONSTER I SEE,I REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK. IT WAS VERY INTERESETING AND SAD. I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY RELATES TO THE LIFE WE ARE LIVING NOW. IT SHOWS US SOMETIMES HOW LIFE CAN BE FAIR AND ALSO BE UNFAIR. SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE BLAMED FOR SOMETHING FOR BEING IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. IT TEACHES US THAT YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL WITH WHAT TYPE OF PEOPLE YOU ARE DEALING WITH AND WHEN AND WHERE YOU ARE. I LIKE THE BOOK BECASUE IT SHOWS THAT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ONE PERSON ACCUSING YOU OF SOMETHING THATS HOW YOU WILL BE JUDGED BY MANY OTHERS EVEN IF YOU PROOVE THEM WRONG. LIFE IS UNFAIR LIKE THAT AND YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THE BAD THINGS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW YOU WILL NOT DO ANYTHING BAD. ONE THING WILL LEAD TO OTHER THINGS.
4,An Interesting Book To Read,"Monster is an exceptional book, in my opinion, that cannot be written in a better way. Steve Harmon, the protagonist, tells his views on what happenend during his time in jail and in the courtroom. He views back his life as he is being accused out in a robbery. The dialogue is written like a film script which tells this unique story with a vividly image."
4,Monster By Walter Dean Myers Review By The ShNaMasta,"Monster is about a 16 year old boy named Steve Harmon. He is accused of assiting in a murder by being a lookout, while a criminal shoots a convienence store owner. The story is conveyed by Steve in a movie script he creates based on his jail and court experieces. He also shows his emotions through his journal which he writes in while he is locked up.This book is good for the ages of maybe 12 to 16. This is because it shows a kid in adult situations which may relate to many teens. At first, the author's way of sending out the story is confusing, but then it becomes more natural. Monster is not a very long book but its theme is fantastic. Big things come in small packages."
3,Poor Kid,"It was interesting to read a book in the view of a ""ghetto"" kid accused of a crime and I liked how several characters became intertwined in a chain of events throughout the clarification of the story. However, the defendant progressed through the entire book without ever gaining a chance to defend himself, and explain the truth. Maybe the author tried to show the actual injustice faced in life today, but it really frustrated me to an extent that the book left me feeling irritated and unsettled!"
5,WOW! one of the best books i ever read,This book was a great book. I was so into it that i read it in 1 day! It was so realastic and you could feel what the kid was going through! You should deffenitely get it.
2,Monster,Steve Harmon is a sixteen year old black teen on trial for murder in the state of New York. Steve is supposedly an accopmplice in the murder of a store owner. but as the story unfold Stev seems to be less and less involved in the murder. as the book goes on the trial is much too mild mannerd to be a beiveable trial for murder. also the small amonts of time devoted to describing steves life in prison represented in thhis story are hard to believe and border on being stupid. but overall Monster by Walter Dean Myers ia an average read for teens.
2,Review of Monster,"The subject matter of the novel Monster was very unique. I have never read a book that dealt with such deep subject matter. I did not really like the book because it was very difficult to read. I think that I did not enjoy reading the book because it was written in the form of a screenplay, and it was harder for me to follow the story. I think that young readers can relate to the things that the main character went through, but, personally, I did not like the book. It was hard to read, and the subject matter was disturbing."
5,A heart warming tale of a boy in prison.,Monster is a great book involving a young boy and his emotions in jail and during his trial. The book is told in a script format and it is a very quick read. The script format allows the reader to get a very good mental picture of the surroundings and settings of the story. Hand-written journal entries are thrown in from time to time and shows how the main character is thinking and feeling. The flashbacks in the story give the reader details leading up to the trial and to him being put into jail.T.J. M.
4,Well written YA novel,"Monster is a strongly written novel with an even stronger theme. The few characters that are deeply developed, although most are not developed at all, are really able to connect with the reader, and get inside their head. The pacing is very easy to follow with it being very fast paced in most places, although some parts are rather tedious, especially the lawyers' closing arguments. The plot and point-of-view can be a little confusing, because the novel switches from third to first person often, but the important plot points are clear. The setting is shown in a rather unusual way, and it can sometimes be unclear as to where you are, but the movie script does provide an interesting read."
4,Fast Read and a very good book!!,"This was a very well put together book! This book has this certain type of edge that will make you never want to put it down. I loved the layout this book was in. It made it seem like the book flew by. This story is basically about a guy who tells his story about what it's like in prison, and what he has to go thorugh. The way this book was set up, it made it a very fast and easy read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fast read books."
4,"Monster, a book for everyone","Monster is a book about a boy who is convicted of a crime. The boy believes and tries to convince everyone that he is innocent, but even his lawyer is in doubt. Walter Dean Myers leaves the reader to decide whether the boy is innocent or not. Steve, the boy convicted of murder, has the hobby of writing movie scripts, and there isnt a better movie to write than his own sad life, but yet exciting and suspenseful life. The reader is learning about his life similar to the way the watchers of his movies would be. This book is recommended to anyone who enjoys reading at all and esspecially those who need a break because this book is easy and fun to read."
4,Choices,Monster is a book that shows you that if you make the wrong choices or hang out with the wrong people only bad things will come. In 16 year old Steven Harmon&#65533;s case it means possibly spending the rest of his life behind bars for something that he might have not even have done. You really get into this book and you&#65533;re actually hoping that Steven will get out of it somehow. The book Monster shows you not to make bad decisions.
3,Fast Read,"""Monster"" follows the story of a 16 year old boy, Steve, through his trial for murder. The book is written like a movie script which may be confusing for some readers. The reader enjoys the suspense and anticipation throughout the trial as the book pulls in past information from Steve's life. The author only lets the reader get to know Steve and all other characters are stereotypes of the average gang member or lawyer. The story was a quick read and kept my attention but was weak with personalizing the characters, being desrciptive of the scenes, and was unclear on some parts througout the story."
3,Monster: Innovative but Unsatisfying,"Monster is an innovative, gritty, and ultimately unsatisfying book about a 16-year-old's murder trial. The format is attention-getting; it combines journal entries and a script penned by the 16-year-old protagonist. However, the format also guarantees that the boy's character and the world around him remain sketchy. All the reader knows of Steve Harmon is what Steve Harmon reveals, and that isn't much. The neighborhood where he grew up is vaguely depicted, the parents are well-meaning but generic, and Harmon himself is inscrutable. Some might find this intriguing; I found it incomplete. Readers weaned on cop shows will find the sets & secondary characters familiar -- the lawyers, judge and fellow inmates come right out of Law and Order. In general, the book is a fine idea but is disappointingly insubstantial and cliched."
3,Unique Dialogue,"Monster is a book about a man getting thrown in jail. I didn't really understand how to read the book because it switches through different scenes so quickly that it just got me confused. But, what I think I understand was, it's a story about a black male that gets placed in jail for a robbery crime that he didn't do.The reason I gave this book 3 stars was because the dialogue was just a little above my level. I couldn't understand many things that the author was trying to say. Maybe when I grow older and get a bigger education, i'll buy this book and be able to read it the way its supposed to be read."
4,Monster: Guilty or Innocent,"""Monster"" is a great story about, Steve, a 16 year old man who is being tried for the robbery and killing of a local drugstore owner. In this book written by Walter Dean Myers the story is told as a script for Steve's movie and a journal. By letting the reader in to both, we are positioned as a witness and part of the jury. The detail in which Myers goes into keeps the reader enthralled into the pages of the book and makes every thing sound very real. In all ""Monster"" was an excellent book that almost all can read."
2,Sadly disappointing,"I was left terribly unsatisfied by this novel. It's won a handful of awards, so I was expecting to be wowed. But I felt very lukewarm toward the storyline throughout the entire book. I just didn't *care* about any of it. I was *really* intrigued by the story being told in the form of a movie, but I ended up not liking it.Not something I'd recommend to anyone. :("
4,Monster,"Granted I read this back in high school, but I loved it. It was so interesting to me; someone who has not experience much at all myself or really doesn't even know much beyond my small town life. This book showed me what life could have been and is for kids my age. I would recoommand this book to everyone it is really eye opening, it is a little scary but life is scary."
3,In a cell with a guilty concious by Alberto A.,Reading this book was an assignment given to us by our teacher. We would read and then write a one page summary based on what we read. This book is about a sixteen year old Steve Harmon who is accused of murder because he was present at the crime scene. In jail a lady called the prisoners monsters. With the journal the prison supplied for the prisoners Steve wrote about the troubles and hardships he faced in jail. The title of his play formed journal was Monster. So with Steves world spinning and him having to sit in court and sleep in jail this book is a rollercoaster it has its ups and downs. So if you are interested read and find out more about the monsters in jail...And finally put yourself in Steve's shoes what would you do if you had to stay in jail for something you didn't do.
4,Monster,"Steve is a young 16 year old man that is said to be a Monster. He is said to be a Monster because he is accused of being involved in robbery and maybe even guilty of killing a man. This is a very exciting and thrilling book about a young man who could get sentenced to death or life in prison.Once you start reading the book, you start getting more and more excited. Throughout the whole story, you have to ask yourself, is Steve guilty? You also see people around him start to act different because they aren't even sure if Steve is innocent.If you are looking for a book that will keep you guessing and will keep you excited then this is the right book for you. This is just flat out one of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to find out what Monster is all about, see for yourself, if Steve is a Monster or not."
2,"Monster is scary, not in a great way","I found that the story was too fast paced for something as dramatic as a 16 year old boy on trial for murder. The settings changed too quickly at the beginning, and I found the plot kind of confusing. The plot though, was believable and realistic, and there was very little profanity, if any. The language was not coated with heavy accents, the closest it got was gangsta talk. The point of view was from Steve Harmon, and there was a fair share of the plot jumping around. The characters were very real, and you could really picture it in your mind. Sadly, I could not say this for much of this book.I would really recamend reading Eragon, and the Harry Potter series."
3,Got what we paid for,"The book arrived quickly but when it said used, it meant ""Very Used""I should have spent a few dollars more for the new one."
4,Monster by David N.,"Imagine for a second that you have been accused of murder and you are rushed are jail for a crime you did'nt even do. Well that what happens to Steve Harmon in Walter Dean Myers book MONSTER.In Steve's jail going journey, Steve incounters many different people such as his laywer Kathy O'Brien, the gangstar wannabe Osvaldo Cruz, and the ruthless killer James King.So why was he convicted you might ask? On the night of December 22nd Mr.Nesbit was found dead in a local quick shop. Steve Harmon was the supposed look-out for James King and Richard ""Bobo"" Evans. But all Steve did was get some mints.A section of the book say ""The best time to cry is at night, when the lights are out and someone is being beaten up and screaming for help.""So if you want a book that has real-life story with good heart,read MONSTER."
5,R.H.Kirk,For all of you Cab & Kirk fans : THIS IS RICHARD H. KIRK. It is also some of the darkest funk this genius has ever sculpted.Buy it... and then buy new Electronic Eye
3,Durable but strap is not comfortable,"I love athletic no nonsense watches and have owned many over the years. This watch is great, but the strap is a weird concave shape that winds up ""spinning"" on my wrist or causing dents if tightened more. The band also makes my wrist perspire because it's not sitting properly and comfortable. I want a watch I don't have to think about during sports like cycling and surfing, so this one is not really up to scratch, but for the price, I'm not too fussed about it, just letting others know."
4,Great watch,"After using it for awhile my GF has noticed the face is loose but also said that the previous model of this version had that same issue. Other than that, solid buy and (cute) watch in our opinions."
3,Not as advertised by Amazon,"This watch is listed as a ""Flix"", but it is not a flix. Other than its not beng as advertised, it is a decent watch."
4,Trusty watch,"Great watch. Tried and true this watch has lasted throught the years. However, the little round band that holds the strap down breaks a lot. I am on my third one."
4,Much better...,"Much better than the previous digital watches I have purchased. I am NOT a runner or athlete who is concerned with the time. I do like to be able to SEE the time, and this watch has a small size with larger than expected digits, making it easy to view. Great price, easy to program watch."
3,Where's the chron feature?,"I loved my first two Timex Ironman watches and wore them completely out over the years. The chronological feature was easy to use but I have yet to figure out how to, or if it even has, the chronological feature on the Timex Ironman Triathlon. :-("
2,Ladies Timex Sport Watch,"A real disappointment. Not as pictured or described, however, Amazon was first rate regarding my return. Thanks Amazon - that's why I keep coming back."
3,Wasn't what I wanted,I am really disappointed. I thought this watch would track my distance. It doesn't. So upset. 50 gone. Why is this even categorize as a pedometer?
1,Watch doesn't function at all,"Too bad, the watch looks nice. Either the battery is expired or the watch is broken. It won't function at all. I wasted my money."
4,Timex Women's Watch,"I've purchased this watch before and it's been great! However, the last version of the watch's screen broke after only 4 months of use. I'm returning the watch..."
2,Great watch -- but light went out fast,"Love the watch. Good price, like the little bit of color without being too much, or too girly.But... about a week after the return window closed, the light stopped working.Timex's warranty still covers it, but requires shipping it to Timex and paying $8. So, pretty much half the cost of the watch.Bummer."
3,pros and cons,This is a nice watch. Has all the features that I need. HOWEVER..... the color on the face definitely fades over time so you have a monochromatic grey rather than the light blue. ALSO the watch band falls apart long before the watch does. At present I have the watch band held together with electrical tape and staples. I am sure timex figures that most folks will just buy a new watch- but I am cheap and stubborn. I must admit that I have not contacted timex to inquire about a new watch band but off hand it does not appear to be easily replaced. If the watch band lasted as long as the watch I would be thrilled.
4,"has timer, but not intervals","I bought this watch based on a previous review that said it comes with interval timers. It doesn't. It does have a timer that you can set so it repeats once it reaches zero. I wanted a watch that you can set to time run/walk intervals - on those you set interval 1 and interval 2 and you can set it so it repeats the intervals until you stop it.This watch does have the chrono feature (but I think pretty much all sports watch have that), the timer, 3 alarms and something called ""occasion."" Looks nice, as pictured.If you're a runner and you're just interested in your split times, this will work. If you do the run/walk thing, or you want to do timed sprints with a timed recovery in between w/o constantly checking your watch, this isn't the watch you want.This is the only watch I've found so far that does intervals:Timex Women's T5K007 Ironman Sleek 50-Lap Resin Strap Watch"
4,Great Watch at a Great Price,I confess that I am a straight up fan of Timex watches. I have had several over the years (many). I had a Triathlon when I used to dive and I had that watch for years. So far what I like about this watch is the band and the size of the face. As my reading eyesight is getting worse I wanted a bigger watch face and this one is easy to read and yet not so big you look like your wearing a man's watch. This is a great watch with some excellent features. Love it and would definitely recommend.
4,Great Watch,"I've had this watch for about a month now, and several trips to the pool later, there have been no condensation issues, so that's a big plus. The face is a little larger than other sport watches I have owned, but it's not overly huge. I love that the time is much easier to set/change than previous Timex watches I have owned (didn't even have to read the directions this time :) ). The color is great and the large numbers on the display are nice. If you work in or around water and are likely to be wet or sweaty all day, the resin band is absolutely the way to go; I'll never work in a cloth, velcro, or leather band. So far I am very happy with it."
5,Pink & Gray,This is a great watch. I Love the color. I think for the price Timex is a great brand. It is easy to set and works good.
5,Workout Watch,I needed a watch to workout in since I only have dress watches and so far I am happy with it especially being able to set different alarms.
4,watch,"The watch is great and perfect for a teen who can't take care of anything. it's bascically indestructable and easy to operate. However, based on the picture, I thought I was getting a teal watch band with a gray accent. It turned out to be gray watch band with purple accent."
4,Nice Watch,I really like the watch. Good seller. Arrived timely manner. The color of the band was a little more purple that I thought from the picture. I still like it and would certainly recommend this seller.
2,"Lasted less than a year, not waterproof","I had one of these before and it worked great for many years. Got a new one, but after swimming in the ocean for an hour, the display went blank. I wasn't sure if it was a battery problem or if water had gotten into it, but either way I had worn the watch for less than a year. I am sure that i didnt bang the watch too. I took it off to deal with later. The next day, the display was filled with black inky liquid. The warranty was worthless since this was categorized as a ""display problem."". Needless to say I am very disappointed in the lack of quality and recourse."
4,Good watch good price,I checked out a lot of watches and I like this one. It has a number of features and options yet the face of the watch is not cluttered and is easy to read. Best of all it is easy to set up and use the options. And I like the color & so does my husband.
1,Sunscreen melts the crystal!,"This watch is waterproof, so my daughter wore it to the beach, pool etc. She did love this watch, but ruined the crystal when she sprayed herself with sunscreen. Voided the warranty, and this is not listed in the pamphlet. What a disappointment."
4,Timex Unisex Ironman #T5K018,"I bought this watch to help me train for my first half-marathon. Has all the standard features we're used to with digital watches, time, date, chrono w/split times, etc. You can also program occasions like birthdays, meetings, and anniversaries so you don't forget to stop and buy flowers during your run. The feature I use the most on this watch is the countdown timer. BEWARE!! I'm about 5'10"" and 160lbs and have small wrists which prompted me to go for the unisex model; however, the watch case is more a ladies or teen size. I only wear it for running so it doesn't bother me too much, but my buddies would have a good time of it if I wore this out to the bar."
3,Purchased specifically for interval timer.,"I'm 42 and haven't worn a watch in a very long time. This was purchased specifically for it's timer/interval timer function which I use for timing meditation/Reiki treatments. I have the timer pre-set for 20 minutes to meditate, then once the alarm goes off, I switch over to the Interval Timer which is set up (both intervals) for 2 minutes so it simply chimes every 2 minutes until I turn it off. I think the alarm/timer chime is delicate enough to be used for meditation (Compared to other products like kitchen timers.) and so it is serving my intended purpose quite nicely.As a watch? Eh. I think it's bulky and uncomfortable to wear on my wrist. As an alarm clock, the alarm isn't very loud or aggressive (which is why I like to use it for meditation) but when I've slept with the watch on my wrist and my arm is under the pillow, I don't hear the alarm."
2,Paint Chips Off,I initially liked this watch. However after several months the pink coloring on the bezel started chipping off. A year later and its more chipped off areas than pink areas and it looks terrible.I also developed contact dermatitis from the rubber band. Careful if you have latex/rubber allergies.
4,Good watch for working out,I bought this for the wife and she likes it. She walks and swims laps and like the lap feature. It looks pretty good too.
4,Not as described,"The Timex watch has some great features. I was excited about trying out the FLIX system. The product arrived and did not have any documentation on it that it had a FLIX system. I expect the watch to outlast the wrist band, which with normal use has lasted about two years on the other two timex watches that I have purchased over the years. It is a good watch with useful features. Just don't expect the FLIX system on this product."
2,Not for the tender hearted!!!,"I've used an electric 'foil-type' shaver for the last 15 yrs and decided to try the rotary type. Well, they should have called this the 'pull and tear"" instead of the 'lift and cut'. I've been using this shaver for about a month now and I wince everytime I use it. I have a light beard so i figured it would cut easily. To my surprise, it is quite painful to get used to this type of shaver. if you can handle the pain, it does cut extremely close. My reason for the 2 star rating. Other than that i would not recommend this type over a good foil electric shaver."
3,Cannot Summarize and Print ONLY PAGES WITH COMMENTS!,"Aside from being great for making PDF files and the usual stuff I just found this one major problem.If you try to summarize comments and print them (or save as a separate file) you get every page ""even if it doesn't have a comment on it""!I just found this little snafu after printing out 240 pages when I only needed the 5 pages that actually had comments!I only want to print JUST THE PAGES THAT HAVE COMMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. I don't need a page after every page that has no comments that says ""This page has no comments""! DUH!What a waste of my time and paper!Why the heck did Adobe change this from version 6 to 7??"
2,"Very mixed feelings...,","I use PDFs a lot and I must say that quite often I turn to Free PDF software to actually do the tasks that Acrobat fails to do. One area I have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes Acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so I switch to the Free PDF software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use.However if you are a pro PDF maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then I recommend this product hands down as the best one. I just find that it is not always the best PDF software package in the world, but a good one all the same.I would not recommend buying this one just to make standard PDF files alone. If you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right."
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I assumed, incorrectly, that Adobe's customer service would be professional and quick. I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone.When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!! Adobe's call center is easily the worst customer service I have dealt with -- and I've dealt with some bad customer service."
3,Doesn't hold up to it's promise,"This is the granddaddy of all those doorstoppers that review 1000s of obscure films. And one has to be grateful that Weldon was able to draw some attention to obscure classics. This book was published in 1982 and there was nothing like this around. But unlike Hardy's (Aurum) Overlook Enc. of Horror Films, where the author's actually have seen all the films, Weldon here far too often puts together all of the propaganda material he obviously possessed without having seen the movie. So the book reads more like a collection of flyers and is not a help for anyone that wants to check out if the film is worth the effort. Now-nearly 20 years later, a lot of those rare gems are available through specialised distributors and it's Weldon's Book that started it all. But I would not recommend it - now, there are better books out there."
5,"George Benson's ""Tenderly""","George's Romantic voice and the tastily produced accompaniment, for example--piano, guitar, strings--,afford the listener a pleasurable offering of beautiful standards. His renditions cause you to want to replay the CD many times. If you like this, you may also like ""Tenderly"" by Rosemary Neilson.Tenderly"
3,"Good price, haven't needed.","Purchased to take on a cruise, never needed so never took it, so can't say if it works or not. Good price, fast shipping."
3,Stick Out Your Tongue,"The stories are rich in tastes of the rawness of a world very foreign to ours. My difficulty with this book is the strong undercurrent of incest. One or two stories with this theme would have been plenty to make the point, even if incest is that predominent there."
5,Good Book,Book was in perfect shape. Pretty easy read and touched on many points that are discussed in my graduate program. Thanks!!
2,Good not great,"As much as I love Ralph Feinnes, Toby Stephens and Liv Tyler in other films, this work was not at all satisfying. It started out strong enough but somewhere in the middle, it simply fell apart. Maybe it was the editing... but I never felt that Onegin (Feinnes) was as violently in-love with Liv Tyler's character until the very end. The last half hour needed more meat. It was too rushed to be able to appreciate any of the unrequited love. Rent it-- don't buy it."
5,I would worship at The Temple of Ralph Fiennes,"Yes, yes...amazing. Anything which would feature Ralph Fiennes overacting and making such faces...at the skating rink, the dual, the dance and in the carriage. Let's give Martha only projects which feature her eldest bro giving it his all."
4,Watch it,"I just finished watching the movie and am very delighted. If you have any appreciation for art, you will appreciate this movie. The cinematography itself is a poem. It tells the complex love story without redundance, and elegantly. Casting and acting are all well done. This movie certainly worth your time. The only reason why I am not giving this movie 5 star is because it is based on a book and no movie beats your imagination."
2,Boring,"I watched this movie expecting a great passionate love story between two star crossed lovers, based on reviews and the back of the movie. Instead I got 1:45 minutes of very little diologue and meaningful expressions. There was little explanation for why Tatyana and Onegen fell in love, adn there wasn't enough chemestry for it to have been love at first sight. Rather then feeling that Onegen was some kind of tormented hero upon his return to Tatyana I almost felt like he was a preying other man, who saw his chance to have the woman who intrigued him years ago and not have any strings since she was married. Truth to tell, there wasn't enough interaction between the two for me to believe Tatyana was more then crushing on Onegen, and the Onegen was not just attracted to a younger woman.This isn't an epic love story, perhaps the epic poem that it was writen from is, but this falls short. Oh well."
2,O Negative,"Sorry folks. Honesty is the best policy. I lust after Ralph Fiennes and though he usually wins - when he's losing - in all his films, I wonder what he was thinking when he played this role. Man, he loses big time and quite honestly, I can't stand my lovers to play a victim role. When Ralph finally figures out what he wants, he can't get it. I love Ralph Fiennes and I'll continue to see him over and again to The End of the Affair. Ralph can lose when he plays a man who knows himself and what he wants even if he is mad; one could respect his resolve. In Onegin, he gained no respect. Rafe, I'll keep waiting for the herion."
4,Onegin - a superb movie,"This movie was superb in it's setting, keeping to the dress and life and social activities of the period it was set in, the 1800's I think. If you liked Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, you'll like this one but I thought it could have gone further with the story. Besides that, a good collaboration between Ralph and his sister Martha who produced the movie with Ralph also starring as Onegin."
5,'Tis a Classic as far as I'm Concerned........,"From the moment the film begins-----with the horses and sledge thundering across the snow, and the wonderful musical score----I knew it was going to be my kind of movie. Each frame is a masterpiece-----the costumes, the sets, the attention to detail, the composition of each scene. Everyone connected with this movie should feel pride in the finished product. The last scene, with that gorgeous, haunting music in the background, and Onegin walking alone along the snow-covered St. Petersburg street is a scene I shall never forget. It's a superb film without the usual overt sex scenes, violence, and vulgar language-----what a relief!"
5,flawless cinematic masterpiece,"This is one of the best films ever made; it got shafted by critics & never opened in most US cities. But the Fiennes family really got it right-- a wonderful interpretation of the Pushkin masterpiece. Ralph acts & produces, Martha directs, Magnus writes an amazing score that you'd swear was authentically Russian. Amazing location, sets, costumes, script, casting, acting (see Liv Tyler bloom before your very eyes!), plot, cinematography & music!! For fans of Jane Austen-based films, or other stories that have virtuous, rather than happy, endings. See the film, read the poem, impress your friends. (Pronounced awn-nyay-ghin)."
2,Onegin off Again,"I love Finnes and the period, however, this movie is a mixed bag. I love the period pieces, and this movie certainly has beautiful scenery. I think the characters are a bit stilted, probably the direction, and yet, I liked it. It won't be my fav, but it's part of my collection."
3,ONEGIN,"ONEGIN (1999), starring Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler, depicts the self-effacing life of a privileged Russian who finds that opportunities do not often knock twice. The plot of star-crossed lovers is certainly not new, but both Fiennes and Tyler exert engaging performances. The dichotomy of love and ill-timing is played out well. For those who enjoy period pieces, the film is worth watching. The ending is somewhat anti-climatic, but the story is not without its good points."
3,Casting Error,"Having read Pushkin's novel, this movie does an admirable job in keeping with the tone of the book. However, the plain unrefined country girl in the novel is portrayed by the beautiful & graceful Liv Tyler. Onegin's treatment of Tatyana is conceivable in the book but rather hard to believe in the movie when it involves Ms. Tyler."
3,Wasted Ralph Fiennes Effort,"I am a great fan of Ralph Fiennes and was excited to view a film directed by his sister, Martha Fiennes. I was very disappointed, to say the least, because the costuming and scenery were beautiful, but the dialogue and editing were disjointed. The film moved along too slowly and focused too much on the brooding aspect of Ralph Fiennes character. I was ready to yell ""uncle"" by the end of the film. Liv Tyler was cast perfectly for her character and amazed me by her dramatic effort. The ending was a total let-down given the quality of the Puskin material and high level of actors. I think the director and producer focused too much on being artistic when they should have just told the story."
4,Pleasantly surprised by Liv Tyler,"I admit, I had strong reservations about this movie. I just couldn't picture Liv Tyler as Tatiana. I saw her in ""That Thing You Do"" and just couldn't imagine her doing costume drama, especially based on a classical Russian poem. I rented the movie mainly for Ralph Fiennes. And then I was pleasantly surprised. Granted, this was not an Oscar performance on behalf of Liv Tyler, but she did not ruin the movie. She has a very otherworldly face, which suits the character she was playing."
2,Truly awful!,"The roles have been so poorly miscast that this movie is simply unbearable to watch. Liv Tyler is insufferable as Tatyana, completely out of her realm in capturing the nuances of this character. Fiennes is a good actor but is too old to play Onegin, who was barely past 20 and had an affected sense of disattachment with society as a prvileged young son of Russian society would.The movie trudges along trying to fill in the scenes with an insipid dialog that hardly does the poetic novel justice. The verse novel was written mostly in the third person with very little dialog, which would force any film maker into constructing much of it, but here we see a lovely novel reduced to the level of soap opera. Do yourself a favor and read the novel rather than waste an insufferable two hours watching this movie."
2,Onegin review,"Based on the other reviews I read, I ordered this DVD. Yes, the scenery was great and the costumes were wonderful, but I was bored stiff and couldn't quite understand why the movie had to be so slow. There is a lot of scenes that could have been left out and still been an okay movie. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone. To me, this wasn't a love story in the truest sense. Tatyana fell in love with falling in love and was a bored country girl, Onegin gave her no reason to fall in love with him, he had NO endearing qualities.So, rent it, don't buy it."
2,"Good Actors, Terrible Movie","This movie is...ridiculous! What a waste of the actors' talents! Lovely faces, great costumes, picturesque scenery but completely lacking the irony, the allusions, and the intricate brilliance of its namesake. Where is the life in this movie?!Anyone who is thinking about watching it, please, read Pushkin's novel first. There are not many good English translation, but anything is better than this movie."
5,Beautiful cinematic,"This story was originally a Russian Opera. And although I have a tendency to prefer Opera, the movie is by far better! Liv Tyler plays the most convincing Tatyana. And I could not think of a better actor for the role of Onegin himself than Ralph Fiennes. The only disappointment was that there were no Russian accents. But that's Hollywood for you. The visuals were stunning, and locations picturesque, and the characters very much real and alive. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in classics and tragic romance."
1,Enough!,"Such masterpieces as Onegin, Anna Karenina should NOT be made into movies!!! They should be read. No movie will ever do justice to either of those novels."
1,. . . AND a Horrible DVD Transfer!,"Skipping over the arguments about the actual film, someone needs to point out the horrendous image quality of this DVD. Lions Gate - the film's producer - passed the film onto a no-name company called Sterling Home Entertainment. This DVD looks as if were made from a VHS tape of a television broadcast. In the theater, this was a wonderful film to look at. What I just saw on my screen is awful, like a homeless public-domain title anyone can download and sell copies of. I looked up Sterling Home Entertainment; they seem to be producers and distributors of unwanted and unloved films. Great move, Lions Gate."
3,It's alright!,"This is a movie i never heard of. I love Liv Tyler and she is so beautiful in it. But the lack of love and romance made it boring for me. I really, really wanted to like this movie. But of course i don't like it very much and now i want to get rid of it :( So that's why i give it a 3, not enough smooching!"
2,omentum,I'm trying to reduce omentum. Haven't changed diet. No improvement after one bottle. Will try another. If no improvement I will give it up.
2,Tonalin,I have been trying this product for a couple of weeks and I have NOT noticed any difference since doing so.
3,Love this stuff,Do your research and make sure this is what you want. Great value and it give just a little extra kick when needed
5,"Most comfortable, durable jeans I know.",I have worn the Riggs by Wrangler for nearly 10 years. Most comfortable and durable jeans I have ever owned. Have a gusseted crotch which is one of the best features. And I like the big pockets and leather pocket protector.
4,Bright and Cheery,"Very colorful childrens book. My 18 month old son is loves this book especially because of the ""large size"" illustration of the boys. (He points to them and smiles!)The story is also sweet!"
5,very cute,My 2 year old has fallen in love with trains and this book is very cute. It is definitely made for the younger children but the pictures are very well done.
5,Maisy Rocks!,"My 2 year old loves Maisy and he loves trains so this was an excellent purchase! The Maisy books are well made, have cute pictures, easy to follow stories, and they are great for young pre-schoolers. My son has learned the story and now reads it to me. :)"
3,Maisy Takes a Turn as the Engineer,"If you are the parent of a young child, you probably know who Maisy is. She's a mouse with a duck, a squirrel, an elephant, and a crocodile for friends. Why the crocodile isn't trying to eat the others is beyond me, but that's life in Maisy's world.Both of my daughters love the Maisy books; there's something about their simple stories and colorful pictures that even appeals to adults. The books are short and easy to read. But, the stories are never obnoxiously simplistic, like so many other books for small children.This is one of the shorter Maisy books, and it is less appealing to three-to-four year olds than her other books. Still, my two year old hasn't tired of it yet. Masiy's an engineer in this one, taking all her friends for a ride through the country."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this for my juvenile Chameleon thinking it was a great idea. It is a great idea, IDEA that is. This product is just some cheap plastic tubing you can find at home depot for $1, with some very low quality plastic leaves wrapped around it, which is also very poorly put together. Save yourself some money and either don't buy this or make your own for 1/4 of the price."
4,Helpful concise safety tips for motorcyclists,"This book is an easy read of some 207 pages, all of which are related to safe operation of a motorcycle. Many anecdotal examples are used to describe various potential safety hazards and situations to the motorcyclists and methods used to avoid injury in each. Chapters include proper clothing for protection, surface hazards, speed related risks, weather, right-of-way and intersection hazards, making yourself 'seen' on a motorcycle, lane positioning, passing traffic, proper turns, and much more. Actual cases are presented and advice on what an operator should have done to avoid the risks. While the book went to press in 1980, none of the road risks have changed. Essential reading for anyone who rides a motorcycle and should be adjunctive to an accredited motorcycle safety riding course."
5,Baby's Room is a must,"For the My First Dollhouse, the ""Baby's Room"" is a must! My daughter is 6 and has had it since she was 3 and is still delighted and plays with it often! Baby needs a place to sleep ya know!"
2,looks older,comes very cheap but it actually looks older and get easily damaged in washing machines. again for this cheap price of 10$ what else do you expect. i am happy if it last for 2 summer months
3,Not Bad As A Whole,"This cd isnt bad but it aint awesome either. Its just well....good. Its a good listen. No real standout tracks here. (though the last 2 break the mold, not counting the last song without KJ) The songs are short about 2-3 minutes with the chorus being repeated at the end for another minute. The intermissions were okay but could have been better. The music was pretty good, some songs better than others. I think that this project was probably rushed, maybe by KJ because his Peace Of Mind album was great though i understand these musical styles differ. All in all this cd can not be broken up into parts to like it. If you listen to this cd as one song or as one piece its good. This cds strength? Great groovin music to listen to as you and your girl or friend talk in the car."
5,In a perfect world...,"...this album would show up on those ""100 greatest albums ever"" lists that pop up occassionally in Rolling Stone or on VH1, etc. It is just unconscionable that there would be a mere 11 reviews (as I write this) for such a wonderful album (and some of them are negative - seriously?). Now, I must admit that I was not thrilled with this album when I first heard it. It was very different from what I'd heard before (No Borders Here and The Speckless Sky). Gone were the synths and drum machines and the new-wavish/alternative sound. In their place was something that sounded (to me, initially) like country (something I detest). But I gave it time and found that the album grew on me. It is not country (although some of the tracks are infused with a country-ish feel). It is organic: acoustic (mostly) guitars, piano, accordion. This music has depth and an ineffable beauty. After all these years, I find I am still deeply moved by these songs."
1,Bound (and Gagged) by the Beauty,"Being a Starbucks junkie has its price, and that price is having to sit through Siberry's title track ""Bound (and gagged) by the Beauty."" It is painful to listen to. It is way too sing-songy, with Lilith-Fair-ish inflections, and in spots, it repeats like a broken record. Seriously, I was going to tell the staff that ""their CD player is broken,"" but realized that they actually recorded the song that way!! Instead of putting my hands to my ears and praying, ""Jesus, please make it stop,"" I now just walk outside the store for a few minutes---or leave a little earlier."
5,Enthralled,"This is a fabulous album. It seems to move along at an ever increasing speed, through the humerous ""Everything Reminds Me of My Dog"" and ""I Coulda Been Miss Punta Blanca"" to the incredibly musical ""Are We Dancing"" finale. The latter combines a strange languidness with a feverish sense of racing toward a climax. Beautiful, beautiful CD. One of the all time favourites in my collection."
4,Farside Classic,"The first time I heard Farside I didn't know quite what to think,since I had just recently been introduced to this type of music. It wasn't really punk,it wasn't really hardcore and back then none of us knew what emo was.All I knew was that this record rocked .I couldn't get enough.They blended beautiful melodies,vocal harmonies insightful lyrics and all around incridible musicianship into one of the greatest records I have ever heard to this day.I only gave 4 stars rather than 5,because they only got better."
3,Say hello to the bugs.....,"This is one way to eventually introduce your players to Bug City. I don't want to give it away, but you're players are hired to get back this trid star that keeps getting into trouble. But, it just so happens somebody is out to make her a queen of a hive, and nothing your players do will stop it from happening. It would be best to run this campaign for brand new players to shadowrun who have really no clue what bug shamans are, or anything that happened in Bug City. What you won't find is any refference to the U.Brotherhood, but I'm sure if your players live, you can run them through the Missing Blood or Double Exsposure adventure with no problems......."
2,Lazy Performance,"Pros:Rechargable (The good lies in not needing batteries. If I had a choice, corded clippers are better.)Cons:Poor at trimming facial hair (fully charged, it might work a little if you have really soft hair.)Subpar to Poor at shaping up hairline (it does a decent job at trimming my arm hair but then again I don't have any)If you don't know yet, Andes is the way to go if you're a man looking for a decent clipper. Wahl is also pretty good. Everything else...is just a toy.But seriously, a ConAir trimmer is to an Andes like a Coby brand CD player is to a Yamaha or Bose multi-unit stereo system."
2,Can't hold a charge,"As other reviews have said, this razor fails to hold a charge. I usually keep it plugged in for 4-6 hours at a time, and despite the lengthy charge time, this razor never keeps anything beyond a 5 minute charge. Luckily I only use it to trim down a goatee, because it only takes about 3 or 4 minutes total to do so. Granted, the clip sizes are perfect if you just want to quickly shave your goatee or perhaps trim your sideburns or beard, but the pathetic charge time won't get you much. The beard trimmer attachment is also very flimsy and doesn't attach properly to the clipper head.Overall, not a wise investment. You'll spend more time charging it than you will using it."
1,Why do you sell this?,"My experience is similar to the other reviewers. The second time I used it one of the comb/spacer attachments fell on the floor and broke eliminating the optimal length for me. The unit never held a charge between uses, and now, after only a few months won't take a charge at all. Even if I had kept my sales receipt, I wouldn't bother to ship it back for warranty repair or replacement. It is in the trash where it belongs. Why does Target continue to sell such a useless product that all the customers complain about?"
1,This razor is horrible,"I think my razor worked three times. It is dead now. The blades will move for three seconds, stick for ten, move for two seconds, stick for 15, ...."
4,"Buy the EBX2, same thing, but cheapper!","EBX II has the same songs.Finally realeased the classic ERASURE from the 80's on CD. Had the 12"" Vinyl of these songs and was looking everywhere for them. Finally for all of ERASURE's fans, we can have ""A LITTLE RESPECT"", ""CHAINS OF LOVE"" and VICTIM OF LOVE"" on CD. no more scratchy retro 80's remixes..""Ship of fools is"" ... mmmm. ok, I guess. Should have included ""SOMETIMES"" instead.The Circus has live versions of their first singles. Great version of ""Oh L'amour"". Good value for 3 hard-2-find CD singles, 1 CD live, and 1 so so song.WARNING: These re-mixes sound really dated (totally 80's). Good for listening in your house, but not to be listened on your car with the bass booming. Kinda makes you fell a little queer. Oh well long live the 80's!"
5,Every Song Is Amazing,I love every song on the album. I love Jimmy Needham. He has a smooth deep voice and always giving glory to God. You gotta love him. I do. God Bless you Jimmy.
5,Rangers & Romance - a Winning Combination,"These tales of a bygone day, when Texas Rangers struggled to tame the young state, are exciting, romantic, and uplifting. These wholesome stories touched my heart."
1,Inferior product,"The nose evokes the earthiness of white truffles, just barely. The white truffle presence in Bartolini is weak with mineral (almost chemical) notes, not the earthy, warm and almost intoxicating fragrance you expect from white truffles.There is no such thing as white truffles (oil or otherwise) on a budget. The real thing is expensive, a deserving price for the experience you expect."
4,SWEET,"If your looking for a clean cutting blade for your circular saw look no further.This one has it all.This is truely a sweet blade. In my opinion it's top notch and splinter free.Thin kerf,re-sharpenable carbide tips and, dewalts reputation of excellence. That say's it all.Now get out there and make some dust."
5,Excellant Blade,I recently had to build a new deck and bought this blade for that project. Usually I just pick up an inexpensive blade and toss is at the end of a project. There is a world of difference between this blade and the usual $10 throw away blade. I used this blade to cut 2X treaded and redwood lumber. The blade cuts much more efficiently and the cuts are much cleaner and splinter free and the saw seems to just glide through the cut. The deck is finished now and the blade is still sharp. I will have is sharpened when is becomes dull. Highly recommend this blade!
2,the zipper broke on the big part of the backpack,the zipper on the big section of the backpack broke within one week of use.
4,The Paperback Version...,"...Of this book only contains the essays. It does not contain the original comics, nor are the illustrations in color. The essays are wonderful and thoughtful. Bottom line: If you want the comics the original version contained (and which the essays reference), you will need to buy the hardcover version. I'd actually rate this book 3.5 stars, but can't give half stars."
1,Not so good packaging,"Two out of seven tapes were broken. Packaging was not very good, no bubble wrap or anything. They just put the tapes in a box and mailed them. Shipping was pretty good though."
3,THE COOL DOBERMANS,"The Doberman Gang was a silly yet fun and original film, that became a cult classic because above all is cool, entertaining and unpretencious, therefore it doesn't matter if it is believable or not, it's a movie and evrything can happen whithin a movie, as long as it is truthful to the characters and the plot and this one is. A 70's classic!."
5,!!!THE DOBERMAN GANG LIVES!!!!!,"Watching this movie after soooo many years brought back fond memories. I experienced the same warmth and excitment seeing it again as I did when it was first shown on t.v.!! It is worth the price. I am well pleased with the quality and sound of the movie. This is a true classic. Can't wait to show it to the rest of my family and friends to enjoy. It is one of the very few videos that children can watch,too! I was not too pleased with the delayed delivery but the seller did respond to my concerns immediately and I received my order soon after! Hence, the 5 star rating!. Thank you!"
1,Absolute POS; Hippy Dippy = Cwappy Wappy,"I'm embarrassed for Levi Seacer Jr. His name is on this album, he PLAYS on this album, but nowhere is his musical talent exhibited on this album.I purchased this at a store, hoping I had found another possibly treasure from the Prince + co cache.What an amazing disappointment. Only in the 90's. There were endless useless ""dance remixes"" of every popular song back in the day, and they all sounded as cheap as a $100 CASIO keyboard drum loop.I understand other people suggesting this influenced a prose over ethereal music style, but this music is so banal and repetitive, devoid of groove and the lyrics are absolutely retarded. YES, juvenille, STUPID....retarded.I, of course...returned it. Absolute crap. Prince completists beware. Stick to MADHOUSE or THE FAMILYThis album just made my bowels move, I gotta go."
3,Nice but not what i was looking for,"I thought I finally found a song I have been searching for far and wide. I believe I did, but the remix I heard and loved was, in my opinion, much better than the original. If you enjoy spoken word set to a beat, you will love it. For me, however, not so much."
2,very durable,"I received this gummy bacon as a gag gift & I guess it did make me gag! It's pretty gross to eat, but it makes a fine conversation piece to display & always makes people laugh. I've had it for a few years and it's still in it's gummy, pliable state. I do wish it wasn't strawberry bacon flavored - not a good combo."
2,Fun but gross,"This candy does have a great bacon appearance, however it tastes like strawberry plastic.. Very plastic flavor. Gross. Fun as a gag gift. I just don't recommend eating it as the flavor is unpalatable."
1,Ok...Why?,"Strawberry flavored gummy bacon? Why is it not bacon flavored? This is about as useless as candy cigarettes. Even if it was bacon flavored, I still don't see the point. Go buy some real bacon and get on with your life. Heart disease be damned! If you can't live an enjoyable life, making life longer would just be extended misery. Go for the bacon."
2,Easy Puzzles are Harder than They Should Be,"I was given this book after doing sudoku puzzles for a few weeks from USAToday and my local paper. The easy puzzles are more difficult than they should be. In fact, the ones marked 3 stars on graph of 1-5 in USA Today are more like the easy ones in this book. I don't recommend this book to a brand new beginner because I think you'll be frustrated."
2,Lots of practice puzzles not much instruction,I thought this book would provide more tactics on solving but it really has lots of practice puzzles at 3 levels -- from easy to difficult.
1,For beginners only,"If the price is worth getting 240 puzzles, buy it; otherwise, save your money because the instructions are not sufficient to help you past the basic level."
2,"Not bad, not good","This book is okay for beginners. The one mentioned in an earlier review, ""Master Sudoku"" by Carol Vorderman is much better. By the way, don't pay attention to that dipwad's review on ""Master Sudoku"". She is clueless thinking that ""those little numbers in squares"" (pencil marks) are unimportant and that the girl on the cover of the Master Sudoku book is arbitrary -- she's not -- that's actually Carol Vordeman (brains and beauty), the author of the book.But pass on ""dummies"" and go for the ""master"""
1,Simple Sudoku,Much better explanations and free games available on-line. Disappointed in solving strategies section which was very basic and not very helpful beyond the easy phase of solutions.
3,Inappropriate for Dummies,"Su Doku for Dummies has a lot of puzzles but is not really a ""Dummies"" book. In my opinion, a ""Dummies"" book carefully and completely teaches the procedure or concept. This book does not teach very well.First, the text does not begin with a careful explanation of the game. True, it does provide a bit of history and gives the two basic rules: Each column, row, and box must contain all of the numbers 1 through 9; and no column, row, or box can contain two squares with the same number. The book, however, is deficient in its presentation of the logic of solving the puzzles. Instead, it gives us only a few basic hints.Second, the puzzles are presented in mixed levels of difficulty, instead of segregating the easier from the more difficult. Some of the puzzles that are labeled ""easy"" are actually more difficult and some labeled more difficult are actually easy.This book is ok for a book of puzzles, but I do not recommend it for beginners."
5,I'm hooked on Su Doku!,"My mother has been doing these puzzles with my daughter for some time now, and I haven't the faintest clue how to tackle one of these. Leave it to Dummies to come to my rescue with this book! It not only shows what the puzzles are about, and how to do one, but gives you lots of puzzles to satisfy your Su Doku jones. And, after reading this book, I definitely have a yen for more Su Doku!"
2,Not that helpful.,"This book was my introduction to sudoku. Beyond the introductory techniques, I found the instructions confusing and hard to follow. Additionally, this book suggests putting ""small"" numbers in the squares for ""possible number solutions"". This was very messy and led to constant erasures. I highly recommend ""Master Sudoku"" by Vorderman. While I don't see the need for a photo of a very attractive woman on the cover of a puzzle book, the book itself is great. I am doing medium difficulty puzzles after two days and am already looking forward to moving on to the more difficult puzzles. Have fun!"
4,Great intro to Su Doku with helpful instructions,"This is a good book if you are new work Su Doku puzzles. It has good definitions of terms, but it also has a few typos in the instructions which caused some confusion. I had to reread the sections a couple of times before I understood what was being said. However, once past that, I was able to begin working the puzzles. A good variety of easy, medium and difficult puzzles. I am not too please with the paper content; it does not hold up well to eraser marks."
1,The Wrong Book,"This is the wrong book to get for any level. Master Sudoku is better in all ways. The intro in Master Sudoku beats the Dummy and the content is so so.I have both books. I learned very little from Dummy, Master sent me on my way to doing Sudoko well."
4,decent,"I thought the explanations of how the puzzles work were pretty clear...I have seen worse anyway. Immediately following the tutorial are 240 puzzles, that are organized by difficulty from easy to diabolically difficult, and solutions in the back. I haven't seen enough of the Sudoku books that are out there to make a lot of comparisons, but overall I felt like this book was worth the price."
4,Good Collection of puzzles but not the best,"Sudoku for Dummies is a book that accomplishes the primary two purposes of the book1.) introduce and teach the addictive but simplistic game of sudoku2.)offer a good range of puzzlesIt is a good value for your money too, but still you should not purchase this, and here's why1.) sudoku for dummies has a second and third volume, both which are basically revisions of the first, and they are slightly better in every way.buy sudoku for dummies volume 3.2.) The spaces are too small for the hard puzzles and you'll have to enlarge it on a scanner."
2,Where's the information?,"I have to say that if you never tried a Sudoku puzzle you may get the basics from Sudoku for Dummies, but that's about it. The authors present the first (relatively difficult) puzzle and begin solving it with some basic strategy. Then for some bizarre reason, half way through the explanation, the authors leave the reader to finish the most difficult part of the puzzle on his own. I could not find the solution to this one anywhere. In the next section they switch to another puzzle that is taken to completion but without delving into any logic that goes beyond the obvious. The majority of the book consists of actual puzzles. However, I wanted strategies for solving the puzzles not just some workbook. If you have no idea how to begin to solve a Sudoku puzzle, you may find some value in this book. Otherwise, you will probably feel that you bought an overpriced puzzle book."
1,Norelco HP2750 Ladyshave Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver,A waste of money. It does not shave close enough. Using a razor carefully to avoid cuts is still the best way to get smooth legs.
5,"Not all wet, Dry Dry Again.","The Norelco HP2750 is great wet. I'll admit it. Before work I enjoy a morning swim, but I don't have time for that and time to get properly ready for work. One morning in particular I was really craving a swim, so as an experiment I brought my handy Norelco with me. I got in some bouyant quality time and had a great shave. The beauty of it all, the YMCA has great filters on their pools so, clean up is a snap. This thing is a real time saver. It may be for dry shaving environments, however, there is one fact I cannot stress enough. While this shaver is great for my face. I must say, it is NOT for the entire body. Please folks, I cannot stress this enough."
2,Don't Need This Gadget,"Although the electric razor gave a decent shave, it was not any better or faster than shaving with regular razor. My $1 razor actually was easier to use. This gadget is simply a waste of money."
3,Pretty much another rehash,"There is only so much you can write about the whole Pistols lore. As the number of books written about the Pistols increases, the material contained within remains the same or in some cases diminishes.If you've never read anything by Savage or Lydon or even Monk/Guterman, then this would be a fairly enjoyable read. If you have read those authors then this tome contains nothing you've not already read."
5,great filter,"I just got and tested this filter,it connected to my sink very easy.it has a switch so you can select filter or bypass the filter unit.it worked well and the water tastes good,I did not want a pressurized tank like most systems have, I know that makes it a little slow, but its not that slow, I just set a water pitcher under it while I cook dinner, one liter in 6 min. with my regular city water pressure.and because there is no pressure tank this system is really portable.just perfect for someone that wants to take a system with them.it kind of looks like you could build it your self, its really simple, looks easy to fix and maintain.no more evil fluoride, MTBE or other bad things in my water anymore.good price as well."
1,"Very poor customer service, questionable company.","I purchased this system, and while the product itself is good, the customer service the company is providing is beyond poor. The package did not include the two replacement filters that I ordered and paid for. I contacted the company through the email and they told me that I need to just go away and check the packaging again to find something that clearly was never mailed to me. The two filters are a bit too big in size to miss, really. I called them again, and the customer service representative was very unhelpful and very rude, tried to get rid of me with a vague promise of a call back. Finally, after my persistence, they agreed to mail the filters, so I will have to see how it goes or whether I will have to refund this part of the purchase through the credit card bank."
3,Counter top filter,"The water tastes great after running through this filter. However, I have a well and pump and it works very slow because my water pressure runs 30 to 50 lbs. States that it needs 50lbs to work properly. Does work with less but slowly. Also I have a whole house filter and this filter wastes 80% of the water.This is not that economical but does insure you have good filtered water rather than taking someone else's word for it.Runs straight from the tap in your sink. My sinks aren't deep enough to put a large bottle in, so I must put a small bottle and then pour it into a larger container. You cannot just leave this running, it requires attention."
1,Instructions blurry,if they cant make a clean instruction sheet how can i trust they made a product that can truly clean water. i am going to pass
1,Not Appropriate for Young Children,"The overall theme of this story can be frightening to young children (10 and under). The situations where Molly's parents are in jeopardy can be disturbing. While the reading level is listed as 9-12, I would consider this more appropriate for readers 12 and up due to the subject matter."
1,Are you people crazy,"Are you people crazy. This book should not be in the school library, much less read in class to the students age 10 and under. My son came home and started telling me parts of the story. He has been having bad dreams for a few days and I never understood why. I now know. I am extremely upset that this book is being read to children age 9 and under. I read the book in one sitting and was very disturbed. I will be discussing my concerns with the teacher."
1,"""If you buy this I bet yull be sorry""","The book had about 1% suspenc in it. I would like to rate it -1,000,000,000. I do not get scared that offten but this book just freaked me out. One of the naranaitors used-to-be favorite storys was when this one lazy guy brunt him self and sucked on his finger to cooll it and he ate all of his flesh and his realativs. I could go on forever how I dislike this but instead I will just say DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, YOU WILL PROPALY GET FREAKED OUT AND NOT LIKE IT."
2,The Skeleton Man,"The Boring BookAfter Ray Bond turned 18 years old, his uncle gives him $30,000.00 in cash and places it on a vault in a bank. The next day Ray's uncle is found dead, an apparent suicide. Then someone starts following him and calling him. And the threats begin.I dislike the book because it's boring and confusing. There are too many characters that want the same thing and act kind of the same. Ray is really dumb; he gets mad about everything and acts like a little kid. He treats his really bad and doesn't like to talk to her. Also Ray acts really mean to his girlfriend."
4,One Scarey Dream!!,"If you decide to read this book,I want to give you some advice, never read this before going to bed!! When I read this it gave me nightmares. But probaly because I read it under the covers at night. That was a mistake!!This story is about this girl named Molly. Who one night was at home when her parents were out for dinner. At least that is what she thought but she gets worried when her parents don't come home. She goes to her thought to be uncle. But that is all a lie. This uncle is the Skeleton Man. He has her parents buried under his shed. But they are alive. In Molly's dreams she gets help from a little rabit.This story is filled of excitment with every page."
4,Skeleton Man,"Prepare to be scared! Although based on a Native American tale the author makes you feel as though Molly (the main character) could be anyone in your classroom. When she wakes up to find her parents are not home and that days later they still do not arrive, the eerie tale begins. Molly learns she must trust her intuition and dreams that lead her to know the truth about what is happening to her and what has happened to her parents. Her strength and initiative (warrior instincts) are what gets her through. Not the ending I expected with a children's book , but showing girls can be strong and solve problems makes this a book I would recommend to those who dare to be scared."
3,Not scary,What are you people talking about? This book isn't scary! It shouldn't even be classified as horror! I admit though I probably would of been scared of this stuff when I was 5 or 6. It was okay though but I felt like they didnt show skeleton man very much.
4,Truly spooky,"A truly spooky book about a strong and gutsy girl. I've never been a big fan of horror or scary stories, neither as a child nor as an adult, but this was worth facing my fears to read! And really, it's spooky rather than scary."
3,Decent Mystery,"This is a much better mystery than many of the others that are out there for the age group.The good: The length of the book is perfect. It appeals to students that don't want to read. The cover is decent, students find the cover appealing enough to pick up the book (and that is often half the battle). The story detail makes it easy to visualize what is happening.The bad: Parts of the book do drag. The connection between the dreams and the ""actual"" events may be hard to make for many 10 year olds, causing some confusion with the ending. There are a lot of unexplained events. Too many for my opinion.Overall, yeah, students pick it up. Some get it more than others. But, for the most part, they want to read it."
4,"A great, scary, and exciting book","Skeleton Manis a scary book and a great book at the same time. Unlike most books, i couldn't put this book down! It got me scared at some points. Skelton Man is a great character. the author did an excellent job trying to make a modern type monster. Sometimes I would stare at the words on the page, other times I would give a sigh of relief. I loved the setting and reasons for the story. it really is a terrific book!!!~"
5,exciting,"our 7th-grader chose this among other options for summer reading, and couldn't put it down--very exciting and fast-paced"
1,Pass on this book - not suitable for children,"Within the first few pages of this book is a very disturbing and graphic scene where a man eats his finger, himself (piece by piece), and his relatives.This is written to be a horror novel for teens - if your child is sensitive and/or prone to nightmares this novel will disturb them greatly.Cannibalism, kidnapping, and child abuse - this book is disturbing on so many levels.Parents - this book is often read (though I cannot fathom why) to children in grades 4, 5, and 6, especially around Halloween and/or as a ""Native American Legend"". Most parents will find that it is not appropriate as a mandatory reading assignment or a read-aloud story in your child's classroom. There are much better books for teachers to choose that would support their curriculum without scarring and scaring children."
1,nauseous.,"My son came home literally heaving and very disturbed by the canibalistic story, after the first chapter was read to him in school.My son is a voracious reader, including the works of J.R.R.Tolkien, however the nature of this story made it highly unsuitable for him. He is nine."
4,I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watching Me,"Skeleton Man by Joseph Bruchac is a mystery waiting to be solved by Molly, a girl that wakes up one morning to find that her parents are missing. After waiting for her parents to return home, Social Services intervenes, talks to her, and eventually forces her to live with an unknown uncle. Molly is horrified because he locks her in her room each night, and she suspects that he is poisoning her food. After some investigation, Molly finds hidden cameras all throughout the house. Even though Molly is terrified of this uncle, she believes that he is the key to the whereabouts of her parents.Read the suspenseful story to find out if Molly's parents are ever found. This Corning, AR class enjoyed each page of this book."
5,Molly and a Skeleton,"Skeleton Man is by Joseph Bruchac is a mystery book about a girl named Molly. Her parents always makes breakfast on Sunday, but when she woke up she didn't hear anything. She was worried. She yelled ""MOM"" ""DAD"" nobody answered. She went into the living room and turned on the TV when she saw her parents car on TV. A Social Services lady showed her to a relitave who was called her ""uncle"" took Molly to his house and showed her to her room. That night she had a dream about a man that looked like her ""uncle."" Every night he would lock her room. She discovered a shed with a new lock at her ""uncles"" house. I wonder what's in it. Read the GREAT book and be ready to be scared. Find out what's in the shed and where her parents are.(...)"
1,Hardcore!?,"Ok, my friend told me this band was an insane straight edge hardcore band... Umm... first of all, this isnt hardcore, its freaking metal. Hardcore is like Black Flag, Minor Threat, Negative Approach, etc... All this is straight edge militant metal. Seriously, many of the ""hardcore"" kids who listen to this stuff go out and kick peoples ass just because they smoke or drink. Wow that sure is what sXe is about, beating someone up because they think diferently than you. That sure is unity. Now im not saying all of these kids do that, but there sure in hell are alot of em. Metalcore is not hardcore, get it right. If you like metal get this cd. If you like ACTUAL hardcore pass on this one and pick up ""Total Recall"" by Negative Approach."
1,ITS MILLER TIME!,"X poop X.you hardcore kids should pick up as much change as possible, take it all to a record store, and buy some new cds.garbage."
5,"Great album, uncluttered sound","It's just good ole' hardcore with no icing, no fancy clothes, no makeup, no BS. It's hardcore. It's in your face. One of their better albums."
3,"Could have been better, Sorry Guys!!!!!","I thought that this movie was slow I expected more martial arts and a lot better story line from this movie, having read all the reviews on this I thought that I was going to see this awesome movie but I was wrongly mistaken.This movie had the potential there but it lost it and was quite confusing in bits as well as being slow.My recommendation is to see the movie first before you buy it."
1,Ah. I spent to much to rent this,I was expecting this movie to be great considering this was the guy from Brotherhood of the Wolf. What a disappointment. I fast forward through alot but still couldn't bring myself to finish watching it. The plot is slow and the actions sequences look like a TV shows.
2,the only good songs,the only songs worth listening to here are the first three song. everything else is garbage.save your money!!
2,average run of the mill,"Most of these recordings are run of the mill, everyday and quite common. I would like to see more obscure quality comedy that one doesn't find on every comedy CD. I can truely compile as many recordings as this (some of the same) and still come up with a better selection.Wanda M. Smith"
3,A little small,Does the job as advertised.....company could have spent a few more pennies and made it a little deeper (front to back) to protect the exposed end.
3,useful item,"The sleeve is a soft suede-like thing. It's good for protecting the computer from scratches, but it's not thick enough to prevent it from bumping. That's hard to tell from the online description. The device to protect the surface inside the computer from hand dirt and scratches is very useful to have, since my oily skin always left a mark on the computer before I put this on."
4,Good television with 1 flaw,"We have had this television for 3 years and it is still working great. I like the 32"" telivision because of the cost savings over a 36"", and I don't find the picture to be that much smaller.The only drawback to JVC is that the buttons may break off and push into the television. My warranty was not honored as this was sited as accedental or incedental damage. I find it to be design error. My wife and I took the television apart and fixed it ourselves. We use the remote instead of the buttons now.Beside this flaw, I still like the picture quality, and no electronic problems have occured."
5,Five Stars for Telling It Like It Is,"Thank you to David Horovitz for having the courage to present both sides of the internal Israeli debate cogently and, most impressively, sensitively. One need only visit Israel to know how passionately and fiercely people hold on to their arguments about just about anything. But Horovitz clearly is wrestling with the thousand and one challenges of living in Israel and raising a family there, recognizing the grays where others see only black and white. Kudos to him and to ""A Little Too Close to God."""
2,No Poetry with his Politics,"Sorry, but I couldn't get with this non-fictional narrative, too lacking in any poetics for my taste. Might be a fine book, just too loud and too little nuanced for this reader."
1,Avoid at all costs,"Horovitz reveals, and revels in, his hatred for all things Jewish and Israeli. He should have stayed at home in England doing whatever it is he does best instead of travelling to Israel with his obvious prejudices."
1,A Little To Close to His Ego,"If we are to believe the author, he alone could have saved Prime Minister Rabin from an assasin's bullet. And also that his own family is pivotal to Israeli's political life, their elections. Though the author can be credited with a certain immediacy, he was mostly writing in his journal for and about his family. The book is not well organized. It jumps around and assumes too much interest in his personal life and not enough about the great world all around him. And his self promotion runs throughout.."
3,"I found this book good reference,that's all.Along with other",As all who feel the need for spiritual hunger the study of many ways is needed to find what is right for the soul. As a few would say. Many years of pursicution and death did their toll to quiet all beliefes. And only with reading the many books written to find what that person is wanting.will help bring the old ways back. We all have old souls that hunger for spiritual food.
3,"Still a classic, but barely","I bought this book because for a long time it was considered one of the classic works offered in the early neopagan movement, at least as far as ""early"" and ""classic"" go in neopaganism. Although I find the rituals applicable and the information accurate, there are some key points left out that a beginning pagan needs to know such as closing rituals etc. I think this was written on the supposition that much of the traditions were still secret, and this was certainly written before people protested aligning Wicca with general paganism. I intend to keep this book on my shelf for historical interest -- it tells more about what paganism was in the VietNam era than it does about practicality and practice. An advanced practitioner can readapt much of the information so it is useful, or use it for fodder to start a scholarly study although the book itself is hardly scholarly."
4,dated maybe but still,"Ok this is an old book. It has been around for a long time and is somewhat dated. Yes it is of value for the historical role and place.And yetThe rituals are clear and tight and moving and easily performed. But there are other books which have still more rituals at least as goodand yet...Maybe the most attractive points of the book are the two essays-One is somewhat dated but the second, Pagan Musings. remains a beautiful expression of hope. It brings us back to a more idealistic time. Perhaps a time we long for and can work toward.Frankly I think it is worth it just for this one essay.Yes get it for the rituals and for the history. But on those days when you are running a bit low on inspiration and are a bit down, Take it out and read Pagan Musings again. It might give you what you need to go on."
3,Not bad as a reference,"This book is fairly well-written, and has some very good information in it, but a lot of the wording and rituals are rather Dianic (female-oriented, focusing mainly on the Goddess) and the coven rituals are designed for largish covens of roughly equally divided gender ... so they may need some altering to work for other situations. Very ceremonial, has some good incantations, and some decent info in the back. Plus, it has that simple and stylish cover!"
3,"""classic"" mayby, but there's better...","If you already have a good grounding you can fill in the gaps... but I think there's better. I was looking for rite of passage rituals, but I found better info in... Pagan Rites of Passage!(By Pauline Campanelli). This was centered at dianic covens and today most pagans are solitary and I prefer a more balanced approach. Anyway... That can't detract from the fact it was a 'must have' for many years. It just isn't now."
2,Misleading Title,This book is entirely devoted to the Goddess and has nothing about the God. This book is a book about GODDESS rituals and not PAGAN rituals.
5,20 Best Italian Love Songs - Inspiring and very enjoyable!,"I first heard this CD being played at a local Italian Restaurant that my wife and I dined at. Although I am not Italian, I was happy that I was able to find it on Amazon.com, at a very reasonable price. Since receiving this CD, I have been playing it often in my car. If you enjoy good Italian music, this is definitely a CD you should have."
2,Disappointing,"The soprano here is Margareta Jonth whom I have not heard before and nor would I want to hear her again. She's boring. The tenor is the late Helge Brilioth, a noted Wagnerian. If you want some well-sung Peterson-Berger songs for your Scandinavian collection then the ones to go for are Randi Stene on Simax and the intelligent and beautiful Matilda Paulsson on Caprice. Both are loaded with character and very well recorded. The Paulsson issue does not have an English translation of the song texts, so buy the Jonth issue cheap on Amazon, hoist the CD and keep the booklet which has bilingual song texts. It's not every day you come across English translations of this composer's best songs."
4,Good Shampoo,I've used this for years and just found the large size on Amazon. It was a good price. I like the feel it leaves on my scalp and my hair looks good.
4,hardcore at its peak,"if you like hardcore your gonna love this, this garden state hardcore is great from beginning to end!! Its hard to describe their music though but one4one can make a slight ressemblance & they are playing with SOIA in november in burlington shout-out to X514X Bloody fists of the Northstar & XxALEXxX@netscape.net"
4,Very Bright! On/Off Switch Could Be Better.,"I have owned three of these lights in the past few years. I'm in the autobody business and use this light all the time to illuminate hard to see areas. The light is great, however, the on/off, push button switch, eventually, fails from being turned on and off so much. I wish the manufacturer would address this issue. However, I will buy another when the time comes."
4,Strong close shave,"I bought this shaver several years ago and to this day am still enjoying a strong, close shave. I have a habit of letting the beard go for several days and have a close, comfortable shave each time. This is the best shaver I've owned to date, only surpassed by the razor for closeness, but not by much."
2,Steam Its Generation and Use,I thought this book was the new version. It's only the reprint of a very old version. There is no index and a lot of things are obsolete.The new version vey useful is Steam 41 by Babcock and Wilcox.
2,A Tim and Faith fan but...,This book lacks depth. Its information is vague. It seems like Mr. Gray wrote it by doing an internet search and reading a few magazine articles. You won't find anything new here or see any pictures that you can't locate yourself on the internet. Save your money.
1,HORRIBLE BOOK CONDITION,"I was very upset & disappointed when I got this book, ""Perfect Harmony"". This book was suppose to BE in ""NEW CONDITION"" book. This book looks like it was stored in basement or a garage with possible water damage. This book, in no way is worth the $9.99 I paid. I thankfully, have not had too many problems with ordering things thru Amazon. But even though I've had problems before, I have not been as upset as I am with this book being in such terrible conditions. I have never left a review as bad as this ever before, even when things have not worked or items have been broken. I will make sure I do not order from this dealer again. If I could rate it lower than 1, I would rate the condition as 0."
3,Half of what's advertised,"Fit and finish is very good. It replaces the OEM unit and looks identical.However, the reason I purchased this is because this vehicle has a two speed fan controlled by the engine control module.Only one speed was working on mine and gave a check engine light.This unit got rid of the CEL but doesn't have two speeds.I would have paid dealer prices for a fan that did what I was looking for.This unit is good and will probably last a long time but I now have to drive with a constant eye on the temp gauge."
3,Expensive and confusing,"I have used Norelco and their blades for years and am satisfied with their performance. The shavers last for years and the blades are easy to install. Nonetheless, the blades seem particularly expensive and pairing blade to shaver can be confusing. Seriously, how many model numbers for a particular line can one company generate?"
5,works great,"works as it should, I have since moved on to shaving cream and a razor as I am not a kid anymore and like a smooth clean shave. with an electric razor I have NEVER had a shave as clean as a razor blade can give."
4,Replacement heads,The replacement heads provided a significant improvement in closeness and comfort after several years. They take about a week to wear-in. I like to use a drop of mineral oil on each head after washing out the heads.
3,Good Repacment Good Price,Just replaced My Blades their suppose to last one year I Spend Therty dollers In Stores For these blades And dont always last the year so far the Blades work good And the price is good too will recommend too others
3,philips norelco replacement head hq6,"I am currently oversea and I moving a lot... I would like to cancel the product even though it is okay and good for me to replace it every six months or a year because I might cancel my bank account and stay there for a while,, I won't be back the USA maybe for a long time; therefore, I might not receive it whenever you send the item to my address. Please let me know.. Thanks."
3,regular user,I wish these blades lasted longer than they do now compared with 15 years ago. As you can see I am a real long term user.
3,Not much to say about these...,They're razor heads. Personally I would suggest just saving your money for a new Quadra Razor...After I bought these I saw that I probably could have just paid an additional 20 bucks and got a new self cleaning model. Oh well.
2,Beware: Bezel not included!,"These new shaver heads replaced 2.5-year-old heads that were not shaving well anymore. The new heads do shave me closer and smoother, but the difference is not nearly as great as I expected. Even worse, the box contains only the actual shaver heads (foils and blades), and does not include the surrounding bezel (the plastic part that holds the three heads and itself flexes) -- even though the picture on the box and on the Web site shows the heads in the bezel. This was especially disappointing because my bezel broke after a year of use, and the local distributor refused to replace it under the 2-year warranty. I had to improvise a repair myself. This product should not be displayed and represented as including the bezel."
3,Norelco Replacement Blades,Product worked just fine. This small item came in a box too big for my mailbox. Save the box and plastic bubble stuffing and think more about saving the planet.
4,Norelco Tripleheader Replacement Heads 6885Xl,"Shaving with the Norelco heads has always been smooth and comfortable. No complaints there. The painful part is the high cost of replacing the heads. I recall paying about $20 in Walmart for my first replacement, but now they are $30. I've had the razor, Norelco model 6885Xl, for a very long time. It still works well, despite the covering of the on/off button wearing away and lately I notice the total time after recharging has declined, indicating that the rechargeable batteries may be reaching the end of their lifetime. Time for a new razor at that point and maybe one that requires less expense to maintain."
2,Norelco HQ6 Quadra,"I have had several Norelco razors over the years. This is the worst norelco razor I've had yet. It is very difficult to get a close shave. If you have more than a 2 or 3 day growth, the blades grab the wiskers and pull them, instead of cutting them. This even happened when the blades were new."
2,disappointed,"I bought a new Norelco razor in March and was happy for a while, but it soon was no better than my 5 year old Norelco (which I fortunatly kept). I got these replcement blades and they were great for a while, but soon were no better than the old ones. Next time, I'm switching brands!"
4,HQ6 replacement heads are easy,"It's so easy to maintain my Norelco electric razor this way.The new heads made a definite difference in ease of shaving.However, after a few weeks, it mostly seems just the sameold routine anyway."
5,Perfectly Happy,"My husband was complaining that his Norelco electric shaver was pulling rather than cutting hair. After a quick web search I found the heads could be replaced for about 30 dollars, so I found the heads on Amazon and ordered it for his razor. My husband is not a ""package directions"" reader so when he opened the box, took off and with in a few minutes was shaving and saying how great this was, I was amazed. Very easy to change out these heads!"
5,What a difference,It's like a new razor again with these blades. No redness or irritation anymore. I was thinking about buying a new razor. I'm glad I tried new blades first!
5,"Easy, Fast and Effective","In less than a minute I was back up and running. The shave was back to being closer than before. I don't know about the claim that it is x% closer shave. I also don't buy the ""must change every 6 months"" as I hadn't changed my blade in 2 years! The blades are very well made and the old head was shaving fine."
5,Great way to buy our shaver head replacement!,"This package of shaver heads was exactly the same one we've been buying at stores but less expensive! It came soon after we ordered it, and was in great shape."
4,razor heads,product works as designed. once i found the correct part number the order was placed and came in when promised.
5,Shaver head renewal,"The new blades for the shaver renewed my Norelco to ""like new "" condition. Product is great---a new life for an aging shaver.."
5,Cuts like a hot knife through butter,"I have a super thick beard with very coarse hair. These new heads revolutionized my shaving experience. Shaving went from painful and subsequent razor bumps on my neck to super close, painless shave, and no more razor bumps.The heads were easy to replace. This choice is an environmentally and fiscally responsible choice vs buying a new shaver."
3,it is what it is,"Works just fine, costs too much. I don't like throwing out razors and try to use them until they are in really bad shape. Replacing the blades instead of throwing the whole unit in the trash for a new one is more ecologically sound, but these blade refills, even on sale, cost almost as much as a cheap shaver."
2,Replacement blades for a Norelco lift-and-cut electric razor.,"Package of blades arrived in perfect condition, delivered in timely fashion. However, the blades act like they were reused or something. They do not shave me as closely as when I bought the razor new. The performance was clearly no better than the several-year-old blades I replaced. I am very disappointed at the quality. I am led to wonder if they were rip-offs."
3,Norelco HQ6 replacement head,"My shaver is several years old. I was having trouble locating replacement heads locallyso I checked Amazon. I found an ad for them that said there was only 1 available. The pricewas about half what I had paid before.When I received them, however, the package had been opened and the heads were loose.Two problems with this:- The manufacturer states that the heads and cutters are a matched set and shouldbe kept together. The opened package made me doubt this.- I was skeptical whether they were really new.If this had not been the last one available I would have contacted the vendor for a replacement."
2,replacement heads,ASIN:B0009MFUPO Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads]]this product was sent with less user information than i needed and had 3 metallic strips which were unusable with the heads in my view
5,Ted,Well worth the money. Made my old saver like new again. Will buy two more for my sons and for me again next year.
4,Replacement head,Very good product. I would recommend it to others who use the Norelco electric razor and want to buy online
5,Easy to use,The heads are priced right and easy to put on the shaver. My husband was very pleased at my thriftiness.
5,Nice improvement,"Blades are shaving closer than the previous blade set. Hopefully, these replacement blades wlll last longer than the previous ones that I purchased. I wish the blades were not so expensive."
5,Works as expected,"Good price, took a bit longer than expected to receive but the price was worth the wait."
4,Ahhh Fresh Blades!,"My old blades were about two years old and these blades made my electric like new! Minus the battery which also needs replacing...If your shaver is slacking, you need new blades..."
3,Norelco HQ6 Quadra,These cutters do a fine job for a quick shave. They do not perform as well as a wet shaver for a close shave.
2,Declining quality over the years,"I bought my electric shaver in 2002. The shaver I love, but the blades are starting the bug me. I bought the shaver because I went to a shaved head and my old shaver couldn't cut it. (sorry, bad pun) For a number of years I found that a blade set would last 12 months before needing replacement. Then they only lasted 6 months. Now I find I need to replace them every 3 months. I doubt my hair and whiskers are getting more abrasive. That must mean that the blades are being made of poor quality materials. Whether this is as a result of a company that doesn't care about product quality, or the result of intentionally reducing the quality to increase revenue, I don't know. I do know that once you buy their shaver you are trapped into buying their blades.For anybody reading this review, you're probably already too late as this is for the blades and not the shaver. But keep in mind the long term costs of buying a Norelco / Philips shaver."
5,WAAAAAAY TOO MUCH PACKAGING !,"Received the package in about a week, not too bad FOR ""SNAIL MAIL"" since ordered around X-Mas season, package left KY and arrived in VT near the canadian border.C'mon AMAZON , waaaaaaay too much packaging, the parcel (a corrugated cardboard box) measures 3"" x 7"" x 10"", the actual product is in a box measuring 3 1/2"" x 3 3/4"" x 1 1/4"" (the green box you see in this ad) IF YOU DO THE MATH, YOU COULD FIT 12 GREEN BOXES IN THE CARDBOARD BOX ! the product itself (3 blades) is in turn in a sealed clear blister pack measuring 3 1/2"" x 3 3/4"" x 1/4"". IF YOU DO THE MATH AGAIN , YOU COULD FIT 64 BLISTER PACKS IN THE SAME CARDBOARD BOX ! Seems to me a ""bubble"" envelope about 4"" x 8"" would have done the same job with much less stuff to put in the recycling bin ! I forgot, the green box was wrapped around by 4 giant bubbles (bubble wrap)too.Have not tried the product so far, but lots of reviews already here, wont make much difference."
1,Still Awaiting to Receive it!,I order this item more than a month ago and I am still awaiting to receive it!!
1,Shaver head,Please be aware before ordering. I ordered a replacement head. All I got were replacement blades which were not needed. The release button on the head is broken. The photos show and say replacement head. These are replacement blades. It is false advertising. I hope they don't do that with other products.
1,review of Norelco razor replacement blades,the replacement blades don't fit my razor. Confusing terminology and use of terms means you can easily buy a set of blades that don't fit. My razor is a HQ6 Hydra Action triple head razor . . . it just happens to be a model that these blades do not work with. Buyer beware
4,A Clean Shave,"For months I had been searching for Norelco replacement heads, and I found them on Amazon. Delivery was quick. The shave: It took about two seconds to see how dull my old blades had become. Now that I know where to get replacements, I will do so annually.David"
4,Make your shaver like new again!,"These heads and a replacement battery transformed my almost 10-year-old 6885XL into a brand new shaver. I'm not an every day shaver, so I tend to get more life out of a blade than many folks. But shaving had become uncomfortable lately, as if the hair was being pulled instead of cut. This replacement set took care of that."
1,Received inside item as USED and OPENED,"AMAZON had item shipped from a secondary supplier. Shipping box was perfect. Inside container had glue from store price tag still on it after price had been removed. The inside plastic container that holds the Screens/Heads in place had been opened loose and mixed up.Could have been old/used ones, who knows. As this is a health issue, Amazon should contact the FDA. This is what happens when a LARGE COMPANY is TOO BIG."
5,Excellent replacement the same as original,These replacement heads are the same as the original and were very easy to install and work great. The razor is just like new again.
3,Nice to be Able to Renew My Razor,"The title says it all, but my memory of the razor when it was new remains ""better"".Perhaps a new razor (with a ""fresh"" motor) would be a better choice after five+ years"
4,New life for an old shaver,"Old Norelco is much better than a new one. Research discovered the old one has TWO AA-sized NiCads. Low-end models only have one. More power means the heads spin faster. Battery store replaced them for $20. Replaced the heads, HQ6 which are hard to find. Shaver is as good as new for less than a new high-end shaver. Don't buy a cheap shaver, invest in a good one and spend a little on keeping it in good running order."
5,excellent as expected,"This was exactly what I was looking for, in terms of replacement heads. They work great, and I am very happy."
4,replacement heads,I did not notice the big change in performance I was kind of hoping for but at the same time there were no problems.
3,Shaver replacement head purchase.,"Seems like all replacement heads are too expensive. But even at that, these heads made my shaver cut like new. Overall a good purchase."
1,Cool skin blade replacements,"The blades sent to me do not fit my razor. The part number is correct, but the way the circular blades are made they do not fit onto the spindles that project from the razor. Hence they are unusable."
5,Great heads for an old razor,Amazon has the best price on these heads for my old 5715X Norelco. I use the razor dry and replace the heads once a year. It's next to impossible to find them in stores where I live. Kinney drugs is the only one that sells them and they are $39.99. Recommend getting them here to anyone.
5,Norelco Shaver Head,"The item I purchased was difficult to find locally. Finally, out of desperation, I called Phillips/Norelco for help. They put me on hold and found what I needed at Amazon. And, the price was cheaper than the store retail price."
5,Great Book on Creation Theology,"If you are looking for a good read on creation theology, this is a great, easy read as an introduction to the theology."
3,Spirit Without Theology,"I obtained this book with the hope that it was a melding of New Age/Neo-Pagan spirituality with a solid alternative Christian theology. What I found was the same old New Age spirutality written in Christian language. I believe that Fox has many valid points, but it becomes mired in his socio-political message and overly passive writing style.This book still is worth reading if you are interested in a new version of Christianity. It is one which helps one think and consider their own ideas. However, it appears that the target audience was a people who seek a Christian spirituality without any solid philosophy or theology."
5,A Powerful and Uplifting Book,"I read the first edition of this when I was in college and it floored me. The concept that God created us with an Original Blessing, and that this Blessing is what should carry over into our lives is compelling. It discusses deep spiritual issues, including why despair or pain are also part of that blessing. It makes SOOO much more sense than the concept that we are all stained by original sin. This book is a real mind blower, and the most captivating book I have ever read. I still can't believe the catholic church kicked this guy out."
3,Not good for quick identification,"I found this book to be for the birds. Extremely wordy and only a handful of black and white prints of birds. The format does not allow for quick and easy access to identifying bird species at a glance. It does not serve my need if I have to search through lengthy text to get information about a species that I can't identify until I see a color photo.I'm sure the author spend much time in gathering information for this book such as which birds are found in what areas... however, unless you are an experienced bird watcher or ornithologist, this book may be difficult to follow without prior bird knowledge."
4,Dee-Dee Ramone Rap? Well..,This album by punk superstar Dee-Dee Ramone has got to be one of the trippiest rap albums ever. The thing is Dee-Dee is rapping about mashed potatos and mermaids. The best song on this album Baby Doll is an awsome power balad though. I am a huge Ramones fan and Dee-Dee fan so i cut him some slack if you love The Ramones i sugest buying this just to here dee-dee rap n sound silly if u dont like um then i sugest not buying this.
4,Easy wipe off,The snow removal broom is a great tool. It's easy to extend and shorten. Works well enough on even dense snow. Worth the money.
2,Too much for too little.,The scraper is plastic and poor quality. A heavy rubber would have been more efficient. You will have to exert twice the energy to remove a small amount of snow or ice. I don't recommend this product.
3,snowbroom,I received the snowbroom in very good condition and in a timely matter.The only problem was I ordered 2 and only got one. But I was given a refund for the second one. I haven't used it yet. But I like the fact that it has an extendable handle so it is going to be much easier to reach the middle of the roof and windows. I do think that the bristles could of been a bit stronger. All in all this as a great snowbroom. I hope that I get to use it soon and that it works well. SJR
3,Snow Brush,I have had two of these so far. Both broke where the threaded plastic piece connects the Al tube to the head.I replaced the broken part with a hardwood dowel and held it with epoxy and screws.I wish they could have done a better job with the product engineering.This is the best tool I have for removing snow from my car but need to use a plastic scraper for the ice.
3,"OK, but needs wider broom","The broom extends so I can reach anywhere on my truck, but the broom is too narrow to move much snow. A wider broom would be great. This is better than nothing away from home, but I'll just use a broom at home."
2,Bonus,"The only reason for a two star is because it's human nature to look at the worst reviews first. This is a GREAT product for frizzy naturally curly dry hair when coupled with the conditioner. It detangles long hair and gives it shine and body. The bonus is that i was not charged shipping and handling when i ordered shampoo and conditioner together. Maybe a mistake, or perhaps the vendor provides free shipping for orders over $50."
5,Great,"Thus is the only shampoo that works for my son's hair. He likes to keep it long. He is interracial, and sometimes this is challenging. This is a good product line for his hair."
5,Great shampoo at a great price,"I say its a great price because at this size it last me about 4 or more months. It very viscous compared to other shampoos I've tried making a fair amount go sufficient. I have really dry hair that isn't easily managed and have used countless shampoos to try to tame the beast. The usual result is having hair that feels like straw and looks dead. Redken Smooth Down keeps my hair looking healthy, soft, and smooth (as much as possible for my hair type). I recommend that if you get this shampoo also get the conditioner but in a smaller size, 8.5 FL oz. I use the conditioner with it about twice a week and that lasts me up to 2 of these shampoo bottles. The price on Amazon is probably about as good as you'll get anywhere. I hope this review helps people with thick and coarse hair out, this is the product for you, trust me."
5,"Great for Frizzy, Unruly ""big' Hair","I have what is called ""big hair"". It is long, thick, coarse and healthy. However, it is also frizzy and unruly. A friend of mine who is a beautician recommended this shampoo and I love it. It makes my hair feel like silk. It does not change the basic problems that my hair has, but it makes my hair possible to work with. I use the 'Smooth Down' conditioner along withBiosilk Silk Therapy Serum, Packaging May Vary, 5.64 Ouncesor my Redken leave-in conditioner and I feel like my hair is beautiful. These are the best products I have used."
1,enhance what?,"this product did not do anything at all. i tried it about six times and did not feel any ""enhancement"" at all. it is basically crap. maybe they need to do some more work on that formula!!!"
1,Buy Cialis or Viagra Instead,"First time I tried it with two pills, it caused me to vomit. After the first usage, trying one pill at a time was better, but it seems the results are not as predictable and rewarding as they are using Cialis or Viagra. I WOULD NOT BUY IT A SECOND TIME!"
2,World Strongest,I am still waiting for this product to show some signs of activity. It just seems like sweet candy.
2,Too much info for novice,"As an amateur, I was looking for something a little easier to digest. I have found that this is a remarkable book with tons of information, however, it is geared to the ""amateur"" who has been doing it for ten years, not someone relatively new to backyard astronomy. Let me play around for a few more years and then I will give it addiditonal stars!"
5,A constant companion,"I read the reviews here and decided to see for myself. This altas is the best. I looked through many star guides to find one like this one. They are either too simple, too small, too large, or too nice to use in the field. This book is in my left hand, my flashlight in my mouth, and my right hand focusing my eyepiece. It definately helped me get through the Virgo cluster in under three hours. This thin volume is has great value."
1,not for soemone having database background,I did not get much out of it. I wish I did not waste the money on it. It was 125 pages of very basic information with some big font that I can get off the web. I read it in 2 hours. A very unhappy customer.
4,"Death By Stereo, My New Favorite Band","Death By Stereo is simply the most talented band of all time. While in my opinion Day of The Death was better, their material is still incredible. From the nonstop fast-paced drums, to the energy-packed vocals, and the technical guitar parts, there is no reason why you shouldnt have this cd. Get your car keys right now, and go buy this cd."
5,Fabulous Work -But Beware,"I own 5 vinyl copies of this album. It remains my favorite piece of music ever and I bought the CD reissue last week. As to it's legality, I can only say that the second half of the album appears to have been mastered from vinyl. That is not normal for a legal sanctioned work."
5,Outstanding,"Like an earlier reviewer, I own several copies of this album on vinyl. The songwriting and performance is unique and absolutely stunning. One of my favorites since I first heard it in '71. I also had the great pleasure of hearing Fraser and DeBolt live in 1972 in a small concert club. I'd love a copy on CD but I'll honor the wishes of Ms. Fraser and not purchase a bootleg. I can't understand why some label like Stoney Plain doesn't do a proper reissue."
4,improving lp,better sound than some of their previous material.Less screechnoise and clearer vocals. a big step up.
4,The quintessential lace history,"Levey's book is considered today's bible on lace history. Chapters are organized by time period; the chapters are then organized by country or lace type. Economics and international relations are included along with lace development and a nod to fashion. Clear and numerous images. Caution: The writing is very dense and complicated; it can be hard to follow if you don't already have a foundation in lace history. Also, most images referenced are in a collection at the back of the book, necessitating flipping back and forth."
3,Not what I expected,The instructions came in German and we had to rely on photos in the booklet to put this onto the bicycle. It states that it holds up to 50 lbs but my 40 lb son isn't stable on it. It shifts side to side and seems to be weighed down almost to the tire once he sits on it. We did take it and the bicycle to a bike shop to make sure it was installed correctly and it was. Just not sturdy in my opinion.
4,Finally a Child Seat that Fits,"I had purchased two child bicycle seats before this one, just to find out they would not work due to an unusual mountain bike frame on my bike. After doing some reseach online it looked like the Kettler seats would be the only kind that might work. Thankfully it does, though it took a good hour or more for my husband to get it on for me. My only complaint is that I can not ride with my peddle cages, if I do my heels hit the foot rests on the seat. Other than that, I'm happy to have something to plop my 22 month old on and just go (we have a trailer, but I hate having to put it together everytime I want to take a quick ride). The seat is so easy to put on and remove when I hang my bike up while I'm not riding, or if I'm not taking him. I think he prefers to go in the trailer, but he's starting to get used to the seat."
2,Cookson is alwaus good,love Cookson but this was not her best for sure but O.K. if you love Cookson read it--love her anytime
5,Cookson,When I read Cookson's books - it so reminds me of my time spent with my coalminer relatives in Geordie land. They were very poor but had such a survivor attitude.
5,We read it until it fell apart!,"I purchased this book in 1999 for my then 4-year old daughter. The collections of stories are wonderfully entertaining. From Faeries and Giants to Goblins, Witches, Gnomes and Monsters, the tales are perfect for young imaginations. Nothing scarey or inappropriate. The authors are English, so I always read with a British accent which made things more entertaining. Two daughters later, and all three still read the stories! We've read every story countless times, and they're still special. Where else can you learn what the Tooth Faery does with children's teeth or that Goblin's love custard! I must confess, I love the stories too! Buy the hardback version if you can find one. My paperback has been read to bits......but isn't that what every book dreams of? ;-)"
4,A very good fun album,"This cd is the best of all of Deborah Harry's solo cd's. It's fun, bright, and reminds me alot of Blondie, but being different than Blondie.""Comc Books"" is a fast paced loud song that really cracks!""Brite Side"" is a cool ballad. This version is a different version than when Debbie sang it on ""WiseGuy"" but it is still good.""He Is So"" is similar to Heart's ""There's the Girl"" Eqaully as engaging and eaqually addictiveThis cd is worth your $$$"
4,Deborah Harry's wink to Blondie,"Deborah's third solo album is mainly produced by the Blondie hitproducer Mike Chapman.Def,Dumb & Blonde is, among most Debbie/Blondie fans' her most liked solo album. I think it's because it comes so close to the Blondie sound.The album contains 15 tracks and (allmost)all are very well done. Three very beautifull ballads: ,""Briteside"",""Calmarie"" and ""nd of the run"" Edgy punk songs like ""Bike Boy"", ""Forced to live"", ""Comic Books"" and ""Bug Eye"" which make this album a must!!!The popsingles ""I want that man"" (UK top 20),and ""Maybe for sure"" could have been Blondie hits , ""Get your way"" is a very catchy rapsong a la ""Rapture"" and ""Sweet and low"" a dance track which invites you to dance.The only reason why I don't rate this album with 5 stars is because of the annoying ""I'll never fall in love"" I think that song is one of Debbie's worst songs."
5,This book made me ache for another visit to the Vineyard.,"The author captures the very essence of the Cape Cod shores and the Vineyard and Nantucket. And the charming illustrations add to the call of life at another pace and that life can truly be enjoyed, one B & B at a time."
2,Norelco Reflex Shaver,"I am not completely satisfied with the product. It needs some skills to get used to it. High chances of brusing your skin. Yet, Norelco is a great company for shavers."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought one of these last summer and it didn't work (threw out the box so I couldn't return it). Bought another one last week figuring the 1st one was defective and it didn't either. It should have tipped me off that I had to wade through 6 reduced price ""opened box"" items before finding a new one.The specifics: It attracts bugs very well, but doesn't kill them. I even tested it by allowing my garage to fill with mosquitoes and leaving the unit on all night in the middle of the floor. I received several bites in the morning while inspecting the floor below the unit---only to find that NOT A SINGLE INSECT HAD BEEN FRIED! Do not buy this product."
1,Poor Performance,"This thing simply does not work. Bugs fly to it, around it, and sit on it.But none are killed, or kept away."
1,Kaz Inc/ Stinger does absolutely nothing.,"On this site it's called the Kaz Inc but at some other stores it's just called the Stinger.Does not work. At. All.I agree with the other review where he left it inside his garage overnight and it didn't kill anything. I have a garage full of bugs and flies, so I left it in there overnight - three nights in a row - and it didn't kill anything. Nothing. I moved it from the back of the garage to the middle and even placed it on top of an old refrigerator.Nothing.It's going back. It's worthless.Amazon: Why can't we give zero stars when something isn't working at all???"
3,"Attracts some bugs, not pantry moths","When I received this product, I noticed that some of the coils inside were bent against each other, probably from shipping. This bridged the circuit and created a short circuit which means all it would of done is wasted electricity, doing nothing to a bug if it landed on it. The way it works is a bug has to touch two of the wire coils (which are very thin and close together) to send electricity through the bug and fry it. If two of the coils are touching each other, the electricity just goes straight from coil to coil instead of through a bug that might touch it.Some of you saying that it doesn't work might want to inspect the coils. If they are landing on it, and the bugs are not getting zapped, then more than likely there is a short circuit somewhere.I have had moderate success in it attracting bugs. Pantry moths, however, seem to avoid it like the plague which is a shame as it was the main reason I purchased it."
4,"It works, plain and simple",Not sure why so many reviews are negative. Got this last year and heard it zapping away. Just replaced the bulb last night and this morning there were dozens of dead insects on the ground below.My only gripe is in agreement with one other - the cord is a bit too short.
1,Fairly worthless,"As previously indicated, it does not do a good job of attracting insects (including the use of the so-called mosquito lure). On top of this insult, the bulb lasted about 2 months. At $17.30 for the replacement, this company would do a fine business....if their product worked at all. Into the trash it goes. I would not even give to Goodwill or Habitat!"
4,Forgotten melodic prog classic,"This is one of the finest forgotten prog albums of the 70's, Wigwam as its best. More progressive than later Wigwam albums and more understandable than ""Being"". It has truly beautiful prog songs and last song is cool prog version of Sibelius classic ""Finlandia""."
3,Nice tv but.........,I have one of these televisions and after two years a convergence thingie went out on it. Looked like you were seeing everything in double-vision. Luckily I had an extended warranty on it as it would have cost 600.00 to fix it. They had it about a week. It does have a great picture but I am afraid JVC will not be getting anymore of my money in the future. I also had a JVC stereo receiver that went out in five years. Every other stereo receiver I have had in my life I had to give it away. Apparently none of the letters in JVC stand for dependability
5,Great bargain,"I have had my set since November 2003, one of the best deals on the market for a projection HDTV monitor. No troubles out of this set, excellent picture, lots of features and inputs."
1,Broke on the first use,"Was using for the first time to pump up a BIKE tire, and the framework is so cheap and flimsy that it started to buckle and I kept having to bend it back to resume pumping. It eventually broke before I could inflate one tire. Note that I was using it correctly because I had an identical design, but older version of this pump for years and years. This one is an example of reaching the lower design limits for usability."
1,Broke on 2nd use,"The plastic piece below the valve broke off. Irreparable and I'd only had it for 40 days. Really, really cheaply constructed. Look at the other reviews. Way too many complaints about breakage."
1,cheap. won't last.,"This pump didn't last a year. Like another reviewer, it broke near the valve at the base of the hose. And it wasn't mistreated. It's just a cheap product. Don't bother wasting your money on this."
2,Disappointed,"For the little while it worked. The gauge is hard to read, and the plastic thumb-lock does not work well. Not recommended."
2,not too happy!,I bought this to use on my golf cart tires. Two were low so I tried to pump them up. I did get enough air in them to go down the street but I will only use this if I have too. very easy to use but it takes a very long time.I could never pump up a car tire with it. Debating if I want to keep it. Price was right...
1,Poorly constructed and a waste of money,I bought this pump to replace an old bicycle pump I had thinking it would be easier to apply air pressure. The pump was flimsy and the hose broke right near the piece that you connect to the valve last week. Waste of time and money.
1,"Cheaply made, broke quickly","This foot pump broke within 3 weeks of getting it. The plastic where the hose attaches to the body of the pump cracked and split. We wrapped it in tape and got a few more uses out of it, then it split some more.I guess we got what we paid for. I'm buying a more expensive and hopefully better quality pump now."
2,"Nice, but didn't last long","It's cheap, effective and easy to use, but mine didn't last more than half a dozen uses before the air-hose broke just below the valve."
2,It died before inflating 1st tire,"Like many people looking for this product, I had an older one that worked great. I just can't find it anymore, so I'm looking for a replacement.This one seemed to have a short chamber; pushing a small quantity of air with each push (I might be wrong).I started inflating the front tire on my bicycle. Before the tire could be called inflated (it was still soft) the pump made a puff noise and stopped working. It is now very easy to push and it is not pumping anything. Somehow the piston failed.I'll open it to see what went wrong, but until then I could speculate that actually there might have been an obstruction in the pump's house that restricted the output of air, or the pump is so fragile, it cannot take the punishment of inflating tires."
4,Back to Philadelphia,"Todd Rundgren went back to his hometown and went for the sound of Philadelphia on ""Nearly Human."" There's a delightful abundance of Philly White Guy Soul spread across this poppy return to form, as he decided to eschew the gimmicks and just have his band record the album live in the studio. This resulted in two of his best late 80's songs, ""The Want of a Nail"" with Bobby Womack and the ballad of despairing ""Parallel Lines.""His sense of fun is also back, as his spry cover of Elvis Costello's ""Two Little Hitlers"" indicates. The Tubes join him for a rocking number called ""Feel It"" (both Prairie Prince and the late Vince Welnick eventually joined Todd in a few of his touring bands). And finally, there's the stunning ""Hawking."" Todd sings his heart out on one of his most soulful ballads. As usual, ""Nearly Human"" shares many of the delights of knowing you're not always going to get a standardized album when Rundgren decides to let one out. This remains one of his better 80's albums."
5,todd-nearly human,"any todd rundgren fan will love this album ! there are at least 2 of his all time greatest songs from this true musician who has been on the radio for about 40 years ! any musician will appreciate the complexity of his music and the talent he chose for this album which is so absent from much of todays music. nearly human covers a broad range of styles that would be hard to categorize into one particular thing. great voice, great music. if you have the chance to see him live, you should do it !"
4,Great Music Poor Sound,The music on this album is first rate. For me this is some of the greatest Rundgren stuff out there. Unfortunately the sound quality is pretty mediocre - certainly not the quality of what late 1980's studio technology could deliver.
5,Best Todd,This album was recorded live in the studio. The band is great. Parallel Lines is maybe my favorite Todd song. To think this album is out of print is a shame.
5,This Album's a Killer,this is nearly as good as last year's 'passing ships' and makes a perfect companion piece (recorded in 1968 vis-a-vis 1969 for 'passing ships'). it features the consistently superb front line of chuck tolliver and joe farrell and the ever-snappy billy higgins on skins. andrew hill simply sounds like no one else. he is one of the unheralded masters of the last 40 years. this cd marks hill's place in the pantheon of all-time post-bop greats.not to be missed.p.s. this album also features a track called 'black sabbath'! :)
3,Does Barnhart resent Graham?,"Overall, a thoughtful criticism of Billy Graham's ""religion."" I can't say I walked away from the book with a profound understanding of Graham, but I did walk away from it with a new curiosity for Graham, which might be the point. He is full of interesting insights, such as the fact that Graham doesn't speak Greek or Hebrew. I recommend at least checking the book out at the library... it's a short, easy to follow book that will make you the life of a dinner party. Do read it also in its German format ""DIE BILLY GRAHAM STORY."" Seeing these two books back to back is quite a trip, yo."
1,not enough melvins,"no, this isn't all melvins, just the one song off of their honky album. the rest can't be melvins because they rule! sell this and buy houdini or stag or maggot or ozma or gluey by the melvins. no one can touch them."
2,"Broken in a few months, never quite accepted standard cans","I use standard Gilette cans. They were always too short. I would rig the thing with padding in the bottum to fix this, but it was always a challenge to get enough padding to work, and not too much, as to spray the contents out in seconds (yes, you can empty almost an entire can in seconds). Not, it does not really work at all. It has two functions, nothing, and spray the contents of the can out in seconds.That said, for the four months when the product worked, it was grand. I loved taking a shower and having hot lather waitng when I shaved. The product worked quickly, until it broke.Purchase with this warning, it works, but not without problems. Furthermore, is $24 a decent price for 4 months of use?"
2,Conair Hot Lather Machine,We bought 2 of these. Their life span seems to be 4-6 months. I would like to find one that would last a year or more.
3,Luke Warm,"I've wanted one of these for several years and purchased one for myself for Christmas 06,The price is good but the lather is only luke warm, not even close to hot.Guess you get what you pay for."
3,The Best Shave ever.,This is a very good machine. I have never enjoyed a better shave since buying this product.
1,Horrible do not buy,All conairs hot lather machines are a scam. be ware you are not going to get the barber's nice hot lather. You will get luke warm lather very thin in nature. The machine will fail in very short amount of time
1,HORIBLE BUY!!!!!,"Was glad it got here then i plug it in and wait a till the next day to use it, to be sure its realy hot. But then it olny sputters out a few drops of foam ( yes I did shake the can) and the rest of it is luke warm.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS A WAIST OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I WOULDENT EVEN GIVE IT A STAR BYT THIS SITE MAKES U."
4,"first lasted 10 years, and the second is still as good.","This is the second time I got this for my hubby. The last one lasted 10 years and was still working but getting a bit grungy and the cord looked like it had better times.He loves this and uses it every morning and if in another 10 years he needs another, I am sure I will get it.One thing, it only uses certain size cans.. so be sure that it takes the shaving cream can that you use."
1,Worthless,I had an old model 10 years ago and loved it. I bought this new one and had to take it back because it did not heat up. The one I exchanged it for had the same problem. I called Conair and they told me that people complained that the older ones were too hot. Now they make them so that they don't heat up as much. This is a total waste of time. I took this one back also. This new version is worthless!
3,Good Machine aside from Electrical Problems,"Have purchased two of these in the past 3 years. Each runs as advertised, but each one has had electrical problems. I think this stems from the fact that when I am finished shaving, I wrap the cord around the base for storage. After time (about 1 1/2 years in each case), the electrical connection from wire to the guts inside gets faulty resulting in the machine not turning on. But, because the price is good, I will run out and buy another."
2,"Hot lather, for a moment","The Conair hot lather machine works fairly easily. Take a standard can of shaving cream, pop off the top and the dispensor cap, and insert and secure it into the hot lather machine. After you plug it the red light will turn on, and when the lather is 'hot' you'll see it switch over to green, which only takes a few minutes.The lather does dispense comfortably hot in your hand, but it very rapidly loses its heat. Its no exaggeration to say that by the time you put your hand to your face the lather has become tepid, and once you're ready to shave the lather is no warmer than it would have been had you dispensed it from the can directly.I'm going to store this machine until winter, when it might prove more useful. It doesn't seem to be worth the trouble right now with spring and summer coming up."
3,"OK, not the hottest foam","I was expecting the foam to be a lot hotter when I use it, right now it's just above lukewarm. Sometimes the steam that shoots out is practically scalding, while the foam doesn't come out anywhere close to that temperature. My barber has an older model Conair that seems to produce hotter foam, not sure why. But I will say that it does make for a better shave than using cold cream right out of the can."
4,LIked it so much this one was a replacement for a 5 year old one,"A little more than 5 years ago, received a similar model as a Father's Day Gift. It died. Searched brick and mortar stores for more than a month and could not find one. Was told it was a ""speciality"" item -- carried only around Christmas & Father's Day. Ordered this online. Shipped promptly and works great."
3,small investment for a nice return,"For someone who started shaving at 13 and hates to shave, I had my doubts about this unit. in fact it sat on my shelf for two months before I gave last years xmass gift a chance. Simple to use and the lather was steaming hot. I actually started to shave 2x a week just to use it. I am having issues now with having only luke warm lather. I had to shave on the road last week, and had to use lather straight from the can. I hated it. I need to try to clean out the unit and to shake it before use. If that doesn't work, I will go buy another unit. It helps make a annoying routine rather pleasureable."
4,"Very Thorough, buy this one first!","My son is 10 months old and I just got this book. I wish I had it earlier, it would have saved a lot of time spent searching for information. Takes you step-by-step to understanding what is Down Syndrome and how to embrace and prepare your child for his future."
1,Please don't buy this book first,"I was given a copy of this book when my son, Zachary was born. As another reviewer mentioned, it was quite scary reading all the things that MIGHT be wrong with him medically, along with the quotes from parents the author included. I'm sure the quotes were a well-meaning inclusion from the author - but each and every one I would review to be extremely non-descript, even bordering negative. As a parent of a child with DS - I can tell you first-hand that my experience has been nothing but non-descript...but overwhelmingly positive. My son, at less than 2 years old, has already brought so much joy into our lives and countless others. A child with Down Syndrome is a blessing in disguise. He give to me so much more than I give to him as you wil hear from just about ANY parent with a DS child - but not from the author or the outdated quotes she chooses to include in her book."
2,Don't let this be the first book for a new mom!,"When my son was born with DS, all I wanted to hear was that this was a good thing. This book was factual, yes, but it was somewhat depressing for a new mom. Reading the comments from parents was especially discouraging for my husband and me. I was searching for that joy and privilege that I had understood parents of DS kids to have... but couldn't find it. Eventually, I saw other books, calendars, videos, and talked to the self-proclaimed ""lucky"" parents whom I had sensed were out there. I just wish I had done things in the opposite order."
2,Misleading,"I am an early interventionist, working with several infants and children who have Down syndrome. I found this book to be somewhat incomplete and misleading. For example, it contains a developmental milestone chart for typically developing children. This chart caused no end of worry to the parents I work with. More accurate, Down syndrome specific information is available elsewhere."
4,Babies with Down Syndrome,This is a fantastic book for new parents or those newly involved with children with Down Syndrome. It helps to dispell negatives and impose the positives for those who have no knowledge at all.The only reason I did not give the book five stars is because some of the information relates to American systems and I live in New Zealand so much of this was irrelevant.
5,Beginning Banjo - Avram Siegel,"Beginning Banjo gives you almost 2 hours of lessons. The instructorspace was not too fast for me so you should be able to follow him prettywell. Once he plays the songs for you, he breaks it down for you intosections with explanations of his techniques. The instructor startswith the basics of Banjo playing; tuning, scales and basic chords. youalso learn techniques like rolls, hammer-ons and pull-offs. I like thebonus section the best because that has all of the lessons in a librarysort of format that you can flip through as you need to. This DVDreference library feature should be plenty to get you going consideringit was about 60-70 pages long and had many songs such as: FireballMail, Bile Them Cabbage Down, Worried Man's Blues, Liza Jane, CrippleCreek and more. I would consider the DVD well worth the price."
1,This dvd stinks,"You should get something else, this dvd was done in one take, lot's of use of the word um. There's better free lessons on youtube."
4,Beginning Banjo,I received this DVD on time and in good shape. I gave it as a gift so don't know how helpful or well done it is for instruction.
2,Not a fun read.,This book is very detailed in studying the level of organizations in the work setting. Must chapters seem like they take forever to read and get a grasp on. When I was finished reading it I found the information to be very overwhelming and hard to remember. It might be a good book solely to use as a reference. I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,Not Impressed,The animation is terrible. It was boring. I had to walk away after about 10 minutes. I like baby signing time and leap frog dvds much better.
5,"An ""Absolute Delight""!!!!!","When I read this to my children in the early seventies, it was such a delight that I went around the neighborhood and read it to all the children in the neighborhood!!! I am sooo thankful that I found it so that I can read it to my grandchildren! It reveals how our thoughts affect us. Our minds are the control center of our lives and affect us much more that we realize. Our thoughts can make us happy, or sad, mad, or stress us. Think we can, think we can't either way we're right. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR HAVING THIS BOOK!!"
5,This album kicked Thriller off the charts!,"I was only a kid when this album came out...but it was one of the first metal albums I ever listened to. The music was fun and fast...it energized my moody teenage nights.Now, as a 24 year old adult, it bring a smile to my face...saw 'em live this last summer...rocked the house!Metal Health is dated now...mostly due to the mixes being so bass-light...but the vocals, drums, and guitar really rocked the world for the times...still do.This band was always under-rated. I don't know much about DuBrow shooting off his mouth...but which metal band didn't? Motley, Guns-n-Roses...who did mouth off?remember boys and girls...some of us have been listening to this stuff for years, it's not just a nice cool ""let's get back into the 80's thing"" for us. When most of you are trying to convince us you never rocked out to this album...I will still be cranking it up!Rock 'em on the Flip Side DuBrow!"
5,Bang your head! Metal Health will drive you mad!,"To sum it up quickly this is simple, carefree, fist pumping, head banging, stereo shaking, riff making magic. It is hair metal's holy bible and packs more attitude then most of the movement combined.You need not be embarrased to have this in your collection. The head pounding riffs of Metal Health and Cum On Feel the Noize (Both of which are anthems of the metal 80s) should suit metalheads just fine. The rest of the album also has some truly golden moments as well. (After listening to it you'll think Love's a B**** too)So Cum on Feel the Noize. Even if you have a remote interest in heavy metal, this should be in your collection. In fact just for the first two songs alone a copy of this is valuable property. It simple, fun, great party music, and hair metal at its finest. Don't hesitate. Get it NOW!"
3,couple good tunes,"If you can find it in a bargain bin then the title track is certainly worth a few bucks. Overall it sounds very dated, but the title song still f'n rocks."
4,BANG YOUR HEAD TO METAL HEALTH,"WHILE THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM AND I DO REMEMBER WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT BEING 16 YEARS OLD, THE RIOT DONE A EXCELENT JOB OF COVERING SLADE'S HIT ""CUM ON FEEL THE NOIZE"" FROM 1973 AND THE OTHER SELF PENNED HIT ""METAL HEALTH"". THERE ARE SOME OTHER GREAT (WELL KNOWN) TRACKS ON HERE AS WELL ""LOVES A BITCH"" AND ""LET'S GET CRAZY"". I DO RECOMEND THIS IF YOU DON'T OWN IT BUT, TOO THE UNDERTAKER (ISN'T THERE A WRESTLER CALLED UNDERTAKER)..QUIET RIOT WHILE THEY WERE A PRETTY GOOD BAND, DOESN'T TOUCH THE STATURE OF THE MIGHTY LEPP. AND WHILE THIS ALBUM DID SELL WELL, IT BY NO MEANS OUT SOLD HYSTERIA, SO HOW'S ABOUT A BOTTLE OF WINE WITH YOUR CHEESE. ENOUGH IS SAID"
4,Great early album from the party boys of metal!,"Metal Health is a fantastic album. Featuring some of their best songs including their all time most popular hit ""Come on Feel the Noise"". In the 80's there was only one band that delivered Rock-em', Sock-em' heavy metal punch, and that was Quiet Riot. Who cares what's going on in the world, forget your troubles, and crank up Metal Health all the way to the party. The live cuts of bonus material also does the trick as it adds to the flare of digital remastering. Their follow up album 'Condition Critical' is another awesome album to have as it is also one of Quiet Riot's best including no shortage of the same On-the-floor, Out-the-door beats. Quiet Riot will not dissapoint, get this album!"
4,"The ""other"" songs are good too","I picked this up on CD recently (it was the first tape I ever bought back in Grade 8!), and it has aged pretty well, actually! Cadillac, Crazy, Breathless, and especially Run for Cover are good solid 80's metal fare, and of course the two big hits are classics, even if it's not cool to admit it. A great guilty pleasure when you're in the mood for a band with big hair!"
3,"""Cum on feel the noize"" is a Slade cover!!","""Metal health"" (1983) was the first metal album that reached no.1 on the Billboard chart, and it has sold over 6 million copies over the years. Quiet Riot haven't been able to top this triumph and as the years went by, they were pushed far away from the lime light - out of sight, out of mind? ""Metal health"" is not at all the band's best effort, but it includes the attractive title track and a great version of Slade's ""Cum on feel the noize"" (a lot of people seem to believe this is an original Quiet Riot song - check out the original). Other memorable tunes are the light rocker ""Slick black Cadillac"", the radio friendly ""Don't wanna let you go"", and the faster ""Breathless"". But all in all, this album is not outstanding, and selling over 6 million records is not necessary proof of a masterpiece. The general unconcerned public can really make your day, and Quiet Riot has their lucky star to thank for this major hit."
2,A heavy metal miss,"This Cd only had like one or 2 songs that I was really about to get into. The rest of the CD wasn't terrible but it certainly wasn't anything that effected me as most of the other bands I listed to did. Good effort, but for me it didn't really move me."
2,A band that could never last,"Singer Kevin Du Brown is a real fighter, and achieved, through pure dedication, a brief stardom with his band, Quiet Riot. But the real stuff was never present in their songs, never. I don't know if it is the musicians'fault."
2,"""Cum on Feel the Noize!!""","Look in any rock n roll directory in the world under '80's hair metal cheeze and you will find these guys on the top of the list!! Back in 1983 you could not find a radio that was not blasting out ""Cum on feel the noize!"" Feel good music, yes. So is the title track ""metal Health."" Fist pounding rock N roll. Also check out the track ""Battle Axe"" it is worth a second listen to. Other than that, pull out Van Halen's ""Fair Warning"" for something real!!"
5,Quiet Riot Rules!,"What else can I say, It's quiet Riot.Brings back memories, only its sounds better on CD, I originally had this cassette in 83.Now I have this entire CD + Condition Critical on my iPhone 4S, and on my PC.R.I.P- Randy Rhoads- Kevin DuBrow- Sheryl SussmanMetal 4 Ever..."
1,ITs BEEN 25 YEARS,"This lp should have NO STAR. Its been 25 years since quiet riot started, and to date they havent found the way to make at least ONE good song. I remember when i used to like this album,3 years ago,and now i realise what wrong i was.L.A.glam metal is the best rock:RATT,MOTLEY CRUE,POISON,GNR,L.A.GUNS,WASP,SLAUGHTER,PRETTY BOY FLOYD,BUT NOT QUIET RIOT!!!!"
2,A Just OK Curling Iron,I didn't give this product a high rating because it takes about 15 min. to heat up which is a lot in my book. When it is done with that it curls your hair but it eventually falls apart. If you touch the curls or someone else does your hair just getts frizzy and wavy. If you want curly hair you should get a perm or a more expensive curling iron but no this product. Maybe it works if your hair is naturally curly but mine isn't so it didn't work wll at all.
5,"Teachers are People, Too!","Brookfield writes in a personal tone, sharing what he has learned in 20 years of teaching adults. He suggests that college students are adults, and should be taught as such. This is the sort of book you like to read when you've had a bad day and think no one else feels like this. Brookfield makes it okay to talk about things like feelings, discouragement, inferiority, degree of student involvement, etc. For beginning students or veterans alike, this book can easily become a teacher's friend--a source of comfort, ideas, and challenges which can help you survive and grow, both personally and professionally."
4,Great Book,"I know Stephen and he is such a prolific writer in the field of Adult Education. This is a great read, written for anyone interested in teaching and improving their skills."
2,Its better than Pokemon..,"For every Spriggan, there is Anime like ""Hyper Doll"", its the law I guess. This cheap, corny series is not the worst Anime that I have seen, but it comes pretty close. Like Sailor Moon, Hyper Dolls has a similar plot line, bad jokes and poor animation quality. The ""plot"": Two girls get all powered up and beat up monsters threatening the city, *yawn*. Its like ""Legend of the Overfiend"" without the sex and graphic violence. ZZzzzzzz..Yes, it is better than Pokemon, but there are some really great Anime series out there (Outlaw Star, Cowboy Beebop) that make Hyperdolls look like the tired animated goop that it is."
3,"Good series, weak DVD","There have been many short series in Japan that don't get much respect. Thankfully, it gets sent to video so people can really appreciate them. And now this type of anime finally gets on DVD, but I am afraid that Pioneer put about as much thought into it as the producers did. Mew and Mica are kinda like Sailor Moon (minus the skirts and add the skimpy outfits). They both argue and eat too much. The humor, when compared to Sailor Moon, is a bit dry, but I love watching the battle scenes. Now here is the big let-down about this DVD. The live-action version, which was included on the second subtitled VHS tape, isn't included. And extras are no where to be seen (not much to expect from a 2 episode series). Overall, good series, great price, weak DVD."
2,Not much here,"These episodes are obviously not to be taken as a serious plot anime, but rather for their comic value. However, the comedy is pretty bland and there isn't enough of it anyway. This series is like Sailor Moon, only with a brief glimpse of breasts during the costume change phase of the heroines.The low price is deceptive since the DVD contains only the two episodes, choice of English/Japanese language and English subtitles on/off, and nothing else. NOTHING. The animation itself is fairly mediocre. They could have added something to this DVD worthy of watching more than once, but they didn't. Too bad..."
4,Sweet Angels!,"Another of Pioneer's budget DVDs, this one is worth every penny. Somewhat a parody of Dirty Pair, it's the story of Mew and Mica, two delinquent alien agents sent to protect earth, and the unfortunate boy who knows their secret. The writing is just great; Mew and Mica are the pinnacle of apathy and a great comic duo. The dubbing is exceptional and the subtitle good. Only two episodes of such quality material is a shame, but is the complete series as far as I know. My only gripe is the missing music videos and live action skits that graced the LDs and videos. I understand this was a budget DVD but the loss is felt. It's really funny, 4 stars."
1,Why watch this?,"It got some funny ideas in the conversation, but that's just not enough to make it worthy to spend one hour watching this title. These characters is not fascinating and the image quality is less than average at best. The plot? does that ever exist in this title?"
3,Not too bad,The book was what I expected. If you love Hooper and love new England it's a good book. I wish the colors were a bit better.
1,Extremely flimsy.,"Very cheaply made, flimsy and will not fit the ipod snuggly. I bought this for my daughter-in-law but should have stuck with the one I got for myself some years ago (the Griffin 8127-5GSTRLNB). The Griffin is sometimes hard to use the scroll but it fits the ipod snuggly, stays in place and fits around the arm quite secure even while running or doing errands. The CTA was a waste, save your money."
3,Not as described and overpriced,Ordered this specifically because of the brass bristles. When it arrived it had steel bristles. Was at a local Meijer store and saw a virtually identical brush with brass bristles for only $1.99.
1,Buy the Weber Brush Instead,"At the time I bought this brush it was about half the price (~$6) of the very similar Weber brush. There's a reason it's half the price, there's less than half the bristles. My Weber brush lasted about a year, this one only a few months. At the current price of $21 it's an absolute ripoff. Buy the Weber brush instead."
3,Didn't care for it - maybe its just me,I bought these and ended up returning them. The shoe is exactly as pictured. The height of the shoe was comfortable. The rhinestones on top I found to be uncomfortable for me while walking so I decided not to keep them. They are an attractive looking shoe though.
5,"British bomb demolition teams, their lives and loves.","Set during the early days of WWII in London, Brian Ash discovers a world at first frighteningly terrifing, demanding all the courage he can generate, just to survive the next UnExploded Bomb defusing. Early on during the German air attacks on England, duds and booby-trapped delayed action bombs began to liter every crowded London neighborhood. Some remain there to this day; deadly, threatening. The men of the bomb demolition squads and the women they loved gradually become acoustomed to this stressful lifestyle routine. If it were only imaginary and fiction! But it isn't! Based on this dreaded historical time during the Englanders' finest moments the viewer is at once struck with what the times were truly like. It really happened!"
5,Last Days of School,"Maggie took her four year old sister Courtenay on the bus ,so she can go to her pre-school,but Courtenay's school called home that afternoon saying Courtenay didn't attend school that day.Maggie calls the cops saying Courtenay was missing . Mike starts calling everyone they know.The detectives help them find her.Throughout the book the detectives ,Maggie ,Mike an there school try to find there little sister.The best partof the book was the suspense because everytime you stop reading you just want to keep on reading to find out what happens next. Also,the book was very realistic for the reason that everyday there are kidnapping in other places around the world .In addition, it was emotional when they didn't get information about Courtenay. For a person like me who doesnt like reading you will like this one. THE ENDING WILL SURPRISE YOU!!!!!!!!"
3,My Review,"Although, this book is designed for children, I found it pretty interesting. I think it is a good book for all ages. It is a good entertainment, if you want to read something with less violence but with a lot of suspense. I'd say it is an okay book."
2,NOT A VERY GOOD BOOK!,"I guess this wasnt the type of book for me... it was boring, not surprising, and it felt like 3 months had gone by since i started the book (took me 2 weeks to read)! If i hadn't had to read this for school I would've never finished it!"
5,Great Book!,I had read this book when I was a teenager. It was good then and good now. Very well written.
4,"Incredible Picture, Average Audio","The picture is incredible and I would give this TV the highest rating on that count. Even color and straight lines edge to edge. The flat screen is definitely worth the few extra dollars it cost.But I must be spoiled by the audio of the 4-year old Sony 27"" it replaces. This TV sounds only 7/10's as good, quite a disappointment."
1,Very disappointed!! Run from JVC and buy something else,Six months after I bought this TV I started hearing a high pitch noise that does not seem to go away. Had the service tech at my house 3 times to fix the problem and almost four months later I was told by JVC that they will have to take the TV away for further evaluation so they can duplicate this well know problem better. The support person was rude and he was not helpful. They even told me that if they DROP the TV while transporting it to the service center they will not be responsible!!! This is a very common problem with their TVs yet he has no clue how to fix this problem.I thought JVC was a good brand but I will never try another JVC again. Too much problems for just a TV
5,bammer fuel cell,"hard to get item no longer carried at Home Depot. Was back ordered, but finally arrived."
1,Bammer not worth buying,I called Porter Cable and was told that the bammer guns were discontinued because they never worked as a Porter Cable should. Porter Cable offered to replace the tool with another but made no guarantee that it would work. After complaining a bunch PC offered to replace the Bammer with any equal value product. That is why I will stick with Porter Cable tools but it will not be a Bammer.
4,not for high altitude,"this fuel cell is for use with the ""bammer"" serires nailers from porter-cable. it was designed for a maximum altitude of ""denver"", 5000 feet above sea level. at higher altitudes, there is less oxygen to fuel the combustion that drives each nail or staple in cordless guns. what this means is, after you pull the trigger to fire a nail, there is a 2 to 5 second delay while the combustion takes place and the nail is fired. this can be quite frustrating. paslode has developed high altitude fuel cell packs for their cordless guns; please tell me porter-cable is close behind, because i like their guns much better. i live in santa fe, nm, usa and the altitude is 7,000 to 7,500 feet; the santa fe ski area is at 12,000 feet."
5,Overall I must give this product 5 Stars!,"Over the years I have purchased a number of items from Amazon... Some were great, others not exactly as expected... Simply stated, this one was exactly as expected & provides exceptional daily results! It has been difficult to find a replacement blade for this older (although, high end) razor. I gave it to my father for use by his care provider (he's a paitent with altzhiemers), and 7 day a week nursing care) Amazon did in fact have it, and was shipped as scheduled!My recommendation, simply put is to buy it if needed! It's not likely you'll be disappointed. Thanks for taking time to read my review."
4,Made a 13 year old shaver work like new,"I hadn't realized how badly the old shaver was working until I replaced the blades. Shaving in a quarter the time now, and it's twice as long between charges."
4,Norelco Shaving Heads,"There is nothing special about the shaving heads, they are what they are, no more, no less."
5,Norelco Shaver Heads,Shaver is pretty old and this is the 2nd set of replacement blades. They last quite a long time. Will probably replace the blades until the shaver itself gives up.
5,NORELCO HQ-6 REPLACEMENT SHAVER HEADS,"I received the ""Norelco"" HQ-6 razor blades as described. They fit correctly and were a great improvment over my well worn blades. Thanks."
1,Wrong item,"As several other reviews have mentioned, Amazon yet again sent out the wrong item to me!!!To Amazon's credit, exchange was painless. Why not be more carefully at the first place and avoid the same mistake?"
1,Long wait,I have waited 5 days for them to ship this item out. I have sent two letters asking why the order is sitting in shipping and not being processed. If you need this soon I suggest you order it with quick shipment or they will hold it for a week.
4,Thumbs Up for Shaving Heads,The Norelco replacement head I bought through Amazon cut right through the hassle I would have had finding this item in Manhattan's labyrinth of specialty shops. Thanks Amazon and Norelco for asmooth deal.Jack G.
5,Norelco Triple Header Replacement Blade Kit,I was very pleased with the purchase. After going to many stores and finding high prices or no inventory I decided to purchase on line.Smooth shaves are back!
5,New blades gave new life to 10 year old shaver.,"It was getting more difficult each day to shave. It took longer and the shave was not very close. One of the blade sleeves broke and I was forced to buy a new set. When the new blades arrived I put them in the shaver and shaved. Just like new. A smooth, fast, effortless shave."
5,Like a new shaver!,"These new heads did the trick. Sure enough, I will be replacing them more often. I couldn't figure out why my beard seemed to be getting tougher to shave every morning. I checked out Amazon's offerings and reviews, then realized that I might just need to purchase new heads instead of a whole new shaver, and that my beard actually isn't getting any tougher :<) Anyway, it's now a close, smooth shave without the previous difficulty. I'm very happy with this product."
5,A Parent and a Doctor,"I read this book with great interest. We all try to learn from our own mistakes. In this courageous and insightful book, Julie S. Joseph outlines how she has learned from the various trials and tribulations of her life. Every reader will find this human saga enthralling. Her strength, determination, and fortitude are a lesson to us all."
1,Do not buy this over priced shaver,"There is one word to describe this shaver, CHEAP. Try to clean this shaver and the head falls off. The hinge is so cheap, it will not hold while you clean. Then the head will not go back on because the hinge has poped out of the top. You can forget about trying to fix the hinge...."
2,Lemon or defective design?,"I purchased this shaver and liked the way it shaved. However, it died just 8 months later. When I try to recharge it, the only thing that happens is that the shaver gets hotter and hotter."
1,Unfortunate experience,"The seller - finalcallauction - was 2 days tardy shipping, then shipped the wrong item. So far have only been able to get them to say they don't exchange merchandise. I have returned the item they sent. When I know if they are refunding my money I intend to go downtown and buy a shaver. Will be glad to rate it for you then if you want. I think you know what my rating of this supplier would be."
