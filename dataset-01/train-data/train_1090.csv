4,"Charger great, batteries not so much...","The title says it all. The charger is great and worth the money. But the batteries that come with it are a different story. The AA batteries don't fit in any of my devices, remotes, etc. They're too big! The AAA are fine. I haven't had any problems from them, just the AA. Overall, this is a good purchase, just don't count on using the AA rechargeable batteries that come with the charger."
4,Great product,"Compared to the standard chargers available at local box stores, that have little or none of the features of the LaCrosse, this charger is great value. It charges well, gives ample information on the battery, the charge, and everything in between. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is the ease of use is not as good as it could be. Slightly more confusing instructions than need to be, other than that, a great charger."
1,"Poor Build Quality, Inadequate Thermal Protection, Fire Hazard","This unit is poorly made and presents a fire hazard. I would not buy again.When I first plugged in the unit, screen was partially blank. Disassembled (4 exterior screws, 4 internal) to find rough plastic molding edges and loose screws, resulting in the lead to LCD not making contact. Cleaned things up, reassembled, worked OK for about twenty charge cycles. Then it melted down, literally -- the casing is distorted, and when I opened it up I found melted plastic under the push buttons. There appear to be thermistors positioned in the battery compartment, but they're clearly inadequate. And even if I felt safe using it again, it's broken, since the buttons are inoperable."
1,Serious Fire Hazard,"I bought this unit in March 2011 having read most of the reviews and comments regarding the overheating. My assumption was that the issue had been taken care of with the new adapter. Wrong! After charging beautifully for the past three months I went to retrieve some batteries, only to find the charger actually melted and built up so much heat that the batteries came apart and one was actually venting gas when I went to take them off. I had a Maha charger for over four years that finally bit the dust but never like this. I would stay far away from this defective product."
5,Excellent battery charger and renewer!,This has been the best battery charger I have ever purchased. I highly recommend it to others who need a AAA or AA charger.
2,Terrible batteries,"Bought this charger one year ago. The batteries will now not power my simple Canon A590 camera for more than one day (approximately 10 pictures). They don't hold their charge for more than a week even when not used. I know that rechargeable batteries don't hold charge for as long as regular batteries, but this is really pathetic."
3,over hyped,I read the reviews and thought I was going to buy a decent battery charger considering the hefty price. It's way too complicated. It may be fine if you have the hours to invest to read the poorly written manual. I thought this would improve the battery life in my portable electronics but it didn't. The #3 button on top is not correctly installed so the manufacturing quality is suspect. It works no better than the freebie charger I got with my rechargeable batteries.
1,Total piece of junk,"Apart from looking cool this charger really is a useless piece of junk. I cycle at night regularly and rely on rechargeables for my lights, which are high power and will drain a set of 4x2500mAh AA's in 4 hours. I look after cells - I buy quality batteries and usually run them down fully before recharging. Often I will put them in the charger and it will report two or three as being dead - I have to put them in a basic charger for 15 minutes before it will acknowledge that they're ok. After that, usually 2 cells will charge to 2700mAh with one at 1450mAh and another at 900mAh. My $15 duracell chargewr always recharges my cells fully and though it doesn't have an LCD display I trust it far more. And yes I do use discharge/recharge cycles.The 1 star is for cosmetics."
2,"Limited storage, too many repeats.","While this version for the super nintendo does have many more questions and such than the version for the original nintendo it loses its novelty fairly quickly. I really wouldn't recommend this game, as if you've played it once, you will most likely be getting many of the same puzzles as previous play throughs. It isn't very fun when you know what the answer is before any clues are given. I don't know why you want to collect this game, and that is the only reason I can think of to get it. 2 stars because of repetition, which leads to low replay value, which makes it pretty boring even when played with friends."
5,Great Table. Great Price,"We are very happy with the table. Solid, beautiful, and very, very easy to put together!"
3,Not what you're used to,"This isn't anything like the Esther stories that I'm used to. At first I was really confused because it was in another language, but once I got passed that I thought I was fine, but then I was thrown off by the fact that it was in a modern setting, with modern noises and sometimes with modern clothing like shoes, but with somewhat ancient looking clothes. At first I hated this production because I felt confused lost and upset. I was thinking, ""What happened to the Esther story? How could they do this.""But I watched the ending and that explain so! much. Once that was watch this movie makes sense. If you can make it to that part. If not watch that, then come back to the movie and you may understand why the director did what he did."
3,"If you liked Portrait-era Manson, this is for you.","This CD has the all the badly-produced charm of the pre-Portrait Manson releases. It is sonically strong, but rather vapid. Also, it's barely long enough to qualify as an EP (29 minutes) let alone a full length album. My suggestion: borrow it."
2,ed gein gonna eat you,"Gidget's contribution to the early marilyn manson image is very self evident but i don't think this album does him justice.the music is decent, nothing really special and gets interesting here and there, but the vocals are really obnoxious in a sum 41 sort of way. the lyrics are somewhat bizarre but really needs more development. He's trying to get somewhere with a message but in the end they just really come off as the penning of a teenager trying to go for that punk rock feel but it just fails. this album has a sort of novelty where your first listen you think its rather interesting but it ended up getting on my nerves when i gave it another listen two years later. Gidget was a creative individual from what i see in his interests and art but this album just really falls short; i don't know if he just sucks at lyrics or that he was holding back. but the album art is rather interesting to say the least."
2,The retail price posted is a joke - very cheap product,Misleading retail price very cheap product. It is worth may be a buck. If you want any level of protection for your iPhone 5 look else where.
2,Great product - while it lasts =/,"I have owned one of these for 2.5 years, and until this last month, it worked fabulously. The only improvement would be if it could work as a stand-alone unit. Then all of a sudden this month, it won't power on anymore. Creative won't do anything for me or the countless other customers who are having the same problem. Go to their forums and search for ""audigy 2 nx power"" and you'll see what I'm talking about.Overall I'd say its a risky investment. It will run great for a while, then die out on you and Creative won't do jack to help you."
4,"Great product, does not work with Mac OS X","I have bought this product on eBay refurbished and it is a great value for the money. You cannot find a digital decoder for under $125 on the internet right now. I wish it would work as standalone without the conection to computer, connecting the input and outputs directly, but it does not. It does the conversions in software.This product is missing drivers for Mac OS X and Creative does not plan to provide them. The usb-audio site does not support it either. So it is usable only with Windows. It does start play music in initialization phase for Mac, but then it finds out it is Mac it is talking to and stops. Strange.I gave it 4 stars because it does not advertise working with Mac, but I didn't give it 5, because it just should not actively try not to work with it. Just complying with USB audio standards would be enough to do so."
1,Stay Away!,"I had researched this product for juicing ability and power. I ended up buying this one and after using it *twice* the motor just shut off. I returned this product and waited 3 months for the replacement. I decided to try juicing carrots and celery, and after no more than 5 minutes the motor just shut itself off again. I might be able to forgive this if it was the only problem with it. If you are juicing small things, like berries, with larger vegetables/fruit the unit will get off balanced shake the top loose and damage the blade. I know I read these bad reviews and said, ""oh that won't happen to me""... but it did. I hope you choose a different juicer."
3,Strong motor ; repeated clean-ups,"Very Nice motor...... works great.... Only problem i found is after makin a certain amount of Juice.. the Inner Tray Fill's... and machine must be stopped to clean(bout2-3 min's).... Then assembled again... and restarted........ which doesnt sound like much if you are only making one glass... but say you are amkin a Pitcher of something.... you will need to do this 3-4 times.... other then that its a great Product.... If only they made it... so that it gets rid of its own , Instead of cleaning every glass and a half..... (like the other weaker juicers are)"
4,"Excelent CD, but not better than Mixtape #2","#2 had more songs, more artist and only one song that was not Hip-hop."
3,Excellent beginner tape,I found this a good start for adults afraid that learning Spanish would be too dificult for them.A good confidence builder and mildly entertaining as well. Production a bit amateurish though.
3,Simple Repetition - Cultural Setting,"Average presentation of words & phrases used around the house. Not exciting, but simple enough for children to repeat. Latin American home setting adds a cultural touch. K-3rd grade teachers might find this tape useful in the classroom."
4,From the back of the book:,"Those who prepare themselves for ministry in theological seminaries and divinity schools receive in-depth instruction in the methods of biblical study, the theological traditions of the faith, and the practical tools related to preaching pastoral care, church administration, and the like. Yet five, ten, and twenty years after graduation they will tell you that, regardless of how excellent their education was, the most important lessons about the ministry have been learned while actively engaged in it."
3,Gravity,I too would have appreciated a glossary. Also illustrations would have been very helpful along with the explainations and descriptions of the various instruments used to attempt to detect gravity.
2,takes for granted,"allowing for others comments, which i endorse; i was puzzled why there was no explanation or discussion of just why Einstein and the authors surmise there are, thoeretically speaking, gravitational waves.Other than that , its a nice little read."
5,Classic life of Wesley,"There have been many biographies written on John Wesley. I believe I am correct in saying that this one by Luke Tyerman is considered one of the best, a classic. My own copy is the sixth edition three volume set (total of 1857 pages) published by Hodder & Stoughton of London in 1890. Tyerman's approach is to cover Wesley's long life of ministry year by year chronologically. Tyerman is an admirer of Wesley and biased in his favor, but does occasionally comment upon points where he takes some issue with Wesley. Perhaps the strength of the biography is Tyerman's exhaustive knowledge of not only Wesley's life, but also of the history and various personalities of early Methodism and Methodists of Great Britain. Thus, there is much anecdotal and supporting information of not only Wesley personally, but of his associates in the early Methodist movement."
2,I found some things inappropriate,"There are some things I did not like about this show. It had a lot of Christian undertones...3 days and 3 nights (Prince Tuesday's parents will be away) (sounds like saying Jesus was in the belly of earth for 3 days and 3 nights) and a song sung by Chuck Aber Love made the trees and love made the sky love made.... sounds like you are saying ""God is Love"". While there may be nothing wrong with it if you are Christian, to others it might be offensive or at least, annoying."
4,Headset Radio function.,This radio functions well. The removal and replacement of the battery compartment cover is a bit difficult and the station tuning is a bit complex.
1,Sony SRF-HM33 headphone,"Advertised as a tv headphone in addition to am/fm,/weather, I purchased this headphone to hear tv while watching tv and using a treadmill in my home (about 10 feet away from the tv and in the same room as the tv with a direct line of sight.) There was tremendous static and almost non existent reception - the only way to get ANY tv audio reception on the headphone at all was to keep my head at an almost 90 degree angle to my body and that didn't last long! I tried the headphone with other tvs in my home and had the same results. This unit needs a better antenna and probably a second battery to have enough power to transmit tv sound. Didn't work for me and I returned it. Radio reception seemed ok although I didn't test it very much since that wasn't my reason for purchase."
2,"Inexpensive, but still not worth it","I admit it; I was drawn by the low price like a moth to the flame. I've had fairly good experiences with Sony products in the past and expected quality. Well, as the saying goes, ""One gets what one pays for.""I live in a moderately large metropolitan area and have never had many problems with reception of local FM stations until now. Unless I have the sensitivity switch set to ""Dx"" (which dramatically reduces the sterio separation and apparently increases the background ""hiss"" or S/N ratio) I can barely receive anything at all. Even using this setting, reception is marginal at best.Unless your expectations are lower than mine, I recommend that you purchase another headphone radio.One other thing--I read the review of the woman who reports to use this set to receive television signals. I have no idea what she's referring to; I don't believe Sony markets this device as anything other than an AM/FM receiver."
2,Reception problem made it unusable,"I am still in search of the perfect radio/headphone set-up for the gym. I thought this would be the answer. But the reception inside my gym was terrible. Trying to listen to NPR's Morning Edition, I got more static than anything else. If I moved my head in various directions, it would come in clearer but how annoying is that! Especially when you're trying to run on the treadmill. So back it goes. Very disappointed."
4,"good buy, but reception could be better","I use these while gardening and walking in my neighborhood, as well as while my husband is around (he doesn't like to listen to the radio).They're generally pretty good. The automatic presets work well and are easy to memorize and use without removing the headphones from your head. The built-in clock is handy, and batteries generally last for a long time. They are fairly lightweight and comfortable to wear.Minuses: the reception varies quite a bit. Near dense walls, both AM and FM will cut out temporarily; you have to move or turn your head to get reception back. FM is particularly sensitive. Close to walls, I often lose an FM station whose transmitter is less than 5 miles away.For the money, this is a solid little pair of headphones with good multiple uses."
4,Hands-Free Walkman,This is the best hands-free walkman I've found. The earphones are comfortable (I even wear earrings and they don't bother me)and they stay on your head even while trail-running. The reception for me is almost perfect; there are some spots in my neighborhood where I don't get certain stations.
4,Works Well,"Works well, digital tuning is the only way to go. Comfortable on the ears but not the top of the head. Would like to see them add some type of padding."
2,Make it right or don't make it,"With the known issue of factory harness, and other fuel pump brands adding the improved pigtail and connector, Bosch should make it right or don't make it at all."
5,GREAT MOVIE POSTER,"A Great Movie Poster from the BEST BAND EVER...The BEATLES! Silly, Funny Movie with GREAT SONGS!!!! Beautifully Framed and Fast Professional Delivery!!!"
3,Justin Timberlake's Girlie Voice Ruined This Song,"""Signs"" by Snoop Dogg, Charlie Wilson and Justin Timberlake could have been a lot better. it has good lyrics but is ruined by Justin Timberlake's girlie voice. Someone else should have done the chorus. In verse 2 he asks a woman 2 questions : 1. ""You wit your friend, right?"" 2. ""She ain't trying to bring over no men right?"" Timberlake uses his girlie voice for the responses ""yeah"" and ""no"". That I can understand. Anyways, Justin Timberlake and Rap do not mix. Can you imagine what Timberlake sounds like when he has an orgasm?"
5,Enlightening,When I started to research black history I learned about myself and came to an internal understanding of what it means to be black in America. This DVD was part of that ongoing journey and was sadly valuable to watch. Looking at how horrible things were in the past make for an appreciation of the present but it also puts into context how far we have to go.
5,Mr. Depeche Mode's solo single.,"This is the first single from the lead vocalist of Depeche Mode --- Mr. Dave Gahan. This single ""Dirty Sticky Floors"" hasn't broke through on radio yet but is a huge club single. The Mixes included are by Junkie XL,The Pasengerz ,Lexicon Avenue and Silencer. The Junkie XL Vocal Mix( 10:44) is a great trance/ house mix. The Passengerz Dirty Club Vocal Mix(7:25) is the one most clubs will be playing. It is the wonderful bassline and vocals of Mr. Gahan the work best. He always sounds so good under a great house mix!!The Lexicon Avenue Vocal Mix(10:31) is similar to the Junkie XL mix but gives a harder bassline the focus. The Silencer Remix(6:38) is basically an electro style dub mix. You get 2 bonus tracks-""Stand Up""(5:28) and ""Maybe""(4:52) that are great as well. This is a great start musically for Dave Gahan ."
1,A Racist's Ramblings,"This guy is awful. He spoke at my middle school and spewed racism and lies about history. My students were bored and knew his speech was vitriolic garbage. Nice attempt to incite hatred, Ray...luckily my students have more sense than you."
1,Don't bother,"Despite my best efforts the game doesn't run and yes, my PC is compliant with the software. Rubbish QED"
4,A winner...,"Bernard Schopen again does an outstanding job of taking the reader to the Reno, Nevada of PI Jack Ross. The storyline, the twists and turns, and the depiction of the natural beauty of northern Nevada combine to create for the reader an escape to this world. Let's have another one soon, Mr. Schopen!"
5,"Furtwangler, Salzburg Festival, Live, Oh Boy!!","Herr Furtwangler ""live"" at Salzburg is wonderful listening. Opera d'Oro has done a great job releasingthese historic gems. The Fidelio of 1950 with Flagstad and Schwarzkopf and the Otello of 1951 with Vinay, Martinis and Schoffler and this Der Freischutz are super performances. Some critics about coughing aside, (it is ""live"" you know). I've been in Salzburg in summer during the Festival and in those mountains when the sun goes down, so does the temperature. But in the Festivalhaus it is shining brightly with these performances. Freischutz, even with a bit heavy-handed Hans Hopf, is brilliant with Grummer and Striech (a favorite) and all the rest of the Vienna crew are superb. Enjoy the past, share with the future. Cheers."
5,The Highlight of My Life,"The night of June 10, 2000, was the most wonderful night of my life, and I have an exciting life. The news that the concert was available on CD brought a tear to my eye. Johnny Hallyday gave the best performance of his life mixing both new music with his classic rock ballads to give the audience a remarkable evening of fireworks and magic. Buy this album now!!!"
3,Could be great,"I love good guitar, spanish guitar and similar formats. The musicians do a great job in displaying their artistic abilities. I do not mean to criticize them as artists; however, the vocals do as much to take away from the CD as the skilled playing add. The artists need to simply eliminate or at least minimize the vocals to create beautiful music to melt away to another time and space."
3,Paper Sanding Disks,"These disks seem to work OK, but their adhesive qualities are lacking and they fly off the platen when the centrifical force builds up. I tried really pressing them into place, but that doesn't seem to help."
2,Surely not Seth's best one,"Happened to read this , after a popular one by the same author , and found its presentation in stark variance to his magna opus 'The suitable boy' . Aint sure but beleive he should have written it during his student days and surely doesnt reflect the true potential of this immensely talented Indian writer . But nevertheless it's a pretty good book about those adventurous travels in Central china and their notorious beurocracy, but dont expect it be anywhere near the Bill Bryson's class."
4,an interesting read,"From Heaven Lake is Vikram Seth's first non-fiction book. First published in 1987, it tells the story of his travels through China, Sinkiang and Tibet in the summer of 1981. Seth was a graduate student at Nanjing University and decided to hitchhike home to New Delhi via Tibet and Nepal. He kept a journal during his travels, and this book is the result. With his command of the Chinese language and his garb, he was able to journey through places not usually accessible to tourists. His observations of the people, customs and modes of travel and his encounters make very interesting reading."
4,A traveler's delight,"From one who has traveled a lot, and read a lot of history of this area, this book is very down-to-earth. One can smell and feel and taste the author's movements. And that's what I liked."
3,Ok not one of his best works,"In general, I like vikram seth's works. But,I found this early travelogue to be less insightful and interesting than his later novels. I did not really connect with him, his travels, his predicaments, or the people he met along the way."
4,Unique viewpoint,"Very well done travelogue around China. A perfect counterpoint to Salzman's Iron & Silk. Salzman stayed in one spot for his sojourn in China; Seth, although he spent two years at Nanjing University, here is concerned with an impromptu hitchhiking trip through western China and Tibet. Seth isn't afraid to put some dangerous questions to his hosts and fellow travelers--questions about the cultural revolution and Red Guard, how life is now under the communists compared with before, could Tibet be a separate country once more? But the best thing about this book is Seth's viewpoint: an Indian writing about China and Tibet for an English/American audience. He takes the time to ruminate on the relations between the countries and the conditions in each country. In particular, his comparison of the living conditions of the poor and aged in China (cared for, if not greatly) and India (left destitute) was eye-opening."
4,a great vacation reading,"It was not the book I wanted to pack for my vacation reading but it was in my luggage when I got there... so there, and thanks god. It was the first book that I read by him so I could not compare to his other works. That being say, I really enjoyed this unique travelogue. In it, Seth took us on his journey, revealing the landscape, the people, the political systems, and make-ups of the ever-evolving-but-ancient china that up until now has not exposed to the outside world. I learned a great deal, and it was a story because of Seth's unique background I don't think anyone could tell it but him."
4,Pretty good,"In this price range I don't expect scientific precision--just an idea of the conditions in my orchid growing area. This nice little unit has done just that. I like the max/min feature too, but wish it were integrated with a clock feature which showed the time of day these conditions occurred.I'm back to buy another one for a different room."
2,Exceptionally inaccurate,"I bought this unit about 2 years ago from a local store and recently attempted to calibrate it and 2 other hygrometers I have in my home. Ironically, I had considered it (for no logically reason) the most accurate one to which I had been comparing the others. As it turned out, it was the most inaccurate one of the bunch. Using the salt water calibration technique in a sealed bag, all hygrometers should read 75%. One of mine read 74%, one read 62% and this one read 55% !!! Even considering this isn't the most accurate calibration it's pretty good and was reproducible when I tried it again.I'm fairly certain that another sample may well fair better I wouldn't be tempted to buy this again."
1,"Right out of the box, it started smoking when I put the batteries in!","Certainly not Amazon's fault, but this gadget was right out of the box faulty. I may be the minority here, but I put in 2 AAA batteries and immediately I smelled like smoke or burning scent. I thought it was something else so I left them in a bit. When I looked down, I saw smoke coming from the gadget. I didn't know if this thing was like gonna really catch fire so I took out the batteries. It never actually turned on. So I have to return it. Not sure if I'll replace or look for something else, probably look for another brand."
2,Its Okay....,"Ever since I got this gauge I've always been suspicious of the hygrometer function working properly. I did a test side by side with an analog temp/hygrometer gauge and found the measurements to be very different. The temperature was off by about 2 degree, no big deal, but the humidity function was off by 25+% !! Then I realized that it will not record humidity over 85%. I'm sticking with my old analog."
3,Indoor Comfort Meter Review,Nice lttle instrument. Seems to work fine and is reasonable for the price. Off axis visibility is poor. You have to be looking directly into the display to be able to read it. Other than that no objections.
1,disappointed customer,"After reading a lot of costomer reviews, I bought this item as a gift for my mother. After inserting the batteries, only parts of the digital display showed up. We tried several times to reset it and it did not work. I accidentally inserted the batteries the wrong way and it just burnt the circuit. Very cheap electronics! Save your money, don't buy this item."
1,Dead after one day,"This hygrometer acted strangely from the get-go. At first it wouldn't come on, then it flashed so quickly that had I been an epileptic I might have had a seizure. Finally it did work, but it got to a certain temp/humidity reading and never changed even though a humidifier was going in the room all night. I took it outside and set it in the sun for awhile and still nothing changed. Then I took the batteries out and put in new ones and it never would come back on. I am now waiting for a response to my email so I can get a return authorization."
1,"Embarassing For La Crosse,Weather Channel and Amazon","given this at Christmas 2009. went well for 4 months then digits disappeared ,just bars on the screen, Checked batt voltage near 1.5 but changed for new Duracells with voltage just over 1.5 same result. Tried with a newly purchased pair of Duracells,,voltage over 1.5 same resultTried new Energisers well this product does not disciminate.Tried to contact La Crosse online. the site changed once during our 4 attempts,now gives a statement that the devices need at least 1.48v. No help to the individual customer online or by phone. I suspect that La Crosse has no intention of honoring its warranty.The Weather Channel needs to rethink its involvement with La Crosse"
1,Please don't buy this,"I bought this and once I insert the battery, I felt a smoke smell. I am going to return it.I see a review here from another person stating the same issue."
4,I like my indoor comfort meter,"I got this so I could keep an eye on the humidity levels in my bedroom. In the winter time it gets very dry and I have trouble with static electricity, and a dry nose and throat. Once I started using the indoor comfort meter I could tell it was accurate. In late summer and early fall the humidity was fine and at a comfortable level. Then as the seasons began to change the humidity dropped and I was immediately notified via the comfort meter. It showed the humidity at a mere 41 percent and sometimes even lower. So once the levels dipped I started up my humidifier and everything was good. The meter showed the appropriate readings and I felt more comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to keep track of the humidity and temperature in their room."
2,WS-9410TWC - Worked for 2 Weeks,I purchased this indoor meter since I own 2 other weather meter products made by LaCrosse Technology and have been very happy with them for 5 years with no problems. This new one worked for 2 weeks and then displayed only dashes. I followed all of tech supports directions and the unit still work not work. Now LaCrosse Technology wants me to pay shipping to ship their defective product back to them. This is unacceptable. The product is not even a month old. The manufacturer (LaCrosse Technology) should pick up the tab for shipping since this product basically failed after 2 weeks of use.
3,Works well. becareful with the batteries,Nice design and seems to be fairly accurate. Biggest problem as mentioned by one of the reviewers is incorrect insertion of the batteries will fried the unit.
5,hygrometers,"I have 2 hygrometers. I like them very much, I haveforced hot air heat, which is very dry. I need tokeep the humidity up with humidifiers, and needhygrometers to tell how dry the air is and whattemperature it is. These 2 work very well."
4,overall good product,I wanted this since I didn't trust the humidity reading on my humidifier. Has large and convienent display. Due to its size and battery power I can easily move it around the house to check temp/humidity in different rooms.
2,UPSET,It is consistant in reading the temperature correctly but the humidity was also consistant in giving a reading at least 5% or more below the actual
3,Temperature is not accurate,The temperature reading is about 2.5F below the readings of all the other thermometers I have in the same room/location.I only got it for the humidity so not a real issue.I hope the humidity reading is accurate though and it does respond to changes.
3,OK But Not Consistent Unit to Unit,"I have three of these for three separate areas in the home. They are OK for getting ""ballpark"" room environment estimates. However, when I got them I set all three up together in the same room and position. All three registered different Humidity and Temperature readings! There were at least five points difference in humidity between the lowest- and highest-reading units! Temperature difference was similar. And, I have no idea which of the three is the most ""accurate"" if indeed any are even close to being so.Two areas of the home I consider ""nice to know"" but my music room is more critical. I'll have to buy a more expensive (and hopefully more accurate) unit for that room."
1,Simple - it works!,"It's all I need - plain vanilla, and it works. Don't want all the bells and whistles. I'm going to buy another one for my music room to make sure my fiddle is happy.WARNING!!! Had two - both died after about a year. New batteries won't fix it - basically a disposable product. Threw them both in the trash."
4,"Good Enough, but Not Great","I purchased 4 of these units to track temperature and humidity in a tack room, a woodshop, a boat storage garage, and a craft room that are all located in my horse barn. Each room has a thermostatically controlled electric wall heater, but the thermostats are not very accurate, therefore I am using these units to assist me with the temperature settings. I tested all four units together. The four temperature readings were within a 1 degree range; the four humidity reading were within a 1% range. The housings are thin plastic and the min/max button has to be depressed hard in order to access the min/max readings in succession. You will not be happy with these units if you intend to use them as wall instruments in your home, simply because they look and feel cheap. They are practical --- and you cannot beat the price!"
4,Good buy!,"Product as expected. I have had no problems with this lock but I have not used the mounting piece because it does not fit my bike (Trek WSD 7.3). Other than that, very satisfied with the product. Good price. Received item quickly."
4,"compact strong lock, weak mounting bracket","I have been using this lock on a 1977 Raliegh in midtown manhattan for a little over a month with no issue so far. The lock is very compact and with the larger diameter bike racks in NYC it will only fit over a seat stay and rear rim on the bike for locking (with minimal clearance. The cable ""secures"" the front wheel, but i wouldnt trust it for much more than that.Give the mounting bracket a try if your ride is slow and smooth as glass. I ejected the u-lock twice in traffic when hitting small bumps in the road (or braking) and have given up on it until i can find a way to modify it.NOTE: The less clearance in the lock, the less room to insert something to force it open. Avoid large u-locks if you are in a high theft area."
2,Broke after 10 months of use,"This lock worked well for the first 6 months until the locking mechanism started to have trouble engaging. A few months later, the lock jammed and the key broke off inside the unit. A locksmith couldn't even salvage it. Replaced it with a Kryptonite Evolution 4, which appears to have a more robust locking mechanism."
1,Lock Jams,"The lock jammed within 2 days of using it, after it rained. Now its locked outside a shop luckily a block away from my house. I'm afraid of breaking the key. I've walked to my bike on three different occasions to try to jiggle it free. I'm going to try to use motor oil to maybe loosen the pins but in short, unless you want your bike stuck somewhere, where you can't free it without looking like a thief, don't buy this lock"
2,Terrible lock enclosure,"After using this lock for only two days i accidentally dropped the lock from a foot or less off the ground only to have the whole casing for the lock come off. After trying to put it on for 15 minutes i finally gave up figuring out that the plastic holding (yes it is plastic, not rubber as you would think) the enclosure together was broken.Now i have a naked lock that is probably going to rust and have my key break off in it anytime soon. If you take off the plastic enclosure you see that all that technology that onguard claims to have is basically a cheap mastercraft lock with a plastic enclosure to conceal its true identity.Bottom line if you want a durable lock which doesn't have cheap components and might last you more than a day. For those of you who think you won't drop it, think again. You will try to lock it but the locking mechanism doesn't hold the lock and you let go (at least this is what happened to me)."
4,great lock,"I just got this Pitbull mini. I must say it is hefty. Seems pretty bullet proof. I did not have any problems with the key as others' had stated in the reviews. It did come with like 5 keys so I'm hoping not to really need them all. The one drawback and really it's just because I don't have the allen wrenches is that it doesn't come with the ones you need to mount the lock so I have to go to the store to get the tools needed to mount it but overall very happy with the quality. One thing is be careful, once it's locked there is only about 5.5 inches and that has to wrap around some part of your bike and the bicycle rack so you have to be a little creative. But great product."
3,OK to price,The lock is small and heavy. The lock it self seems to be good quality. The keys seem to be made too fine and less stable though. Other customers complain about broken keys. I could see that happen. You get 5 keys which is good though..
5,Ivan,"This item is awesome. Works like a charm. I live in sunset (San Francisco, CA). My bike is lock in the outside and has not yet been stolen. I ride with a few buddies here and there around the city and still haven't been stolen yet either. Assuming I'm lucky or else this lock is pretty sturdy. Comes with a wire chain too...now I can lock front tire, back tire, frame, and seat post. I give this item a A+++ for lock and chain combo and for keeping my bike safe and sound."
4,works well,"NO problems ... small, but goes around most posts. The bracket could be better - but works. weight is ok. I use ""pitlocks"" for the wheels and therefore only need to use the lock without cable.[...]"
3,"Great lock, but ...","I really do like this lock, but b/c of its size, it does not fit on the frame of my (women's) bike, so I have to carry it in my backpack. It's also a bit on the heavy side."
1,Great lock initially,"I purchased this lock at a bike store. I ride my bicycle 5 days a week and move it about 6 times a day (so the lock gets used 12 times a day), and I always bring my bike inside if it's going to rain. After about two weeks, I inserted the key and the lock simply would not turn. I tried using WD-40 on it with still no luck. I ended up having to get campus police to break the lock off my bike, and I ended up missing a class.Although it is sturdy and a good design, I do NOT recommend this lock at all."
1,this lock sucks,"It is a lot of pain using this lock. The metal of the keys are ""soft"", easy to be bent when rotating inside the lock for the purpose of locking and unlocking. Once they are bent, it becomes a ""tricky"" task for locking and unlocking. Typically I paid more than one minute for this process every time, and I am surprised to find every key (they give us four) has same problem. Even worse, I just got my key broken into two halves when trying to unlock it, and one half got firmly stuck inside the tiny little hole of the lock. I had to use a saw to cut the lock off to get my bike back. I feel depressed and angry. Btw, the lock itself is also hard to use.I strongly recommend nobody uses it (any more)."
2,Worked great for a year then the key got stuck,"OnGuard customer service offered a replacement but I decided to move on to Kryptonite locks. I wouldn't want to get another OnGuard lock and have my key get stuck in the cylinder again. It took me 30 mins just to unlock my bike only to have my key get stuck once opened. Never again, OnGuard.I'll give it 2 stars because it does offer great protection and it worked fine for a year. Perhaps I just got a bad lock but I wouldn't risk it again."
1,"Great paperweight, Garbage lock!","This lock would be great if the key didn't snap off or permanently jam itself into the mechanism. (Other than the fact that the bracket attachment is a completely worthless black plastic piece of trash. UNFORTUNATELY, the key does snap off and or jam irreversibly with literally almost zero effort on behalf of the user.Thank God I was able to unlock the thing with my key still jammed into the hole after trying to lock up to a tree near my apartment. I now have the option of using both pieces as paperweights for separate, lightweight, easily blown materials, or I can stick the two pieces together to hold down heavy duty things like tagboard, or perhaps a single cardboard box. If only the key could be removed, I could potentially even use this to continue securing my bike! Wouldn't that be a treat? To no avail. Thanks for nothing OnGuard. I wish nothing but bankruptcy and class action law suits on you."
4,Good except for mounting bracket,Good size and solid feel. The bracket that attached to frame is not though. Feels like itnis going to break at anytime. Figure I'll just carry it in my bag when that happens.
4,"The lock is solid, but a bit shorter than needed","The lock is solid and pretty heavy. The attachment to the bike is easy. However, I found it to be a bit short for some parking places. The wire that comes with the package is pretty handy for locking the wheels."
1,lock stuck.... lock sucks,"i've had this lock for about a year now, but only started using it regularly since cycling to work a couple times a week this month. i've used it less than 10 times, never dropped it, and kept it indoors, used in covered parking lot.the last time it actually locked, it was really finicky and gave me hell when i tried to engage the lock and then yesterday, this stupid lock got stuck. key goes in and turns lock/unlock but once i try to connect the u part to the lock- the key gets stuck! i can't turn the key (engage lock) nor pull the key out unless i remove the u part.no amount of wd40 to all ports engages the lock to actually perform is intended funtion- lock together.gonna buy a kryp like i should of in the first place:(its cute, small, hefty and looks like it will be work like a kryp..... but. it. is. a. piece. of. crap.... or now a repurposed wd40 soaked paper weight and horse shoe."
1,Fell apart after a couple of years,"So at first I had problems with the holster breaking since it was made of cheap plastic. They were not helpful at all in replacing that low cost piece.The lock itself is completely falling apart right now. Granted I purchased it in 2009 and here we are in 2011, but I would expect something that's supposed to be super sturdy and strong to last much longer than 2 years. All I can say is that the engineering, construction, and quality of the materials are all cheap. I will never buy another OnGuard product again."
4,Not exactly what I wanted,"First off, don't be mislead by my title, the lock and cable are exactly as they were advertised. The price was beautiful and the lock works seamlessly. However, I ride a fixed gear bike, and the mini lock doesn't always fit over my front tire and frame if I'm trying to lock it up. I can only get it around the frame OR the tire and around whatever I'm locking it too. The only exception is if the pole is really small. So, again, the product works great and is super strong...but I sometimes find it difficult to get my frame and tire locked up within the U together. Otherwise, this thing gets a perfect score."
1,STUCK,"I bought this two years ago and used it sparingly since I normally ride without stopping. This little bugger has worked alright, there has always been some difficulty getting it on/off. Recently, I locked my bike at work and the locking mechanism is now stuck and will not let me turn the key fully. I will have to cut this off to get my bike back."
2,A disappointment,"First off, this lock is still functional after about a year of constant use. So that's why it gets two stars. It's just that everything else is lacking:The bike mount broke after three months. Apparently you can only adjust the position once or twice, and then the mechanism strips out. Had to buy a new one of a different brand.It's about a half inch too small. I know the small size makes it stronger, but that half inch would help soooo much. I need the cable to lock my front wheel, and to lock to anything that is not a bike rack.It's begun to rust everywhere. I ride my bike in the light rain, and the inside of the lock is fully rusted. I'm surprised it still works.It's really heavy.It rattles a lot.I know many of these minuses are a fact of life for a heavy duty lock, but the rust, rattling and bike mount are just poor design."
5,Great Lock Had For a Good Price!,"This is a great lock purchased for a good price. OnGuard makes a high-quality product and has a good reputation. I have purchased their products before and have always been impressed with them. This U-style lock and cable combination is given a 4+ star rating by OnGuard making it one of their tougher locks. The U lock is of a very sturdy construction and looks the part. The quality of the lock is unquestionable. The locking mechanism used on this lock provides a high level of security as well as peace of mind.Overall, I gave this lock and cable combination 5 stars due to its security rating, quality of construction, and fit and finish."
2,Works great..................for a while,"Bought this lock about a year ago. I used it everyday until with minimal troubles until about a month ago when it would take me 5-10 turns of the key to unlock or lock the bike. Finally today, after 3 twisted/ruined keys (no wonder they give you so many) I have given up on this lock. It should not take 5 minutes to unlock/lock your bike every time!"
4,Mini U-locks are the,"I decided to get a mini U-lock because they offer better protection than their bigger counterparts. This locks works quite well besides a couple small things. I used this lock in the winter and had ice get inside the lock which obviously created an issue. I don't see there being an issue with the key breaking inside the lock unless you are over forceful with it. Also the outer plastic casing broke on me but I was a little rough with the lock. The mounting system isn't the greatest but it does the job. The cable that comes with the lock works exactly like you would expect it to. For the price, the lock and cable were was definitely worth it. I would recommend reading proper U-lock locking strategies here [...]"
1,Poor quality,"The lock itself seems sturdy enough, but its accessories are useless. The lock holder (to attach to your frame) broke after 3 rides, and the key seems fragile enough where I believe I could (and will) easily break it off within the lock; maybe that's why they give you 6 keys.Fat lot of good this lock will do me if I can't take it anywhere."
3,"Purchased, but don't use that often","This lock is fine, but it isn't that easy to with you while biking. While it does have a bike attachment, it is a bit bulky and I don't use it that much. I've had this lock over 2 years and only used a couple times."
1,i have superpowers too!!!,so i've used this lock a total of 2.5 times successfully. on the third try i was trying to lock it and it was putting up a fight. then it locked and i tried to pull the key out. the key wouldn't come out! so i unlocked it and it still wouldn't come out. i started struggling with it (gently though because i've read the other reviews) and then it happened... my key broke. i guess i'll try to contact the company but for now i'm just going to use the cable and cross my fingers that my bike won't get jacked. yeah right.
2,Mistaken,"I just got a new hitch mounted bike rack for my car. I needed a good lock to make sure that my bikes were safe when I was not with the car. I researched as many locks as I could and decided on this one. When I received the lock, I was surprised at the weight of the package. I am sure this is a very good product, but I did not want such a heavy,bulky lock as this one. Definitely a bull dog. In addition, I was surprised at the cable that came with it. Not as sturdy as the lock, for sure.I should have checked the description of the weight of the lock before ordering. I returned the lock and cable. In this case, I should have just gone to a local store to see and study bike locks first."
5,Great Resource,"What can I say, this is a must have periodical for traffic collision reconstruction. Every issue is filled with relevant peer articles."
5,Really works!,"I used these on a pair of 3.5"" heels that I would be walking in all day. I typically wear flats or low heels, so I expected to be pretty uncomfortable that day. It's a little tricky placing these in the shoe. You should try it a bunch of places before removing any of the wax paper so you don't run out of ""stickiness"" before the final placement. When it is placed properly, you don't feel it at all under your foot. But if it's just a millimeter off, it feels like a lump under your foot. Once it's finally in place, it's great! I spent about 9 hours in these shoes and probaby walked 3 miles during the day. These insoles really do take the pressure off the ball of your foot. My feet weren't even sore the next day."
2,Did not work,I followed the directions exactly and these things did NOTHING for the pain in the balls of my feet. Very disappointing. Waste of $.
2,Doesn't work.,I can't wear heels. They just plain hurt. These didn't help. They're no better than any other insole. They provide very little cushioning and don't adjust your weight to your heel as they claim to. How disappointing!
3,Ace Muck Buckets,"I liked them but horses would not drink water from them and I bought 2.I've always used Muck Buckets for water, not sure what there is about these they don't like."
3,EQ,The problem with a lot of people is that they do not get in touch with their own emotions and the causes a lot of problems later. This book will give the insight to be emotional intellegent and how does emotions work in our lives. Enjoy reading it.
3,"disqoblkqueen, mistress of real underground disco!","I also own disco spectrum vol's 1 and 2. this one is not asdeep or funky, but if you love underground disco and house,this will inch by."
4,Unforgettable!,"I first saw this movie whilst on a Rugby tour of the UK. Our Welsh host played it for us on our first night and accompanied the viewing with a full bottle of Glenfiddich! Both ""gifts"" were much enjoyed, but the pleasure of watching ""The Grand Slam"" has remained with me and my mates for over a quarter-century. Many, many laughs along with the tension of a (then) 5-Nations Rugby match, played in Paris. Don't miss it: when you can find it."
5,The best True Crime Book I've ever read!,This is the best written true crime book I've ever read! This book is filled with twists and turns. Comes Highly Recommended!
5,Wow!!!,"This is the most engaging book that I have read this year. I picked it up with very low expectations, and couldn't put the book down. Stowers writing style is very engaging. The twists and turns are remarkable. A very nice piece of research and writing."
1,Lonnie Donegan Meets Leinemann,"Just awful, would have been glad to sell it back but it was so bad I ""tossed it""!"
4,t-shirt review,"The product, being the t-shirt was fine once we finally received it. It took too long to receive it!"
2,Poor radio reception,"Like many I was looking to replace an old Walkman, but when I tried the WMFX281 I was disappointed to find that the digital radio tuner worked much more poorly than the old dial-style tuners from previous generations of Walkmen. Stations would fade in and out, and there was considerable drift of stations across the dial. For example a station with a strong signal on 96.9 FM would come through all the way over at 91 FM. The machine also feels cheap and fragile compared to older machines - but this is probably all that one can expect for the low price."
4,Great tape walkman!,"Bought this walkman in 2003 and its been working very well ever since! Yes I still use tapes, and with my new car CD Player I usually plug this walkman into the Cd deck using a audio cable and can also play tapes when I drive. Personally I would have preferred a tape walkman with reverse and auto switch abilities, but these are hard to find these days in the days of CD and Mp3 players.Besides great tape playing abilities, this walkman also has radio, TV and WB functions. My gripes are that the TV and WB modes suck! The TV mode only has a few channels and the WB can hardly be heard half the time. Perhaps its better to buy a stand alone TV tuner walkman, and WB.Overall a great 4 start product. Tapes wont die no matter what people say. I see them being sold in every single Walmart and major retail chain. Mp3 players are cute, but will only work with a modern PC. Those that own old computers or even a Mac are out of luck with everything except the ipod."
1,Eats batteries like no tommorow.,"I do not recommend this walkman, I have it and batteries only last a couple of weeks and that is when I bairly use it maybe 10 minutes every other day or something and this is using good duracell batteries. Cheaper batteries only last about a week."
1,Yikes!,"I have owned three of these because the battery life is good and I was interested in the TV feature. However, the part connecting the unit to the headphones (the green colored connector) is defective. My most recent purchase lasted only 5 months with hardly any use and no outdoor use! I contacted the company as it was under warranty and the ""repair"" would have cost more than a new unit. I am very disappointed with both Sony and this unit. I have the impression that their portable product quality has diminished over the years. For example, I have a ten year old portable CD unit that is still going strong. It's too bad, but I won't purchase any more Sony portable products."
5,sony walkman,"i had had my ole walkman for 30 years until i dropped it. this one works and sounds great, thank you."
4,not bad,sony alway cool and i got this one to replace my old one and the price was good but only thing no headphone but no big deal
3,Great in Hurricanes!,WM-FX281 Sony Cassette Walkman with Digital Tuner gets radio on only two AA batteries PLUS carries TV and weather band reception. Nice little piece of survival equipment during Hurricane Irene (2011!)
2,Would not buy,Would encourage you to look around before you buy this. Weather and TV channels did not work at all. I was only able to pick up one channel on the TV and nothing on the weather. Very dissappointed!If you need the cassette and radio - not bad!
5,Christmas Gifts,"Was on Christmas list, grandson collects Alchemist books and this is one of many that he has. He was happy to receive!"
4,cd,"Great condition. Box was a little squished but the cd's were in a perfect, unopened state. Gave it to my Mom for Christmas!"
5,Excellant Product,"This collection was everything we expected. We now have multiple copies of some of the albums, one for the house and one for the car."
4,A highly comprehensive survey,"A very well edited book that does indeed list a good number of thought-provoking books... I was a little baffled by the non-inclusiveness of the work (most of the authors listed are white males, which does not accurately reflect my personal literary tendencies). Overall a good book that I would nonethless recommend."
5,Worked Great for Me!!,"I started a reading group about 6 months ago. I started with two friends and recruited the rest of the group over the Internet. This was a great guide and probably prevented me from making a lot of mistakes. I'd never even been in a reading group, so I had no idea there was so much to consider in forming and sustaining a group. Our group is going great, we're still a bit too large, but I'm sure we'll dwindle a bit over this first year. If you're considering starting a group, I suggest reading this book to help you along. Have fun!!"
4,Solid security,"This Bulldog lock is solid as a rock and virtually bulletproof. The only drawback I noted is the clip attachment for carrying the lock on your bike: Attaching is not too easy, and the weight of the lock (good) adds to your overall bike weight (bad). I'd just leave it locked up at home base and forget the carrier..."
4,a big and secure U-lock,"I think this U-lock is more secure than most of the U-locks I have seen around campus. When my last bycicle was stolen two months ago I start to think about the methods thief use to steal bycicles and I just think we (users) sometimes are silly, we buy skiny locks to protect our stuff and they can easily be broken, we also secure the bycicle to fragile fences or mesh... so the lock is ok but the thief can break also the fence right?!Please buy a good U-lock and be wise in the proper use of it!This is a good lock, thick and with a key system not easy to break, it also come with 5 keys and a code you can use to request copies if you lost the keys, it is a little heavy and big so I dont recommend it for small bycicles."
1,Wrong lock,I don't know if the label is correct but I got a lock that looks different from the picture. I had an old lock like the one in the pic that I liked. I like this one less as the key gets jammed more.
1,Not lock in picture as advertised,"I lost my OnGuard lock that looks like the one in the picture, with the silver insert in the middle, which worked fabulous for a couple years.Unfortunately, this is not the product. This one is a bit longer than that, is all black on top with yellow emblem, and yellow rubber covers at the ends.I almost always have trouble getting this lock to close and open. Seems like the locking mechanism is incredible finicky and can't seem to align right. I took it to a bike store and they tried to oil it up and make it work better but it hasn't improved at all.Hopefully Bulldog will replace it under warranty?"
3,Pretty good for the price,"I bought this controller because it was on sale for $7 and i didn't have a wireless controller. It works well and is very responsive. Well worth the $7. It's got a turbo button feature which is really nice. the only quip i have is the overall design. it's not as comfortable as the regular PS2 controller. it feels bulky and is not contured at all. The direction pad isn't all that great. Overall, well worth getting if you can get it cheap and need an extra wireless controller."
3,They're okay but very small,This is basically a wash cloth. I'd recommend going with the aden and anais burpy bib over this product. It's much larger and has additional uses.
3,Great idea but not very durable,"I really like the look of these, but they are not as soft and after about 4 months of use, they are starting to show wear. Gave three stars for being organic and cute."
3,Kinda small,This was ok. Nice organic fabric but kinda small. My baby is growing and this burp cloth might be too small for him. Will try it.
4,Wonderful,"I thought that the five book epic of the Mallorian was a delightful book. It had all my favorite chacters from David Eddings first fantasy collection. Mr. Eddings if you read this,not to put to much pressure on you or Leigh but if you wrote another set of books I can gurentee you that I will be the first one in line to get an autogragh. Once again I loved all your books and I'm going give them to my kids when they get older."
4,Great Characters,"This was a very entertaining book, the characters were great, and it was a fast paced read. My only complaint is that I felt the main plot suffered a minor breakdown by the end of this book. The plot in the first series, the Belgariad, was better. Overall the Mallorean and the climactic chapters in The Seeress of Kell were a great read."
5,the final volume,Many people think David Eddings is overly formulaic which he is a bit but since I enjoy the tale he tells I do not mind reading it over again. His characters always have great humor at their core and you can't beat a good epic tale for entertainment value. This particular book is one of my favorites by him.
3,Anticlimactic and unworrisome.,"This is the fifth and final book in the Malloreon (after Guardians of the West, King of the Murgos, Demon Lord of Karanda and Sorceress of Darshiva).In this volume, the heroes first make their way to Kell and the place of the Seers to learn the location of the Place Which Is No More, where the final meeting between Garion and Zandramas must take place.They then sail to the Island of Perivor and its very Arendish society, and finally to the Turim Reef in the middle of the Sea of the East.I found this final volume rather anticlimactic. Even though Zandramas does everything to hinder Garion and his friends, trying to prevent them from reaching the appointed place at the appointed time, I knew (and not only because I've already read these books) that the Prophecy that's been dictating their lives and the destiny of the world for eons would get them there eventually, so I wasn't even worried about the outcome. The final chapters were a little too mushy for my liking too."
2,Definitely Anti-Climatic Ending !,"I just thought this ending was so bad. But, hey, at least it did end ! So, I give him credit for that. There was just no final battle. I really wanted a battle. I agree that the lack of ""choice"" in the characters made it a little borring. Still liked it, but just not there."
1,Boring...Boring...boring...,"The characters (Characters?) are Boring, Pace of the book is Boring, Ending is Boring, Action (Action?) is Boring, Whole series is boring. Eddings is not a writer, he just misuses people who are into fantasy. Who published this? Who is the editor? Can't I give Minus stars on Eddings?"
4,Great Book!!! I want another one!!,"The Belgariad and the Mallorean were some of the best series I have ever read by far... they were interesting, and I absolutely loved the characters! This book definitley needs another one to tie up some more loose ends. I really want to find out what happened to Vella and Beldin, the names of Pol's twins. DAVID EDDINGS WRITE ANOTHER BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,More of the same,"David Eddings may be the most lazy author in print. All the ""good natured bantering"" in this book is lifted verbatim from the first book and endlessly repeated through the next nine. His characters are never in any real danger and calmly take on 2,3, or even 10 times their number with only a scratch or two. I wonder how the Angaraks could ever be considered a threat when the heroes dispose of them in such an offhand manner. The second five books have virtually the same plot as the first five. This series is like a bad song for me; I can't get it out of my head. And how about the companion who dies?! He chickened out and killed off the least interesting and important character. If you are looking for a good fantasy series, don't read this one. Try Tad Williams' ""Memory, Sorrow and Thorn"" or George R.R. Martin's ""A Game of Thrones"", which is looking like it will be a great series (people actually get hurt and die)."
5,Seeress of Kell,"Having read both the Belgariad and the Malloreon, I would say the latter is the better of the two - a greater depth to the characters and a good helping of the author's humorous asides. The final book, Seeress of Kell rounds off the whole story in a far more complete way than did Enchanters End Game. It would be nice to have some further details, such as the destiny of Polgara's twins, but when you put down this last book, you look back to the very start in Pawn of Prophecy and realise the journey was well worth while. This whole series is fantasy at its very best, with no individual book better than Seeress of Kell. Highly recommended."
2,No surprises here,"They finally reach the final battle. Even the characters in this book admit the battle and the series is just like the Belgarion series. That's pathetic. You should already know who wins and what happens.They finally get to the Place Which is No More, and in an utterly anti-climactic scene, good defeats evil, and a new God is made.The ending is boring, surreal, unsatisfying, and actually occurs in the middle of the book. The reader must endure an extra hundred pages of fluff about weddings and ships in order to finish this series.After reading this whole series, I felt like I wasted a good 40 hours of my life. Like me, you'll probably never touch a David Eddings' book again.If you are curious, just ask someone about the series. They should be able to explain it all in about two minutes. No joke."
3,I am so sad,"The Belgarid was a good series, not all that origanal, but good nontheless. The mallorean was almost the exact same thing as the belgaried,group of people chase the badguy across the world, becaus ethe prophecy told them to. I cried at the end, though. I can't believe he flew away. He just turned into a bird and flew away. what a distinctly unsatisfying ending. (after you read the belgarid, you should just skip this series, and go to magaret weis's and ttracy hickman's dragons of autumn twiligh) the mallorean just wasn't worth the read, because once you read the belgarid, you know exactly what happens in the mallorean. i gave it three stars because i just had to know what happened to garion after the belgarid. I just can't believe he flew away..."
2,What was that about?,"For readers who aren't already wondering what the point to the previous four books was, this final volume will bring the question leaping dazzlingly to mind as the climax comes to revolve around a 50/50 jackpot that nothing which came before will influence. Follow that with the longest anti-climax ever written for a fantasy series (the story is essentially over halfway through), then ponder how this unnecessary 2nd series, so blatantly obviously written for the money, won over so many fans.(Note in the interest of fairness: I did not read the earlier Belgariad series.)"
2,Powerful Yes - Great Value - No,"We tried using it mainly for smoothies and had high expectations but came away dissapointed. Yes this blender has unbelievable power (which also makes it extremely loud), but we had to stop the blender often and mix the ingrediants, which is fine for a much cheaper blender, but I expected less intervention on our part with all that power. As another reviewer pointed out, we had our share of leaking at the base of the blender which was very inconvienent to clean up. We decided to go with the KitchenAid blender and have been pleased with the results so far. At least for the money, the Waring just didn't command it's high price."
4,"Noisy? Yes, Powerful? Yes, Needs Stirring> Yes, but still ..","The word which best describes this beast is Power. The noise is annoying but, happily it doesn't last long. My unit hasn't yet developed the leaks others complain about, but then mine is quite new.Madeleine Miller in the Editorial Review states that the blender comes with a ""replacement drive coupling and instructions..""Mine arrived with neither. When I complained in an email, the vendor phoned me and informed me that I had bought a ""refurbished"" unit, something I never saw in the item description, and that no spare drive coupling was included.He did, however, offer to send me the instructions."
5,Good product,Nice round cables to promote air flow. Work perfectly and there well made. Color coding is nice too. Just added that to get word requirement.
5,sterling asparagus server is elegant!,"The sterling asparagus server is elegant. You might wish to serve asparagus every week just to use it! It is a wonderful gift to give to special friends. Since the recipient of this particular asparagus server is a gourmet chef and often invites large groups to her home for sitdown luncheons and dinners, this server will be part of a beautiful presentation and asparagus will not longer be just another ""mundane"" vegetable. Everyone should have one. Even Francis the First would be proud of it."
2,The opposite of buffing,"I got these thinking that the label implied what they are supposed to be used for. I found that they abrade rather than buff or polish. They are made of hardened leather with an abrasive texture. If you need to remove light rust from a hard to reach spot, these may work. If you need to leave a high luster, they will not."
3,Nice Set - good value,I bought these cars for a poster display and I plan to give them away to my local charity as I have no kids living at home. My average rating is only due to the fact that I have no idea how much fun my son would have had with these cars if he were 15 years younger. He used to enjoy collecting them.
4,"Great cars, bad price",My friend's kids have those cheap diecast plastic cars that I hate. They fall apart and they just look cheap. These and matchbox cars will last throughout a child's childhood. The only problem here on Amazon is that the price is wrong. Much cheaper at Walmart.
5,You can never have too many Hot Wheels cars,"For all the times you want to relive LA rush hour traffic, you'll need lots of cars. This is a quick and easy way to get plenty more for your collection. Varied, as good a quality as any other modern Hot Wheels car, and of course my boys love them."
1,Cars for Criss Cross Track,Grandchildren disappointed - only a couple of the cars worked on the Criss Corss Track for which we purchased them.
5,Classic :-),My girls love playing with toy cars :-) this brand is really sturdy and they love the colors and style. Amazon has a great price too!! I was paying between 2 and 4 bucks per car at the store.. this was a nice find. my girls play with them all of the time.. i wash them almost once a week too and the paint is still great.Great gift :-)
3,Not Quite,"As you can see by the picture, it indicates that the book is flatsigned by John Updike. So, I was expecting mine to be signed. It isn't. I wanted the book and I'm going to keep it, but the signature photo really shouldn't be there.Thanks,DL"
2,More Than I Asked FOr,"I never ordered this book, but I got it and was charged for it. The vendor was quick but not careful."
5,Great Idea,"I installed this product in my kitchen last night. It looks good and also sounds very good. Both AM and FM reception is great on all my favorite stations. It is simple to install, program and operate. I highly recommend it!"
4,One nice radio/cd player.,"I bought this player about a month ago after installing one for a friend. I liked the way it looked and sounded in her kitchen and decided that I wanted one for me. Its a nice unit that is easy to use and has 15 pre-sets for the radio.The slot for the cd holds one cd. The sound is good, not great. I especially liked the instructions and template for installation. It made it very easy to look like a professional install. Especially for a guy who is all thumbs."
1,So disappointed,"I put aside my qualms about Sony sound products (my experience is that Sony is great for pictures, but their sound always goes) and bought this machine. For about two months, I revelled in finally being able to play my favorite music while trapped in the kitchen. I liked it so much I didn't even begrudge the money I spent having a handiman install it (no way could I have done this myself). So I was really crushed when one evening, the CD simply stopped working. I tried all the remedies described in the operating instructions, but eventually was forced to take it down (no small feat in itself). Though the machine is still under warranty, Sony's online repair service told me that it will be replaced with a factory refurbished model--not a new replacement. And of course, I have to pay to ship the thing to Texas to get my refurbished model. I am not happy at all."
4,Good Old-fashioned volume knob!,"How many times have you cursed the almost ubiquitous little volume ""up"" and ""down"" arrows on most new electronics? They are hard to press and they take forever to adjust. Here's your chance to get a decent under-cabinet clock/radio with a large, simple, functional volume knob located conveniently on the side. That alone is reason to give this unit serious consideration. I actually purchased this for my garage to go under the cabinets above my workbench (I have the Salton ""ICEbox"" in the kitchen, but that's over 2 grand). Its only weak point is the speaker output is not quite powerful enough - at higher volumes, distortion becomes evident. However, at most normal listening volumes, it sounds fine."
1,Dissatisfied,"If I were buying this item strictly for the radio, I'd be very satisfied. However, I bought it with the idea of playing CDs in my kitchen while I cook. An excellent idea - if the CD player actually worked! We also tried all of the suggestions in the manual to no avail. It rarely works; I'm very disappointed."
5,A Winner in This Kitchen,"For a white kitchen, I debated between this and the ICF-CD523.The 513 won out with larger controls centered on the unit and a larger display. The inevitiable finger drips, too, won't dribble into a nice, white grille as they would on the 523. They'll dribble on to a smooth, easily cleaned surface.As for sound, for this purpose, it's perfect. No, it's not a high end unit. But if you've used Sony audio before, you'll appreciate the solid quality, almost intuitive controls - especially the CD section - and Mega Bass sound.FM reception's just fine, even with the antenna embedded in the power cord. I just ran it under the cabinet like you would...an antenna! <doh!> No problem getting my ""Morning Edition"" fix or late nite jazz.Finally, you'll thank yourself for taking your time with the installation - measure twice, drill once."
4,Animal tale from the Hmong people,"The illustrations in this book are especially apt being draaawn from the embroidery style associated with the Hmong. The tale is a simple tale of a tiger told she would have nine cubs in one year being tricked by a bird into one cub in nine years. The ""exotic"" animals appeal to children while the story is humorous without any cultural barriers.This is an excellent choice for animal stories outside the traditional European culture."
4,Delighted!,"Originally, I had read this story with my 8 year old daughter for homework and 2 year old son loved it! There is nothing more pleasing then reading to a child who enjoys to listen. The book itself is VERY good and it keeps the kids attention. It has become our favorite ""family"" book."
2,Poor Reception and Unreliable Software,"This cell phone is ultra tiny. That's why I bought it. But, I was disappointed to find out that the reception on this phone is very poor. I've never had a problem with my service provider, so I had to assume it was the phone. It drops calls 50% of the time, and there is always background static and noise. The software doesn't seem reliable either. Sometimes the phone will stall, and I need to turn it off and then on again. I will be buying a new phone very soon."
2,Disappointed,I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes. I'm on my feet all day so it's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe. According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width. When I received them I immediately triedthem on. I had to double check if I ordered the right size. They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought. I was very disappointed to say the least. And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you.
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I bought a pair of Women's Plainview less than a year ago. I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months, so that the upper part is still very new and nice. Yet, I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there, which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes, I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand. I don't expect shoes to last forever, but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line. This brand does not meet that minimum requirement."
5,great,I had these before and they ware great.Long lasting and a good shoe. Buy themand you will never go backto the old ones.Kay
4,black oxfords,"Fit is true to size. Was a bit leary ordering, arches are usually an issue. I am on my feet at least 10hrs a day and have no aches or pains related to wearing these shoes. Toe is just wide and round enough to be comfortable without looking odd or big."
4,Great Work Duty Oxford,"I really like these shoes! These are really comfortable. I walk and stand, a lot, during my day and need a shoe that has some cushion and support. These are perfect in that regard. I have a slightly narrow foot and usually order an average (M) width. I find these shoes run a little to the narrow side. You may want want to order the wide width."
4,For Older Readers,"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a fascinating story, but I purchased it for an eleven year old, and its original presentation, i.e., use of words, and small print are difficult for someone of that young age to read and comprehend.It is a classic story that I hope she will enjoy later on."
5,Inspiring!,"I listened to his music in the early 1980's never realizing what his life was like. Although his life on earth was brief, his intensity and passion along with his unwavering determination to discover the purpose for his life and, when he found it in Jesus, to be authentic and determined in his faith, is an encouragement to anyone journeying on the narrow path that Christ calls us to. His life clearly displays how much God loves and seeks us out even when we are not living according to His will. A definite must read!"
5,Great ... Simply Great!,"This story of dedication is one that would be enjoyed by anyone! CHRISTIAN OR NOT! If you love heroic stories about people that keep at something until they get it right ... this is a book for you. It's not about some lame guy that gets 'Born Again' and then goes back to the 'same OLE,' same OLE'' This is a story about someone that wanted ALL of GOD regardless of the self cost he endured.It's great ... simply great."
5,Do not read this book.... unless you are willing to change.,"No Compromise: The Life Story of Keith Green completely changed my life. Keith was an amazing man: a loving father, a no-holds-barred speaker, a dynamic and very talented musician, a modern-day Christian prophet. He pointed a single finger up to his Savior, and brought thousands to him. His ministry endures, after death. ""Unless a grain of wheat...."""
5,I could not put this book down,"I have always been a fan of Keith's music. This biography gave me appreciation for the depth of his life's message. The search for God his hunger to share his faith is his ministry. His zeal reminds me of what Paul must have been like. This book has given me new perspective on the goal of a life of faith in Christ. Keith had a musical gift that few have ever had and was willing to lay down that gift. He was ""Bananas for the Lord""."
4,Real Christianity!,"For ""fans"" this is required reading. But if your a fan you know that Keith doesn't have fans, He has followers. I don't mean blasphamy, but his life and message are VERY strong. His life has changed many lives; like he has changed mine. Clothe the naked, feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, care for the sick... These are the good works of a christian, Keiths life will show you how to do this in modern society. If we all served without reservation the way he did, maybe we wouldn't miss him as much. Read this book. Then listen to his music! To be fan of Keith is to be follower of Christ"
5,Keith Green book : No compromise,"Written well, interesting and honest, I have enjoyed reading it and the message from Keiths life is still inspiring. Well done"
4,"Great products, not so much the book","I love these products but I don't really use the book. It has alot of outdoors recipes, if that's something that interests you."
4,Cast Iron Fry Pan Set,This is a great buy for the advid outdoors men. This set come with everything you will need to get started in cooking with CastIron. So enjoy and tell your friends.J.DeHaas
1,From Fan to Face off:,"I originally liked Geneshaft, when i infact liked Anime. Now I like niether, I found Geneshaft after many viewing boring and a bit repeative. I also would like to note that nothing in this story really appeals, infact it like most Anime is about girls and well some stupid FALSE RELIGION about Human existance.Funny, I once found this to be the greatest show ever, until my eyes where opened to the truth. don't buy this, unless of chorse you a fan and if you are I pitty you"
5,Must reading for Tar Heels and politics buffs,"Anyone who lives in North Carolina will learn much about the state's recent political history in this book. And anyone who is interested in progressive politics should read it too. Terry Sanford's forward-thinking approach to government is an inspiration, particularly in the areas of race and education."
2,Barely worth $15.00,"These are small, thin material and a small piece of foam for the thickness of the body. They are cute for a jungle themed room, but hardly worth the money and not as nice as I was expecting. A better price would be $9.99"
3,An interesting read on methods for success in life.,"The book by Lou Holtz was certainly inspiring, especially for anyone who loves Notre Dame football. Frankly, I was disappointed that a book devoted to the pursuit of excellence was obviously not proof read. Harper Collins Publishers seemed too anxious to crank this book out,as a result, there are many errors that even a casual Notre Dame follower would notice. Opponent's nicknames were misidentified, the first names of Holtz's players were wrong, and even some player's last names were misspelled. Time sequences in games were jumbled and confused In short, I admire Lou Holtz and his pursuit of excellence, but am shocked that he could put his name on a book thatis so poorly proof read!"
4,high school coaches: a must read!,"If you are trying to get an over view of college athletics and how it is suppose to be, get this book and read it, cover to cover...you'll learn a lot. ALL programs need to develop this mode of thinking..."
4,Excellent advice from the coach on how to win in life.,Lou Holtz has written a simple and motivating book that makes sense. The book would be excellent except for may errors in the text that should have been noticed. Holtz spells out his philosphy and the hardships he overcame to acheive his dream. We can do the same if we listen to him.
4,Very motivating. The same stories as in his speeches.,"Holtz has taken the stories from his speeches and written an excellent book. His observations of attitude and trust will help us improve our lives. The editor should be shot, however. Typos and editing neglect are shown on every page."
5,A gift,This was a gift to my son and his feedback was very good.He could identify and relate many points in the book to his own work experience.
4,Apology,"I apologize to all of you who got offended by my comment about the book's ""grammar"". I agree that one should be more attentive to his own errors when criticizing others. Please agree that it is also editors' jobs to weed out the errors and it was not done very well in this particular case."
5,A throughly entertaining and meaningful book,"As a long time Notre Dame fan and Lou Holtz supporter, I jumped at the chance to read his book. It had a message to send and I think that it did that very well. It didn't do it in just any way however. He used examples from previous experiences both on and off the field to send his message in a much more understandable and entertaining way. This book lived up to all of the expectations that I had for it and even surprised me with its humor. Holtz brings his past experinces back to life in a hilarious way throughout the book. He also includes comments on issues that I totally agree with. For anyone looking for motivation, sucess, or just a good laugh, this book is a must read."
2,eh,this product is just ok.... it is slightly moisturizing but doesnt help wrinkles or fine lines. Ive been using it about 6 months and i dont see any real difference. Its just eh... i wouldnt purchase it again
3,Mediocre,"I've been using this product for three months now and see no difference. In fact, I've seen more creasing, puffiness and bags around me eyes although I can't say it is because of this product. No adverse reactions to this product, but I'm sure any drugstore brand would work just as well if not better. I'm 29 and have tried many creams and wish this one worked as well as the cheap ones I've tried."
4,Mars Ill.. Bringing Hip Hop Back To Its True Elements!!,"One word for this album HOT.. Comprised of Man-Child(lyrical genious) and Dj. Dust (skillful turntablist) Mars Ill puts together a sound, which they boast to be ""Underground"", and yes they most definately do keep it real. On the Tracks ""Sphere of Hip Hop"" Pt. 1 & 2 Man-Child spits the real, reguarding the hip hop culture (the innovation that has brought it up, but also all the mess that is bringing it down), while taking you on a trip through the world of hip hop that has been evolving since Sugar Hill Gang released ""Rappers Delight"" A nice bonus on this cd are tracks by DJ Dust.. no lyrics, just the turntablist doing his thing on the wheels of steel, Brother got skillz.This album is a must to Cop if you crave anointed hip hop. Mars Ill has a style which could very well have made them a big secular act.. but dont mistake it, Christ is truly the CENTER of this album!"
4,The weather channel weather station,"Everything worked fine out of the box except for the wind monitor. After several emails to customer service, I returned the sensor and all is fine now. It has been easy to set up and read, and the service has been good. If I had it to do over again I would"
3,Windless,"I received this unit as a gift and most of it worked, well sort of, the wind read out does not work at all and the humidity is very inaccurate. I did contact La Crosse and wasn't about to pay shipping both ways and insurance to return the product, so I will donate the unit to a yard sale."
3,"Good weather station, but wind device does not work, so buy the lower priced item without","I had a weather station before and it was about half the price of the new one and the difference is a little different graphics and the wind and wind chill element. I installed it just the way the directions had provided, but the wind and wind chill do not work. When there are winds of 30 mph it shows at best 2.2 mph. I go down and make sure that it is turning, and it is. So save yourself some money and do not buy the one with the wind device."
3,OK BUT ----,The product is nice and all that was expected but ! ---Why is the complicated instructions micro printed? Fortunately I posses a good set of loupes and could read the chintzy cheap microprinted instructions. A good product should be ashamed of themseves!
1,Don't waste your money.,I have had nothing but problems with this unit. The external unit does not sync well. The outdoor components are not intended for outdoor use. No weather sealing at all.
2,Non functional wind speed.,"Almost a great device.After several attempts to get the windspeed to work it still fails to function. The rest of the unit works fine. I did find it frustrating to re-enter time and date after every attempt to sync with the wind speed monitor.I checked all connections, read and followed the manual precisely. It simply does not function.I'm sure it's a case of dumb luck that my unit does not work. However, keep your receipts folks =)."
5,Great Gift!,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it! He installed it right away and is constantly checking the wind speed. I like knowing what the humidity is in the house, and the little face smiles when it is in the confort zone. I highly recommend this product!"
2,Would have been a good costume...,"...if I was under 5 feet tall. It fit okay, but the top was so short, the costume's waist was about 6 inches higher than my waist. How they got it to be anywhere near her natural waist in the picture is beyond me."
3,not bad- but could be better,"This case is not bad but could be better. It fits the Treo perfectly and provides a nice cushion for it. My two problems with it are 1) the belt clip is really just a loop for the belt to go through- a clip would have been more convenient, and 2) while wearing it on the belt you can't feel the phone ring in vibrate mode. Other than these two gripes it is a nice case."
3,Functional but cheesy looking...,"Decent case for hiking or leisure - it protects the phone well. The major drawback is that it looks pretty cheesy, making it unsuitable for wear with business attire."
2,Cheesy But Necessary,I agree with others that this case is cheesy looking but given the relative tenderness of the Treo - its better than nothing. Still could they have designed it so that you didn't have to put the TREO in backwards - which I guess doesn't affect the functionality but it just feels wrong.
2,Velcro wears out fast,"I've owned this case for less than a year, and the velcro is already worn out. Iwould have preferred a metal snap, or a hook, or at least higher-quality velcro.Don't buy this unless you plan to buy a new case every 9 months!"
2,Could have been smaller.....,"Well, since this is the only case on the mkt, you really do not have an option but to buy it if you want to protect your treo. The case is quite bulky and could have been smaller if it were made of leather with a protective cusion just for the front."
2,"Are you all deaf, or what? This thing is LOUD!!!","I thought I was going to wake the neighbors (and the dead). Sure, it's nice to have a sturdy metal base, instead of the usual plastic, and maybe it's reassuring to have a good-quality two-speed switch instead of fifteen flimsy buttons offering everything from ""shmush"" to ""Fargo"", but does it really have to be so loud? Simple, beefy motor design is one thing; zero sound isolation is another. This seems to me like the worst of ""retro"": an old-looking design that behaves like maybe it really is just an old design. The blades don't look terribly sturdy - I wonder how they'll hold up in the long run. Not that I'll wait around to find out: I bought mine last night and am going to return it today."
1,Doesn't blend frozen fruit,"Mainly want to blend packages of frozen fruit & yogurt for smoothies. Requires blending for a minute, then stirring up contents, blending again, etc. If I have to keep stirring it, why do I have a blender? Only seems to work right on the bottom where the blades are. Perhaps a larger motor than 500w would help. Going to have to buy a better one."
2,Sounds like a leaf blower in the kitchen!,"The blender works great, but is unbearably loud! People leave my kitchen whenever I use it. It sounds like I'm running a leaf blower in the kitchen. The longer I've had it the less I use it. I'd return it if I could. I've gone back to using the cheap blender I used before."
1,"Loud, motor burns","Got this thinking it was a great deal when it was on sale at Amazon. Immediate burning smell from the motor. Continued for the next 3 days as I thought giving it time to get rid of factory lubricants etc may help - no such luck!Given the number of people that have had a similar experience, I think Waring needs to recall this entire line and/or Amazon needs to stop selling these in the interests of safety.Plus it's loud - why deal with all this when you can get better designed and manufactured blenders?"
1,Very disappointed in Waring - cheaply made junk,"I was expecting a solid, high quality blender that i could make smoothies in. I am very disappointed. The jar is glass and that is about the only quality component. The collar around the base of the jar that connects it to the motor base is flimsy plastic and broke very quickly. The motor had an awful burnt odor from the first time I used it. I only used it to make a smoothie 2 or 3 times a week and an occasional sauce or salad dressing. Not exactly ""professional"" use. I read that many people have had the same problems and returned their units hoping it was a fluke and got another with the same problems. I didn't bother and just threw it out. Bottom line: a piece of junk being marketed as high quality."
1,Shockingly poor quality,"The blender jar does not fit tightly on the base, it wobbles around loosely and makes grinding noises if too far off center. The motor has a strong burnt rubber smell. After 6 calls to waring customer service I finally got a hold of someone who explained that the blender is not defective. Both of these issues are normal. I really wish the engineers had done a better job. I love the look of the blender and would have been happy to support an American manufacturer in an industry dominated by Asian imports."
1,deafening,"I should have read the reviews before I bought this blender. It's unbearably loud. The first thing I did after removing the blender from it's box was make a smoothie. My wife and kids ran out of the room while I stood there, manning the blender, with my hands over my ears. I suppose the smoothie's texture was fine, but the blender was so loud my ears are still ringing. It will be returned tomorrow."
1,"Repaired Once, Broke Twice. :-(","I really want to support American-made products, and bought a Waring for its simplicity, good looks and it's ""Made in the USA"". Well I spent over a $... to to replace a 7-year old Asian-made blender. To make a long story short, it broke down in 3-months w/ very little use - my wife was adament to make it last as long as possible. We sent the blender to a factory-authorized repair shop (we paid the shipping), and it broke down 3-months later. We bought a cheap-chinese made blender for $..., and it's still working a year later. I will mail the blender back to Waring and tell them to keep their product."
1,Deafening,"I used my new blender for a few minutes an hour ago, and my ears still havn't recovered from the stunning noise. This is a bad design.4 Feb 2003-------------P.S. 11 Nov 2003 -- Gave good, heavy use (with earplugs at its side) until a few minutes ago, when (after weeks of changing, increasing noise) it died. I suspect a manufacturing defect."
1,Blender Blues,First batch of Margaritas the top blade came off. Poor design of a pressed on blade system.
1,bad product,"I bought this for myself with some of our wedding money about 5 years ago. I've been suffering with it over the years... not sure why. It works okay. The smell is really bad, every time. Also, it's crazy loud. I think I called the company about getting a replacement but they could care less. I was looking at Breville blenders... I bet they're better!"
2,Motor burned up within a month,"I purchased this ""professional quality"" blender at Target a month ago. I have only used it for smoothies (frozen banana cut into thirds, frozen strawberries, frozen blueberries, frozen spinach, milk, peanut butter--no ice) a couple times per week. This morning, mid-blend, the motor sounded strained, emitted a smoky odor, and I saw light reflecting from the motor onto my kitchen counter. Then, it stopped working completely!! It will not turn on any more.I am very disappointed in the life-span of a blender that I paid a reasonable price for expecting it to last for years. The carafe is a nice, heavy glass, solid and easy-to-use parts, easy to clean. But...The motor should last for at least the warranty period of 5 years, not 1 month. Not acceptable."
5,Solid blender,"We've had the this blender for about 6 months now and are fully satisfied with it. It got especially heavy use (more than once/day for several weeks) after someone in our house had oral surgery. It is noisy and nostalgic as others have eloquently written; it is reliable and shows no signs of disintegrating. Rather, its done an excellent job disintegrating ice, pecans, & everything else we've thrown into it."
3,Waring Kitchen Classic Blender,I bought this for a wedding gift so I don't know enough details to give an honest rating.
3,good power but...,"I am a regular customer of Amazon and would have bought this blender through them but found on clearance at Target for $50. The blender is great for it's power and every day use but its very noisy, and the top does not lock on the base. I will use and abuse it and buy a Cuisinart $59 model next time. Stupid me for trying to save a few bucks. The one thing I liked best... It's made in the grand ol' USA!!!"
2,Going back to Target,Not impressed for the money. The lack of pulse function combined with poor funnel action made for a frustrating (and loud) experience when making a smoothie (that had plenty of liquid in it).
2,"Looks nice, but.....","Nice appearance, solidly built but I live in an apartment and this thing is so LOUD that I stopped using it for the sake of my ears and those of my neighbors. After debating whether to get industrial grade ear protection, I dropped it off at Goodwill. Adios blender, vaya con dios!"
1,Not powerful enough to blend ice drinks,"Great, unless you use with ice. Mine was fine until I started using it on a regular basis for blended drinks containing ice,or smoothies with frozen fruit. It's performance declined rapidly and abruptly died."
1,"Smokin', stinkin', pretty little blender","Well, I just got my blender, real excited to use it, filled it up with the ingredients, flipped on the switch , and within 5 seconds it started smoking, badly, and then died. I turned it off and tried to turn it on again, and all it did was make a grumbly noise. So I am sending it back and sticking with my old Hamilton that I have had for 9 years. Why did I quit using it in the first place. $20 blender and it made a perfect smoothie. $79 for this Waring and it crashed and burned on me. My advice is it looks nice, but it isn't worth the money, especially since it died right away on me. Oh well...."
1,"It was DOA, so I took it apart ...","Waring WPB06 Pro Blender ""Made in the U.S.A."" ""500 Peak Watts"" ""Commercially Rated"" Model WF1112218 was DOA out of the box. Neither speed worked. Thinking that the power might not be connected to the switch, I took the bottom off the base. The power was indeed connected, so the switch was probably faulty.But in addition to the obvious question about quality control when a unit is DOA, the small gauge of the wires carrying current is grounds for concern. The baseplate claims 3 amps. The power cord is labeled 18AWG. Tables show 18AWG is rated 2.3 amps max for power transmission, 16 amps max for chassis wiring. The wires to the motor are unlabeled, but even smaller than 18AWG. Waring would probably argue that the wiring is adequate, but with so many reports of electrical failure they should consider an upgrade to the electrical, or a down grade from ""Commercial"" to ""Light Duty"".This one is going back for a refund, not exchange."
5,Gift with great warrantee,"I bought this as a wedding gift for a friend, during its first use, the motor broke. I will admit it was being pushed to the limit and I was not surprised that it couldn't handle the challenge. After returning all necessary information, Waring replaced the unit within a week. Great company to do business with!"
1,WARNING about WARiNG blender,"I had this belnder (but with a glass pitcher) and the motor just stopped after two and a half years of service. I was told it was NOT DESIGND to blend frozn fruit because of the fiber - I make smoothies daily.I mostly use frozen blueberries and raspberries. I would not consider that a heavy work load. Its not like I am belnding frozen hay or wood chips.Before this one I had a cheap plastic blender (brand???) that blended fruit and ice and who knows what else for years without trouble.Save some money and dont buy this, if you do buy it, fill out the warranty card and register the product!!!! Also, if from the start, you are not happy with the performance, take it back!"
3,Can't handle ice,This blender sadly didn't not live up to my smoothie standards. I still use it for fresh fruit smoothies and it blends those much better then my old blender. When using ice or frozen fruit the motor makes a funny noise and it starts to smell like burning. At least it matches the microwave ='(
2,Obvious engineering flaw,"I have always thought highly of Waring blenders. I was so excited when I was finally able to afford one. But, when I received mine there were two gaps in the top where the pour-through portion of the cap goes. Each time I started the blender, liquid would shoot out through these two holes. I called Waring, and they sent me another top, but it had the same problem. I eventually sent it back. It also didn't crush ice that well."
4,sleek as chrome,"This sleek chrome blender looks as great as it is efficient. It has a nice strong motor, which blends things super fast. Plus, the whole thing disassembles pretty easily so you can wash it out completely. Love it. If you're hesitant to spend the money, do it and buy this one, so you'll never to have to buy one again. Waring is the only brand of blender I'd recommend."
1,Disappointed,"I thought that for the price, I'd be getting a great blender. But it leaked after the first use (granted, I probably should have checked it first to make sure the parts were screwed on tightly). The most irritating part is that I like to drop almonds and pecans into my smoothies. My old blender (not the same brand) blended them so smoothly I couldn't notice them in the smoothie. This thing left big chunks of almonds and pecans. And, for the price, it's not as sturdy as I thought it would be."
1,Poor Quality Control,"Straight out of the box, I immediately noticed that the removable plastic seal/rotor assembly was rather flimsy for such an otherwise robust unit. My first blending task was a rather modest smoothy: 5 ice cubes, 1/2 cup milk, 1 banana. After roughly five seconds, it was obvious that the blender was not going to be adequate for even this minute job; five seconds later there followed smoke and the crackling of an electrical burnout.A brief perusal of the other reviews will indicate that my experience has been, to some degree, shared by others as well. Presumably, when the unit works, it works quite well, but with such blatantly poor quality control, should you even bother to take the chance? I think not."
4,We are all Creators,"If a book has the potential to change the way we think about our civilization then it's Creator. It more than just pokes fun at the human race; it showed me that we are all creators in one way or another.There is something very positive and optimistic about this book. It was fun to read. I liked the old fashioned style of writing, the author has created his own voice, its like reading a turn of the century novel that is, at the same time, brisk, and geared for our fast past society."
5,WOK this way!,"Love this wok. I am a wokaholic and this wok fits my life perfectly. I have used this wok almost everyday for the past 3 weeks and it is great. Food heats up evenly everywhere in the pan. I reach for this pan first for almost everything I fry or saute. I make omelets in this. I fried up some salmon cakes. Made some great sesame coated tuna steaks in it. I sauteed some kale with garlic and made carmelized brussel sprouts with walnuts. I even made a batch of cous cous and so on; the list is endless. I just dont need many other pans or skillets when I have this. My previous woks were good for about one and half years before they started showing signs of wear on the bottom of the wok, I hope this one since it is a CIRCULON will not show wear for 10 years. I will be happy with that. BUY THIS pan and donate your cheap pan to salvation army, hey YOU deserve a great wok!"
5,Grrrrrrreat!,"Pros:Heats evenlyHeats up fastCompletely non-stickeasy clean upAwesome for tossing pasta with sauce and meatREMEMBER!!! DON'T ever use your circulon cookware with HIGH heat.If you bother to read your insert, it tells you to use no higher than MID-HIGH, and Unless I am not boiling water, I usually use mine at MID temperature. It makes the pan last years in near perfect condition."
4,"Good, versatile pan","We have now used the pan a few times and it seems to work nicely. It is versatile and can be used for spaghetti sauce, frying, sauteeing, etc. Many uses. It seems sturdy and we are happy with the purchase."
5,Refreshing Bible video for children,"Amazing Bible Puppet theatre has clean humor references that perhaps older adults or children would only understand but it is sticking to the scripture. The emphasis on what is most important is brought out with creativity, wit and clarity. I would financially support the further production more series that stick to what the Bible actually said.My husband and I watched together with my four and half year old son. We laughed, we listened, we applauded the scenes of elation and victory in the Bible accounts. This video series of two accounts from the first and second books of Kings are appropriate for any age group."
4,Great mini power supply. Too bad I didn't get to use it much.,"Great power supply! Also was slightly shorter than the original, so it worked great in the small Shuttle XPC. Unfortunately, the mother board in the XPC was dead, so I couldn't use it, and I had to return it, but it worked ok in my other PC."
2,"Great Author, bad story","The plot was interesting, full of action like all his books. However, the main characters were so extremely ""perfect"" (they are gorgeous and geniuses at the same time) and the romance was so cheesy (they are PERFECT for each other and nothing is wrong with their relationship). Many plot twists can only be found in stories, for example, the main character needs to find a girl and it JUST SO happens that the first guy he met at a CONCERT knows who she is, and it JUST SO happens that the girl missed her plane ride when he got to the airplane. There are just way too many convenient conincidences to tell a story. There were also many inconsistencies of the book, and Brown seemed like he did a bad job researching about Asian cultures. I enjoyed Dan Brown's other books, but this one was disappointing."
3,Fun But Unbalanced,Digital Fortress offers up nail biting suspense but only with characters that could have used greater development. The heroes and villains lack depth and complexity but nevertheless follow a plot line that is interesting and informative and with occasional surprises to make this an overall good read. Since a lot of thrillers seem to follow this formula I didn't really fault this book too much for the above mentioned defects.
2,Not So Thrilling,"Other books have shown that Dan Brown is capable of of a far better effort than the one to be found in Digital Fortress, a thoroughly disappointing book. It certainly had the makings of an interesting read but Dan Brown never really rolled them into a coherent whole. Indeed, Dan Brown gave little indication tht he even tried to do so.It begins with a fairly promising subject matter and the basics of interesting character development. Regrettably, beginning is as far as it goes. The ostensibly intelligent characters prove to be dull and addicted to doing stupid things. Those stupid things compel clumsy manipulations of the increasingly disjointed plot.The childish disorder was vexing, almost a threat to serenity. It was a relief to be done with it."
1,A Reeker,"This is a piece of absolute trash. Dan Brown's writing skills are exceedingly limited, but at least Angels and Demons, and Da Vinci made a modicum of sense. Digital Fortress is a trackless waste that starts nowhere and goes nowhere. Save your money!!!"
1,Like reading the script to a TV show,"I am not a fan of Dan Brown, but I picked this book up at the airport for a quick read on the plane. It was more than disappointing. Anyone who has any kind of knowledge about the history of cryptography or mathematics will know from the start that the premise is bogus. The writing reminds me of a TV show. You can practically hear the music swell at a tense or touching moment. I found the characters to be thin and unbelievable ... charactures rather than characters.If you're looking for escapism and don't want to think too hard about what you're reading, then you'll enjoy this. But if you have any type of science or literary background, you probably won't enjoy this book."
1,Super Brains Behaving Super Dumb,"After reading Da Vinci Code, I had high hopes for this book but was severely disappointed. The characters are painted with a very broad brush of superintelligence yet they all behave supermoronically, instead. And the technology described is something only a truly clueless n00b would applaud. I realize it's supposed to be *fiction* and the research was conducted prior to 1998, but come on, Mr Brown, with all due respect, get a clue. The author should stick to what he knows and anything regarding crytography, encryption and/or high tech is most assuredly *not* it. Leave the sci fi story telling to Stephenson & Gibson."
1,doubtful technology,"As soon as I started reading some of the tech descriptions I just thought ""oh dear."" Somebody please tell me how you can store 64 characters in a 64-bit key? And did anyone not realise the significance of NDAKOTA as soon as they saw it.Worst of all is the character interaction. They pick some ridiculous things to argue about. And the top cryptographer, Susan, is completely brainless.A three million processor supercomputer? Please."
2,Take into account,"After reading some of the reviews for the book I feel I must sdd one small bit of information. This book was written in 1997 when the internet was still the ""Information Super-Highway"" that everyone was ""surfing."" The book talks of the greatness of Netscape! Just remember that it is dated and is not even close to comparing with the D Code. Take it for what it is, a semi entertaining book that will not kill many brain cells by reading it."
2,in the 10p Bucket,Well its an easy read - the pages flow pretty quickly. But you can just scan the chapters - and pick out the important bits.it is a shame that David Cheats death on so many occasions - that it looses all credibility. Some of the computer 'geeks' were so stereo typed as well......and who are these people who go to work on saturdays when they don't need to.None the less a good holiday read.
2,Digital Fortress,"A somewhat entertaining book, yet it doesn't rise to the standard set in Dan Brown's other novels. A fair amount of research was involved, however, the story was just too hard to believe (at least the way it was written). This is also the most predictable of the four Dan Brown novels written to date. ** September 2004"
4,"Quick, Easy Read",This is nothing along the lines of the Robert Langdon books; it's something else entirely. A thoroughly enjoyable read with likeable characters and an interesting plot line. I really don't know what more you can ask from a work on fiction. I like it.
3,Good turns but a little off someplaces with a slow end,"Dan Brown does know how to write an interesting novel with good plot turns and twists but it is always cookie cutter. His novels involve a intelligent professeur, beautiful and smart woman and some kinds of codes that need to be and always are broken. Also the person who is a friend to the woman and professeur is always the ""bad guy"". Still as predictable as it is it still keeps you capivated to the storyline. This book was the same way except at the end where I got the answer to the code a full 20 pages before the characters. And as in all of his books there are inaccuracies such as not knowing there are 8 bits in a character rather than 1. All in all I still would recommend this book to anyone who loves a thriller."
2,"Fast food - all calories, little nutrition","This book is what it is, which is a poorly written, highly predictable, cookie-cutter type of fiction that goes down real easy. The dialog is awful, the coincidences are truly astounding, and the action is truly unbelievable. (Who would believe that in this era, multiple gunshots in an airport - no matter what time of day - would not bring down a swift response by security personnel?)Having said all that, this book is a quick read and suitable diversion for a plane trip. It is not nearly as good as the Davinci Code, however."
2,More on the same theme,"If you haven't read any of Dan Brown's books, I would begin with Angels and Demons or Da Vinci Code before this one.Dan Brown spins a great tale, but Digital Fortress lacks the carefull detail and conundrum of his better works.If you are a Dan Brown fan, you'll like this book because it follows his classic model:good looking genius hero learns of problem when someone dies, murder mystersy feel leads you to assume inaccuracies of characters, characters developed as antagonists evolve to unsung heros, the bad guy ends up being an authority figure that is trusted by the hero..I enjoyed this book because I didnt' have a book for my 2 hr commute from work; it fit the bill, but didn't change my life."
4,great book,After reading Da Vinci code I wanted to check out the other books written by Dan Brown and honestly this one is probably my favorite.
1,not so good,bad even for a vacation book. I spent 3 days on the road and this book was so boring I had more fun looking at the cars passing by.
4,Good,"I would give this an excellent 5 star rating but I feel that the book could have been wrapped somewhat better. The wrapping was starting to come apart by the time it got to me, causing the book to be a little damaged."
1,FOR LEARNING ENGLISH ONLY,"For one, the technical thing in this book can only fool freshman undergraduate or less. The story has so many contradiction loop-holes. The characters are pale... yet I read this whole book just to learn English."
2,Blah ~ Totally bored out my mind,"I really expected more from this author - I kept reading thinking it was going to get better and it just never did. I think the theory and base story line with the code cracking and conspiracy elements were cool to start off with and that's probably why I kept reading, but the whole thing just fell flat for me, even with the cheesy proposal I just couldn't enjoy the book."
1,Not His Best,"Digital Fortress is a cyber thriller that leaves more questions than answers. I'm not going to beat the book up as there are several other reviews that have already done that.I'm a huge fan of Dan Brown and have not limited myself to his more popular fiction (i.e. Angels and Demons). I did not like this book. I'm not an overly tech savvy person but he lost me in several points. I know it is fiction but there were times where descriptions bordered on the nonbelieveable.As a reader, I felt that this book was a starter for him. As if he was finding his way with this book. It's up to you. Check out the samples pages provided by Amazon and see what you think.Keep reading!Engelia"
3,Meh.,"A bit predictable. Not the page-turner that The DaVinci Code was. It wasn't terrible, I just had it figured out too soon."
4,Second best Dan Brown novel.,The first Dan Brown book I read was Angels and Demons and I LOVED it!Digital Fortress was interesting and intriguing and I couldn't put it down easily.Every other book after that has been pretty much exactly the same thing. His plots pretty much don't change at all - only the setting and main characters. I've read all of his books so far (except the newest one The Lost Symbol) and I only really liked Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress.
1,Worse than lame,"Having read Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, and Digital Fortress I can only say he spins a good story if you can get past the nonsense. This one was the hardest to get through and the absolute worst of those 3 (not that the other 2 are stellar either). The plot is predictable and the characters are stupid (even though they hold degrees I can only dream of). Others far more knowledgeable than I can tell you how bad the technical stuff was, my limited knowledge just made it bad enough to wish he'd done just a little research to make it sound a bit more plausible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, not even an enemy."
5,Another great book by Dan Brown,I'll make this review short. I loved it. Couldn't put it down. Another excellent book by Dan Brown! I liked the fast action between chapters.
2,Not Too Impressed,"While all of Brown's books are very entertaining I found Digital Fortress to be slow and monotonous. I felt as though Brown was trying to fill up space in several scenes especially at the end. He goes at length to describe the simplest things creating a lot of overkill. With The Davinci Code, Angels and Demons, and Deception Point I never wanted to skip chapters just to avoid reading something I had already read. I found myself constantly avoiding the urge to ""fast forward"". Not one of Brown's best and I certainly would not call it a page turner."
4,Very good but not his best.,I liked this book very much. He's done better work but I still thoroughly enjoyed this. In my opinion if you like Dan Brown's writing you will enjoy this book.
2,Digital Fortress,"I truly enjoyed the da Vinci Code by Dan Brown and thought Digital Fortress would be as good. I was disappointed, however, because of the lack of character development. The main characters seemed remarkably similar to those in da Vinci Code without the same depth. The plot is good, but not a page turner. Lastly, the ""villians"" were ""lack luster."" It seems that Brown used more foul language and seediness to make up for real content and excitement. I was so disappointed I didn't even finish the book."
2,"for a ""smart"" book, it's pretty dumb","What I mean is, the book talks on and on about how brilliant the protagonists are - a head professor of linguistics, a brilliant cryptographer -- but these are the dumbest smart people ever. The book is peppered with sentences like ""he wondered what anyone would want with a ring with writing engraved all over it"" -- LA DUH! um, the fact that you are on a secret mission to get the ring for the cryptology department of the NSA? and you can't figure that out?Sad, I do like Dan Brown, but I'm glad I checked this audiobook out of the library because I would have been upset if I had actually paid for it. The narrator is decent, though.This book review is of the unabridged audiobook."
1,"Typing, and bad typing at that","I made my bones by reading all of Brown's novels: da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, Deception Point, and Digital Fortress, so listen up:1. Awkward phrasing? Check.2. Cardboard characters copied from previous DB book? Check.3. Totally bogus technology or theology? Check.4. Implausible motivations? Check.I actually enjoyed da Vinci Code, at least the first time through, but Brown's novels get progressively worse. I donated my copies of A&D; and DP to my gym's library, but with Digital Fortress I did something I've only done once before: I burned it.In Mark Twain's essay ""The Literary Crimes of James Fenimore Cooper"" he lists the 19 (some say 21) rules of composition, and states that Cooper achieved a record 15 violations in the space of 2/3 of a page. Brown beats that record every time.Try ""Eye of the Needle"" or ""Day of the Jackal"" if you want a good page-turner thriller. Remember, the hours spent with Brown's junk are gone forever, never to return..."
2,Disappointingly predicable at every turn,"I have to agree with the first reviewer. I, like many, became introduced to Dan Brown with the DaVinci Code... and having read that I decided to work backwards through his novels. While I do feel that Brown essentially writes the same book over and over (same outline, same character construction) he usually manages to make it interesting.This book could have been, but it is so utterly predicable that I could have stopped half way through (and mentally did) and finish it. I only kept reading it with the hope that he would fool me - he didn't. I knew the password for the elevator long before it was divulged, knew who the ""bad guy"" was from about chapter three, knew the ""unlock code"" as soon as the first hint was given - something that took the NSA characters another five or six tedious pages to figure out.Brown turns his intelligent characters into drooling idiots in this novel. Give this one a pass. Enjoy his other works."
2,"Lots of suspense, not much substance","I really liked Da Vinci Code, but I was disappointed to find that this book wasn't even in the same ballpark. I gave it two stars only because it had the same level of suspense that made it hard to put down. The dialog was terrible - some of the lines towards the end were just plain cheesy. There were a lot of technical holes in the plot that just didn't make any sense."
2,"Great story, bad writing","After reading DA VINCI CODE, I figured any other book Dan Brown wrote would be great. Wrong. DIGITAL FORTRESS has a great and exciting premise but the writing was horrible. Many, if not all, the paragraphs start out the same way with the same sentence structure. A lot of the sentences are actually the same thing with different words in place.Read it for the story but don't expect a decent writing style. Don't waste your money. Borrow it from the library or a friend."
1,Did you ever visited Seville or Spain??,"This was my third Dan Brown's book. I liked the Da Vinci Code, and did like Angels and Demons, but Digital Fortress is just a waste of time.The least you expect from a writer is research, and Dan Brown has not even researched on where Seville is or what are Spaniards habits. Reading the book I found a lot of inaccuracies and cliches that are unacceptable, for instance:- Sevilla is in Andalucia, not in Extremadura, as mentioned at the beginning at the arrival at the airport- People do not dress in black to go to church- Communion is not at the beginning of the mass...The lack of accuracy in these and some other issues make me believe that the other books are also full of mistakes.And just another thing, the book is not yet translated to Spanish but I do not believe that Spaniards will appreciate his whole approach to Spain and Spaniards, which by the way is very outdated"
1,"If this were the real NSA, the world would be in trouble","I have spent many years working for the government with people who possess high clearances (top secret and higher) and this is what I have to say about the book:1. Haven't finished it yet. I'm around page 300 and something and I may finish it out of morbid curiosity.2. I'm still trying to figure out what the physical attractiveness of the protagonists has to do with anything.3. The dialogue is full of sexual innuendo and there's a high degree of overt sexual harassment that seems to be going on which, in the real world, would almost never happen.4. Susan Fletcher is an idiot. There is no indication in the portrayal of her character why she is considered brilliant.5. The character Hale would never be allowed within 10 miles of the NSA in reality.If all the people in the story were portrayed as realistic people in this industry, I would find the story of their inner struggles riveting as the story unfolds.Very disappointed."
1,Hopeless attempt at articulating the science of Cryptography,"This book has so many holes in the plot line, it will make you cringe if you know anything about Cryptography, software programming, or network security. The perceived hacker attacks that Dan Brown orchestrates are plain dumb.Setting aside all that, his characters are also hard to relate to. The cheif of the NSA Cryptography who spent all his life working hard to get to where he is now, is willing to give up everything in an instant for a woman by murdering her fiance?. Even more unbelievalbe is that this character choses for a password that girl's name. Common! Head of NSA Crypto, uses the name of someone he knows as his password? They teach a secretary at a paper factory not to do that.After reading both Angels & Demons and Digital Fortress, I find a pattern that attributes the catastrophic failure of a great man to a crush on the hot, smart girl who is in love with someone else. I wonder if this stems from personal experience."
2,A good effort considering ...,This book was authored in the 90's. The technology depicted in the story is outdated today. I knew that when I read it and was able to enjoy the book for the suspense and plot twists that Brown is particularly good at.
4,Digital Fortress,"Dan Brown did a superb job with this book. It delves deeply into the world of computer technology. Its plot moves you across the multitudes of computer levels and also across the Atlantic Ocean to Spain. Obviously Brown has traveled to Spain, or at least he made a very good impression of it if he didn't. His investigations into computer technology were as good as one can expect. A very good page turner. Charles A. Reap, Jr., author, ""Devil's Game,"" and ""My Friend Sam."""
2,Dan Brown lite by Dan Brown,"2.5 stars. This author's non-Robert Langdon narrated books such as Digital Fortress and Deception Point definitely lack the sizzle of his mega-hit The DaVinci Code and the almost as entertaining Angels and Demons. That doesn't make them bad. They're equally easy to read, but simply not nearly as memorable."
2,disappointment...,"While I really enjoyed this author's other 3 books, this one was a struggle. For months I read and re-read the first chapters, trying to get past my annoyance of the main characters, especially Susan. Susan is a completely one dimensional character and throughout the entire book, she proceeds to whine about missing her new boyfriend, her worries about him, etc. etc. I genuinely wanted the ""good"" characters to not make it out alive, and that's not a good sign.Check out Deception Point instead."
5,Don't start this if you have to be somewhere else,"Be afraid, be very afraid!! Killing to protect secrets that may not really be secrets anyway. A government that doesn't trust its people, a people who are too naive to believe their government might spy on them. Amazing story, wonderful characters and terrifying in its realism. DON'T START THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVE TO BE ANYWHERE ELSE--BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE TO CANCEL YOUR APPOINTMENT!"
1,So bad... so very very bad...,"Oh my... Talk about riding the wave. This book must have been written in Dan Brown's spare time while flying around signing his one of his best sellers. This should never have made it to press.IF you read the book and believe anything found within it you must not be reading this on a computer. Basic knowledge would have precluded you from any belief in this book.IF I had it to do over again I would have bought any other book sitting near this one... actually I would have opt'ed for sitting on a flight, in coach, with nothing to do for 8 hours rather than have to read this book again. I only finished it in the hopes it would get better. It didn't..."
2,Stupid,I don't know much about encryption algorithms. But I can still say that the book is stupid and was written with out any research.Even if you forgive that the book is not entertaining at all.
3,A decent summertime read,"They can't all be Da Vinci... this book was just the ticket for lounging at the beach... entertaining enough, but not so much of a page turner that I couldn't keep an eye on the kids."
3,Digital Fortress: A Thriller - almost ....,"Dan Brown focuses his attention on the cyberspace front and while there are some taut moments and some intrigue throughout most of the book, the ending left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It was though the publishing company gave Brown a good two days to write the last thirty pages. It was rushed and obvious, wrapped up in a spectacularily quick fashion that was ultimately unsatisfying. It was as though Dan Brown wrote most of it, sat down, watched a bad episode of ""Murder, She Wrote"" and decided ""I could tie my ending together in a matter of two pages ..."". This is his first book and it shows in the ending. You can enjoy it but the disappointment in the ending takes away from an interesting premise and Dan Brown's incredible writing style."
2,Whew! What a Stinker!,"This is the only Dan Brown novel I've read. The others MUST be better. The story line is like a serial comic book..incredible coincidences, one narrow escape after another, fantastic turns of events. Many characters are billed as super geniuses and yet make moronic mistakes that would be considered stupid for even the average Joe.The ""science"" is a little bit of real technology mixed with a lot of half truths and outright garbage. I think Brown might have intended some kind of statement about government's right to snoop in order to save society, but the message is so muddled that it's impossible to decypher (pun intended)."
2,"cliched, predictable, unrealistic, tedious","Cliched: I loved DaVinci code but this not the same class of novel. The writing is riddled with cliches, I expect the phrase ""he turned on his heel"" in high school essays but not a best seller.Predictable:The plot was almost totally predictable. I think I figured it out after a couple of dozen pages. Usually with a Dan Brown novel it's the guy you least suspect that has a hand in it. So save yourself the trouble and just look for that character early on.Unrealistic:The idea of a graphical display of the hackers penetration is laughable. If you can identify them you can stop them.Tedious:The hunt for the **** was tiresome in the extreme. It seemed contrived to spin out a few more pages of the middle of the novel.I am amazed that reviewers like this stuff. I will stick to reading Houlbecq in french, who seems the only worthwhile modern author."
2,Unimpressed,"While I am a fan of Mr. Brown's later work, I was unimpressed with Digital Fortress. His understanding of the technology is clearly lacking and his attempts to fictionalize them makes for a rather boring read."
1,If there were less stars.....,"I listened to this rather than read it but I can't imagine that the print version could be worse. If anyone has abused themselves by listening and reading it I would question their ability to maintain membership in the human race. I weep for the narrator, hopefully he collected hazard pay."
1,worst book ever,"Seven of us listened to the audio version of this book on a car trip to the Boundary Waters. The only enjoyment we received was laughing at the cringe-inducing narrative.As a friend said, ""It is repetitive, redundant, and repetitive.""I will waste no more time thinking about this work."
4,A fun one...,"I recently heard the author speak at a technology conference and was impressed. I bought Digital Fortress, not sure what to expect. It was a pleasant surprise. Fast, intelligent, and full of surprises. I'm giving it a four instead of a five only because I can't break the darn code at the end!"
5,Great fun!,"I picked up Digital Fortress on a bookstore recommendation and although I often don't finish novels I start, this one definitely held me. The technical stuff was easy to understand and quite cool (I had no idea about the NSA or code-breaking before reading this.)Although the chase scenes seemed a little drawn out, I found I just kept flipping pages. The twist is surprising too. Strongly recommended for anyone who likes fast-moving thrillers."
2,Fast paced thriller poops out..........,"The first 75% of this book is fast-paced with lots of action and numerous plot twists. Then, it sort of dies. The lame ""riddle"" that must be solved by the government computer nerds at the end of the story regarding the hiroshima and nagasaki bombs is just plain dumb and the characters, who were somewhat intelligent up until that point, take stupid pills. Also, as was mentioned by some of the other reviewers, the revisionist history/political correctness in condemning America's ""despicable"" act using the bombs on Japan gets tiresome. The bombs ended the war; a war that was killing 35,000 US servicemen each week. Too bad the author flubbed at the end. Up until that point, it was a fun read."
3,"Not great literature, but a fun read","Last night I couldn't sleep because of a cold and wound up reading the whole book in one sitting.It was kind of fun and I enjoyed it more than ""Da Vinci Code"" - mainly because there were fewer really easy codes for the geniuses to spend chapters puzzling over while the reader got them immediatly. Still, a room full of techno-geniuses who don't know what isotopes are is a little far-fetched.It requires significant suspension of disbelief, and it probably helps to be over-tired and feverish, but I think it would make a good airplane/beach novel."
3,A Stepping...,This probably the initial stage of Dan Brown's writting style of the later success of Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code. Read as you may.
4,Great Story.......................,"Ive read both Angels & Demons and The Davinci Code, and I didnt find this story as well written as the other two but still a great story none the less. It wasnt all that long, finished it all in one day, and loved it. If you liked the others you'll like this one too. Id like to see Dan Brown make a second one including the same characters as well with Susan and David like hes done with Robert Langdon."
1,Unmitigated drivel,"Where to start ? I started with the Da Vinci code. As a friend expressed it ""Indiana Jones in book form"". The book was exciting but TOO far-fetched for my liking. Waiting for a train, I bought Digital Fortress - BIG mistake. The book is ridiculously predictable, from the ""rugged handsome"" looks of the hero (yes, even that tired old cliché got included), to the usual professional assassin who never fails, but still manages to do so half a dozen times when up against a language teacher, to the heroine who knows the answer to it all, wants to tell her boss, but is told ""Not now, Susan "", whereupon this strong, brilliant cryptographer shuts up !!!!!And I LOVE the ending. I never knew it was possible to look at a screen showing hackers trying to break into a system, and KNOW that, yes, they's managed to get some information, but only partially. Wow - that's some screen !!!!Aaaaaarrrrgghhhh. DON'T waste your money on the book - donate it to the Red Cross or something similar instaed"
3,Not that thrilling... Finished begrudgingly.,"This book was not horrible but the facts and details it contained really felt like they had been ""dumbed down"".This book feels like it is destined to become a ""made for T.V. movie."" Oh well, perhaps it will have some interesting footage of Spain!"
2,entertaining but...,"i found the book to be mildly entertaining...as previous reviews have stated this guys knowledge of computers isn't more than skin-deep (or windows-deep, heh)the plot was fairly predictable and the characters were extermely linear.i would hope this book is not normal for Dan Brown's work..."
2,A book that drug on and on...,"Not like his others, this book was about 200 pages too long. Pretty much drug on for the last 200 pages. His other books, I wish were longer, this one was done and figured out by the middle of the book. Still have to admit, it was worth reading."
3,Spain is not like that,"I like Dan Brown's books,but I disagree about the image of Spain that is shown in the book.On the other hand there are a lot of mistakes. For instance, Burgos is not near of Valencia. I supose that Dan Brown meant Palencia.He told that David Becker dashed down leaping four or five stairs at a time, but, as long as I remember, in La Giralda there are not stairs, there are ramps.The book is not translated to spanish. Anyway we don't like read that Spain is a ""less refined country "" .And I think that is not true that getting an international connection from Spain is like roulette."
1,figured it out in 50 pages...,"if you've read any of dan brown's other books, you probably already know the storyline of this book. all of his books have similar characters and are written with the same formula. the details he included about cryptography were very basic, not very exciting, and extremely predictable. the mysteries the characters have to solve are simplistic and i was able to solve in 10 seconds what it took the characters 4 chapters to figure out. i know many readers are going to think this review is a load of you know what, but then again, most reviews on amazon are. then again, maybe it'll save someone a few bucks."
3,"Better than ""DaVinci,"" worse than ""Angels,"" but still fun","Dan Brown once again shows his skill at crafting page-turners in ""Digital Fortress"" but once again also illustrates how he can't create a decent character to save his life. The writing is servicable and the plot this time is quite compelling--an unbreakable code that threatens government surviellance of the Internet. He also nicely summarizes some of the arguments AGAINST government surveillance of the Internet, and adds some nice plot twists and action sequences. Better than run-of-the-mill Crichton, but if Brown would take some writing classes, it could actually be good."
1,Painful,"I enjoyed the fast pace of Davinci Code (but wouldn't necessarily recommend it because of the poor writing), however I couldn't wait for this to be over. The novel failed to grab my attention and the ending was PAINFUL. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the final clues pages before the characters of the book did."
2,"Good idea, but wait...","I like a good plot, I love good characters that move, flow, and adapt in a seting. A good closure is the heart of any good novle. This book, while writen pritty well fails on most fronts. Were I nsa, I'd never have hired most of these people. Susan reminds me of a chick from <fill in the blank> horor flick. She's frightened and acts like a blond bimbo. Greg just goes nuts and doesn't act like I'd immagin he would. Dave, the perfect companion to sexy Susan should have been killed! The killer, like in so many books keeps f...ing it up. One can't miss that many times if one is good. The ending, the closure is stereotipical. Down to the write and the day is saves. There is no sence of the events really hitting this cast of characters, no real aftermath. The only thing that's of some interest is the reader's digest historical lesson on cryptography. Though things are simplified, and the nsa isn't as secret as he would lead us to believe. It's a great book when you're on the pot. :)"
1,Mr. Brown should recall this one,"I bought this at an airport bookstore without looking at the year of publication (1994) and was mislead by the cover, which proclaims a No. 1 bestselling author, not a bestselling book. It's nothing more than cynical capitalization on the Dan Brown brand -- it's a painful read and very hard not to put down. Perhaps you are turned on by cutting-edge writing about the ""Internet"" and computer ""viruses;"" if not better leave this one on the shelf."
2,Worst Brown novel I've read,"I've read the DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, and although I thought they were severly flawed, I did enjoy reading them. I can't say the same thing for Digital Fortress. Yes, it's a quick read, but it's a dull one as well. Like in his other novels, Brown's facts are wrong (regarding atomic bombs, Enigma, modern Spain, etc.) and there is subtle anti-Catholicism here as well, most notably, a shooting spree during Mass. (note to Brown, Spaniards can't do it first - you CANNOT have Communion before the consecration!)Over all, this is boring read, with unsympathetic characters and a really obvious and predictable plot. There were no surprises here. Skip this one."
1,Plot is terribly flawed,"I stopped reading this book after I found out that one of the main characters, a ""brilliant"" cryptographer, was trying to upload a fake copy of a program to replace a real copy on the internet. Did Dan Brown not consult with any experts? No one posts a program on the internet of that much importance with out also adding a verification hash. That is extremely basic internet security. I have begun MUCH more skeptical about his other books as a results."
2,Too Predictable,This was my third Dan Brown book - and the least interesting. I highly recommend you try the Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons which were more enjoyable.
2,Disappointed,"After reading The Da Vinci Code, I was a fan of Dan Brown, but Digital Fortress was a big disappointment. The romantic parts were cheesy. The book, and especially the ending (which was very predictable), is an insult to cryptographers who were supposed to be the best of the best in the book but who took half the book to figure out a simple riddle that took a common person like me all of 2 minutes to solve. This book fails to challenge the reader intellectually."
2,Rather mindless,"This is supposed to be a thriller, but the plot is so contrived and unrealistic that my reaction was simply to race through the easy reading to see if there was any satisfaction in the ending (There isn't). Anyone with understanding of computers, viruses, or encryption will have a hard time plowing through the unbelievable plot line. When the adventures of the college professor (incredibly sent by the NSA to Spain to retrieve a critical decryption key) reveal him to be more capable and spy-savvy than James Bond and able to not only avoid but kill a trained assassin, credibility goes out the window.The author apparently thought that an abundance of exclamation marks would satisfy the criteria for a thriller, but the net effect reminded me of a juvenile Hardy Boys tale."
1,Insipid book. Waste of time,"Dan Brown's Digital Fortress is an unfortunate attempt at throwing together a quick and dirty thriller novel. It seems as if throughout the novel he uses tidbits of information gathered off a single website regarding internet and computer security systems. Given the amount of research that went into THE DA VINCI CODE (which borrowed in part from ANGELS AND DEMONS), the ""research"" in this book is embarrassing. Grabbing snippets of geekspeak and hacker terms and molding it to a weak plot did not make the book a techo-thriller. It made it look rather confused and disjointed. The technical inaccuracies (confabulations) aside (the book was full of them), the lack of proper character development as well as the choppy flow of the action in the book made me think this was Dan Brown's first attempt at writing. What went wrong, Dan?"
3,"Pretty entertaining, I thought","This was the first book I read from Brown and since I work in technology I found it to be very entertaining. The techno-jargon wasn't too overwhelming so it shouldn't intimidate the layman. I would recommend it.Anthony Wilbon, Author of ""The Enigma of Njama"""
2,The worst of Dan Brown (which isn't necessarily a bad thing),"I made it my mission this summer to read all of Brown's novels, and having accomplished that goal, I can say without reservation that Digital Fortress is at the very back of the pack. It was certainly suspenseful, as all of his books are, but the topic of this book was lacking the intrigue, depth, and meaning of his other books' subject matter. Of course, the debate over balancing national security and personal privacy is an important one, but Digital Fortress falls flat as a social commentary.This book is best described as an old-fashioned whodunnit thriller/murder mystery that happens to take place in an ultra-modern setting (the NSA complex). Meanwhile, as kind of a side-story, you've got a college professor on a wild goose chase through the streets of Spain. The whole thing just doesn't quite work, but the cliffhangers at the end of each chapter still keep you turning the pages right to the lackluster finish."
1,OK to read if you have nothing else better to do.,"Da Vinci Code was fascinating and I was expecting another good read, but was sorely disappointed. I don't totally blame Dan Brown - the publishing company unearthed this obviously older novel to piggy-back on Mr. Brown's current popularity. It was terribly out of date and full of holes."
2,Intriguing Storyline-Disappointing result,"Priot to taking on the Da Vinci Code, I thought I would read the Digital Fortress to get a feel for the author. The first 100 pages set up a very interesting premise but the storyline, involving a couple of all too perfect protagonists, then got preposterous; sort of like a soap opera. The plot took the reader down a lot of boring dead ends and the ending was all too predictable.Overall, the writing was shockingly bad for an accomplished author. By most accounts he has improved for the Da Vinci Code.Thank goodness."
1,No logic whatsoever,"This book made me more or less mad with all logical errors and stupid things. I read it all the way, even though I really thought the story sucked. Save your money and time, read something else!One example of the lack of logic... one of the characters of the book is running through a room where all kinds of alarms and sirens are flashing, roaring and things are almost burning of heat, the air is full of smoke. It is a matter of seconds for the person not to be caught in flames so he's running as fast as he can... and his cell phones rings... so he stops to answer...If he at all would hear the phone in the alarming noice (he wouldn't!), would he stop to answer in a situation like this? Nope! Whould he at all be able to hear the other person talk with a 130 decibel siren nearby? No way!So that's on of the logical errors..."
2,A Good Thriller but with too many Technical Inaccuracies,"The witting style is good and it is difficult to put down the book after you have started reading in. However, there are way too many inaccuracies that even non-cyber-minded people can notice. <SPOILER ALERT> For instance, the author should know that tampering with a file, which is available on the Internet, *after* the file has been downloaded by people throughout the world, does not tamper with the already downloaded files; and the least that can happen is that people will notice that two versions are going around! </SPOILER ALERT>"
2,digital copy,"This book is the Da Vinci code with the names and grail changed.It has a beautiful but super intelligent heroine and some smart men around her with various infirmities of personality or physique and they all battle it out to get to the secret code before it all blows up and lets out some secrets of the US govt that have not already been leaked. Its rubbish writing, improbable plot and in the end you're sort of hoping they won't find the code and the billions spent on these corporate state secrets do get out into the much saner world outside the Digital Fortress. If you have ever wondered why Americans get it so wrong in foreign policy, the fact that this is considered a believable and well written book gives a clue."
2,"Good Read, Bad Facts","This book is about 90% fiction and there are many computer security claims made in this book are just not true.1) A tape backup would have resolved all the issues with powering down the TRANSLATR,2) Firewalls and the computers they protect never ever co-exist on the same computer. They are purposefully seperated for a demilitarized zone.3) There are multiple layers of security in place. User IDs, passwords, enhanced passord authentication, access controls, encypted circuits.4) Impossibe to create a non breakable encyption code.5) Skipjack wasnt about a trojan horse, it was just a poorly designed and marketed algortim.There are some intriguing ideas about the NSAs ability to code break all communications."
1,Junk junk junk junk,This book is junk. The story is unconvincing and written like an action-movie script. It contains several technical errors and assumptions. The plot is not credible. The end is weak.
1,Where's the proofreader?,"I didn't make it past the first sentence, in which ""smoky mountains"" was not properly capitalized. Seriously, with the success he's had with previous books, you'd think he could afford a proofreader."
1,Read his other books.,"I'd rank his books in this order (first to worst): The DaVinci Code; Angels & Demons; Deception Point; and this turkey. Do not read this book -- you will regret it. The characters are supposed to be some of the smartest people in the world, and they are as dumb as a box of hammers. And while I have been able to suspend disbelief in his other books because they were just so much fun, I couldn't do it in this book, because it is NO fun. It was written around 1998 -- when we were gearing up for Y2K and the whole world was installing a trillion safe guards around the systems and data. Who would believe that the NSA wouldn't have better security on their systems/data? The villain is obvious from about the first minute he speaks. Again: do not read this book. You'll be so sorry you wasted your time."
4,Good plot and exciting development,The 1st novel written Dan Brown. Good plot and exciting development.
2,ummm....how about an ending?,"THREE! THREE! THREE YOU STUPID MORONS!!!!!! you could've heard me yelling as I listened to the end of this audiobook. Then, it actually went downhill with the rest of the ending.Up until then, I found Digital Fortress to be high mediocre, bordering on ok. I hadn't figured it all out in advance, which is usually a plus, but the reason it can't be figured out, is the unbelievablity. These idiots can't really be in charge of the secrets of the USA, can they?My advice, listen to CDs 1-8, skip the last two, they won't enhance your experience."
3,need more research,"I love Dan Brown books. I have to say, I've learned much about France and Rome reading DaVinci Code and the Angels and Demons. However, Dan Brown has to do more research in computer world and basic ideas about JAPAN. The book was based on events in DC with National Sercurity Agency and in Spain involving chracters who are both based in US and in Japan. His knowledge of the Japanese and Japanese culture depicted in the book, albeit small, are so inaccurate, it is almost offensive. Names used, chracters portrayed about the boss getting massage naked in their offices.... my goodness! and Dan Brown is a teacher and graduate of Exeter? He needs to go visit Japan more often or have few Japanese friends. May be we need to send more sushi chefs in New Hampshire.That is your home work for you, Dan."
4,Demerits for typos,"Good action movie, er, novel. But they rushed it out too quick. It has annoying typos, including one that an earlier reviewer pointed out is essential to understanding a section of the book. Fire that proofreader!"
2,Dysfunctional Fiction,"Digital Fortress has the feel and packaging of well researched fiction. Set in contemporary times (at the time of writing, 1998) Dan creates appealing plot and pace. Unfortunately he sets the stage in a strangely depicted set. For example, I am not sure if the book is trying to suggest a fantasy country, but what's on the book is not 1998 Spain. Try somewhere else, or perhaps Spain in the 1950s or 1960s? After reading about the deadly steps on the Giralda and the urine smell in the hospital I couldn't help but look at the writting feeling it didn't have a good fit and finish. It left a taste of very weak fit and finish."
4,Nice thriller,"Very good book, you can't resist to read on. It has the atmosphere of movies like The Sum Of All Fears, with high level conspiracies and some action..."
2,Sugar and too little research,"I've got no much knowledge of cryptography, but the end of the story sucks. After they find out the worm is only attacking security layers for entry management, why not just close down the modems or manually remove the cables for outside communication.Otherwise it's a very nice plot, but covered with Hollywood sugar and not real people."
2,somewhat entertaining,"I read it en route from Johanesburg to San Francisco ... I kept reading with little other options on the 22 hour flight. Wikipedia states that it was written in 1998 - and based on the computer science referred to, I think that early date is believeable. It's just an average book and does not compare to Brown's later ones."
1,Fatally flawed,"I had recently read The DaVinci Code and it was mildly entertaining but not as great as my friends had led me to believe. This book is totally flawed from a technological point of view. Nearly every detail, not just of cryptography but of software and hardware in general is wrong. The total misrepresentation of public key encryption should have been a tipoff early on, but I doggedly read on. But getting the technology wrong was the less egregious offense in this book. The biggest problem I found here was the attitude that government should have the legimate power to invade citizens' privacy in order to protect them. Further, the denigration of the Electronic Freedom Foundation was in pretty poor taste. If I could have given this book negative stars, I would have...it really is that bad."
2,3 out of 4 isn't bad,"After devouring all four of Dan's books, this is the only one that I didn't like.In the middle of the book I had a tremendous desire to throw the book away - I wish I had.Way too predictable and dialogue just not up to par.Read the other three.Can't wait for his next book."
2,Unable to suspend disbelief,"I'd enjoyed Brown's The DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons, so thought I'd give his older stuff a try. Good thing it came from the library. I haven't been so very happy to return a book that I've actually finished reading in quite a while. The techie parts of the book required so much suspension of disbelief that - well, the suspension gave way. If the plot hadn't relied on those parts so extensively, it might not have been *so* bad.To read, or not to read: Nah, wait for Brown's next book."
1,Very Disappointing,Just didn't live up to my expectations after reading Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons. I should have skipped this one.
2,very average,"I read The Da Vinci Code first and then Angels & Demons and they were both incredible reads. But this book is disappointing. There was no intrigue, it read very slowly and a lot of things are cliche and predictable. The main character, Susan Fletcher was so boring and too perfect. No surprising twist at the end. I'm going to read Deception Point. I hope it's better."
3,Brown's First Page Turner,"Lovers David and Susan awake one morning and are sent on separate life-threatening missions with the same purpose: Locate the cause of the worms in National Security Agency's computer, the world's largest, and debug it. The plot, structure, and characters are typical Dan Brown, with page-turning twists and surprises. Those who have read his other novels will feel immense familiarity with ""Digital Fortress.""This is Brown's first novel, and in some ways in shows. Fearful of losing his reader, there are many redundancies and hyper-explanations. Many of the revelations are already known by any intelligent soul. It is not as taut as ""Angels & Demons"" or the ""D'Vinci Code."" but change the theme (computers) and characters, and you have the same type of compelling novel that keeps the pages flying. Recommended."
2,Not very good.,I thought this book would be a good thriller and for a while it was.The author has constructed the book using a series of 2 or3 page chapters .The chapters jump from character to character with each chapter having a suspensfull ending.This system works for a while but after a while this gets a bit dull and there is very little character development. The book gets boring and eventually I didn't care about any of the characters or how the book ended.The book started on a high note but quickly went down hill.
1,BAD book,"I would put down ""No Stars"" as I thought the book was that poorly written. If someone gives you this book to read, GIVE IT BACK. Slow char development, it does not move smoothly through the book, clumsy writting. I thought I was reading a book written by a romance novelist and had to check three times that it was actually a man that had written the book."
2,Doesn't live up to his other books,"There are many, many problems with this book. So many, in fact, that I can't recommend you spend time reading the book. Here is my list:* The technical facts are just plain wrong in many places. They are so wrong, in fact, that if you are a software engineer by trade, you may be insulted. The details about cryptography, security, etc., read like they were written by someone who is a technical illiterate.* The plot is embarrassingly thin and predicable. Sure, there are a few twists and surprises, as youw would expect in a DB book, but overall, I guessed every major plot move before it happened. Very different from past books.* The characters aren't developed to any extent. They are two-dimensional with ridiculous sounding names and cardboard personalities. They make the book read like a made-for-TV movie.DB can and has done better work than this. Here's hoping that he returns to his prior form. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this one."
3,"Fast Read, Good Story, Thin on Technicals","Let me say that I (as some others did) received an e-mail from author Dan Brown about reading this book and doing a review. Well, I finally am getting around to it, and I must say it is an incredibly fast read with acompelling story, but a little short on some of the technical aspects. I'm not a technical person, but even some of the descriptions (especially describing the hacker attack) seemed lacking and forced into a made-for-the movies scene. And thats a shame because the REAL character here is TRANSLTR - the super-decrypting computer! The other characters are rather shadowy - I never felt much for them, and almost found myself wanting David Becker to die as he had dodged far too many tight situations. But.... as I said, I enjoyed the book for what it is and would recommend it for lovers of the genre for the subject matter, if not for the details."
1,A waste of time and your money,"This book is really an insult to those who has a brain. What can I say? I definitely would not buy into the author's the other hype: the ""D.V. Code"".The plot in this story is so dull and plain, you almost predict it from the beginning: when Susan Fletcher (the main character) over and over agin mentioned at the beginning that there are no ""unbreakable code"", you almost immediately suspect whatever is running in that TRANSLTR machine is just a decoy for ""unbreakable code"", and the true purpose was to implant virus. GUESS WHAT? THAT WAS THE WHOLE PLOT of the book! How disappointed it is!Also, the love story and David Becker's journey in Spain to successfully retrieve the ring was so irrelevant to the plot and so dull, you have to be a real idiot to believe it is remotely possible.Needless to say, as other reviewers pointed out, the mistakes author made regarding computer technology are too many.Save your time and money!"
4,"An enjoyable, yet soemetimes predictable book","I do not read much, but when I do I like to be sure it is something fun. Digital Fortress does this, but lets me down in a way too. The premise of the plot is an excellent one, but the book has way too many flaws. Like most other ""cyber-thrillers"" I've read, the computer technology is grossly overstated and twisted into James Bond like proportions. I began to really care less about the battle over encryption, and instead enjoyed David Beckers tough luck. Reading about this poor guy run circles around a bumbling assassin made the book alone worth my time to read. The characters seem pretty realistic, I could imagine a few people I knew like the ones portrayed. Overall, worth your time to read if you're looking for an enjoyable action novel. I also reccomend William H. Lovejoys ""Back\Slash"" if you enjoy this type of genre."
1,Meh...,"Clearly written for the mass market, it is interesting that Dan Brown still manages to make a book interesting. The language used and the literary devices make a very simplistic book, yet enjoyable. One word of caution: do NOT read if you are a computer person or an InfoSec expert."
1,Worst book ever?,"I had never read anything by Dan Brown before, so I decided to see what the hype is all about, and step in. Man, it was an experience! Never have I seen such a exquisite collection of flat characters and implausible plot turns. I was almost impressed. Well, Constant Reader sums up my opinion pretty well on this page, so I won't wast more time on this book than I already have."
3,Page-turner once it gets going,"The National Security Agency runs into a code that even its previously indomitable code-breaking machine can't crack. Beautiful head cryptographer Susan Fletcher is called in to help, while her fiancé, David Becker, is sent off to Spain to try to find its originator. But, as usual for Brown, all is not as it seems as allies become enemies and enemies become allies.Once it gets doing, it's a page-turner despite the inaccuracies (most notably, there's a computer virus that is apparently capble of infecting custom computers, which is highly unlikely)."
3,and of course she is beautiful,"I could repeat what many have already said about how interesting and thrilling this novel is, but that would be repetative. I will simply say that I gave it less than a perfect review because Brown did the same thing so many authors do..made the female beautiful like that is a prerequisite for being brilliant. Just Once I wish an author would trust his/her audience to judge a character on their depth and not have to make then ""Eye turning"" beautiful. It is such a cliche and hurts every book that contains this stock female character. How many booms ahve you read where the female co-star walks into a restaurant and all eyes turn to gawk at her beauty. Enough already!"
5,Best Deal,The book was in very good shape and I think this will contribute to my reading spree. Thanks
3,Thinly researched? Why the uproar?,"Dan Brown is a great writer with a knack for suspense, and puts together great stories. With that in mind, I don't understand the uproar over the lack of research in this book. All three of his latest works, which I have enjoyed very much as works of fiction, have been assembled in such a way to create the appearance of truth, but in reality they are just stories. Clever, yes. Fun, yes. Are there mistruths and mistakes? Yes. But they are fiction, as Dan Brown himself claims, and so is ""Digital Fortress"". Anyone who has studied world history or the Catholic Church knows that ""Angels and Demons"" or ""The DaVinci Code"" has just as many holes. It's fiction. ""Digital Fortress"" is no exception. Enjoy this book. It's worth it."
2,cynical,"DIGITAL FORTRESS involves an NSA cryptographer and a professor, also lovers, serparately looking for the key to an ""unbreakable code"". The book is loaded with action and twists, and while some may find it perfect beach fare, it's full of holes and improbabilites. Part of the plot involves an untrained professor being sent on a secret mission by the NSA, and some of the mistakes made by NSA staff seem ridiculous.The book is full of paranoia about the government tapping into our email and other communications. Many people's views on these things have changed since DIGITAL FORTRESS came out in 1998, which lends the book an unfortunate dated quality, as f it had been written in the '60s..... not as good as DA VINCI"
1,How about some research about your subject matter?,"Terrible. No, perhaps it's supposed to be funny. The factual errors alone are distracting for anyone who has any knowledge about the intelligence community (or anyone who has an IQ above 100) If ignorance is bliss, then this book is downright giddy."
2,Innaccurate and hackneyed but entertaining,"With errors an eagle-eyed editor should have caught (like a silencer on a revolver or a man described as vulnerable due to the noise his scooter made although his pursuer was deaf), plus descriptions of practices in the tech world at which techies (like me) can only groan (the last time I've dimmed a monitor, it said VT-220 on it; I power off my monitor to my pc or let the screen saver do the work for me.) Still, a good story. All in all, a 'beach' book that will keep you entertained but not too engaged."
2,Digital? Possibly. Fortress? No.,"Because I had been fovorably impressed, but not swept over, by Dan Brown's 'The Da Vinci Code', and because I am an amateur, very amateurish cryptography buff, I bought 'Digital Fortress'. One of the positive traits I had found in DVC was, in a general way, the considerable efforts invested by D. Brown in research. Whereas in Digital Fortress, the inaccuracy that borders on flippancy, of most of the cryptographic information displayed in the book cannot be the result of serious research. Of course, this is first and foremost a work of fiction. I do not expect it to be a treatise on cryptography. But an acceptable compromise could have been attained. In my modest opinion, it wasn't. So read it for fun, but just so."
2,"""Thriller"" genre","I did finish the book but I don't know why.It reminds me of a ""B"" movie script that was later novelized by a hack writer.But tastes differ - if you enjoy the first few chapters then you might enjoy it more than I did."
2,Two and a Half Stars,"Not nearly as good as The Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons. It is very predictable and full of stock characters. It's not terrible and you could certaintly do worse, but a disappointment after reading The Da Vinci Code."
1,This Is an Okay Book,"Well, this is the first Dan Brown book I have read. It wasn't all that I expected it to be. I thought I was going to be riveted and filled with anticipation, but I wasn't. The plot is interesting, but the storyline was dry. It was unrealistic. The book is about a beautiful cryptographer name Susan Fletcher. She works for the NSA, creating the ultimate computer, TRANSLTR. TRANSLTR can read people's email without them knowing and decode encrypted messages in no more than three hours. Ensei Tankado, a Japanese computer genious, did not like the idea of the U.S.A government invading people's privacy. He decided to create a computer software that gives people the power to hack the NSA. It is up to Susan and the NSA to stop Ensei Tankado, but Ensei is killed."
3,Less than Da Vinci Code,"I read this book after reading Da Vinci Code (which is one of the most entertaining book I have read in recent years), and I must say that Digital Fortress doesn't come close. Not by a mile. Understandably, this is one of Brown's earlier works. But the bottom line is this book lacks the complexities and element of surprise (and profounding plot) found in Da Vinci Code."
5,Better than Da Vinci Code,I don't understand why people are panning this book. I thought it was great. Far better than Deception Point and I actually enjoyed it more than Da Vinci Code. I'm not a computer tech person so maybe I missed some of the incorrect parts of the story. However the book was incredibly fast paced and extremely difficult to put down. Highly enjoyable.
1,Unbelievable!,"This was my introduction to Dan Brown and oh my gosh, what a disappointment! It was like amateur thriller meets Harlequin/Mills and Boon! Interesting and promising plot but too contrived. Cliched, hackneyed dialogue, melodramatic lines like ""I will heal your wounds"" (ugh!), one-dimensional characters, and implausible scenarios! I think Brown either wrote this book with a movie offer in mind OR this novel was previously rejected by publishers and then accepted for publication after the success of the Da Vinci Code. Great idea for a book but poor delivery. Got exciting toward the end though - hence it rates a star!"
2,Weak!,"As probably many other readers I was reading Dan Brown books backwards - starting from 'Da Vinci Code' to 'Angels and Demons' and now to this one. And every book amplifies more and more the characteristics of Dan Brown' writing, which is interesting subject, interesting plot, lack of any characters development and wooden writing. I would say that this book has all this with the two latter qualities taken to the extreme. It's so badly written that I fought very hard with myself not to drop it in the middle. In the end it got a little bit more interesting (if you will succeed in not paying attention to all kinds of gaps in the plot). The subject of the novel is computer security and the book has quite a few wrong statements and descriptions, which is disappointing. I would say that the author is far from the expert on this subject. Overall it is by far the weakest book by this writer."
2,bleh...not his best work,"I enjoy Dan Brown's novels for the most part, but this one was a bit predictable, hard to follow and not very interesting. The villain seems forced, the good guy was mediocre, overall not an awesome read."
1,Waste of time and money... with there were 0 stars!!!!,"First of all sorry for my English.I have read Dan Brown's other 3 books and things are getting worse from book to book.This last one was a fairy tale for children... the scenario was so childish and full of holes... I was really pissed off!...Just two of them......spoiler...1. How in the world this super technological NSA's cryptography center did not have one single security light in it!!! Security lights were only in the basement... hahaha... And almost half of the book is inside the dark rooms!!!!2. And how in the world there was not a shutdown mechanism of the ""super computer"" when there was overheating!!! My 700 euro PC has one...Well I can mension about 10-20 more, but as I told you it is a total waste of time!Wish I could give him -5 stars..."
1,forgot to check his math...,"I loved The Da Vinci Code and was not thrilled with any of his other books. But my biggest complaint about this one was the incorrect explanation of a bianary code. Since I am a dork, I attempted to work the code using the explanation provided in the book. Couldn't get it to work, so then I had my fiancee (who went to MIT and is MUCH better at math then I am) look at it. Turns out Mr. Brown apparently can't do math correctly, and neither can his editors. Sorry but at that point I put the book down in disgust. Plus, the story was awful."
3,"Satisfying, but ...","I selected this book also because of a recommendation from Lindsay Tanner's ""Pleasure between the Covers"". It'd easy to read, but tends to drag in places and the ending is fairly predictable. But it certainly was easy to read."
4,Great read for non-techies,I didn't care about the accuracy of the computer jargon as some other readers have complained about. I'm not a computer techie so it really didn't matter to me. The story was fast paced and hard to put down. It was similar in concept to 2012 Airborne Prophesy that focused on wave technology rather than computer based. Both had a strong love interest and both went back and forth on perspective of who was front and center for the chapter. I would recommend it to anyone who is not critical of the accuracy of details and just wants a fun read.
3,Good rainy day read.,"Overall good book by Dan Brown. Almost so faced passed that the characters do not really get a chance to ""flesh out"". It doesn't stall once it gets moving and will keep even the shortest attention span glued to it.While surprising plot turns are the hallmark of a Dan Brown novel you will need to suspend disbelief here more than in his other works.Great read for a lazy rainy day."
2,Not something to remember,"It has its moments but if you have read Da Vinci COde, this is big letdown.Its very predictable too."
1,Too Many Mistakes,"There are just too many mistakes in this book, that the author even made things up against historical facts.Computer technology stuff aside, I have to point out another major mistake the author made:In the novel, at the end, it took the scientists way too long time to figure out that the unlock key is the element mass difference between Urinum 235 and Urinum 238, because the author claimed that both atomic bomb dropped in Japan in 1945 were Urinium bombs.However, the fact is, only the bomb dropped in Hiroshima was Urinium Bomb (on August 6, 1945); The other bomb dropped on August 9, 1945 in Nagasaki, was instead a more advanced Plutunium bomb! Not Urinium bomb at all. This can be easily double checked or verified by simply asking a high school student!I think the book is rushed out to cash in on the author's fame on DVC book, and it indeed showed us how sloppy the process is."
3,Entertaining-if you enjoy the technogeek stuff,"The DaVinci Code was my first exposure to Dan Brown and I looked forward to reading Digital Fortress. His writing combines a great deal of thought provoking ideas and conspiracy theories.Digital Fortress is about a computer genius gone mad. You've heard the story before and this one follows the pattern. However, if you enjoy the technological aspects of the book, you will enjoy the storyline also. It's a fun read and one that will entertain you for a few hours but don't expect anything new."
5,A really fun and enjoyable read!,"This is a great book for those who like techno-thrillers. It is also provides the reader with a lot of interesting facts and background, as far as the NSA is concerned. I also really liked all the information about codes and code breaking. The book is well written and is a real page turner. Every time I put the book down, I found myself wondering when I would be able to return to it, to see what happend next."
1,"It gets a ""1"" because Amazon won't let me give it a zero","This is the only Dan Brown book I've ever read. Actually, I only read half of this one. The story telling is so bad and the characters so wooden, I have no desire to read his other books, including ""The DaVinci Code."" I only got halfway through before the poor characterization, even poorer plot (with its coincidences too big for even really bad fiction), and just plain bad story telling forced me to put it aside. Sorry. I know Dan Brown has become a cultural icon, but he's not for me."
1,"it's so bad, it's actually good in a way","The plot is unrealistic. Characters are 2-D. And don't even get me started on the technological inaccuracies, let just say there are LOTS of them.If you have read other Dan Brown books before you will see it's the same dang formula. How many books can he write about professors and super-smart-super-hot chicks? Does every book have to have a crippled genius and an assasin with a disability?You can tell which one of the good guys is the bad guy after reading 10 pages.In other words, the only reason to read this book is if you read other Dan Brown's books and know your computers pretty well. Reason being - in that case the book goes from plain bad to so idiotic it's actually entertaining."
2,Intelligent idea. Futile story.,"The idea is intelligent, but the books feels like you are going thru a bunch of people having a really bad day. Everything that can go wrong, WILL go wrong in this book.I made it to page 255 but wanted to give it up a 100 pages back. All that keeps me going is the thought that hopefully the conclusion is worth the trouble of wading thru another 250 pages. It's like a cyber soap opera! The author, Dan Brown keeps stretching things. I bought the book because of all the talk about his latest book, The Da Vinci Code. I'm waiting for that book to come out in paperback and so I thought this book will give me an idea of how Mr. Brown writes. Now I'm having second thoughts about The Da Vinci Code. Will it be just as numbing as this one?This book is just another pot boiler. Sheesh!"
3,Good flight reading,"I picked up his book for flight reading, don't even realizing the so commented author of the DaVinci Code wrote it. It was an easy reading, fast paced story, and good mix of action and technology. It was a little farfetched, too many coincidences, and too many obsessive and shallow characters. I had fun and enjoyed reading this book, but I won't read it again. Don't expect much of this book, I didn't not find in it what I have heard of others Brown's books. But if you are up to for easy reading with hackers and lots of dead people, you may enjoy it."
3,don't waste your time,"I read 4 chapters and put it down, disgusted with the Harlequin Romance style of the character portrayals (we need another hero whose ""strong jaw and taut features reminded Susan of carved marble""?)Giving it a second chance, I got through it, but it leaves me feeling cheated. The ""surprises"" were all too obvious beforehand and many of the story's premises fall apart due to the totally wrong beliefs the author has about computers and security. I won't go into most of them; if you don't know any more than the author on these subjects, the book could be an enjoyable read. Just don't take any of his technical descriptions as realistic, and be willing to believe that NSA's best minds would risk compromise of top secret data rather than shut down for a couple hours to purge a computer virus. For that matter, be willing to accept that the NSA would actually have Internet connections to a top-secret database, rather than use the separate classified military networks."
4,Great Book (But you have to be into the subject matter),"This is an enjoyable book. But, it is really about encryption, and if you aren't even remotely interested in that, then don't come close to this book. I took a class on encryption algorithnms in college. So, I was already interested in what digital fortress had to offer. I must say, Dan Brown puts a little too many plot twists and crazy acciedents for me, but it was enjoyable."
2,If you've never read anything on cryptography...,".. you might not be insulted by this one.I made it about 90% through this one, but have decided not to finish it. The information he cites about the NSA and cryptography contain so many flaws as to be laughable. It's *FULL* of *MAJOR* errors that any editor or reviewer with even moderate technical savvy should have flagged before it went to print.And that's too bad, because the basic plotline would scarcely have suffered if he had been more correct in his description.The basic thriller plotline isn't badly done, it's what kept me reading this far, but I stopped because of the idiocies mentioned above and the fact that the characters aren't ""real"" enough to keep me engaged more.I *might* finish it later, but I just have too many books in my queue from authors that write ""smarter"" books."
2,Unbelievable Fluff,"I did get hooked into reading this book, so I give it two stars, for its ""thriller"" nature.The content reads like it is science fiction written by an English major who didn't do enough research into the science part of his fiction (which, of course, it is). The mumbo-jumbo about ""replication strings"" and viruses just wasn't at all convincing. Yes, in sci-fi you need to suspend disbelief but in good sci-fi, that's just for one leap. Every time Brown described the encryption stuff, I just wanted to scream.Then, the characters were one-dimentional, particularly, a couple of the fanatical villains.If you're bored, you might want to read this book. Otherwise, find something more productive to do with your time."
2,Fast Paced but with technical Inaccuracies,"This book is exciting to read and fast paced, although I found the dialog between the characters to be a little flat. That is not a criticism however as this is meant to be a thriller.Problem with this book is that anyone with a background in cryptography or having studied computer sciencde will notice plenty of technical errors for example saying that a 64 bit key has 64 characters (ok yes binary characters).Other improbabilities are a 2BN machine that is cooled by a freon system that does not have an interlock to shut the machine down if the cooling should fail. You get those kind of interlocks on your $40 microwave door switch.Anyway, overall still a fun read."
2,"Get ""The Minerva Virus"" Instead","If you are looking for a GOOD sotry about computer technologies that doesn't fall off a cliff, then ""Digital Fortress"" is not what you want to read.This book is a major let-down. Good beginning that just deteriorates into garbage.I did, however, just finish a GREAT book that is a true New Age Cyber-Terror Tale. Much more enjoyable, I suggest checking out ""The Minerva Virus"" before you waste your time with this one."
1,A book full of errors. A waste of time and money,"The author shows such ignorance in math, computing, the NSA, geography and history that makes you think about how unreliable are his books. Didn't he learn that an author must document himself?His description of Spain is ridiculous, an insult to anybody's intelligence, and of course to the Spaniards. Not only he has never been to Spain, he has never read anything about Spain or Europe. He confuses Spain in the 1990s with Mexico in the 1860s.I wonder if he cannot afford some Cable TV (Discovery Channel will do) and learn a little more about the World, Europe and Spain.I'm not asking him to read, too tough for him."
2,Digital Fortress,Dan Brown takes really good subject matter and draws it out a little too long. I was exhausted by the time he wrapped up the mystery. Dan we need a few breakthrough events to keep us engaged.
1,awful. the dregs of awful. the awful dripping of the dregs of awful.,"this book will annoy you greatly if you know anything about* computers* programming* cryptography* cryptanalysis* math* the way secret agencies workand by saying 'anything about math', I mean to the level that you can count past 5 without moving your lips OR without using fingers.I have not one single positive thing to say about this book and I have trouble understanding anyone who can."
5,Surprised at the negative reviews,"I love this book. Well it`s not as good as Angels and Demons or the Da Vinci Code, those are unfair expectations. Dan Brown wrote Digital Fortress before those two, so it makes sense that it isn`t as good, but still, this a super exciting book that I finished in one sitting because it was so great. It has all the plot twists and great storytelling of Dan Brown`s 4 other great books."
1,"Lord, this is awful","Between the stereotyped characters, the clunky narration, the errors in technical fact, and the lack of any sense of suspense there is much not to like here. The quality of the narration does not, unfortunately, do enough to redeem the material."
3,"Entertaining read, but misses something....","Obiously, this is not Brown's best, I would rather say it is his worse. I would call this book an easy to read and entertaining story. Some parts of the plot are ending in a weird fashion and the characters seem too fictive. I could not really feel the emotions of the characters, they are too easily ""written"". Also, their psychological evolution is unrealistic and predictable.However, Brown's writing style is there: the story is filled with action and the novel is divided in numerous, short well-written chapters. If you like Brown's other books and you are looking for a action-filled story for a weekend read, this is for you. Go for Deception Point or Da Vinci Code if this is your first DB novel."
2,Plum gone rotten,"Brown wrote two doppelgangers that copy the structure and style of this book: ""Angels and Demons"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"". And those two were better by far. Once again, Brown writes about a woman who is both a genius and graced with a supermodel's body. Her other half is a very attractive, intelligent professor (they're always professors).The language is a thin butter of overused clichés scraped over too many details of what the characters look like and how they function on a daily basis. The reader isn't allowed to use their imaginations because Brown is too busy nailing down every person, place and thing with exact and dreary verbiage.I'm not a Brown-basher. I enjoyed ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels and Demons"" for their entertainment value. But, perhaps I can only stomach two Brown books before the novelty wears off, and this was the third that pushed me to the brink. Had I read ""The Da Vinci Code"" third, I may be complaining about it instead. But I'm not."
1,Sounds like it was written by a high school kid,"I enjoyed Dan Brown's previous books, but Digital Fortress was a complete waste of time. The basic story could have been good, but the majority of the plot twists and turns were sophomoric, at best. It read like a love-struck high school kid was writing a novel for a composition class. Don't waste your time. Enjoy Angels and Demons, along with The DaVinci Code, and let it go at that."
2,Wow! Interesting and boring at the same time,"The book started out interesting enough. The author started going quickly. After I got further into the book and realized that these characters were very flat and making errors along the way that made no logical sense in the real world, the one question that kept going through my mind was ""Is this book over yet?"". I found myself skipping ahead pages at a time knowing that I am not missing much of anything.I recommend skipping this book. It is a disappointment and does not keep the reader engaged."
1,I am surprised that Dan Brown wrote this,"It is unbelievable that the author od Da Vinci Code can write such a weak novel. It is based on a super computer at NSA which is challenged by an ex employee. There are too many coincidences. Who can believe that deputy director of NSA would dispatch a language professor for a super secret mission. There are technical inaccuracies about computer. It shows how a computer operations manager ignores warnings repeateadly.If I had read this before reading Da Vinci Code, and if I hadn't heard about or seen that movie, I would not have read Da Vinci Code.Like someone said in his comment that he read this novel only because it was by Dan Brown. That is why I finished it too.I have Dan Brown's Deception Point next on my list, but now I am hesitant."
3,"Good but no ""DaVinci Code""","Dan Brown wrote a winner with the DaVinci Code. His other books are not bad but they are not as good. Digital Fortress is very interesting but technical. I found myself skipping some science, wanting to feel about the caracters and their lives. The language is intelligent but it appears a little less technical would have done just fine."
1,Very Disappointed,Wow. I read Angels and Demons and immediately went out and bought this book and was extremely disappointed. I am glad that I read Angels and Demons first or I would never have bought another book by this author.
2,Pedestrian writing mars a by-the-numbers plot,A love story that is nothing less than trite swill. A plot that echoes every Hollywood blockbuster from 'Wargames' on. The material on cryptography is interesting as is some of the stuff regarding the NSA.
4,The little things he gets so wrong really bug me!,"I read Da Vinci Code when everyone else was reading it, then Digital Fortress, now I'm reading Angels and Demons. I enjoy Brown's plot and like his characters (1-dimensional as some people might think they are). Each book has some deeply geeky aspect that very few people have any chance of questioning. I'm not an art historian so I can take a lot of Da Vinci Code at face value and not wince. I'm not a cryptographer so Digital Fortress's esoteric technology is fine. But in Digital Fortress, Brown calls a computer that must be a workstation a ""terminal"" and in Angels and Demons he refers to a cell phone having dial tone. Now I happen to think that dial tone would be a great way for cell phones to indicate that they have service but in my experience, none do that. Didn't anyone edit these books? Geez."
4,Not As Good As Angels & Demons,"I disagree with the previous woman, if you like Dan Brown's writing you will like this book. Its interesting and suspense filled. It will never compare to his best work Angels & Demons but thats not saying much."
1,A Total Waste Of Your Tme,I liked the DVC and even better A&D so I bought this one. Don't make the same mistake. One of the worse books I've ever read. Poor character and plot development. Not a thriller--almost every development was unbelievable and worse uninteresting. . I could continue but I think by now you must have gotten my point!
1,NOT a techno-thriller,"Don't bother with this book if you know anything about encryption or computer security (or the NSA). The author apparently did no background research in the subject. Aside from the lack of technical realism, the story line is simplistic and the alleged thrills overblown, unless exclamation points count for excitement."
1,Unintentional Sexism Ruins An Otherwise Weak Plot,"An cyber-action thriller set within the confines of the NSA, this tale focuses on a beautiful and talented young woman whose rise in the intelligence community is seen with envy and suspicion by her colleagues. When she discovers an unlikely plot, however, she must unravel the complex series of conspiracies in order to save the day... or rather in order for her boyfriend to save the day.Beyond the complete lack of technological understanding shown in this novel, this story suffers from a very sad form of sexism that is latent in Brown's works. The author tries to make for a strong female protagonist, but instead creates a character who is sexy but weak and plays into a stereo-type heroine who needs a man to do the physical stuff.If you would care to read a more indepth review of this and other books, visit: [...]"
3,"Slow start for Dan Brown, but worth reading.","After reading ""The Davinci Code"", ""Angels and Demons"" and ""Deception Point"", I felt this book did not keep the same frantic pace at the beginning. But, it did pick up and once again Dan Brown pulled off a fun read. Brown's books definitely have a common formula but I don't think it detracts from the plot."
2,Disappointing......,"If you are expecting something more engaging such as The Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons from the same author, you are in for a disappointment with Digital Fortress. The main characters of the story are poorly developed and the plot has more loopholes than twists and turns. Several of the scientific and technological details in the book seem hard to believe and poorly researched. But the real letdown of this book is poor style of narration. Overall a very mediocre read."
2,Interesting concept but the story lags,"It started out fast paced but once things start going wrong, it would drag to get to any result. I kept wanting to skip most of the chapter just to get to the point. I really wanted to know what happened to Susan and Dave and the Digital Fortress, but getting there was like pulling teeth."
2,Try his other stuff,"Looks like Dan Brown may be getting Clancyitis -- he had some good books and now he is starting to crank up the factory production. This wasn't nearly as good as the other books by Dan Brown I've read. In particular, try Deception Point.In Digital Fortress, you can see it coming from a mile away. There are very few real twists or suprises, the action is pretty slow, and the ""science"" is hardly new or exciting. Maybe those who are not familiar with computers or security would have an easier time getting shocked or suprised by anything in this book. Save your money, save your time -- read Digital Fortress if you want a good Dan Brown book."
2,Finishing this Book Was Painful,"I won't enumerate the many many many ridiculous ""plot"" points, but it was truly painful to get through. After Divinci Code, this was a major letdown."
3,"OK, but somewhat predictable","It's not a bad read, but many situtations were fairly predicatable. That kind of elimated some of the suspense."
3,Brown wrote like he wanted to get it overwith,"The pace is fast and the plot has an interesting turn or two, but Brown gives those twists away too soon. Also, Brown has a way of having things suddenly occur out of the blue, such as the red duffle bag mysteriously flying through the air to incapacitate the bad guy. If you can get through these bits of ""writer's fatigue"", then the book isn't really a bad read."
3,James Patterson-esque,"This book is not bad. Some interesting ideas and twists. However, some concepts are unrealistic and left me saying, ""come on...that wouldn't really happen"". I did learn a little about US Intelligence, which was nice. That being said, I was really disappointed how close this book was to becoming a love story.I think one would enjoy this book...just do not expect a masterpiece."
3,Great start,"For a first book this is very good. But having read the Da Vinci Code first, this book clearly deserves 1 or 2 stars less. While the plot is a page-turner, it is not very deep and could've been about 100 pages shorter. In the middle of the book the story slows down and adds too many non-key elements. I will still read Brown's other books hoping he only improved from this good start."
5,Kept me up at night reading! ! ! :-),"This book was a pleasure to read. Well written and full of some of the most impressive twists and turns that I almost got dizzy just reading it. I didn't how the book would end until the very end. Well worth the time and money to buy it. Ban Brown has written a book that will take an important place on my bookshelf, right in front, in the middle. A must read for anyone who is even slightly interested in computer security, word/computer puzzles, murder, intrigue, good guys versus bad guys, surprise endings, staying awake at night trying to finish the book in one sitting or maybe your just somebody who really likes to read a good book now and then. My final take is this: Grab a Coca Latte, a comfortable couch, this book and settle in for a wild ride. ----> P. Hannum"
4,Digtal Fortress,"There is something for everyone in this book. A page turner, read it in two sittings (I was on vacation). The technical descriptions are understandable and not overwhelming. Plenty of twists and turns."
1,Come On !!!,"If I were Dan Brown, I would covertly buy all copies of Digital Fortress and burn them at my back yard. Digital Fortress is one of the worst techno-thriller books I've ever read. In fact I was so disappointed with this book, that I simply left it in the drawer of my London hotel - maybe someone else would enjoy it (although I highly doubt it).I don't think Dan Brown is a very bad writer. I read Deception Point (a classic airport novel - good pace, interesting twists, passable science) and I'm half way through the Da Vinci Code. But Digital Fortress is completely off the mark. I've managed to guess each and every plot turn, the ""riddles"" are simply bad, and even when remembering that the book was published in 1998, the encryption and web technology covered in the book is laughable and lacks the minimum amount of vision you would expect from a techno writer.In short - don't waste your time here."
1,Unbelievable nonsense,"The book is a total nonsense. However, it will be a good source of amusement to anyone with a minimal background in computer science. You can find a plenty of gems to share with your collegues during lunch breaks, or to keep people awake during a boring technical presentation. Some examples:- You cryptographers know nothing about security- 64 bits are sufficient to store 64 characters- ZIP is an encryption algorithm- Transltr does not care about an algorithm once it guesses the key- a program that DEVELOPED a bug- million bits long encryption keys- etc..."
1,"Awful dreck, publisher should be ashamed","I thoroughly enjoyed The DaVinci Code, so I rather eagerly bought this book, thinking it was new. But in fact, it is an older (1998) attempt at writing about technology that is just dreadful, and should never have made it out of manuscript form without a rigorous edit and rewrite (or two or three). While it is nice to realize how much Dan Brown has grown as a writer, I simply felt ripped off by the publisher. Absurd dialog, absurd plot replete with not-believable characters with about as much appeal as old carpet remnants. Clearly this was rushed into publication to capitalize on the success and fame of The DaVinci Code but for goodness sake, couldn't the publisher have run it through the editorial mill? I'd send my copy back to the publisher but paying for the postage would be throwing good money after bad."
3,not his best work,"I have already read Browns two better-known books, The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. They did not disappoint - with the exception of the Nancy Drew/Hardy Boy ""perfect"" heros and heroines, the plots were fascinating and the books were real pageturners.However, this book was disappointing in that (1)the lead characters were extra-specially gorgeous, perfect and infallible and (2) it seems that the author let his own opinions on the availability of private communication data to the government be known over and over. However I would certainly read him again, though I cannot really recommend this book."
1,"Outdated, dumb and wrong on the facts","As a fan of DVC and Dan Brown's other works, I was hopeful that this would be a hidden gem. Boy was I disappointed. Had I read this five years ago, I might have been more impressed -- I wouldn't have known the depth of plot devices' ignorance and silliness. I cannot recommend this read. Stick with Angels & Devils and DVC.Deception Point isn't bad. Better than this one."
1,NO stars but I could not publish the review without a star!,"I ordered the book as a gift....NEVER GOT IT....wrote to the vendor, and heard from the vendor with back and forth e-mails. Asked for a full refund and HAVE NOT RECEIVED it! Will NOT do business with these people again!"
1,Shockingly bad!,This novel is a stinker! The characters are quite similar to those in his other novels... and they must easily be the dumbest people with high IQs. The poor ending caps off a disappointingly weak novel.A definite miss for anyone technically adept enough to use a toaster and can count to 4.
1,Worst novel I have ever read!,"Although based on an intelligent premise, ""Digital Fortress"" is full of bad dialogue, unlikely plot twists and dodgy computer science. The finale is written in breathless style as the protagonists struggle to make sense of a vital clue in order to unlock the code and prevent total disaster. Most readers will have glanced at the clue and worked out the answer in a matter of seconds - but the cast of characters (encryption experts and code jockeys all) almost manage to get it wrong, apparently because they can't read a set of google search results..Bah! Read it on a plane, had no choice. My real rating is NO stars, but the lowest you can give is one."
1,awful book by writer whose other works are awesome,"I love Dan Brown's other books and I couldn't believe how bad this one was. Clearly the publisher is capitalizing on readers like me who have high expectations based on Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons and Deception Point. The dialogue was bad, the characters were unlikeable and the plot progression was ridiculous. I kept reading thinking this book couldn't possibly end without a good twist or some redeeming feature. But it did."
5,I was very suprised!,"The plot is simple, yet exciting (thanks to the well formulated series of technical backdrops). The reading is fast-paced. The computer (database/virus/NSA/virus filters/worms) descriptions are truly entertaining! Overall, I'am very satisfied with Digital Fortress; I'am looking forward to a fun-filled future reading Dan Brown's novels."
3,Okay,"all the information provided by Brown is superb--how our government keeps tabs on our personal information, our e-mail, phone calls, instant messeges, etc. starts off very promisingly, but the finale is just too drawn out. worth reading, but don't fret if you never get a chance to."
4,A FAST-PACED ENTERTAINER!,"Regardless of the fact that this is Dan Brown's debut, there are all the ingredients of a classic cyber-thriller in it. A damn good pace, lots of info about encryptions , codes and so forth. U will love its twists and turns which are really unexpected and satisfying. Frankly, a taut barn-burner of a book!!!"
5,A Blast Adventure Through Cyberspace,"I read digital fortress a long time ago but I recently just ordered the new edition on Audio CD. I can't wait. Because Dan Brown does such a great job at explaining the way encryption works and helping the reader to understand the war our Government plays in cyberspace, but in such a way that it fells like a discovery and a learning experience. I can feel my brain expanding! This Novel is great fun and I highly recommend it to any reader enjoys a good geo-politial techno thriller.Devil's Verse: Natasha Azshatan Unlocks Ancient Mysteries, Reveals Secrets, And Wrestles With Demons As She Fights To Stay AliveThe Lost SymbolThe Paris Vendetta: A Novel (Cotton Malone)"
2,Too many weak bytes,"Dan Brown has failed to live up to his standard in this one. The storyline is weak, the coincidences too choreographed, the characters too diabolical ... Overall, the story is great in parts but the key and critical areas are seriously flawed:- TRANSLATR is melting down and there is no emergency response method triggered? Only 3 people know about the condition? Apparently fire codes don't apply to a $2BB investment.- Chatrukian's body short circuits TRANSLATR, and there is no automatic shut-off? Heck, if my toaster overheats, the MCG trips off!- The ""Virtual Reality' view of system security shields 'thinning' as attackers approach the database is extremely childish. Shrek was more believable.If you like combinations of cliched images threaded together with verbose verbiage, this one is for you."
2,"To be read fast, with little effort & without much scrunity","If you are looking for a little escape with minimum brain exertion, then this book is for you. I read it when I was sick and couldn't concentrate on a more serious literature. The National Security Agency has to figure out how to break an unbreakable code in order to prevent the USA's classified intelligence from being revealed to the entire world. The plot was engaging if you are willing to overlook some errors in facts and logic. One has to remember that this book is a suspense mystery, that is, a fiction, so nobody expects the facts in the book to be true. The book is designed to be read fast, with little effort and without close scrutiny."
2,Can't get past the most egregious error,"I wonder if anyone else felt as I did. The main charachter, Langdon, a professor at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, had never heard of the NSA. There isn't a human being over the age of 12 living in the washington metro area who has not heard of the National Security Administration, but a learned professor from Georgetown has not!. I couldn't read beyond that ridiculous lapse."
2,Painful to read,"There were clues scattered throughout this novel and the NSA folks just didn't get them! I just wanted to shake them and say ""look dummy!"" I sure hope the NSA does not employ people like the ones in the novel. We'd be doomed!"
2,Tofu tastes better...,"This is my first Dan Brown book, and it made me wonder what the hype is all about. The story is only mildly engaging, with plenty of mistakes and blunders along the way. The astonishing number of cliffhangers paraded through this book made the story seem poorly thought out. I knew by the median page who the real villain was and his motivations. I knew by page fifty that Dan Brown didn't really know what he was talking about. Still, because it was recommended to me by family, I persisted with the book. I would recommend it to high schoolers; it exists at about that level of complexity. Any one else, read if you have plenty of leisure time and don't want to have to think beyond your nose."
2,Not usual Dan Brown,"I read ""Da Vinci Code"" loaned from a friend and was totally mesmerized by the new facts and startling secrets revelead therein. It lead me to buy Angels & Demons which I couldn't keep down till I read the last page (Yes in one sitting !!). I read Deception Point and which sounded to me quite predictable by that time. I hunted for the 4th novel and finally got my hands on Digital Fortress.Digital Fortress is based on very good facts, however that's the end. It lacks the usual Dan Brown style. It turns out that the unbreakable cypto code developed by the ex NSA employee is nothing but a computer virus. And it turns out the super intelligent female crypto expert is infact not very intelligent after all.Disappoints me. I would still rate ""Angels & Demons"" as best book so far by Dan Brown.Harish Garg"
2,Disappointing Read,"I don't think it's fair to give it a total trash review as some have written because the topic is provocative and it is technically well-written. But it lacks plausibility and good character development which are two must-haves for my taste. DB's books ""Angels & Demons"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"" had an effect of taking a person's entire paradigm of thought on a topic and putting it into a whirlwind of intriguing ""what ifs?"". This book did not come close to achieving that effect. Very disappointing."
2,An imperfect waste of time,"It's possible Dan Brown knows something about cryptography and computing. If so, he should have used that knowledge instead of cramming this book with endless errors and disinformation. A catalog of the book's technical blunders would be nearly as long as the book itself.It's possible Dan Brown knows how to write original prose. If so, he should have done that instead of hacking together this pastiche of techno-thriller and romance novel.And yet I kept turning the pages. Maybe I'm a sucker for wanting to know how plots turn out or maybe -- but not very likely -- there's a little something here."
1,fine 'til the end...,"A well-written thriller with a clever and original premise, it captured me and I read it through in a single day. Imagine my disappointment, indeed anger, at the incredibly stupid ending.I suppose etiqutte prohibits my revealing it but it both denies history and denies science. It was equivalent to a premise that, contrary to popular belief, FDR wasn't actually the president during the Second World War. I just couldn't beleive that Brown actually used this mindless device to end an otherwise enjoyable book."
2,Dont read this book - Waste of time,"After DaVinci Code I had become great fan of Dan Brown and was on a reading marathon to complete all of his publications. The expectations were high and were met decently enough for Angles and Demons but this book did not. Beleive me, half way through the book you can easily realize how the plot was to end. NOT WORTH IT."
3,A Good Effort....,"Others have panned this book for it's content and lack of realistic data. It is Fiction you know. And the manuscript was penned in 1998 so to compare the work to his others may be a bit out of construct. In addition some of the detail regarding the Super Computer and the 'Crypto' files is dated as well.I enjoyed the characters, although I felt that some of the responses and reactions by David Becker were below the intelligence level of a Professor and Educator.Is it on par with DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons? No, but it was a good read (or in my case a listen) and the twists so add a sense of surprise during the climax.I enjoyed it and hope to see more from Dan Brown in the future."
3,"Enjoyable, but not on par with other works","Like many readers, I picked up ""Digital Fortress"" after reading ""The Da Vinci Code"". This was Brown's first novel, and you can certainly appreciate how far along he has come in his art. I found the plot to be enjoyable, if you can overlook some of the technical issues that have been brought up by other reviewers--it is, after all, fiction. But the plot and characters are nowhere as tight as they were in ""Da Vinci"", and I found the ending of the novel to be a bit of a letdown. If you ignore the success of ""Da Vinci"", however, and just consider this book as part of the technical thriller genre, then it's a decent book but nothing memorable."
3,I've read better...,"... and I've read worse. I found this an interesting book with things that I liked and things I didn't.I liked the pace, it was really difficult to stop reading! Alternating the action between two or three places with short chapters helped a lot.I didn't like the fact that Mr. Brown didn't check some of his facts. For example, at some point he calls the German Enigma machine ""a 2 ton monster"" when in fact these machines were quite portable and ressembled a typewriter.I won't go into the technical details, I think they annoyed me because I'm a software engineer.Anyway, interesting and entertaining to read. Let's see how does The DaVinci Code go..."
2,NOT UP TO PAR,"I have read 3 of Dan Brown;s bookd, and thi is by far the worst. The plot is very straightforward and majority of the readers will figure out most of the ending by the halfway point.In addition there is virtually no suspense or the suspense is phony and forced.Skip this one"
1,I want my money back,"I don't generally write reviews, but this book was so bad I felt I had too. The characters are cliché, the plot laughable, the dialogue patronizing and from a technology standpoint, he completely misses the boat. Both the main characters are people so talented and gifted it's impossible to identify with them. They're the perfect people just waiting to be a hero. The dialogue is under researched, reads like buzzword bingo and appeals to external authorities to make his tech analysis without actual understanding of the concepts. If you want to read a good Crypto novel try Cryptonomicon by Neil Stephenson. I am seriously sorry I picked it up."
2,All Wrong,"This book is almost completely factually inaccurate. The math is wrong, the technology is made up, and the author confuses a lot of his terms. It's obvious that some -- perhaps even enough -- research was performed, and it's also obvious that the author understood none of it. Don't. Read. This. Book."
1,Is this for real? Avoid at all costs; not even mildly entertaining,"This is potentially the worst book I have ever read. No matter how you look at it, it is hard to imagine how such pile of nonsense was put together.At times the sheer stupidity of the plot, characters and situations make you smile in wonder. (The book's only entertaining value).One of the novel's action scenes is located in the cramped, deadly steep, badly kept staircase of Seville's Giralda. Needless to say, the best well-known fact about the Giralda is that it does not have an staircase (the moorish king that ordered its construction decided instead on ramps, allegedly so that he could ride his horse to the top). All in all, this is possibly one of the best researched and credible passages in the book. At least he seems to know something about stairs, which is not the case for most other subjects he touches.You can imagine the rest."
3,"Not the best book in the world, but it's ok.","Digital Fortress, by Dan Brown was a fairly good book. The book trys to keep you guessing as to whom the real culprit behind the outrageous scheem is. Key word would be TRYING. The book's ""bad guy"" was blatantly obvious throughout the story.This book could have easily been at the top of it's game, had it's plot been more realistic, the characters given more development. Most of the plot is based on sheer coincidences. Too many coincidences to make it at all believeable. Albeit, the time line was a bit off the wall. An obsurd number of things -that if normal people were to do, would take several days- happened in one long, very drawn out day.Even though, this story drags it's feet and screams out the name of the real foe, it intices you to keep reading 'til the end, just to see if your right."
2,Worst of the series,"I thought this book was terrible. Not because of the supposedly incorrect information, but because of the terrible plot and storyline. The book was terrible! Constant pointless killings helped the plot continue, and a very stupid ending puzzle at the end totally killed the book! Anyone who graduated grom middle school saw this one coming a mile away. Angels and Demons was great, Deception point equally great, and I have not yet read Da Vinci Code. I think Dan Brown should be ashamed for publishing this book."
5,Good Fiction,"Ignore the tech industry folks (he didn't write it as a technical manual for you!). This is a work of F_I_C_T_I_O_N. Look it up.As a work of fiction it is pretty good, and it was his first book (yes, his first. It came before Angels and Demons. It is not meant to be an attempt to 'cash in' on the popularity of 'DaVinci Code' as one reviewer stated).The book works very well for a thriller. If you are a tech industry person, perhaps you should give it a miss, as others seem to think the reseach doesn't live up to reality. But, in order to make a convincing thriller, you sometimes have to be allowed a little artistic licence.I still think 'Digital Fortress' is the best of Dan Brown's novels."
3,Fast Moving,"I'm always surprised to find typographical and/or spelling errors in a mass market paperback. It changes how I ultimately judge a book.Digital Fortress was a very fast read. I like the short chapters and the simplicity with which the author moves from character to character and in and out of settings.I'm not a techie but I am an experienced computer user; however, I didn't quite grasp some of the computer jargon. In some cases the simplicity is taken too far....'oh yes, and by the way, he's dead.'Comic relief, ""Captain, she's gonna blow!"""
5,I couldn't put it down!,"I absolutely enjoyed this book. The story kept me turning the pages wanting to find out what happened next. I like the fact that there were two strong main characters. The pace is frenetic and the story line is interesting. I enjoyed the description of Seville and the chace through that city. If you want a fun, quick read, choose this book! John Kenealy, Author--THE CHALICE"
1,"Hate it, hate it, hate it.","The problem with this book is not so much the technical absurdities, but rather with the strong implication of technical accuracy the author claims in the pages before the book starts.Personal ignorance of computers, encryption, security and normal engineering are all prerequisite for enjoying this book.Again, to all those who think those complaining about technical ""inaccuracies"" are nit-picking; Brown makes the strong implicit claim that he knows what he's talking about. The selling point of the book is that it's a PLAUSIBLE, well researched work of fiction. It is not plausible, it is not well researched; it is a work of fiction.As such it is a very poor 'techno-thriller' with no qualities to appeal to anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of what the book is about. IE National security, computer security, code breaking and writing, etc.The only enjoyment I received from this book was in discussing it's many absurdities with my friends."
5,Code Breaking,"I can't believe this book got an average of 3 stars. It was an excellent book. The topic was an interesting one dealing with code breaking, which most people have no knowledge of, so just that makes it interesting.The book developes it's main charactors right away and then takes off. It's a page turner to the end without a clue to how it will end. It's a great adventure. If you have the last few chapters to read and it's 12midnight, you are guaranteed to stay up to find out the conclusion no matter what time you may have to get up the next day for work or whatever."
1,What a piece of garbage,"I feel offended at the time I wasted reading this. Every single fact in the book is wrong. Everything it says aboutcryptography, computer security and computers in generalis wrong. Even the names of the Japanese characters arenot valid Japanese names! It's all an excuse for a ""racy""plot which is clearly ""made for TV"", things like themain computer burning spectacularly releasing ""poisonous""silicon fumes. Oh, and the twelve-ton Enigma machine! ""Poorlyresearched"" doesn't even start to capture the awfulness ofeverything factual in the book. The rest of the plot andstory is wooden and implausible too, by the way."
1,Short on reality,"I've read three of Dan Brown's books (Digital Fortress, Angels and Demons, and The DaVinci Code). All three have technological flaws that make the stories hard to swallow. In the Digital Fortress at the end of the book, the big problem is preventing all of the Internet hackers from getting into the NSA's massive database with all of the world's secrets. As the security is slowly breached, nobody can figure out how to prevent the hackers from getting in. Anybody think about disconnecting from the Internet? This is a ""national crisis"" so keeping out the good guys is not as important as keeping out the bad guys.The other problem I have with Dan Brown's characters is that they are brilliant in the beginning of the books and then half way through they can't figure out the simpliest problem. This is especially true in Digital Fortress and the DaVinci Code.The stories are fast moving and engrossing as long as you're willing to accept Brown's flawed premises."
3,Another cookie cutter thriller from Dan Brown.,"I read Brown's other books (Angels and Demons, The Da Vinci Code and Deception Point), and liked them all despite many flaws and the fact that they were all incredibly similar in plot development and characterizations. This book was pretty much like those, but I didn't like it as much.There were so many unbelievable situations in this story, including the premise that the book is based on, that they were harder to ignore than in the other books. Brown once again manages to make a ridiculous story readable and entertaining, however, which is why I gave the book 3 stars.I don't know if Brown just doesn't have any other ideas, or if he is just trying to stick with what works, but I really wish I could see a different plot from him. As it is, if he comes out with anything else, I'll make sure to read the reviews first, because if it's anything like his other books, I think I'm about burnt out on the one plot that he has come up with so far."
3,good but TMI,"The book was pretty good, but there was simply too much talk talk talk about computers and computerese. I would have liked a bit more plot."
3,Kind of a rehashing of Brown's other themes...,"I picked up Digital Fortress by Dan Brown, mostly because it was in the house and because I needed a tiny break from ""Literature."" My dad had said that once I started, I would have to read it straight through. This was kind of true. The book was really slow to start out, in my opinion-- especially the sections that followed David Becker. After being led on an endless goosechase through Seville only to coincidentally find what you're looking for? After you've worked so hard at trying to find the ring logically? But oh well. The action sequences that followed were worth a bit of coincidence.I really did appreciate the ""twist,"" mostly because it was both expected and still details of it were surprising. The last 75 pages or so did give me that intense, page-turned feel that my father had described. All in all, not a bad weekend-read, and it has me a little psyched to read The Lost Symbol."
2,Pedestrian writing; Plot holds attention; Characters paper thin;,"I Reiterate:Pedestrian writing; Plot holds attention; Characters paper thin;I finished it out of curiosity, but not interest or appreciation. I just wanted it to end."
4,"great, fast paced read",this was a great book..especially considering it's brown's first...lots of plot twists and real intrigue abound in this one...great characters and plenty of action..a real page turner...definetly worth reading!
2,"OK, just because he wrote a best seller...","I know that you want to discover that Dan Brown wrote novels as great as his Da Vinci Code before he wrote the Da Vinci Code, but it just isn't so. Digital Fortress is a mess, and it makes me upset to see how the author's success with DVC is used to sell it. OK, there's a super computer, and OK, everyone's motives are questionable, but it takes forever to get to the end and at that point I didn't care whether she lived or whether the computer did a China Syndrome. Angels and Demons, while better, is not THAT much bette with hyper planes and non-fatal falls from helicopters.Look, all of us get better with time, and Dan Brown is no different. But don't get sucked into the feeling that you have to like all of his books: this is a stinker."
2,Computer nerds heaven,"Reading this story I realise that I know absolutely nothing about computers beyond the kindergarten stage. If you are deeply into the world and language of computers, you will probably enjoy it more than I did. A top secret US intelligence agency has perfected a super duper, fail-safe code breaking machine which has nevertheless been infiltrated by spies. For most of the book, I had only the barest comprehension of the computer speak and what it was supposed to be doing. If you're not well into the computer business, give this book a miss."
4,"Better, Dan. Much better.","There are a lot of people critiquing this book, and being pretty rough on it, if you ask me. (And I can assure you that if you're reading this, you're asking me. So don't say, ""Well no one asked you."") Though the writing is still a bit choppy like Brown's other books, The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, I think the quality of his writing is a lot more in depth in this one. The characters are more developed, including the secondary characters like ""Hale"" and ""Midge,"" and the code in the end makes up for the slow beginning, especially if you're able to figure it out."
3,DAN BROWN = FORMULA TRASH!,"DAN BROWN = FORMULA TRASH!Don't take any of it seriously. His novels have absolutely nothing new or interesting in the way of religion, computer programming, philosophy, characterization, and novel construction, so why can't I stop reading the damn things.Simply put they're comics written out in pros. Fast paced, ""meanwhile back at the ranch"" old-fashioned western page-turners that grab the reader and run. So for a quick, entertaining summer read do check out this lightest of lightweights, don't take any of it seriously and have a fun.Digital Fortress is the best/worst of the lot. So full of inaccuracies about computer programming as to be laughable and cardboard characters to boot, but at least with no pretensions of theological philosophy like Code or A&D, it moves like a bullet.It's fun and less bad for you than junk food so give it a try."
1,Simply Awful,What was he smoking? This book is simply absurd and overdone. Dan Brown should use all the money he made on DaVinci code and use it to buy back all the copies of this terrible book and burn them. If I could give it zero stars I would.
3,Nice and suspensful; the DaVinci Code it is not,"This is a nice weekend mystery book. It touches upon interesting themes: (1) mysteries of the NSA; (2) supercomputers; (3) cryptography. Since those themes, are somewhat more ""specialized"" than the ones used by Dan Brown in ""the Code"" or in ""Angels and demons"" the book may not appeal to the same audience."
2,Obvious and Simple,"I loved Dan Brown's other three books, but this was a real disappointment. I am in 9th grade, and many books stump me. However, this was too obvious. I figured out the mystery as soon as any clue was given. I was quite upset by the simplistic nature of his first book."
5,Great Book!!,Dan Brown does it again!! I really enjoyed this book - it was suspenseful and interesting til the end!! I highly recommend it.
3,Solid and enjoyable,"Digital Fortress is a much superior book to Brown's overhyped DaVinci Code. It is rocket-paced, technically intriguing, and generally well-written. Brown does have his weaknesses, notably too much foreshadowing and too many coincidences, but those weaknesses don't outweigh his strengths as they did in DaVinci. You may wonder how a professor keeps one step ahead of a professional assasin, but you'll definitely enjoy the ride.Matt Bille"
1,Not worth either the time or money,If I had read this before the DaVinci Code I wouldn't have read that good thriller. A formula rag.
2,Inaccurate,"While I'm a huge fan of Angels and Demons as well as the Da Vinci Code, I found Digital Fortress to be Dan Brown's worst book. Not only is it hard to believe, but his description of Spain and Seville were horribly inaccurate. Having lived there, I know firsthand that Spain is a very modern and well-off country, definitly not a 3rd world nation and not at all like it is described in this book. Also, the computer descriptions are pretty tedious to read and outdated. Skip this one, but his other books are fantastic"
2,Not one of Brown's better titles...,"After having read the Da Vinci Code, my first Dan Brown novel, I expected great things from Digital Fortress. Being a techno-geek, I was attracted to the digital-encryption theme that is the hook of this story. Unfortunately, the characterization is sub-standard. You just don't care what happens to any of these people. The plot is interesting, but unbelievable.Angels and Demons is much better, although Da Vinci Code is probably the best of Brown's lot so far.If you're into techno-thrillers, I would recommend Neil Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, an 1100-page journey through World War II code-breaking, hidden gold, and brilliant characters. It's a marathon read, but highly interesting, and much more believable."
1,Could have been,"This is technically very interesting,but I feel it has too much of the ""gee whizz"" factor about it. None of the characters seem like real people,or am I out of date?"
2,Berglund Center for Internet Studies Review by Jeffrey Barlow,"Unfortunately, I find myself as a reviewer untechnothrilled and far from riveted. There is an common phenomenon in American publishing, where a writer who polishes his craft by writing commercially unsuccessful pieces finally hits it big, as did Brown with The Da Vinci Code, and his publishers gleefully exploit their rights to his early books and plaster the market with them. That appears to be the case with this book. In addition to being just too dated to tell us much about the Internet, the plot is so muddled and the characters so one-dimensional that I find it difficult even to summarize the work... Throughout, I learned little except that the NSA has a lot of computers and apparently doesn't do a very good job of assessing the honesty or even sanity of its employees, both major and minor...For a full review see Interface, Volume 4, Issue 1."
1,Beyond bad research,"One reviewer mentioned bad research; well that is an understatement. Did the author really refer to X11 as ""X-eleven""? Well, yes, several times. It made me wonder if the extent of his research was done verbally in a bar. His ""X-eleven"" veneer of knowledge seemed to apply to every technical aspect of this book.The only good thing I can say about my experience reading this book was that it was better than reading the in-flight magazine between SF and NY."
3,Brown's least enjoyable novel,Not up to Brown's par. To be fair this was written in 1998 and I read it in 3/04. The computer references are dated relative to now. Plus I get the sneaking feeling that Brown is writing about material that he is not entirely comfortable with. Nonetheless a good plot and a good book.
2,Showed potential of things to come,"This book is probably one of the most disappointing that I've ever read. After The Da Vinci Code, I was expecting a lot from this book. Even after reading the synopsis and the first couple of chapters I was still expecting a great read. Instead, what I received was mindless and ridiculous.Note, I know very little about computers and encryption, but I found the underlying story to be decently believable. However, some of the issues about which these characters struggle are so obvious that it makes these seemingly intelligent characters seem stupid (especially during the ending).Overall, an semi-entertaining read but one that was more frustrating then satisfying."
1,"Fast Read, Too Formula, Little Tech","Although the book is an amazingly fast read, it just helps finish the book quicker. The story of the internal NSA conspiracy and the adventures of David Becker in Spain, are completely formula based. The whole idea of ""impending doom"" upon the intelligence agency, with the only hope being within a school teacher, who also happens to be engaged to the ""stunning, intelligent, and perfect"" NSA cryptology director, seems all to coincidental. Finally, the ""action"" scenes that take place within the NSA building are just too hokey. All in all, read the book if you're not in the mood for somethine along the lines of literary merit, and wait for the movie."
2,Ouch.,"This book is for you if you believe:A beautiful 170 IQ cryptographer can't subtract 235 from 238.Technology explained clearly is better than technology explained correctly.Amazing coincidences typically happen continuously.Despite enjoying his other works, reading ""Digital Fortress"" was the morbid watching of a trainwreck."
1,"so sad, when you read something that it is so far from reality..","well..what I could say...I am a I.T consultant and I am from Spain, and I have been in the beautiful Seville, too many times, that when I read that this autor have been writing this novel -I have read el codigo Da Vinci before reading this - the first thought was: cool, I am going to read the book of the year. Not only the topic is computers but also, it is in Seville!! ok... but now the only idea that I have from Dan Brown is that he has not documented anything about this novel, and the question that I have on mind is :have you ever been in Seville?, well I know that the answer is NOT, and that you have written a novel with a lack of knowledge about this beautiful city. From now, I will think twice about reading another novel from this autor. I really liked el codigo da vince and angeles y demonios, but this novel...sucks. Really..."
1,Shallow and Uuauthentic,Characters are not credible.No evidence of serious research.Plot is much too far-fetched. The action scenes become more andmore ridiculous as the book goes on.
3,Digital Fortress,"If it's true that this is his first novel then he's gotten better the more he writes. The story was weak, but Dan Brown has a real talent for keeping you interested even if your not keen on the story.I would definitely recommend his books ""Angels and Demons"" and ""The Davinci Code"", but this one I would say rent from the library don't buy it."
3,"Mediocre, but fun","I like techno-thrillers from the likes of Robin Cook and Michael Crichton, so I enjoyed this book, and read it as a prelude to The Da Vinci Code.I figured out the ""North Dakota"" connection about a quarter of the way through and knew right away what number was being sought at the end. The book did OK in feeding the left side of my brain, but I got a little weary of the seemingly endless cliffhangers--who could possibly get themselves out of the frying pan and into the fire THAT many times, even in fiction??!?!?!BTW, can anyone give me a hint about how to decipher the code at the end of the book? I'm wracking my brain, but nothing about the story I just read comes to mind as an aid. If you can help without giving too much away, e-mail me: dathaler at cox-dot-net."
2,"No fact, just fiction","If you think that you are going to get some intellectual stimulation from this book, don't bother. The scenarios are very poorly coordinated with reality, and though some ex-NSA employees were consulted in the making of this book, I think that it was simply to gather some techno catch-words. Nothing beyond that is real. In fact, parts of the book were in very poor taste - It would have been rated R if it were a movie. But if you can get past the absurdity of the technology aspects, it was a captivating story, though somewhat predictable."
1,Incredibly inaccurate in so many ways....,"It's bad enough that this book seems to have been written by someone who has never seen a computer, much less understands such infosec concepts as viruses, cryptology, and programming. But even common intelligence community subjects are beyond his grasp (he claims that there is a single database that holds ALL of the countries secrets... and this database is accessible via dialup connection throughout the world... are you kidding me??) This book is an insult to anyone who ever took a class in PowerPoint. If you are a complete computer neophyte however, I still wouldn't recommend this book. As difficult as it was to get beyond the countless inaccuracies, once I did, the book was dry, and the whole concept was ludicrous. I can't recommend this book to anyone, the Wizard of Oz is more technically accurate that the drivel this guy spewed."
2,Dont know..,I loved the suspense feel of the story in the beginning but I think as soon as I found out who the real culprit was in this story which is about half way into the book it got boring fast and I found myself reading the rest just to finish the book. The remaining pages are to me trying to fill a book quota. It was drawn out and didnt work. Both main characters seriously are forgettable.
5,A good Dan Brown,"Bull's Eye.I just loved it.For those fond of puzzles, crytography-thrillers and IS. Dan Brown can do more than just religious-tied riddles. He's also good in Information Technology"
3,Typical Dan Brown...,"I am no tech so I cannot vouch for whether the information in this book was accurate. I wanted something mind-numbingly entertaining, and Dan Brown's books always deliver on this front. I've read his other books (""Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels and Demons"") and found this one quite similar. I have to read Dan Brown no more frequently than every 2 years. There is always a hot guy who is just incredibly smart. Then there is an even hotter and smarter chick whose legs every man likes to ogle. Together, this pair has got to overcome some incredible circumstance to create a farfetched plot for a book.A typical Dan Brown book. Very fast-paced and entertaining if you don't think about things too much!"
1,A lack of research and an insult to intelligence,"The book is dull, full of false cliches and loaded with wrong information. If the people at the NSA are that intelligent, we are heading for a disaster. The characters are coming from a third rate story and behaves like kids in kindergarden. As you read along, you keep asking yourself : ""Can they be that stupid?"" IF Susan Fletcher has IQ of 170 then we are all geniuses and the IQ system is flawed.Mr Brown should check his sources and respect his readers by doing some research. As you read the book, you would think that Spain is a third world country with very poor medical system and where everything is dirty. It is rather offending and makes you want to scream at this display of cultural ignorance and blind stupidity.But it is not the first book where one notices a lack of accuracy and strong bias towards cliches and preconveived ideasDon't waste your time and money. An tell your friends, we are the victims of publicity and they think we are fools."
2,A Real Comedown,"Having read The Davinci Code and having been fascinated by the research, I wanted to read other works by this author. This is the first of his books, chronologically, and when it is compared to his other work, is found to be the most disappointing. The plot is most predictable and the excitement that exists at the beginning tends to wear thin. As his first published work, it is possible to see how much he has grown as a writer. Although the book is a rapid read, it pales in comparison to his other works."
1,Disappointing,"I greatly enjoyed Angels and Daemons and DaVinci code, but DigitalFortress was disappointing. Being well-versed into technology andcryptography, I found several errors in this book. Calling ZIP an""encryption algorithm"", for example, is not only wrong but misses thepoint.The final moments of the book are completely laughable. The time isrunning out to find the ""kill-code"" and all these PhD and scientist inthe room can't solve a simple riddle.I certainly hope Dan Brown did more research in his latest books."
1,Poor Plot ! Poor Research,"I bought this book after based on the hype surrounding Da vinci Code. Back then the subject matter appeared to be cool and the plot seemed promising.This book falters on many counts1) There is very little of suspense.The author lets you in directly onto all the charecters line of thought .Mostly Its a childs play to guess whats coming up next.2) The technical facts in this book particularly towards the last few chapters are grossly incorrect. Dan brown either hasnt done enough research or does not understand technology3)The end was a major dissapointment too with little left to be relaved.Overall , its not worth your time."
3,Mystery with some excitment,If you like Dan Browns other books you will like this. I was attracted to this book because it had something to do with computers and encryption. There is very little reality from the computer world. After all if he used reality it wouldn't be very exciting. I would of liked it better had he done a little more research in the computer world to create a more realistic picture of computers and technology. It seemed to me he did more character development in this book than any other. This was kind of a nice change.
3,"Abridged CD was interesting, but...","Digital Fortress, the CD, was narrated by Bruce Sabath. Since I haven't read the unabridged version (and haven't read any other reviews of the abridged version), I can't comment whether the editors make a so-so story better or worse by cutting it down. In the abridged version, perhaps the unbelievable occurrences were tempered by the interest I had in the workings (real or imagined) of the ultra-secret NSA and the code-breakers.I wasn't really impressed by the voices of Bruce Sabath. Perhaps he is good for other books, but he was distracting in this one.And did I imagine it, or did Susan's fiance, trying to use the restroom in an airport in Spain, finding the men's room closed and using the ""Dames,"" use the urinal (???).This was not a Da Vinci Code (which is good as a CD book). The short-term entertainment value of Digital Fortress was above average, but it will soon be forgotten."
2,a little too far fetched,"Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched. Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever. I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I :)"
3,Don't they use editors/proofreaders anymore?,"The very first sentence in my edition (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's Griffin) stopped me short: ""They were in the smoky mountains . . . . "" (not ""Smoky Mountains""). Later, Brown refers to them as ""the Smokys"" (not ""Smokies"").Sorry, this is just BAD writing. It distracts the reader from the story. In another place, Brown's character gets just enough change back from taxi fare to make two local calls from the payphone (cheap tipper!). After his second callee hangs up on him, the character is somehow able to call back . . . (where'd the change come from for this THIRD call?). Where are the editors and proof-readers???I was sick, stuck at home, with nothing else to do, so I read on. Not sorry that I did. But glad the book had been passed on to me. It's not the caliber of product I'd like to personally support with hard-earned money of my own."
2,interesting plot but bad details,This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again.
1,Don't waste your time.,"Bad, very bad. I could not finish the book, which is very rare for me.So many problems in the technology and facts. Poor story line."
2,Digital Fortress,I guess I do things backwards. I've read the other Dan Brown books and loved them. I'm glad I didn't read this one first. I thought it was too technical for the average person. I deal with computers on a daily basis but some of this stuff was way over my head. The characters were not as exciting as in his later books. It's a good read if there's nothing else available.
3,Dan Brown's first...,"This is Dan Brown's first novel, and it shows.The thrill and exitement level we got used to during A&D; and ""The DaVinci Code"" isn't fully developed yet.If this is the first Dan Brown book your buying, it's a good choise. You'll see how his writing is developing and refining itself. If it's the third Dan Brown book your buying, you schould consider.I read A&D; and TDC in two days eatch. Now I've been reading for a week, and still ain't finished."
2,Enough said,"Dan Brown describes his hero as having ""sharp green eyes and a wit to match."" Enough said."
3,good first effort,"I read the Da Vinci code first and Angels and Demons second. Compared to these two outstanding works this first effort is average. Be sure to not judge this writer by this first effort, the two I mentioned earlier are 5+ stars, don't miss them. But if you haven't read this one, you can skip it without too much guilt!"
2,"Skillfull author, but he should stick to what he knows.","I must admit I was rather pleased with the general writing style of the author, I imagine he's normally quite good at both telling the story itself, and building characters one cares about.This book was however, a major disapointment. It's not only the most technically flawed book of it's kind I've ever read, but it's failed in every turn it possibly could. The technical flaws are not limited simply to the mathematical nature of cryptography, but the characters he discribes are not at all believable.If you think you'd like this book based on the introduction to the storyline I would rather suggest you pick up a copy of Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson."
5,This is one awesome book,"I have read Digital Fortress two times. I have read many books similar to Digital Fortress such as: Tom Clancy's Net Force and George Orwell's 1984. None of which are as exciting or thrilling as Digital Fortress. Dan Brown should write many more books of this genre and I look forward to reading his latest book, Angels & Demons."
2,readable but deeply flawed,"As far as action books go, this book works but only on a superficial level. The setting is great and the topic is fascinating but his characters are more than wooden they are also ""all"" unlikeable. Just about every character in his book lacks the ability to carry on a persuasive discussion. At just about every turn in the book when a character has to explain a critical event, that character is usually at a loss for words, thinking about something else or hushed up by a superior. With the character unable to explain the critcal event something bad happens or something good doesnt happen. The author uses this tension building formula so much thru out his book it turns just about all his characters into idiots that we end up not even caring about. And believe me, I am not talking two or three times in the book, I am talking two or three times for ""EACH CHARACTER"" in the book. And these character are supposed to be smart?"
3,"Interesting, yet predictable","Dan Brown does a great job of weaving little-known and often shocking realities into a fictional storyline. However, his abilities as a revealer of little-known truths far outweigh his literary prowess. While certainly a very interesting novel delving into the stark realities of privacy in the digital age, I found the plot twists to be rather predictable and even corny. Overall the book is good, but certainly not as compelling as The Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons, and hardly a literary masterpiece. A good choice for light summer reading."
3,Read this one first,"I believe if I hadn't read his other books first, I would have found this story entertaining. Unfortunately, it's just too much like his other work (just a different setting) and therefore feels like deja vu all over again. I'm having a difficult time finishing this one."
2,Just not worth the money... any money.,"I would only read this book if you are stuck in an airport with a HUGE delay ahead of you. It passes the time nicely enough, and you won't get upset about constantly stopping your reading to check your flight plan, go eat, etc. OTHERWISE, it is kind of a let-down. The book's plot was extrememly easy to follow (too easy), each twist was frustrating rather than enticing. I just really didn't care for the characters, the story, or the sequence of events.Each to their own."
2,It's a rehash,"I liked it better the first time I read it. When it was called Deception Point. Same plot theme, same character types, just set in a new location. Therefore, it was incredibly predictable."
2,Digital Fortress,"To many elements stretch believability. NSA computers connnected directly to the internet and sending and receiving external email; cell phones used inside NSA buildings. Other computer items and security items mentioned that just are not done that way.Compared to Tom Clancy novels, where the details are very beleivable and factual, this one did not have a good factual basis. It would seem that the author did not do his research."
4,Very entertaining,"Very good book. Another Dan Brown page turner. I didn't find it as intriguing as DVC and A&D; however, we all assume that there are technological secrets being covered up by our government. The possibility of secrets being covered up by the Vatican that, if released, would unravel Christianity seems more earth shattering to me. Nonetheless, this book was very entertaining. I'm not an encryption wizard, so I guess my relative ignorance in the field allowed me to be entertained!"
3,"Fast-Paced, but Shallow Read","After reading the other three Dan Brown novels, this one was a disappointment. The premise was good, but it became too unbelievable at times. On the other hand, it is a better story than I could ever come up with. I just completed the biggest exam of my life last week and the last thing I wanted to do was start some heavy reading. I wanted to sit and relax in a park and read a fast-paced novel. This book did it for me. Although there are much better novels out there, this book kept me reading until the end and got my mind off other things, thus, fulfilling its purpose as a cheap, paperback fast-paced novel."
2,Better on the outside than inside.,"It is disappointing to be so consistently disappointed in the glowing promises of ""lightning paced thrills"" awaiting me beyond the flyleaf. If real lightning were paced in accordance with the action in this book it would never reach earth. Becker's handy trails of coincidences were about as hard to follow as tracking an elephant through snow while grasping it's tail. And Susan was so predictable so as to be compared with the countless ""cookie cutter"" heroines so prevelant in recent fiction. The rest of the characters followed faithful suit. The only satisfaction I got was returning it to the library and in the fact that I hadn't bought it. My unsolicited advise to the author is, ""Don't give up your regular job."""
5,Worth the read!!,"The story line kept building right up to the last page. I was very impressed with the style of writing. There was a great deal of technology that he explained in a way that did not put one to sleep. It flowed with the story. The characters were well written. Although there was a main character, every character worked to accomplish the task; a team effort. Nice to know that one person does not ""save the world"" type of deal here. Definitely worth picking up and reading it."
3,Wait for the movie,"DIGITAL FORTRESS is a 9 on plot and exposition of the arcane art/science of cryptology, but it is a 3 on dialog and character development. Thus a 6 rating on average. The characters are cardboard at best, on a level with comic book villains and heroes. Their verbal interchange is of a similar quality. However, when Brown writes about cryptology and the real life world that surrounds it, he holds the readers attention securely. There are several first rate literary critics that I can think of that are miserable novelists. Brown, a professor of English at a prestigious institution, seems to suffer from the same affliction. If he could team up with a co-author that is a true ""word spinner"", the combination might result in a long and profitable career as a novelist. Get the book. Read the book. Enjoy the meat but don't expect dessert."
3,Not too bad to rate with star 1 jana,I do agree there is an explicit effort made not to keep the book down before you finish. Jana is prejudised about personal life of hard core technical people. Nothing stops Strathmore to possess Susan since he has not made up of metal. I think Dan Brown has leveraged those personal feelings. But I do agree that around 40 to 50 pages have been written to increase the weight of the book. I would go by the opinion you can read it once.
1,Skip it,"This book is horrid. The action is almost entirely computer-terminology related. Maybe if you only leave your room to go to programming conventions you'll like this, but if you're more of an action fan I'd reccomend the other books. The Da Vinci Code is, of course, excellent."
3,It lacked the thrill,"Ever since Da Vinci Code I expected Dan Brown to thrill me more and more. Unfortunately, this is not one of his best books. Angels and Demons was a lot better than this one. The story is good, but the thrill is missing. If I can recommend one other writer, that would be Simon Cleveland. In my opinion, he is the only one that can stand opposite Mr. Brown with his good writing and exception story telling."
3,fell below my expectation,"For me, the biggest problem with this novel is I can not sympathize with the good guys. The protagonist, Susan, is basically a selfish, arrogant and stupid woman, though the author tries to say the opposite. If you are against the bad guys depicted in the movie Enemy of the State, you are going to dislike her.Her boy friend David is no better, he used money to change clothes with a man to avoid being a target of a killer, knowing pretty well that he put the poor innocent man in life danger. The guy did get killed and what he did wrong was going to church and sitting beside Susan's boy friend.The plot and the rationale behind is questionable(if not ridiculous). I was able to figure out the password before all the NSA experts could (I don't think I could be that smart).Having said all of that, I admit the book is a page-turner. I didn't get bored, just can not root for the heroes depicted in this book."
3,cotton candy thriller,Since so much has already been stated about this book (and most of it seems pretty darn acurate) I'll make my review brief.If you are not overly concerned with technical accuracies or well-drawn believeable characters but like lots of action than this book is for you! However if you are a tad more discrminating in your taste for techno-thrillers try some of the Douglas Preston or Lincoln Child novels. (Or any other authors who factually research their books.) This one is definately pablum for the massess who want a good read without having to strain their brains.
3,A Good First Effort,"I read every Dan Brown book and Digital Fortress is the last one so far. I did like it better than Deception Point, but it pales in comparison to the Langdon novels.In Digital Fortress we are presented a dilemma by a hacker that has hacked into National Securities (NSA) most powerful computer. If the Hacker gets his way electronic destruction will occurr unless the heros can locate the special code that can unlock it and end it's countdown. Problem is the Code is in Spain and there are sabateurs out there doing thier best to make sure the code falls into the wrong hands.The pace of DF was well maintained, the clues were fair, I didn't care for the hoaky dialogue, as well has the 2 dimensional chacters. But over all it was a decent read, just to fluffy for my tastes."
3,"Good, but not Dan Brown's best","I was baffled to see the relatively low ratings for Digital Fortress; I've read Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code, and thoroughly enjoyed both of them. It would follow that Digital Fortress would be just as good, right?Not so fast.The book was well written, but the book just didn't grab me like the other two. The plot seemed dull, comparatively. The characters seemed flat, more like cardboard cutouts than like the vivid characters of Dan Brown's other novels.The ending was predictable.I was not overly impressed, but I wasn't bored with it either. I'm glad I bought the paperback rather than a hardback edition."
2,Not his best effort....,"Its as if all of Brown's weaknesses in his writing are included and magnified. Weak/no character development, thin plot that doesn't make sense when you work backward, cheesy dialogue, gaping holes, lack of pacing/non-stop tension.Its an interesting weekend/vacation read, but could have been developed much better without the constant 100% throttle..."
3,one half genious,"Just like the Davinci Code, I found DF to be a real good read with a great story-line, character development, for well over half the book...then the bottom falls out and we're into chase scenes, hired hit-men and ""only a flesh wound"" to the leading guy, and so on...Through it all I do feel Dan Brown is a talented writer and idea-maker and for whatever reason I'm looking forward to reading more from him."
3,FIRST ATTEMPT APPRECIATED,"This book doesnot reach the standard of the other books by Dan Brown but for his first attempt it is forgivable.There are certain flaws in the plot and some pages are written just to increase the length of the book.The cryptographic information is fine but there are many drab moments in the plot.The ending will interest many as beat the clock scenario unfolds.If you are looking for characterization look elsewhere.It is a book written for chase scene lovers and thrill seekers there is plenty of action and pages keep turning.All this happens in a haphazrd manner.The storyline is not controlled and some twists are predictable.It is not dissapointing but doesn't reach the standard of ""da vinci code"" or the two other books by Dan Brown."
1,"If you are computer literate just a little bit, do not read",As you may have already noticed from the title of this review this is one of the worst techno-thrillers that one could choose for reading and you would be really annoyed of this dilettante writing with regard to the author's knowledge of cryptography and computers. Having in mind the popularity of Dan Brown as one of the best selling authors out there this book is a complete waste of time. Sorry to say. I give this book 1 out 5. Unfortunately there is no 0 star rating.
2,Technical errors too big to ignore,"Tom Clancy and Michael Crichton are known for their engrossing plots backed up by a ton of technical details. Similarly, Dan Brown attempts to add depth to Digital Fortress by adding details about cryptography, the internet, and other technical subjects. The big difference is that, in Brown's case, many of these technical details are incorrect. While this may not prevent everyone from enjoying this novel, the mistakes were too much of a distraction for me to ignore."
1,do not waste your time!,"I have read ""The Davinci Code"" and ""Angels And Demons"", they were both worth a few hours of reading each, especially the first one. The ""Fortress"" is really slow going, except the last few pages. The plot is weak with a lot of questionable technical references. I was ""taken in"" with this book."
4,Solid Outing,"A satisfying outing, especially for a first time. A little lean in the technical areas at times, but first rate plot and characters. Brown will only get better."
1,Pretty sad and predictable,"You could see the plot twists coming from a mile away. I'll admit that it was fairly interesting, but not very plausible. This is the first book from Dan Brown I have read. But, if this is any indication of his capabilities, I believe he will be getting a pass from me. I found his characters to be shallowly developed and predictable. Your mileage however may vary."
1,One of the worst,"The author says it's Spain, Europe. I think that even him can't believe what he is writting about. The research is very poor. Spain - Europe, is nothing at all as the author says it is. I think he is more likely writting about a banana republic. One of the worst book I've ever try to read."
1,Sucks so bad...,"This will be short. Hated this book. Would have given zero stars. Maybe I've read a worse book, but none comes to mind. The characters were wooden and unbelievable, the plot seems constructed by a kindergartner, and the material about computers, cryptography, the NSA is nonsensical, unrealistic, and flat wrong. The text was repetitive and I kept skimming hoping to get to something believable. Never happened. I will definitely never read another Dan Brown book. I've got a REALLY bad book taste in my mouth and I need to read something, anything, to get it out."
3,Amusing - in a comical way,"I would have to say I enjoyed this book. However, I'm not sure I enjoyed it in the way the author intended. I chuckled through the book at the complete lack of knowledge of codes and mathematics, the cliff hanger chapter endings where you could guess what was going to happen, and the total give away of the ""villain"" almost from the very beginning. If you want a fun summer read without much thinking, I suggest this book. If you're looking for a tightly paced thriller or a peak into the actual workings of code breakers and government intelligence agency...this probably is not the place to go.By the way, the computer/math aspects of this book are as completely far-fetched as the religious aspects of Dan Brown's more widely known books, The DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons. Wouldn't it be awesome if programmers and cryptologists staged protests for this book like religious groups protested the other Brown books?"
2,BookWorm,"Ahhh, painful!I engulfed Brown's ""The Lost Symbol"". I expected this one to be just as good. However, three chapters into it, I wanted to jump into the book and slap the characters around because they were so annoying. Everything about this book is annoying. The coincidences are just too many; the characters are predictable. I knew exactly how it will end three chapters into the book! The fact that the professor goes through all those coincidental circumstances is just ridiculous. Also, Brown keeps re-writing the same thing over and over again....I don't know how many times he described TRANSLTR to the reader...at one point, I literally said out loud: ""ok, I get it, move the hell on!"".Maybe this book sucked because it was one of his firsts...not sure. Definitely wouldn't recommend it, because the reader will be disappointed. I liked his ""The Lost Symbol"", ""Angels and Demons"", and the ""Da Vinci Code"". This one literally p****d me off."
1,Made me hate Dan Brown for years,"This book is such absolute drek that I was very reluctant to go near anything by Dan Brown again. I've forgiven him for this turd because I enjoyed the movie ""The DaVinci Code"". While I despise the deliberate spreading of misinformation, I give him artistic license. Artistic license doesn't excuse the stupidity of Digital Fortress though, it reads like a cheap Hollywood formula. The heroine isn't just super-smart, she's also super beautiful and super stylish? Gee super idea, Dan. Also, for a technical thriller, you expect a certain calibre of technical information, which was lacking. If this review saves one person from wasting time and money, it was worth it..."
4,Very Captivating,"There are a lot of negative reviews here... and some validity to them. Being in the IT profession for 13 years, I saw the techno-flaws as did some of the other reviewers... Some were quite comical, for instance; Greg Hale entering modified Fortran commands to interact directly with a running program. But all that aside, I thought the book was well written. I can't wait to read his other books. Good job Dan!"
1,What a waste of dead trees,"This could rank as one of the worst books I've even seem. The author attempts to make some grand statement but it comes out as a palsied whine. The plot is boring, the characters cardboard. He thinks by throwing in some buzzwords he can form a techno-thriller, but it is painfully obvious that he forgot to look up what the words mean. I now understand why it was so hard to find, I wish it had been harder. This is definitely a 'B' grade effort from a 'C' grade author."
1,Not The Agency I Worked For,Suffice it to say that this work of fiction does not provide an accurate portrayal of the National Security Agency.
1,"LOGIC,, WHERE ART THOU?","The NSA is decrypting e-mail messages via the TRANSLTR, a supercomputer. An ex-employee develops a non decryptable encrypting program and puts it out on the web. The key is to be auctioned.High-ranking members of the NSA try to decrypt the program and get themselves in a lot of trouble doing so. There is also the inevitable professor who gets almost framed by The BAD GUY..Unfortunately, there rests one question unanswered: if everybody already has got the program and is just waiting for the key, then what good is the planned action of the NSA? It won't help any.Therefore, this is logically an impossible plot. The characters are equally impossible, motivated by cardboard emotions and lacking intelligence. The moral question involved in uncontrolled mass-decryption rests not only unanswered but is never asked (would you be happy to have your correspondence checked by a bunch of kindergarten cops?)I was waiting for the real plot till the last page and was utterly disappointed."
1,uncharacteristically dull for Brown,"Because I enjoyed Brown's other novels so much, I was thouroughly disapointed with this one. The characters are pathetically uninteresting. Knowing Brown's other work, I assumed the book would start to pick up and get better, but I ultimately gave up by chapter 8. It's just distinctly disapointing and I highly recommend reading any of Brown's novels except this one."
2,Okay for a first effort,"Dan Brown's first effort -- Digital Fortress - was modestly entertaining. Had I not read A&D; and DC, it may have surprised me. Sadly, it did not.<spoiler alert -- stop reading if you haven't read the book>Brown has certainly attached himself to a formula full of predictable plot twists and red herrings. This book was trully obvious from jump street.The whole thing was far-fetched. The part where the virus was taking security down was hilarious. Either security is up or down: there is no visual graphic for it. Why would Hulohut kill Tankada from a distance? Why not do it up close and take what he needed? Furthermore, why would he need to kill people who had NO CLUE as to what they saw? Just a risk that made no sense.I am going to read Deception Point just to finish the body of work. I am hoping for better. With any luck, his 5th book will go down a different path."
3,Only Somewhat Thrilling,"I had high expectations for this book after having read ""The Da Vinci Code"". Those expectations almost immediately faded when I recognized the same plot twists and the same type of characters as in ""The Da Vinci Code"". The only difference is this time they are working on more modern technology. Foreshadowing is used quite a bit as you can tell what is coming a couple of chapters ahead (with chapters of 1-2 pages it's hard not to). As some have written previously, this book is layed out like a screenplay. Yet again, one of the traits that I didn't like is that Dan Brown's books have somewhat lackluster endings. You know what is going to happen due to foreshadowing and by the end when the characters are running around trying to figure out the last clue you are already thinking about what to have for dinner. All-in-all this book was a decent read. I would recommend it to someone who doesn't have much knowledge about computers."
3,"A quick, fun read.","This isn't literature at it's best and I'm not a computer geek so, it was just a quick and entertaining read and then it's on to the next one. Like renting an average movie, it was worth the paperback price for the day of entertainment. Happy New Year."
2,Idiotic,"This book was very disappointing! My friend, who happens to live in Seville, recommended it with rave reviews. But, as I was reading it, the characters and the plot became very unbelievable, if not ridiculous. The main character, supposedly one of the smartest people in the country, came across as totally clueless and extremely slow witted in most situations.Also, the way Brown described the cathedral and the tower of Giralda in Seville was way off! It does not have stairs leading to the top, it has RAMPS! When it was first built they used to ride horses to the top of the cathedral tower, so they built it with ramps instead of stairs, and as you walk up the ramps, it is impossible to see below becauase the middle is not hollow. I know, I walked to the top of it! Look it up on WIKIPEDIA.In any event, the book is a disappointment and I would not recommend it to anyone with an IQ above 95."
1,Painfull and full of holes.,Having read and enjoyed the 'DaVinci Code' I was looking forward to another book by this author. What I found with Digital Fortress was a painfull read full of simplistic plot holes and glaring technical errors. The ending was so bad I felt I had really wasted my time with this book.
1,13 year old figures out code pffft,Well i read the da vinci code...and angels and demons...but this book....At first it went well..action so on so forth....but then you get to the language prof. (forget his name) who speaks perfect german..(although anyone who actually knows german would laugh at this)...although his grammar etc. is completely wrong..... i figured out the code about oh...right when they got the sets of numbers...pffft...it was depressing... a book written by dan brown and a 13 year old cracks code? very disapointing...Brown had the right atitude for the book (letting readers think they were being given a peek into a new and fantastic world) but when i broke the code etc... all of that was gone....the good feeling etc....if the people in the nsa were really that stupid..the usa has no hope <sigh> i just hope his next book is better
3,Definitely can tell...,"...that this is one of his early novels. The character development and plot twists are nowhere near as intricate as in Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code (the first two books of his I read -- and adore). I kept waiting for the big climax of the story, but it never happened. Maybe that's because I was able to figure out who the villian was by page 100. Still, not a bad way to pass a rainy afternoon."
2,Disappointment,"This book was recommended to me by an employee of a local bookseller. I was told the book, would ""draw you in"" and ""keep you in suspense"". I was sorely disappointed.Putting all of my technical gripes aside, I found that the book was surprisingly opaque. I had the story figured out before I had a quarter of the book read. I hoped that I was mistaken and would be surprised with the ending. Unfortunately I was not mistaken.This is not a bad book, it just was not what I was expecting or looking for.If you are technical or insightful, beware... you may be disappointed."
1,"Very disappointed, a waste of time reading","Having only read the Da Vinci Code previous to this book, I had high expectations. I am very disappointed by the reviews, because this book is terrible. How any of this could have actually taken place is beyond imagination. The plot is paper thin and had no credibility from the start.I found the whole premise of this book unbelievable. I may try another book by Dan Brown, but not soon."
1,Bogus and Bad,"This was a howler... Brown is so ignorant about intelligence gathering, computers, and NSA that there was no way to suspend disbelief and just go for the ride. Brown needs to learn to research his storylines, and then he needs to learn to write a lot better (even DaVinci Code suffered from bad writing), and he needs a better editor who will guide him on his way."
1,Inaccurate,"Have Mr. Brown ever been to Spain? If the accuracy of his descriptions and researching depicted on his other novels reaches the standard of what seems his personal view about Spain, most informed readers will realize his work as a whole is of no value at all."
1,Not totally useless...,"This is just plain silly. Technically it doesn't make sense. In fact, the inaccuracies and odd conception the author has of the IT world are nothing short of insulting. You could get away with this kind of techno-babble 20 years ago, but readers are too smart these days to have the wool pulled over their eyes. It has all the feel of a bad high school assignment but all is not lost. With the audio version there are enough disks to provide coasters for a good sized dinner party."
1,"If I could rate it lower, I would...","I'm honestly surprised by the number of people who are reviewing this book in a wildly positive fashion. Frankly, if I were Dan Brown, I'd be mortified that this book is still out there for public perusal. The characters are presented as experts in a highly mathematical field, but when presented with a stupidly obvious puzzle they are left blinking stupidly at each other by simple mathematical concepts like Prime numbers.There are many twists and turns, as others have said, but the premise is flimsy and the results are awkward. All in all, this was NOT a good book."
1,Good Lord! It's Appalling!,"I picked this up as a holiday read... and boy, what complete junk it is. It fails on pretty much every level. It fails as a thriller because it employs every stupid cliché plot device known to man: the good guy is the bad guy; the senior manager is behind it all; the girl is very clever & beautiful but terrifyingly stupid when it comes to closing doors and hatches. It fails as a technology book because it is so moronically poorly researched. The tech component is about 1% reality and 99% made up junk. Soldering mainframe components under the desk? Snigger....Frankly, I'd rather be forced to eat this book than ever read it again. Its easy to see why all the books PRIOR to Da Vinci Code were unsuccessful."
1,Totally predictable,"Maybe I have just read too many thrillers, but I knew exactly what was going to happen long before it did. Toward the end I was yelling at the characters because it was taking them so long to figue things out. It was fast paced certainly but totally predictable."
2,Couldn't Finish This One...,"I have read other books by this author in record time, but I honestly could not finish this book. It does not have the level of suspense of the other books and is not as well written. Read this book of his last (if at all)."
5,sock it to me,i am very satisfied with my socket set and am appreciative of the great price; i would definitely recommend this socket set to anyone whose at least somewhat handy with tools. thanks
5,Mountain Love Songs,"This CD and the two others by this singerare absolutely beautiful. Though thisguy was not born in Hawaii, he sings withhis heart and the songs come across thatway. For those of us from Hawaii but thatlive on the mainland, this collection isso heartwarming and beautiful. It makesme feel like I'm there even though it alsomakes me just a bit homesick. I would definitelyrecommend this CD to those that love Hawaiiand also to those that just appreciate awonderful male voice."
2,Very cheap looking...,"I bought this for my best friend to complete her Christmas gifts, and was severely disappointed once I received it. It is literally just a thin plank of cheap, laminated wood. It doesn't even have hooks or anything on the back with which to hang it up, so I had to add picture hardware to it myself."
2,CUIDADO...,"Cuando en la página web de Amazon tome conocimiento de la existencia de este doble compacto, lo compré, pero cuando mas tarde lo escuche, sentí una decepcion. Si bien las versiones son las originales, hay muchas que no están completas, y han sido ""acortadas"" mediante un efecto de ""fade-out"", como se aprecia en los casos de ""Pobre mi patrón"", al que le han literalmente ""serruchado"" la ultima estrofa, ""Camina siempre adelante"", ""Te llegará una rosa"", y alguna otra. Esto es inexplicable, ya que las versiones completas no llenaban ni por asomo el espacio disponible en cada disco. En resumen, por el resto del material no hay objeciones, pero si se pretende un producto bueno, tengan cuidado con este titulo..."
5,board book,My three year old grand daughter loves this book so much that I have purchased two from you. One for her house and one for mine. definitely one of her most favorite books.
5,A Favorite in this house!,"My 2yr old really loves this book, at one point he carried it around the whole house till I made him a Handy Dandy notebook (with a 4inX4in notepad and construction paper) ... I know this book by memory that's how much I've read it to him lol.It helps us get ready for bed every night, the border did break after a week or two, but its still a 5 star book."
2,Disappointing book,"The cover of this book looked very cute, but the actual text and inside illustrations were somewhat disappointing. It did not captivate me or make me feel that I really wanted to read it to a child as a bedtime story. However, a child who loves Blues Clues might have a different opinion."
5,Great Bedtime book!,"My 18 mo old son had become a Blues Clues addict. He calls them ""coo-clues."" I bought this book for him along with a few others, and this has become the overwhelming favorite. He brings it to me all the time, requesting me to read it. In the book Blue goes through her bedtime routine and my son finds it easy to follow along pointing out to things along the way. He likes this book so much we usually end up reading it several times in a row!"
2,My least favorite book,"I generally love romances and can usually suspend belief in order to get into a book with an unrealistic storyline, but this one just didn't work for me. The star crossed lovers are described as being perfect and brave and so on, but I just thought they were plain dumb. The heroine gets into all kinds of trouble just because she is ridiculously careless. I cringed when Scarlet was sneaking into the underground city all by herself instead of going to get her sheriff father to help, and the dumb stunts just go on and on. The dialogue was the worst I've come across in years and that's saying something because I usually read at least four books a week from different genres. The plot devices were just too convenient, the characters did not ring ""true"", and even the love scenes were a bore.I picked this book up hoping to enjoy a mildly steamy historical romance, but was sorely disappointed. The only redeeming characteristic was that there was no half-naked woman on the cover."
1,Too Thin,"I thought the picture was cute online. So, I decided to purchase it for $15.00. When I got the picture, I noticed that it was super thin and I was really disappointed. I would have sent it back, but I had purchased it for someone else as a gift. I would not recommend purchasing this product. Unless the product price was $5"
4,This product will be very nice to have ...,"This product will be very nice to have around the house come the next cold season. The taste was pleasant. Not very medicinal, but they don't taste like candy, either. The size was just right. It doesn't hurt your mouth because it's too large, but lasts for a few minutes. I like to use Vitamin C to prevent illness and this seems like a great way to do that without the bad taste. Would also feel great on a mildly sore throat."
3,These supplement drops were all right. The taste ...,"These supplement drops were all right. The taste was fine until I got to the center, which had a very sour taste. Probably the vitamins. I didn't notice any change in my overall health, but hey, I'm not sick. I'd say if you need vitamin C this is a good way to get it."
5,I really liked the vitamin C drops. They ...,"I really liked the vitamin C drops. They had a good strawberry flavor and kept the flavor the whole time I had the drop in my mouth. I also felt good about eating them, since the vitamin C makes them good for me too. I've never had any other hard vitamin C drops before, only the chewable kind. These were definitely much better. I'd most definitely buy them and also recommend them to friends and family."
2,She had to pay the bills........,The movie sucked..bette rocked..point blank...! She was awesome as usual adding some star power to an otherwise James Bond wanna-be movie.
1,My Album order never arrived.,"While ordering online, I did not notice that another address in New York was the destination box. I paid by visa then completed the order form. My album ""Soaring with Agamemnon"" was sent to the USA instead of my home address at Armstrong BC, here in Canada. I tracked it to that address and saw the party had moved. I don't know where the item is any more and my $20 is now yours.I was unable to find where to contact you online with this problem subject within your automatic selections. The return items system did not apply.I don't regret my first attempt with Amazon has failed because of my NOT carefully reading the order form. It was my fault entirely. At 73, I should have had more sense.If you can find my album that would be great, if not, well thanks anyhow. I'll order another one from you I suppose."
1,Realistic is about all that was going for this game,the Fun Factor is almost non existent. not worthy of a purchase even at the cheap price it sells for. 2 stars.
3,A very rare Moby release,"The two songs on this CD are pretty good. They are strictly techno tracks similar to Moby's MOVE ep and the dance tracks on EVERYTHING IS WRONG. The only downside to the CD is that the second song..., sounds very much like Emptiness. It is basically a remix, almost the same vocal samples and beats.The artist name Lopez is really an alias that Moby has used. In addition to the Emptiness CD there are other rare Moby cds under aliases that have the same style.They are Lopez ""Why Can't it Stop?"", Voodoo Child ""Higher"", and DJ Cake ""Sugar Baby"". These four cds are the Trophy cd series.This cd is really nothing like the style of music on PLAY. I would only recommend it if you like Moby's earlier stuff or for the diehard Moby fan who needs this to complete his or her Moby collection."
1,Religious book,I was looking for a book that would help me teach golf to my son. Nothing in this book's description tells you that it combines golf instruction with christianity. I would not have bought it had I known. I gave the book one star because I couldn't figure out how to give it less.
2,Religious Bent,"I agree with a prior reviewer. This is the first golf book I have ever encountered with Bible verses. A little strange, but the overall golf teaching concepts appear sound. The author obviously enjoys teaching children and juniors, but clearly views golf as a means to evangelize not only children but others we should encounter on the golf course. I understand this is the authors prerogative, but the book should be more clearly titled."
3,"It blows air, efficiently.","Like it should. Placed it just under my graphics card, and it did a great job. Problem, it's too thick to fit between a g-card and two PCI slots. Now, it makes a great HD cooler. Nothing wrong with that, but that's not what I bought if."
4,love the book,This item came very quickly. I have had no problems with it. Nothing was damaged and it still works. I am happy with this product!
3,excellent!,"This is an excellent book that helped me train my lab, and now she is the best dog I have ever had!"
5,Candid Camera DVD Set,Bought this as a gift and she has really enjoyed it. Got it because I knew it was one of her favorite shows.
3,"repeats,repeats",this is not worth the price half of it is a repeat of the other half so if you buy it youre not off rocker you did just it on another disc.
2,Candid Camera ho hum,"The 5 Decades of Smiles is lots of fun but there are SO many duplicative episodes! Save your self a lot of money and just buy the ""Best of Candid Camera."""
2,Disappointing,"I remember watching several funny clips while the show was a regular broadcast in TV.Hoping to see them again, I spent around $ 100 to buy this DVD set. Unfortunately most of the shows I enjoyed were missing in this package.I was very disappointed. Sold the DVD set back to someone else through Amazon.com's used DVD sale."
2,Okay product,This opener doesn't work as good as I thought it would. It doesn't grasp the jar very well. The teeth that hold the jar are kind of flimsy.
4,jar opener,I like this opener but not as well as the one I previously had which I had moved from house to house as we moved to different houses over the years. It doesn't seem as substantial.
3,room for improvement,"I use it and it has removed all the jar lids I have tried. HOWEVER, I must try very hard to get the lid to ""catch"" in the teeth. The teeth are only one-quarter inch ""deep"" (distance from plastic to teeth). Another one-eighth inch or so would have made this a ""perfect"" product."
1,I guess you get what you pay for...,"This arrived last out of my order. Once installed as directed, it pulled loose and fell off the cabinet within 24 hours. I never got to use it. I will be looking for an alternate installation method."
2,does not work well,"it does not grip well because it only has ""teeth"" on one side. it means having to put a lot of pressure on a jar to get it open. for older people, this is not practical. I have another one that I have had for several years with teeth on both sides and it is very simple to use."
2,mounting hardware,"It would have been nice if they would have included the mounting hardware for the jar opener. Now I have to go find narrow screws that are long enough, but not too long to puncture the cabinet. Now I have to go to Home Depot."
4,REALLY 4.5 STARS,"An excellent book about the essential discipline of flight.I had three minor problems with the book which would not keep me from recommending it to others as a must read. I will focus on these rather than the positives because the other reviewers have done an excellent jobSeveral incidents would benefit from a little more data which would give the reader a better understanding of the situation.I found the discussion of the Ron Brown crash implausable. That a crew with limited experience in ADF flying would not have selected the beacon at the airport which lay ahead and defined the MAP.Finally , a nunber of the incidents are duplications of those in A Darker Shade of Blue. My guess is that there are enough lumps of smoking aluminum around to offer fresh meat for each of the book ie The AA 965.These minor comments aside it is a must read"
1,worst scale ever!!!!,"five seconds after you get a reading, you get a completely different reading, how bad a scale can be!!!"
4,"good price, good delivery,seems to work","i am happy, good price , good delivery time, this is a backup DVD of my windows 7 i have not had to use yet but it seemed like it worked. the package looked like it was roughed up some and the jewel boxes were broken. i use folders anyway so it did not annoy me as it might someone who uses the boxes."
5,Fun spots to take kids in and near Baltimore,"As a mother of two kids under 10 yeard old as well as a newcommer to the Baltimore area, I found this book extremely helpful in finding things to do with my kids. The book is laid out wonderfully.It seaperates activitie into seasons which I found extremely helpful. It also let you in on some ""inside secret"" place to take your kids that cost little or no money. Each activity and place had excellent directions,hours of openings,Phone numbers to get addional information as well as admission costs. I had borrowed this book from a friend and found it so helpful that I bought my own copy! A super and must have resouce good for anyone with children new or old to Baltimore!"
4,A Mixed Bag,"As with all collections you get the good with the bad and this book is no exception. There are some very good stories, some fair stories and some I had to skip all together."
5,Falling love with Julian of Norwich again,"I confess that I have fallen in love with Julian of Norwich again because of this readable and beautiful translation, with its helpful format of daily readings. Visually, Julian's words have been arranged in an insightful, poetic format, creating an open and almost breathable space on every page... space that gently invites the reader into his or her own insights. Reading Julian's experiences through this translation, I have found myself almost holding my breath as my heart and mind have become deeply moved and challenged because I am falling in love with God and Christ again. Thankfully, the format of daily readings allows the needed space to breathe, pause, pray and integrate not only what has happened to Julian but for what also can happen to the reader through her words."
2,A disappointment,"This is a reasonably priced CD of a live recording of a 1959 performance (Italian version), in Vienna. I was expecting a decent re-mastering of the old recording, allowed by the current advanced technology. Unfortunately, this is not the case. From the very beginning, you notice the hollow empty sound quality. The music and the performance of the singers and the orchestra are distorted, to the point of taking out all the pleasure of listening to the this otherwise extremely beautiful opera."
4,Ida,"Ida is getting on, but her music is still from the heart. She seems to enjoy her young friend and they make magic."
2,BORING!,"This must be the most boring book I ever read. You may not believe that statement since, after all, the history of the development of soda is such an exciting topic. Basically, each soda started out the same. Some pharmacy worker developed it and then eventually sold it off to a major corportation. After reading that same story from Dr. Pepper to Fanta you want the book to move on....but it doesn't! Instead you read basically the same boring story for each soda that we know. Another major drawback to the book is that it is so outdated that is not even funny. It seems that 1/3 of the sodas mentioned in the book are not even manufactured any more. The only part that is a little interesting is the ""cola war"" years and that fizzes out quite quickly as well. If you absolutely must read about how carbonated drinks evolved then give the book a shot (I am at a loss for another one to recommend). But do so only if you have a hefty amount of caffeine in your system to keep you awake."
3,Disappointing,"I remember when Hasbro restarted the Star Wars figure line in the mid-1990s. I was really look forward to getting the Tusken Raider because I always thought they looked so majestical in the film. However, I was disappointed with this figure. It just seemed like Hasbro didn't know how to handle the cape. It looks odd and is split down the sides, showing the Tusken's undergarments (he looks like a mummy). Also, he could only hold the gaffi stick in one hand because the other was permanently closed. Fortunately, nearly a decade or so later, Hasbro released theStar Wars 3.75 Vintage Sand People Figure, which is absolutely stunning."
3,Way too small for an Optimus Prime Figure,"The pictures are misleading when I bought this classic Optimus Prime. I was looking for a normal size Transformer, and got a pocket-sized one instead. I mean this thing can fit in your hand almost, convoy included. The only reason i'm keeping it is because it's the classic Optimus Prime, G1. It does have some detail to it, but does that matter when it's so small? If it was bigger it would be perfect. Too expensive for that size too. Only if you're a Transformers Fanatic would I recommend it. Otherwhise save your money."
3,THS-02 Hybrid Transformers G1 Optimus Prime,"Transformer Optimus Prime classic, for the leader of the Autobots. By Takara.This item does not have rate."
3,good but not detailed,"This book is well written and photographs are nice. The author gives you a lot of basics, but doesn't go into detail on some of the areas of auto body work he covers. In his defense he does mention that, but I would have liked to see more info and examples on metal work. For a beginner, this book gives you just enough info to be dangerous with the tools. I feel like I need another book to supplement this one."
2,Where's the beef?,This book was not very good. First of all the there are lot of filler pages. Each chapter has two title pages and a page for notes. There is 5-6 chapters. The first chapter is just about how to keep your shop clean.The book goes from the painfully obvious -don't smoke cigarettes while painting- to vague and incomplete. There is an entire chapter on leading but only a short paragraph about actually melting the lead. Also this guy LOVES bondo.Overall this book felt like a brief overview of paint and body work written to paint and body professionals. Or a few decent magazine articles spread thin to create a book. It does have lot's of nice color pictures
5,great book!,this book helped me so much! I am restoring my 1965 GTO. I am not doing the painting but I am doing the sheet metal.
5,very helpful,"This book is full of helpful hints on restoring an automobile. My husband watches videos and reads everything he can get his hands on about restoration, as well as researching the internet. You would think there would be nothing left to learn - not true! He really likes this book a lot and is glad he added it to his collection."
1,Book for Adults Posing as Children's Book,The reader from Portland was right--there's something about this book that's not a kid's book. It's weirdly Lolita-ish.
5,What a wonderful recall of Matondo and being a child.,"Sanna's story of Luzolo fills one with the need to wiggle around and chase after all of the animals, yet also the tug to prove to her parents that she really can stay still as she promised. Matondo was alway a difficult time to stay sill in the seat as all the singing, dancing, clapping, and rejoicing went on around, especially with all the animals. Sanna's story telling and illustrations bring back wonderful memories of my childhood Matondos, of which I am now able to share with my own children in a very special way. Thanks Sanna."
2,"Unconvincing, contrived, unfunny","Children's books should be fun to read. This book is too aware of itself. The emphasis should be toward making the child react in an interested manner, but my five-yaer-old said, ""It's boring."" (Sorry, Ms. Stanley.)"
3,Old school fun,While Marble Drop is an older game it still provides hours of fun. A puzzle like game where the user tries to find the correct path to drop the marbles to reach the next level. Only down side is beeing an older game it usally needs to be run in windows compatablity mode when playing the game on Vista or XP.
4,A fun strategy game,"This is a pure strategy game. You are to manuver a set of colored ""marbles"" into a maze of gizmos and devices that are cunning and tricky. The objective is to place each colored marble into its respective color slot. Starts off easy but turns gradually, but increasingly difficult with each succeeding level. This is a good game for : older players and folks that like a strategic challenge. I am 69 y.o. and have enjoyed this game for many years."
5,great photographs,Historical photographs beautifully reproduced and printed of ny's seaport. The text deals more with the historical context of the photographs than with the photos themselves.
1,wrong country,Lovely book. A major problem is that the author is confused about the pysanka and the country she is writing about. The pysanka is a UKRAINIAN Easter egg. Russians do not have pysanky (pl.). Surely by now people should know the difference between Ukraine and Russia (you wouldn't confuse Ireland and England). The pysanka is a most special Ukrainian ritual object. The author should have done her homework.
2,Poor Performance,This glass baster looks great upon first inspection. The only problem is that the bulb does not fit tightly and it will not hold liquid. I did not return it because I have an older baster and used the bulb that was on it with acceptable results.
3,Quite a write.,"This book is very informative, yet somewhat technical for a novice . There are some terminologies in use here that are quite frankly over the top, as far as a layman trying to learn. With some effort however, One can find this book quite beneficial as far as learning how to complete the process of successful screenwriting."
3,Linda Hoyle - 'Peices Of Me' (Angel Air),"Originally released in 1971, as this was the former Affinity vocalist only solo effort. Tracks here that display Hoyle's talent include ""Paper Tulips"". the uplifting title cut ""Pieces Of Me"", her Laura Nyro cover ""Lonely Woman"", ""The Ballad Of Marty Mole"" and ""Journey's End"". Line-up: Linda Hoyle - vocals, Chris Spedding (Nucleus) - guitar, Jeff Clyne - bass, Karl Jenkins - piano, keyboards & oboe and John Marshall - drums. Basically, an okay folk-rock CD import. Could appeal to fans of Julie Driscoll, Tim Buckley and (obviously) the late Laura Nyro."
5,A lot of great memories associated with this album,"Unfortunately, my copy of this cd is locked in a storage unit on the other side of the country, but I remember this being my favorite album by them. So much so that I'm thinking of buying it again!Edit: Bought it and it's as great as I remembered!"
1,"Okay, but not good","Knowing what it is now, I wouldn't have bought this DVD for $25.Go watch some Youtube videos and you'll get as good an understanding as you get from this video. Or for a little more money I also purchased an instructional video from metal shaping zone that I am happy with.This video is dull and lacking in actual weld puddle control content."
1,Beware of Sizing - Runs large,"I ordered the Extra Small, based on the online size chart it should have fit. I was drowning it it. X-small is really a men's small to medium. I'm a 5',2"" 140lb woman."
1,Don't Do it,"I actually bought this item from another site after reading all the other reviews telling me to go to X-Small which is suppose to equal medium (assuming I would get the right one). Wrong: The picture makes the jacket appear fitted and regular size but its really bigger than it appears. Zippers and buttons are gold by the way, not black.I'm 5'9"" (160lbs) and X-small was too bigDON'T DO IT"
3,reinforce.,I like the jacket but .... I didn't have it 6mo and the snaps started ripping out. Also the zipper is hard to zip because the border isn't ridged enough. The sleeves need adjustable Velcro or snaps. All in all the price was good but spend the extra $30 at your local sewing shop to get it reenforced and it will last a long time.
3,my opinion,"Good tweeter response, but a bit disappointing in the bass. Used on original head end system. Just wanted to upgrade speakers from single cone."
3,A mystery writer she's not.,"A disappointing book from a usually excellent writer. However, if you are going to write a murder mystery, then you should consider having motive and opportunity and supposedly highly qualified investigators actually considering this aspect. No one in this book considers either including the author. I also don't think it is necessary to have ignorant main characters just to have action. Still even with a horrible plot and weak characters her book has a good pull."
4,Really Keeps You Going Until The End!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a little bit hard to get into, but definitely worth the wait. I don't know why this book has so many negative comments. I surely didn't guess who the culprit was, and just ended up reading through the night."
3,What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,I have always enjoyed reading Ms Graham's books. But I'll tell you she wasn't even close to her previous romantic suspense thrillers. The characters were weak. The dialoge stunk. This is suppose to be a murder mystery where everyone is a suspect. A lot of twisted personalities in the this story. It was easy to discount the obvious but the actual bad guy was a real stretch. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Rated R For Ridiculous!,"Errr...fluff like this is what gives the romance genre a bad name. Overall, Heather Graham is a wonderful author, but this particular story had me choking on the cloud of stink it emitted. The characters were unrealistic & cheesy...the storyline a puff piece. Granted, we all know that is what makes soap operas famous, but PLEASE! I couldn't even make it halfway through the book without having to place my head between my knees and gasp for air. Yes, it was THAT nauseating. If I want to indulge in cartoon capers, I'll flip on Scooby Doo. I was severely disappointed, and I didn't even spend $ on it. I checked it out from my local library!! = O"
5,Five stars for 32 therapists!,"A wonderful book full of unforgettable psychological trials and triumphs. This book reels you in with the bizarre, takes a glimpse at the various therapy techniques used today, AND makes you really step back, reconsider, and re-evaluate your own perceptions of what is considered strange. If you want to think even further outside the box, READ THIS BOOK!"
4,A Thoughtful Collection of Zany Therapy Sessions,"A collection of first person accounts of the most bizarre therapy encounters ever. This book is interesting because each chapter is written from a different therapists perspective and details how the therapist tackled their bizarre client. The conversations intertwined with the therapists thoughts makes for a very engaging read, if you're studying psychology, or if you just want to read how a psychologist approaches his sessions with a man who is having an affair with a cow, or a family who has dinner with their deceased mother, then this is the book for you! The Mummy at the Dining Room Table is compiled by psychologist/author Jefferey Kottler and is written with great humour without ever making fun. The book loses a star only because some of the stories weren't as comparatively strong or engaging as the others, however, thanks to the book's presentation it is easy to read only the chapters that hold your attention and interest."
5,book review,"a good book, nicely written chapters, very entertaining, liked it; and appreciated by others as a gift."
4,A book that put a smile on my face !,"I hadn't read a Johanna Lindsey since the 1990's. I am so glad I took a chance and read this book. I loved the development of strong characters, the historic English setting and the mystery. Enjoy !"
5,My First Malory!,"Stuck in an airport, and I left my book at home. I was faced with a flight delay and long flight so I poped into the airport book shop to pick up a book from the ""large"" selection there. 5 minutes later I narrowed my choice down to the only thing that looked appealing. 15 minutes later, sitting in front of my gate, I was engrossed. WOW, I lucked out!! I finished this book in about a day. After my business meeting ended the next day, I drove over to the local bookstore in hopes to find another Malory novel and there I picked up Say You Love Me.Both books are fantastic! I am looking forward to reading more and it is safe to say that you can jump in at any point in time and still have a great novel."
3,The Malory clan continues,"I had fallen in love with the Malory clan from the beginning (Love Only Once)and loved each and every book that came out. When Jeremey's story came out, I was so excited. I fell for him when we met him and laughed as he grew in the following stories. I was a little disappointed with his story. This story could have been more for another Malory (one of Eddie's boys) then for Jeremey. However, I am glad that he finally found love. I wish we saw more of his family epescially James and Tony. They were always there for the others it only seem to make since that James would have been around to help his son through his time of love. I do hope that Lindsey continues on with more of the Malory clan. This family is the most loving and the funniest family I have ever met."
5,Definite Re-read Material,Loved it.my second favourite of the malory series (Gentle Rogue) could have given it a 10 but will have to settle for 5 only because I couldnt get it on kindle edition in Ireland so to the Powers That Be please fix this problem as I am dying to add it to my collection.
4,Finally- An author raises the stakes!,"I have read a lot of romance novels and usually I am disappointed because the biggest obstacle is that the hero doesn't want to get married/doesn't believe in love. This book had mystery, intrigue and amnesia. Enjoyable propelling read until the end!"
3,"cute, but not amazing","This book was a cute, light read. I would not get this book for one of the best reads possible, it is also not the best book by JL. But it was worth it for me, so it might just be for you as well."
3,Reasonably Diverting,"I've enjoyed Lindsey's Malory books in the past, but this one really doesn't measure up to some of the earlier books. I found the plot contrivances a little far fetched -- especially the ""dress the maid up as a debutante"" one, and the interplay between the classes simply didn't ring very true for me. Nor did there seem to be much dramatic tension between the characters. Jeremy just seemed too juvenile to be an interesting romantic hero.All in all, not bad for light summer reading -- but don't buy it; get it from the library."
3,What can I Say?,"I love all the Malory's really. Jeremy was my favorite for along time but I felt let down in this one. He was... I don't know, lacking I guess would be a good way to put it.He seemed to stereotypical. Nothing much to him slightly two-dimensional. He didn't seem to be as much as a scroundel as every one said he was, Tony and James were worse than him and well, if it hadn't been for the additional Malory's in the story I don't think I would have liked this book that much.I did like Danny, though. She was fine but it did seem a bit impossibble for her to go form a maid to a debutante with in 48 hrs. Not realistic, in my opinion.It was a decent book and if you have nothing else to do it's a good read. It is satisfying but not worth the twenty I paid for it."
5,CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE THE MALORYS,"THE FIRST JOHANNA LINDSEY NOVEL I READ WAS A PIRATES LOVE BACK WHEN I WAS IN 7TH GRADE. I HAVE TO SAY I WAS NEVER A BIG READER UNTIL THAT BOOK. WELL THANKS TO JOHANNA I AM NOW A VORACIOUS READER! I HAVE READ EVERY ONE OF HER BOOKS AND HAVE TO SAY THE MALORYS ARE MY FAVORITES. I ALSO HAVE TO SAY I READ A LOVING SCOUNDREL IN A DAY, LIKE ALL OF JOHANNA'S OTHER BOOKS I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN! AS ALWAYS YOU CANNOT HELP BUT FALL IN LOVE WITH THE CHARACTERS! JOHANNA HAS A WAY OF WRITING THAT JUST PULLS YOU IN. THE BEST ROMANCE WRITER IN THE BUSINESS! TO MS. LINDSEY THANK YOU!"
3,Lukewarm....,"I love the Malory series & I was so excited when I first learned that Jeremy's story was coming out. However, his story seems lukewarm at best, I wish J.L would have focused more on other members of the Malory clan.But it's still a Malory book, I just hope the next one is more interesting....who will it be next?"
2,Ehhh!,"What in the world was this? Totally not romantic. JL's books are turning into hit or misses now. I wanted to read Jeremy's story so badly too, like a lot of reviewers. But he was awful in this! He was uncaring, shallow, and, well, dumb! I couldn't for the life of me bring myself to like Danny either. She was annoying. Although she certainly didn't deserve the way he took her virginity. JL seems to fail in that in almost every book. The loss of a woman's virginity is an important, emotional, intense scene, not an oh-my-God-you-just-took-my-virginity-why-did-you-do-that-I-didn't-say-you-could-take-my-virtue scene."
4,another tramp who becomes a lady,"There are only a few surprising twists here, but still a good, well-told yarn. Danny is the street-girl shunned by her gang, who ends up working as a maid for the dashing studly Jeremy Malory. She wants him to make a real lady out of her. The fun of the story is in Jeremy trying to get her to sleep with him, and her eluding his advances. She develops real romantic feelings for him, but she doesn't want to give in because she knows he's a [hot] rogue. The prospects of love between them are further complicated by a scheming heiress, and the plot thickens even further as Danny discovers her true identity that she really is a real lady by birth after all anyway! Seems a bit too coincidental? Well sure, perhaps, but such plot devices are common for this kind of novel. As for the ending, it's not surprising but is nevertheless satisfying."
3,Not the best Malory book,"I was a little disappointed in this addition to the Malory series. Jeremy didn't seem quite as charming as he has in the past and it totally lacked the updates on the other family members that I have come to look forward to. Beyond that, it was a fairly decent story though not as good as some of the other Malory books."
4,Excellent read - for a Lindsey book,"I almost didn't pick this book up, considering how awful her last few books have been. But I am glad I read this. It was a page turner. The characters weren't totally predictable. I was impressed. Johanna must finally be reading the reviews of her last few books and improved her writing. There weren't paragraphs of conversation like her last few books. She actually describes characters and scenes in this book so you feel more a part of it. Good read overall."
3,"Great book, but not a Malory novel.","My feelings on this book are so mixed. On the one hand, I think it's a really interesting story, if predictable. I think Danny is a very interesting character and got very fond of her by the end. But...I've been looking forward to this book since I *started* the Malory novels -- Jeremy's book! At last we'd learn a bit more about his incredibly unusual and interesting upbringing and get a look at the man behind the charming scamp. Welll...this wasn't that book. Jeremy was there, all right, but his character wasn't developed at *all*. If I hadn't read the rest of the Malory novels, I would've have even been interested in him. Except for one mention that he grew up in a tavern (and it even got the ages wrong!), nothing in Jeremy's past comes into play at ALL. After so long of looking forward to Jeremy's story, this just left me incredibly disappointed, despite it being a good book."
3,Very disappointed fan-AGAIN,"Well, this book was certainly better than ""A Man To Call MY Own"". There still not the magic you feel of Johannah Lindsey's characters getting to know each other and falling in love. The characters were more apart then together in this story. The character development in this book sucked. One minute Jeremy is enjoying his affair with Danny and then suddenly you turn the page and he is in love with her. What's up Johannah Lindsey??? You haven't produce a story of your potential in a long time."
4,"It's not the best Malory novel, BUT still worth reading","This by far is not the best Malory novel, but I still could not put it down. I enjoy Lindsey's characters that she has created and enjoy reading their continuing stories. Jeremy is a rake, but not quite up to Malory ""rakeness"". Danny, however does live up to be the smart, witty heroines that many Lindey readers love."
4,A Loving Scoundrel,"As with all of the other Malory books, this was a great story. It did not have as much suspense as I would have thought, but the way they have the men fall for their women regardless of social status is great. It also shows how he has grown into a fantastic man throughout all of her novels before hand. I must admit that ""Say you love me"" is one of my favorites. Now all we need is to some more books on the Andersons. Drew would be the perfect one to right about. Hope to see it soon."
5,Hard to find but worth the effort,"A classic just like ""The Beastmaster"" a great flick to watch when home sick with the Flu. Wonderful B movie from its time."
3,My childhood memory is different,I watched this movie a thousand times as a kid when it was on HBO. I have only watch it once since getting the DVD. For the era it was made in I think it is still one of the best.
3,HAWK THE SLAYER Review,"I sought this movie out from seeing it many years back. The film is somewhat low-budget, the plot is simple, but the characters in the film really hold your interest. Jack Palance has some unforgetable one-liners.Some friends and I have fun quoting his lines.In some ways it is similar to ""KRULL"" and ""EXCALIBER"", but not as scenic. It was neat to watch it again and I am happy to have this movie in my collection."
4,80's fantasy with cheese!,"DescriptionTwo brothers vie for the possession of a magical sword. Hawk (John Terry) is the younger brother, known for his duty, honour and courage. Voltan (Jack Palance) is the older brother who is known for his villainous ways. The lethal weapon bestows upon its owner incredible powers of destruction and Hawk, along with his comrades, the Elf and the Dwarf, must combat the forces of evil. *I still love this film even though it is dated badly.a ""B"" flick at its best and high speed arrow shooting still looks cool *see LOTR* Sadly only a Trailer as a dvd extra"
4,Painfully delightful,"I saw this movie as a kid and loved it. I watched it again a few weeks ago and couldn't believe how much I missed the first time. It's amazing how many drinking games could work with this movie. In an era where so many so-called movies are variations on a theme, this movie is original in so many ways -- bad acting and all. Give it a try before you knock it."
3,7th Grade Revisited in Medevil Action,"I was eleven going on twelve in the 7th grade when I caught this movie on Showtime. My sister, who was eight, fell immediately in love with Hawk played by John Terry. No man had ever looked so good in leather. Because of our crush, we fell hook, line, and sinker for the cliched drama and action and comedy relief. But now as a mature 34 year old, I still find Hawk very handsome but I also enjoy the action, music, and goofiness this movie offers. It's just good clean enterntainment about the age old good vs evil plot. If you like sorcery, medevil movies, cheesy special effects, and chorographed fight scenes with swords--this movie is for you!"
3,Elfs and more Elfs? Oh Yes!,"Ok first of all this film is old and the acting is quite wooden at times but it has a great bunch of charaters that wouldn't be out of place in the Lord of the Rings. It also has the best Elf character in any movie of its kind. Retro, cool and very similar to the old Clint Eastwood Cowboy movies of yesterday. The sound track is also retro. If wizards and warriors is your thing then this movie is well worth a look. If this movie had been made for today using blue screen special effects it would well deserve a 5 star rating."
4,moon atlas,"clear photos and clear labeling; high quality paper; large size pages allow decent size photos.photos are reversed right-left , they are inverted horizontally, i.e. they are not what is seen with the naked eye.this book is significantly better than legault-brunier's new atlas of the moon.the best moon atlas for me is by antonin rukl. the drawings are oriented the same as the naked eye view. however; rukl's book is expensive."
3,Good but just not great.,"I think it's not great because it has few excellent songs but others were unfamiliar to me. However, the good ones are good just not enough of them. I think the title needs to change to ""5 number ones and a few others""."
2,Buyer Beware!,"I am disappointed with this walkman. When playing cassettes, it makes a loud whirring noise that can be heard over the music. This has been a problem since the day I got it. Additionally, after I accidentally dropped it once from a height of about three feet onto a soft carpet, the sound plays only through one ear. I realize I shouldn't have dropped it, but clearly this walkman is not a very sturdy or durable product. I expect better from SONY."
4,Great Re-Issue!,Great re-issue of the duo's second release. Lots of charm and plenty of nice tracks on this CD. Starbrite is a standout! Thanks to the people who re-released this on CD. Now we just need Sanford Townsend's third LP re-released on CD and all will be perfect!!
3,Sanford & Townsend--2nd time around.,"This is the 2nd recording by Sanford & Townsend. After the brilliance of the first one, I expected the same here, but they just never seem to catch fire this time. It just kind of lays there. Could it be that a change in producers was the reason? Whatever, something is different. This certainly ranks as a disappointment."
4,Great find,"I had this album on vinyl years ago, but have no way to convert to CD. I saw these guys live at Clemson Univ. in 1974. Brought back many memories."
3,Poor Kris wasted talent. Low Budget,"The Tracker. starring Khris Khristofferson HBO ProductionsStory of a Tracker that comes out of retirement as a favor to an old friend to track down a band of ruthless killers. Kristofferson's character's is, ""The Tracker"". His son, a visiting newly graduated attorney visiting from back east joins the manhunt but has allot to learn about his father and the men their chasing.Fair story, less than good acting. Attention to detail by director and film editor was terrible. ( HBO's budget must have been minuscule for this one.) Several scenes have Contrails in them; Also, tire tracks during horse chase scenes are readily visible in several scenes.The acting by the BAD GUYS and the BOUNTY HUNTERS help carry an otherwise 2 star movie.The ending is more in the tradition of ""Old School"" westerns which is a GOOD thing ! However getting there was not the ride it could have been.The Tracker"
3,Average Western,This is a very average Western Movie in all aspectsStory: 3/5 Scenery: 3/5 Costumes: 3/5 Acting: 3/5Recommended only if you Like Kristofferson
4,Modern Day Western,"Wonderful modern day western with a intense look at father, son relationship. Certainly worth the purchase and worth seeing again and again....."
3,Formulaic HBO entry,"Plot, drama, suspense, character development -- this western has them all, to reasonable measure. It seems awfully like other HBO movies I have seen. If you like westerns, this may be a candidate for an evening's entertainment. If you like exceptional westerns, try ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", ""A Big Hand for the Little Lady"", ""El Mariachi"", ""Stagecoach"" or the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns."
2,No Academy Awards Here,"A pretty lame western from all aspects. Weak story line, poor character development and the acting (if one can call it that)was almost non-existant. The movie was filmed in beautiful locations however, the director was not even interested enough in the project to shoot in locations void of jet trails in the sky.If you like westerns like I do, I would not watch this one more than once. I was very relieved when it ended, so relieved I skipped the credits at the end."
5,Good movie,This was ahusband choice and I really enjoyed it as well. Good actors and there are so few westerns made now so it is hard to find one that is not so old and not so sappy.
2,The Tracker,"It is a good movie,I saw it years ago and wanted to see it again.I received the movie in good time and in good condition.The price was very reasonable."
5,the tracker,"great movie, full of excitement. full speed movie did not bog down. always loved chris kristroferson movies. will look for other movies."
4,A Solid Western!,"I'm really amazed when I look at some of the critiques that people come up with related to this and/or other movies, and how badly some of these critics need criticizing themselves. This might not have been the ultimate western, but it was a well made movie with a solid plot, casting, scenery, and acting. For those of you clueless dimwitts who thought it was ""hokey?"", well, you might as well stick to watching and critiquing how well a dog salivates."
1,Zipper broke in just one morning!,"I wish we had read these reviews before I purchased the same bag from an eBay vendor. The zipper to the main compartment came off the track during the first morning the bag was used by our kindergartener son. He was so upset that one of the adults tried to fix it, but the zipper pull (and the loop on the zipper slider that holds the zipper pull) broke off, making matters worse. We are trying to find someone who can replace the slider. I would not recommend this bag to anyone."
1,"not so ""super"" backpack",my son was heart broken when the zipper broke 2 days after we bought it. After 2 days of taking it to school the other zipper broke and the logo started to peel. the zippers are very cheap thin plastic and the overall quality is horrible.
2,Thanks for getting my son's hopes up!,"My kindergartner was so excited when we saw this backpack online and we couldn't wait for it's arrival. Visually, it's stunning - I was contemplating using it myself if he decided not to keep it! However, on DAY 1 when I picked him up from school, BOTH of the zippers had broken (the clasp thingy had fallen off) rendering it useless and now I have to return it. My son was really upset, as was I...and I also wish I had the reviews on here before I bought it since apparently this has happened more than once before! Beware this backpack, fellow superman fans - it brings heartbreak!"
4,Secret of the Golden Pavilion,"I like this book like every other Nancy Drews. IF you read this book you love it too. I have almost read all the Nancy Drew books. I have known Nancy when I was in 4th grade, but I never really bothered for it. I Started Nancy Drew at the age of 11 and and I really love and at the age of 12 I am reading them all from Book# 1 to Book# 59"
2,Well researched but dry,"The book clearly required extensive research, and is a reference book for certain. The whole time I was forced to read it, though, I was trying to figure out the purpose of compiling all the information contained in its covers. Its a survey of Christian missions from the beginning of recorded history until its publication, and is simply a chronological compilation. You won't come away from it remembering any of the innumerable and seemingly inconsequential names, dates and details, but you'll come away knowing that it was an extensively researched reference book that is useful for writing papers and further research but isn't something you'll ever want to read again if you can help it."
4,The History,This book is very interesting. It is written as scholarly work and takes a lot of attention to understand. But it is a great book for anyone who wants to know the history of Christian Missions from the very beginning.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this 2 weeks ago. Used it about half a dozen times and the motor's busted. It's smelled since the first use. Other reviewers reported the same. I'm buying one of these insteadKitchenAid KTA-KPCB348PPM Pro Line Chef's Blender with Polycarbonate Jar, Pearl Metallic"
3,works well but a bit noisy,"We burnt through a couple of cheaper blenders before getting this, and so far it has held up well. It's simple to use, looks good, and fairly easy to clean.But it's quite noisy, not just from the blades or motor, but a sharp rattling sound from the jug/blade assembly."
5,great blender,"I read quite a few reviews on this blender and was so glad I made the decision to purchase. I'd pay full price for it. I love to cook and own a couple appliances but not many. I have an old blender (made of plastic and who knows what else), that served its purpose in college, however that was ten years ago. I almost decided to get a combo blender/food processor, however I always said I'd stick with Cuisinart for the food processor. I did debate between the similar classic Oster for this blender as well. I don't know how that one competes, but the good reviews on this blender sold me - I wanted simple, high quality. I think I got it."
2,A little disappointed,"""Warring"" has a high reputation for being a powerful blender. I purchased because of its reputation. But it turned out to be actually not that powerful and may not be as powerful as the one I had before which only costed $30. So I asked myself why bothered to replace it when the new one, ""Warring"", in fact does not really break ice any better than the cheap ones."
3,Worked Great until Today,"I mostly use my blender to make smoothies with frozen strawberries in them. The blender worked beautifully... until today. All the reviews led me to believe that the blender is durable... I guess not. I bought the blender last year and it started working the same. I shut it down and attempted to turn it back on... dead. I'm not sure what happened, no smoke so I guess it's not the motor. Don't get me wrong, the blender works great but it died way earlier than expected (and I use it on average every 2 weeks). I guess I'll try ot get it fixed."
1,Lasted less than a month,I bought this to make fruit shakes for my family. It worked fine the first few times with just fruit but then when I added ice it stopped working. The blade stuck and I think it burned out the motor. The blender does not have the power to crush ice. What use is that?
2,It seemed sturdy...,"I totally splurged on this blender because I'd had a vintage Waring in the past that was really powerful but I could no longer use it because the seal was irreplacable. I thought this one would last a long time but the engine blew out after less than a year. I'd used it maybe every other day or every few days to make smoothies. About a month ago it started running more slowly and sometimes there would be a aburning smell. Then yesterday it died. When it did run it was just ok--I always had to do a lot of stirring to get things to mix properly. I liked the 2 speeds on it but next time I'm going for a cheaper, more powerful one like Oster or Kitchen Aid."
2,Great Blender - Lousy Glass Jar,"This is a great blender. However, I've had to replace the jar twice in two years. Both times there were problems with the assembly that spins the blades. On one jar it began leaking. On the other jar it flew apart while blending a smoothie.I use the unit almost every day, but a ""Pro"" bartop jar should last longer than a year. And they're very expensive to replace. You can buy a new cheap blender for the price of replacing the jar on this one."
2,I wouldn't recommend,The blender jar leaks and the motor is breaking down after less than a year. Don't over use it and rarely crush ice. I think it's overpriced.
3,Not perfect but best among the alternatives,We had this blender for about two years before the motor burned out. I think large ice cubes placed in the blender first (over time) was the reason for this. Maybe better to add them once the blades get going.We're going to get another one because I think it's one of the better blenders made. (Consumer Reports agrees). It's otherwise very sturdy and has a 'professional' feel to it unlike some others which have a 'plastic' feel and appearance.
1,Beware of Waring!!!,"My wife and I received a Waring Blender (60th Anniversary edition) from our wedding registry at Williams Sonoma. During the second time we ever used it, the blade shaft snapped in two while trying to crush ice. We immediately returned it to Williams Sonoma, and the store manager told us that they get 4-5 Waring blenders returned every week!! This obviously is not the same company anymore, so please pay attention to the other negative reviews, which seem to be indicative of our experience.P.S. - We traded ours in for a Kitchen Aid, which works 100 times better than the Waring."
5,The only blender I will ever use,"I will never use any other blender for anything. As a chef, I take it with me to all my cooking classes and it never fails to get the job done perfectly. Worth every penny."
1,Horrible for smoothies,"I'm on my third blender (store of purchase replaces it) and the latest one AGAIN smells and seems to be working at less than full capacity. I make smoothies - for me and my kids everyday. I've gotten so I throw in fresh fruit & veggies first, then frozen fruit and then ice and other ingredients (dry milk, etc...). And once again I'm having problems with the Waring blender. It's supposed to be such a great blender - and I have the anniversary edition - but it does not work well at all. I'm switching to a KitchenAid!"
2,Not an all-round machine,"We own a vintage version (early 60's and still running) of this machine, so thought we'd give the update a try. We returned it due to its inability to crush ice. Disappointing, but that's a must for a drink machine. Powerful motor is one thing, but some variety of speeds is another, and this machine is either high-low-or-off."
5,The Best Blender,"I have tried several blenders over several years' time, but this model is by far the best one I have ever used or owned. It has no bottom screw-on parts to come loose while you are blending, and it is very simple to use - just two speeds on one switch, but that's all it needs to whip up drinks or crush ice faster and better than any of its competitors."
2,Not Pleased with Glass Jar,"I bought this blender one year ago. We make smoothies several times a week. We were tired of burning out the motors in the Walmart blenders. After 2 months of use the blade at the bottom of the far came apart. The ""wagon wheel"" part of the assembly that contacts to the base completely fell off. We ordered a brand new Jar. After several months it appears that the seal on the blade assembly started to leak and the bearinings seized up from the moisture getting under the seal. The last time I used the blender, the motor was spinninmg the entire blade assembly at the incredible rpm that it works at and within a few seconds the entire contents of the glass jar along with little pieces of glass were all over the countertop and floor. The metal of the assembly grated out the bottom of the jar. I have to say that the motor has performed admirably but the jars have not stood up to the job."
1,PRO---I don't think so,"If this machine is what the Professionals use, they ought to consider using a lesser machine...My old blender, a KitchenAid, lasted years and performed much better than this Waring. When blending smoothies, this machine creates air pockets and the user must continually ""jiggle"" the machine in order to facilitate the actual blending. Also, when chopping ice cubes, the motor smells like it is working overtime. The machine looks cool, but that is where the quality ends. I shipped it back to Amazon for a refund."
1,Poor quality blender...worked 8 months then stopped,"Good looking, sufficiently powerful blender for daily smoothies, but it stopped working after 8 months. It just quit and would not turn on. Beware: the warranty does NOT offer a replacement; you must send it in for repair. What a hassle that could have been avoided if they had simply built a reliable product in the first place. Waring customer service had no one available to take my call and asked me to leave a message. No one called me back; I finally had to call their Sales Dept to talk to someone (it's funny how they always have someone to answer phones in the Sales Dept but Service is always out ""helping other callers"").I also noticed the glass chipping that was mentioned in an earlier review. I thought maybe I had chipped it accidentally, although I couldn't remember doing so. If this problem is endemic to this model, it certainly makes sense.If you want a reliable blender, I advise you to look elsewhere."
2,Not the power expected,"I purchased this blender expecting outstanding power from a simple design. It is simple, for example the container is a sealed unit; you cannot separate the blade unit from the glass. I prefer this design since it prevents leaks, there's no gasket to baby, and it cleans easily. However, I was disappointed with the lack of power. Smoothies and blended drinks require more time and effort than expected. If I had it to do over, I'd purchase a different unit."
2,Waring Pro - under powered,"I bought this six years ago mainly because my father used Waring blenders at the restaurant he owned for 36 years. I was disappointed in its lack of power. It does cut up ice cubes well enough but was not powerful enough for ice cream drinks so you have to baby it a little bit or you will notice the motor starting to smell. I add extra liquid and or ice to help the blender along when doing ice cream drinks though this does make for a soupier drink. I also bought one of these for my son and he burned the motor out within a year. If you are going to use it for ice based drinks like Margarita's it is okay but otherwise find a blender that cranks out at least 750 watts as opposed to the 390 watts this one does. A misnomer to call this a ""Pro""."
1,Not the same old blender,"I read the reviews, should have listened.We had an older model with less watts that made us smoothies every morning for over 5 years. The motor burned out on day, figured it had performed well for the price paid. Wanting to stick with the same brand and type we bought this model. When it came I saw the base was larger and that it had a higher watt motor. Initially I thought this was a good thing. Nope. Didn't even last 6 months and its dead. Just another example of what our manufacturing industry is doing to cut costs. Please someone start making appliances and tools like they used too."
2,Worn-out Waring Blender,"I purchased the Waring Pro Blender for my daily protein smoothie. However, the blender broke down after only 8 months (bearins squeeling and motor smells). From what I have read, the frozen fruit that I added almost daily should have been softened. However, Waring's promotion of this product does not mention that the blender will not stand-up to this. In fact, you would reach quite the opposite conclusion from their advertising.It works fine otherwise...but is now junk after 8 months use."
1,Broke after 1 month of light use - not good for fruit smoothies.,"My wife purchased this blender specifically for blending fruit shakes and smoothies. It worked quite well for that purpose until... it broke after 1 month of light use - the threaded shaft which the blade is attached to just snapped clean off. The metal on the inside of the snapped shaft looks like a cheap, weak, alloy. It's sad that Waring has decided to cut corners in this way. They don't make them like they used to. Not recommended."
1,Huge Disappointment - it leaks!,"I bought this blender after careful reserach; it was recommended by Consumer Reports and others. From the beginning liquid escaped around the lid and I learned to live with that. Soon, it began leaking from the base of the jar and nothing I did alleviated the leaking. I tried everything. I finally threw it away, went to a discount store and bought one for $20. It's working great. Don't waste your money on this appliance."
1,Waring Pro Blender with new blade design,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S8F8/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleLooks nice but who cares about looks when blender fails to blend. Specific claims refer to Waring Pro completely handles frozen fruit and ice, but the blade and shaft design causes the blade to loosen on the shaft. So far maintenance requires the retaining nut to be tightened to keep the shaft from turning while the blade does not. Found out after the purchase that it's common for the shafts to snap (replacement cost $25.00.) Also the motor is very loud on high speed, and not so quiet on the low speed.Blender, waring pro"
1,A big disappointment!,"I read the other reviews, and thought I had finally found a blender that would crush ice, make daiquiris, and blend soups, and this blender did none of those things! Even after adding 2 cups of water to the ice, the blade just spun around and never mixed the cubes into the blend. Only the bottom inch or so ever got blended. The same thing even happened with some cooked tomatoes in juice. Only the very bottom food got blended; then I had to stop and stir up the contents. After several stops, I decided this was just not a good product."
1,BIG DISSAPOINTMENT,"With all the other 5 star ratings, I thought well, ok, if itdoes work great than I don't mind spending (the money) But, this machine works like something you would buy for (much less).I was hoping to make frozen drinks quickly, and without the machine sounding like it's working too hard . Amazon advertises it to be a Professional Bar Blender and to have 390 watts of power, that sounds great! But, I would never use this machine for Professional use when it barely blends for home use.I am majorly dissapointed!"
5,Great Shade of Quality Copper-Commerical Blender!,"Very please not only with the performance of this little ice buster for great summer frozen drinks, but at the quality of the ways it is manufactured, the heavyweight copper and the brilliance of the copper. Some of the copper is an ugly faded shade of copper but this is a brilliant shade of quigh quality copper and you can tell it will last for years and be easy to clean. I am so glad that I went with this Waring Commercial Bar Blender than going with any of the other Kitchen-Aid, CuisinArt, etc... brands. I maade the right choice this time."
3,Undecided,I purchased this item because this firm has replacement parts in the event a component should break as it inevitably does with Oster and especially GE. I have used it a few times and it seems to strain and lack power when the container is quite full although it seems to get the job done. There is a smell however that is similar to heated plastic so I am not sure I will keep it. I have been trying to find Braun appliances which were absolutely unkillable and simply the BEST but they are no longer available in North America. Shame!!
1,What a waste of money,"We used this blender probably a total of 5 times before the metal base FUSED to the motor!!!! It literally became FUSED!! Now, we thought all we had to do was order the base part from the Waring company. No, they don't sell that part. I was told by the Waring customer service people that I would have to take the blender to be serviced. Ha! Like I'm going to spend $45 to repair a BLENDER! We are buying a new one....needless to say it won't be a Waring blender."
3,Stand back and be prepared to clean up a mess,"I received this blender as a gift and was delighted to finally have a good, solid blender that can crush ice when making drinks. And this blender does that well. However, when I tried a new recipe that required a blender to mix liquids without ice I wound up with a big mess to clean up. What I didn't realize is that the clear plastic dome that screws into the black rubber lid doesn't create a leak-proof seal. After you line up the dome with the lid and turn twist it into place a gap remains where the liquid can escape. When I turned on the blender the liquid shot up through the gaps and landed all over me and the surrounding walls. I called the company for a new lid thinking the one I had was defective. The new one had the identical defect. This blender is good for semi-solids and mixing liquids with ice, but definitely not for blending/mixing liquids."
2,"Attractive, but not very functional","This blender is attractive, but just doesn't work very well. It only has two speeds, high and very high. It seemed to have difficulty even on simple tasks like smoothies, perhaps because an air bubble often appears down by the blades due to the high speed. It is also extremely noisy, even for a blender.I ended up buying a much cheaper blender (a Braun) instead and put this one away on a top shelf to use only for parties."
2,They don't make em like they used to,"I purchased this blender on the basis of my Waring blender that I purchased in 1968 and is still going strong. I broke the jar and decided it was time for another one. So I bought this one, professional quality not withstanding. When I tried to make my daily smoothie (milk, Yogurt, and frozen fruit), this blender needed some stirring assistance to get things blended up. I don't call that professional quality. If it won't make a smoothie, I figure there are a lot of other things it won't do. So I returned it. I think the way this blender is advertised is misleading."
2,Product broke in 1 month,"We received this product just over a month ago, and it has already broken. The white gasket around the blade came apart. I use the product to make smoothies, usually one per day."
3,Simplicity Works,"I like this kitchen appliance a lot. Fast, Faster, Stop...those are the speeds. That's all I need. The cloverleaf design churns nicely, too. Just wish it weren't so expensive."
2,"Looks Good, Works So-So","High marks for the retro look, but doesn't function well. It is very loud, prone to leaking, can't make a smooth smoothie, can't replace blade or rubber gasket."
3,Feels like the jar could topple out any minute.,"It's very pretty and does a great job, but the jar lifts right out of the holder. I'm afraid it'll fall right out, and so I end up standing there holding onto it whenever I use it. Waring gets a C- for design!"
1,Product broke in 3 weeks!,"Bought what we thought was the best. After three weeks of being used once in the morning, the seal on the jar started leaking badly. We've taken it to a Waring authorized center but this product obviously isn't like it was in the past. Looks the same, but must be a cheap version at a higher price. I can't recommend this to anyone."
1,Glass container leaks after 5 months,5 Months Later - the glass container leaks all over the top of the unit and the counter top. Contacted Amazon and was told after 30 days you are on your own. Contacted Waring and getting the run around. I need to box up the entire unit and return for them to inspect. Was told that the unit is not designed to make one smoothie a day with soy milk and a handful of frozen strawberries. Really? I should thaw the strawberries first. $100 and lasted less than 6 months.
1,Save Your Money,"Had less than one month, made nothing but smoothies, engine burned out. When this thing croaks when you follow the instructions on the back of a can of frozen Baccardi mixers, you know you've got an inferior product -- and one you paid too much for.Give me a break. What a useless appliance."
1,SMOKIN HOT!!,What a piece of junk. I used it 3 times and it smoked and stunk up my whole house all 3 times! I thought I was doing something wrong until I started researching this product more. This is a common thing with this product. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!
1,Pro? Doesn't that stand for professional?,"When our old blender died after many years, we bought the Waring Pro. Pro? Really? After a few months the shaft holding the blade sheared off. You could see it was made of cheap alloy. (Other reviewers have reported the same experience.) We returned it and got a replacement. It worked alright for more than a year, but now after a few seconds of blending frozen fruit for smoothies, it smells like something is burning, and it makes ominous noises. The warranty has expired, so we'll use it until it dies and then buy something else. It's pretty to look at, but that's about it."
1,Fell Apart,"Bought this because the idea of the ""blending parts"" are sealed (can't remove) seemed like it would be sturdier... NOT the case!! Broke off inside the blender a little over a year later (of course, now out of warrenty!) I would LOVE to find a blender that doesn't eat itself and/or die on me, but haven't found it yet!!"
2,broke after 2 years,"I bought this blender two years ago because it was so well-rated. From the start it was never a great blender. Even when making smoothies, I have to stop it and use a large spoon to move around the ingredients. After about two years of use (and it wasn't used too often, maybe once a month for soup, milkshakes, or smoothies) the engine just stopped. Very disaapointing."
1,A Very Poor Product,"Read the negative comments about this blender carefully, because they are all true, to some degree. This blender mixes thick liquids and soft foods readily and quite quickly, but fails miserably at blending almost anything frozen. And the motor does smell as if it is about to burn out when it has the least trouble blending ingredients, which occurs frequently. I have the Oster 4096 blender also, and at almost 40% less in price, the Oster outshines this Waring by a mile. Waring should be ashamed of this product, and the engineers who designed it should be ashamed as well, and I will not purchase another Waring product, for fear they are still working for the company. Use of the word ""Professional"" in the product description is laughable; this blender wouldn't last a day in a professional setting."
1,"piece of junk, bad customer service","I had this blender for about 2 weeks, when it decided to jam up and my last smoothie had a torn rubber washer and broken glass in it. When I called Waring they told me that it is not meant for frozen fruit (! - what else would you put in a blender?!), and did not offer to replace or repair it. Spend your money elsewhere..."
1,Returned,"Did not read the book. It was returned because of some defects on the cover. Actually purchased as gift, but couldn't give it as it wasn't perfect."
2,A personal/detailed bit of history,This book is an excellent reach into personal experiences of a family that saw tragedy face-to-face. Great details and descriptions. Rather slow but worth your time. I read every word.
1,God's Word?,"As a student of Hebrew and Greek, I find ""God's Word"" to miss the mark when it comes to the work of Bible translation--so much so, that, at times, it has a greater claim to being a paraphrase than does the ""Living Bible."" There are much better translations available which more closely approximate the import of the original languages. The language of ""God's Word"" exhibits the melodrama of a form of highly emotional, individualistic pietism lying outside of any community of historic Christianity. If you wish to think you understand the Bible, but in actuality end up understanding it less, read ""God's Word."" If you want to understand the Bible, as difficult as it may be at times, devote yourself to reading a much better translation, such as the New King James' Version and plug your mind into an actual community of historic Christianity which spans the centuries and is not simply a product of the times."
2,Don't take their word for it.,"Those who believe that the (real) Bible is God's word should avoid this and similar ""loose"" translations (e.g. the Living Bible) like the plague. The sponsors of this translation are apparently afraid to let you read an exact translation; instead they give you their own interpretation ""that tells you what it means."" If you believe that the Bible is God's word, and you can't read Greek and Hebrew, then you should read a version produced by experts in Greek and Hebrew who have tried to translate the original texts as precisely as possible. This here is a theological interpretation, a paraphrase, claiming to be something it is not.If God made the Bible confusing, then surely He had a reason. These people want to ""simplify"" it to make sure that you agree with them."
4,very good buy,"The non-stick ability of Circulon Total is just amazing... when you wash this wok you would barely have to scrub it. At first I was thrown off by the humongous un-aesthetically pleasing lid, but I bought it anyway at Linens 'n Things (for $60) cuz it was a much cheaper option than Calphalon or Emerilware woks. To my surprise, this wok works great and was definitely worth the money. The huge lid is great for steaming, and if you have the storage space for it, go ahead this item wouldn't disappoint you"
4,almost totally different cd from the original,"I just wanted to point out that this Silver Anniversary CD has almost entirely different music from the original - compare the track listings. If you have one and are a fan of the series, you should definitely get the other."
3,Ok - not the best,"The cream is ok, it's a good moisturizer, but a bit greasy for me. It takes a little while until it soaks into my skin. After using Origins Youthtopia for many years, I do see a difference in quality. It's a less expensive alternative, but I don't think I'll be buying another jar after the current one is gone."
5,Finally met my favoriate moisturizer!,"A friend of time recommended this for my dry skin. Tried and True! Love every single - scent, feel, effect- of it. Plus, it's organic!"
2,"Crève, charogne !","...On a beau chercher : une grosse douzaine de titres pour ce qui aurait d tre un cauchemar, c'est tout ce qu'il y a à sauver de ce double album.Le spectre gueule : ""Hallyday ! Qu'as-tu fait de ton talent ?""Hamlet est bien mal (des)-servi, mes seigneurs. 'Faut dire qu'on ne confie pas la confection du Livret à un Groscolas, chanteur-à-minettes, s'il en fut.Le spectre du Vieux Roi assassiné hantera longtemps encore le Royaume de Danemark. Pourvu que la pourriture finisse par ronger le corps de ce chanteur défoncé à la coke ! Fasse qu'Ophélie lui injecte la Folie Destructrice et la Furie en vermine dans les jambes, répondant ainsi à l'injonction du Spectre qui lui ordonne, avec le choeur des ectoplasmes : ""Tue-le ! Tue-le ! Tue-le !"". Alors resplendira la Lumière d'Hamlet et de Sir William sur Copenhague et le monde !"
2,More the Rest than the Best,"The title is misleading. The CD contains stuff from the album Ace Of Spades and rare tracks. This combination makes no sense. No collector needs an album with rare staff and songs of the classic Ace of Spades. For Someone who wants to buy only one Motorhead CD should buy No Sleep 'Till Hammersmith, Ace Of Spades, Bomber, Overkill or a real best of collection."
1,Have not gotton,"Still have not gotten and do not want it at this point.Was ordered well over six weeks ago,and AMAZON has been no help."
2,"simple-minded, lacks information","This book has some good principles, but it is repetitive, and after a while it becomes silly. Whenever you get to a point where you want some hard information, she gives you the names of a few books where you can find it, which is the one redeeming quality of this book. I cannot believe it took her more than a couple of weeks (or less) to write this. It is mostly white space, even when there are words."
1,Still waiting for the funny part,"I have recently purchased this book through Amazon based on a recommendation from Amazon who claimed that this book was so hilarious one would find themselves with tears in their eyes and belly aches from laughing so hard. Well here I am, over half way through book and I have yet to find myself smirking, much less laughing at Frazier's little snipets of life. This is one of those books where you can't help but ask yourself why someone would take the time to write this stuff down and why was I dumb enough to buy it. I guess it's true what they say, every day a sucker is born."
1,Don't bother,"The reviews I read for this book described it as funny and quirky. It was neither. The book is very short and is made up of essays that average 3 pages long--it doesn't have much meat to it. And I found the essays dense, hard to get through, and most of all, not funny. If you want to read a book of humorous essays, read David Sedaris. If you've already read David Sedaris, read him again. This book is a good one to miss."
4,Don't let the title scare you,"As it turns out, this book has absolutely nothing to do with ways to date your mother. Caveat emptor, I guess. Sadly, there aren't many such books available anymore. The days of the short story/essay style humorist appear to be fading in the glare of TV humor (from Letterman to Leno to C-SPAN), making books like Ian Frazier's ""Dating Your Mom,"" Christopher Buckley's ""Wry Martinis,"" and Doug Hecox's ""Star Spangled Banter"" or ""Graze Expectations"" all the more valuable.For more recommendations on contemporary humorous literature, visit www.dougfun.com!"
1,Essays from the bottom of the file cabinet - put 'em back!,"Remember the guiy in high-school that never seemed to ever wash his hair, talk to anyone, or attend any school events, and was always smoking who-knows-what? If it was a comedy high-school, this is what he would have written (and it was edited by the guy that always sat in the courtyard playing chess by himself). Of the 15 essays I read (and I had trouble forcing myself to get past the first paragraph on any of them), only one was remotely funny. And, his title essay, ""Dating your Mom"", is too incestuous to be even remotely funny."
4,"3"" bit",Does what it says it will do. Hit one nail with it and it's toast and will need to be resharpened.
3,Not good for pressure treated wood,I bought this to bore through a landscape timber in order to insert a drainage pipe. It was obviously the wrong tool for the job.
1,poor quality control,"I purchased a Line Pod a while back. The first thing I noticed was the sound of a loose screw rattling around inside. Later, after only about 30 hours of use, the effects started fading in and out. It's now to the point where the effects are not produced and I've given up using the Pod and I just now feed my guitar directly into my amp. Needless to say I've been very disapointed with this purchase."
5,break free and fly!,"Thanks, Lynn, for the heartfelt thoughts on this confusing malady! We do indeed take our baggage from childhood with us, whether we're conscious of it or not. When you're ready to break free, this book is so very helpful with just the right mix of encouraging humor, empathy and clarity."
4,Worth the read,Good insight for people whom have a relationship with someone with BPD & why we keep going back for more.
1,Save your money,"I work w/ families who often have serious mental health & addiction problems. I read ""Breaking Free From Boomerang Love"" to gain more insight into Borderline Personality Disorder. I didn't. The author wrote about her personal experience, and not from a professional viewpoint. It sounded like what one would share at a 12 step program. I felt she lacked the clinical expertise to offer advice to others who may be dealing with this disorder. Also, 1/3 of the book was cartoons the author felt worthy enough to include. For the most part, they weren't. A LOT LESS would have been much better."
3,A decent solid book,"I read Boomerang Love after having it come up in discussion during a support group. Some members said they found it really useful and I decided to give it a try. The book was interesting but seemed to be more of a journal than a book that offered actual advice. But still it was a decent read. Although it has a lot of pages, about half are inspirational cartoons.Michelle"
4,Good Buy,I bought this for my 11 yeard old niece. She enjoyed it and the patterns seemed relatively easy for her.
4,"These drops taste great, and really helped my ...","These drops taste great, and really helped my allergy-induced sore throat. I'd buy them from drugstore.com again."
4,"These drops worked well and tasted good, too. ...","These drops worked well and tasted good, too. I'd recommend them."
3,"While these drops provided the essential vitamin supplements, ...","While these drops provided the essential vitamin supplements, the cherry flavor took a while to get used to. At first, it almost tasted like a bad cherry cough drop, and I was expecting a flavor more like candy. After getting used to the flavor, the supplements were okay. That's why I'm giving them a 3 out of 5 for my review."
4,Best paired with a more comprehensive guide,"While our cousin, an art-history graduate residing in Italy, agreed that the Rome version is excellent, this book attempted to cover too much ground with few 'secrets' to spread around the different parts of Italy. Highly recommend pairing this book with a more comprehensive tour book such as the Eyewitness Guide. It was worthwhile cross-referencing the books to make sure that we cover the top sights and some less-traveled gems.Thanks to this guide book, we enjoyed an excellent picnic packed by the suggested grocery in Radda in Chianti. We followed the book's advice to Osteria di Rendola and had an absolutely amazing lunch. This book provided some pleasant surprises for us first-time goers and gourmet lovers."
3,"Beyond Rome, the Series Disappoints","I loved City Secrets: Rome, the first book in this series. It offered lots of good, insider information on that wonderful city. This sequel attempts to cover the rest of the country (or most of it-- Chianti is curiously missing), and what is offered are hits and misses. Many major cities are omitted, and the book scratches the surface in too many places. Major Disappointment."
2,disappointment,"I should have heeded the critique of one of your readers. The complaint was ""after Rome the series disappoints"".However, I so loved the Rome book, carrying it about Rome, having people comment on the book when they saw me checking maps or sights, finding kindred spirits who also had the book and so on. It was truly my favorite travel guide/book of Rome.So, ignoring advice, I ordered the Florence edition, realizing that Florence was just a part of the book...but I would never have dreamt it would be THAT small of a part.True, Florence is much smaller than Rome, but the city is filled with so much beauty, art and architecture that surely a book dedicated to it's ""secrets"" would have been worth the effort."
4,"In a world of pop, good rock is hard to find.",A strong rock base with excellent rythms. Nostalgia Café and Handsome Girls have the strongest and most evocative lyrics. I hope to see this group succeed and hopefully come to Europe on a tour.
5,60's meets turn of the millenium rock,"Bitter is a band that proves that opposites attract. They combine an easy summery 60s feel with a turn of the millenium rock sensibility (Basically, it rocks!!). The music always blends together to make you feel good and want to rock into the future of good, honest, rock -n- roll..."
2,Entertaining but horribly flawed,"No SR or GR claims have ever been counter-demonstrated and this book displays a lack of comprehension of basic Physics. The admitted lack of knowledge of the many standard paradoxes is evident with instances of rookie frame jumping. The doppler shift conclusion and simultaneity proof are both wrong. The only possible way to assault relativity, given its mathematical self-consistency, is externally by empirically invalidating a postulate. The model still remains error-free, however it also remains open to a demonstration of not capturing reality. Meanwhile the orbital precession of Mercury, relativistic correction of the GPS satellite system and Fermi Lab's particle beams are all in compliance.Those more knowledgeable of Physics look for a more inclusive theory."
2,BUH!,"The packaging for this 2 disc set is actually better than the music on the album itself. I don't consider this a musthave and it's only interesting if you've heard all their otheralbums. The photos are great, actually and the liner notes arevery informative, but the only two worthwhile tracks are ""Free-dom's Child"" and ""Bringing Me Down"". If listening to demo ver-sions of GG songs is your idea of a good time, then I recommendthis album, otherwise avoid it."
5,Fun if you want to learn German,"My daughter is learning German in hopes of goingthere someday and this has been very helpful to her.Lot of fun for recreational learning, too."
4,Yay German fridge magnets!,"The magnets are great, but were packaged with the ITALIAN phrase / word pamphlet. Helpful? Not so much. I'll be looking up cool words/phrases on the internet."
4,Elegant but limiting,"Nice snug hold for your Treo and high quality construction & feel; however, don't plan on using most of the device functions while it is in the cradle. The holster prevents you from opening the lid, accessing the jog dial, or accessing the outer function buttons while the Treo is in it. You can however put the phone in the holster with the lid open if you need to access the screen (e.g. I use this holster as part of my car mount). The buttons you can easily access include the up/down buttons for declining calls and the power/volume switches on top. Overall a very classy design for most purposes."
2,Works ...... but could be much better --- Keep looking,"The clip is better than what came with my Treo 300, that is nothing. However, the design could have been much better, like being able to use the flip top without removing it from the ""holster."""
1,Unbelivable,"I bougt one of this product from ""BARGAINDEPOT""on ebay,it never lasted for 2hours before it broke off,am soo devasteted by this.When i hooked it to my belt and sat down in my car and position it in a better way,because of it not breaking,on getting down this case snap out and broke apart from the clip and that's it."
3,Not Bad.,"I've been using this now for about two weeks. I'm pretty pleased with it. It popped off my belt once, but I think it was my fault.The Treo is somewhat differently sized than a standard cell phone, so design of this product might be considered awkward. I like being able to rotate the device when I sit down so it doesn't scrunch.I'm a bit worried about the exposed screen, and there's no place to store the ear-peice, so I just leave it in my car.There's no better product out there right now, though...and this beats putting it in your pocket."
2,Too Expensive for what it is,"VERY bulky and also somewhat inconvenient. Does not protect the face of your Treo at all as it is outwardly exposed. Very limited in functions that can be accessed while in the ""clip"". OK, you can see the screen but can't do much about it without snapping the whole thing out of the holder and opening the lid. The soft case is equally expensive and not well-thought out. Can't wait for the aftermarket cases to appear from a company that has thought more about the product before rushing it to market and prices them at a reasonable level."
2,Nice in closer,"Sub arrived with the grill pushed in, quick fix. Hooked it up to my Alpine V12 lasted one day and I was only pushing 300 watts to it. I like the tube in closer, spend the money on a upgraded sub and you'll be fine."
3,just ok,"Very muddy sounding bass. The enclosure itself though is pretty good, but you definately would want to buy another sub."
5,Perfect book,This book is perfect! I gave it as a baby shower gift and it had a generous amount of room inside the front cover where I could write an inscription to the baby. I'm sure he'll love the book!
3,great story but such a bad Italian!,How can you translante Nona with Grandma? The right word is Nonna not Nona. Don't use words that you don't know or at least use an effective translator!
3,Strega Nona the Witch,"I like this book alot, i think it's pretty fun. It's has a lesson to be learned....My 3 year old does really like this book very much though. He prefers to read Olivia."
4,My kids enjoyed the story,When my daughter's (ages 5 and 6) heard this book was their principal's favorite they asked me to buy the book. They both enjoyed the book and my oldest daughter wrote her summer book report on this book. They are looking forward to having the rest of the series read to them and hopefully to me someday.
5,De Paola's Best Yet,"Strega Nona (Grandma Witch) is about the beloved character with the same name. She lives in a small town in Italy, where she cures sickness and warts. When she hires Big Anthony to help her, trouble starts. When Anthony sees her through the window making pasta by chanting a few words, he tries while she is on a trip to see a friend. Kids will enjoy the humorous ending and classic illustrations. (...)"
3,"Still incorrect, Amazon","I contacted Amazon months ago about this listing. The 708482K is the Jet Proshop hybrid saw. As of today, they have:1) created a new listing for the Proshop saw (do a search on 708482k to see both)2) updated only the picture of the saw in this listing. All other information applies to a different saw.Don't order until Amazon gets it's act together. Who knows what saw you'll get?"
1,Buyer Beware,"After reading the review by ""pompous windbag,"" I was hesitant to order this saw from Amazon. I should have been more hesitant. Amazon failed to respond to my first email (sent right after I ordered the saw) asking them to confirm that I would in fact be receiving the 708482K. The saw delivered was NOT the 708482K. After calling customer service and asking AGAIN for Amazon to confirm that the saw they were RE-SENDING would be the 708482K, I received a form letter response. I sent another email asking for a confirmation and got yet another form letter response. It is readily apparent, that in an effort to save costs, Amazon, to their detriment, relies more on technology to solve customer problems that require human beings. Still without the correct saw..."
1,"Vague, misleading product descriptions.","BUYER BEWARE: Vague, misleading product descriptions. Poor (no) communication. First and last order with this seller, AC-Direct.I was hesitant to purchase from Amazon or AC-Direct because of the vague description of the product and their skirting around specifications. I sent an email to confirm certain criteria about the product but it went unanswered. Unfortunately, I took a chance and ordered the product after 3 days waiting out of vehicle necessity and what actually arrived was an incomplete fuel pump assembly. Basically useless without the fuel sending unit attached. I give them credit that they did ship it fast, however; if I can't use it does it really matter?I've once again emailed AC-Direct requesting a complete assembly or refund. I fear my attempts at communication will once again fall upon death ears."
2,Just okay,"For six years Molly Blume has been consumed by the unsolved murder of her best friend Angie. When the police inform Molly that they have found her friend's killer, the story begins to come to life. Even though the police have closed the case Molly is not convinced that they have the right man. She starts her own investigation and ends up uncovering more than a random mugging.Molly Blume is a very likable and strong main character. But good character development is not enough to carry a novel. I was able to figure out the ending long before the conclusion of the book. It's a nice story but not gripping. I was a little disappointing after all the hype."
2,Very good performance in terrible sound.,"This very good (four star) performance, led by De Sabata, features fine women soloists and a tenor and bass - Di Stefano and Siepi - who are superb. These gentlemen also recorded the Verdi Requiem with Toscanini. They are just as good, if not better, here. I have the performance on LP, missed it when it came out on EMI's References label and so picked this Opera D'Oro up. The sound is painfully awful(minus two stars, minimum...): the chorus and soloists sound as though they are under water and the orchestra can barely be heard though a veil of noise. Pitch fluctuates from moment to moment. Terrible.I recently found this performance on the Naxos Historical label (Europe) and bought it at once. The remastering is a miracle: crisp clean sound with depth and presence. Heard in this way the performance is powerful. So - avoid the Opera D'Oro and look for the Naxos."
5,Great analysis,"The book is a great analysis of the issues that will face a Post-Castro Cuba. An interesting and informative read that should be required for anyone that pretends to be serious about studying and learning about the situation in Cuba. As a Cuban-American born in Cuba, the book confirmed much of what we know about the island, but adds analysis and unites all the issues under one over-arching perspective. Great read."
2,Solid feel belies its fragility,"This stylus is nice and heavy for its size and is comfortable to use. Like another reviewer, the tip of mine broke off when I dropped the stylus from desk height. Since no third-party stylii fit the Treo, I was forced to backorder this expensive 3-pack. I am still waiting for it to arrive."
3,"watchmakers, comp 21stC guide.","This book has long been a valuable research tool for amateur and pro horlogists alike. I fall into the first category and therefore need all the help I can get. I think this book is fantastic. It has already helped me identify dudds and bargains. It was not a cheap book but with time it will more than pay for itself.Very satisfied customer,Trevor Crawford. 1/06/09"
4,Well Worth The Price of Admission,"Rescue Dawn is not by any stretch of the imagination a film that will change your life. The plot line has been done repeatedly and is fairly predictable. Dieter Dengler, a U.S. Navy pilot, is shot down over Laos at the beginning of the Vietnam War while on a secret mission. From that point the plot follows the usual route. Capture, torture, escape, evasion and finally... well, I can't tell you the ending now can I? But for all of that Rescue Dawn held my attention, drew several cringes and even managed to trigger the old gag reflex a time or two. Let's just say food was scarce. I don't know that I would ever buy this DVD, but it was overall an entertaining rental and if you enjoy movies in this genre, I expect you will enjoy this one as well."
3,Good War movie - Inspiring,"Great distributor and shipping product was wonderful - arrived in pristine condition well packaged. Content: Dieter, a real person which this movie is based on, is an inspiring person. This is an good movie, a good war movie with a great inspirational theme and don't give up attitude. I like a little more detail and action than this movie provides, but the story line is good and entertaining. The director's comments are my favorite and the deleted scenes - they should've kept them in. Good movie, and entertaining. If you like this type of story, no gore, blood or excesses -you'll like this movie."
3,Rescue me!!!,"A little too silly at times for a war movie. Since this is based on a true story, maybe the real-life guy was kind of strange, too. The acting is OK and the cinematography is excellent."
2,Not worth the price,"Christian Bale did the best he could with this script. The direction was plodding. The movie went on far too long. Technically the film was flawed. They mentioned USS Ranger as the carrier in the movie. They shot the exteriors on a modern amphibious warfare ship. They were using the wrong helo's in the film. I believe I spotted, during the hanger bay scences, a sailor wearing an Enlisted Surface Warfare pin. That award had not been created until the late 70's.Watch the original documentary. It is much better."
4,"If you want nonstop action, go elsewhere...","I decided to pick up Rescue Dawn on Blu-ray as a blind buy after reading so many positive reviews of the film. Overall, I was not disappointed!First off, trailers for the DVD on television will make the movie appear to be packed with action. It's not. It's a character driven drama more than anything else, so if that's not what you're looking for go snatch up Die Hard 4 (another great movie). What I found truly compelling is that you could see the characters' actual physical and mental changes throughout the story - especially Christian Bale's - and thus feel more emotionally attached to the characters and their fates. Aside from the story itself, the movie looks beautiful in high definition (lots of lush green jungle scenes) and is very tastefully shot. The sound is quite nice, too, although I don't have an audio rig capable of playing the DTS-HD soundtrack.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this to fans of drama or war movies."
5,This movie is heavy!,"This movie is heavy! Based on the true story of Navy pilot LT Dieter Dengler from the USS Ranger whose plane went down in 1965--this was interesting to watch. It shows him trying to evade the enemy in Laos, getting captured, tortured, imprisoned for 5 months, escaping/surviving the jungle and being rescued 23 days later.If you have a weak stomach be prepared to see him and others eating bugs for protein. Worse part for me was when he caught a snake and ate it.Dieter is said to be the only pilot who escaped from a POW camp during the Vietnam War. I wish I had met him while he was alive!Have tissue ready for the last 15 minutes of the movie!"
4,Rescue Dawn review,Pretty good movie. I really enjoyed the fast pace action throughout the film. The movie came to me promptly and was in excellent shape with no scratches. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys war movies.
4,One of Christian Bale's best performances,"Real tale of a Vietnam pilot who gets shot down, captured and escapes. Amazing performances from Christian Bale and the entire cast. It makes me want to watch the directors other movies that I've been hearing about ('Fitzcarraldo' and 'Aguirre' are the most highly regarded, I'll have to see them sometime)."
3,Average movie...,"incredible true story. Well acted, but we've seen similar before. What's different are the details. This man's determination and courage should be seen by all."
4,I'm now officially on the Bale bandwagon,"He was great in Batman Begins, now he's great in Rescue Dawn. Good movie."
1,Disappointed,We bought this because of Christian Bale being I it but it was awful. It went on and on and was depressing.
2,Rescue Dawn,"While the story is true and the writer/producer/director captures many true details, this remake is one of the worst movies about Viet Nam I have ever seen. The hero, the late Dieter Dengler, is a true life iconic US Navy hero with an absolutely remakable story of mental preparation, bravery, escape, evasion and rescue. He was a legend when I was a new Navy pilot. Unfortunately, this is one of Christian Bale's worst acting jobs and the pervasive terrible technical details like the silly uniforms and the wrong helicopters really detract from the story line. Not all the details were accurate, like the passport in the boot. It should have been a German passport.Still, everyone should probably either read about Dengler or watch this movie for it's historic significance, if nothing else. It's just really too bad it wasn't done better with a real budget.Tom Ballou, CAPT. USN (ret.)"
2,Just found it boring,"Various low ratings talk about accuracy, etc. I just found the moving boring and not at all interesting. Some ""official"" editorial comments talk about The Great Escape. This movie is not even close to that in terms of interest."
4,A well made POW film,"I liked Rescue Dawn a great deal, but it just lacked a little something to make it a truly great film. I think it was just uneven at times. Sometimes it felt realistic and other times I found myself thinking the opposite. Christian Bale impresses yet again (it's hard to believe he is only in his early 30's with all the great work he has turned in over the years), and the supporting cast is good as well."
2,Good story; Bad Movie,"The story this is based upon is great, and in fact demands a movie be made...but then...they made this movie. I am a Bale fan, so when the dialogue sucked, that was not good news for Bale. Worse, Bale has to give the character some character...expressions, accent, etc, which was really awful. Just looks like he is overacting. Zahn is great.It's too bad that such a courageous story got this crappily executed film. There's a reason you hadn't heard of this Christian Bale film..."
1,Rescue Dawn,I returned the item because I do not have Blu-ray. I did not know what Blu-ray was or I would have been more careful before I purchased it.
2,Rescue Dawn needs a Dawn Rescue,"This movie just don't work for me. The documentary (Little Dieter Needs To Fly) is much better. Sorry but this film lacks luster. I've been a Naval Aviation follower for many years now and little things about this movie that most people won't notice bother me. Like the aircraft carrier where they begin the mission. The island portion is a box with no number. This is NOT real. This scene is a victim of cheap and bad graphics. The pilot's helmets are totally NOT real either, and look like tank operators helmets. No pilot would ever wear such a helmet. Also the film just doesn't ""flow"". The story should be told but this film takes too many liberties. Watch the documentary instead IF you want the real story. This film is too ""cardboard"" California."
1,The heart of dorkness,"Playing more like ""The Three Stooges"" than ""The Great Escape,"" had this film been released in 1978, it would have caused theater-goers to riot not for any political reason, but due to its tasteless exploitation of, well, exploitation.Seriously, how does Christian Bale continue to keep getting work as a male lead? The only thing he's good at is losing weight and sneering. In all honesty, Werner Herzog hasn't conducted any great feat here either. In fact, if I didn't know any better (and I don't) I would think this bratwurst was just making fun of Americans and Vietnamese like it's just some playground skirmish and he's Bob Costas on the sidelines trying to impress the peaceniks.This film made ""Forrest Gump"" look like ""Citizen Kane"" by comparison, and that movie was about a guy who had the IQ of a shrimp's digestive tract."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER - cover is misleading,"First of all, Bale is an idiot in the movie. He is so stupid it isn't even funny. The movie is not even believeable. I mean seriously, burn this movie. The acting is horrible, the story isn't believeable, and it's offensive to people who know what the war was actually like."
4,"Fat, thin, fat, thin...","Rescue Dawn starring Christian Bale is an interesting and deeply profound film based on a true story. This film is inspirational and doesn't sugar coat anything that occured during the Vietnam War. Bale sure digs himself into the character, he's definitely a method actor, who could transform his body like the way he does? I've never seen an actor gain and lose weight as quicky as him, also watch The Machinist and you'll what I mean. Steve Zahn also stars and he is absolutely brillant in this, I always knew he could pull a dramatic performance, glad the director took a chance on him, Zahn is more than a comedian. I highly recommend checking out this under-rated gem!"
2,Doesn't live up to the documentary,Although the actor is very good this movie does not live up to the true documentary. TOO much 'hollywood' and not enough genuine story. See the documentary and then dis-regard this movie unless you enjoy the hype of Hollywood.
1,Not so much,"I don't like Christian Bale but because I like war movies I thought I would give it a try. The guy couldn't get rescued fast enough for me just so the movie would be over. The music score was awful, did nothing to help things along, if anything made the movie drag even worse. I could see what they were trying to accomplish in this film but for me they never quite got there. Simply tried too hard. Definitely felt like I was watching a Tom Cruise/Mel Gibson wanna be in regards to Bale. I found him irritating and obnoxious whether he was trying to be or not. Perhaps I would have liked it better w/someone else playing that role.It's quite the story and perhaps I would like the documentary better. At times the movie was cheesy, especially all the scenes w/his fellow pilots. UGH! Really wished I could have liked this movie. Rent it and save your money."
2,Disappointing,"I liked the premise of this story but it never did get very exciting. The escape was actually pretty easy and the survival after the escape was also on the slow side. All in all, although the movie was well done it just wasn't very interesting."
1,Low budget B movie,"Must be at least 30 years old!!! A RE-release of an old flick.Maybe for .99cents, but not any highter. BORING."
1,Rescue Dawn needs to be rescued.,"After reading the reviews on the non-blu version, I expected far more than what this movie delivered. It is very slow and BORING. This movie needs more than ""Blu"" to save it."
4,Mostly Great,"The P.O.W. story itself is fascinating without Hollywood embellishment. Based on watching the 2001 documentary, I feel Herzog and Bale capture the the essence of what and who we are dealing with here. I wish more time had been spent on how starving prisoners bond. It also lacks his first escape, recapture, and transfer to Viet Cong. This is that rare film that needed a third hour."
4,Close to being great,I had high expectations for this movie and for the most part was satisfied. It just felt like it should have gone the rated R direction for being a POW/war movie. I understand it was more than anything an inspirational movie about survival but Christian Bale's character seemed to take the situation a little too lightly. This was the major issue in the movie for me. Other than that it was a very good looking movie that I enjoyed watching.
5,My Favorite Movie and Guinesses as Well!!,"A movie which has received scant attention but which I consider my favorite of all time. In a biography I read on Sir Alec he stated that it was his favorite role.It is not a war movie but uses a military setting--post WWII in Scotland--to depict a tight drama between the acting commanding officer(Guiness) and the newly arrived commanding officer(John Mills). The supporting cast is wonderful, the drama tight, dialogue well suited to the action.I bought the posters as a graphic reminder of how much I enjoyed this film."
5,Excellent discussion of judicial philosophy,"Justice Breyer clearly lays out the differences in philosophy between ""textualists"" or ""orginalists"" on the Supreme Court and those who view things in context and in the changed world. It is an effective counter to Justice Scalia, well worth reading."
5,Interpreting the constitution's grand principles,"""Active Liberty"" articulates a cohert framework for interpreting the constitution as a Supreme Court Justice, responding to the neo-conservative ""originalist"" and ""textualist"" approaches. In it, Justice Breyer shows how he approaches his job by identifying the core principles the constitution embodies without being stuck in the 1700s nor moving from their grand intent.Breyer's approach is founded on the idea that the constitution was often intended to provide grand, aspirational principles. He notes the overlooked, but obvious, issue that most of the ""interesting"" cases that arrive in the Supreme Court are questions that turn on the relative weights of different parts of the Constitution, not simply in understanding one part ... and thus is the hard part of interpretation. Active Liberty provides guidelines for that interpretation."
4,Breyer's Theories of Constitutional Interpretation,"Justice Stephen Breyer is often the key swing vote on the U.S. Supreme Court, as the Ten Commandments cases from June 2005 indicate. He is known as a judicial pragmatist. He is also known as the justice who is willing to spar with Justice Antonin Scalia over how to interpret the Constitution. In Active Liberty, Breyer produces a highly readable book that can be appreciated by lawyer and layperson alike."
1,Road to Serfdom,"The ""active liberty"" advocated by Justice Breyer is another term for ""passive tyranny."" He substitutes his own personal moral judgment as opposed to ruling on the text of the Constitution. I don't care how Justice Breyer feels about an issue. A judge should not impose a moral viewpoint when the text of a law is silent. The Constitution can be amended as it has been 27 times before. But amendments are difficult to pass, as they should be, and those of Justice Breyer's political philosophy do not trust the people to get it right so they create terms like active liberty to confuse the uninformed. For those who agree with Justice Breyer I would like to play them in poker, with ""active rules"" which ""grow"" and ""evolve"" during the course of the game so that I can win every hand. You would be a fool to agree to play a game of poker with evolving rules and likewise should reject Justice Breyer's notions of ""passive tyranny."""
5,A mixture of science fiction and martial arts,"If you enjoy science fiction mixed with martial arts, as well as a book with plenty of action, this book is for you. It's companion novel, ""The Backlash Mission"", is also a worthwhile read. After re-reading the novels for the -nth- time recently, I'm ready for the (long awaited) third novel in the series!"
4,"Good, but not Zahn's best","This was a good book. A fun book. UNfortunately, it doesn't quite live up to Zahn's potential. Everything else of his I've read has a lot of gray areas. Not this one. It's just Blackcollars good, alien conspirators bad. This was still a fun book, and I highly recommend it, it just didn't have that great sense of balance that his other books, like Cobra, or Angelmass have."
4,A good fusion of rock-n-rap,I enjoyed the hard driving grove with the blend of rap. If you like something different this will be a nice addition to your cd collection.
2,Bogus Psuedo Hip Hop,"I saw this album advertised in one of the music magazines that caters to the heavy music listening crowd. The feature looked pretty slick so I gave it a shot. Some of the music is o.k. (at best), but I did think the rap was whack. If thery're shooting for being a heavy version of the Insane Clown Posse, they're on the right track. I must admit, they are funny."
1,"Great album, now, if I only could get it in it's proper form.","I am hereby advising any potential buyers to steer clear of this product, unless you 100% know what you're getting yourself into.I was surprised to find out that there were so many copies of this floating around now (not to mention that it seems you can order it straight from Amazon,) but upon receiving the package in mail, I now realize why is that.This new repress of this album is quite simply a pressed cd-r with crappy printed one-sided covers. Of course, I could try to pursue getting my money back, but I'm not about spending time to send cheap cd-r's back from Finland, so I gleefully shall swallow my loss and use this opportunity to notify any other hopefuls of what's happening here."
3,Warning About Using with Other Brands,"I purchased this item becuase it the description says that it fits ""many other popular routers."" That may be true, however it doesn't fit Ryobi routers. The mounting rods of this router guide are approximately 2 1/4 inches on center, and about 1/4"" in diameter. If you don't have a Milwaukee router that's listed as compatible, you may want to check the spacing and size out before buying.I am sure that I would have given it 5 stars had it actually fit my router :)"
3,Milwaukee Edge Guide,"This could be more robust, but for the price I guess it's a fair deal. It will need to be sprayed with a dry lubricant before using and the locking knob for the fine adjustment is under the guide."
3,"Works, but not precision","Works ok, but is not a precision insturment. I have seen better for the money."
3,does what it's supposed to do,"I love my Milwaukee router, so when looking for an edge guide, I went with the same brand.The edge guide was easy to install, and once the distance was set it worked as well as you'd expect an edge guide to work.However, I found the Fine Adjustment setting to be impossible to use. It is held in place by the same screw that clamps it securely to the rails. Loosening the screw in order to adjust the distance caused the guide to slip from the rails, which made it impossible to adjust smoothly and accurately. Knowing what I know now, I'd look for a different edge guide."
2,For Once A Year Use Only,"Far below Milwaukee quality standards, there is nothing ""heavy-duty"" about this edge guide. Made in China, crudely designed, you will need to buff the threads and oil them before the mechanism will even begin to adjust smoothly. This is what you may expect from Black & Decker or Skil, but to attach this third-world accessory to the superb Milwaukee router is ridiculous. A joke at nearly $30, at least it's all metal. The only reason to buy: it will definitely fit your Milwaukee router."
4,Milwaukee Router Edge Guide,"I used the guide, attached to a jig, for making flutes in the pilasters of a large book case. It worked superbly, by far easier to adjust than the edge guide for Craftsman routers. The only drawback is the limited documentation, including the lack of instructions for attaching the guide to the router base. That was an annoying first time out of the box problem but it is quickly solved."
5,I don't understand the low reviews.,I have just received my router edge guide. It fits great. It works as advertised. Fine adjustment is just that. You use the fine adjustment to slowly fine tune your measurements. The instructions are vague but you don't really need a manual to figure it out. There is a third knob on the bottom that allows for the fine adjustment that moves the aluminum t guide in a shuttle. You loosen the two side knobs to get it to close to your measurement and then tighten them down. Then you loosen the bottom knob (not really pictured in the photo) and you turn the fine adjustment knob. This will allow you to dial it in to your exact measurement. It is that simple. It does what it says. I strongly disagree with the negative reviews and I am just getting started in wood working.
3,Looks Good...,"Milwaukee products are usually rugged and reliable. This edge guide could take a lesson from other manufacturers in ease of use and accuracy. I find the micro-adjustment feature to be very difficult to turn even with the bottom nut completely loose. The rails that the edge guide travels along are not connected to anything and may play a role in the micro-adjustment difficulty when they are not perfectly parallel.This guide works and is not all of that pricey, but it could stand some improvements for which many folks are willing to pay a little extra for. I can't honestly give it 4 stars, but 3 stars is an average rating."
4,"A ""GREAT"" Legion and Hackman Flick","I enjoy action adventures....particularly the ones that came out in the late 1960's and early 1970's. This movie is FUN to watch. Sure, there is a formula here....you get the character studies of a group of ""n'er do wells"" thrown together in a French Forign Legion Regiment commanded by an American....Gene Hackman...and its FUN.It doesn't hurt to having Catherine Denueve for good measure and a FINE performanceby versatle Max Von Sydow. The story is also atypical of this genre of film. The Legionaires are ordered to defend an archeological dig site which has enraged the locals....Why bother defending it? The drama and action are balanced with some good studies of the individual soldiers themselves. It is a Pleasure to watch.What can you say about Gene Hackman? I truly enjoy watching Gene's Work. This film is no exception. What a treasure! If you enjoy Hackman films this is Very underated.A nice addtion to any collection.Atreides"
4,Do you wanna live forever?,"My husband and son think this is one of the best movies ever. It is certainly very macho, and in many ways reminds me of a French Foreign Legion version of the popular sci-fi film, ""Starship Troopers"". In fact, the final scene is almost lifted right out of Starship Troopers. A man's manly movie, and an excellent action film."
4,March Or Die,Good action movie with a young Gene Hackman; romance story was weak and unnecessary; ending was too predictable.
5,One of the best written gay fiction books I have ever read.,"I haven't been this moved by a good gay fiction book since Song of the Loon which I read at the tender age of 16. It is not dripping with sex and the characters live beyond the sexual realm. When I first read this book I fell in love with Chrome and Vortex. I actually felt like I shared thier mutual awakenings. I laughed and cried with them,and never wanted the story to end. This book deserves a sequel."
3,hybrid,"This book is most strange. Part a gay romance, part hard s-f, part philosophy.Curiously enough, it is the gay romance the least accomplished part. The author's intent was probably to stress how the love between Chrome and Vortex is inevitable. Well, to do so, he goes on describing undescribable emotions and on the long run, he gets sticky.The two other parts are interesting enough: the world depicted here is particularly depressing, a kind of oligarchy whose only interest is to deprive people of what makes them different from each other and valuable. The only possible way out for the main hero is to escape Earth, a sort of metaphysical death.The writing is professional, the author is particularly good at descriptions of locations. The story is slow but stirs emotions anyway.Not a masterpiece, a pleasant read."
1,I've tried to get through this book twice,"I like reincarnation stories and the like, but after trying to get through Audrey Rose twice, I gave up. I think the thing that bothered me was the author's attempt to convince the reader that reincarnation is true--he cites various religious books from around the world.In my opinion, a fiction writer should lead the reader toward a suspension of disbelief, not beat him over the head with facts and arguments. Little clues should add up that allow the reader to get lost in the story.I loved the ""Exorcist"" and ""RoseMary's Baby,"" but Audrey Rose just did not work for me."
4,This book has scared me for 20+ years,"I read this book back when I was in high school (1987), and it scared the pants off of me. Now over 20 years later, I still remember that book with fear. I love reading books, but alas, that is one book I shall not ever read again. It scared me more than The Shining, Cujo & The Exorcist together. More power to those with a strong stomach, it is a good book, but not to read before bed."
5,great quality and price,Loved this Cutter & Buck shirt so much I ordered more. The fit is very flattering for a woman and the touch of spandex adds a feminine touch. The quality is superb and machine washes wonderfully. Sizing runs slightly large .. I am normally a small but ordered an x-small here and it fits perfectly. You won't be disappointed.
3,"Better than nothing, but not great for air travel","This bag has decent construction and fits the booster seat well, but that's about it. For air travel, it's better than nothing, but also has some disadvantages. It doesn't do anything more than cover the seat--there's no foam padding or anything like that to provide extra protection for the seat against damage caused in baggage handling. (But what do you expect for around $20, I guess?) More importantly, the strap is not removable, and there's no way to secure it to the bag so that it doesn't flap around. This greatly increases the chance of the bag (and seat inside) getting lost, damaged, or delayed during airport baggage handling, as loose straps can get caught in the automatic baggage handling machinery. Be sure to identify the bag as containing a car seat when checking in at the airport, as most major airlines will have a separate handling procedure for car seats that might spare you the inconvenience of a damaged/lost bag and seat."
4,good bag for compass booster,"This bag is good for the compass booster. Although it does run a little larger than the seat itself, I didn't mind it since I could fit 2 blankets & a few toys in there (small ones). It really should be a bit cheaper since the material is thin but it protected the booster and I didn't have any issues during the baggage handling process."
3,It's ok,I was definitely disappointed. The material is thin and it's a bit too big for the booster seat that it's supposed to fit. I think I would have been better off with an inexpensive duffel bag.
4,"A little flimsy, but fills the bill","I'm not sure this will last more than a few trips, but it works well. The folded seat fits easily into the bag (once you figure out which direction it goes) and the strap makes it easy to carry across airports. Definitely worthwhile for traveling with the seat."
5,Super!,"My son and his swim team friends love this water polo ball a lot, they use it before practice and now want to start a team!"
3,OK but requires some care,if you are buying this ball and think you might leave it in the pool for a while --- don't. It doesn't wear the weather and water very well for long periods. Mine also became lop-sided and always sat in the water the same way; and showed the wear on one side because of it. If you are good about taking the ball out of the water when finished then it's a good ball I'm sure.
2,Disappointed,"The array of attachments is a plus, as is the portability, but the unit doesn't have the sustained power I wanted. It doesn't take much pressure to stop the tip. I hardly ever use it. One other consideration is opening the top/cover--it's very awkward. The clasp is well-secured, so getting a good grip on the item is difficult because it's so smooth, round, and larger than my hand can grip. Perhaps it's just my unit that has a tricky clasp."
1,Awful,"Do yourself a favor and avoid this book. Mr. Judis fails miserably to explain why political cynicism seems to be at an all-time high. A devout leftist, Judis relies upon formulaic left wing claptrap to support his thesis that high minded elitists are no longer looking out for the interest of working people, but rather their own self interest. He somehow manages to strech out liberal 'bumper sticker' philosophy for 306 pages, most of it mind numbingly innane. This book is an utter failure, particularly given that his book on WF Buckley was surprisingly neutral and honest. This is the type of drivel you would expect to see from some nutjob writing for Mother Jones, not the New Republic. What a shame."
2,Pretty rough,"I was pretty disappointed by this CD. I was hoping for the ""best new"" part of his own review to be accurate. Curt has nearly no vibrato and it sounds like he's running scales. He's talented, but this CD is a tough listen."
2,A small fish in a competitive pond,"If there were no other books for those desiring to learn to trade this book would be ok. This covers a lot of the basics but not as well as many others available. I have been investing in equities online for five years - before that in mutual funds that I selected. I'm now looking to start trading based on technical analysis rather than fundamentals. Two books that I would suggest that are more comprehensive and easier to read are Toni Turner's book ""A Beginner's Guide to Day Trading Online"" and the best I have read so far by John Carter ""Mastering the Trade""."
1,Awful!,"Bought book, flipped through for 5 minutes, found good use starting a wood-fire. All the info contained here can be had for free on the internet. If you've been trading more then 2 days you already know more then the author of this book. Just plain awful!"
1,this guy has no clue,"i have been daytrading for 4 years and all i can say about this book is that this guy has no clue. period!2 trades a day for new traders!is he kidding me? the only way to learn to daytrade is by daytrading. not doing 2 trades a day. but doing several trades.people don't understand that making money is a joke. anyone can make money daytrading. the hard part is learning how not to lose money. that's the skill. learn how not to lose money and my friend, you'll be the best daytrader out there.best of luck.don't but this book. it's worthless!"
2,Not Rita's own voice!,"I purchased this directly from amazon but had read reviews here. Unfortunately, I misinterpreted the reviewer who said Rita's own voice was unappreciated by Columbia, who used dubbers. I thought this CD would have Rita's own voice, but was disappointed. I'm returning it unopened, as I can hear the same in her movies and at least see her dancing--and skilled lipsyncing! The notes on the CD say: ""...while the voice in most cases belongs to other singers, the spirit and personality conveyed is hers alone."" That could only happen if one imagines Rita performing while listening. I'd rather watch the movies."
4,Stopped working after 2 years; began to work again a year later,I bought this clock 2 years ago and was happy with the look and performance. But recently the clock became crazy. At first it began to show time as +3 hours and then started to spin non-stop. I tried to move it around the house thinking it lost a signal - no result. After couple days of spinning I just took the battery off. Definitely disappointed!Update 11/23/2011I kept that not working clock on a mantel (perfect color match) and after about a year decided to give the clock a try again. I put a battery and the clock began to work! And still working! So I guess the clock was fine but something was wrong with my house location at that time.I'm changing the rating to 4 stars since the clock might work unstable.
3,A Good Resource but..,"This is a good resource for poets on the various journals that accept submissions. However, I feel Poets Market is somewhat easier to navigate and a bit more concise.Overall this book is a B. Buy it for the resources and you will need it for sending your poems in for consideration of being published."
3,Great voices for Manon,"Magda Olivero had an exceptionally long carreer as a singer, and this live recording of Manon Lescaut corresponds to the latest period. Although her singing is full of grandeur, she does not sound 'young' as Manon (by the time of this recording, she was an excellent Fedora). However, her interpretation of Manon on records was necessary, and here she is accompanied by a tenor who was also at the end of an outstanding carreer: Richard Tucker. The vocal problems are more evident in his case, but he still sounds great. Vicente Sardinero is correct as Lescaut, and the orchestra sounds well under Veltri's conduction, but the real show is the couple Olivero-Tucker. The poor quality of sound is a mere circumstance in view of the exceptional voices gathered together in this 'historical' recording. It is a pity it was not recorded fifteen years before!..."
1,Poor quality - finish comes right off.,"The first thing that shocked me when I started handling this item new out of the box is the pits and scratches in the larger tools (knife, saw, ruler). They looked used, even though I bought this brand new. I then looked down at my hands and saw that they were covered in the black finish - it was like I had been reading a newspaper. The finish comes right off on your fingers. Lastly, the scissors do not fold smoothly into place inside of the handle. When fully closed, the tip of the blade still extends outside, giving a sharp edge to either cut yourself on or to snag on things coming out of your pocket or sheath. I've never returned something to amazon before...looks like there's a first time for everything. Here I thought Gerber meant quality, not trash."
3,"Yes, a great performance, but there is a much better-sounding CD version on Preiser","This is probably the best performance of EUGENE ONEGIN on CD. However, this Opera d'Oro version seems to have been made from LP's of this mid-1950's recording. There is now an edition of this same performance on Preiser that has been beautifully remastered and reveals much more of the glory of this wonderful cast, conducter,and orchestra. The performance is treasurable. Buy it in the best sound available -on Preiser!"
5,Brilliant Performance!,"With a cast perfectly suited to the roles (my particular favorite is Lenski, as his voice fits the part perfectly), and a very affordible price, it's something everyone should have. The only thing I don't like about it is, with it being a live performance, (this adds to the brilliance and intensity) there are very occaisional spots where the orchestra gets off (Act II, Waltz), and there are points where it is taken slowly enough so the live singers can handle it. Other than that, it is a recording everyone must have."
2,Onegin Sings From Inside the Box,"If you have any concerns for audio fidelity, pass by this offering. Like the other Opera D'Oro discs I have purchased, this one suffers from wretched sound quality. It appears to have been recorded from vinyl lp to disc. While this can be done with reasonably good results, it has not happened in this case. The vocals sound uniformly constrained. The higher frequencies appear to roll off abruptly, which yields a dull character, as if playing from inside a box. If your stereo system is poor, you might not notice, maybe..."
4,A great book!,"The book is about a dog and knights. There are a lot of surprising details in the book. The characters are all great, too. My favorite character is Dragon the dog. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes knights in battle. Thank you Julie Andrews for writing this book."
3,Too sad Dragon is not Irish Wolfhound....,"This is a very nice book that every kid will love. The story is well kown legend of my country (france)with a lot of action and very good details of the middle age. Unfortunately, the author has obviously never met an Irish Wolfhound. I own one and believe me she has absolutely no idea of the power, strengh, weight and size of those dog!! Her descriptions are those of a large german sheperd not of a 75kg Wolfhound.If you are an Irish Wolfhound owner and buy this book for that reason, you will be disapointed."
3,10.4.2 warning!,"This game will not work with 10.4.2, unless you use the Aspyr-provided workaround. Here's what they had to say:There are currently some issues with the video card drivers in OS 10.4. A future operating system update should correct this, but there is a workaround that you can use in the meantime.In the Finder, go to your home folder, open the Library/Preferences/Knights of the Old Republic folder.Double click the 'swkotor.ini' file to edit it in TextEditScroll down to the section [Graphics Options], and add the line ""Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1"" (without quotes)Save the swkotor.ini file and close it."
4,great game bad machine,"Now I write this review without the expierence of smooth gameplay besides the fact my system meets and surpases most of the minimum requirements. Even with my low end 1.25 ghz eMac (with might I add a gig of ram and a brand new 120 gb hardrive) I expected it to at least run smoothly with the graphics turned down, I was wrong. I opened up the game and started a new game and immeditley it was choppy, I turned everything down, graphics, resolution, texture, everything and it was still a little choppy. I managed to get about 1/3 into the game when I finally cracked...HOW CAN I RUN WORLD OF WARCRAFT WITHOUT ANY CHOPPYNESS BUT NOT THIS GAME?!?!? Well the answer is WoW is better and unless u have a G5 stay away from KOTOR."
1,Did not work on my Intel Mac,"Although I remember this being a great game when I played it on my original xbox a couple of years ago, the game would not stop crashing on my perfectly fine computer. There was supposedly a patch released so that the game would run on intel-based macs, but this did not prevent the game from crashing.Worth buying only if you have a non-intel mac :-("
3,Intel Macs: Buggy but so far Playable,"I know, I should just install Boot Camp or Ubuntu/Wine, but I'm lazy.As it is, it seems to work pretty much fine ... but you'll want to have both of the most recent versions handy. The newest version is quite smooth and pretty, but there are points where it crashes and you have to (force-)quit, load the uglier/choppier old version, play through the crash points, and switch back. Save often.Fantastic game, though. Writing is quite weak at times, but it's overall a fun experience."
1,Trouble on Intel Mac,"Although there was a patch released to supposedly get this game working on Intel macs, the game repeatedly crashed on my computer. I remember playing the game on xbox, and it is definitely worth playing if you have an older mac, but not if you have an intel based computer."
5,Good product/good service,"I ordered this dry erase board for my daughter who is a basketball coach. When I ordered it, the incorrect UPS tracking # was sent to me so when I tracked the package, I thought the package was delievered incorrectly. I emailed Sports N More and was immediately provided the correct tracking #. They were very prompt and apologetic for the mis-information. When I receieved the board I thought it was probably to large to use easily, but my daughter loved it and has already used it!"
1,Not the original.,"I bought this product thinking it had the same ingredient as their other decongestant sprays (Phenylephrine Hydrochloride). It is not clearly indicated on the box that it doesn't contain this. It didn't clear my nose at all, it actually made it worse. Waste of money."
3,I bought it for the box and tweeters,"You get what you pay for so don't try to over-power this box , they are single voice coils and can't handle more than an 800 watt amp. I swapped out the stock subs for Kicker CVR's and it was a good buy. Even the stock speakers in the box were decent but not what I wanted , but not a bad box for someone on a budget or just getting into b uilding a system. I would definately dial down your bass if using this box , I only used the stock speakers for a day but it sounds like they will blow easily if you overpower them , but in general a good product. I might buy another one for my wife's car. For the price you won't find a better product, just don't expect DVC Subs , they are SVC but well made. I say 2 thumbs up for the money . I would actually order 2 for that price , I wish I had."
5,Leonard Horowitz,"One of the most uplifting, informative and motivational books I have ever had the blessing of reading. I have bought additional copies for family and friends. L Horowitz is an amazing human, spirit being and guide."
1,not authentic,This not a real military grade canteen. I was under the impretion that it was when i bought it but i was sadly mistaken. The reason that i had purchesed this was because i wanted one like my dad who is now retired from the military. It is still a good way to hold water but i was looking for better quality.
5,Works as advertised,Not really sure what to say except they work as advertised. I've carried mine in the field with me ten or so times now and they never leak and hold up well to being strapped outside my day-pack. Good purchase and a good product.
1,disappointed,Was hoping this would be the same as the standard issue canteen I lost but instead its made of a good deal thinner plastic and is much less heavy duty.
1,Leaky,"Knew it wouldn't be heavy duty for the price, but I did expect it to actually hold water. And it does, if you don't turn it upside down. I tried several careful cap screw-ons, to make sure I wasn't mis-threading it, but no, every time I held it upside down and shook, it dribbled water out. If you just need something that will mostly hold water for a day outing or to carry water out to the plants or something and you can keep it in the upright position all the time, it'll get you by. But for any kind of use where it gets stowed in a bag and jostled around, this isn't it. Even for a low price, something described as a canteen should be water tight.Update: am going to try the #19 o-ring fix another reviewer mentioned. Will try to update again on how that works out.Update2: Decided just to go with a small Klean Canteen instead.Green Canteen Stainless Steel 25-Ounce Sports and Hydration Water Bottle, Silver and Blue, 2-Pack"
2,TOY canteen,"This canteen is nothing like I expected. It is a lot thinner than the other military grade canteens I own it is more like a toy canteen you would expect to come with a cheap halloween costume. Would not buy again, do yourself a favor and go to an army surplus store and get the real deal. It does hold water and doesn't leak, otherwise I would give it one star."
2,Leaky...,"Not a bad canteen...besides the fact that it LEAKS EVERYWHERE!!! After a thin s***ty piece of rubber fell out of the cap, the canteen became as useful as carrying a full glass of water everywhere around with you. It also is made with extremely thin plastic compared toMy other good mil-surplus canteens. Not too impressed with Rothco right now...."
1,Amazon's New Point/Counterpoint Review Format Underestimates Readers' Intelligence,And it provides maximum exposure for haters who have not even read the material. The averaging of reviewers' ratings was sufficient.
1,Trying in the best of times,"Although some may think that this is an actual expose of the GLTB lifestyle, it is simply a simpering whine at best. The development of the characters is poorly exposed and the writing style is amateur at best. No true emotive potential is addressed and the the context is pornographic. One would be better served by reading a host of other sources than this one."
5,MORE GREEN,"They're already working on and planning to release a 2nd volume. Sweet. More Green Ranger, Dragon Dagger and Dragonzord. This may be an indication that the first set is doing really well in sales. Keep it up. The more you buy, the better in sales which means more releases!P.S. - Sucks the way the Green Ranger era ended. Tommy's my favorite ranger. To this day, The Green Ranger and Dragonzord are my favorite Ranger/Zord pair. But The White Ranger was awesome too in his own right. I just prefer The Dragonzord over The Tigerzord. The Falcon was cool though. Also sucks how and when Tommy left the series."
3,Needed remastering,I watched volume one and volume 2 and noticed the grainy footage on My Lap Top and TV I have Store Bought VHS Tapes that look better than this. One problem with SF is they never take their time to restore any of their shows and movies except for Starcrash.
1,There are better movies out there.,It was boring and once again but not at all unlike the entire Star Wars Saga the acting sucks. It's hard to connect with any of the characters even when they are at their most vulnerable state. It's hard to understand why movies like this become so popular and make so much money when there are many better movies out there. As soon as I was done I felt like running home to watch The Lord of the Ring: The Return of the King. There is also something to be said about imagination and the lack of it for this movie and most movies coming out of Hollywood these days. I would though suggest watching this movie on the Big Screen because otherwise all of the cool effects will not work and you will like this movie even less.
3,Not that Good,"Ugh. It bothers me that Lucas won't reach out and take the professional advice of others. Maybe it's an ego thing, or maybe he really thinks this stuff is the cream of the crop of film making. I don't know. All i do know is that Part III is hardly better than Part II, and only a few action set pieces highlight it. The intro battle is fun to watch, but emotionally hollow. How they pulled that off i don't understand.I watched the Clone Wars CARTOON the day after watching Sith and not only was i emotionally engaged with the characters and action, i was on the edge of my seat. It was EXCITING!Episode III, and all the prequel trilogy really, botches the opportunity to delve deep into the Star Wars myth. i've read a lot of the Expanded Universe that has evolved over the years, and much of that would have made an excellent film.All i can say if that they DO make more sequels, make them cartoons."
2,"""Attack of the Clones"" is better","This movie had its moments, but it wasn't as good as ""Attack of the Clones,"" which is the BEST Star Wars movies of all the six. This film looked like it was rushed. Hayden can't really act, and Natalie Portman looked WAY too contemporary for this role. Samuel L. Jackson was great as usual, but he died in the film. Too bad."
4,1128 Reviews as of now 4 star average,"Well, 1128 reviews with an average of 4 stars should be a good enough rate to get ANYONE who has not seen this movie to do so... and, who knows even, to buy it. For my part it was great. What happened had to happen. that it was not the way some people wanted it to be, that they could not see a true motivation for it to happen that way...well though luck. All of them are acting as if Anakin was pure and nice from the begining. In my opinion he ALWAYS wanted to go to the dark side. He didn't need more of a motivation he just needed an excuse."
3,STORY vs. SPECIAL EFFECTS,"Maybe I am living in the past, but the first three movies had back bone. I mean they had simple stories and did not rely on all the special effects to tell the story. Mr. Lucas told stories of the human spirit over coming great odds. Do not get me wrong the new three are good in the own right, but they are not stories legends are made of. Now, Mr. Lucas relies more on the special effects than the characters in this new set of stories. as one reviewer stated...""The man had fifteen years."" With this last movie, I have to say it is the least favorite of all the stories to me. episode three is the kiddy ride as that all the rest where roller costar rides. When I saw it at the theater it was good, but truthfully I did get up and get refill on popcorn and soda. Mr. Lucas lets hope you do better with the INDIANA JONES new movie. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL."
4,To sum it up,"Personally, I liked it. The first two prequles were an obvious dissapointment, but I think Lucas redeemed himself with this one. Of course, there will still be the naysayers, but if you were ever a Star Wars fan I would recommend this one. Some of the acting is poor, and the script can be cheesy at points, but let's not forget that this is true of the originals in some respects. It is fair to say that the original cast had a chemistry that it's quite impossible to reproduce, but what can you expect. I like this one more than Return of the Jedi, personally, wirth Empire as the obvious best film of the entire series. For any fan, finally seeing the events that led to the original trilogy is a thrill and it all ties together beautifully. There are things I finally understand about the original trilogy that never made sense to me. How Obi-Wan keeps appearing to Luke as some kind of apparition, for instance. Watching the events that turned Anakin to the dark side is well worth your time."
2,"Better than the first two, but still missing something.","The first star wars trilogy had less special affects and is way better than the new trilogy, which has all the special affects money can buy. What's up with that? The acting/dialogue was horrible; its obvious that Lucas tried to make that up with all the fancy computerized scenes in the movie. They picked the wrong actors to play Anakin and Padme. I had to buy the spanish dubbed VHS of Attack of the Clones because i couldnt stand Hayden's acting. The only thing good about Episode III is the scene where Darth Vader is introduced. I pray that the TV series is worth watching."
2,Medusa Dialogue,"How can you take oscar caliber actors, award winning special effects, and the most profitable franchise ever and turn it all into a pile of crap? Thats the mystery that George Lucas has solved with this movie."
3,Lucas should have made us cry,"The scene where Obi-Wan says ""You were the chosen one... You were my brother..."" should have made us all cry. There just wasn't enough brotherly bonding between the two shown in the film. Lucas should have developed the characters better and then Hayden and Ewan could have shown us a performance that would make us all break into tears. Another side note: If Amidala dies in childbirth, then why does her daughter remember her?"
5,Ep.3!,"This one has the best graphics. The old trilogy is very cool, but this one is amazing! General Grievous, Darth Vader, and Emporer Palpatine, Oh My! I love when Anakin and Obi-wan battle. It was sad, action packed, and amazing! You have to buy this! Battle over Courasant, Wookies attack, and the rebellion is formed. It is awesome! I hope you liked my review. Your welcome."
4,Tied it up pretty well!,"After all these years, Star Wars is redeemed. The silliness of the other movies retreats in the light of this much better prequel.Yes, it was sappy, no, it was not perfect. But compared to the other movies, it was better than the rest combined.I thought the logic behind Skywalker going to the dark side was rather weak, but...oh well."
5,OH YEAH!,THIS MOVIE HAS THE POSSIBILITY TO BE BETTER THAN FRIED CHICKEN SOAKED IN BARBEQUE SAUCE! OH YEAH!!!I HAVE HEARD THAT R2-D2 AND JABBA THE HUTT WON'T BE KILLED OFF IN THE MOVIE.. BUT THERE WON'T BE ANY NUDITY.OH WELL.. IT'S GONNA BE BETTER THAN JERSEY GIRL.
5,This movie is the best,This movie is the best Star Wars movie yet a Lucas keep making those bad ass movies.
1,Its a DVD Movie,"If one and two were beyond awfull what makes this one better? Lucas should have kept the outlook of the picture similar to episodes 4,5 and six. Thats all I got to say about that."
3,Better than horrible,"I won't comment on the fight scenes or the dialogue or the CGI, because I'm sure you've heard it all already.I will say that I have figured out the problem with the first three episodes: not enough material. If Lucas had just put everything into Episode III instead of trying to spread it out and milk more money out of loyal Star Wars fans, he could have just made a prequel, it would have been kick-ass, and he would be the god of movie-making. (Ok, he still is the god of movie-making, but he's now a lesser god because of those first 2 poopers.) In short, everything in the first two episodes could have been put into Episode III, and that one movie would have been better than the 3 combined were.And, seriously, can he not ask for help with the dialogue? Jeez."
2,"Bad, and Worst of All, Boring","This is an appallingly bad not-even-B movie, with nothing to recommend it but cool visuals which unfortunately go nowhere. The monstrous General Grievous character is never explained fully and serves no real purpose. I fell asleep several times during this movie (vs once in TPM and not at all in AOTC). Hopefully someday such fabulous tools as Lucas and ILM have wasted will pass into the hands of somebody who has read and understood great science fiction and great fantasy."
1,lucas is an idiot,"only george lucas could have screwed this up this bad. don't make any more movies you clown. and keep your political opinions out of your movies, it's an amateurish move when done in pop culture light films."
3,Jar Jar Binks needs to DIE!,One of the only reasons i saw this was because I noticed Jar Jars in the new ones but not the old ones and .Then I though hmmmm maybe hes one of the people Anakins gona kill and then I thought of Anakin chasing Jar jar with a light saber and Jar Jar running around like an Idiot screaming Annie Annie what are you saw doing .I thought Id see Jar Jars ugly corpse lying on the floor and Anakin continusly stabbing it going my names Not ANNIE.But I was dissapointed when at the end he just showed up at Padamays funerel i think hes the one that needs a funeral but this movie did have some good momement but the acting SUCKED.Kindergardon Kids could of played better then the guy who played Anakin.He was also crappy in the 2nd him and jar Jar need to be cut out of the movie well Jar Jar just needs his throat cut period! Death2Jar Jar Death2Jar Jar Death2 Jar Jar
3,EH,"this movie definatly could have been better. i went to see it when it was in theaters. i was very impressed that they brought back Chewie, but i felt that there could have been more to it. The way that anakin changed to the ""dark side"" was really interesting, especially when they put him in the suit after his legs were badly burned. this was all because of him fighting with Ob-wan. at any rate, this was a good movie. but i personally wouldnt own it"
1,20 year wait for this?,"It was such a great opportunity to tie up the films and end with a big bang. Instead, it goes out with a film that just doesn't work. Here we have Anakin, who is about to become one of the most evil people in the universe and will kill probably thousands of people as Darth Vader. Why? What would push a man into becoming that way? The movie offers very superficial reasons that fail to justify why. It's like the reasons were just tossed out carelessly so that the movie could get at the ultimate goal, getting the Darth Vader suit on.It really is a shame because it could have been a fantastic movie, and it just didn't work."
2,The Force Has Left the Building,"""Revenge of the Sith"" is a definite improvement over the appalling awfulness of Episodes I and II, but it still doesn't make for a good film. The ""Star Wars"" aura has sadly dissipated while George Lucas keeps flogging a dead Wookie. Three strikes and you're out!"
2,Extremely disappointed,"I've been waiting for this movie since I was ten years old, and here's how I'll sum it up:Long periods of boredom punctuated by brief bursts of monotony.I won't go into details since I'm sure there will be plenty of people who will dissect the shortcomings in dialogue, plot, continuity, etc.Bummer."
1,2 1/2 hour toy commercial - Awful in every way,"Horrible wooden acting...The furniture was more engaging then the actors in this film....No magic, no substance...just fluff."
2,Stupid Movie,Well to start off i wasted 7 dollars to go see this movie. The movie is the best of the new trilogy it still sucked. The acting was bad. There was too many lightsaber battles. The guy who played anikin skywalker...enough said about that. If George Lucas was smart he wouldn't have put hayden christianson in the last star wars. Bad acting/actors. It was like watching wood dolls run around. My advice dont see this movie. You will save the money and your brain from another crappy movie from george lucas.-The Movie Guy
2,"Shallow, Political, and Boring.","Star Wars Episode III is probably the worst of the Star Wars movies. The acting espcially between Anakin and Padme is terrible. Anakin has terrible skills at protraying anything remotly convincing, and the dialogue given to Portman is unconvincing and/or contrived. Although the fights are cool, way Anakin goes from 'Oh No! I just killed a Jedi Master' to ""Okay, now I'll go kill children!"" is well...rediculous. Basically most everything about this movie is nothing like it should be. We should see some really powerful movement to the dark side here. All we get is...well I'm not really sure. It just seems kind of blurred, especially with Vader yelling 'NOOOOO!!!' at the end. That was just terrible. Not convincing at all. 2 stars."
3,No spanish 5.1,"The product arrived fast, however in the features it is understood about 5.1 spanish sound, but is not true."
1,Nothing to say to this untalented film maker,"I gotta tell you George - you are not that talented. After the original trilogy, you are just squeezing your dried-up idea out. And one more thing, stop taking advantage of Star Wars fans - they are nice people, unlike you."
1,A terrible shame,"Lucas wrote himself into a corner. With the original trilogy, followed by Episodes 1 and 2, everyone knew what should have happened in Episode 3. Lucas had tons of resource material out there, stuff that he had okay'ed. But he didn't use it. He decided he could write something better than the established cannon of Star Wars. I think Lucas was just too big a man in Hollywood. Rather than a collaboration of talent as in the original trilogy, you get Lucas doing what he alone wanted, with nothing but yes-men and admirers to get advice from. A terrible shame."
1,PUTRID!,"George Lucas is to be commended for his original Star Wars triliogy. They were films with heart and soul that spawned beloved characters.As for the prequels...well, we've all seen them. A CGI obsessed Lucas trades flash for substance and blasphemes his own creation.SITH follows the prequel pattern: A product devoid of any trace of what made the original trilogy so great: great characters you could actually care about and an actual focus on them.SITH is two hours of horrible acting, dialogue, and editing. The final scenes of Vader being encased in the black shell we know and love are absolutely horrible and unforgiveable. It is nothing short of blasphemy.If you love and cherish the original trilogy, if you spent years fascinated with the enigma that is Darth Vader, don't waste your time on this shameful, pathetic insult to what should have been.I'm completely disappointed."
5,Sithtastic!,"One of the best movies ever made! The opening battle sequence is one of the most vivid, colorful, explosive space war scenes in cinematic history. Of course, I'm a total geek for Star Wars, so this review might be a little bit biased. But just watch it for yourself, and tell me if I'm wrong. Go ahead, I dare you!.. Seller was prompt. Product was in perfect condition. Very satisfied!"
2,How can anyone give this movie five stars?,"The story is ok. The dialogue is crap. The performances were half-assed (especially Natalie Portman's; she was forcing lines out of her mouth). It was a big mess of crapily directed scenes all put together to make one giant crap fest. The only good Star Wars movie was the one not directed by George Lucas. That's the only reason this franchise was a success. Give it up freaks, the movie sucks and you know it."
3,Show up late,"Most of the Hype you are hearing is true.The acting is AWFUL except for the Emperor and a certain senator who will be raising a daughter.The first half of the movie was just terrible, as was a good chunk of the plotting. The 2nd half was pretty good.Vader's turning was not believeableCan someone explain why Jedi who can sense all kinds of stuff can't sense what's going on at the key moment in the movie.Yoda still looks like a tribble when bouncing around.The ending is too abrupt, it requires another scene with Obi-Wan, hopefully in the DVD.The movie has to be seen if you've seen the others. It was not as good as the first, much better than the 2nd (that wasn't too hard of course). There is the slightest hint of moonbat but that was overblown.My eldest son loved it and considers my review evil. Kids what do they know."
5,The best of the three prequels,"I just said it, this is the best of the star wars prequels. Please do add this to your DVD collection."
5,"STAR WARS - EPISODE III, REVENGE OF THE SITH","ANOTHER QUICK, INEXPENSIVE METHOD OF BUYING A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT. ANOTHER EXPERIENCE WHICH WILL MAKE ME RETURN FOR MORE PURCHASE IN THE FUTURE.THANK YOU."
1,MY BRAINS WERE POURING OUT MY EARS,"Influenced by all the hype, I looked forward to watching STAR WARS EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITHS. Boy, was I disappointed. I know this DVD is an Amazon Editor's Choice and has sold gazillions of copies, but inside of ten minutes of viewing REVENGE, my brains were starting to pour out through my ears. This film is for prepubescent teenage boys; I can't see how anyone else could take this childish drivel seriously. Disgusted, I turned the movie off rather than waste my time. For good (adult) sci-fi flicks, try BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN and maybe FIFTH ELEMENT or DUNE. I couldn't help but feel sorry for fine actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Natalie Portman who must have been paid sacks of the King's gold coin to get them to agree to do THE REVENGE OF THE SITH. They sold themselves to the dark side. Don't you."
5,"The best of the SIX, yes I said all 6","I dont know what people are talking about, this one had more substance than any of the others. Yes it did jump around and move very quickly. I read the book first so I guess I did have a heads up on the inner thoughts of the Charracters.But hands down this one is still the BEST of the series. Now if you like ""kiddie"" movies than this one will disapoint. But I for one am glad SCI FI is becoming more adult and taking itself a bit more seriously."
4,just clearing up a point,A whole bunch of you guys are talking about Leia and how she remembers her mother. Well she is talking about her adopted mother. The one she thought was her real mother who died when she was young. So thats what she means.
4,"DVD is great, Movie was somewhat disappointing",I saw this movie in the theatre and was a bit disappointed in the way it was accelerated at the end. There should be a Star Wars 3.5.
4,Star Wars III,Of course it's good to see how everything fell into place. It is a bit of a let down to see this movie and know what happens next. Not alot of suspense.
3,star wars,"Seems to me that all three are in a hurry to get it down, and hurry home, had exceped more and got less"
3,revenge of the sith critique,"The movie was good because it was a Star Wars movie, but it paled in comparison to the other films, and so, was a little disappointing. It was necessary to make this film to tie the loose pieces of the other episodes together."
4,The begining of the past,"I like the Star Wars franchise, mainly because it's a fantacy that we can all some how iddintify with in our own way or you just like the movies. Whatever the reason for you to watch you just mite fill that Episode III was a littel thin but all together good. I say rent for a good time buy to collect."
1,Help,"Hello amazon.com readers. This video game just arrived in the mail the other day, and it seems great, but can anybody tell me how to skip the opening cutscene? It's been going for like an hour now, it's insane."
2,Expected better,"With alot of good reviews of the film I was expecting greatness as I entered the theater last night - boy, was I wrong. Ok, the special effects were great...but man, the dialogue and the story progression just didn't do it for me. I was BORED stiff, shakin' my head at times to the dialogue - wow, couldn't believe how bad the film was. I totally agree with the person who posted earlier that ANAKINS progression of going over to the dark side was just too quick and not believable. Bottom line, special effects were great....the story/dialogue was a big disappointment. I wonder if seeing BATMAN BEGINS the night before increased my expections - now that was a great movie."
3,painted into a corner,"This Star Wars movie is the worst since Episode Vwhen Luke's face was in bad shape from the bike crashbetween films. The special effects remind on more of a Japaneseanime than a Lucas film.You get the feeling this film was completedbecause it had to be,not for the fun or worth of it.It got in all the ""stuff"" it had to,but compared to Episode I or II is is a failure.I find myself not ""believing"" Anakan's turn to the dark side:the creation of Darth Vader."
1,"""Star Bores""","Enough already! The thrill has been gone for a long time now. Episode III is a complete waste of time, but it shouldn't erase fond memories of the earlier, far superior films. George Lucas needs to retire from filmmaking."
2,Don't believe the hype,"This isn't the payoff the fans deserved. George Lucas has somehow, again, brought out the worst performances in otherwise good actors, and unless you're super excited about watching two hours of pointless CGI battle scenes before the story gets halfway interesting, don't get your hopes up. It is better than the prior two episodes, but that's not really a compliment. After all this time, the (presumed) final Star Wars film should have given us a real sense of closure, not dissapointment and wishing for more. Thanks for taking our money again, George."
2,what!!!!!!,this is the crappiest star wars movie ever 1 we all knew what was going to happen and 2 the romance lines and script sucked let alone anikans bad acting (it was better thatn attack of the clone's acting but it still is bad) i thought the special effects were good and all but it was annoying seeing anikin go bad it took for ever the last duel was pretty cool though overall i was very dissapointed at this movie its still a good movie but no wut i suspected at all
2,"Worst writing, acting and directing ever","So, of course, you're going to see the last Star Wars movie. Be prepared, though, for some seriously bad performances. The writing and acting are so bad, it's almost funny. Almost. More often, it just kind of turns your stomach.Special effects are good, but actually not as good as you might be expecting. Palpatine's transformation to the deformed Emperor is especially disappointing. A few times the old magic seems to be there--but then one of the actors opens his or her mouth, and it's all ruined.Bottom line: go to see how it all fits together, but don't go with high or even moderate expectations."
3,Eh...,"I'm not a big star wars fan, so this was not for me.He tells me it's great and so I will put that on here.And the seller was extremely punctual and pleasent to work with."
2,George's Space Bonanza Episode III,Oh Anakin..Oh Padme..Noooooo!! YES I'm so glad that the circle is finally compleated.
3,Could have been worse,"Are the Jedi clueless or what?Lucas missteps by making Yoda's duels too cute.The script is terrible.The acting is wooden.There are some good moments that presage the original trilogy.The Jedi are clueless. Anakin transforms into Vader by following the Jedi principle of trusting his feelings. Obi-Wan says only the Sith deal in absolutes, then a moment later bemoans Anakin's ""evil"", presumably meant in an absolute sense - which, just earlier, would have been just another point of view. Typical Hollywood idiocy.But all in all, a decent transition to A New Hope."
2,Star Wars- III Revenge of the Sith.,"This episode is the darkest and possibly the weakest of the three. If this movie is being shown to children, parents should preview it first and fast forward through some of the parts."
2,A joke of Jedi Proportions,"It's funny, everyone you talk to who saw this says, well it was better than Episode 1 and 2. Well, yeah. but that isn't saying much.Sure, it takes place in the Star Wars Universe but shows little of the creativity, liveliness or spirit of the first three films. The dialogue is horrible, the performances are wooden and again the effects are so busy that you have a headache about 30 minutes in. Lucas somewhere along the way forgot that made the first three so much fun and that is characters you care about.The only thing that would have saved this yawn-fest is if he had let Lawrence Kasdan write the scripts as he did the original.Skip it and watch Episodes 4, 5 and 6."
2,Poor audio quality,The picture was excellent.But the Audio was weak.Muddled center channel the voices were sometimes hard to hear and understand.DVD states that audio was Dolby EX encoded but the EX tag only lit up during the THX presentation then went away for the remainder of the movie.Subwoofer was used heavily at the beginning of the movie but was seldom used after that.
3,The DVD Features are wrong,"The features says have available subtitles in spanish, and the audio spanish 5.1, this information is not correct. the DVD comes with subtitles in english and de audio spanish dolby 2.0"
1,P.U.,"what happened? Did Lucas get hit on the head or something? Why did he feel compelled to tie in all the later characters in the ""earlier"" movie? Wouldnt Obi Wan remember C3PO and R2D2 in Star Wars the original if he PREVIOUSLY OWNED THEM?!!? and why would he say ""I dont remember owning any droids"" ? Same thing with Chewbacca , why put him in these prequel movies at all.oh, yeah Ewan McGregor, he's a ""heroic"" type actor. I guess andy dick and the fat kid from Superbad were busy when they cast Ewan. Here's an idea, next time you cast a crucial main character, get someone who can ACT."
4,It's Star Wars,"You have to watch how Darth Vader loses his hand, and Obe Won's failure as a teacher. A good story told a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away ..."
2,Should you let your children see this film?,"The violence is no more graphic than in any other Star Wars movies, but there are more amputations here than in MASH. There is practically nothing of C3-P0, little of R2D2, and Yoda doesn't have anything to do until the last quarter of the picture. The Friday matinee I attended was packed with small children, who had absolutely no interest in following the moral degeneration of Anakin Skywalker. They were too busy crawling over the seats and yelling ""Shoo! Shoo!"" with their imaginary lightsabers, or dragging their parents (I should say mommies) to the snack bar and the restroom. I have not seen a less attentive audience since the Walter Lantz festival sponsored by the Eden Park Elementary School PTA."
4,Better than earlier versions,"IF you like Natalie Portman then you should check out this DVD, My Virtual Cytherea. Hint: Cytherea has appeared on the Howard Stern Show and she is Natalie Portman's evil twin. Check out Cytherea for reals doggz."
5,"""If so powerful, why leave?""","You want lightsaber duels? Well this Episode of Star Wars has got 'em. Loads of 'em! Lightsaber fights here, lighsaber fights there! Man, it just doesn't stop. Droids get it. Dooku gets it. The Jedi get it. And then Master Sidious gets into it with Yoda. It never stops!Oh, yeah. Also something about Anakin Skywalker becoming a Sith Lord known as Darth Vader.Seriously, I feel like a part of my childhood is complete with this final installment of the Star Wars series. Even detractors of Episode I & II probably will come out cheering for this one. Maybe I shouldn't assume this. I wouldn't want my arogance to blind me, not unlike Yoda. There are also some great extras for hours of viewing pleasure."
5,Awesome Buy,What can I say it's freaking Star Wars man it is so good buy it now stop reading and go buy!!!
5,ZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I watched this movie with a friend and to me it was da bomb. I have only watched 1 2 and 3. You learn a lot through this movie and you learn even more if you play star wars bounty hunter. I dont like the fact that bail organa dosent appear in the old movies since I havent watched them. Its a little bi fun to have a part alien ppart droid for a villain affter watching star wars clone wars (that shows on cartoon network) I thought oh gees Im gonna miss this guy in episode 3 but they put him in it.so mr. lucas well done.
5,Good movie overall,"I haver been waiting for this movie for years. I was not disappointed about the movie but some of te people who sad that it could of been better, only a few of them could be right. I really rate this film a 4.5 out of 5. on some parts of the movie was boing. Dooku died to easily at the begining. I was expected a better fight out of that one. The fight with General Greivous went down to quikly with the cyborg's many light sabers and all. Some of romance lines sounded corny. don't get me wrong that the movie does connect the new triogy with the old one. The way anakin went over to the darkside kind of had a purpose. every one is going to say different things about the movie so expect to hear the good and the bad just like every other movie. The movie still kind of bothers me a little on how it came out knowing that it is the last star wars movie that will be made. whether you like the movie or not I have no doubt that it will make its money but it is just the out come of this."
4,Great Conclusion to an incredible story,"I am a bit of a star wars geek...having seen the original in the theater when I was but a wee lad. Though there were some small flaws in the story the entire movie was a visual masterpiece.The Jedi council confrontation of Emperor Palpetine was intense, the numerous saber duels had me on the edge of my seat.Defintely a must see if you have seen any of the previous movies."
4,Looks Very Good,"I'm not a fan of the Star Wars movies, but i must admit after seeing this trailer, it looks EXTREMELY good and I'm actually excited to go see it. So if theres anyone like me, i would highly suggest you go see this movie, because i think we will all like it!"
1,Awful,"No continuity with the original three masterpieces, that about sums it up! George Lucas seemed to make up this movie as he went along opting for CGI graphics instead of a compelling story line. Never in my moviewatching history have I seen potential wasted the way it was with the entire Prequel triology.The galaxy, once vast and diverse, has been reduced to the size of a sandbox in a Catholic school. Don't believe me? Luke has now picked up four additional family members since Vader's shocking revelation in ESB. Count 'em out? Leia, 3PO, Padme, Palpatine (his grandfather). Disgusting isn't it?"
2,STAR BORES,"There you have it. Not one ooed or ahed during the whole movie. But of course I attended this Monday's showing to avoid the crowds but the movie was still pretty full. No one laughed. The audience was just as stone cold as this bore of a movie was.While it was good to see the wrap up of the a 20 year story line I believe Lucus was lazy on development and showed no creativity what so ever. We didn't see anything new, special effects are special effects. Is that all Hollywood thinks they need to give us anymore? Wait to see this baby on DVD and you can watch it in your PJs so then if you fall asleep your snoring won't bother anybody.PS I, as most others, loved the original three movies. What happened, George?"
2,Volume confused with quality,If the sound volume was an indicator of the quality of this film I would have to give it 10 stars or am I confused was that 100 decibels? When will film makers stop confusing loudness with story? I will have to try watching again with the sound down and the English subtitles on. Perhaps this will improve my opinion.
4,The best of the three,"I saw this three times in the theater, once in DLP. This movie should look great on DVD. I preodered of course. Come on November. (...)"
4,the best one in the new troigy,I saw revenge of the sith back in may it was good it was far better than the the first two in the new star wars troigly it is up there with star wars and the return of the Jedi if you have noot seen it go see it youi wontbe be disspoint i can not wait to get it on dvd in November
5,I love this,This is one of the greatest movies around. I loved it and thought that it was the perfect ending to the star wars saga.
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An adequate film, ""Revenge of the Sith"" effectively closes the gap between the two trilogies, but is marred by consistently bad acting and the inevitability of its denouement."
5,Just plain fun,"I've been a star wars fan forever, so this may be biased, but I can't get enough of these. Yeah, maybe the story didn't go as i would have wanted, but it's not my story. Just sit back, enjoy the ride and hope for the last trilogy gets made someday."
4,make an uncut version,"when i saw ep1 in the theater i was dissapointed so i didnt got to the theater for ep2 but when i saw it on cable i got hooked on it.i was at the star wars official forum reading up before i saw ep3 in the theater, so i wasnt too surprised at all the new stuff. I really enjoyed it and its the best of the pre-trilogy and i like it better than the OT movies. I was too young to enjoy the OT when it came out but when i look at it now, i do find some parts dumb or boring(in the OT).here are my gripes. grevious should have had more fight scenes that he wins so we can respect him. dooku shouldnt have been killed that fast. finally, keep all the deleted scenes, they were good.i liked the making of documentary on disc2 very ineteresting.overall not a perfect movie but only because it wasnt 3 hours :)EDIT: after a few years since release i think the OT was better than the prequels. i was caught up in the hype when this came out hehe."
5,Great Episode - But not for young kids,This is my favorite of the first three Episodes of Star Wars. That being said it is not for young children - is disturbing when you see Anakin transform into Darth Vader.I usually don't watch the extra features but I did watch the ones on this DVD and there were a lot of cool behind the scenes footage on all the people involved in making the movie - very cool!
4,End or beginning?,"Excellent wrap up of the earlier Star Wars movies. While the ending will surprise no one, it is well done. Could There Be More????"
4,A big improvement over the last 2,"Episode 3 is much better than the last 2. Anakin's slide to the dark side is too abbreviated, though. He is slipping toward it in a series of scenes that are played nicely, but then rather suddenly agrees to be Palpatine's minion when the Sith reveals himself. Overall, though, the series went out on a high note."
4,Star Wars III,"As always, a piece of technological art and heavy attention to detail. I found, of course, some parts (story line) unbelievable and wanting. But, again, it is Star Wars. It is fun."
1,Weak Films From a Sand Slug,"First of all, the ""Sixth"" do not even exist, people are speaking about it as if there were some omnipotent force out there. All of these movies are very weak and the mythology was ruined by Lucas' avid attempt at correcting everything. The two movies were awful and I shall never think the same of a little ewok either."
1,Crap,"I hope that it's not as bad as Episode I or Episode II.And I hope it's not as bad as the trailers make it look.But then again I also hope to win the Powerball Lottery one day, so we'll see what good hoping for things does, I guess."
3,Energy,"Alright look, i'm not here to tell you. That i am an angry fan, Or that i'm a fan and i'm appologizing for w/e may have happened with George.I read through the other Reviews and said, ok everyones either very angry or very Pleased and they yell about it.I'm here calmy, no caps correct grammer, maybe spelling errors. But none the less telling you that you shouldn't listen to anyone else or read other reviews on movies.Movies reviews are opinions. On Techincal stuff like computer hardware you should read the reviews. Why read a review on a movie? See it for yourself.Don't let anyone tell you how to live your life, if they try to, the only response is **** you."
2,W?ORSTT,"Worst Strar Wars ever! The story shines as always.... but the script, acting, direction and lack of heart kill the cinematicly dull episode 3!"
1,GEEZ THIS SOUNDS TOOO FAMILIAR!!,"Personelly, i am also a pretty big, but not the BIGest, Star Wars fan and i am soooo looking foward to the DVD releases of them in sptember. but ive gotta say, this sounds ALOT like the reaction that ppl had towards the Matrix Trilogy, which i also love, probably even more then star wars, lol. but it just sounds like its gonna be the same thing with this new SW trilogy, ex. ppl look foward to it, it finnally comes out, ppl see it with extremely high expectations (aka. Matrix Revolutions), ppl come out confused and dissapointed and ask themselves ""WHY!?"". i just know it, and i have to say, the only movie Mythology/Trilogy that has never dissapointed me was the Lord Of The Rings, Best movie trilogy EVER. This is my list: 1. LOTR's Tri. 2. Matrix Tri. 3. Original SW Tri. 4. (maybe) SW Prequels. Thats it, end of story."
1,sorry,i'm going to give this 1 a thumbs down for personal reasons i don't feel comfrtable disclosing over the internet. if you want to know why e-mail me at chikiwawaisgay@hotmail.com
2,"Better than the the other 2 new ones, but still not good","Sorry, but these new Star Wars movies are loaded down with not so special effects, lame acting, and weak characters. I hate you George!"
3,Revenge of the Sith,"Picture and sound are great. But can some one tell me why episodes 1,2 and 3 have all the deleted scenes not includedin the movie? Plus why are episodes 1,2 and 3 widescreenseditions in gold but the widescreen box set from episodes 4,5 and 6 are in silver? I smell that blood sucking Lucas is setting us up with a new version box set with the above revisions! It is beginning to be hard to stay loyal to Lucas.I got killed on VHS , Lasers and now DvD."
3,Not as good as I hoped!,Maybe it's my age (I'm 80) I think the story was overwhelmed by the special effects!
5,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"The galaxy is weary after three long years of war. Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi have become legendary heroes in their campaigns against the droid forces of the evil General Grievous. Anakin and his secret wife, Padme Amidala, have been separated for months, and he finally reunites with her to learn that she is pregnant. It is amazing. From the compelling opening to the emotional ending, this movie is simply amazing. George Lucas has given us another installment in the saga that is worthy of the Star Wars name."
3,Lookalike in last scene puts McGregor to shame,Wayne Pagram (sp?) I hear is the name of the actor who briefly plays Young Tarkin. He is so similar facially to Peter Cushing (the original Tarkin) that he is enough to make one very angry at George Lucas for not getting a better Alec Guiness lookalike than Ewan McGregor as the young Obi-One (in all three prequels). BTW to reviewer Tiffany: forget Hayden Christenson as Anakin. Hayden is sinfully gay in real life.
3,YODA ROCKS,"This STAR WARS installment is a bit better than EPISODE 2, I dunno, I liked EPISODE 1 because of DARTH MAUL, so I guess it would be on par with EPISODE 1.What can I say? STAR WARS is part of american pop-culture. Even if the movie is not ground-breaking, you still have to see the film, it is that important. EPISODE 3 is still mediocre when compared to the the original trilogy: episodes 4-6 but it is still a very relevant part of the series. The movie is a bit darker than the previous 2 episodes, the battle with OBI-WAN and ANAKIN was good, but a bit similar to Obi-wan vs. DARTH MAUL, it was enjoyable, but it still lacked intensity because of the PG-13 rating. All in all, Anakin turned to the dark side because of his lady love.It was an ok movie but you still want to have this in your collection. YODA vs. the emperor was cool, but obviously the emperor got lucky. I know STAR WARS GEEKS will love the movie, but I thought it was good but forgettable."
3,The filler,"I enjoyed the movie. I hope to see a director's cut, or extented version. It filled in the gaps between II and IV but, the biuld up was to quick. Many actors seemed to be held back by their script. Maybe a younger auidence will get more joy, but I will say it is OK."
4,Bush? Where?,"The movie is good...as a kid, I enjoyed the first three films immensely and shared the sentiment that the first two episodes were lacking. This latest project is much much better. Worth seeing 3-4 times in the old spirit of movie fun. It's just a movie, but I felt an uncommon connection that really moved me. Bottom line go see and enjoy it.Now about all the nonesense connecting George W. Bush to the film somehow...just a desperate and sorry attempt to disparage the President. At no time did I think to myself during the film, ""Oh, my God! They're talking about Bush!!!"" or ""Oh, my God...it's Bush!!! He IS the Sith Lord!!!!"" Nor did I see any resemblence of US policy in the way the Empire was birthed in violence. Check your history people...truth is indeed stranger than fiction. You wanna see comparisons that match up...try Hitler or the Japanese build up culminating in Pearl Harbor."
1,"Tiresome, overblown rubbish","I liken this film to the story of The Emperor's New Clothes.To say I was disappointed with the Star Wars prequels is an understatement. Granted. The effects are, as so many have said, ""jaw dropping,"" but that is this film's only redeeming element. Remove the CGI and what do you have? Ridiculous dialogue, characters you could care less about, and a plot that is as uninspired as the acting.You want to see good Sci-fi? Wait for this one to hit the bargain bin and buy the Serenity DVD instead."
1,Come on people...,"I admit that I am a purist. I love episodes 4,5, and 6 with a loyal passion. There were so many other directions that Lucas could (and should) have gone with the pre-quels and in this writers oppinion, he missed the mark.I'll grant you, Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen are delicious eye candy, but it doesn't make up for the lack of tangible plot and the poor writing.George, I'm sorry. But you lost the force."
2,Sad,"One ""top"" reviewer here quotes ""the Jedi code,"" which begins ""There is no emotion..."" Truer words were never spoken. It's as if the actors just wanted everything to be over with as quickly as possible. Many reviewers (and many respected) gave this film positive marks I suspect only in acknowledgement of George completing such an epic saga. This film however, on it's own merits, is hollow. Ewoks could have done it better."
3,Game Over - Finally,"Believe it or not, after seeing the first two Starwar movies, I didn't even bother to go see this one. The first two were so bad. This third one is a little bit better. It is an action pack from start to end. But that is about it. The acting is so bad. It is like there is no acting at all. I bet you and me can ""read"" the scripts better than any of them. The sword fighting is not good either. There is no style to it. The sword fighting in the first one is a whole lot better.I am glad that it is finally over. George! Please stop messing with our childhood memory!!!"
2,Poor acting and contact lenses.,"I'm an avid fan of the 70's / 80's genre of SW films. This recent trio of prequels fails to entertain. The young actors in this film are all too difficult to overlook. Their attempt at reciting this horribly written dialogue is painful. The effects are grand, but too grand. The scenes are NOT believable at all. I found myself yawning and awaiting my exit. Don't bother with this DVD. The ""EXTRAS"" are not worthy of the cash. What happened to ya' George?"
4,Good Movie,This movie was pure entainment. The dialog could have been much much better but the action was perfect. In some bits the story did not co-inside with the original three movies. I really enjoyed this movie and it's in my point of veiw the best of the newer movies by far.Hannah
5,SHUT UP BUTTHOLES,The new star wars movies are as great as the originals in its own way. People who saw only episode 3 are dume. Come on of course you don't understand it. If you think it is silly well you must be 80 years old and grew up watching westerns. SHUT UP! It is space fantesy and science fiction. Go back to your crummy hillbilly house!
3,nice FX,"This is one of the most visually interesting movies I have ever seen. I'm not a big fan of computer animation, but this was the first movie to actually ""sell"" me on it. The CGI General Grievous character is great fun to watch; I wish he were in it more.Ivan Rorick"
2,Better than the last two.,"This one was better than the last two releases, but no where near as good as the original three."
5,Great ending!,"It's a whole new experience! I understand that Lucas want to make it fastest to show us the real meaning of filming like a formula-1 race. In those races they showed us in slow motion the important parts. Just because its too fast - remember that!Hayden got really well! Natalie too! Ian McDiarmid just as fabulous and smooth as the blackest of the black! Even I was convinced by Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious/Emperor that the dark force was better... Out with the Jedi force!!!This one's the best of the first 3 episodes.Disliked some lines - too obvious!But great and fabulous filming and watching experience! I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! It leaves you breathless and wanting for more...Can we wait for more? Should we ever seen the Parts VII, VIII or IX? Let's hope so! May the force be with the ones who will decide the future of this galaxy, far far away..."
3,The ending could have been stronger,"""Star War Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith"" is the final enstallment of the of the epic series of good verses evil. While the special effects are the best yet, there some major flaws in this movie.The first one has to be the acting of Natile Portman as Sentor Padme Amadala Skywalker. With not much to do, Portman seem to stand around giving bad lines. Ewan McGeorgor is really good as a Obi-Wan Kenobi, but most of the action goes Hayden Christianson as Ankin Skywalker and he not very good.Fans will love, but I should have waited for the DVD."
4,Im only writing this review because of the trailer,I saw the trailer on my computer the other day and I must say that this movie could ACTUALLY be something that is QUALITY. Of coarse I said the same thing with Attack of the Clones. Man was I wrong with that crapper.
3,"better than Star Wars?! Shaky, your credibility is...","Look, I'll be the first to admit that the effects in Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith are absolutely mind-blowing, and that's reason enough to check it out...but better than the original Star Wars, like a few overenthusiastic fanboys are proclaiming? Get real. I admit it's pretty easy to get caught up in the moment when being dazzled by Episode III's eye candy, but when I got home and watched Episode IV on DVD, it was obvious which movie was still the horse to bet on. Revenge of the Sith without a doubt should be commended for arguably setting a new standard in big-budget flicks (I say ""arguably"" because Peter Jackson might have something to say about that), but, along with Episodes I & II, ultimately doesn't have the spunkiness of the original trilogy. Technology has come a long way since 1977, but gee, who woulda thunk the human element STILL matters in a movie? (raises hand)"
2,Am I too old ?,"The special effects are great, however that's the only positiv thing I could find to say about this movie. Maybe I'm too old (28), but it just didn't work for me. I didn't feel suspense at the fight scenes, the romance was not romantic, the jokes were just not funny. By the end of the movie, I was bored and annoyed, and so on. Anyway, this was the last time Lucas saw any of my money that's for sure."
5,2 words: Dark and sucky - for the warm hearted,"This was terrible for me the first time I watched episode III. This is partially about slander. Cancellor Palpatine has lured the galaxy into an order no one is able to endure. Everything he ever said about the Jedi ""invading"" the republic were slander. Anakin was a victim of Darth Sidious fascist mind and brainwashed into killing a huge amount of innocent children and adults that worked against a plotting tyrant!I gotta say... Anakin's turn to the dark side is just like the time of a professional wrestler gone heel.The reason George Lucas won't be doing episodes 7, 8 or 9 a rumored is because all six Star Wars movies were about one person and one person only: Darth Vader.The Jedi are absolutely not to blame for everything happening in the Republic... except one reason: Anakin should have been a jedi master like he's been dreaming. He deserves better than a mere Jedi rank... or does he? Who cares? You decide."
3,"Yeah, me too.","I agree with most of the other reviews: Not as bad as episodes 1 & 2; not as good as episodes 4, 5, & 6.For those who did not feel warm and fuzzy after leaving the theatre, I suggest this little Jedi mind trick: Imaging the younger, shorter, and svelte Darth Vader tracking down Jar Jar and his fish-headed family and lopping their heads off. Maybe that will be in the extended DVD and redeem the series. If this prophesy true becomes, apologize for the spoiler do I."
3,Fan :-(,"Yes the acting was good and the special effects where excellent. But it lacked any feeling of reality. Any Star Wars fan (Who's not?) should watch this movie and if they are a collector, add it to their collection. Like its predecessors, it is not as good as the originals (despite the bad acting). I think that this is a prime example of CGI gone wild."
4,A Shame it had to end!,Lucas does a phenomenal job of tying up all the loose ends and showing how Anakin becomes Darth Vader. Natalie Portman is as gorgeous as ever (she didn't look too good in Garden State) and the light saber fights are awesome. There is one scene in particular where Obi Wan fights a robot that has several light sabres in his multiple arms.The only problem I had was that the Jedi seemed to be defeated too easily after all when they have the force working for them they should be able to know when they will be ambushed. Only Yoda seemed to have this power but I guess he is the most powerful Jedi.There was a surprise appearance of Chewbacca and some funny parts with R2D2. Should not be missed.
1,Don't see it I'm warning you!,This movie did have a great set but the whole movie was just boring. I couldn't stand the dialogue in this it was just making me fall asleep. Ignore the reviewers they are just trying to give the movie critics credit and make everyone go see it. I really hated it and I also hate the first two also. The new Star Wars suck bad and I think the original is quite the best than the new ones. It was just dumb like the first two.
3,Good action - Pathetic acting,"The guy who played Anakin Skywalker was HORRIBLE in the clone wars and was even worse in revenge of the sith. My god, it looked like they were showing him the script next to the camera while they were filming it. He's got to be one of the worse actors I've ever seen. I could have acted better.However, there were lots of good Jedi battles with good effects and I think George Lucas has done a good job pulling episode 4 and 3 together - but I swear to god, if George makes another star wars movie, I'm gonna loose it. I""ve heard there still making another sw movie that takes place after episode six with a look alike of Luke, Leia and Han. I will just go insane if they do. He has lost his touch and George has to except it or he can do something he's never thought about doing and make something new. Episode 1,2 and 3 are a sign that says: George, the force is just not with you anymore."
1,"NOOOOO! I Don't get it, how bad were the other 2?","I loved the original Starwars, it had humor. This one doesn't. I swear I saw the actors checking their watches to see if they were done yet. When Yoda has the least stilted dialogue, the Wookie emote more than any one. And Ewan Mc Gregor's best chemistry is with is with a lizard. The fights scenes looked fake. OK and may its true that a Jedi knight doesn't sweat over a river of molten lava. I did not buy Anakin's motivation for going to the dark side. Well, I did laugh, just at the ridiculous of it. If you are collector, buy it. If not rent, watch it Mystery theater 2000 style, or take a shot everytime there is bad dialogue. No don't the last 5 minutes aren't bad. What a waste of wonderful actors and a story that might have shined."
1,Let's just hope Williams' score doesn't get hacked apart,"Attack of the Clones featured an AWFUL cut and paste and reusage of music - some music from Phantom, some music from Clones repeated over and over again. Let's hope that this being the final Start Wars film, Lucas shows some respect to Williams and let's him write a score for this film that remains in the movie INTACT.One can only hope."
4,Definitely worth seeing.,"Lets face it folks. Star Wars 4 was just okay. Star Wars 5 and 6 were great. 1 and 2 were so lousy I don't even want to discuss it. 3 however is actually quite good. Best of the bunch, not becuase of dialouge or story line but because of special effects not available 28 years ago. 3 does tie the previous movies all together quite well and I was suprised by that.I literally asked for my money back on episodes 1 and 2. I could actually see myself seeing the final episode a second time. Don't get me wrong. It's no Godfather II but it clearly does redeem George Lucas from his embarassing output of the two previous productions."
1,Why did George Lucas kill Padme off?,"I used to be a Star Wars fan until this.The fact that George Lucas killed Padme offis the opposite of what was said in Return Of The Jedi.Luke asked Leia if she remembered her REAL mother,and she told him that her mother died when she was young,not when she was born.That's why I thought that Padme was going tothe planet Alderaan with baby Leia.I have a guide to the star wars universe and itsays the same thing in the section about Darth Vader.Is it just me or did George forget what hewrote in Return Of The Jedi.This does not make sense and it makes thewhole durn story inconsistant.Just watch Return Of The Jedi and you willknow what I'm talking about.Scott"
2,If you are not a fan of the star wars movies then this is a warning,"My friend forced me to see this becasue she is a fan of star wars and all. Luckily i did not have to pay for it. The worst thing about this is the crappy dialog. Ed Wood has written better stuff, i found myself laughing out loud at some of it the people look at me like i was weird or something. The actors in this movie are good actors but not in this movie they are'nt. The person to blame for this is Lucas he only has directed like 5 moives in his long carrer. He basically has lived of his production companys and these movies ever since. Another thing why did he do the screenplay to this has'nt he learned his lesson when the critics trashed the screenplay to the previous 2 before this. This movie spend so much money on special effects that it failed to spend time on more important things like acting, story and dialog."
3,So much sound and fury signifying nothing,"Lucas certainly crams alot of action and information in this movie but unfortunately not much drama. Of course, most viewers knew the fate of Anakin and Padme, but it would have behooved Lucas to focus a little more on this relationship and develop a bit of sexual tension with Obe Wan Kenobe, than get into all the crazy politics that dominated this movie, as Lucas plays off Darth Sidius against Hitler, with Anakin used as a pawn. It is odd to me, since the original concept of the movie was based on Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress, and it would have seemed more fitting to follow the theme he set forth in the original trilogy, which was that of space age samurais, but Lucas seems to have become enthralled in the Third Reich, playing up the allusions in this movie and turning Palpatine into a Machiavellan leader bent on total domination. To each his own, but I will take the original trilogy over the latter trilogy any day."
2,where is Harrison?,"if this was the first star wars, it would have been the last. the acting was lacklustre, except for Natalie Portman, the special effects ho hum and the story trite. those things aside, my wife hated the lava scene. won't buy anymore beyond the first trilogy of star wars."
1,Most expensive melodrama ever filmed.,"It was the most unintentially funny movie I have ever seen. I agree with one of the posters when he said about Yoda, Enough already. Silly robot banter. Horrible acting. Pathetic editing. Worst lightsaber battles ever. A man riding a lizard chasing a coughing robot driving a wheel with legs. What? Yoda turned literally into E.T. Chewbacca, miss you I will. What? The overacting pure giddy evil of Palpatine was the best Snidly Whiplash impression I have ever seen. Grand Moff Tarkin was important in Ep.4. He was in the closing scene for no reason at all in this film. Isn't he Vader's boss in Ep.4? You'd think he'd be more important in this film then say, one unnessasary pathetic in the movie, buttkickingly cool in the Clone Wars Cartoon, chicken walking cyborg. Well, It's over. Thank God."
3,Ok movie!,"I am not a die hard Star Wars fan but I bought this for my husband who used to be. He said that the movie is good but it can't touch the original Star Wars movies from the 70's. From what I have seen, the special effects are good though."
5,It was the best movie ever!!,It had everything I needed to know it had the story behinde padme dieing and why Anikin turned to the darkside!!
4,"Great film, George Lucas ends the series with a bang!!!","Yes this is the best in the prequel series of Star Wars, after the critical failure of the first two prequels, and with allegations of selling out, George Lucas finally delivered a classic.The acting was the best in the film, the special effects were top notch and the action, the action was superb!!!Hayden Christensen finally delivers a respectable performanceas Anakin Skywalker. Ewan McGregor is great as Obiwan.As far as the plot, well we all know this is the last film before Anakin transforms into Darth Vader. The first half of the film is pretty good, but we don't see the full transformation until late in the game.Anakin becomes now full corrupt and joins the evil side of the Dark empire.Star Wars Revenge of the Sith, gives fans a great way to end the series. It's the best effort by Lucas and the movie and the series ends with a bang."
1,Awful Stuff,This movie was truly awful. I fell asleep during this movie. The acting was terrible. Serenity is what this movie should have been. I'm not exactly sure why people were so enthusiastic about this new Star Wars. The only thing it might have had going for it was the special effects but a movie cannot survive on special effects alone. I'm not sure that even Harrison Ford could have saved this movie.
4,Darth Vader is born.,"If you wanted to see Darth Vader in this one, don't plan on more than a few minutes. The real hero is Obi-Wan. This is a great movie, better than Episode I and II. Still the acting is not the best. However the storyline is strong and definitely someting that the die-hard Star Wars fan wants to see.Stephen John Becciaauthor of The Treelanders"
5,pretty good dvds,"There are 2 dvd's that come with edition. The one contain the main movie and the one containing most of the other extras. I don't generally recommend playing the movies with the default player that comes on the system as it seems to be lacking basic features (and it only playes at full screen at 640x800). I use powerdvd, although which player will be best for you will depend on your system I guess.The only real gripe I have is that what made the original star wars movies so good is that they were actually collaberative efforts. George has taken too much control of everything and this has made some of the cheeziness that has entered some of the dialogue of the movie. The same is true of this movie. If the producer had only had some input, I think the deleted scene with Yoda would have been great (which is on the dvd btw). Otherwise, it's a great special effects movie and the dvd's are loaded with extras. Most poeple, I hope, that love star wars should not be dissapointed."
1,Star Bores,"Oh, my goodness, this is not a good movie at all. I didn't see the first two movies about Star Wars, but I can tell you that this is silly and a waste of time.First of all, it's all about people fighting each other with swords made out of lasers, which is not very realistic--even in the future (when this is supposed to take place). Also, there are a great deal of creatures and robots that are not very good actors, except a hilarious fella named Jar Jar Binks (give that guy more screentime!)The human acting is really phenomenal, but lightweight effects and a not-too-well-thought-out story makes this movie too terrible, and I can't imagine there will ever be a Star Wars 4. If there was one, though, they might want to put Tim Allen in it, because he's hilarious."
2,All show and completely predictable,"The 3rd and final episode of the drawn out series just proves that making the ending before the beginning does not always pay off. The amount of predicatability leaves you relying purely on special effects and if you desire any intellectual plane at all you'll have to look elsewhere. As always the film appeals only to those film fanatics who do not seem to be offended by lack of unknown plot.All in all, just another sequel; but one where you know the outcome and therefore as a home view it is completely worthless. If you haven't seen it in cinemas don't bother getting it on DVD."
1,star wars is stupid period!!!!!!!!!!!!!,star wars is like soooooooooooooooo stupid! it comes out to dvd on november 1st. like i'll be bying it.it's way stupid! i had to but really this movie deserves like no stars!!!!!
1,How can you possible like this film?,"Let's not beat around the bush, this film is aweful. The entire first three movies are aweful. Lucas writes dialog with boxing gloves on, there is no subtelty, there is no character development. Hell, the rules of his world change depending on what he needs the rules to be. Verily I say unto you, these are the worst big budget movies of all time."
4,Hmmmm... <-SPOILERS->,"First off know how this movie ends before I saw it is kinda disappointing. Besides that the movie was very powerful and compeling, but lacked that magic that Lucas wanted it to have. The battle scenes were incredible, but unfortunally the worlds they happened in were not.(Hoth's snow is snow, Tatoonie sand is sand, and Endor's trees are trees not blue screen effects)The movie starts with the emperor being rescued and the introduction of one of the more interesting characters General Grevious a droid with a cough and a limp. Afterwards Hayden Christianson does some more bad acting with poor dialoge and begins to turn to the dark side over family worries. For some reason Anakin is appointed to the Jedi council while still an apprentice. Obi-Wan has been appointed too with only a few years experience. I could go on, but I don't want to give to much away. I will say that while not stacking up to the original it's far better than most of the movies being put out by Hollywood."
2,UPSET,"We all knew what was going to happen, we knew Anakin was going to become Darth Vader, and the Republic, was going to be the Empire. But the producers and the director could give the movie a better way to end the Jedis and the Republic. Make it more exciting. The acting of a Natalie Portman it's terrible, the film it's more an episode of a soap opera show on a local TV channel. Love me, love me not. Good special fx's like always, plenty of objects on the scrren so you can fix your eyes on something... The only good thing are the first minutes when the fighters are approaching the evil command ship, then, the movie and dialogue are so horrible. And we didn't saw the Mon Calamari, someone said there was going to be an under water battle. They said it was good but I was fooled like many others. As a Star Wars fan I'm upset."
1,"A simple message, distorted","Remember Episode IV? Good wore white, bad wore black. Lucas gave interviews on the writings of Joseph Campbell.This ain't Episode IV, folks. No magic left. Just special effects, and so many scene transitions you'll get dizzy. And if you're looking for a story, or characters to like, look elsewhere. It's like some apostles pasted together a tribute sequel, a few hundred years after the original was written. It's not clear who wrote it, why, what they were trying to say, or why we should care.Yoda did OK though."
1,Lucas = Crap,"I thought this movie was just plain crap. Compared to the first two movies, like the three newest ones it was crap. Hayden Christensen is just awful and like watching a piece of wood trying to act. Natalie Portman, who I liked in Closer and The Professional, is just awful too. The dialogue is awful. I thought the CGI during the space dog fight battle scenes looked almost like a video game and very animated. The origional use of miniatures was much better. I am not going to waste anymore breath on this worn out junk. Lucas just churned out 3 pieces of crap (4 if you count that stupid one with the Eewoks)."
1,"Awesome idea, horrible movie","Revenge of the Sith was by far the worst movie of the Star Wars franchise, it was an bad ending to an unsatisfying set of prequels. The acting, for the most part, was forced and unnatural, the dialogue was so bad that I actually laughed out loud a couple of times (my favorite line, paraphrased, was from Padme: you're going to the dark side? Hold me!) And the jedi all died like pansies, I mean did anyone else notice that in ep. 1 and 2 each jedi could take out about 20-30 enemies and in this ep. Jedi masters were killed easily by 3-4 enemies? Anyway, If you want to see a review that sums it up a little better go to http://boxofficemojo.com/reviews/?id=1815&p;=.htmIt's a good review that sums up the uselessness of the movie a little better than I can even though he didn't seem to think that it was quite as insipid as I did."
4,Raises a question about Hayden's acting,"I won't explain the story. We all know it. I'll just give my opinion on the quality of this film. I think the special effects in this movie are good. There is a part in the beginning where Duuku drops a catwalk on Kenobi. The body looks terribly fake and is laughably ridiculous. The other problem I have is Hayden Christensen's acting. I have never figured out if he is just butchering his role, or is his character supposed to be awkward and almost expressionless. I know that Darth Vader is a wacko, but this is ridiculous. Those are the only complaints I have with this film. I really enjoyed this movie, and I think it's worth owning. Empire Strikes back will always be my favorite though."
2,Suck Wars III,Ok it was better than Episode I and II - which is saying I prefer eating hard dog crap over diarhea- is that how you spell it? That being said there are a couple of cool scenes in this movie but I can't understand why he chose these horrible actors in this movie and of course there was too much cgi in this one as well - more tastefully done compared to the last 2 but still too much for Star Wars. If you watch this movie prepared to see a joke - you will feel better watching it.
5,Great Science Fiction,I would say this is one of the best Star War's movies made.A lot of action & even a bit of a tear jerker.Great! Great! Great!
5,JUST PERFECT!,"I loved this movie..Thank You George! BTW I just build myself a new pro-home theater, and I delay the ""Opening Night Premiere"" for this movie :) What better option? All of my friends are waiting for this! Can't wait to see the extras too!"
3,"falls short, cartoony","dudes, it's like somebody put the ""fast"" button on while they were makin this movie; there's no time to breath at all, and the action is all superficial, and... oh, yeah, what happend to Queen Amedala??? She, like, totally lost her backbone... is that what happens to broads when they get knocked up??? i don't think so. it was cool, though, how darth vader got born at the end. too much busy busy busy visuals. i saw it on the big screen, and my eyes were really tired. hopefully, bein on the small screen will, like, make all that background sh** sink into the background. someone got to keep those computer animators on a leash, or bar 'em from uppers. i'm out. j."
3,Pleasantly surprised,"Honestly, its more like 3.5 stars. I am not a Star Wars fan, but have seen every movie. Well, even I shocked myself when I found myself liking this movie. Yes its a bit long and the dialogue is still somewhat cheesy. However, the acting definitely improved over the last film. Even Hayden Christensen was much better. I liked the darker tones of the film. I actually felt some emotion towards the characters. The last battle between Anakin and Obi-wan was enjoyable and even emotional. I actually felt sadness for them both. When Obi-wan tells Anakin that he was like a brother to him, I totally believed it. It was a rare poignant moment in Star Wars history. I even felt bad for the corrupted Anakin. I thought it ended well too, despite the scene with the scream heard round the world... Out of all the Star Wars, I actually liked this one the best."
