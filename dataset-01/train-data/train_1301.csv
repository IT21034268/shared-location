5,Goofballs take on imagination,"This is a prable, a fable, told in simple language and straightforward stytle so that children can understand, but it is not a book for children, any more than The Little Prince by St. Exupery is a book for children. OK, maybe both of these are books for children. My point, incidentally, is that this is a sophisticated book, and there are many levels of complexity that need not be deciphered for the book to be enjoyed. It is a goofy tale about a goofy storyteller and his son, who have to travel to the moon in order to save the Sea of Stories, a sort of manifest collective imagination, from the humbugs on the other side of the moon. Throughout this short book there is a parade of fantastic and instructive characters. . . but Rushdie's prose is occasinally, for all its eloquence, just a framework, so that a maximum of vision can be condensed into a small space of words. A masterpiece."
1,Another forgettable book,The book is dull and predictable. The stories unoriginal. If you like subcontinental novels there is much better and if you like and want to support anti-Muslim writers just send him a check. That will at least save hours of your life reading this indifferent book.
4,Consistent,"Despite the unimaginative album title and cover, ""Lenny"" is Mr. Kravitz's most consistent album ever. The cliche lyrics are still present, but Lenny's singing is more soulful and he has finally learned how to incorporate rock influences into his music without sounding like an imitator. Best cuts include ""Bank Robber Man"", the single ""Dig In"", ""the bluesy ""God Save Us All"" and the pretty ""Yesterday Is Gone"" and ""Stillness of My Heart"". The 12 songs clock in at a total of under 50 minutes. More artists like Michael Jackson need to realize that the best albums aren't always 70+ minutes long."
4,One of his best,I love this CD. This was actually the first CD i bought of Lenny's years ago. I came on to him late but I am a huge fan now. A must have.
3,ANDREA'S HOT LENNY'S NOT,"My hot female friend, Andrea, lent this to me. I don't know about this. This is like middle aged rock. Uninspiring music. Doesn't make me think. This is like Lenny was radical when he was younger, and now he's accepted and the music is mainstream. Lenny played all the instruments, and it sounds it. You can tell; it doesn't sound like this is a band playing with Lenny. The music does nothing for me emotionally, either. It's just kind of boring. I liked the first song, and the rest is downhill from there. It is from another time. I have no interest in this disc. I really find this a waste of money. I have an interest in Andrea, though. She's 5 stars. ""Lenny"" is 3 stars."
2,SUCKS,"I love Lenny's music. His album ""5"" is one of the best albums of the 90's. Then with the release his Greats Hits, which included ""Again"", WOW was the only word that could discribe the body of his later music. So it was with much expectation and anticipation, I was looking forward to his next release. Unfortunately, ""Lenny"" falls way short of winning this fan. Most of the songs sound the same, very one dimensional and flat. What happened? Where did Lenny lose his edge?"
1,*&%$!@,"I was so disappointed in this Lenny Kravitz's latest effort. I wouldn't recommend buying it. ""Dig In"" is the only half-way good song on it. If you must buy it get it for the fabulous pictures in the jewel box.I'll just go back to holding my breath until he comes back with something truly fantastic."
3,lenny some dissapointment,"having been a avid lenny fan for 10 years i found the ""lenny"" album a bit of a dissapointment the somgs seem to lack the depth of say the curcus lp or are you gonna go! but by no means is this a bad album there are no doubt flashes of geinius in this lp too. the opener battle field of love is indeed testiment to the emence talent that he has lets get high will no doubt be a classic in years too come (in my eyes ) a great track. This lp is a more experimental one for lenny i feel so if you buy this dont expect classic lenny but do expect to hum a few tracks for days to come. One more point call this posative if you like there are songs on this that are a bit ""oasis inspired"" but a good buy for the less die hard fans"
2,just not there for me,"i usually enjoy lenny's work, but this album left me bummed. we bought the cd on a trip so we'd have some new tunes for the rental car. we also bought sting's new live cd and enjoyed it much more. caveat emptor!"
2,Selling out is never the answer,"I have alway looked forward to a new Lenny album; I have been a fan since 1989. This one took a very long time to arrive and it is a real disappointment. It lacks any real substance.Earlier albums meant so much. The message was everything. It was what powered the music. Understandably Kravitz wants to cash in. He began the process by doing a cover of The Guess Who's ""American Woman"" and continued with The Greatest Hits compilation(Usually the kiss of death for most artists). KRAVITZ-You should have put out a double live album! Selling out or not, Kravitz is still cool- this guy is electrifying in concert and when he is in Southern Cal, I will go out of my way to see him. Get back to work Len, your earlier stuff was soo right on!"
3,I Love Lenny..........but..........,"I think Lenny Kravitz is dope, I'm a big fan,but I'm not happy with an album that feels sterile, most of these songs are very cut and paste. I don't like that. I also don't like when it feels so fabricated for radio-play. what I'm trying to say is, i wish Lenny like many other artists, would bring the life back into music, because he can.but, i will give props to Lenny on him kick A$$ and if he's happy with his work, that's all that matters!thaks Len."
3,Typical Average Lenny,"I've Listened&Followed Lenny Kravitz's Career since 89&Not much has changed since.He still has that 70's Vibe Arena Rock Mode&Fairly Safe Territory.""Bank Robber Man"" is cool&a Couple other tracks are ok but on a whole not much changes from the Lenny Formula.this was suppose to be His Funk Album He Promised but instead it's a Safe Album.Vocals,Writing&instrumentation stay in the same Vain.but Give Lenny Props for Hanging around all this time but not much new to report.the Knock of His Influences on His Sleeve being Noticeable are still true here.His Next Album Should Be titled Nothing New Under The Sun?I Respect the Fact He Plays&Records with Real Instruments but aside from that it's to Predictable on a whole."
2,Sorry Lenny,"Let me first start by saying I absolutely love Lenny Kravitz. Critics love to call him a poseur or throwback to the seventies. Well, yes Mr. Kravitz may not be the most creative fellow in the industry - but he's good at whta he does and it's fun music. His live shows are downright awesome.It's unfortunate that his self-titled album doesn't come close to touching his previous work. The lyrical content is downright childish. His attempt to use sampling and effects have left him looking silly. I'm not sure what he was thinking when he decided this album was ready for the shelves, but it is pretty underproduced.The best song on the album is ""If I Could Fall In Love"". It has a nice super-sonic quality about it, and the lyrics are easier to listen to than the other tracks'. The worst song is ""pay to Play"" - I can't listen to even 5 seconds of it.""Lenny"" falls short of pleasing a devoted fan."
2,"BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.","Lenny Kravitz is back with his new CD where he takes advantage of his gorgeous looks on the cover.This is not enough to save this CD, in where Kravitz has gone to the mundane.Lyrically, Kravitz is still positioning himself as a New Age Post-Hippie, with predictable banal results.Kravitz produced, wrote, and played almost everything on this CD and it shows. Kravitz needs some new influence in his musical career.Especially with the first cut ""Dig In"", sounds like everything else I have heard. It just doesn't jump out at you, and it surely isn't jumping up the charts.If your standards aren't unrealistically high, you can count on ""Lenny"" to deliver dependable blase ""been there done that"" rock tunes in rocks usual tradition. And if you can' dig it- well blame Kravitz he was the whole show on this blase and boring project."
4,At last!!!,"At last Lenny Kravitz comes out with a new album since ""5""!I became a fan when I heard ""Again"" around this time last year and thought ""WOW"" so this is the typa music Lenny actually does! I hadn't paid attention to any of his stuff before ""American woman"" which I really like but before that I always used to think that Lenny Kravitz was pure% ROCK! Yeah ROCK...what a wrong assumtion was that?!I became a real fan when I bought his ""Greatest hits"" last year at Christmas time and fell for each track so I had 2 buy this!!!The tracks I like are-:1. Yesterday is gone (Dear Kay).2. Stillness of heart.3. Believe in me.4. A million miles away.5. You were in my heart.6. Let's get high.I can't really remember the other songs I only got em yesterday! But I'm sure there xcellent!!!"
2,"Major dissapointment . Anyone heard ""A Million Miles...""?","What more can be said? I think if it's not very obvious for the casual Amazon shopper at this point, after reading so many negative reviews about 'Lenny' I will try to add my two cents here. The album brings nothing new to the discography of Lenny Kravitz. If you have heard '5' or 'Cirkus' that's it: that's the best there is, and it doesn't get any better with this album. This is the major dissapointment I have about the album, which many reviewers seem to share.The influence from The Beatles, most particularly John Lennon, is undeniable in the album, but even so, it doesn't quite capture the listener. There is one tune, though, that I can't quite decipher: I'd almost swear I've heard another version of ""A Million Miles Away"" but I don't know who the original performer is. Any hints?... Well, point being, the album is not really worth your money. If you can get it used MAYBE, but then maybe not."
4,"Lenny Of Old, with more LENNY","If all you know from this man is his album ""5"", you may want to listen to his first four albums, or maybe just listen to his greatest Hits. Lenny wasn't always a man with dance beats and sound effects, no. He was a rock legend in the making, someone who had to ressurect his loves and influences to prepare us for his Debut in supreme originality. And it seems it was all apart of Lenny's Grand Sceme of things, because he did very well. As a fan of Lenny Kravitz through and through, i love this albums for all it's notes and all it's words. Lenny is becoming a master of his own destiny, and with the leap of ""Circus"" and the celebration in ""5"", Lenny is now on his musical feet and ready to conquer the world ""again"". I know that everyone will respond well to Lenny's true sound. And it's here in his new album, with the title to make you realize just who it all came from. Romeo Blue."
4,Lenny Again,"Lenny Kravitz's Lenny is yet another solid collection of songs from the retro rocking king. The album again combines his love of monster power chords, funk and soul, but due to the success of the 80's sounding ballad ""Again"", he mines that sound on such tunes as the great ""Yesterday Is Gone"" and the grandiose ""Let's Get High"". ""Dig in"" has blazing riff and is a great track while ""God Save Us All"" is a bit preachy but has a crunching guitar. ""Battlefield Of Love"" is a nice slice of funk and ""Bank Robber Man"" is also strong. Once again Mr. Kravitz wears his influences on his sleeve, but again has produced a highly enjoyable and credible album."
3,"What can I say, It's ""Lenny"".","It actually took me a long time to get into this disc, but once I did I found it just as good as the couple before it. ""Dig In"" is the big rocker here, and holds up well next to ""Fly Away"". ""Stillness Of Heart"" was another good track, and sounds similar to ""Again"" from his ""Hits"" album. I also really like the cool ""If I Could Fall In Love"", ""Yesterday Is Gone (My Dear Kay)"", and the smooth ""You Were In My Heart"". ""Bank Robber Man"" is about him falsely being accused of that crime in real life. Otherwise the rest here is decent, but nothing amazing. Ok, I do like ""Let's Get High"" too. Overall I'd say this isn't as great as his first few albums, but it's still good enough for true fans of ""Lenny""."
5,One of the best sources of First Crusade information.,"August Krey's book is an older but authoritative and exciting version of the events of the First Crusade. It is laid out chronologically with various sources together, so you can compare their versions. Much of this is taken originally by some of these sources from the original ""Gesta Francorum"" (The Deeds of the Franks) version in Latin, written by ""The Unknown One,"" a knight/monk who recorded his observations during the Crusade. This conflict has not yet been resolved, so reading Krey's book will give you the important background on this defensive war in the Mid-east. Hollywood movies are not at all accurate about this religiously motivated event, but this book certainly is."
2,"Be careful, it could have turned sour","I loved the taste of this organic soymilk and enjoyed ituntil I drink one that smells off. When I realized there was something wrong with the taste and smell,it was too late because I already drank with straw....I was breastfeeding my newborn baby and I had to skip next feeding because I didn't want my baby to drink something wrong.If you want to give it to your child,you'd be better taste or smell it before you hand it over.I feel terrible since I have 3 boxes(pack of 27*3, ordered too much...) left. If I can, I'd like to return it and buy another refrigerated soymilk."
5,Great Product - Soy Milk,"I switched to soy milk, trying an alternative to cow's milk. It had to grow on me, but I now love it. I like the individual 8.45 ounce boxes for easy transport and portion control."
3,"just fine, but my daughter didn't like it","The packaging is great and I'm sure the milk is just fine (I don't drink soy), but my daughter took one sip and didn't want anymore. I tried a few more times, but no sale. We lived in Korea and I guess she just prefers the taste of her soy milk from there. I'm trying to get her to drink ""regular"" milk more often anyways, but this was worth a shot."
2,"What to expect in ""God Drives a Flying Saucer""","""God Drives a Flying Saucer"" proposes that Christianity is the true religion, but that God is a nonsupernatural life form whose life span is so long because of high technology. The book makes the claim that God did create man and that Jesus was His Son and Messiah, but that His creation of us and the various miracles of the Bible and post-biblical times were achievements of scientific technology, at one point God is referred to as ""the master technologist."" It is also claimed in the book that while many flying saucers may be of other extraterrestrial origin, some are the transportion/operation centers of God and His angels.I expected this book to be a mixture of ""Chariots of the Gods?"" and ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"",but instead found much better logic and less game playing. I still don't think he's right, but R.L. Dione did use somewhat decent logic and came up with a presentable explanation."
4,"""Healthy tasting""","These bars are fairly good to be ""healthy,"" yet they lack the flavor and texture of many other granola or fruit breakfast bars. To me they taste like the equivalent of whole grain rice crispy treats (if there were such things) with added cranberries and some ginger. The combination of the cranberries and ginger do aid in the flavor, but the bars are ""stickier"" than I had expected. All things considered, though, they seem to be a healthy alternative to more caloric bars."
2,eh.,"Pretty Bland. If you are a fan of the series maybe you'll like it. I was looking for an action puzzle game and although it can be called one, it really doesn't move far from ""dig and dodge"" (lost interest almost immediately). Bust-A-Move is WAAAYYY better, Great single and multiplayer.Also, Besides having to navigate the silly story, ""Trauma Center: Under the Knife"" is great fun and has definite action puzzle roots. Try out those two instead."
3,Too Hard!,"I'm a puzzle master. Been playing puzzle games for 20 plus years. I rule in Tetris and this game is based on that style of fun. Puzzle games are the games I buy since I like the idea of being able to play for a few minutes at a time, if I want.This game has all the right ""connect the same items"" puzzle fun that I like but it soon gets way too hard. I tried and tried to beat the deeper puzzles but could not. You have to be so quick with your moves that Billy the Kid would be left in the dust.After realizing it was unbeatable, I sold the game on ebay.Get Meteos instead. Skip Polarium also, it's just not that fun."
3,"First book is good, second a little complicated","I read New Sun and then, after 10 years or so got original English edition of Long Sun.Book begins great and it really provokes some thinking. It is set up in some kinda sci-fi/medieval ambient and I loved first one.Second book/second half slows down and it happens in tunnels. I hate how underground became generic setting for this genre...Naturally, after this I took second half of series in my hands."
2,"Not the ""New Sun""","I purchased this book with great expectations, having seen good things about the LONG SUN books and my own experince with Mr. Wolfe's BOOK OF THE NEW SUN series.I was disappointed, I did not get the reading experience I was expecting. Perhaps I was expecting another NEW SUN. I thought the language and symbolism were presented well; however, I only read the first book in this 2 book omnibus and did not care enough about Patera Silk or his plight to read further. I did not hate the books, I just did not really ""get into them"" for lack of a better term. I really did WANT to like the books, but I found that I was pushing myself too hard to get through the first book of the omnibus to enjoy it enough to read further.I will probably give this another try in the future, simply because I enjoyed NEW SUN so much, hopefully I will be in the right frame of mind then."
4,Surprisingly good.....,"Like many others, I primarily purchased this CD for the Kings track (it took me years to find the name of it.......eat your heart out Weather Channel!). After listening to the entire CD a few times, I found it be pretty good. The drum programming makes a few of the tracks blend together, but all in all definitely a good buy!"
4,Admire The Scenic Splendor Of The Lovescape,"On ""Lovescape"", I really only care for ""Kings,"" ""Aphrodisiac,"" ""Sweet Whispers,"" & ""African Knights."" ""Aphrodisiac"" is the most intriguing track on the entire album. It gives the air of slow dance or a secluded dinner-for-two. Kings becomes a little repetitive, but it was the the track that introduced me to Toney's music. ""Sweet Whispers"" has a catchy melody like ""Aphrodisiac,"" but it's more mellow. And ""African Knights"" emphasizes beat and primal noises. All 'n all, these particular songs are solid. I can't really remember the other ones, but for ""Aphrodisiac"" alone, this album should be in your collection."
2,Let this one go,"I remember hearing this album when it first came out in 69 or so. It has one good song (as I remember, ""can you see her eyes"") but the rest of the album just plain sucks! Don't waste your time on it. I remember hearing this group in a club on Long Island and didn't think much at the time. The Illusion released another album called ""If it's so"" a year or two later which was an improvement but still not up to what other bands were doing at the time."
1,Trivia About This Band,Some real Trivia about this band that is intersting. I was at my first concert with my newest girlfriend seeing Mitch Ryder minus the Wheels back in 1967 at Indiana University. The Illusion was opening up for Mitch.They were just OK and dressed in the Hippy Looking clothes. I wait for what seemed an eternity and Mitch jumps on stage and who do i see? The guys in the Ilusion dressed in Satin Tuxs with their long hair slicked down. These guys were definetly not the Wheels. My first concert turned about to be really bad. Why Mitch thought these guys could back him up with his style of Music is beyond me. He might as well have me or the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band up there.
3,Good and decent boxed set I like it!,I ordered this box set last week and recieved it this week.I must say I already saw these films on VHS before and theyare much better on DVD in a boxed set. Great packaging Ilike how the survival kit was set up. There are also commentariesfor the movies and other features. I liked all 3 films with part2 being my favorite. I thought part 3 was a bit cheesy but not abad film just a bit corny at times.
4,Very Campy Horror,"The first Sleepaway Camp is fabulous. It is a pretty typical early 80's camp murder film, but with a few great twists. Some of the murders are pretty out there, but at least they are creative! The best part of this movie is the ending. Granted you pretty much know all along who the killer is, but the final scene of this movie is quite bizarre. All in all its campy horror at its best! 2 and 3 are downright funny! For anyone who appreciates the fact that comedy and horror, along with some bad acting, can go hand in hand, its well worth the measely [money]!"
3,Nice but overrated,The biggest plus of buying the boxed set is the box itself! It looks really cool in the shelf and the red ink that simulates blood is even sticky. The first movie is a good slasher with preteen actors (this means no nudity). the last 10 seconds of the movie will stick with you for a long time. Second and third parts SUCK!
4,Fun trashy slasher flicks,"If you take the trilogy for what it is, they are entertaining. They are of course trashy slasher flicks. If your looking for originality, genuine scares, and suspense then go watch Black Christmas and Halloween again. You get none of that with the Sleepaway Camp trilogy. What you get here are some great gore gags, lots of nice flesh, unique kills, and tongue-in-cheek performances. Sleepaway Camp 1 is takes itself a little more seriously than the sequels, but again, its not anything you haven't seen before."
5,box set is best to get all 3 movies,alot of video stores carried the vhs tapes of sleepaway camp vol 2 and 3.i have 3 places i rent my movies at.both volumes had been stold at each video store.the first and 2nd volume was the best.the 3rd one was gory.but seemed to unreal.i would recomened getting it.
5,YESSSSSSSS.........,LOVEEEEEE IT SO MUCH MY MOM LOST HER SET OF THE SLEEPAWAY CAMP SET SO I BOUGHT HER THIS SET. WE BOUGHT POP CORN AND GOODIES AN HAD A MOVIE DAY AN WATCHED ALL THE SLEEP AWAY CAMPS AND KILLER CLOWNS FROM OUTTER SPACE GREAT MOVIES WOULD BUY FROM YOU AGAIN
5,One of the best 80's slashers franchise ever,"I can't say enough good things about these three movies. Entertaining from beginning to end,lots of cheesy gore and a very pleasing body count. Including a gorgeous dvd transfer to three separate dvd's,booklet included. I have to warn you if you haven't viewed any of these films yet don't read the booklet it has many spoilers. Why buy the dvds separately when you can have them all in a stylish box set? A must have for any collecters shelf."
5,Classic box set,"This is a classic collection, she's up there with the big dogs of horror even though she is not superhuman but she's crazy and clever lol not to mention creative with her deaths but other than that, like i said Angela is one crazy girl they need to keep makin' em' lol if you like the rfriday the 13ths you would like this collection they're coming out with a new one i hope its gonna be good i like when pamela springsteen played as Angela but the return to sleepaway camp was played by the original which was alright but if you like camp horror films then you would enjoy these."
5,"Amazing Set, great Movies, Reasonable Price","I personally love all 3 of these movies especially parts 2 & 3 which have a great mix of gore and comedy.The original Sleepaway camp is great as well but is takes a more serious approach at the 80's style camp/stalker/slasher horror.Who ever said the ending is predictable is crazy, I can't see how you could ever predict an ending like that. I will personally never forget it.My only complaint is that this version is missing a DVD. The version I got comes with a 4th DVD with the never finished Sleepaway camp 4: The Survivor and the trailer.These movies are in no way Oscar material, but great movies to sit back with a beer an have fun.5 Stars all the way, you can't go wrong with this one."
4,GOOD RESOURCE FOR YOUNG READERS,"This modestly priced impeccably executed volume offers definitions in easy to understand language plus pronunciation guides, sample sentences, and over 1,000 fine illustrations.In addition, there are mini-features focusing on world leaders, history, and countries.An excellent book to help young ones become accustomed to using reference material"
1,"A yucky, greasy mess...","I bought this for my daughter who is three. She loves to finger paint, and I thought that this would minimize the mess. Wrong!!! It was just as bad, if not worse, since the colors don't show up--cleaning is no easy task. As other readers said, it's like painting with Vaseline. We had to SCRUB my daughter to get this stuff off, and wash and rewash her hair (she scratched with icky, greasy fingers). The kitchen table was a greasy mess, and the paint box was a greasy mess. The colors on paper were pretty, but after leaving them to dry out for a day, which they didn't, the counter was a greasy mess too.I'm very disappointed, as I do like Crayola's products, but this should be taken OFF of the market."
1,AWFUL,"What a mess! These paints are basically like vasoline. Greasy and very messy. Then, to make matters worse, my daughter made me some beautiful pictures to hang on the fridge, and after a day or two, everything bled together and the picture was pretty much gone. Not to mention it looked disgusting. The color wonder markers are okay, but the soft sticks are a joke too."
3,A big mess for a toddler.,"I believe this product is recommended for a starting age of 3 as a mess-free alternative to traditional paints, markers, crayons etc. I was tempted to try it for my 2 1/2 year old who prefers crafts to playing with toys. The finger paints are really greasy, so I had some concern about it getting on clothing and furniture. Although it doesn't mark some surfaces with color the greasy substance neccesitates clean-up. The colors do not appear quickly. My daughter didn't have the patience to wait and see what would happen after applying it. Because the colors don't appear instantly the impulse, even for an adult, is to apply more than is recommended which results in a big greasy mess. My daughter did enjoy smearing the ""paint"" on but doesn't understand how to use the product sparingly; she uses way too much. Lastly, you will probably not want to keep these works of art because the greasy colors saturate the paper and bleed together over time."
2,Not Recommended,"Although Crayola is a wonderful brand, I was not impressed with their Color Wonder fingerpaints. The time between when my children put it on the paper and the time it actually appears is too long for them, and they get frustrated. It is very hard to keep their attention long enough to make an entire picture. Also, it is not ""mess free."" The paints are very greasy and you end up cleaning it off of everything they touch (other than paper) anyways. I did not like how mushy the paint was...I am still finding globs of it everywhere!"
3,Great for traveling,"It's a great concept and kid's love watching the color magically appear however, I would highly recommend sticking with the markers for smaller kids (5 and under). The paints are messier and small kids tend to *dig* into the wax like substance rather than glide their finger across the top of it. It's wonderful for airplane or car travel because it eliminates the mess of color getting everywhere. I like the product but would still stick to the marker version."
2,Only good for older kids,"This stuff is greasy and hard to wipe off tables and fingers. It's good for older kids who can keep their fingers on the paper but not good for little ones who smush their fingers into the wax and get it all under their finger nails on the table, chairs and walls."
4,Warm & Toasty,"This is a very nice portable space heater. It is very safe to use and warms up a small room pretty quickly.Only negative thing is the 24-hr timer on the top right of the heater is complicated to use....other than that, it is a GREAT buy."
3,Ok for office desk...,"I bought this fan for underneathe my office desk in my cubicle at work. It is perfectly adequate, and most importantly for a work environment, very quiet. The only two issues I would have are (1) the complicated timer control that was not explained how to use it well in the instruction book, and (2) its use on carpet. It does shut off with just a bump because of the uneven surface. However, for around $30, it's a fine and safe purchase."
4,Heats up my office quickly!,This small heater is great to heat up my office quickly first thing in the morning. When it's on the floor (I keep it under my desk) it's very sensitive to being tilted downward and will shut off with the slightest nudge. This may be part of the safety tip-over feature but it's a bit too sensitive in my opinion.
3,Staying Warm,"My computer is set up in my sunroom where there is no heat,so the small heater has been a big help in keeping me warm.As a matter of fact,I have it on right now and it sure feels good."
3,Not bad.,"The foot switch does not turn the unit on and off, but rather controls the oscillating feature. There is no on-off switch, which is not unnusual in an electric heater, but would be a convenience. You can shut the heater down by turning the thermostat control, but it will start if the temperature drops into the 40's. The timer is of dubious value since you would have to leave the heater plugged in, with the implication that you would want the heater to start when you are not present. I wouldn't do it. In terms of heat, you basically get what you would expect from a unit this size (small); but the fan is nice and it is quiet. A handle of some kind would make moving the unit a lost easier. The small recessed area to grab onto doesn't work well. Safety shut off works very well."
4,Good Summary,I think this is a good movie overall. I just wish they would have spent more time on the texts used to translate the KJB versus modern translations.
1,sim,The History of the bible is nothing short of a miracle.But this movie does not capture the drama or explain the history well.I would prefer a straight documentary or an action film but it tries both unsuccessfully.
1,Does not communicate the love of God.,"I threw it in the garbage.Rather than communicating the love of God, the movie is sarcastic toward Catholics.The movie seems to have a hidden agenda to criticize the Catholic church.It is biased and does not acknowledge the Catholic Church for helping to preserve the scriptures throughout the centuries.By the way, I'm not Catholic and I was offended by the movie."
2,Not very good teaching tool,I bought this dvd to show students so they will learn about the history of the Bible but it is very boring. It could have been much more dramatic and interesting. It has information but presented in a very pedantic manner. It was a waste of money. Someone needs to make a more student-friendly dvd on the history of the Bible - one that has the information but in a dramatic and interesting way.
3,Where did the Christian Bible come from?,"I found this particularly interesting. Makes me wonder what the chances are, that whats in the bible has any bearing on actual happenings considering the first complitation of texts were put together over 300 years AD. It would be interesting to try and account for something that happened 300 years ago even today.I think history as recorded is only the one the historian wants to tell.(ie The US Military's approved media edition of the Iraq invasion...slightly different to the Vietnam edition) 2000 years of editing become a pretty serious game of 'whispers'It's worth the purchase price."
1,Don't buy this DVD...,"if you're looking for anything close to good scholarship or unbiased history. The man actually thinks that Moses wrote the first 5 books of the Bible--no respectable scholar believes that! Also, he does not disguise his disdain for the Roman Catholic church. I watched about 15 minutes and then threw the DVD in the trash--I didn't want to take it to GoodWill for fear someone else might see it."
5,Very informative,This documentary is very informative. I bought it for my wife and she is absolutely delighted with it.
4,carving for the beginner,Loved the book but wish he had included a list of good places to find and brands of tools that work best. Also wish he had included a western type dragon besides the oriental one. Good book even for beginners since he shows step by step how to carve all the included designs.
2,Two Dimensional,I was disapointed with the book when it arrived. Looked much better on line. I found the carvings and patterns very rough and two dimensional.
2,Poor battery life,"These lights look great, but they don't last the night, which means they're not great as night lights for kids. For my daughter this meant that she woke us up at about 3am when the room was pitch black again. Also, after I'd had them for a year, the battery life got even worse, one of them only lasts a few minutes and the other less than an hour. I'm currently on Amazon trying to find replacement batteries otherwise, they really are useless now."
2,Could it get any sicker?,"I have eagerly anticipated each of the Anna Pigeon books, but this one just sucks. It is way too evil. As in High Country, you get to a point where you are thinking ""just kill her and get it over with!"" I liked it when the books made me face some of my own fears such as claustrophobia and heights and fires, but when the fears involve people and sick one at that forget it. I actually can't even finish this book. Oh well, Dana Stabenow here I come!"
2,Hard Truth,Love Nevada Barr booksBut could not get past the extra disturbing topicsFound myself to upset to finishSome of the images I read I wish I could forgetBut I will not give up on Anna Pigeon in the futureThis one just took too many dark turns for me
3,Confusing and full of holes,"Nevada Barr has a way with words -- no doubt about that. But I'm not so sure that mysteries are her strength. The storyline in this book was compelling, but the number of plot holes and the confusion generated by the teeter-totter between points of views undercut the strength of the book. I lost the thread several times, and was constantly questioning Anna Pigeon's decisions (particularly the idea that once she captures the killer, she wouldn't just shoot him in the leg or lock him up instead of marching him out of the forest).The characters' actions served the author's needs, not the other way around."
1,Quite a disappointment,"I'm an avid fan of Nevada Barr. Always chomping at the bits for her newest book to be published. But this book was quite different than her others. Too many gruesome scenes. I enjoy her other style of writing. But certainly not this kind. I was disgusted with it--child abuse, a disgruntled paraplegic with a continual bad attitude? A battered kitten who is later bludgeoned to bits in her home? Nailing live mice to the wall to slowly die in pain? Sorry but reading this kind of material isn't exactly what I call an enjoyable leisure reading. I'm very disappointed in you Nevada.Perhaps the next one will be more like your old style of writing, with adventure and suspense in the great outdoors, not something along the mentality of the Texas chainsaw massacre."
2,very disappointing,"I used to look forward to the next Nevada Barr book, but no more. The ending was the most disappointing part of the book. However even with brief mystery about what had happened to the girls, a psychopath who tortured children, and a cult which did the same was no fun to read."
1,Where is the Nevada Barr I've known and enjoyed?,I started with Track of the Cat and read the entire series with joy--until this awful offering. What the heck happened to my favorite author?!? And I have been unhappy with every book since this one until I finally stopped reading her entirely. Each book has grown steadily darker. What changed her outlook so fundamentally? I don't recognize her anymore.
5,Beautiful Colorado,"The setting in beautiful Colorado is nice.Lots of scenery developed with the story.This book is real different from her othersin my opinion. The happenings are a bitdark, but the author is definately a goodwriter and knows how to put forth agood storyline within some beautifulareas."
2,Tedious,"Having recently discovered Nevada Barr's protagonist, Anna Pigeon, I have looked forward to each. ""Hard Truth"" was tremendously disappointing.Although I enjoyed the character of Heath and hope she reappears in a future work, I found the second half of the tale way, way, waaay too drawn out.I, like other reviewers, did find a greater portion of the violence gratuitous, and the whole captive scenario tedious, not suspenseful. I kept saying ""Oh, come on!"" and rolling my eyes.I can't remember ever skipping through an audio cd like this. Nor have I ever written a review, but this was so bad, I felt the need to express my disappointment.I didn't find the content necessarily offensive, but certainly poorly handled and presented.On a positive note, I really enjoyed the narration by Barbara Rosenblat - she truely brings Anna to life."
1,"awful, awful, awful","Before I got around to reading this book, I'd read quite a few of Nevada Barr's books and loved them. However, had this been the first book of hers that I read, I never would have read another. I am sure she is trying to make a point, but must she leave us with these awful images to haunt us. The book should come with a warning."
4,"not dark enough, or else way too dark","I agree that this was a darker book than her other Anna Pigeon mysteries. I liked that, mostly I found it gutsy.I have a few small complaints. Some of the plot elements came from previous books, and I don't find Paul nearly so interesting or well-drawn a character as Frederick ""the Fed"" Stanton.My biggest complaint ...SPOILERS... is that Barr didn't take the violence to its logical conclusion. If you think about the violence the villain perpetrates, the villain would have raped Anna. Now I can't bear to think of that happening to her, even if she is fictional. But either Barr should have had the guts to see the violence through to its conclusion, or changed the villain so as to make the ending plausible."
1,Hateful,"This is just an ugly, hateful, horrible book. Although I have regularly read the Anna Pigeon series, I have always found the gratuitous violence and brutality disturbing.This one, though, is the worst ever---I loathed the animal torture, the child molestation, the child abuse, and the extremely unsettling religious extremism. And, of course, Anna Pigeon HAS to be brutalized, as she is in EVERY ONE of the other books.This one was the last, however. No more for me."
2,Predictable and unpleasant,"I've read a few other Nevada Barr books and liked them well enough (although Ann Pigeon is far from my favorite mystery series protagonist), but this one I really didn't care for. I picked out the likely villain very early and I was waiting for an unexpected twist but it didn't come. Really there were virtuallly no surprises and those which there were didn't really matter much. I also got annoyed and very tired of her (the author, through mouth of the protagonist) harping on the one character's fatness, going on and on about it and describing him with really contemptuous language -- it gives a strong impression of someone who is rabidly ""sizist."" OK, the guy is fat - so are a lot of people, so get over it. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Too Much Fiction (2.5 stars),"Nevada Barr seems to be wrestling with the same dilemma that too many of her fellow series writers ~ creating a story that is challenging, interesting and believable. Like the cliff-hangers or yore, ""Hard Truth"" asks the reader to accept as probable, increasingly impossible scenarios. Filled with stereotypes, this was a disappointing read."
1,"The best description is ""bad""","Each book she writes gets worse and now itis time for the once entertaining writer writer to quit. I don't mind a little horror here and there but the whole thing needs to make some sense. Quite honestly, this is garbage. I tried the book and the audio but couldn't finish either. If Ms. Barr had been pedaling this as her first book, no one ever would have published it."
3,Rocky Mountain National Park?,"This book was a page turner but I probably wouldn't have read it if it had been written by another author. It was too dark, too connected with the awfulness in today's news for my normal taste in reading. For a story, it probably should be rated higher than a 3, but as an old Nevada Barr fan that is all I gave it. This author seems to have moved to a new direction in her writing, so her fans will either have to adjust or re-read her previous books.As in High Country, I learned very little about the National Park setting and the wonder of sitting alone in the wilderness was jarred a bit with this story of human fraility."
2,A disappointment,"Anna Pidgeon has been one of my favorite fictional characters since I discovered her in ""Liberty Falls"". I went back and read everything to that point and have enjoyed each book about her since then. I liked them all and felt special fondness for the ones about the parks that I have visited. So, I feel as if my bubble has been burst when I say if you feel like you absolutely have to read this one...wait for the paperback...on sale. I'd understand if Ms. Barr is tired of creating perils for Anna after all these years, but it would have been better to let her ride into the sunset after her marriage to Paul than to give us this truly disturbing piece of fiction. Perils, yes; complete psychosis, no. I'd like to think that as recompense Anna will get sent to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area where she and we can recover from all the trauma in the peaceful Zen of Marin County."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!!!,"I have read and purchased and enjoyed all the Nevada Barr books...until now. I loved all of her other mysteries and will probably try at least one more, but if the next one is anything like this one that'll be all for me. I have kept her previous books in order to enjoy them again. I gave ""Hard Truth"" away to someone who likes horror stories and stories with child abuse. Please Ms. Barr, come back to the light."
1,"Sorry to say, too dark for me","Unfortunately Nevada Barr seems to be going the way of a lot of popular authors, writing books that are not enjoyable to read. It's too bad, since I really enjoyed the other books in the series. This one had too much perversion and I skimmed most of the book. I hope she gets out of this dark mood and starts writing in the style of the earlier Anna Pigeon books. I liked the light mystery and descriptions of the Parks that made the books different and interesting. After reading this one I don't even want to visit the park it's set in."
2,Excruciatingly Bad Ending Ruined It.....,"I very much enjoyed this book in the beginning--nice character development and the plot was promising. I expected some disturbing twists in the story, but where it did end up going was so over the top and unbelievable that I was yawning rather than feeling terrified. The conclusion was gratuitously violent, gory, and fell flat. Who wants to read about a young girl who barks at the command of her psychotic tormentor?"
1,Unpleasant and gruesome,"After reading this book, I didn't read another Nevada Barr novel for years. Children being abused and tortured, animals being abused and tortured - it was horrid. Unless you are jaded or sadistic, you likely won't enjoy this book. My advice: Skip it and go on to the next in the series."
3,Not one of my favs,"I was a park ranger and worked at seashores. I love Anna! But, I agree that I found it difficult to get through..."
3,Not my favorite...,"but I love the series. The story does pick up in the last 100 pages or so, stick with it. If you are a fan you will probably enjoy the book."
3,Too creepy for me,"I thought High Country (the last Anna Pigeon novel) was pretty dark, but it was just dark in a ""nasty, brutish and short"" way. This one has the kind of psychologically creepy villain that I usually try to avoid. I enjoy mysteries generally, but I would classify this as a ""thriller"" more than an old-fashioned ""whodunit"". The book is well-written (part of my problem is I have no problem believing the antagonist could exist), and I was turning the pages to find out what happened next, but it took me several days to get over it afterwards.I liked the earlier books in this series better than the last couple, and am starting to think that if Nevada Barr doesn't lighten up a little, I'm going to have to look for something else to read."
5,Who stopped the presses ?,I'm so surprised this is out of print - it's a great book for rhyming and reading ! Bookstores say the get many requests for it - wonder how we can get another edition run.It's delightful.
5,How fun is this!!!,"Stop that ball is an hilarious story about a boy that is playing tether ball when all of the sudden, he knocks the ball off and follows it on an adventure all over town. The red ball gets into all kinds of silly trouble with the boy always one step behind. The ending with the little neighbor girl is classic. I have read this book to kids of all ages and we always have a great time. A fantastic story start to finish!!!"
5,A Treasure for Family Physicians and Educators,"The Fifteen Minute Hour focuses on challenges that family physicians actually experience in daily practice. Besides the well known BATHE techniques, there are sections on physician self care, anticipatory guidance, difficult patients, along with clear guidance on brief psychotherapy within the office visit. I often use the concept of the healthy self vs. the neurotic self in teaching. During stress the system goes on tilt and the neurotic self comes to the fore. One of the miracles I see in patients is the transformation within a visit bwtween those two selves as we participate in something that allows them to get in touch with their healthy self."
3,Great variety of patterns but...,"I hate buying a pig in a poke so I've included a couple Images above. The majority of color seems to be the orange of the cover. A couple of the previous reviews are over a decade old and, as this book is from 1997, I'm afraid it's lost some of its freshness. At least for me. The contents include: Texture, Stripes, Checks, Motifs and Pictorial. There are Resources, Credits, a Glossary, Index and Acknowledgments. While it is a fun book to cruise around in, there seems to be a disconnect between then and now. I think textiles fans and interior designers would find it welcome. But I can't see getting much use out of it."
1,not great,I tried just 2tabs for my puggle & it did not seem to do anything so I increased it to 4tabs. I don't see any change. I always have plenty of water for him. So I don't see it's worth the cost. Not happy.
1,Does not work,"Had my 75lb Female dog on this product for 4 weeks. It did not work. In fact, it seemed like the problem got worse, so I have stopped and have product left over.Would rate it 0 stars if I could do so.Try tomoto juice."
1,Nutri-Vet Green Grass Tablets,"Unfortunately, after 3 months of giving my dog the tablets, they didn't work. I was really disappointed. Also, I thought the tablets would be tasty. Apparently, they aren't as my pooch wouldn't eat them unless I put them in a peanut butter sandwich. Because of the stickiness, she wasn't able to spit them out.Looks like this product has worked for lots of consumers, but, not for me."
3,Almost works,"We've been using the tablets for a couple of months now on our 100lb mastiff puppy (male) because we noticed he was making some burn marks. We started with the recommended 10 per day for a few weeks and then reduced it to five. He loves these so much that we use them as treats so giving that many per day is no big deal. Our backyard is sectioned off into brand new sod, which is why we got these, and a weeded area for him to go. We figured we'd test the weeded area first before letting him on the sod. We've noticed the weeded area has burned out where he goes. Although it's not as severe as it was before the tablets, it's still not perfect. On another note, there have been no side effects taking the tablets, which was important to us as some other reviews noted that there were. I guess every dog is different. Until we notice significant improvement, we'll just keep him sectioned off and only let him roll around on the lush grass as a treat after he goes."
1,JUNK,Do not waste your money on these. My golden hates them and I had to hide them in cheese...after giving her 8 a day for 4 wks...still didnt make a difference in my yard. JUNK!!!!
4,Works Great,"I have a yellow lab that I have been using this product on for two summers now.Works GREAT! No more dead spots on the lawn. She thinks they are treats. Wouldfully recommend, no side effects that I have seen. Would not give to my dod if Ididn't think it was safe."
4,It works great if you follow directions (and re-seed),"Put your dogs on the tablets for two weeks. Then re-seed the yellow spots and be sure to keep watered. New grass grows in and doesn't turn yellow. No, it won't bring dead yellow grass back to life."
1,Can be harmful to your pet.,"Be very careful when using this product, it gave our pup a bladder infection and she started having accidents while laying down. Once we removed this from her diet she healed and has not had an accident since. So it could work for you, but it could also cause unnecessary harm to your pet. Look into preventative maintenance for your lawn before you put your pets health at risk like we did."
5,Great product,"Been using it with both dogs for years with no ill effect on dogs and lawn looks great. When other dogs come and pee on our lawn and we see te resultant burnt grass, we know we are not wasting our money. We are fresh out and I just saw that Amazon sells on Amazon Prime. Order up!!!"
4,Success!,"We started using this product seven months ago. Directions are very straight-forward. We have a 55lb. female black lab. At first we began giving her the pills as a ""treat"", but couldn't trick her for very long. She didn't like the taste, even when wrapped in cheese or peanut butter. Eventually we started adding the pills to her breakfast and she doesn't seem to notice or mind. This product works well."
4,green grass tabs for dogs,"My dog gobbles these up and we have no yellow spots on the grass. Would have preferred a larger size because I have to give her about 5-6/day -- she is about 50#. As usual, Amazon comes thru with shining stars -- free shipping and prompt delivery!"
2,Still burns after 10 months of use,"All, I purchased these as we have two dogs and I wanted to give it time to work (I""m on my third container. After feeding my dogs two of these each for the past 10 months, my neighbors side yard still has mutiple burns in it (our house was new so the dogs learned to use the neighbors green grass instead of our dirt and now that we had sod, they still run over there to relieve themselves and all you see if yellow burn marks). I'm going to switch over to dog rocks and see if that works. This product reduces the kill rate, but when they go in about the same spot, they still kill the grass with this product."
4,Helps with dead spots,"I have been giving them to my dogs for about 2 years now. They take about 2 weeks to start working and neutralizing the stomach acid but it does help. I have found out that if you miss one day though, you may end up with a few dead spots about 2 days later but you wont have to wait 2 more weeks for results, only a couple of more days. I just throw them in with their food and they gobble them up."
1,Green Grass Tablets don't work...,This product didn't work for either of my dogs. I gave the tablets as directed for over a month and there was not difference in the burn marks on my lawn. Easier to just give them a little tomato juice with their food each day. Don't waste your money....
4,"Ok, think it helps alot.","Used this on my dog, takes time to work and used tomato juice as well, all really seemed to help."
1,Waste of money!!!,We bought this product several months ago in hopes that it would prevent futher damage to our grass from our dogs urine. We would have been just as well off if we had shredded the $25.00 we spent and used it as fertilizer for the grass seed we plant. We have seen NO change and our grass is still being destroyed. We are moving onto the next attempt to stop the urine burns. Our lawn care guy has told us tomato juice in their food works. Don't waste your money on this crap!
2,My new green grass has yellow spots. This product did not work for either of my dogs. One 31 lbs. the other 38 lbs.,My new green grass has yellow spots. This product did not work for either of my dogs. One 31 lbs. the other 38 lbs.
4,Worked pretty well,"We saw improvement. It wasn't compeletely gone - but we lost far less grass. But, don't miss a ""Dose"" once you do - expect to see yellow spots. Wish it stayed in their systems longer - or we remembered better! LOL."
1,Didn't work,"I wonder why this works for some...but mostly doesn't work? followed the instructions exactly for over a month, with no change!"
4,No One Would Tell,No One Would Tell (True Stories Collection TV Movie)A good film. Who knew that adorable Fred Savage could act like this. A WELL done piece of work.
5,excellent,No complaints it was a great movie. I seen it before. Dude was crazy but there people out here just like him.
4,I lOVE CHEESY TV-MOVIES!,"I buy almost any tv-movie that is released on DVD. Most of them I have seen. Usually they star actors whose TV shows have been cancelled, like Candace Cameron (Full House). It's fun to see them in completely different types of roles than the goody-good characters they played on their TV shows. This one is about ending up with an abusive boyfriend who is so popular that no one believes he could do any wrong, and all the girls envy his girlfriend! The acting and dialog can be a bit over the top, which I love. However, if you don't really like teen dramas, move on cause although it's GOOD, it's not GREAT."
3,probably wont but through amazon anymore,"I have had no real luck with this one, it has been my third buy through amazon and this one skips, no CC, and sometime won't even play.."
1,Great guide but NOT in a pinch,"This book is a great tour of OSX and will provide you lots of background. BUT, it has no troubleshooting section. I bought this thinking it would be the only reference book I needed, and when my mac crashed and I needed it the most -- nada. Nothing on system crashes, boot problems, or any of the other issues that you might encounter in OSX. The previous ""Macintosh Bible"" books are quite complete, I have no idea why they dropped the troubleshooting section for this one. Caveat emptor!"
2,So and so,I didn't like it too much because my head is too small (asian) and the one size fits all does not have asians in consideration. Other than that I didn't think it looks all that great but if you are a die hard Redskin fan it'll work for you.
3,The Ninja - Part II,"This is the second book in Eric Van Lustbader's series that stars the Ninja Nicholas Linnear. It is well written and continues on where the first book left off. This thriller has everything, the CIA, the KGB, the technological world of modern Japan, and the mystical and dangerous realms of Ninja warriors.The sex is very explicit and is why I did not rate it has high as I normally would, 4 stars. But he does give you great insight into the Japanese business mind and their methodology in martial arts training. We also have a well-trained sorceress out to murder Ninja hero. Well worth reading."
3,Not as good as The Ninja but still a good read.,This was a pretty good book. At the very least you will learn quite a bit about Asian business and politics. Nicholas Linnear is so cool that I could have used some more butt-kickin' in this book. The ending was a little different than what I expected but was still good. If you loved The Ninja (which I did) then you should read this book just because of Linnear and the other characters.
3,Not bad,more of the same from lustbader. however it covers alot of post war japan business and some interesting fabels. it did lack just a little action for my taste. but if you like the ninja then you will enjoy this.
5,One of the best albums ever made,I have quite an extensive CD collection and this is one album that I don't leave home without. It's even better than their self-titled album. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to hear some great music. Rage puts all other rock/rap groups to shame. I was extremely upset to hear that Zack de la Rocha left the band. It was a sad day for the music world.
3,A good cd overall,"This is a fairly good cd overall. Two of the songs are absolutely addictive (Guerrila Radio and Calm Like a Bomb) and make the cd worth buying. The other songs are just a bunch of yelling about racism and stuff. If you are an established Rage fan, you should buy this, but if not, get Limp Bizkit"
5,Great Album,"This is not what you would expect from Rage Against The Machine. But, this is a great album and gets the deserving 5 stars award from me."
3,Average,It is an okay album not that great but i recommend it anyway.track 2 is really good.the others are all average
2,Previous efforts are far better,"This is by far my least favourite Rage Against The Machine album. The self-title one was really alive and full of energy. Evil Empire doesn't appear as good at first, although if you give it a chance it is as good. This, on the other hand, is of a much lower quality. There are some great riffs, the best including Maria, Born Of A Broken Man and Testify. Geurrilla Radio, Sleep Now in the Fire and Born As Ghosts are also pretty cool. The fact still remains however that they are going to need to write an album that is up to the standard of the other two if thier talent is going to be continued to be recognised. The only really good thing that I have to say about this album is that it does show progression, which is always good. However, if you are new to Rage then get the first album (called Rage Against the Machine) and then Evil Empire. Don't bother shelling out money on this one."
1,Give us something new!,"RATM sould spend less time on the politically correct bandwagon and more time on the creativity wagon. The first album was great; however, RATM should stop trying to mimic that album and give us something new."
1,rage against this album,"how can you rage against the machine, when you are part of the machine, as this band is? The music on this CD is good, while the lyrics seem to get weaker with each album. This is a radio band playing under the facade of being a rebellious ""against the establishment"" band."
5,Rage Changed My Life,"First let me start off by saying that I am not a big metal fan. and that rage is the only ""rock-rap"" group i listen to.Rage againt the machine is seriously the best band I have ever heard. And this Cd is awesome. The songs talk about things that we dont learn in 5th period social studies, or on channel 7 news. It forces you to think about things that are going on in the world, and even if only for about an hour makes you forget about your consumer driven lives.With the first five songs packed with enough tension and anger to blow the house up this cd is a must have for ANYONE. just dont think that rage against the machine is just another limp bizket or korn..."
2,Where Did the Music Go?,"I was very disappointed by this album. Rage's first album was the perfect musical combination of bone-crushing beats, agro vocals, thumpin' base lines and solid guitar licks. Although Morello's guitar in the Empire album was more innovative and added ""special effects,"" the overall feel of the album was true to its predecessor. In the Battle Album, however, Morello seems to think that the only thing he can do with his guitar is make annoying screeching sounds. The special effects don't leave any room for music. All in all, the album is a tiring hour of Zach's screaming and Morello's screeching. Where did the music go?"
2,OK,"Rage sorta has a beastie boys sound to em, loud and trashy, and I only got this cd for the song ""Guerrilla Radio"" which is da bomb! I didn't really think too much about the rest though."
3,THE WORST RELEASE FROM RATM,"THIS CD WASNT AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINES BUT IT'S ALRIGHT. EVIL EMPIRE IS THE BEST RAGE THAN THEIR SELF TITLED ALBUM IS THE SECOND BEST AND THIS IS THEIR WORST. THE BEST SONGS ON THIS ARE: TESTIFY, GUERILLA RADIO, CALM LIKE A BOMB, AND WAR WITHIN A BREATH. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR QUALITY RAGE BUY EVIL EMPIRE!"
2,Worst Rage EVER,"Was i ever so digusted in my entire life as when i put my BATTLE OF LA in my cd player? NO! This techno, softcore, sony-music label garbage left me only shaking my head and asking,""What Happened?"" Was this tecno hip-hop the band I had grown to love from its conception. Avoid buying or listening to this cd at all costs! (except calm like a bomb, probably the only good song on the cd)"
4,DONKEY KONG RADIO!,"YO, IT'S ASSASSIN FROM DEATHSQUAD AND IN A COUNTRY WHERE MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE IGNORANCES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DONKEY KONG, RATM COMES TO AWAKEN AND EXPAND THE MINDS OF YOUTHS WHO USUALLY WOULD LISTEN TO ""COWBOY"", WATCH ECW, AND PLAY NASCAR ON THEIR PLAYSTATIONS THAN DO SOMETHING WITH THEIR MINDS. FROM ""TESTIFY"" TO ""BORN AS GHOSTS"" RATM LITES THE FIRE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DECIEVED BY THE ILLUSIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT. I REALLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS ALBUM, AND WHEN YOU PLAY IT ON YOUR STEREO, INSTEAD OF BOBBIN YA HEAD, TAKE OUT SOME TIME TO LISTEN TO THE LYRICS OF ZACH DE LA ROCHA,YOU JUST MIGHT GAIN SOMETHING."
2,overrated,"why is tom morello so overrated? he does not have much talent in the musical field. this music is repetitive and boring. the reason i added a star was because the album has a good cover and nice t shirts.if yo want talent: morbid angel, soundgarden, emperor, steve vai, joe satriani, meshuggah, death, and carcass will do just fine"
5,Hay you listen up,"This music is pretty tight he is very talented,but here is the thing don't say the media is the right if you actually watched the news you would tell it is Kerry-Kerry-Kerry we love you lets make out.Kerry is so good.If you call this the right you are not the right.Now to the music Rage always does a good album.He has the right to criticize you don't"
4,Decent.,"Now this is just my opinion...but each Rage album has been just a shade under the previous. The self titled debut was outstanding, to say the least. Evil Empire, (the second album) was not quite as good as the first, but was still VERY listenable. After listening to Battle, however, I don't think it quite reaches the bar that the debut set. Not even as good as Evil Empire, really... But, as you can see by the four stars it's still awesome.And with all the Rage wanna-be bands coming out of the woodwork like roaches these days, it's GREAT to hear something fresh and new from the originals. They invented this stuff.If you're a true Rage fan you'll know this rocks when you hear it. If you're not..then Battle Of Los Angeles just sounds like more of the same, only not quite as good."
5,Blows away the first record,"I've read here that a lot of folks think that the first Rage record is the best. Are you kidding? These guys are just hitting their stride. As a new Rage fan, I can hardly listen to the first record now. I find myself wanting ""Maria,"" ""Guerilla Radio,"" or ""New Millenium Homes."" This is the best and probably most important band currently, and to listen to this record is just a thrill each time. I want to change the world after each listen. God bless you Morello and de la Rocha"
4,The Rage never stops...,"Though not nearly as superb as their 1992 debut, ""Battle of Los Angeles"" is still a compassionate dedication to the group's always flattering leftist mystique. Many have criticized RATM as being a propaganda band, but why complain when their message is overwhelmingly truthful? Tom Morello continues with excellent guitar work, a sound which at times can come in comparison of the skill of Hendrix. Although many of the songs on this album are not up to par with the latter, ""Guerrila Radio"" and ""Maria"" are sufficient enough to make the album keepable for serious, bona fide fans."
5,Perhaps Rage's best yet,"This is a politicaly inspired album that is a great blend of hip-hop and rock with the sound and fury that can only be rage. Zack's lyrics are just as good as the self titled and better than Evil Empire. Tom Morello's work on the guitar blows my mind on The Battle of Los Angeles just as much as the other two albums. My favorite songs are ""Testify"", ""Born of a Broken Man"", and ""Voice of the Voiceless"". It is good to see music and political activism back together. Rage is a band with a purpose in a time when fluffy pop is all over the radio and bands like Limp Bizkit are screaming about ""nookie"". Great album, go buy it."
5,"really well done, i liked it.","i bought this cd thinking i was gonna get a hardcore rage vibe, but what i got was a more energetic, less brutal version of rage, and i liked it. at first, i thought it was gonna be a lot of stuff like bull run, with some messages that you wouldnt like your kids listening to, but it turned out to be a ""cant stop us now"" kinda thing. i really like the tom morello solos, he can do anything on a guitar, he makes a harmonica, helicopter, turntable, just anything. he incredible."
5,RATM ROCKs,"I got ""Battle of Los Angeles"" the day it came out, and I loved it! My favorite songs on this album are ""Maria"" ""Voice of the Voiceless"" and the rest are also great. The only bad thing about this album is that it's only 45 minutes long, I can only wish that it was 75 minutes long, and I just can't understand why ""No Shelter"" isn't on this cd. But other than that, I think everone should get this cd NOW!"
5,Their best work,"In all of Rage's defiant individuality, they certainly never created a bad album, but even by lofty standards, Battle of Los Angeles is a watershed that surpasses all expectations. The drums and guitars that announce the album on ""Testify"" are as bold as any song they've made, but this time there's something else - the trace of a melody or two! A move to bold soundscapes and a snarky rhythm section is what really separates Battle and makes their protest something palatable - it didn't need to happen that way, but Rage loses none of its impact because of it."
5,Rage Against the Machine is the mightiest band in rock,I was first introduced to Rage when I saw Rage TV on MTV. I was awestruck by their talent and unique style. Since then I have bought their recent album Battle of Los Angeles and their second album Evil Empire. In a world of injustice and sensless violence there is finally a band trying to make a positive change in the world...through music and not bullets. I recommend Rage to anyone who loves great music
5,Review Within A Breath,"Wether you have heard them or not rage is one of the tightest bands out, their new cd ""Battle of Los Angeles"" is one of the best cd's I have purchased in a long time. Don't get me wrong the original ""Rage Against the Machine"" self titled cd is the king of all their releases but this i feel is definetly worth adding to your collection. Many tracks come to mind to remind you of the old cd but the best on the new one is ""Sleep Now in the Fire"" awesome lyrics and an amazing beat gives this song the ultimate feel."
3,THIS CD IS PRETTY GOOD BUT THE SONGS ARE KIND OF ANNOYING,"THIS CD IS PRETTY GOOD BUT ITS KIND OF ANNOYING I MEAN EVERY TIME I HEAR THIS CD IT GETS MORE AND MORE IRRITATING. I THINK IT HAS TOO DO WITH THE WAY TOO LOUD MUSIC OR THE LEADS SINGERS IRRITATING RAPPING, I ONLY RECOMMEND THIS CD TO THE LOUD ROCK FANS"
2,A true deviation from uniqueness,"This album falls short of expectations. It's clearly based on small modifications to the same guitar riff. How one could actually continue to sell albums this way is beyond me. Their first two albums rocked, but I'm sad to say I may even return this one."
1,the day the music died................,"this band sucks! this album is NOT a good investment all the songs are hypocritacryies. they claim they hate someone ""greedy"" yet they sold out and then they charge fans $61 just to see them in concert. who the one who's REALLY greedy here? rage that's who! this band was NEVER good and this album proves it. all the songs are showing what hypocrites this losers really are. also if you live in a black and white world and like to point fingers at everyone you ""think"" is ""wrong"" pick this trash up! the guitar work and drumming is the same in ALL the songs! a MUST avoid if you have OMG! ACTUALLY TASTE in music and you hate this group. i can't wait till they are on ""where are they now?"""
1,flat,they are a serious hit and miss group and this disc is no exception.when they are on it's alright but when they miss oh well.this disc for me suffers from sameness to much of a good thing isn't what i want again and again.
5,Why are people so stupid.,First off I have to say that I love this CD and I love RATM. What I dont love is how people have to go and (...) about how their political message is wrong and how they are lazy and really don't do a thing about what they say is wrong. Maybe they didn't notice that on the cd (or the ratm website) that all they money they make on tour is given to charities like Amnesty International among others. This is when I ask all the people who seem to have many politics but no views on them and say that RATM are lazy WHAT THE (...) DO YOU DO FOR WORLD? I doubt you give hundreds of thousands of dollars to charity. So stop pretending your important enough that anybody cares what you think. I just wish RATM had stayed together long enough to take a crack at George W.
2,Worst Rage Ever,"Was i ever so digusted in my entire life as when i put my BATTLE OF LOS ANGELES in my cd player? NO! The techno sounding, soft core, sony-music label garbage that was on this CD was awful and incredibly disapointing for anyone who has been with rage from the begining. Email me and I will gladly trade my cd for pretty much anything. teamyummyfood@hotmail.com"
4,"Third album, third on the list","RATM is very unique. They are one of the few bands that I am into that peaked with their debut album. Their self-titled was better than Evil Empire, Evil Empire was better than the Battle of L.A., and this album is better than Renegades. Their first album was a landmark album and was way ahead of its time. I guess when I think of the latter three albums, each sticks out in my mind for one killer song: ""Bulls on Parade"", ""Guerilla Radio"", and ""Renegades of Funk"". But with their first album, their was no clear best song. They all rock! Still worthy without a doubt though."
5,Rage Against the music business,"I am not big on bands using their music as a vehicle to voice their political views, but hey if the turn out music like RATM then GO 4 IT! ......this album rocks, it continues RATM's legacy as one of rocks premier bands, in what is now a dying genre (NSYNC, Hanson, etc.) If you liked either of the first two albums get this one now! It has great riffs, killer raps, hoppin' drums, and slammin' bass......and the songs are great too, here are the better tunes of the bunch......ROCK ON! ........ Testify,Guerrilla Radio, Calm Like A Bomb,Mic Check,Sleep Now In the Fire,Born Of A Broken Man"
5,Excellent - Best Album of the Year,"I have been a closet ""Rage"" fan for years. I've loved their other albums, but this one takes the cake. EVERY song is a good song. These guys never let up. Their energy is incredible. This album definitely catapaults them to superstardom."
5,"brilliant, maybe their best, which says a lot","RATM-band of the decade. This album definately has more funk then there first one and a little more then their second. I was impressed. I don't think that with modern day music taste, there will be many more hits then ""GUERRILLA RADIO"" but for previous rage fans, that probably won't even be their favorite song. All of these songs rock! Morello's a genius. Zach is Rage itself. RATM is my favorite band but my one problem is that Zach is pretty hard to understand when you're not reading the lyrics. That's not good for all of their politics-which I generally support. Limp BIzkit and Kid Rock are nothing compare to Rage."
5,GONNA BLOW AWAY THE EMPIRE!,"Rage Against The Machine's New Album, ""Battle of Los Angeles,"" is a very promising album. I have listened to it once or twice, and I can already say that a few songs are incredible. The first four are awesome. It took me a while to get into the first Rage cd's, so i don't expect this one to be any different. A new tune for the band that should keep them at the top. Excellent CD!"
4,Evil Empire Part Two,"On first listen I was struck by how much it sounded like Evil Empire with the exception of ""sleep now in the fire"". Tom Morello's guitar sounds are eccentric as ever and Brad Wilk's drumming is tight. I was expecting it to have a different sound from their previous album but it's still great. ""Maria"" is definetly my favorite song. Its lyrics paint a bitter picture but not a hopeless one. And like the previous two albums, all sounds are made from drums, bass, guitar and vocals. That's admirable considering most bands today sound nothing like their studio cuts when they play live. Rage sounds just as good live as they do in the studio."
5,Great stuff,"This CD is great. There's not a whole lot to say - buy this. Even if you're not a Rage fan, although I must say I'm a little saddened by how Rage has gotten more popular now and been lumped in with the likes of Limp Bizkit and Korn - they are far superior. I'm a long-time Rage fan, and this CD rocks. Everyone is superb, and Tom's guitar is spectacular as always - the chorus riff of ""Maria"" (album's best song) is pure genius."
4,Rage,"This new CD is pretty good. I especially like tracks 2,3, and 6. The cd is kind of a mix between their first and second cds. It's also nice to see a hard-core band nowadays with not alot of explicit lyrics"
3,been here before,"This was easily one of the most highly anticipated records of 99 but also, for me, the biggest dissapointment. I love Rage and greedily snapped up both ""The Battle of Los Angeles"" and ""Evil Empire"" on their release dates. Morello, the pioneering inventor of a movement that really hasn't started yet has lost the brilliance of 96's ""Evil Empire"". The distorted power chords are the same I might expect to hear on a third eye blind record. The politics are trite and wore out (Mumia, we've herad it before). ""Sleep Now in the Fire"" is Rage attempting to pull off a Jon Spencer Blues Explosion song, to little effect. However, this album does have some wonderful songs on it like the old meets new school rap of ""Mic Check"" and the feverent whir of ""Maria"" which seems almost out of place but would fit nicely into Evil Empire. Either way, if you are a fan of Rage you already own this album. If not, go buy ""Evil Empire"" and become a fan of Rage. Then buy this one."
5,THE BEST OF 1999,"This is primo stuff here people. I am a huge rage fan and this album just puts them higher than ever. Every album improves from the last..all are classics by the way. Every single song on this album, every minute is perfect. Its one of those albums that once you turn it on, you cannot skip songs. Every song has a new orignal flavor to it. Rage has not only one of the best live shows( saw them in philly '99), they have one of the best build bands around. Zack's vocals are faster and sharper than an blade. Tom morrello has to be if not the one of the best guitar players of this generation. He is unbelievable. Tim's bass just sets everything perfectly, and brad wilk plays the drums with fury and unbelievable power. I will definately recommend it."
3,OK Stuff from Rage,"It seems that the Rage albums progressively gets worse. The first album is by far the best one from RATM and is one of my favorite albums of all time. The second album (Evil Empire) is good but not as excellent as the first. After listening to Battle of Los Angeles, this is not better than their 2nd album. Its just too mediocre to be a RATM album. There are a few good songs such as Born of a Broken Man and Testify. This CD is still better than other stuff out there such as Limp Bizkit, Korn, Papa Roach, etc. so you should buy it and definitely give it a listen."
1,Oh Oh,"Here is the band that used to yell against corporate money industry, while taking corporate money and making living out of it. And the people actually bought it! Incredible! Britney can at least make your body movvv! Oh! Oh!"
5,Powerful mix of lyrics and music,"""The Battle of Los Angeles"" hits hard. It is a lyrical masterpiece(just like the first album) and Morello once again puts together a unique and wicked series of guitar trickery that blows my mind. This may just be Rage's best yet. They truly fuse hip-hop and rock together with the sound and fury that can only be Rage Against the Machine."
5,This CD Kiks A$$,This is one awsome cd. I can't believe it isnt the #1 selling cd on amazon right now. Every song rokz. Buy it and u wont regret it.
2,How the mighty have fallen,"THIS FOR ME WAS ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED RELEASES OF THE YEAR AND I ARRIVED EARLY AT MY LOCAL VIRGIN MEGASTORE ON DAY OF RELEASE TO BUY IT. I THEN RUSHED HOME, PUT THE CD IN MY PLAYER AND CRANKED UP THE VOLUME A FEW NOTCHES AND WAITED HOPING TO HEAR RAGE BACK TO THEIR VERY BEST. INSTEAD WHAT I GOT WAS QUITE FRANKLY POOR. RAGE SOUND LIKE A BAND DESPERATE TO RE-IGNITE THE SPARK OF GENIUS THAT WAS THEIR DEBUT ALBUM BUT HAS BEEN ABSENT FROM BOTH THIS EFFORT AND EVIL EMPIRE. I REALLY TRIED HARD TO LIKE IT BUT THE SONGS ARE SO FORMULAIC, NOT ONE OF THEM OFFERS ANY SUPRISES AND ANY MESSAGE DE LA ROCHA TRIES TO GET ACROSS IN HIS VOCALS IS LOST AMONGST THE STERILE DRUM BEATS AND THE TEDIOUS BASSLINES. RAGE ARE CAPABLE OF SOOO MUCH MORE THAN IS PRESENT HERE AND IF YOU WAN'T MY ADVICE (FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH), SAVE YOUR MONEY! LETS HOPE FOR BETTER THINGS IN 2000"
3,More like The Skirmish of Fort Lauderdale,"Had it not been for the strange covers release following, TBOLA would have been a good enough last release for this trailblazing group. It sounds like their most accessible, least antagonistic work, breaking down the uniquely aggressive rap-rock dynamic into almost an exact science, leaving a flabby midsection which negates that added spark of rawness which truly brilliant Rage tracks always teetered against. Even so, Morello and friends can do no worse then offer a perfectly solid release of standardized Rage mechanics."
3,ok,this cd has some good songs but it really isn't hard rock and rap like i expected it to be the only real rap and rock song is guerrila radio it has great lyrics and good background music but overall it isn't that bad its just not that addictive but if u like rap and rock that is not really that hard u should get this cd.
3,well....,"its okay,,imean the poetry is good,sleepin the fire in the fire is okay,,,,ilike the solo even though its simple. the riff at the beginning of born a broken man is good. the bit in the beginning of mic check is alright,um...i like the maria solo,kinda. Ashes in the fall is good, bcause the guitars are descending, just like name implies! but thats kinof where the record is lacking everywhere else. its not very well thought out,orintelligent, kind of a trippy thing.But i like the ashes song."
1,Gargantuan volume can't mask puerile rantings,"The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries. This recording is, most assuredly, one big misery. For a band that really understood the finer points of Marx, check out Gang of Four's ""Entertainment!"" ""The Battle of Los Angeles"" makes for great, angry listening among people who like to see the world in simple, black-and-white views and point fingers. It's also the ideal soundtrack for your next trip to North Korea. Meanwhile, in the former East Germany, stuff like this draws big laughs. One day soon Rage Against the Machine will learn that corporations--like those distributing this record--are benign entities compared to the wrath and bloodlust of state regimes. Turn it up, Pol Pot!"
2,ok...well I just don't get it,Well I don't get it...there's moments in the songs where you are meant to listen to the lyrics (which is difficult enough) then all of a sudden an explosion of sound occurs and a bunch of screaming...I don't get it....maybe it's just me I gave it 2 stars because if you can catch the lyrics they do have a meaning so you got to give them that! But I don't see the appeal...maybe next time
3,not as good as their last two,"Of course this album is good because it's RATM, but it just doesn't have what the first two do. I think Tom gets a little too fancy with his guitar, he should play some more conventional power grooves instead of those screechy solos all the time. The lyrics on some of the songs, like ""Mary"" are very good, and other songs are kinda lame. I mean, how many songs putting down the school system and ""the man"" do we need? Most of the tracks on this album have lame repetative choruses, and it makes all the songs sound very similar. I also noticed that they've really cut down on the explicit lyrics, which shouldn't be necessary anyway. The best song is ""Born of a Broken Man"" which beats ""Guerrilla Radio"" by far. It's the most like RATM songs of the past. Let me put it this way, if you are just getting into RATM, I suggest getting Evil Empire first."
5,Fantastic!,Excellent 3rd CD from the legendary group RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE. Best racks are: Guerrilla Radio and Sleep Now in the Fire.
3,"Nothing amazing, but interesting nonetheless.","I like this album, but very little on here is really amazing. Zach's vocals are fun, but usually somewhat incoherent and, at times, nonsensical (Then again, I hate rap with the exception of these guys). I like Brad's loose, groovy drumming. Tim's not much of a bassist, but he does the job well enough. Tom's guitar work is really the best part of this disc. The extra-harmonized flanger effects on ""Calm Like A Bomb"" are innovative and cool to listen to. A lot of his solos, while not terribly complicated musically, are still cool because of the effects he uses. Overall, the CD is cool, but will probably get a little dull."
5,Wonderful CD,"Amazing CD, great lyrics. Zach de la Rocha's voice is astounding, shouting out, in a form ""preaching"" as you could call it. Sure, you might not like how it sounds ,but it is about the message, first."
2,same old song,i prefer there last two discs better.but they are playing the same song over and over.don't get me wrong they put limp bizket and korn and those other wack mtv bands to shame.but this set lacks any progress.
5,This cd rocks,"I got this cd for my birthday, right after i got a few other cds, and this is the only one i listen to anymore! It was a great follow up to their last."
5,Simplicity....dynamics....mind boggling lyrics.....,"If you only buy one cd this year, i sincerely recomend this disk. The beautiful simplicity of instrumentation and the tightly knit lyrics combine to form an cd that will blow your mind some tracks to check out ""testify"" ""born of a broken man"" and ""ashes in the fall"""
4,rage rocks,I have only had this cd for about a week. One of my friends told me about them so I bought it. At first I was unimpressed; but the more I listened the better it got. Rage is now my most likly favorite band and would recomend this CD to any one.
5,"Strap your seatbelts, this is one hell of a battle!","In my opinion, this is their best to date! Intensity and message are both there, as well as creativity. Tom's sessions with Prodigy left their mark on the guitar sound, a lot of very ""techno""-like sounds."
4,not bad... for ratm,"a little ""kinder"" for Rage, if that's possible... some good licks but not quite as heavy/angry as previous offerings. same political message, of course. great CD, overall."
4,good but not great,This CD wasn't as great as i thought it would be. You'd probably be better off with their first self titled cd. The stand out tracks i thought were testify and sleep now in the fire. The others are just a big blur to me. enjoy.
1,same garbage as before and the guitarist is overrated,"Why is it that some folks are allowed to show their racism and others are not? These rage guys are race baiters and instigators their music is boring and I don't think much of them at all, if america is so bad then hey ladies .....leave ok ,I certainly do not care one way or the other, what's with the red star on your t-shirts are you marxist? or leninist? what's the story? come up with something new ok seems these dogs don't know how to learn a new trick, and stop supporting mexican terrorists ok ,, p.s you guy's suck, anti american garbage anyone who listens to this needs their values examined....."
1,rap metal ?,such an insulting band does not deserve to be heard... there is nothing: no music no tone; it just sounds like these rap bands against everything.
1,PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY!,I just gave the 1 star to get your attention. In a lot of the reviews i am reading I see people criticising RATM for their beliefs. In one review they are criticized for supporting the Zapatistas in Mexico. The Zapatistas are not terrorists they are simply a group of people who want what is rightfully theirs. If you're going to say something about one of the causes RATM supports do a little research first.P.S. the CD's great but not as good as the first one.
5,A very good buy!,"This album would have to there best album, up with self titled. It rules cos you love it the first time you listen to it, all the songs, not something you must 'adjust' to. Buy it."
2,The Same thing.,"They have a few good ones on this CD, but they all more or less sound the same. You will probably get bored of it after a while and not listen to it again. I would say don't buy it, but maybe get a single of guerrilla radio or something. That was the best song on it."
4,Great CD,"Let me start this by saying, as a general rule, I hate rap music. I like rock, metal, and others. I also don't like many of the rap/rock/metal groups out there (Limp Bizket in particular). RATM, however, is one of my favorite bands. Their instrumentations kick it and their lyrics actually mean something. Just turn on ""Testify"" and you'll get a sense of the energy RATM releases.buy this album"
4,Back to the Groove of the Debut,"This album overall is much better than Evil Empire, but there is still something that has fallen flat for me since their debut. They certainly have their own sound and are an amazing band for about 10 different reasons, but my interest in putting on one of their CD's has diminished over the last 8 years. This CD is a return to their debut for a few reasons, the biggest being that the band sounds like they are playing together as a band, instead of the tensions that were heard throughout Evil Empire."
5,"Well, I thought it would be good and it's AWESOME!","After Empire, I thought that maybe RATM had peaked in their originality. Then, when I picked this up, I was FLOORED. EVERY SINGLE song is something I can listen to over and over and over without tiring of it. It goes way beyond Evil EMpire and maybe even a few steps past Rage Against the Machine. They sum it up best with the line, ""All hell....can't stop us now!"""
2,Monotonous (2.5 stars),"Rage's fire was evidently dying when they released the Battle of Los Angeles. Instead of the undeniable power one would feel while listening to their first two albums has diminished, and Rage seemed no longer potent as a band than they did in 1993.There are a few good songs here, like ""Testify,"" ""Calm Like a Bomb,"" and ""Born of a Broken Man,"" but many of the songs sound like as if Rage was running out of ideas for riffs and songs, and de la Rocha's lyrics no longer were inspired by any new ideas, and most of them sound like rehashed lyrics from their 2 previous songs. I'd recommend their self titled album and Evil Empire over this one any day of the week."
1,The worst album in the stores to date.,This is the worst album i have ever heard in my entire lifetime
1,What is this?,"This is not music. Not now, not ever. When I hear whatever this is, I shed a tear and wish Lady Ella was still here."
1,garbage with good sound,"I have always liked Rage's music but their political views are too screwed up for me to be able to listen to them anymore. I was extremely embarrased to support this gang of commie losers by actually buying the album. Why can't they just get rid of the ""I hate America"" attitude and play music. If they don't like it, they can go live somewhere else. Let's see how they like it in say....South Africa!"
3,I still want more!,"We've been waiting years for a new RATM disc and we finally got it.. its really pretty good, but not their best... it leaves me still feeling unsatisifed, I havn't had my fill of new RATM yet. I'm already ready for another new album!"
3,"Decent, but not as innovative as their other material","First of all, even an average Rage album is better than most other junk out there. This album is very similar to Evil Empire, as far as song structure goes. They could almost be the same album. The difference is, Los Angeles doesn't have anything that is nearly as catchy as Bulls On Parade or Down Rodeo. A like the first album best because it is the funkiest of the 3 and definitely has the most bounce. Althought the lyrics are just as good as always, Zach's delivery is less impressive here than on previous albums. Still, it's one of the best albums of the year, if for no other reason than it has been a horrible year so far for new music."
3,"Solid CD, but not as good as Rage's previous albums","This cd is solid and has about 4 or 5 good songs on it. Rage sounds different on this album. They seem more fast paced and the drumming is less pronounced as in previous albums. The guitar is not as raspy, and the music does not seem as clear. This album has Rage's flavor but is somewhat different and, in my opinion, not a very high quality album."
2,Sighs all around,"Like every other Rage album, but weak. And weak is not something Rage should have been even for a moment. And Morello becomes less of a guitarist all the time."
3,forced effort.,"Being on the left of the political spectrum, i welcome rage both musically and politically. Unfortunatley, this album is an extreme disappointment. ""de la O""'s lyrics do not come through and aren't nearly as well crafted as on the previous two albums and Morrello's riffs are like hearing the same tune over and over and he struggles to come up with the rich masterpieces he produced on Evil Empire and their self-titled debut. This album is still worth listening to as some of the choruses came out alright but for the most part this album is dull and lifeless. The album is not a totally lost effort( i still gave it 3 stars), but when comparing it to the other two, it is a huge disappointment.In overall summary, this album is worth listening to, but it doesn't make you want to go out and start a revolution (a feeling i get quite often when listening to the first and second ones)."
4,Great Album,"I had forgotten how great the songs were on this album, after listening to it again this week i was reminded of that."
4,Another classic for $2.99,"One of a few i bought today for only three dollars, I'll keep buying if good albums are 2.99 often."
3,typical rage,"Typical Rage album to me, a few really great songs and a bunch of filler songs. The great songs are great and the mediocre songs are mediocre."
4,great music,"this was a wishlist item for one of my son-in-laws. It was a great choice, I love this kind of music."
4,Just plain wicked,"I am a huge Rage fan but none of there albums compare to the first debut album which is definetly one of my fave top 10 albums ever. Battle of Los Angeles isnt exactly what i expected but it definetly is worth buying if your a RATM fan. I found not enough guitar, and too much drums and needed less concentration on drums and more dope bass lines like in the first album, still none the less a rocking album. dope tracks would be, Testify, Guerilla Radio and Born of a Broken man. FOR SURE GET IT"
4,Lacks the furry and innovation of Evil Empire.,In 1992 this little LA based band took the world by storm spouting political agendas in a manifesto on cd. Four years later the vastly superior Evil Empire album was released shocking the world at the range of sounds RATM could produce. I think the new album more closely follows the first but is a fitting sequel to EE. Check out Maria for a glimpse at RAGE 4.
1,A very disturbing and degrading film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""Fat Girl"" known in France as ""À ma soeur!"" is the story of an obese 12 year old girl and her 15 year old sister. They are sharing a room at a resort while they and their mother are travelling. The elder sister meets a young Italian man and they have intimate relations with each other. [...]The film's depiction of underage sexuality, though simulated (The actresses were of legal age at the time of filming), is very explicit and I am surprised that it passed the censors. The film also contains a violent rape scene. I also think the film is degrading to overweight people as it can be though as portraying obese people as being homely.The special features on the DVD are two theatrical trailers, two interviews with the director, and a behind the scenes look at the film.This film is unworthy of Criterion Collection treatment."
1,"Loved Y tu mama tambien. Hated 'Fat Girl""","I saw this movie in a theater. There was a stunned silence after the violent, ridiculous ending. Not only did I think I should get my money (ticket price) back - I thought they should pay ME for my time.I love the intrigue and thoughtfullness of french movies, but this one stunk up the joint. (I know, elequent, huh?)Y Tu Mama Tambien is excellent (and more powerful on the second viewing). This ""Fat Girl"" is a waste of time."
5,This is the 35th review on amazon of this film,"Some of the reviewers of this film revile and detest it and would surely have a similar reaction to any other work by Catherine Breillat (were they duplicitous enough to watch anything else after what they have said about Fat Girl). Other reviewers extole this film and Mme Breillat's brilliance.No one is indifferent to Catherine Breillat and this is surely the highest praise. For those, like myself, who want to learn all they can during this life, then I recommend ""Sex Is Commedy"" as an appendix to this film. Thank you Mme Breillat."
5,Artistic Vision,"Two very different sisters live in an archetypal claptrap family/social structure where one responds to and the other flinches from what is expected. Although we are led to identify with the ""fat girl,"" she clings to alienation which could become sadly permanent. However a terrible maniacal surprise intruder crashes through everybody's lives like a bowling ball. No one is spared except the ""fat girl,"" who becomes a woman. A symbolic yet real ending which works only in this film and would ruin any other film."
3,"Abrasive, shocking","Although this film shows a very realistic portayal of sisterly relationships and offers a realistic (at times painful) view of teenage sexuality, the shockingly violent ending left me scratching my head. What was the message here?The ""fat girl"" Anais must endure constant emotional neglect and abuse from her family and others while having her sister flaunt her intense sexual relationship in her face. Not one of the characters was likeable. The parents were all but absent. This movie left me cold."
1,Anti-entertainment,"Anybody can shock. I can slit my wrists in the middle of the interstate, or piss on a cross. Shocking, but hardly artistic. I really wish she would stop making movies. She has the film-making skills of a clumsy chimpanzee and writes dialogue that is so other-worldly and removed from our own reality that it's like listening to a non-sensical foreign language. Please, please stop making movies. If you have a message, simply write it down on a piece of cardboard and, yes, stand in the middle of the interstate."
3,difficult to watch...,"This movie paints a vivid portrayal of sibling relationships. Although slow at times, the acting was superb and the plot kept me guessing. There is real suspense toward the end of the movie, and some scenes that are difficult to watch(sexual situations and extreme violence). This film is not for the faint of heart, but if you're looking for real drama and don't mind subtitles, you'll be able to learn something. I can't say that I left the theater thinking ""Great movie!"", but I DID think it was very powerful."
2,WTF,"This movie was good, interesting, until the end where it became very strange and made absolutely no sense. All I have to say is be prepared so say WTF, as I did."
2,Good until the end,"I guess to protect his identity the man killed the sister, mother? Or perhaps the girl Anais (Think thats how you spell it) Planned the murder? I don't even know. But I think the ending was completely lame and confusing. What happens afterwards? It leaves you with this cliff hanger that is never fixed and just leaves you with confusing Theories. If you're like me and constantly tries to figure out a puzzled ending, don't waste your time on this movie. It's not worth it."
4,first class!,very good! met every expectation. service was not only on time but earlier than expected. DVD was new even though advertised as used.
5,Great Thomas video!,This is a terrific movie and Ringo Starr does an excellent job of narrating these wonderful Thomas episodes.
3,Train Is Not The One Pictured,"It's a selection of Thomas videos, so if you know Thomas, you know what you're getting there. But as for the train included, it appears to be random. We received a red train we've never seen before with ours, which is obviously not the one pictured. Luckily it was bought as a gift for a neighbor who was just happy to get any train - our son would have been like ""who's this train?"""
2,Not Worth It,These storys are all on The Early Years. The Song is from Sing Along And Storys. The charcter gallery is from Hooray for Thomas. The web fun is from other movies. Really it is not worth the money. Buy The Early Years insted.
4,Came with yellow Duncan and Blue Thomas as pictured,"Though other reviewers say they got different trains than pictured, I received a yellow Duncan and blue Thomas as pictured. I ordered 3 Thomas DVD's with double trains, and one came with different trains than pictured though, so I think it may be somewhat random. It is still a great deal (it was on sale when I bought it) and the whole package cost less than a single wooden Thomas engine purchased at the usual price at the store. So, if you are looking to bulk up your child's train collection at a discount, this is not a bad way to do it. As for the video: running time 40 min, bonus freatures include ""bios of your favorite characters"", ""sing along songs"", ""link to official thomas web site"". Stories are ""james learns a lesson"" ""foolish freight cars"" ""a proud day for thomas"" ""thomas and the conductor"" ""thomas goes fishing"" ""terence the tractor"" and ""thomas and bertie's great race"""
4,Good DVD for little ones,"Loved this DVD especially since my son is getting into the whole ""Thomas Experience"". This DVD is slower paced and Ringo Starr's voice lulls the little one into paying attention. Bought it to be the last thing we watch before he goes to bed. Like that it focuses on lessons and action isn't so intense. Great for 2-3 year olds."
3,About This Disc,"The episodes on this DVD include:JAMES LEARNS A LESSONFOOLISH FREIGHT CARSA PROUD DAY FOR JAMESTHOMAS & THE CONDUCTORTHOMAS GOES FISHINGTERENCE THE TRACTORTHOMAS & BERTIE'S GREAT RACEStoryteller:Ringo StarrCome to think of it,I have the video for this episode and ""Thomas & Friends:The Early Years"",the DVD boz set too,but I won't be buying the DVD because I'm happy keeping the video. Besides,my Mom says I can't buy any more wooden trains,but she did say I can buy the DVDs until I'm 13 years old,unless my baby brother Jacob wants them."
4,DVD w/Double Trains,"Our son enjoyed this DVD. We purchased it because the picture showed two trains engines. When it arrived it had 1 train and also his tender box, but not two train engines."
4,James Learns A Lesson,"If I can remember this was my first thomas tape when I was three and I still watch it because it got me hoked. This is a great first time tape for little chidren. Watch James tackle a hill with some troublesome frieght cars, and Thomas get in to trouble. If you have a young kid, even if he hasn't seen Thomas yet buy him a Thomas tape. I myself am a good student and reader because I would read Thomas books and thats the first book I red."
1,Wrong trains included in the set.,"Instead of 2 engines pictured (Thomas and Duncan) the set ended up containing one cheaper engine (Mike) and its tender. A similar set I ordered last month on Amazon also included a wrong train. Finally, I paid $12 for this set last week and now the price has dropped down to $6."
4,reggae song,the track is called 'armagideon time' (justice tonight/kick it over being the dub version on black market clash) and i think it's by willie williams
3,No justice,"To answer the question of the person from The Netherlands. I think the Reggae song is ""Justice Tonight/Kick it Over."" It's a Dodd/Williams track, and as far as I can tell, is only available on CD on The Clash's ""Super Black Market Clash."""
3,veiwer in Pa,"This movie has some great music the song with lyric Super tonight is by The Clash ""Armagideon Time"" what version RZA used is the question"
3,Andrew Cyrille?,"About the missing ""jazzy"" song--I remember watching this movie and hearing Andrew Cyrille and Jimmie Lyons playing ""Nuba One."" I thought it was pretty surprising, considering the song is pretty far out for a Hollywood movie. The song is available on the ""Nuba"" album (first track), and you should be able to find a used copy here on Amazon. Too bad they didn't include it on the soundtrack--I thought it was a great part of the film and really set the tone. I hope this helps you in some way!"
4,Great Format and helpful to adult readers!,"Laubach reading skill books were the most comprehensive reading books I could find geared for adults. I have used all 1 - 4 levels and my readers understand the de-coding format, enjoy the stories and learn from the work pages. My only suggestion is that they could be updated in more modern subject matter."
3,Survey book with plenty of personal insights,I was excited to get a copy of this book and was surprised to see the breadth of the material. The effort to cover such a wide variety of important topics must have been extraordinary. The style is crisp and the outline flows well as the reader moves along. This is a good source book for those in the legal industry but not a scholarly work for the more initiated. Many good ideas of a practical nature can be gleaned from these pages. This is neither a review of the psychology of persuasion nor a consolidation of the ideas of psychologists and trial consultants who have works of their own. It appears to be the best thinking of Dr. Waites plus some general research materials which support his points of view. I congratulate the author and look forward to his other works.
2,I wouldn't trust my bass to this,"The Hamilton is the old standard that's been around since I was a kid. I had one, at one time, when I owned a cheap bass, and even then I didn't trust it. I trashed my Hamilton, bought an Ingles, which costs about the same but is much more stable, and finally discovered theHercules Stands Double Bass Stand. The Hercules cost about $70, but since you can't buy a decent double bass for less than $1500, is it worth trying to save $25 by buying a Hamilton? Get a Hercules, or better yet, a SharBass Stand/Stool($150), and you can relax. Your instrument deserves as much."
3,OK but ...,"OK, very portable, a bit too flexible for a big bass.But really not big or stong enough for a big 4/4 or 5 stinger bass."
1,Oxford Phrasebuilder Genie,"I recently ordered ""Oxford Phrasebuilder Genie"" version for single user from Amazon. After weeks of waiting, I was so disappointed as the CD, which I received from Amazon didn't work. In addition to that, I paid tax as the product was delivered to me in Canada. Even when I return the product to Amazon, I don't think that I can claim my tax money back. As a computer expert my self, I had no difficulty in installing the CD. In other words, the problem didn't come from my part. I went to the amazon website and discovered that some other people experienced the same problems."
2,CODE ALL WRONG,"This book just doesn't live up to half of my expectations. The author just says : do this, do that whithout a lot of explanation. Furthermore, the CODE is ALL WRONG in this book. I like the other 'STY in 21 days' books but I'm sorry I bought this one.Wrong Code : p. 63 : INSERT INTO mysql... should be INSERT INTO host (see figure 4.6) p. 64 : INSERT INTO user... 'Y') should be INSERT INTO USER... 'Y'); p. 64 : INSERT INTO db ... 'Y') should be INSERT INTO db ... 'Y'); p. 79 : Smoker CHAR(0) should be Smoker ENUM('Y','N') DEFAULT 'N' (see figure 6.2) p. 82 : USE DATABASE Temp; should be USE Temp; p. 84 : DROP tablename; should be DROP TABLE tablename; p. 85 : DROP Customers should be DROP TABLE Customers; ... And I'm only at Day 6 ..."
1,Typos galore! Don't waste your money.,"Typos galoreI know I'm throwing fuel on a bonfire, but this book [stinks]!HUNDREDS of errors and misinformation. I tried to return the book but found out if I open the CD it is non-returnable.The only reason I opened the CD was to get a file that WASN'T EVEN ON THE CD!Next time I will read the reviews on Amazon first."
2,Poorly written and full of errors,"This book is poorly written (I can't believe an editor even looked at it!) and full of sloppy errors. Even it this wasn't the case, it would not compare well with other more authoritative and accurate title's such as ""MySQL"" by Paul DuBois."
1,Very Poor Text,"I learned about enough to convince those unfamiliar with MySQL that I know what I'm doing - although I don't!The examples are full of mistakes. For example, on several occasions the author says he's about to do one thing, then does something totally different. If he gave better explanations of how the syntax works, instead of just telling you to do it, you may have better luck decyphering the errors. Since he doesn't, however, it leaves you on your own to figure out what exactly he's up to?Honestly, learning an entirely new language is hard enough without trying to locate and decypher the mistakes of an ""Expert"".Save your money."
2,This book is a joke,"I am new to mysql, needed something clear and informative instead they did a terrible job editing this book so now I am more confused about mysql than before. I absolutely do not recommend this book to anyone, there should be other decent books about mysql out there."
5,easy to understand,"This book doesnt waste time with all the little details and just talks about the major points. Want to be a MySQL guru? Then this books is NOT for you.However, if you are know how to code and how to use flat files then this book is for you and will teach you how to code your scripts with the use of MySQL database.Yes there are some typos like others pointed out but who uses the codes word for word from the book? You should know the basics of scripting language like Perl or PHP before buying this book. And you might want to buy a book about SQL.This book isn't here to teach you Perl, PHP or SQL so making small errors in those codes shouldn't affect your buying decision.This book teaches MySQL database nice and simply and I still use it as a referrence after 2 years of working with MySQL."
1,Out of Date,"This book is [junk]. The typos in the code, stuff that doesn't match the latest release all combine to make it worse than useless. Stick a sharp object in yer eye and you'll get more about using MySQL correctly than this book has."
2,This is the second worst PC related book i've ever read,"Two thirds of the book are about nothing. If the book was completed only on 100 or 150 pages (""the best of""), i could give 3 stars..It is a bit chaotic ordered, there are mistakes in that book and author often uses magic formulas ""If you need do this, do this: ..."". The book is much more about How, not Why.If you have some experiences with programming in any language, buying subj. is only wasting money.."
2,CONFUSING,"I thought that this book would teach me the basics of MySQL in a relatively short time. While I did learn some things, I spent most of my time figuring out how the author got from one step to the next. There were numerous typos in the code that left me, as a beginner, scratching my head. Most SAMS books are great, but not this one."
2,TYPOS!,"This book does a reasonable job of describing MySQL. However, it is so full of typos and outright errors that it is almost useless. If you buy this book to teach yourself MySQL, be sure to also buy lots of Advil!"
1,"200 Pages too long, I'm afraid.","I almost never review books because everyone gets bent out of shape when you say you didn't enjoy something that people seem to like, but this book begs for the exception, and mostly because the phrase ""yummy mummy"" is so loathesome that I'd like to demand it be stricken from the public lexxicon. Additionally, if you cut out the inane brand names, the unlikeable lead female characters and the aren't-we-preciousness of where they live, what you have left is a magazine article, which is really what this should be."
4,Another Bridget Jones,"Any book that makes me LOL can't be all bad. This actually reads as a suspense novel, the suspense being what they are going to do with the Americans who build an annex aka garage in the middle of a communal garden in posh London. In the style of Prada etc, this is a better written book. Every once and a while she repeats her cute expressions, and I wasn't keen on the adultery, but its definitely a brilliantly witty book."
2,eh... it was okay.,"I bought this book to read for fun. The first couple of chapters were good. The middle and ending of the book were slow moving and not as interesting as the beginning. I liked the two characters but after a while it got to be boring with just the two of them. I didn't like this book very much. Not as entertaining as I thought it would be, but that's just me."
3,the cd its just fine,"the box of the cd is broke, the cd its fine, but i think that it would be better. thank you"
2,Good only for his spanish speaking fans,"i believe this was ricky's third spanish album, and is about the same as the others, romantic ballads and radio friendly pop. i didn't like it."
5,great!,"muy buen disco. si eres fan de ricky martin tienes que comprar el cd ""aprendiendo a querer"" de jessica cristina, donde ricky grabo con jessica el tema ""todo es vida"". este tema es el primer duo de ricky en su carrera musical y fue grabado en 1992. 10 stars for ""a medio vivir"" by ricky martin."
5,A mesmerizing yet soothing selection of songs....,"My two personal favorites are ""Fuego de Noche,Nieve de Dia"" and ""A Medio Vivir"". The quality of his voice is wonderful. And of course, his version of ""Maria"" as well as ""Bombom de Azucar"" are very uplifting. My personal choice of CD to light the incense and just unwind...."
5,Listen ones...and you're addicted !!!,"A medio vivir, a medio sentir... From romantical songs to passionate latin-american sounds..how hot can it get ? As I've said, I'm addicted ! Special recommmandations : Maria, Nada es imposible, Como decirte adios. Ricky, you did it !"
2,SMC2804WBRP-G a bit better if you turn off the Timeout,"Unfortunately, the reviews below are spot on... I have the same complaint for the SMC2804WBRP-G -- the print server does not work well (I bought it for the print server). Per the recommendation below, I changed the Idle Time Out to 0 (in the SMC SYSTEM Password Settings page). Some improvement printing to my HP LaserJet, though inconsistent and it depends on the size/complexity of the file. The print server is VERY, VERY slow, hence the time out issue. The router will suddenly drop the internet connection sometimes when trying to print. Annoying. Customer service is quick to answer, helpful, though sometimes it is a challenge to effectively understand each other."
2,"case melted, does not work with multifunction printer","After about 2 years of use the case mysteriously melted, probably due to be beside the cable modem and baseboard hearing. SMC did not offer a replacement when contacted.As others have said the connection frequently dropsAnd the printer does not work for the HP Officejet K80 multifunction printer. There is no information on the packaging to say it does not work with MF printers.I will upgarde with to a Lynksys I think"
2,Same Printing Problems,"Strangely, printing seemed to work OK for me for a couple months. Then it died. Now, it prints about the top 2"" of any documents and then printing stops. Sometimes the router needs to be rebooted to regain Internet access, but sometimes not.I've tried upgrading firmware, to no avail -- even including some of the beta firmware versions floating around.Otherwise, seems to be an OK router. But don't count on this baby as a print server."
2,SMC2804WBRP-G a bummer,"I can confirm what the other reviewer has said here, that the SMC2804WBRP-G *WILL* lose connection on your wireless client with annoying frequency, and that the ONLY way to bring it back is either a Reboot from the Browser Configuration Screen (or by unplugging it for a few seconds).I had heard good things about SMC, but this product is simply not ready for primetime.Also, unlike the other Reviewer, I had a tech support person say the OPPOSITE of the above, in that they were blaming the client for this problem. (NOTE: A word of warning about tech support - it is outsourced to India, and you stand a 50/50 chance of not being understood, but instead have recited back rote ""answers"". Very unsatisfying."
3,"Great features, but unreliable--especially with Macs","I've had this unit for 8 months now (2/05). I bought it because it was a great price for 802.11g speed, plus the USB print server. Turns out you get what you pay for. I have Windows XP, Windows 2000 and Mac OSX laptops. The windows machines work fine all the time. The Mac laptop crashes the wireless network every day, despite a Summer, 2004 firmware upgrade (however, wired connections are fine?!!?). Never actually got around to using the print server because of the networking problems that tech support couldn't fix. Now I'm having problems with my corporate VPN. I've already spent too much time with this thing. I'm going back to Linksys."
2,"Great range, but don't use the printer port","It has an exceptional range in wi-fi! It supports both 802.11b and 802.11g. If you don't need the printer port, I say this is the BEST wirelss router yet on the market.I have Deskjet 932C. Everytime I tried to print, the router resets itself and never prints. I called the customer supports and they gave me their latest (or beta?) driver, but too bad that it still didn't work. (Oh, they have very good customer supports. Very minimal waiting time. that's another plus)Overall: if you don't need the printer port or if you have faith in SMC to come up with a working driver, this is a great buy!Since I wanted to use the printer port, and it gave me soo much trouble, I gave it a 2 star."
2,Avoid!,"I noticed my review was not uploaded to the Northern Tool site. This product is very poorly packaged for its given weight, size and overall quality (it is easily damaged). Mine arrived heavily damaged - twice. Also, the replacement was missing the drawer key. To be fair, for the price (especially now that they lowered it - used to be $200), it's not a bad deal, but I'd have zero confidence in it arriving in an undamaged condition."
5,Very nice design,This bucket cover is made of real tough material. It holds pretty much every thing. I like it better than my toolbox because you can see what you have. It carries so much stuff that it can be pretty heavy. I guess that is a good thing though.
3,Think this will make you organized?,"If you think this will make you organized think again. Sure it saves lifting a tool box lid but it will just be a collecting place for tools you hardly ever use. My cordless drill does not fit in it with battery and bit, heavy tools can screw up the balance and small things get lost on the bottom- but SOME of the pockets are useful, Better than a tool box for most stuff."
3,Light use,"I purchased this product for use at work, didn't work so well, made for lighter needs. My tools were to heavy and it wouldn't stay in place, but worked well with lighter tools. So I use it at home instead of work."
2,Breach of trust,"I used to buy nothing but Monster cables for musical equipment, even though the price after discounting (I'm one of the store's longest-standing customers) was not insubstantial. I became less interested in the brand when a piano patch cord shorted out on me, followed by the rubberized housing at both ends of this midi cable pulling loose from the plug, thereby exposing the thin wires underneath. Granted, not everyone is going to use the cable for jobbing, but of late I'm happy to play Hosannahs on my Hosa cables."
4,Mostly good,"These shoes are pretty much as good as everyone here has said they were. One problem, the inside part underneath you foot is a bit uneven in places and it makes you feel like you have something in your shoe that you need to shake out, or that your sock has bunched up under your foot. A lot of people probably wouldn't notice this but it drove me crazy until I replaced the inserts.[...]Their customer service is also not so good.Anyway, not the best shoe I've ever had, but overall probably a B+ or A- as far as shoes go."
1,Asics! Please change the future models!,"I never bought a pair of specialty running shoes until around 2002 when I was advised to buy a pair of asics 2070s by a specialty running store. That model felt great and jumpstarted my running hobby. Since then however, every model has become progressively more uncomfortable (with the last reasonable pair being the 2090). Now they have the 2120 which was uncomfortable for me with minimal exertion. They have tightened the midfoot dramatically. I was having tingling in my feet with these after 2 miles. Was able to find 2080s for dirt cheap online and did stock up but of course they are no longer available now. Asics! I'm pleading with you! change back to the old shoe shape or I'll be running in adidas from now on."
5,Best Pair of Running Shoes,"Absolutely love the Asics 2100 Series. Just recently upgraded from my Nike 180's to these Black 2120's. After owning Asics 2110's then a Nike 180's to currently 2120, I can assure Nike is all about marketing or the Air system is just not as superior as the gel system; and I'm a Nike lover. The rebound on these are just great and makes me wanna do another Marathon or ponder doing a Triathlon.I personally don't like the look of most running shoes, including the Asics, but these black 2120's look great, feel comfortable as hell, and I feel like walking or jogging in these.There was a recent story in the News about most running shoes/athletic shoes in different price ranges having no real relative impact on quality because of the technology that goes on behind making current shoes within $40/50 to $150 range. Bulls**t, these 2120's are far superior and worth the extra cost."
2,Go get The Past Through Tomorrow,"This collection consists mostly of the last stories in the Past Through Tomorrow. PTT may well be one of Heinein's masterworks, a collection of short stories that retells history from the late 1890's but puts the world on a different course. By lopping off the last few short stories, this collection looses the continuity that made the PTT a great read. . ."
1,Great Author and a so-so book,I did not like the book and was disapointed. Will be very careful in the future of the books I buy from this author.
4,2100 or 2001?,"I just had to buy a copy of ""Revolt in 2100"" when I read the back cover blurb:""In the year A.D. 2100 an evil Dictator rules the United States. He maintains power through the clever use of advanced science and psychology. And he is backed by a dedicated military clique...""Except for a little numerical dyslexia that's a perfect description."
2,I must have missed something...,"I couldn't put this book down...I just had to find the section where it finally got good enough to have been rated so highly by other readers. Unfortunately, I never found it. The plot was bland. The characters were dull. It was just a story. It wasn't good, it wasn't bad, but I surely would not recommend buying this book to anyone and I don't plan on buying any more from this author."
2,"Great stories, bad format","If you really want to enjoy these stories, buy 'The Past through Tomorrow', which collects most of Mr. Heinlein's connected short stories in one easy-to-read volume. I bought this book at a bookstore thinking it'd be some new stories (I really ought to have checked the back of the book!) This publisher leaves a lot to be desired in way of how they have handled and organized some of Mr. Heinlein's work.Again, buy 'The Past through Tomorrow'. It is a much more complete/definitive book than this half-done book (with a horrible cover, too!)"
4,hard as a rock,great !!!!product dose the job i will purchase again this file is hard as a rock.......just be delicate around the skin area
4,smmoth and coarse eac side.,"very good hubby uses them also got the pink too, he loves them and no more jagged edges on his nails"
4,A practical professional title,"Glancing through this book, I was impressed with the coverage of this professional volume. It begins with an introduction that discusses the need for revision generally and for revision in our writing education and addressing the challenges of teaching revision, pointing out that kids don't want to revise and haven't been taught the importance of it. The rest of the book is a practical guide to teaching writing with elementary and middle school age students. The book is chock full of ideas you can use in your classrooms, quotations from writers on writing, and examples of student work. Angelillo takes you through a year of writing instruction highlighting mentor authors, qualities of good writing, punctuation and grammar skills. The appendices include suggestions for administrators and coaches, becoming a teacher leader, and organizing study groups. This is a well written book that teachers won't want to miss."
5,A must see,"I do not typically watch these ""Chick Flick"" movies, but this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The chemistry between Perry and Hayek is outstanding. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to feel good."
5,Cute!,"The first time I saw this movie was at a friends house. I asked her if I could borrow it, brought it home and watched it again. The next day I went out and bought my own copy. While it isn't the most realistic movie ever made, it isn't meant to be taken too seriously. I recommend this movie for anyone- men or women. My 21 year old brother and his friends come into my room whenever I am watching it. This movie is definitely in my top ten."
5,Awesome,I absolutly loved it! It was so cute and whoever do the casting did an awesome job! I watch it over and over again.
3,Romantic movie,"So what if it's not a blockbuster? Perry looks good here, before his substance abuse problems, and of course Salma always looks good. I found their chemistry to be genuine. The scene where he's riding in the truck with her five brothers all glaring at him was hilarious. A sweet movie that's safe to watch with your mother..."
3,"PLEASANT ENOUGH, BUT NOT VERY FUNNY OR ROMANTIC!","I'm sure most folks who really like this film are just big fans of the two leads. I enjoyed this film to a degree, but I can't remember laughing once or getting that ""aw shucks"" feeling either(this isn't such a bad thing!). The best moments in this film come when Perry meets Hayeks family, but overall this romantic comedy isn't all that romantic or comedic! It's been done a millions times before and if you like these types of films, there is no reason for you to miss this one either."
3,Rush into love with Fools Rush In,Fools Rush in keeps me laughing throughout. You fall in love with the characters just about as fast as they fall in love with each other.
4,Critics?,"What are the critics thinking? That's what I would like to know. This was a great movie; no it wouldn't win any Oscars because of its simplicity, but sometimes the simpler things are the best. What a great story line for people with different cultures to view. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good, romantic, funny movie."
3,Eh,"One of my favorite movies but shipment took quite a bit, the case was broken when I finally received it and the DVD itself was a little scratched. This did not affect the playback though so that was a relief."
1,Crap movie,"Horrible movie.... the only thing that barely saves it is Salma Hayek, because shes gorgeous. Other than that, its junk."
4,"Good movie to see, good performances","This is a pretty good date movie to see. Although it is not the best movie of this genre, it's still very watchable. (Seems every romantic comedy since ""When Harry Met Sally"" gets compared to it, which is not fair at all.)Matthew Perry's character has a few subtle changes from his character of Chandler Bing on ""Friends,"" but you do notice the differences if you know Chandler's mannerisms well on the TV show. Salma Hayek's performance is what I liked best. She has the energy and the presence that we've seen from people like Rosie Perez and Marisa Tomei. But unlike Rosie Perez, she keeps the energy level at a good pace, rather than going overboard with it.It's an average plot, with several funny and unconventional moments, but it does tend to drag a bit in the middle. The ending and beginning are well done, though."
4,I'm buying it `cause I can't help but watching it,"There are very few movies I enjoy watching over and over and over, but this one is soooo sweet, loving, tender and funny that makes my day. It's light and refreshing, true and honest, and most of all very tender. I love it and I'm buying to keep watching it. Beautiful!"
3,Typical Hollywood Romance with a Mexican Twist,"Hmm, let me see. Post-yuppie Matthew Perry learns the meaning of love, life, and signs through exotically spiritual, border-crossing, unconcerned-with-making-money, pregnant Selma Hayek, and this makes for (dare I say it!) acceptable interracial romance. Sorry, folks, but the Mexicans here are still loud, Catholic, superstitious, and ominously protective of their women. My favorite scene is when Hayek's family takes over the Perry-Hayek home and redecorates it with bright colors and crosses (not to mention a suspiciously Taco-Bell like chihuahua). Still worth seeing, however, as an exercise in cultural anthropology."
5,Fun Movie,"This movie is so much fun to watch. Salma & Matthew work great together. I am so glad I purchased this movie through Amazon.com. All my movie purchases have been through Amazon, and I will continue to do so. Great service and products!!!"
4,The Big Greek Fat Wedding meets Sleepless in Seattle...,"Fools Rush In brings to the screen the love story between a yuppie WASP from New York City and a young Mexican woman from Las Vegas. Following an unexpected one-night stand the two go their own separate ways. As luck (or fate for that matter) would have it, the two are far from seeing the last of each other...Though not a masterpiece, it is a romantic comedy guaranteed to provide more than a just a few laughs.Matthew Perry, Salma Hayek, (both of whom are simply GORGEOUS!) and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are wonderful to say the least.The setting, the dialogues, and the humor are all good.Overall, Fools Rush In is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though you might want to stop short of adding it to your collection, it will surely put you in a good mood!"
4,"Where, oh where is the music?","No, this movie is no cerebral stumper, but who really cares? It's fun with great music, so just enjoy it for what it's worth. I've been searching all over for the music, but just cannot find it. Maybe the music-powers-that-be will see what we want and give it to us. Enjoy!"
1,TERRIBLE,"This is the single worst movie I have seen in a long, long while. Do not, I repeat, do not waste your money. I am so sorry that I ordered it from Amazon based on the favorable reviews on this page."
4,Very funny.,"If you like ""Friends"", I am pretty sure you will like this movie. It is funny and full of charms. Salma Hayek is hot. The DVD is OK with good picture quality. The Dolby 5.1 does not have much to offer as most of the movie is funny dialogue anyway. Get this DVD, definetely a keeper."
4,Very Sweet,"I don't normally go for ""chick flicks"", but Fools was romantic without being overly mushy. It is sure to endure as a classic romantic comedy.P.S. I LOVED the salsa and have been looking for the soundtrack forever!"
4,Good movie,This was a good romantic comedy. Matthew Perry is great and Salma Hayek is perfect as the girlfriend/wife. Together they keep you amused for the entire movie.
5,Perry and Hayek are a cute couple.,"And they have very down-to-earth, attractive personalities in this movie. There was plenty of humor and a light tone throughout. A great ""date"" movie."
5,Fools Rush In,"On the surface this looks like just another superficial formulatic Hollywood movie, and while that is true, Matthew Perry and Salma Hyek really make it work well. This movie rises above all expectations. When she finds herself pregnancy after a one-night stand, and they decide to be together despite the odds, they have so many issues to overcome. Perry is from New York and Hyek makes her home in Nevada. He is Presbyterian and she is Catholic. Not to mention the many cultural differences. They have terrific chemistry, and wonderful on screen presence together. Wonderful movie."
5,..Such a great romantic movie....,This is such a great movie to watch with your hubby or wife...at least I enjoy watching it with my husband..it's sweet and romantic..and FUNNY!!!..what could be better..
3,Stupid story at times but it's funny and the charactors hve chemestry,"I would not say tis is the best movie or great but it's good. The story is about a young American leaves Mexican photographer pregnant. She finds him a few months later just to let him know what happened. In the rush of the moment he follows her and they decide to get married. After that, a crash of customs and ideas develops in their families and in their relationship because of their different cultural and national backgrounds. At times the story is stupid and the acting is ok but there are funny moments. The thing that saves the movie is the chemistry between the two main charactors. Overall it's not a great movie but if your board and cant think of nothing to watch, watch this you'll be entertained."
3,MORE SUZANNE SNYDER,More Suzanne Snyder. One of the most excellent actress' of the 80's. I love her .
2,Sour and mope.,"If the role of the 'gringo' portrayed by Matthew Perry is typical of the U.S. male, apologizes to U.S. female. This young actor seems as ""Forest Gum"" in all his scenes. Even his mouth is open as a fool every time someone speaks to him. Nevertheless, Salma is fabulous as the Mexican girl. She acts naturally and with convincing dialogues. This could be better with another young actor; even a beginner could make a good role. This could be better with another young actor; even a beginner could make a good role. Some questions arrive. How a mature girl can be so immature (or immoral) to be pregnant with a guy she meets after hours. Is this the practice in Latin girls? Where are the anticonceptives? How does she protect from HIV, STD, and other diseases? This film is a bad example for the youngsters. I do not find it any positive in terms of culture clashes it pretends to portrait neither."
1,Fools make movie.,"Just another awful romantic comedy, that's all. This one's about a New York architect (Matthew Perry) who is temporarily stationed in Las Vegas in order to oversee the building of a nightclub. One night, he meets Salma Hayek on line for the restroom in a casino. They enjoy an assignation. She disappears, suddenly uncomfortable for no clear reason. But she suddenly turns up 3 months later, pregnant and pouting about it. They get married. Then they start fighting. . . . Does that about cover it? Perry and Hayek were both inexperienced as lead actors in major motion pictures at the time of this movie's release (1997). Unsurprisingly, it's Hayek -- you know, the one with more talent and ambition -- who comes off much better. Her natural charisma and ravishing beauty eclipses her co-star's entire presence. Oh, I sat through the whole film . . . but then, I'd sit through a 2-hour infomercial if Salma Hayek was in it. That's not a recommendation for a general audience, though."
3,silver dollars in the Hoover Dam?,"Beautiful smart Mexican girls seem to be a discovery tothis New Yorker. The south west has been dealing with themsince the 19th century.The culture clash here leads to some funny situationswhere the men in suits meet the Mexican maleface to face? People with complete Mexican heritageare still found everywhere in the south westwith close relatives in Mexico, but who alsospeak native south west English and have collegeeducations. ""Doctors, lawyers and Indian chiefs"" is the old phrasethat hold true here?Anyway the New York fellow finds out she is more womanthan he has ever found in an east coast educated girl.And she's having his baby...I enjoyed the movie and it gave me some laughswhen the two cultures both find they aredealing with their prejudices in an embarrassing way."
2,Not friendly to Bio-Med,"If you think vaccines may have any correlation to your child's autism or that autism is treatable via bio-med, don't pick up this book - you'll be sorely disappointed. It does give an overview of some therapies but it's not very thorough at all. ""Autism Spectrum Disorders"" by Chantal Siclile-Kira or ""Autism Spectrum Disorders,Understanding the Diagnosis & Getting Help"" by Mitzi Waltz are far better and more comprehensive."
5,As I wanted,Nice for the price. It fit as an original product. No problems till now. I have to write all this so I can hit Submit!
3,"Good book, but a better one is",The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook by Edmond Borne now in 4th edition. It has all that is in this one plus 10 other areas for mental and emotional healing. A ten star workbook... A MUST BUY.
5,Must have,This can be used with any client because everyone has trouble with negative self and moods talk at some point.
5,Thoughts & Feelings Taking control of Your Moods and Your Life,"This book has attracted the attention of my roomate, who has taken it for herself. Thanks for such a great book to help us regain our true selfs. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels their life is out of control, they themselves need to get back in touch with his/her self."
3,Thoughts and Feelings: Taking Control of Your Moods and Your Life,Good ideas but too hard for me to carry around a pad and write my random negative thoughts. I hate having to be forced to write 20 words when fewer words say enough. I hate being forced to be part of the social media. I think I will start an anti social media club.
2,"Some good chapters, but not that fantastic","I was expecting a little more with this book and so a little disappointed in the end. It has some good chapters like ""worry"" and suggests some helpful strategies but I was somehow expecting more. It is probably more designed for the naive reader rather than a psychological resource material. However, because it presents information in a very simplistic way it can have some use if you want your patients to read up on somethings."
2,Thud!,"All the ingredients are there....likable stars,a engaging script, and a compelling story. It all falls flat. The storyline, a man seeking redemption for an act he feels he committed, trying to mend the lives destroyed, and trying to find meaning in his own life. It also is the story of a young mother trying to keep a family together following her husband's death. Somehow, you get the feeling Affleck and Paltrow are sleepwalking through the whole thing(when you think of Afflecks's SNL spoof of the MTV show, Fanatic as a higher point then this movie, you know you're in trouble). Bright spots are David Galecki as Afflecks's post trauma assistant, very dry, very acerbic, and seeing Tony Goldwyn in a good guy role(although, I kept expecting him to do something evil). Very disconcerting, Jennifer Grey, post nose job, you know you know her from somewhere...... No Bounce, just a thud."
1,Chick Flick Hell,"Prepare yourself and sharpen the razor blades if your woman brings this home to watch with you one evening. This is a romantic comedy without romance or comedy. Ben Affleck is his usual shallow character we see time and time again. Gwyneth Paltrow does her best, but doesn't have much to work with. If you've read enough reviews, you know by now Ben visits and ends up courting a widow whose husband's death he is indirectly responsible for. After about an hour of this yawnfest you'll wish you had a night out with the boys instead of cuddling on the couch. The things us men have to endure for the sake of our women is tedious and sad, but this movie is brutal torture. When she brings this home, do anything you can to get out of the house or pour water on the DVD player."
2,This one is a skipper.,"As far as chick flicks go, this movie just doesn't measure up. The storyline is weak, and unbelievable. Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck have both been in better films. The feeling of the relationship just doesn't come across very well, and it didn't keep me very interested. If you want to see Gwyneth in a good chick flick, try Sliding Doors."
2,Is it over yet ... ?,"Although the family hyped this movie up, I was disappointed. The good news was that I was able to go to sleep as soon as it was over because it was quite unexciting. There were a few funny moments, but I got tired of watching Ben Affleck continue to look like a sleeze-ball. Sorry family ... maybe next time."
5,Good Love Story.,I saw this in theatres because it looked good and it was. I liked this Ben and Gwyneth did good the deleted scences were good and the gag reel (bloopers) so this is worth watching.
3,Have to agree...,"Ben is one of my favorite actors...but this film was not one of his best...but it was not terrible...I have to give him that! The plot was interesting, but very unbelievable to say the least!! I found Gwenyth's character to be just a down right bleep!! I have a problem with the fact that Buddy decides he is going to do whatever he can to find this poor widow, and tracks her down...STALKER!! Falls in love??? Please!! But I have to say that Ben's character (Buddy) poured his heart out to this ungreatful Abby!!Abby lies about her husband death...claims they got divorced...just cause it sounds better...and ""everyone is divorced"". BLAH!! Save it baby!! But when Buddy tells her something...the story changes!! I am not saying that this picture is a waste of time to watch...but just be aware that the script is not consistent. Good actors...with little to work on...have to agree with other reviews (for the most part)."
5,Great Movie,This is a great movie. this is one of the best romantic dramas i've seen in a long time. ben affleck and gwynth paltro's acting is great in this film. this movie is kinda sad and happy at the same time. this movie may be a chick flick but i found it very entertaining. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
5,AMAZING..................,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE I AM A HUGE FAN OF GWYNETH PALTROW AND BEN AFFLECK THIS MOVIE IS MUST HAVE.I WENT TO SEE IT WHEN IT WAS IN THEATERS I WANTED TO SEE ANOTHER MOVIE BUT IT WAS SOLD OUT SO I WENT TO SEE THIS INSTEAD AND THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT.I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERY FAN OF THESE TWO ACTORS.IT WAS GIVEN ""TWO THUMBS UP"" FOR A REASON."
3,"Charisma, that's what makes a star!","I am not a Gwyneth Paltrow fan. I never watch any of her movies except Seven where she only had a small role. So I always wondered why she's so famous. Bounce is the first movie I saw her in a starring role. I can't take my eyes off her. In it she showed real acting chops in portraying a mother, a widow, and a SoCal woman living in San Fernando Valley. Any wrong move can make her look/sound like a whiney and privileged Westside yuppy studio/ad agency executive or a jaded, cultured Manhattanite.Ben Afleck is also well casted in his role of a selfish and self-centered high achiever. I don't want to believe that he's like this in real life but he seems to be at his best being a spoiled and egotistic playboy. :)Charisma is hard to come by. Miss Paltrow has tons of charisma and intelligence and camera captures them and transcends them to the viewers."
3,Good On Screen Chemistry,"This movie is a definite chick flick but one that I believe girls will enjoy. If you are a fan of Gwyneth & Ben, they have some great on screen chemistry. The story revolves around Buddy coming into Abby's life after her husband dies in a plane crash. In a new genre of film for Ben Affleck I think he does a successful job of bringing some depth and substance to his character-he's kind of the jerk that you can't refrain from liking anyway. Gwyneth's acting is superb-you can see the pain and confusion her character feels throughout the movie. For fans of Ben, Gwen & chick flicks, you won't be disappointed."
1,Eeeeewwwww!!!,"I hated this movie, a crass manipulation piece that seems interested only in establishing Ben Affleck's range (see also: sniffling) as an actor.Totally devoid of nuance or subtlety (and swollen still by a spritely soundtrack that makes damn sure you know how to feel...on cue), I was too busy cringing to invest myself in its characters let alone its tired cliche of a story (see also ""Return to Me"").The true nadir: Gwyneth making poor Ben bid farewell to her cubs. And I'm supposed to empathize with a character who would use her own children as an instrument to inflict emotional pain on another (for ""lies"" that are never fully explained but are amply used to give her anger - gotta love that range - the right traction)? Puhlease. Ick."
2,This is not a good movie,"I wanted to cry about a dozen times throughout this movie! WHy? Cuz it wouldn't end!!!It's hard to believe this movie is written by the same guy who wrote the incredibly smart, funny ""THE OPPOSITE OF SEX"". ""BOUNCE"" has horrible dialogue, uninteresting characters, and a plot that is intruging for about ten minutes.This is an unbelievably bad movie for a talented guy like Don Roos. This is an embarassing follow-up to such a good movie like ""sex""."
3,unreal,"affleck and paltrow do their best, but the script is just plain lousy. Too much of it is so contrived, that I, at least, couldnt just forget about it. I kept asking: why would anyone do that? as a result the characters' dilemmas are unconvincing and the way they agonize over them seems silly."
4,Full of surprises,"I've read a few reviews of this film that said it was creepy and really not all that good. I disagree completely. I loved it. I thought it was a very good character study of 2 people in recovery from trauma, each from a different type. The performances were very good, the movie was not too long, it made its point and got on with it, and it was believable to me. There was one situation that seemed a bit off, but all in all I highly recommend this movie."
1,How did this get in theaters??,"Whoa,This movie left me with this weird feeling. I thought the plot was way too weak to even make a movie out of. Gwyneth and Ben tried , but this movie obviously wasn't worth the money put into it. The movie's plot was very un-interesting. I didn't like the ending. What were these two ACADAMY AWARD WINNERS thinking when they agreed to be in this movie. On top of it all this movie is Quite depressing."
1,"Good cast, BAD movie",I was appalled by how poor this movie was. I love both Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow and it's a shame that a movie with reasonable potential could be so bad. The characters are un-interesting and the plot is overly predictable to the point of annoying. This movie was a waste of a perfectly good 106 minutes of my evening.
3,"For heaven's sake, it wasn't THAT bad!","Actually, I thought it was a nice little movie. Formulaic, yes, but not painfully so. It's not Affleck's best, nor Paltrow's, but it's still a pleasure to watch them together. And it's a nice, quiet movie. No insane special effects, no murders, and not a lot of teeth-gnashing either (although there are more than a few tears). My kids woke up while I was watching it and I didn't feel I had to turn it off immediately--kind of a nice change from ""The Sopranos"" & such. I got two hours of Ben Affleck & Gwyneth Paltrow, 10 funny minutes of Johnny Galecki, and a happy ending. I wouldn't buy it, but for a rental, I'm not complaining."
3,Kinda slow........,"Ben Affleck plays an egotistical ad executive who has a hedonistic life style. When his plane is delayed, he comes on to a beautiful woman in a bar. They share a drink with a young writer who is anxious to return to his family. Affleck offers the young man his ticket so that he can spend the night with his new conquest. The plane crashes and Affleck is wracked with survivor guilt. He becomes an alcoholic and enters rehab. As part of his 12-step program, he decides to check on the writer's widow and her children. Predictably, they fall in love. From this point in the movie, everything is predictable and despite the glamor of the two stars, I didn't really care if they got together or not. This is a shallow film that just seems to miss the mark all the way around."
4,The Film is Standard Par,"What could have been an *excellent* film is pushed into the category of a reasonably decent one. The overall premise is largely untouched on in most films and does teach some good lessons in taking responsibility for your actions, dealing with grief, and moving on with your life. Paltrow is surprisingly good in a ""non-glamour"" role as a working mom, and Affleck is fairly convincing. The soundtrack is reasonably decent, most particularly Sixpense None the Richer's contribution.As far as family viewing, the film is on shakey ground. Strong profanity (including deity and one f-word) sour an otherwise enjoyable film, and a short scene with implied nudity gives the last tug on a short string. Suffice to say, I enjoyed it once but won't be taking my kids to see it."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I WENT TO SEE THIS MOVIE EXPECTING TO JUST FIND ANOTHER SAPPY LOVE STORY BUT THIS MOVIE WAS 100% WONDERFUL.BEN AND GWENETH WERE FABULOUS DEFINATELY A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE.SO CHECK IT OUT!
1,This is suppose to be a Christian author?,This is suppose to be a Christian author. The book had language and subject matter not appropriate . I was very disappointed.
2,Not an easy read,"I never worked with DNN before, so i needed a simple explanation on how to perform a basic installation and more importantly how to customize it so it matches my client design & functionality. I tried to read this book, especially the chapters about skinning and creating custom modules. I stopped reading early, because it was so badly written (yes, i write bad too, but you do not see me publish a book); no step for step explanations, no real world examples in the skinning chapter and most pages are just lists of API calls and other reference steps. I should have been warned by the introduction of mr. Walker: pages and pages of text about the history of DNN that screams for some professional editing: no headers, no pictures and the text could be reduced in half without any loss in information.To summarize: this is not a step by step explanation of professional customizing DNN, it's just a badly written reference manual. DNN deserves better."
2,not enough for anybody,"hard to read, not complete, messy but still something that brings you forward when you have no access to other resources.Still compared with what you can download for free from the DNN homepage (especially the training videos) this book is a waste of money and time for the novice as well as for the experienced professional."
2,Not worth the wait,"I recently discovered DotNetNuke as a solution to a set of problems. As far as DNN goes, it is outstanding. But this book, like so many Wrox books, is not very good. By the time I had finished the book, I had a good idea of what the team was thinking, but almost no resources on how to extend DNN. I would say that if you are serious about wanting to create modules and skins, and otherwise administer DNN, buy ""Building Websites with VB.Net and DonNetNuke 3.0"" by Daniel Egan. It's not that much better, but it is better. Also, the videos available on the DNN site are better than either of the books, and they are free."
2,Disappointed,If you are hoping to get help installing DotNetNike you will be disappointed in this book.
2,Where's the step-by-step?,Book advertises itself as 'step-by-step' but there are really NO step-by-step 'do it now' exercises. One doesn't get a sense of mastery of the material.not what I expected at all.
1,it sucks,the writers are cheating moneythey are just copying the documentations that come with DotNetNuke
5,Satisfies architect's needs,"I find what I need. I am a senior project manager / architect who uses the latest CAD every day.If you're new to CAD, buy David Frey's ""No experience required"", you'll learn with pleasure, fast, and more than most of your co-workers'll ever know. Otherwise, buy Finkelstein."
2,I found it a very tedious read,I have used Autocad and Autocad LT in the past and needed a refresher for the newer version of Autocad LT. This book makes you have to sift out Autocad from Autocad LT. I would much have preferred a two part book. One part dedicated to each. I hope you will find a college or junior college facility that has a good textbook for the Autocad series. I know people do not like to read negative reviews. I just want you to know I believe you can find a better book somewhere. By the way I gave up on Autocad Lt as the revised software has become very unfriendly compared to past versions which in my opinion were more user-friendly. I now do my architectural designs manually again. I have purchased TurboCad and will try to learn it.
4,Jason Rules,I bought these items for Halloween this past year and it turned out great. At first when I opened the package the hockey mask was super flimsy and durable. I guess I expected a hard mask made out of plastic. Yet the flexible one was very comfortable on my face. The machete is cool with the splattered blood. I sure scared and got some crazy looks from people this past Halloween in SF.
3,"Son is happy, me not so much","I purchased this for my son who wanted to be Jason for Halloween this year. Just getting around late on the review. At first, I was pleased with the purchase, very light weight, easy for him to put the mask on and light weight machete. But happiness didn't last long for me. Yes, the mask is big but to be expected, since it is made for an adult. My problem was the mask being made of a thin foam material that quickly lost its shape before we were done trick or treating. It still deserves a 3 star rating due to my son still wears it around and now it is December."
3,"Mask was less expensive elsewhere, too big for child",IT was just OK. Looked as described. I am an adult and it was too big for me. Coincidentally I was at Walgreens and saw the same thing for $10. The knife is OK and hard plastic so could be dangerous if an over-zealous child would play and might knock down something.It was just OK.
1,Definitely Not as Good a TOKYO CITY ATLAS,"See my review for TOKYO CITY ATLAS. It is much better than this albeit newer guide. The signage in Tokyo is still a mix of the ""old"" and the ""new"" system and TCA has better station area maps."
1,not worth it,It wasn't helpful. Those I got at Toyko subway stations were a lot more helpful and useful.
5,I love Makita,Excellent set of tools. I Love makita impact drill it is durable. i purchase this item about 3 years ago and i still have everything. Excellent set. A must have.
5,Contains some of the best short stories I have ever read.,"I read ""Midair"" standing up in the bookstore. This book contains some true classics in short story writing."
4,Great book,This book will boggle your mind. The words used to describe the situations in the short stories. There are more that many excellent stories in this book. I find it more enjoyable that a single novel. Advanced school programs use this as a learning experience. It is a 4 star book.
5,Book presentation,"One of the best from J. H. ChaseWHAT'S BETTER THAN MONEY ?, 1960SHE CAME OUT OF HIS PAST TO THREATEN HIS FUTURE...Out of Jefferson Halliday's past comes Rima Marshall. She's got nothing to lose : she's sunk just about as far as a woman can go. But she still knows enough to put Jefferson in the hot-seat. And he knows that she knows. With the deck stacked this way, blackmail becomes a deadly dangerous weapon to fool around with...see more at http://jameshadleychase.free.fr"
1,Who is Stupid Enough to Believe This?,"King David gay? Hahahahahaha! What a joke! Gays have made a business of co-opting historical figures for their cause--they say Lincoln was gay, Shakespeare...hell, pick someone, and odds are you'll find someone in the gay community who says he was gay--and now they're going after biblical figures. Unbelieveable.The relationship between David and Jonathan was not erotic, and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise. What they had was a covenant friendship, similar to a blood tie.If you want to know what the Bible really says, read reputable theologians, not these agenda-driven fringe lunatics."
1,kelsyus event chair,"This chair was very disappointing. It was uncomfortable--the support bars dig into your back, the seat is too high. In addition, the buckles on the armrests that hold the thing together when folded were broken within the first few days of use. Save money--order the lower beach chair model."
3,Chair is Small,"When I first saw this chair on Amazon, I was thrilled. It was very similar to a chair my boyfriend loved that was starting to wear out. When it arrived, I was disappointed as it was small. My young teenage son who is small for is age, has a hard time sitting in it."
3,Average But Effective,"This is exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered it. While my Colt LE69201 came with a user's manual, it didn't detail the field stripping and detail stripping process I would need to clean and/or modify my rifle. This book helps me to understand BOTH field and detail stripping of my AR-15. The images are crisp and show you what you need in detail, the book explains the process. But I find that the reassembly section feels rushed and leaves itself open to not explaining enough."
2,Small photocopied book,"Wasn't what I expected. Small book obviously a photo copy. Blurry pictures, not much information. Wouldn't recommend for the price."
3,Did it's purpose.,Book had a general overview of parts but drawings and pics helpful. With second manual made it work. OK for the price.
2,BENT,The content of this publication was basic but informative. The quality of the paper and the way it was stuffed in the box was very disappointing. The brochure was actually folded in half when I opened the box. Its evident the publisher is going to a Kinko's and having this made. Spend an extra ten cents and laminate the front and bag page to help with durability. I would not recommend.
1,"slow, s l o w, v e r y s l o w","For a digital camera that has been recently manufactured, this camera is unreasonably slow in its power up and response time. So slow, you might not even be able to capture scenic pictures before the sun goes down. Ok, I might be exaggerating a little, but not by much. This model is an embarrassment to Canon's otherwise nice line of cameras.If you like pressing the shutter button and then having the picture snap two seconds later, this is the camera for you."
5,absolutly great for first timers,"well this camera is fantastic , i absolutly love it , very easy to use , really compact , it fits and my smaller bag, it's reat if this is just first camera timers."
5,Very Pleased,"I was skeptical at first ordering online for a camera, but I've been delighted with it and had no problems with shipment or quality."
4,This unit cannot take underwater photos,"I just received this items yesterday and LOVE it! I was able to figure out the basics without reading the manual, which is great.I'm writing this review to clarify one point. Amazon states that this camera has a setting for underwater photos with an optional waterproof case. That is NOT true. The underwater feature is on the A540 only.I did not buy the camera for this feature, so it's no skin off my nose. But for others, it may be a big deal!"
2,Don't buy if you have kids,"I have a 10 month old and wanted an inexpensive camera that would hold me over until I could get an D-SLR camera. The lag when indoors between when the button is pressed and the time the picture is way way way too long. This is reduced outdoors, making it bearable. Unfortunately, my 10 month old isn't walking yet so we still spend quite a bit of time indoors. Also, time between pictures indoors is around 6 seconds, this is unacceptable."
5,Great little shooter!,This is my first digital camera and I really like it. Easy to use and excellent quality pictures. Took a lot of pix in dim light which turned out great and no red eye problem. It's small but not too small and love the grip part on the side. The AA alkalines run out quickly but I just bring extras with me. I would definitely recommend this camera.
4,A review from a non-camera-saavy student,"I bought this camera simply because it was a good deal, fit my budget, and received decent reviews on amazon. I've had it for a few weeks now and I'm pretty happy with it. It's really easy to understand and ESPECIALLY easy to get my pictures onto my computer. That what I wanted and that's what I got. The shots have all come out pretty well too.I don't want to say too much, considering I haven't owned or used it very long, but I sure cannot say anything bad about it."
5,Good choice,"Good points:Price, zooms, battery, easy use, quick reactions.Weak point:LCD could be bigger."
5,Wonderful.,"This is a great camera for users that are just interested in taking everyday photos. It has many features, yet is easy to use."
3,Wish I Had My Fuji Finepix Back,"Takes a beautiful picture. But, that being said it is definitely not user friendly. The instruction manuel is too complicated and every time you take any action you have to go to the menue button to try to figure out what to do. There is nothing simple about this camera. Also, the LCD eats the batteries up in a hurry."
5,Excellent!,"This little camera takes beautiful photos! My only complaint, and a minor one at that, is that it eats batteries."
3,Canon PowerShot Shutter,"For the most part I like my new Canon Powershot A530, except, the lens cover (works sort of like a shutter in front of the lens) sticks when you turn the camera on. I've ruined several shots since it started doing this. When you first turn on the camera you have to remember to finish popping it open with your fingernail.... Any suggestions?"
2,"Ok, but not great","This is a great camera for outdoor shots, or very well-lit indoor shots, but if the flash is used indoors for any reason, it makes the picture look like we live in a dark cave - very fake lighting.My other problem is that it eats through batteries like there's no tomorrow. About every 10 pictures or 1 video its demanding fresh batteries and it takes alot longer to get to where it can take a picture. Not great when I want to capture scrapbook-able moments with my 3 young'uns. I'm missing alot. In the grand scheme of things, I really dislike this camera. It has too many features I'll never use because I'm too busy being frustrated with the features I DO use."
5,Great affordable camera,"This is a great starter camera for anyone. Canon is a great user friendly camera. You can take this camera further if you wish, or you can aim and shoot."
4,great value for the price,"This camera takes excellent pictures and is very simple to use. I also love the video feature and the viewfinder--neither of which are standard on a lot of cameras in this price range. The software is user friendly as well. My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be an editing feature that allows you to edit the pictures before you upload them. Other than that, I would very highly recommend this camera to anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a digital camera but does want to have decent quality photos."
4,Very good,"I love the camera, however it seems to be a bit on the fragile side, based on the fact that it has a lens error and I never dropped it or had considerable damage done to it. It is currently on its way back to the manufactor to get repaired.However I love the options, and it's fairly easy to operate. I was also slightly dissapointed that there are no waterproof cases available for my model. Maybe in the future?Overall, I enjoy my digital camera very much. Thanks!"
4,Canon Powershot A530 Digital Camera,"This model (the A530) has been replaced now with the A590 which retails for about $150. I've bought a couple of A 530's over the past couple of years(one for each daughter). The A530 is only 5 megapixtels, but it takes great pictures. It has proven to be very durable."
2,"A530 - Too slow, dont buy it.","Takes great pictures outside. In doors though the camera takes 2 or more minutes to come on and get ready for a shot.I have sent Cannon support questions regarding this and browsed cannon forums.No help was offered.Even with the camera on, I was never able to get a candid shot of my kids, its just too darn slow. Also carry extra batteries if you go some where."
5,Great Camera,"I love this camera. It has enough features for a camera hobbyist and is simple enough for an amateur. The manual provided with the camera is very detailed and easy to understand. One of the things I don't like about it is the shutter lag time (especially bad when batteries are low). I like to take pictures of my niece and the camera isn't fast enough sometimes to capture some special moments. The only other thing I would change would be for the zoom to be 6x, but still a great camera. I bought it on Black Friday so the price was much better too:). I would definitely buy this camera again. I have some great pictures because of it."
3,Easy-peasy,"I have been reading great reviews of the Canon Powershot for several years, and having taken a bunch of high-rez pictures on a Sharp, was ready for an upgrade.Welllll... the camera is easy to use, light, simple to operate... but the pictures aren't the excellent quality I have come to expect from Canon. Good, but not great.Service was okay, a bit slow to ship and advertised the product as new (it was not), but when they didn't have the smaller storage chip we ordered, they substituted a 1Gig which went a long way toward consoling us.Again, good, maybe even very good, but not great."
4,Nice camera for the money,Nice camera for the money and easy to use. One downer is the AA battery's. Even with rechargables in seems we're always changing them.
1,Beware the dreaded e18 error that renders your camera useless,"Google ""Canon"" and ""e18"" before you buy this camera! They have a mnajor flaw in the lens mechanism of all their cameras."
4,good enough,"based on previous reviews i bought this camera as it was inexpensive compared to other canon cameras and i needed to buy a camera for my 15 year old son. this camera has v. good features as all other canon cameras have though i dont particularly like its look. However it is easy to hold the camera to shoot pictures without shaking, and the digital display is good enough i guess for a first time camera for my son. I would definitely go in for a better camera (thin and sleek one, though it would be more expensive) when i buy a camera again."
5,Canon Powershot,"Camera is everything and more than I expected. It has more capabilities than I will probably use. The basic photography is simple and captures excellent images. Compared to previous digital cameras I have used, the batteries last much longer than I expected."
4,Canon Power Shot A530 5MP Digital Camera,"Easy to use, including zoom and uploading to computer. Nice clear photos when printed out."
5,Quality and Simplicity,"This camera takes high definition shots that look great . The zoom is good enough to get detailed shots of alligators in the water or birds in trees.It is simple to us and so compact and light that I can take it with me every day. This was very useful when I was on vacation recently in South Carolina.I also bought the rechargable battery pack as it goes through a lot of power, a 1gb memory card and a cary case.It's good to get these at the same time."
2,Disappointed,"From reading the other reviews, I seem to be one of the few to have mechanical issues with my A530. Within a month after buying it, the lens cover began remaining half closed when the power is turned on. I have to manually flick open the shutter/cover. Then, the flash began intermittently malfunctioning and now the zoom function will only work in one direction (that is, it works to ""zoom in"" on something, to zoom back out I have to turn the camera off and back on. To my knowledge, the camera has not been dropped or otherwise physically abused to cause these problems.I'm disappointed because I do like the photos that the camera takes when it does function properly.Fortunately, I bought it at Costco, so it's going back."
2,Bacon,This camera took fantastic pics but the batts would die instantly-I'd put in new batts and it would tell me to change the batteries right away. This happened more than once. The size with the handle is a little too large. I was unable to fit it into my small purse.I returned it within 2 wks.
2,disappointing,"Im a professional photographer who was looking for a point and shoot for my wife. She was previously using the 2mp powershot A60 which was AWESOME but had been dropped on its head one too many times in the 3 years she had it. This was NOT a good replacement. Noisy noisy images, slow to write to the card. I could go on, but overall, just not a good camera."
1,Waste of time and money,"I got this camera back in May and lost it (but this camera seemed to be the best). I ordered the same camera from Amazon but had to return it because one of the pixels were blown. I got my replacement but the amount of time it takes to take a picture is an eternity.Look for some other camera. If people are posing you better hope you get it on the 1st shot, because if you don't it takes too long to take another."
4,Loved this camera.,"I loved this camera and has upgraded to a 10 megapixels ever since. This camera was light, compact and reliable with the software and energy efficient on the disposable batteries. I miss the a/v video connectors this model had, but I got the benefit of rechargeable battery on the new model that now I own. this camera is still good for an amateur photographer and you will find the used at a reasonable price nowadays."
5,Canon Power Shot A530,I am very happy with this purchase. The camera operates just as it should. The price was right. I wanted a small camera with a view finder. It is not possible to find any new ones with view finders.
3,A530 lens problems,"I have had the camera about 4 months.It is now in for repair for the second time with the e18 error.This error stops the lens from going in and out correctly.When the camera works it works fine and is easy to use, but for me the camera has been in 1/3 of the time I owned it.I had a A520 before updating and it also broke.I have had cameras for years and never had a repair until these 2.I am very nervous about the powershot series now."
5,Great First Digital Camera,I purchased this camera for myself as a Christmas gift. I love it. It was cheap (although I did buy it from Ritz Camera) and takes excellent pictures. It is very easy to use even without the manual. I would recommend this to anyone looking for their first digital camera.
2,I am a beginner...but this camera is in a lower level,"I bought this camera mainly because of its fair reviews on the internet. Customer ratings were around 4 stars, so i thought it was very smart to buy this camera and become my first digital one.What i found?- The pictures are slightly darker than its competitors with the same specification.- Usually marks you are shaken to take the picture- In other ocassion you are not notify about the shaken status and even though the photos are blurred.- Size is ok- You have to wait about 6 or 7 seconds to take your next picture (too much time!)- The outside photos are the better ones, but the one taken inside are too dark for my expectations.I definetly think you may invest 40 or 50 extra bucks and get something better. As i will do right now."
1,Probably a defective piece,"Strangely enough, our experience with this product is quite the opposite of what most of the reviews are claiming.During my holiday trip, I forgot to pack my camera and was forced to buy this one as a temporary replacement. From the very first photo, I started having horrible experience. The night scene mode capptures extremely grainy images - nowhere close to what's expected of a 5 MP camera. Each picture takes 30 seconds or more to be saved - so you really cannot take more than 2 pictures per minute. Yes - not 2 pics per second - but 2 pics per minute. That is unacceptable by any standards - right? In addition, it has a terrible time focusing while taking nightshots.I am increasingly finding it difficult to accept that Cannon would manufacture such a low grade camera. May be I was unlucky to pick up a defective piece - and I sure am going to return it soon."
2,Battery failure,"This camera, in use since October, burns batteries at an incredible rate. After twenty shots, the batteries die. I have requested from Canon an explanation, they tell me to send it back for repairs. A big dissapointment"
2,"Problematic, poor performance over time","I've had this camera for 1.5 years. I purchased it originally as an upgrade from an Olympus. I've had nothing but problems with it and have sent it in for repair, only to have the same problem occur after they fixed it and the warranty expired. It's sensors continuously say the batteries are low when they are brand new and charged and it won't take pictures. Slow between pictures when using your flash. If you have little kids, plan on missing all the shots when they are smiling. I won't buy another Canon after this experience."
4,Canon PowerShot,My daughter-in-law loves the camera. The major downfall is the limited memory capability.
1,missed many photo ops,"After putting in 2 new AA batteries I turn on the camera and it immediately turns off and I see a message on the screen that tells me I needs to change the batteries. I have had this camera for about a year and it has done this to me almost the entire time Ive had the camera. When I finally get the camera to turn on I am only able to take pictures outdoors in good natural light because I can never get the flash to work inside. I have tried using different size SD cards, tried different brands of AA batteries. Nothing is fixing the problem. There are much better camera's available at a comparable price. I have missed many photo opportunities because of this poorly made camera."
2,Horrible in low light indoors,"First of all, I am a reporter for a weekly newspaper. This camera travels with me wherever I go. I take both newsy outdoor photos and indoor photos at social functions. It's the latter that this camera really stinks. It is programmed to wait six seconds between flash photos, which, when you are taking photos of the mayor shaking hands with another dignitary, is an eternity. I end up taking an early safety shot then completely missing the real moment. Grrrr! It also is horribly grainy indoors, often to the point of being unuseable.But the camera isn't without some merits. Outdoors in good sunlight this little camera is fine. In fact, I've taken many good shots with it. The built-in movie mode is also very handy. Both the video and the sound are surprisingly good.The A530 may be OK for light home use, but it is not for the professional. I'm still impressed with Canon, however, and I'm looking at getting a higher level Canon point-and-shoot digital."
4,Nice camera for the price,"Can't compain much about the camera. Its quick to start up and focus, expose, and capture images. Images are great for a point and shoot. There is enough flexiblity to properly expose under difficult conditions too. Sometimes its a little slow to save photos to the memory card though. The redeye function doesn't seem to do much either."
3,Not Sure...,"This camera can take good quality pix, once in a while:(. good zoom, but has no B & W Feature."
2,Never seen such a sick cam...,I have got 5 cams and this one is the worst I have ever got. Its canon...its supposed to be good but I will not recommend this cam to anyone. Pay 50-60 bucks more and get a beter one...
4,Cannon Power Shot A530,"It does what I bought it to do; take good quality pictures from a basic aim and shoot camera. It came with a 16 MB memory card which isn't large enough. I installed a 520 card which is sufficent for my needs. Batteries seem to last longer in this camera then my last. I owned a similar Cannon prior to this one, but it failed the drop test. I would recommend this camera."
5,Survives nasty crashes,"I want to add that the thing is very durable.I just had a fall on the street, with the camera in my hand, so it basically absorbed much of my kinetic energy.As consequence, the camera looks horrible. The surface on one side around the lens got completely rasped away, with the deepest scratches around one third of a millimeter.But... it's completely functional!So, five thumbs up!"
4,There is nothing super surprising about the advice in this book,"The advice is obvious, but we as adults often forget that our kids are people too and we should respect them. I enjoyed reading it overall."
3,It's okay.,"To be honest, I read this awhile ago and don't remember all that much about it. I know I didn't hate it and at the time there were some points I thought were very good. Too bad I didn't write them down. :("
3,Good Book,"It had many things I knew already but it would be beneficial to have in the ""library"" for others to share."
5,Every Human Should Read This Book,This is a fantastic book on recognizing and putting into practice the basic needs of children that must be met to insure emotional health. It translates out to all interpersonal relationships and should be a must read for all parents and teachers!
5,Plenty of OMG moments,We have two boys and 1 girl. We have been struggling with some behavioral issues. I purchased this book because I felt like I was at the end of my rope and wasn't sure what else to do. This book makes total sense! It REALLY makes you think about what you are doing as a parent. DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY!
5,Powerful Insights for Everyone,It has been over 50 years since I was raising my children but reading this book has helped me become more aware of my responses to all that I encounter. I see it as the ABC's for parenting and am very excited that it is available and so reasonably priced considering the wealth of practical information. The easy to follow exercises in the book will improve awareness in every day situations that arise with ones children.It is about time that this basic information has been made so accessible and is available in several languages. I recommend this reading for everyone.
4,Hardest game Ever!,"This has to be the hardest game in history, your suit of armor blows away after getting hit only once, then you run around in your tighty whiteys until you get hit one more time and die, normally this isn't a problem like in Contra, but here there's more crap on the screen trying to kill you than an exploding portapottie. The fire ball power up sucks, showing the whole map screen everytime you die is a tease, the amount of monsters on the screen spells instant death, and if you miss certain items like the shield when reaching the end of the game you will be sent back several levels to get it. The most cruel, stupid punishment I have ever seen is the fact that when you beat the game the first time you get the ""this room is an illusion created by satan"" message and your sent back to the first level to beat it again to get a true ending that isn't even proof read lol. But over all it's a great game with a great concept. I would love to see a remake of this."
2,fabric issues,These pillowcases (and the matching sheets) felt good for the first use and then the pilled up and were really rough.
3,What could have been,"Though funny in parts and starring many of my favorite performers (the UCB, David Cross, and Jonathan Benjamin to name a few) I can't give this movie an overall good review. It really needed to have tighter editing and less needless scenes, and the plot was a little weak. Also you could tell that this was a movie finished awhile ago that just took a long time to release. However the commentary track ruled, especially because Walsh and Roberts admitted, at least that's how it semed to me, that alot of it didn't work but they had fun. If you are a UCB fan like me check it out, but don't expect the Holy Grail."
5,Great UCB commedy,"If you liked ""Upright Citizens Brigade"" in its short run on Comedy central, you'll like this DVD. Pure moronic good humor. Their humor comes from the fact that they appear to lead lives that are completely normal for them and they are the ones that would be surprised that we don't think their lives are normal."
1,M&O sucks,This was bad. Forced un-funny humor. Don't waste your time watching this. I struggled through about 1 hour of it and then dumped the DVD in the trash.
1,Movie Should Have Killed Itself Before Release,"We kept watching this flat movie, waiting and waiting for it to get funny. It never did. We enjoy dark/twisted humor & irony, but this skimpy plot was stretched beyond endurance, and the script was sad. This film that could have been hilarious missed the boat entirely. I was embarrassed for it."
5,More unique indie goodness from the Northwest...,"Mesmerizing songs... Dig this A LOT. Violins, cellos, female vocals, intricate keyboard parts and very inventive production. Unlike anything I've heard in a while. Apparently, it's the side project of another stellar NW band, The Standard. Check them out as well... Still this is a great CD and worth hearing as much as anything I've heard in a great while."
4,Valuable effort,"This album is pretty great. Sure, it's obscure, and it's not very similar to The Standard (Loch Lomond is a side-project of them), but it's still very good. Not every song is spectacular; some are a bit boring, and it's all very morose, which can be a good or bad thing depending on your tastes. I've heard some stuff from their next album, though, and it looks extremely promising. Check out their website www.lochlomondmusic.com the members of the band are good guys, I sent them an email and they personally responded (with genuine interest). I think they have a grand amount of potential, worth looking into."
2,"Case does not measure a full 24""","Good case but it only measures only 23.5"" long and it is very narrow at the zipper end. As a result my 23"" Sunpak tripod with pistol release head does not fit without forcing the zipper. A smaller head would work fine. Yes, just that little bit does make a difference. Hopefully it will stretch a bit, but that means reduced durability.Sunpak 24"" Tripod Case with Shoulder Strap"
5,Great Quality,This tripod carrying case is great. It is durable and the carrying strap is useful when your hands are full. Be sure to compare your tripod's folded dimensions to the carrying case size before ordering.
2,Criminology 7th ed Paperback,"""Criminology 7th ed Paperback"" is not correct. The book is a study guide to Siegel's book. That information is not mentioned in the description."
3,Weak story,"My 3-year-old boy just doesn't like it. Maybe in a year or so . . . but for now, the story can't hold his interest. His attention ends as soon as the treasure's found. Maybe if the photos Russell takes were less old-fashioned . . . but that's probably the appeal for some readers. My son just doesn't get them, and I don't think most small children would. He loves Russell the Sheep and Russell's Christmas Magic, however. As always, the illustrations are wonderful."
4,"good, but not as good as the first book","The first Russell the sheep book was wonderful, especially as it dealt with insomnia. My son loves both books, and the artwork is very good in both. But I have a slight preference for the first book as it deals with an ongoing challenge with young children (sleep). The ""lost treasure"" book may be better for the 5 - 7 crowd rather than the 3 - 5 crowd. Either way, it's still a good book."
4,A Great Children's Illustration Style,"You have seen Rob Scotton's work in a wide variety of places--what a pleasure to see him illustrating children's books. Light and zany, you can't help but be charmed by Scotton's characters. The story is short and simple, especially appealing for young readers or listeners, ages 3-5. The illustrations are so good, however, that you wish there was more story to necessitate more pages in the book."
2,Not as good as the original,"Love the original Russell the Sheep book and was hoping this would be as good. Not so. The title is a little decieving, there's no realy treasure hunt or anything pirate-like. My son loves the original but has never asked to re-read this one. The illustrations are really cute though, just like the original."
5,Wonderful,"I will start by saying i got this book from my public Library and came here to Amazon to Purchase the rest of the series.This book INSTANTLY became my newly turned 2 year old boy favorite book. The story, i think is perfect for his age and above and ends with a very nice lesson about family and what is truly treasured. The book is perfectly illustrated and my son points and repeats bits of the story as I go along. He knows EVERY page and will finish the sentence when i leave the last 1 or 2 words off at the end of the page. ""Silly bird"" His absolute favorite part of the story is the PHOTOS, before i even read a particular page he will say ""Steady boys"" and repeat it very hapily. Cheers to Rob Scotton and Russell. Lost Treasure is our first book about Russell but we are buying them all."
4,Strippers Unite,"This documentary is about a group of strippers in San Francisco who fight to start a union. Now they have the only union of exotic dancers in the U.S. The women decided unite when they realized they were being illegally filmed by customers in special one-way mirrors. Using a consumer grade Hi8 camera, first time director Query filmed the actions of the workers. She is also a performance artist and stand-up comic, who started dancing as a way to pay the bills."
2,"Nice clock & weather station, very poor radio","This product is something of a disappointment. I bought it to use as a clock radio, but ended up keeping it because of the weather station functions.The radio has very poor sensitivity, with none of the local FM stations receivable at full quieting.The clock works as advertised, and sets itself to WWVB.The temperature, humidity and barometer displays also work well."
1,A total piece of misrepresented junk!,"Buyer beware! This item is junk with a cheesy am/fm radio that hardly works and a power supply that keeps falling out. It is not a ""full weather"" station by any stretch of the imagination. The moon phases does not work, period.The typical protective decal that comes over the front of this features a date of 2003. This is obviously ancient stock that no one else wanted. I question the 80% savings over its last actually going price.Move on to another product."
3,Product description a little misleading.,"Pros: Nicely made easily readable, lots of features for the price.Cons: I was surprised to find that the temperature cannot be projected on the wall or ceiling like the time. The clock portion works great, but I find myself not reading the temperature because it is too small."
4,Satisfying,"I bought these hoping they'd taste like chocolate covered strawberries. They don't. However, they are pretty tasty. The chocolate is good. Contrary to how the photo looks they are not little sandwiches. The candies are solid and individually wrapped. They weren't too sweet but not bitter."
2,So much brake dust!,Maybe something else is going on but I expected less brake dusts and instead my shiny wheels are dark grey in 2 weeks! Very dissapointed since the ceramic are advertised as creating less dust but is twice as bad as the normal breaks I had on my before. Will not purchase again.
5,wonderful instrumental,I was looking for Umm Kulthum music (incredible Egyptian female singer/movie star) and found this by Ramzy. Wonderful instrumental of Kulthum music... going to buy another to see if it is actually her singing on it. If you like incredible singers Umm Kulthum is one to hear (also check out Yma Sumac from the Andes)
3,Kind of flat interpretations of some great music,"Not a bad album, but I much prefer Pe-Ko's ""Tribute to Om Kolthoum."" Plus, how seriously can I take a ""Best of Om Kolthoum"" that doesn't include ""Alf Leyla Wa Leyla"", one of the greatest songs ever written?"
2,Needs better quality images,"The bells and whistles are nice, but the image quality is terrible. The software will only work in 640x480 graphics mode, and the images are actually smaller than that. I'd estimate the resolution to be around 30-50 dpi at best, which makes it nearly impossible to see the smaller, fine details on many plates, and often it is impossible to tell exactly where the leader lines are going. For the amount of money it costs, it ought to be much better."
5,Race with the Devil,The movie was just like I had remebered. I had read one review where the viewer said the movie was hard to see and there was a lot of red tones in it. The one I purchased was perfect and I enjoyed seeing it again after all of these years. Great purchase! Great movie!
4,RACE WITH THIS DEVIL,"I remember watching this on a Sat afternoon.Channel 9 always played this one.This movie freaked me out{i was only 10} when I first saw it.Frank and Roger{Warren Oates,Peter Fonda} take their wives{Laura Parker,Loretta Swift}on a vacation to Colorado.During a rest the two men witness a Satanic Ritual across the water.They are spotted and the chase is on!The thing that made this movie was as a viewer pointed out was that these people are normal looking.This added much to the creepiness.I always loved the pool scene.Its funny how Laura Parker always gets the stares and not Loretta Swift.The director Jack Starrett has a small role as a gas station attendant. Its filled with car chases which was popular back then and not so much today.I have to keep in mind too that this was 1975 and low budget.Its still is a great movie!"
2,A little too ridiculous,"The ridiculousness that I'm referring to is the idea that all the small towns across Texas that these poor people happen to drive through are all somehow in league with this goofy band of Satanists who the protagonists accidentally witness early on in the movie. The existence of this secret network of Satanists and Satanist-sympathizers across the heart of Texas is never explained. I mean, I don't have a great impression of most Texans either, but come on."
4,Liked the movie,"This movie was very watchable, better than the average for this Genre. Warren Oates is always enjoyable to watch in any movie."
3,Good Drive In Movie from the past,"I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid. It is a mix of action, car chase, and horror movie. It stars Peter Fonda and Warren Oates as two buddies who buy an RV and take their wives on a cross country trip. They have a pretty cool dirt bike race between the competitive friends and there is some nice riding in that scene. Also this movie is full of some pretty cool stunts. These are even more cool when you think that back in the day people actually rode those bikes, drove those cars and did all the stunts. In a day of CGI this is just amazing. The story is not Shakespeare but it is fun as the couples run across a ritualistic murder and are then chased by the cult. The paranoia and true fear grows and grows as they race across country in fear of their lives.This movie is kind of dated but it is still fun to watch. And for those of you who saw it back in the day, I think you will still enjoy it."
4,Superb movie about devil worshipping,"I first watched this movie when I was a young child and I didn't understand alot of it, but for some reason it just stuck with me. When I finally watched it as an adult, I thought it was just as scary as when I was young. Its one of those horror movies that can very much come to life. It seemed like all the people were very normal, but it turns out that EVERYONE is a devil worshipper and they are all watching the vacationers, even as they travel from town to town. It leaves you with an eerie feeling that will stay with you."
4,Scared the Crud out of me when I was 11,"Hi There,I saw this with my buddy Mitch when I was 11 and after the show we took a cab home (My first cab ride) We were scared to death. What memories. I dunno if seeing it again will scare me like the first time, I kinda doubt it but thinking about it now gives me shivers and brings back the old fears of devil worshippers and the like."
1,Awful- but great ending,"Okay so I saw this movie when I was very young and remembered nothing about it but the ending- which I talked about as one of my faves. I have recently rediscovered it and it is painful to watch it is so bad, and I like campy B movies."
3,Race With the Devil--Good action,"I went to see this movie as a kid at the theater. I remember the audience yelling and clapping during the chase scenes. I enjoyed it just as much all these years later. The plot is fairly simple....after witnessing a human sacrifice the people get pursued for miles and days by the cult members. The movie is still somewhat scary and suspensful in a ""B"" movie sort of way. The DVD has some good extras to it like the interview with Peter Fonda."
4,Classic Horror Flick,"This film is definitely one to be watched. Horror films today are too glossy! This film will keep you on the edge of your seat. There is one suprise after another all throughout. It's one of the best ""B"" films I've seen. It's a movie that will make you scared to go camping (even more so than ""The Blair Witch Project"") So grab it and a tub of popcorn and enjoy."
3,That's the Last Human Sacrifice I Attend,"I saw this film at my local bijou twice when I was a teenager, once on a double-bill with ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid""(?) and another time with ""Bound for Glory""(?!). I purchased this film out of some sort of misplaced nostalgia. That's not to say that this film doesn't contain it's share of scares or the chase and action scenes don't deliver some thrills. Watching it again almost thirty years later leads me to believe that this is good Saturday afternoon matinee fare that would appeal mostly to an adolescent mindset. It's also what you would call a good drive-in date movie whether you care to watch the movie or not."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:As long as you don't take this 1975 Henry Fonda/Warren Oates vehicle too seriously, you'll probably appreciate its simple take of average Joes beset on all sides by middle-American weirdos; by no means art, it's a functional-enough little chase film."
5,real smart,person with the review if you had those razors which do you even know how to use and pointed it at secruty guard hed problypull out a gun so dont do that goodbye
2,Never Received.,Amazon ignored my complaint about corrupt download. I never received any download to this product. Though my digital media libray has 107 items in it
1,flex,"when you pay $27 for a stop block that doesn't always lock in squarely and it flexes, somethings wrong!"
2,Significant Play in flipstop,"I also have found the flipstop to have play. You can tighten the nut, which decreases it, but then everything gets too tight for moving up and down. Expect more like .030 (1/32) if the stop is tight and .060 (1/16) if it is loose. I only use my production stop, the flipstop sits in its box. I am doing precision cuts - picture frame miters - and this would be far too much tolerance for me."
3,a little slop in the connection,"I expect a lot from Kreg. I pay a premium and should get what I pay for with their products. I was a little disappointed that there is a little play from side to sideafter swinging the stop into the down position. No question it is designed to only be used to push against the thumbscrew section, not away from it."
5,Fantastic,I love all of her books. When you have one in hand you can't leave it until reading the end!
5,Wonderful descriptive book!,Another great book by Jennifer Chiaverini! Love the characters! They show real depth and are facing a major life stress. Always a pleasure to read her books!
4,The Quilter's Homecoming,Now this was worthwhile and I enjoyed reading it immensely. I liked the intertwining of the 1800's story line with the 1920's and how they came together. Looking forward to more info on Elizabeth and Henry's fate after the end of this book.
4,The Quilter's Homecoming,"This was a good story, however, I was a little disappointed in how itended. I hoped they would get back to Pennsylvania and tell the truthabout what happened to them."
3,Still a good read,"Would really rate it about 3.5 stars- I enjoyed it but it's not my favorite. I prefer the ones in the series that are more about the main core of characters. I have read the other books but didn't actually recall Elizabeth being mentioned. Still, the way Chiaverini weaves quilting throughout her stories is always clever and crafty- definitely worth reading."
4,A Super READ!,"I have been a big fan of the Jennifer Chiaverini books. I just adore the Elm Creek Quilts novels. There are plenty of reviews so I'll be brief, except to say this is a wonderful novel and worthy of your time and money. Read and Enjoy."
4,California dreams for newlyweds,"This is the 10th book in the Elm Creek Quilters series and this one is a purely historical story. We see Elizabeth, the older cousin of the current owner of Elm Creek Manor as she and her newlywed husband, Henry travel to California to start a new life in the 1920's. Her family has given her 2 quilts as wedding gifts and they play a role in the story. When they arrive, they find that they have been victims of a fraudelent land deal and their life savings are gone. Instead of owning the farm, they both go to work as hired hands on the property that they thought would be theirs. Interspersed with this story is that of Isabel, a member of the family who originally owned the land and whose family came on hard times. The two stories come together for an interesting conclusion. The story was good and the period details were nice. The relationship between Henry and Elizabeth was a little odd, but it wasn't too off-putting. Overall, it was a pleasant story."
3,a time to remeber what it was like to be a kid,these brought me back to wharn i was 7 years old and seeing a charlie brown xmas for the first time.
4,Life on the Edge for Graduates,"If you are college bound this book is a great choice for you! It gives specific guidelines to help you find a career, pursuit, purpose and mate. Dr. Dobson helps you by giving you tips on decision making, especially tough ones in your future. If you are struggling with any of these issues you should pick up this book and read it! Dr. Dobson is a great Christian author who ties Jesus Christ into all of his sections of this book. This especially is a great book for Christians because they can really relate to what the author is talking about, but it is good for non-Christians or non-religious people as well. I would recommend this book to anyone who is making important decisions in thier life, particularly ones for thier future."
4,Helpful for older high schoolers,This book is well written for high school juniors and seniors; it is Biblically sound teaching.
1,Bigotry,"This book has lots of good advice for those navigating the college years. However, this book is homophobic, and therefore, I must give it a poor rating. Preaching hate is not what I want to find in a Christian book. The book offers bad advice on how to treat homosexuals, and has no advice for homosexuals reading the book."
1,The worst rubbish ever put to print,"This is most poorly written and ennui-ridden piece of rubbish I have ever perused. The false self-righteousness and inarticulate posturing is better left to neo-nazis than to a ""supposed"" spiritual guide. These insipid ramblings left me sorely dissapointed. Buyer beware."
3,Perhaps too practical,"I am a 19 year old seeking guidance on how to become a successful and trusting Christian. I certainly did enjoy reading Dr. Dobson's valuable insight, but I felt that ""Life on the Edge"" was rather short on bible verses and teachings to back it all up. For example, whenever Dr. Dobson describes something as a sin, such as living with a partner before marriage, he ought to prove it by use of the Bible. Nevertheless, the psychological teachings and advice makes the book worth a read. :)"
5,must read for all 16-26 yr olds.,"I'm nearly done reading this book, and although I'm well past my teen/young adult years, there are numerous things that are helpful or for anyone at any age. It is easy to read, conversational at times, and contains many stories and examples that make it interesting and read fast. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants help navigating the treacherous waters of life and I would consider it ""required reading"" for the target audience of 16-26 year olds."
3,Life on the edge,"I appreciate your timely matter in mailing the book. I would like to have known the edition, since I was looking for the current edition and this is an older edition. Perhaps you could list the edition next time so one could know whether it is the current or earlier edition. Thank you."
4,Good quality and fun,"I bought this costume for a school project but I also have a three year old daughter. She loved the outfit. She played with the (small) dog and shot it with the syringe/needle quite a few times. It has a large cloth band-aid around its stomach. The costume was a bit big for my daughter but the age range for the costume is 3 to 7. The stethoscope was to large for her head but she was happy wearing it around her neck. It lights up and makes noise, and she pretended that she was listening to her chest/heart. My only real complaint was the size of the mask, it is much to big for most young children. I am thinking about putting a small stitch in both sides because she really wants to wear it."
1,I did not bother to finish this book...,"""The Wilde Women"" has a negative atmosphere and there was nothing humorous about it, IMO. I kept reading, hoping it would get better. By the time I got 40% of the way into it, I gave myself permission to shelf it. Not one of the characters was sympathetic to me, nor did I even like any of them."
5,Receives veteran Susan Ericksen's smooth voice,"Paula Wall's THE WILDE WOMEN receives veteran Susan Ericksen's smooth voice and stage and screen background as it tells of sisters who have a taste for mischief and bad men. When one sister cheats with another's man, trouble begins which will lead to changes and danger."
2,A group of funny short stories woven into a novel,"This book was not what I expected. Not to say that it wasn't good- but I expected a romance novel featuring the Wilde Women. 85% of the book is about characters in the small town. In fact only about 2% of the entire book features the Wilde Women's interaction with the men who end up with them!The author was definitely very witty, the interaction among the characters in the books well represented, but from chapter to chapter there was no real continuation. It felt like a collection of short stories connected by a shared setting. I would have enjoyed this book much more if I didn't pick it up with the expectation that I would be reading a romance novel."
3,Fun fluff book,A fun read based around the Wilde sisters and the relationships between men and women. The conflict in the book is diluted by the author's insistence on including the relationships of every married couple in town as if they matter. No real plot here but the writing is straight forward and amusing if occasionally overly critical of women and the choices they make. Good fluff book for anyone who just wants to escape in a completely predictable book.
1,DON'T Order this from Payloadz ebook download by NorthernLightsVintage!!!!,"On Payloadz, it will say Digitaldownloadebooks.com as the seller, but it's actually Northernlightsvintage. They're also on ebay. They also have a website.I ordered this as an ebook and the PDF says I can view the patterns in another window but it won't work. They turn out tiny and blurry. The seller will never ans your emails, either. A rip off!"
4,Great Short Read!,"I really enjoyed this book!Very action-packed and interesting. You never really slow down at all. You're jumping from tall buildings and running from ancient evil.It is well written and easy to understand. It was a bit on the short side, which in many ways is great - you don't have to set aside hours and hours to be able to enjoy it.I say it's worth the buy!"
5,Best Kept Secret,I really love this CD and really looking to hear more from Mr. Barrington (bo) Henderson this is Cd # two thank you
2,Typographical errors make this edition unusable,"The Verso 2009 version of this book (the ""Radical Thinkers"" paperback) is teeming with typographical errors. It seems like the manuscript has been prepared by use of an OCR machine reading of the older 1970/1997 edition. The machine, as is to be expected, has made various mistakes. These have largely not been corrected by Verso's editor. This is incredibly sloppy work on the publisher's behalf and makes for a very serious shortcoming of this book. Some of the errors are relatively harmless, but others create ambiguities (e.g. missing quotation marks). For this reason, I would not recommend using this edition of the book as a reference or for serious study purposes."
4,Difficult but fascinating interpretation of Marx,"This is Althusser's and Balibar's unique interpretation of key methodological features of Marx's 'Capital'. The book launched a school of thought within Marxism, sometimes labeled Althusserian Marxism and sometimes Structuralist Marxism. Althusser was to later engage in self-criticism of some of its key concepts, such as the demarcation bewteen science and ideology, but much of its epistemology (esp. a division between theoretical and real objects, and scientific practice being a process of 'knowledge-production') and ontology (esp. multi-dimensional causality) remain valuable, interesting and fresh. That said, this is a difficult work not only because it requires extensive background knowledge of Marx and philosophy of science, and not only because the arguments are long and involved, but also because of the annoying use of neologisms (e.g. 'overdetermination') and unusual definitions of common words (e.g. 'empiricism')."
4,Lilian Too's Easy-to-use Feng Shu,"I found Lillian's book for a beginner very intersting.It was a very easy to follow book, with great ideas and tips for all ages, and in almost every subject one could desire, I have adapted some of her ideas and put them into practice, especially energising rooms, tables and desktops.Re-arranging the bedroom is another idea which I have used and it has worked well..."
2,Disappointing,"Only a small fraction of this book pertains to living space. The rest is somewhat confusing advice about makeup and hairstyles and where to sit during meetings at work and where to place your phone at work and the best type of corporate logos for buildings and good luck charms and things like that. And the author's feng shui advice is VERY specific to exactly what she likes, rather than feng shui principles. And the pictures for the small living space section would show a bad feng shui room as often as a good room, but never a good room to correct the bad room. I got the impression the interior photos, as well as most of the other photos, were taken from a selection of stock photos, not designed for this book."
5,This is one of the most inspirational books I have ever read,I have known about Feng Shui for many years but never felt inspired to impliment it until I came across Lillian Too's Feng Shui. It was so simple and really gave me the feeling that I could indeed make dramatic changes in my life. I have made phenominal changes since reading this book. In addition I have inspired many others to purchase this book because of my enthusiasm. There are a number of business associates who have helped me in my career and I will be purchasing the book for them as a thank you gift. I have tried to find this book in the bookstores and it is always sold out. I carry my copy around with me like a bible in my attempt to memorize many key factors. It's the best. I highly recommend it.
3,It is just another feng shui book!,Lillian Too's Easy-to-Use Feng Shui: 168 Ways to Success by Lillian Too is a good book and he emphasises a lot of feng shui teaching. But I find it the price a bit expensive compared to other feng shui book which also stress similar feng shui topic .
5,Loved It,Nice triple feature. Fun movie times. Great price for entertainment. The best part is we had not seen any of these movies.
5,Unstrung Heroes,"Excellent! This movie is fabulous! I haven't watched Simple Twist of Fate, nor First Do No Harm. I plan on watching these in the future."
3,right choice,this is the thing i was searching for. and got it at the right time. it made me work easily for my house hold work as well as for my job work as a technician. thanks to the quality of the set u made shirish
4,Shocking,"""The Lost Land"" stands out from Boland's previous collections for its precise, cutting indictments of the colonists and the repression in Irish history. The poem ""The Necessity For Irony"" shocked me as well, and other poems such as ""Heroic"" voiced those nagging feminist desires to be heroic and triumphant. In all, a complex and divining collection that rings with meaning (for women, and for poets, at least) that has trouble with the short, dense sentences that can bore after awhile."
1,Postcolonialism by numbers,"This is a flat and formulaic book from a writer churning out a sort of postcolonialism by numbers, smugly confident of her direct line to the hidden truths about Irish history. This hidden truth about Irish history seems to be, surprise surprise, that it culminates in the poetry of Eavan Boland. Boland was already overrated in comparison to many of her Irish contemporaries, but this is easily her worst book to date."
3,"OK, BUT SHOULD'VE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER","THIS TIME, SONNY CHIBA RETURNS TO BUST UP A PHONY CHARITY THAT'S BEING PUT TOGETHER BY THE YAKUZA. I MUST SAY, THIS MOVIE STARTED OFF BORING, BUT AFTER A WHILE, IT GETS A LITTLE BETTER. GREAT FIGHTS NONETHELESS, BUT, THE STORY ISN'T AS HALF AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL. STILL, IF YOU WANNA SEE MORE OF SONNY CHIBA AT HIS YOUNGER DAYS, RENT OR BUY THIS FILM, BUT, IF YOU WANNA SEE THE ABSOLUTE BEST OF SONNY CHIBA, RENT OR BUY THE ORIGINAL."
2,Lydia,"This watch is not as solid as it looks. The bracelet is very fragile, and the whole watch does not seems to be tough enough for diving. Will not buy this brand anymore."
4,Beautiful Watch,"This is a beautiful watch. I am happy with my purchase and it is a nice addition to my watch collection. I had to go get a couple links removed for size. One thing I am disappointed with is that the rotating bezel is hard to move and therefore not very functional, but I didn't order this for a sport watch so not much of a problem just a disappointment."
4,Heavy - with the weight of its' destiny!,"I bought this for a kung fu instructor that's a friend of mine. It appears to be entirely steel that has been painted the colors you see in the picture. He's been using it for martial forms and it is sturdy in that regard; although it's rather heavy. The weight is a benefit from a training aspect, but the momentum it builds up is tricky to manage. I can't comment on the case because this article is hanging from his wall."
4,Overall good backpack.,Both me and my daughter like this backpack. I don't get to backpack much so I do have a little back/shoulder soreness if I use the pack for long periods. I have had other packs that also caused soreness so I think it just comes with the territory if you're not a constant backpacker. The pack was easy to get on and off with my daughter in it - I can get it on while it is sitting on the ground. I love the adjustments for baby on this pack and there is ample room to where baby is not smushed up against the back of my head. I read other reviews where people were not able to get the stabilizer bar open/closed while the pack was on and I found this to be no problem at all - you just reach behind your back and pop it closed or open.
2,style over substance,"I'm not a strong Rob bell fan so for those of you who are fans, no offence. Some of his Nooma videos I like, some I don't.The book has not so much to do with sex, only indirectly. he spends time talking about the dignity of the human body and that we have deeper issues in our souls...Bell is an extremely gifted communicator who tells stories which are profound, though not nearly as profound as Bell tries to make them out to be. At the end of a chapter one feels moved, but upon reflection when I asked myself what he actually said or what I learned the answer was...very little.Great style, little substance."
4,Well Done!,This book is very eye opening and a great read. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to expand their mind and really understand the bible.
4,"Age-Old Subject, New Ideas","I would recommend ""Sex God"" to anyone really -- whether you're in a casual relationship or completely celibate. In the book, Rob Bell approaches the often-avoided topic of sex with practicality and an open mind.I didn't feel this book pushed a particular agenda or preached. It simply explored. Bell offers a range of ideas formed around the framework of a strong faith in God. What is sex? How is God expressed in sex? Is it OK for us to have sex? What does sex mean? All these urgent questions are approached tactfully and frankly at the same time.I enjoyed this read."
5,Amazing wedding and pre-marital info,"I finished Sex God just in time to plagiarize it for a wedding that I did last weekend. The official release date was March 1, and wedding was on March 3rd, so the book couldn't have been more timely.Now that I have finished it, I keep thinking of people that I want to hand it off to. It's not that the book reminded me of so and so, whose really struggling and needs to read it, as much as knowing that I was personally impacted in such a neat real way, that I want to share it with others.It's incredibly refreshing to see how unapologetically Rob Bell uses Sexuality to connect man/woman to God. Sex is brought into the light. You get the feeling that Sex is being taken back from those who have given it over to the adversary, being restored in God's kingdom and God's conversation with His creation."
3,"good, not great","I love Rob Bell and was really looking forward to reading this book. I found the chapter titles interesting, but was somewhat disappointed with the content. There were plenty of thought provoking ideas and perspectives, but overall I felt it to be dreary. I would recommend reading it, I may even give it another shot and try it again in a year. Maybe I missed something or need to be at another place in my life. Either way, I think Bell is bright, interesting and has a wonderful perspective on Christianity and our role in this life."
2,Dosen't live up to the title...,"Not as good as Velvet Elvis by far, but an ok read in Rob Bell's Style. The book focues mainly on relationships touching somewhat on sex and Bell's thoughts on the subject but I found very little exploration into connections between sexuality and spirituality. Highly disapointed."
5,well worth the read,"Really enjoyed this book, it delivered what it promised - a contemporary view of Christian Sexuality. Not just a book on rules and guidelines telling Christians why to or not to date, but a theology of sexuality. Very practical and well grounded in Biblical foundations."
4,Fabulous perspective with an easy approach,"With it's provocative title, this book can seem like something to be afraid of. on the contrary, Rob Bell does an excellent job at not only sharing a fair perspective of sex and spirituality both with and without Christian orientation, but he also walks the reader through it quite easily. With an almost Socratic approach, the reader can realize meanings and derive personal conclusions through the authors suggestive questioning (much more pleasant than if the auther were to share an epiphany and use the rest of the book as means of persuasion, especially with such a bold subject)"
4,Title that grabs your attention,"Sex God is not just some book about sex. Its an intimate look into the human soul. It is the author's second book. It is creative, thoughtful, and purposeful. Bell continues to push the boundaries of the Christian faith and looks at things from a new angle. The link between spirituality and sexuality is not often talked about, pick up the book and check it out, you wont be dissapointed."
5,A must read for teen agers and up,"This book opened my eyes to the connections between sexuality and spirituality. I found it relevant and true. Both me and my husband read the book. I love how Rob Bell is able to explain such a complicated subject matter with clarity and deep understanding. I think that if I had read this as a teenager, I would have had a better perspective about how God created people to deal with their sexuality. Very meaningful."
2,Not at all what I expected,"This book was terrible. Although it had some vaguely good points, it mainly oscilated between being irrelevant to inappropriate."
4,What it's all about,"As I have read through some of these reviews I am sad to say that I believe that people have been misguided by simply the title of the book. Personally I am a huge Bell fan and I understand that this lends me biases that others do not share. This aside though, I believe that Bell does and amazing job lending and ear to the topic of sex without saying ""This is what it's all about"" sex as I feel he points out, is much deeper than that. I think this book is a great read and is a true help to those who are curious about what God feels on this topic without sounding patronizing to the believer or non believer. I see Bell as the man I would like to get to know and pick his brain apart because he brings a new fresh view to some outdated philosophies. By mixing sound theology with a monologue style of writing his books are not only hard hitting but also extremely relatable."
3,Please Read This Prior to Reading,Rob Bell is a really nice guy. But check his doctrines and be weary of false doctrines. The truth is not always what you are itching to hear. Not a hater. He has some good stuff to say. And some stuff is completely wrong. Just be careful to discern.Check out:[...][...]
2,Antiquated,"Should have looked more closely at the author before purchasing. Although it's a refreshing view of the beauty of sex and the spiritual connection it creates between you and God, it also has a very conservative sexual undercurrent. My sense was that the author would not consider a queer relationship as applicable to his theory and he also strongly advocates for abstinence before marriage, which is something that I think is antiquated."
1,Very disappointing,"Spelling errors throughout, chapter review answers often wrong. I can't believe a CCIE would put his name to this. Extremely disappointing. It looks like this book was rushed to print. Cisco Press should be ashamed of themselves."
4,Most useful baby product,This is the second one I've bought as a gift. Baby backpack was the most useful baby product when mine was smaller. This version seems sturdy and lightweight.
2,Not made for a woman,I was going to order this backpack but wanted to try it out first. I went to a local store with a friend and tried this thing out. The sternum strap would not even snap over my chest...I have an average build but have a chest....and it would'nt reach. My friend tried it also and had the same problem. I would suggest that if you are interested in this carrier you find one and try it on first or it could be a costly mistake.
4,work of art,"A beautiful camera to look at, as everybody does. The good points are; (in simple language) 1) Control, a lot. 2)Fast, under certain conditions. 3) Tilting view screen. 4) Remote cable access. 5) Outside buttons, a really good idea 6)Manual zoom control 7)Terrific flash. The poor points; 1)All digitals so far, have the problem of stopping movement in the shade, so does the E-20n.2)Heavy. Can't help that though, with all that great glass. 3)The control knobs have a tendency to move when they shouldn't. Maybe a rub with the elbo, or hand or case or whatever. I have lost some great shots because of incorrect settings. What i do is use black electrical tape. I have it all over the camera, making sure things stay the way i want them. It works! and no sticky stuff later !! None the less, I love this camera"
3,"Uneven, But Not Without Its Merits","Thankfully, Schom has (for the most part) an entertaining command of his words. His 800 pages do begin to weigh heavily as his incessant browbeating of Napoleon seems only to grow more and more venomous, but in spite of his constant barrage of opinion he manages to rather deftly weave together the pieces of the tale in an amusing way. The most memorable moments of Schom's work come during his tales of the assassination attempts against Bonaparte and the descriptions of the world that surrounded the Emperor. Schom's insights into Bonaparte are (almost comically) undermined by his hatred for the man, even to the point of claiming that Napoleon's brilliant victory at Austerlitz was the result of luck rather than strategy. All in all, it is a worthwhile read best taken with a grain or two of salt. (Oh, and if you read this Mr. Schom, you may want to ease up a bit on the exclamation points in the future!)"
2,If This Were A Term Paper...,"...I can't imagine Professor Schom would fail to note with disgust the large number of typographical and grammatical errors which mar the content. Given his aggressively one-sided argument, Schom can't afford to look so careless. While entertaining and exhaustive in certain aspects, the book is leaves enormous areas uncovered: Why did Napoleon come to power? What was the exact source of his military genius (he couldn't have won all those battles on luck alone)? What was the Code Napoleon? What were the long term effects of his reign? Schom almost seems like he believes that Napoleon was simply a sadistic bungler who through enormous luck stumbled ass-backward into conquering half of Europe. There has to be more to it than that, which isn't something you should find yourself thinking after reading an 800 page biography."
1,Wellington Fanatic Disses French Egomaniac,"Mr. Schom is a Wellington scholor who has written perhaps the best book on that great British general, the nemesis of Napoleon and the cause of Napoleon's eventual demise. Needless to say, Schom is completely biased against Napoleon's good characteristics, or even his bad characteristics that proved effective tools in his rise to power and domination of the world stage. Read someone else's book about Napoleon, and then do youself a big favor and get the Wellington side of the saga from the redoubtable Mr. Schom-- one of the best history books I ever read, much as his Napoleon was one of the worst."
3,"Biased and incomplete, but entertaining",Exhaustive analysis of Napoleon from beginning to end. Good as an introduction or deep research. Well written and entertaining.
1,Napoleon is not Hitler,"Why is it that when I was done reading this book, the author left a feeling that Napoleon was some sort of a warmongering scumbag, a 19th century version of Adolf Hitler with no redeeming value? I was bit shocked at the level of bias that the author had against Napoleon. Actually I shouldn't be since I read couple of his earlier books and they were definitely anti-Napoleon in nature. To called this book a ""hatchet job"" on Napoleon cannot be too far from the truth. The author really seem to distaste Napoleon and I am afraid that make him totally unfit to write his biography. If you hate Napoleon, then this book is for you. If you want a more fair and objective biography, please look else where."
2,A poor vision of Napoleon,"I opened Adam Schom's book with high hopes. A one volume biography of Napoleon that should at least give me the bones of his life and impact. But Schom is fundamentally a military historian and it shows in page after page. He does not focus on the important legal and administrative changes that Napoleon introduced throughout his reign. His rule meant that the Aristorocracy could never hope to return to France in the way they ruled before the revolution. Schom basically ignores the French Revolution and its aftermath. He tells little of the social and political whirlpool that led to Bonaparte taking power. His refusal to even acknowledge the existence of the Code Napoleon is staggering and leaves this volume with a great hole that no amount of love affairs and military campaigns can fill. The correct title should have been a military biography, but little else. A grave disappointment."
1,napoleon bonaparte by a schom,I give it at least one star only because it was a quick read. I think Mr. Schom's Anglophile's slip is showing.
1,Garbage,"This book is garbage the author really seems to hate Napoleon, and think all his genius was luck, everything about the bonapartes is evil according to this author. I'd pay more for paper towels than this book"
1,so biased as to be untrustworthy in its information,"This book is so biased as to be ridiculous. Napoleon is a ""lucky"" general who apparently didnt have any real military talent. He is also a merciless thug. Any real achievements (ie. the napoleonic code, the scientific aspects of the egypt expedition are ignored). A worthless read"
2,Disorganized and Disappointing -- I agree,"When I bought the book here there were no reviews here yet. I came back to say what was said very well under ""Disorganized and Disappointing."" I fully agree with that assessment. The part about the book being badly edited doesn't exaggerate. The maps are worthless.The book would be 50 pages shorter if the useless, confusing battle descriptions were greatly pruned. This might have been used to expand on the Code Napoleon, and other social reforms he supposedly instituted, and to add more anecdotes of his behavior which might shed light on the man. I have been told of a few by a knowledgeable French informant.Disorganized and hard to follow, one won't understand Napoleon when done - just know a few highlights of his life. And you certainly won't like Napoleon, but I don't yet know if this is a fair judgement or not. This was my first biography of the man.I don't feel that this will set the standard on biographies of Napoleon Bonaparte."
2,"Weak on battle strategy, hyper-critical of Naopleon.",I have read numerous better books on Napoleon. Mr. Schom easily confuses during descriptions of Napoleons campaigns and battles. This is compunded several-fold by the near total absence of maps. It appears hardly credible to me that Napoleon was as stupid or as lucky as Mr. Schom would have us believe. I'll stick to Chandler or Zweig.
3,ugly but decent,"I agree with the basic points of other reviewers: this book is extremely biased against Napoleon even though the author proclaims himself neutral; the maps are inadequate; and the treatment of psychology and motivation is shallow. I want to add that the writing style is primitive, poorly edited, with awkward grammar, sometimes confusing basic points. It reads like the work of an amateur scholar. The author is in command of his facts but not of his story. Nonetheless, the facts are there, and the inherent quality of the subject matter makes up for bad craftsmanship. This a readable book, though not a great one. Somebody tell us if another book is better: McLynn? Tulard?"
3,A Detailed But Flawed Biography,"I disagree with a lot of the readers about this biography being slow. Schom is a good writer, and I found this to be a relatively quick read. Simply, Schom tears Napoleon to shreds. Whether it concerns the failed Egyptian campaign, or Napoleon's actions on the battlefield and at home, Schom finds something wrong and ""evil"" in Napoleon's actions. The flaw is that he does not create a non-biased account. Schom ignores key policies such as the Napoleonic Code, etc., that other previous reviewers have also found to be flaws in the biography.However, on the flip side, this book is very, very detailed. Schom presents numerous sources, although like one reader said, a few might not be trustworthy. In the end, this is a good book, but readers who expect impartiality should avoid Schom's biography."
1,Alan Schom is an unabashed Napoleon-basher,"This book was terrible. Schom's biography of Napoleon was so one-sidedly critical of Napoleon while simultaneously praising the British that I couldn't finish it. While Napoleon certainly had his faults, this book seeks to construe any available fact the author was able to dig up as a sweeping indictment of the Emperor. Pages and pages of financial figures are twisted into stinging criticisms of Napoleon's excess and largess, while entirely ignoring historical context. The author wants you to believe that Bonaparte was uniquely corrupt, rather than a product of his age. Schom's tone is so overwhelmingly negative that the reader finds it difficult to believe that such an apparently incompetent person could have possibly conquered the entirety of Europe with such a ""reasonable"" enemy as Great Britain standing in the way.I strongly recommend you pass over this awful book."
1,A Pathetic Joke,"How starved for attention and recognition can people be! But be careful what you wish for. Schom portrays Napoleon as an incompetent, bungling general who simply stumbled into numerous victories, because his enemies were even less competent and very, very hapless. Bonaparte crushed his enemies and became emperor, during some of the most uncertain times in human history, as a result of luck and some intrigue. Sounds plausible? This book is a perfect example of self-aggrandizing, revisionist scholarship. Schom wants to look big by making Napoleon as small as possible, and it's pathetic. What a waste of knowledge in pursuit of vanity!"
2,Who needs Wellington when there is Schom?,"Having read other biographies of Napoleon, and having just driven over the col de Saint Bernard, I was really looking forward to this book. The details are almost all there, but coloured with such a jaundiced view that the great man has been dragged down. Schom concentrates on the gory, the downsides, neglecting the triumphs and genuine achievements or casting such a doubt on them you begin to wonder why other authors have made such a fuss. He presents Napoleon as a Himmler or Hitler rather than a Patton or Caesar. I have rarely read a biography which was so negative towards it's principal."
1,Don't Read This If You Want A Balanced Look At Napoleon,"This book is just absolutely ridiculous and is proof that ANY Napoleon book can be published because he's such a popular subject. Napoleon more than any other figure in history has been the victim of a 200 year smear campaign and is held to a double standard that no other figure in history is held to. It's almost as if he was so good at everything that people treat him as some sort of demigod and judge his actions as if he wasn't a normal human being. Nowhere can that be found more than in this ""book"". It's obvious that Alan Schom is in awe of the emperor but feels embarassed of that fact so wrote a book in order to convince himself that Napoleon was in fact a mortal man and not the superman of his dreams. Alan Schom is just a kid writing a book and to those of us who are well versed in the Napoleonic story this is just laughable fodder.In other words its a VERY unbalanced look at Napoleon which should be avoided by....everbody."
4,Biased and bitchy,"Whilst biased against Bonaparte (the author demotes all achievements to luck or contributions of others) this still has much to offer through its warped-but-entertaining catty-European-bitchy tone. Kinda like steeping down onto the pier for a few moments on a windy day - you wouldn't want to stay too long, but a nice breezy change from the honest fogs of other bios like Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton.June 24 addendum: Cath Zeta Jones buys this very book in Speilberg's immigrant propaganda movie ""The Terminal""."
3,Napoleon must have been blessed by Fortuna,"*I finished this book truly believing Napoleon to be the luckiest man who ever set foot upon this planet. If I had taken my middle school physical education exams with as little preparation as Napoleon apparently put into his campaigns, then I would certainly not be in the same self-important position that I now am. Either Napoleon is the finest command-by-the-seat-of-your-pants strategist EVER, or Napoleon's enemies couldn't have won a third grade game of hide and seek. *Inexplicably, close to absolutely nothing is mentioned regarding Napoleon's monumental achievements, including (but certainly not limited to) the Napoleonic Code. *I must admit, I did quite enjoy Mr. Schom's treatment of the circus that was Napoleon's circle - you thought your high school clique liked to gossip!"
3,a good read,"This book flowed well, and provided a good overall portrait of the life of Napoleon but I felt it seemed to gloss over many events in his life and military campaigns."
2,bad,"have you ever watched a bad movie and there was that guy who kept kicking himself in the head and laughing in disbelief at the blatany stupidity. this is how schom talks the whole time, and you have to listen. good events though, although i dont know if he left anything out. read this and then an account from a different author."
4,"A very good read, to be taken with a grain of salt.","A very entertaining book. People have criticized its one-sidedness, but every history reflects the biases of the historian. It's fairly obvious when Schom has an ax to grind, so one can easily draw one's own conclusions. This kept me entertained for several weeks."
2,"Too much on military campaigns, too little on Napoleon.","Having little familiarity with the life of Napoleon, I eagerly began reading Schom's biography. Unfortunately, even after 800 pages, I do not find feel I gained much of an understanding of this complex figure. To begin, Schom largely glosses over Napoleon's formative years, giving very few details about his years in Corsica or as a student. Once Napoleon becomes an important military figure, Schom then focuses too-exclusively on military campaigns and battles (with generally useless maps) while not delving sufficiently into the social and political environment in France. The author should not assume, as he does, that readers will be familiar with many of the details of the French Revolution, and he should include some more background on that turbulent period that saw Napoleon rise to power.Thus, while providing some education on the continual campaigns of Napoleon, the author does little to provide a well-rounded understanding of this figure."
1,Absolute garbage,"There's a difference between being critical towards a historical figure and outright hating them. Schom not only makes it clear he despises Napoleon, but at no point in the book could I tell if he was even interested in the subject he was writing about. Avoid this book at all costs!"
2,lacks feeling,"I was surprised by the weak narrative and somewhat crude writing style. The author appeared to have a dislike for his subject which leads me to ask a question-""Why would he commit so much of his time to write this book?""Complaints: Maps, over-use of exclamation points (!!!), horrible coverage of the rebellion in Haiti and the Louisianna Purchase.Compliments: Easy book to skim through.Conclusion: look elsewhere for a Napoleon biography. The only reason I read it was because a friend forced it on me and I felt obligated. Compared to Manchester's ""American Ceasar"" this book is a joke."
2,Detailed but Biased,"Before I read this book, I knew little about Napoleon and his times other than the fact that he tried to take over the Europe and was an excellent General. This book taught me a lot of facts, but that is all I can really say.Schom is very biased in the book, and ironically he states that he wishes, as an American since America was not involved in the war(well, there was the War of 1812), to give an unbiased review. He dwells on all of the negative things Napoleon did, leaves out,(from what I have read elsewhere) crucial information, and for the most part, ignores all of the improvements Napoleon made in France and his empire such as school, canals, emancipation the Jews etc. It also seems to me, for some completely unknown reason, Schom thinks Napoleon was lucky everytime he won a battle.I give Schom 2 stars because it taught me a lot about Napoleon and is relatively easy to read. However, if you want an unbiased book I would look elsewhere. I am."
2,Unbalanced and unedifying,"I came to this book prepared to enjoy it both because of Schom's writing style and because I am not a fan of Napoleon, sharing Schom's opinion that he was a crazy little psychopath. Nevertheless, I was quite disappointed in this book. It's not just that Schom is so very hostile to Napoleon; it's that he finds absolutely NOTHING redeeming but nevertheless makes no attempt to explain why, if this is so, Napoleon could accomplish what he did. Schom merely announces events without any analysis of why.I would not have been disappointed if Schom had given us a simple narrative history and left the analysis to the reader. I similarly would not be disappointed in a hostile attack on the emperor if I hadn't been left with the clear perception that there MUST be much that is missing. Schom can't have it both ways."
5,Brilliant,"This is a brilliant biography that deflates Napoleon's undeserved heroic status, and paints him as the power-hungry sociopath that he was. Napoleon lovers don't like this book, to the point that a book-signing of the author's in Paris was canceled, because a Napoleon Society interfered so it wouldn't happen. That's censorship that Napoleon himself would have approved of (since he censored the press when he was in power). And Naploeon fans in France tried to prevent Schom from accessing the more damning info about Napoleon. But, to Schom's credit, he forged ahead, so that we have a true picture of Napoleon's nature. (Oh, we have the Napoleonic Code...Well, that's like the joke made that under Mussollini, the Italian trains ran on time. Not a fair trade off for despotism!) This book is fascinating, and if you read one Napoleon bio, let this be the one."
5,Very complete,"This book hails as one of the most complete and inclusive accounts of one of the most psychotic dictators of our millennia. There is much I admire about Napoleon, especially during his early years. He came from relative poverty and endured the abuse by his peers. His work ethic and connections, combined with the changes of the Revolution, brought him to a level of success very early in his career. Unfortunately, he was quite delusional as well and this lead to his destruction. A very good read and fascinating to hear the real-life circumstances which bring this often portrayed 2D figure to life!"
2,Napoleon the bungler,"This book presents a novel and entirely frustrating view of Napoleon as a bumbling incompetent who barely knew one end of a cannon from the other. Despite his claims to ""balance"", Alan Schom's contempt for the French Emperor seethes through every hastily-written and poorly-edited page. Schom is probably right in his assessment of Napoleon as a self-aggrandising power monger, but portraying him as an egregious bungler stretches the reader's patience and credulity from the outset. It also signally fails to explain how this lowly Corsican gunnery lieutenant came to rule half of Europe before his mid-30s. As such, it is an unsatisfying read, ignoring the two most fascinating questions about Napoleon for the general reader - what drove him, and how did he do it? Buy it if you feel like wading through 800 pages of dispiriting vitriol."
2,MR. SCHOM HAS RE-WRITTEN HISTORY!!!!!,"Well, this ""jewel"" kind of reminds me of another ""factual"" book written by Albert GOLDMAN titled ""The Lives of John Lennon"". Mr. SCHOM seems to be bent on discrediting everything Napoleon said, did, or touched. Boy, I hope I start screwing up and stepping on it overseas here in Germany. I may have a chance to conquer all of Europe!!! Mr. SCHOM should have spent less time on trivial mumbo-jumbo and spent more time on researching the facts. I must admit that I couldn't put this book down because It was actually wonderful entertainment. Napoleon wasn't an angel, but he sure did alot more for France than Mr. SCHOM gives him credit for. Good cannon fodder."
2,"Not bad, but not good","This books is very easy to read but is extremely long. It portrays Napoleon more as a bumbling lucky idiot than a master war general. Goes into detail of the culture and history of the French government before, during and after him."
2,Made in China,I had high hopes for a small utilitarian Camillus. The knife IS functional...cute even.It has the bead blasted blade and FAST opening. It's low points are: 1. The blade is loose on the hinge laterally.2. overall not very sharp compared to other Camillus products. 3. Is it a Camillus? It is marked CAMCO--- CHINA on the blade. That info is not in the description.Two stars only because it functions. I kept it only because I needed a knife at the time
4,I loved it,"I just looked up this book to find out the author's name so I could find another one by her. I read this book a year ago, but it stays with me. I could not put it down. She not only painted a picture of Luz, but the world around her. I could see the house, hear the clink of the dishes, smell the flowers. Dailey opened up a world wholly unfamiliar to me, yet I related to Luz on a very personal level. It was brilliant. I can't wait to read another book by Dailey."
2,It's a waste of money,Too much effort for the results. I don't use it any more. Much simpler (free) ways to get the same results.
5,Well worth it!,"I picked up this DVD to play on my big-screen for a Pimps & Hoes Party I had for New Year. Everyone got a kick out of it and it really is entertaining to watch. The dancing is very sensual, but ambiguous enough that it can fit in with almost any party music so feel free to play your own track."
2,TOO LONG!,"This is a very interesting idea, but good for 4 minutes, not 1 hour and 4 minutes. Same girls, same moves, same irritating music not good for dancing and not good for a sexy atmosphere."
4,Haunting and thematic,"The main theme is very reminiscent of Michael Nyman's ""Memorial"" from the gastro-visual movie, The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover.2046 is very typical of French-scored soundtracks. The added feature is Angela Gheorghiu's rendition of the bel canto classic (originally by Maria Callas) of Casta Diva, featured in Norma opera.I found the remainder of the songs on this soundtrack evokative and emotional."
5,"GREAT SONGS, rhumba, latin stuff etc..",I don't know much about that type of music but it's SO EXCELLENT!
2,Dissapointing,"I loved the first in the 'On the Road' Series, the entry by Ti Jean, and when the second was published I didn't hesitate in buying it. I was gravely dissapointed. It lacked the spontaneity of Ti Jean's for a start. The only redeeming feature was the recurring character, Remi, who Doyon captured perfectly. I seriously wouldn't bother with this one."
5,Excellent,"This writer has many writings available that are not all listed in Amazon. Other writings of hers give a history of herself as a youngster, into her teens and young womanhood in America, how she came to live in Pakistan and how she embraced Islam in spite of the rejections and barriers she ran into on her Path to Allah. One is called ""At Home In Pakistan"" and another is called ""Memoirs of Childhood and Youth in America"". Both are excellent reads.Although I have most of this writer's books I enjoyed this one that is described in this review page. This book is also an excellent read. Her books are easy to understand and gives you a unique feeling that she is speaking to you firsthand.I would highly recommend it to anyone, be they Muslim or not."
2,Shams that match the size of your bed would help.,"I recieved my king size quilt today but was very dissapointed to see that the shams are made for standard pillows. Now I have to decide do I stuff a pair of king size pillows in them, get a pair of standard pillows for them or send the whole thing back."
3,More than a little disappointed....,"I'm usually very impressed by the books that Bruno Gmunder publishes, but this one is the exception. A few of the photos are quite beautiful, but most of them are lacking feeling -- they're just perfect bodies standing there, and often not even well-lit. Where the work of Steven Underhill, Howard Roffman and Jeff Palmer evokes something in me, this book doesn't move me at all. The print quality is also not quite up to par; many of the color pictures look like they were printed on an inkjet printer, because you can see all the little dots that went into making up the image.Before you buy this one, I'd really recommend browsing through it at your local bookstore to make sure it's what you want. ""Artistic nudes"" doesn't quite describe it, because they're just plain ol' nudes."
5,A definate must get for fans!,"There is four great things that happen in this movie:1. The scouts know Uranus and Neptune's true identities { But THEY know that Serena is Sailor Moon}!2. Sailor Pluto reappears.3. We find out who has the pure hearts.4. Sailor Moon gets the Purity Chalice/ Holy Grail.In the first episode:Mina is jealous that the Heart snatchers haven't targeted her yet, but she may get her wish.In the second episode:Amara and Michelle go to the Marine Cathdrel, where they meet the holder of the pure hearts.In the third episode:The three tailismans join to make the Purity Chalice/ Holy Grail.I advise all Moonie fans {if you haven't got this moive yet} to get it off of this site when it's back in stock, or off of another that has it in stock if you can't wait."
5,The best review for the best movie,"I really wanted to see this movie sense i was 5 wich is wheni started watching sailor moon. If I could give over five starz on this review i would! I would give this movie 5,000 stars!"
1,Not what we hoped for,"I bought these for my 6 year old daughter for Christmas. Since there weren't any other reviews, I wasn't sure how good these would be. If you are buying these for ""pretend play"", then they are okay. However, if you are buying these as actual walkie talkies (like I intended), then they do not work properly. You have to be within about 25 feet of one another to hear the morse code work. If you are any distance further than 25 feet, then you cannot hear anything at all. As for actually hearing any speaking, forget it! If you breathe into the speaker, you can hear that, but actual speaking does not work at all. I'm very disappointed with this product and I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Useless!,"I wouldn't waste your money. These have no reception, the volume is non-existent, if you can hear anything over the static. spend just a few dollars more and get real ones from the outdoor store. My daughters were so upset that they couldn't even use them. Don't buy these is my only advice!"
1,sham,Walkie Talkie a complete waste of money. I waited a long time for delivery and was very disapointed. Not worth the money!
1,terrible,"my kids got this for christmas and they do not work at all.they can pretend to talk to each other but that is about it.if ""zero stars"" was an option i would choose that"
2,monk spade,I was a little disappointed. I was expecting something made with a little better quality metal. Luckilyy son loved it
5,What's Old is New Again,"What a delightful surprise to find and enjoy these two Helen Reddy albums, re-issued by Raven on one CD. I was very fond of Helen's work in the 70s but only recently became a bona fide fan, digging into the titles of the old catalog still available. The hits and favorites are here: You and Me Against the World, Keep on Singing, Emotion, Angie Baby (a hit but not necessarily a favorite, for me). And so are gems previously unknown to me: I'll Be Your Audience, Pretty, Pretty and the gorgeous Stella by Starlight. These albums were well orchestrated and produced originally and have been meticulously remastered for reissue. A wonderful addition to your music collection if you appreciate fine adult contemporary music."
1,TERRIBLE AND FACTUALLY INCORRECT!,"In pursuit of factually correct accounts of our western history? Stay away from this poorly executed, and factually dishonest DVD. There is absolutely nothing burned on this disc that is correct or well done! Waste of time and money!!!"
4,wristband,grandson loves it. Made a hit with him. He would like more to choose from. You need too many words
5,"Josh Adams from Morgan,City l.a.",It was the coolest wrestling video I have ever seen. He is one of my favorite wrestlers.
1,What a waste of money. This tape stinks,"This tape has no footage of kevins first days in the WCW as OZ,Vinnie vegas or master blaster steele.It is exactly like the NWO tape which I might add stunk too!There is no difference in either tape its both the same.It deserves no stars but the lowest rating you had was 1 star."
4,Not a Real Nash Bio,"I would give this video 5 stars if its topic was nWo history as this tape mainly has nothing to do with nash, only events, its not a biography like for stone cold or y2j anyways heres the rundown:(ps theyre all clips)Nash introGreat amercain bash 96' (where outsiders beat up bischoff)Bash at the Beach 96(third man mystery)Halloween Havoc 96'(Outsiders v.

4,"If you love Big Sexy, you have to have this vid.","If you're a Kevin Nash fan, this is the tape for you. You find out how funny he can be and get to see highlights of some of the great matches since 96. I would rather have seen more of the interview with Big Sexy rather than hearing the other wrestlers talk about him. But anything that lets me look at this gorgeous man for 60 minutes makes me happy."
3,doesnt burn,"its costly if you outside the u.s the only up suide for myself was that it didnt burn bad like i usually get... i dont thing its a revlon relaxer cos iv used revlon before and the difference is night and day,,, and i never see any revlon logos on any of the product or packaging so doubt it is a revlon product..."
4,fabulaxer,"I am sorry to use this link for my problem but when I placed the order it was for 5 boxes of Fabulaxer e that is what they charge me for on my credicard: $25.29 for 5 boxes of Fabulaxer on January 04, 2009. For some reason I only got at my door 2 boxes of Fabulaxer. Since then I've been trying with Amazon.com to get this straight but they keep sending me to a link that doens't follow the procedures to reach the company that sells Fabulaxer. I end up paying for 5 and received only 2 and I don't have any suport of any one to help me solve this problem, but the money is already in their bank account. Iwould appreciate if someone takes responsability and call me (252) 364-0108 or e-mail me tryndade1@msn.comI'll be waiting to hear from any of you.Thank you,Selma Braga"
1,Oh please!!!!,"This book really took a beating in the translation from Japanese to English. There is so much needless repetition in it, that it is unbelievable! It was very difficult to tie anything in it to the works of Carlos Casteneda. Can't believe I read the whole thing!"
2,Noble effort that falls flat,"I went into to reading this book with an open mind, and was disappointed. The writer could have easily used this medium for more than self promotion. While I sympathize with her about her obvious problems with critics it detracts horribly from the work itself. There were very thoughtful sections of the book that were highly thought provoking but they were few and far between. Sorry if this offends the author, (as it will surely disturb ""Little Self"") but I am your audience and my opinion does matter."
5,Thank You Classic Media!!,"To have this film on DVD is AMAZING! I owned a 16mm print of this title years ago, and it was well used. This is a hard title to find. In fact, it hasn't been available in a TV package since the 1960's. Classic Media should be thanked by serious film collectors for bringing this classic out of the vault. The elements used seem to be from 35mm pre print, and are un-restored. However, the fact that any original print material exists on this title is a blessing."
2,to focused on pro side of bodybuilding,"the book contained good exercises, but all are available in any book or from anyone in a gym you ask, the routines were to complicated and not enough attention paid to them, escpecially for beginners or intermediates, the book focused to much on bodybuilding for pro's. if your a beginner or intermediate bodybuilder find a better book you'll only be disapointed with this, especially since the author spends a large proportion of the time talking about previous or current bodybuilders, i didnt buy the book to read about other people, the nutrition section is also useless.....i recommend one of arnies books"
5,Sterling Silver Bracelet,I love it and highly recommend - especially for the price. I like the weight of it and plus it is nickel free. I'm definitely going to purchase more jewelry from this company.
1,Change of Life,This movie was not what I expected. Difficult to follow and far to much wasted film time on the protestors....
4,Wonderful Early Australia novel,This is part of the Gubby family saga - a wonderful story by an outstanding Australian author of early Australia days. I loved it and recommend all of E V Timms work - truly a treasure writer of Australia!
2,Tank Girls,"Nudity with Military vehiclesBasically, take a few nice looking ladies, pay them to lounge over some restored vehicles without clothing, shoot photo's and publish a book.Content is only for those that like seeing naked women shoot machinegun type photos. There are some nice ""Details"" in the shots when you look past the foreground subjects at the vehicles themselves, but that's not the authors intention anyway.Oh well, from appearances, the collection would have been a nice detailing of the vehicles, but taste, etc...."
3,Ok,"Those hot girls don't make me overlook details of the tanks. It is fun for adult to "" watch "" this book."
1,a once over lightly of many topics not for knowledgeable dba,"For lightweight or beginning oracle dba's this book may be useful. It is way too ambitious in what it attempts to cover and is not suitable for anyone that has much of a clue already what is going on in oracle.Particularly pathetic is the over reliance of the author in testing performance of an application he apparently patched together, running on a pentium II windows machine with 128 meg of ram. Unfortunately he bases all his testing results of this machine. A semi decent sun or hp workstation can be had for under 1000 dollars ... even a more recent intel box running linux with a reasonable amount of memory would be a much better basis."
2,underwhelmed,"I am sure this guy knows his stuff, but it sure didn't come through very clearly. I would recommend a re-write with a new editor. There didn't seem to be a smooth transistion from introduction to the deep dive. Examples are explanations of checkpoint and latches.By the way, the Index was horrible.Maybe it is because he came from a dev environment as opposed to systems viewpoint. Anyway, not impressed with the overall presentation, which is a shame because it looks like he has paid his dues and has something to contribute."
3,put in trunk,"Never know when you'll need some simple tools when you're out and about. I keep some screwdrivers, etc in my trunk and I really needed some wrenches. Glad I got these...will give me peace of mind"
5,christmas gift,"Received tupperware super crisp it in great condition and in a timely manner. I bought it as a gift for my sister who had bought one over 30 years ago. It was a product that she loved but after several moves, it was misplaced. Now she has this fine product once again. Thanks"
2,Poor fitting Lid,Lid did not fit properly. I am using lid from my old Super Crisp it for Lettuce Keeper; it fits the new bowl.
5,Tupperware improvement,I have had the original tupperware lettuce crisper for over 35 years. Over time the lid warped beyone hope. I bought the new and bigger crisper and it's much better. It is bigger all around and even the lid had a large dome that better accommodates large heads of lettuce. Thye lid fits very snugly too. I like it a lot.
2,"Good ideas, but shoot the editor","McKenna's world is quite interesting, and the story itself was good. Her writing was simply awful, though. I couldn't read it for more than 15-20 minutes at a time -- I got a headache trying to muddle through it.I'm amazed this book was published in the shape it's in. I don't believe there was actually an editor assigned to it."
5,This is a great book,"I have just finished reading ""The Thief's Gamble"" and I thought it was fantastic. The plot was immediately engaging and the main character, Livak, interesting. Many of the more popular fantasy novels have particularly weak female characters who tend to tag along after the action - generally they are included only as a love interest to a male hero and not as a character in their own right. Livak is a very capable hero and does not take on the more traditional role of women in fantasy. I found the magic system also easy to comprehend; McKenna never invents more abilities for her magicians to use to get out of increasingly near-catastrophic situations. This is on my top-twenty list of favourite books."
2,Amateurish at best,"Another fine example of one of my pet peeves when reading novels -- lazy or non-existent editing. I wish I had a dollar for every time (1) a character looked up (or down) and grinned (or frowned), (2) characters gathered in a circle, (3)adverbs were redundantly added (ran swiftly, hid cautiously, glared angrily, etc. etc.), (4) the word ""faint"" or ""faintly"" appeared, (5)a character moved or headed somewhere. There are many more examples of creative writing 101 errors in the novel, and they pulled met out of what promised to be a good story over and over again. I hope the writing became more polished as the series went on, but this, as written, doesn't motivate me to find out."
3,A summer read,This is a typical fantasy tale based in its own world with wizards and warriors and of course thieves. It's a pretty decent read telling the story of a female thief who gets involved in a wizard's business and ends up in an adventure that's not exactly like the stories tell them.It's a nice summer read and it was good enough to make me consider buying the next part. There's not too much deep involvement with the characters but the story itself it quite capturing. It's her first book so I guess it will get better from here on.If you just want an in-between read while waiting for your favourite author(s) to publish something new and (of course) like fantasy/adventure novels then this is a good pick.
2,Fine but ordinary,"This is an ok book, but it is nothing out of the ordinary. I found the characters somewhat flat and unappealing, and the concept solid but standard fare.There is so much repetition in fantasy today, in order to be worth reading a book needs to break some molds. THE THIEF's GAMBLE does not take many risks or do anything original, though it is not bad reading, it just isn't anything special."
4,"Not groundbreaking, but still a good read.","The only real complaint I have about this book is the beginning. Reading through, it seems like perhaps unedited unrevised versions of the first few chapters somehow ended up in the final printed version. The writing is painfully bad. I ended up sticking it out, and with no real transition, a little ways in the writing spontaniously evens out and becomes clear and respectable. From then on, it's not bad at all.The plot isn't particularly devious (though a thing or two happens that the reader doesn't necessarily expect), the characters aren't unique (though written with fair depth), and the ambiance and scenery are sufficiently crafted to make a good read.This isn't a read-in-one-sitting, best-thing-ever-to-grace-your-bookshelf novel, but it isn't nearly as bad as some of the reviews imply. It's easily worth the time and money (if you can make it past the first bit)."
1,WOW.,"I mean it, WOW. I love fantasy books, I love the genre so much, but this made me realize why people say that we're stupid and just wasting our time with poorly written swill. It sounded good, it really did, but the writing was bad to the point of, oh, the baby-sitter club books my little sister read when she was 8. Maybe the characters were well developed, maybe the plot was unique and fresh, problem was, I couldn't get there, the first chapter was that BAD. You want decent fantasy, go read Terry Pratchett or Janny Wurts, Raymond Feist, or David Eddings, Robin Hobb is good too. Don't waste your time with this."
2,"Excellent ideas, horrible writing","McKenna is quite creative and deserves recognition for developing an interesting world populated by interesting characters. That said, her grammar is so atrocious that I couldn't read more than four or five pages at a time without developing a headache. I find it hard to believe that this book was actually edited.If she can find a good editor for her next novel, I think McKenna will be an author to keep tabs on."
3,Interesting Fantasy in Bad Prose,"As far as fantasy novels go, this one has a pretty good plot and development of characters. But I must agree with previous reviewers that the grammatical mistakes littered throughout the book severely detract from my enjoyment of the book. Particularly distracting is the lack of commas separating the two clauses of compound sentences.I would buy the other books in the series, because I do like the main characters and because the plot is engaging, but I really hope that future books would be more carefully edited."
4,Pretty Good Book,"this is a good book, very invovling, very interesting. the author uses a different style than most others.. it's called first person narration. Livak, the main character, a thief who got caught up with a band of the Archmage's people tells the story from her point of view, which is that this is all very unfair. it's definatly a switch but it is really good. for reader's that like this book i would recommend Maggie Furey's Aurian trilogy."
5,Gritty witty & original,This was a very exciting book to read. It has a gritty reality to it and very interesting concepts in it to keep you occupied and keep the pages turning. A story told from a thiefs point of view and the contrast is shown how different priorities are from such a persons view point.
3,"Interesting, but forgettable","Like some of the other reviewers I found the plot and characters interesting. It was an enjoyable read. When I picked the book up about two weeks later (after I saw that the sequel was out), I couldn't remember whether I read it or not. Thumbing through I remembered that I forgot got it as soon as I read it and did not care what happened to the characters at all. I won't buy the sequel unless I find it at the thrift store for 35 cents. It was good to read while waiting for the latest of some of my favorite series to come out (Jordan, George R.R. Martin)"
5,Great Book. Wonderful beginning author.,"I was at the book store looking for the next book in the series I was reading, but it wasn't there. I happened to see this book and it's cover really got me interested. The art really made it look interesting and the sysnopsis was intriguing. I really needed to get something to read and it looked like a good bet. I am very impressed with it. The magic is original, new, and exciting. The story flows and you get pulled along with it. It is an excellent peice of work. (Just one thing-I hope that Livak starts to use aetheric magic more, she is capable of it and she should make more use of her ability)All in all, this is a wonderful book and is definitely worth buying."
2,Calling all commas,"I couldn't agree more with everyone who said this book is in dire need of better editing. It would appear that the publisher had a limited amount of commas and so had to spread them out, resulting in an astonishing number of run-on sentences. For that reason, or perhaps simply because it was boring, I couldn't bring myself to finish the first 100 pages of Thief's Gamble."
2,Some good techniques/illustrations,"This book is fairly basic and somewhat shorter than I had expected but has some helpful detail on technique and illustrations that were key in figuring out some stitches I was struggling with. Overall it's not earth-shattering but a nice addition to my knitting library. There are better resources out there, but I'm not opposed to having several resources to refer to."
5,Very Good book,I find myself wanting to knit a lot of stuff with the stitches learned through this book. I recomed it to new users.
3,Same as any other...,"This book didn't really add much to my repetoire of skills. You can find a lot of the information online, sometimes with animated demos. The Harmony Stitch Guides are a better value."
3,Starting out Tool Set,"Yes this toolbox has a wide variety of medium quality items, but if you drop the box or forget the proper way to close it, heaven help you.If you are starting out and need your first toolbox or simply want an extra one in the car for trips to un-handy friend's houses, it is a nice little all-purpose kit.This is not a gift for someone who drops lots of money in hardware stores or someone who is a brand hound."
3,Sailor Moon is Great Dubbed and Subbed!,I believe the voice actors of the English dubb would have been just as convincing as their Japanese counterparts if the North American version kept the story intact without the glaring issues you wouldn't tell a three year old about.(which I won't mention). They could have translated the story and still keep it suitable for younger audiences while the uncut version be available to the otaku ages 15 and older( to be more specific mature people).Terri Hawkes would have been a very convincing Usagi/Serena and Tracey Hoyt a very cute Chibiusa/Rini. Stephani Beard would have been an adorable Diana.I think the new voice actors stink. Lita is the only original actress. Mina's original voice actress would have been just as convincing. The show overall regardless of format is still cool. I recommend the sub version. Due to the bad voice acting. I urge the dub be an offering the for youngsters.
2,Not interesting,I purchased this magazine years ago. I liked it then. I was not impressed with this magazine this time. I am not sure if the magazine has changed or if it is me. I did not renew the subscription.
3,Month and a day but no magazine.,"Kind of hard to say if I like the publication if I was only to base that on having seen one yet to review. This subscription process is slow. In today's high tech market where we all know the publication's circulation folks get your subscription and your money long before they ship it is a sad remark on their ability to join the modern age. Is the magazine great for those who like it? Oh sure, it must be. Is the distribution processing of subscriptions and delivery of product even close to meeting the customer desire? In this case no. We go to Amazon in part because we can usually expect delivery within a couple days. Magazines in over a month is just not cool."
1,All about Music,"The reason I gave this one star is because the title was misleading. I assumed it concerned all gifts, but this book is about people in music. It should say that. It also does not say anything that I didn't already know. Anybody that had been walking with the Lord any amount of time should know this stuff."
2,Ok...I guess,"I realize this is a training weapon, so I was not expecting top quality, but still I was slightly disapointed at the quality of this item.The handle guard was loose upon opening the package. This is actually a major problem because the Kung Fu form I have for this weapon involves using the handle guard in such a way that it being loose interferes with the form. I fixed this by tying some rope right up against it on the lower side. It's fine now, but I should not have had to do that.Also, the blade is much ""floppier"" than expected. It is more akin to a broad sword than what you would expect in a more power based weapon like this.I also noticed the blade is not continuously solid metal all the way down the handle. The handle appears to be made of two layers of metal with an open space between them. I have never seen a sword where this is the case. It's an obvious ""money saving"" technique.I guess you get what you pay for, and for 50 dollars, you shouldn't expect much."
5,Essential,"Essential reading for Jim Crow scholars. Useful selected reading for courses in historical period, sociology, political science, voices of the South."
5,Family Feuds,"Absolutely, Positively I really didn't care for this title. The first two pages do not do this book justice. After you get bye those pages your hooked. This book is family fighting family with some very odd twists to it. The emotional tangle of Molly Abberwick and Dr. Harry Trevelyan is emotionally sensitive and extremely deep. I kept saying to myself after this chapter I would put it down till tomorrow. I couldn't put this book down and it was 3 AM when I finally put it away. You guessed right I had finished it. If you like her family feud books you will love this one, one of her best.This book has everything you want in a romance, emotional, mesmerizing, humor and true love, what more could you want? This is Jayne Ann Krentz at her best. I love these stories that contain family you feel like you truely belong. You make these families your family because there's a little bit of you in this family. Thank you Jayne for writing this book it is truely outstanding"
1,Bleh,"While I liked the main characters, the secondary characters were extremely annoying. Not only were they cutouts of past characters, but they were over the top and lacked charm."
4,One of More Original Efforts,Some of Krentz's books are remarkably similar. This one is more unique. The characters are interesting. It was one of the first Krentz novels I read and it is still a favorite.
1,"Alas, this abridged recording butchers the story","The original _Absolutely, Positively_ is one of my favorite earlier JAK books.Recently I received this abridged recording of _Absolutely, Positively_ as a gift. What a disappointment! This recording seriously ruins the development of the plot, the characters and the relationships making the story very flat indeed. This is a very awkward abridgment in which even the narrator sounds rushed. Wish my friend had saved her money.Please note I have many unabridged recordings of other JAK books which are very well done. Too bad this book was not recorded by the folks who did the others.If you enjoy older JAK stories you should enjoy this one in an UNABRIDGED printed edition. Harry and Molly are very endearing characters.I am going to dig out my old paperback of _Absolutely, Positively_ now and enjoy the story as it was written."
5,Kinkier than the Forum,"My husband and I love getting our monthly subscription. We read it to each other in the bath tub and get all hot and bothered. We often talk about the stories inside and discuss our interest in the fantasies we've read about. Variations has definitely led us to try a lot of fun things together.If you find yourself interested in trying some of the things you are reading about in this mag, check out Intense Games DVD, it is an adult party game that makes fantasies reality. Really."
5,Dear Penthouse...,"Penthouse Variations is a spin-off magazine of Penthouse that includes Reader's Letters, bondage or BDSM letters, reviews, etc. It also contain short pictorials and long stories about people who get tied up for a weekend or become willing sex slaves for there partner. Variations also have cover girls and will normally advertise sex toys and sex machines as well as the usual magic pill. Contents include S&M Letters, Wife Watching Letters, and Sex Toy Stories. Although many of the stories focus on couples, there are some that explore the thrill of the casual encounter. These wild and sensual stories have altered people's lives and will open your mind to the erotic possibilities that can exist."
2,Intended for beginners age 7+,The drills are good for beginners provided they are at least 7 years old. The book could have been improved with a section on getting and holding the attention of young children. The section on space was interesting for an adult to read but beyond the ability of a 5 year old to grasp.
1,:-(,"Sorry, but the book never teaches soccer techniques, the drills never become gamelike, and I can't imagine 10 year olds tolerating drills in this book for more than 5 minutes."
4,These shoes are hot!!!!,"I purchased this shoe in the pastel colors. I love them. I haven't worn them for a long period yet, therefore I can't say if they will be tremendously comfortable. But I will say they are very pretty and extremely sexy!!"
3,Your sun doesnt have to be fully above the horizon to light up someone else's life.,"This series stirred lots of things for me and was fascinating to hear the paths talked about so deeply. Huston Smith is wonderful and old and frail with deep innocence and wisdom. There are truly realized teachers and they are not here...they are talked about here, and are felt and honored here. So a listener sparked by these discussions can go further towards a master or path discussed here."
5,Track Listing!!!!,Morcheeba - let me see 2. the mavericks - dance the night away 3. steve curtis chapman - i will not go quietly 4. yngwie malnmsteen - facing the animal 5. chris knight - it ain't easy being me 6. sixpence non the richer - kiss me 7. gov't mule - blind man in the dark 8. lisa bigwood - livin on a budget 9. bill wyman and the rhythm kings - tobacco roads 10. marie brennan - the light on the hill
3,Save some money ...,In my humbled opinion the grease is perfect and easy to apply but I would not order the injector again ... a total waist of my cash.Fingers work very well thank you.
3,Recipes not all accurate,"I thought this book would be a good source of recipes. However, the crossiants were a disaster. Too much flour to too little butter. Much more success with Nick Malgieri's How to Bake recipe for crossiants, where the ratio of flour to butter makes more sense. Brioche came out ok with this book. It may be a classic, but that does not always mean success as newer books may provide better recipes from guru's such as Silverton, Levy and Malgieri."
4,Its not all baguettes.,"I found a ... paperback copy of the book and bought it primarily for the pictures of the many different shapes and types of bread in France. It is useful for that but has value for the many recipes included. I first tried the recipe for the Poilane boule. My effort was creditable, quite edible, and with a few hundred repetions may approach the original. There are many recipes for many breads from many regions of France. As a reference for the many possibilities it is excellent. While it is not the first book a novice to bread baking should acquire, it is an excellent one for someone whose interest in the subject has undergone at least the first fermentation."
5,"So Far, So Good... One of Many to Buy and Keep!","This book is one of many that I've purchased as I began making my own artisan breads. I like Bernard Clayton's writing style; he's friendly and informative, in addition to providing good recipes. I've found his measurements - in the 2002 edition - to be accurate and the directions easy to follow. The Pane Ordinaire on page 163 is the best French bread I've made so far. Okay, I incorporated techniques from Peter Reinhart and Rose Beranbaum, but the recipe and the majority of the techniques were Clayton's. I'd recommend this book as a must-have if you are building a bread-baking library."
5,Linda Knows Her Stuff!,"I am never going to take the MOS exams, so why do I need this book? Because I use Excel daily for any number of tasks and this book has shown me ways to do things I didn't realize were there. I have always known Excel is one powerful program, but Linda's book has made me realize it is a lot more powerful than I thought. There are no hard to follow scenarios, everything is so easy to understand the way Linda presents the material.I have taken several classroom classes for Excel and this book beats the classroom experience for me, hands down. I keep it handy as I never know what I will want to try next. I am learning more about Excel than I ever thought possible, as I used to think I already knew it all. Linda has shown me new ways to do tasks that just make them fun instead of tedious."
5,More than an MOS guide,"Although the book is a study guide for MOS, you don't have to be taking that exam(s) to benefit from this book. If you are intimidated by spreadsheets, and want to get started with a text book equivalent of your school books, this book fits the requirement.And of course, if you are a candidate for a MOS exam, then you'll love the book. I liked how it is laid out -- the exercises are ""real life"" and the scenarios are thoughful and well explained."
4,Surpasses expectations,"In searching for a book on MS Excel, I came across Linda's book, and was not only pleasantly surprised by the contents of the books, but by the authors' keen presentation of the material in a well written and very well organized manner. I did not read ""high tech computerese"", but rather, a book that was easy to understand and comprehend in terms every level of user would find beneficial.As an intermediate user of excel, this book will be a valuable contribution and resource on my desk. The step by step exercises allows one to understand the actions being undertaken and results that should be achieved by the user. This approach will allow the user to better understand the concepts and rational behind every action. I recommend this book with the knowledge that each and every user of the book will be enriched. Well done, Linda, a book to be proud of. To those who are seeking an excellent resource, whether a beginner or advanced, I would say ""buy it"" now!"
1,Disgruntled in New York,"The files themselves in this set are perfectly fine and probably servicable for light household or handyman use. The handles, however, are a complete and utter joke. They can't be firmly attached to the files, and couldn't possibly be used to hold the files for any kind of work. Fisher-Price has more useful tools."
4,good versatility,this set is very versatile. i also liked the variety of of the files that came with it.
4,An Entertaining... Textbook?,"The second in an informative and entertaining series on English history, this book is not a difficult read, even if it's required for class. An excellent overview of this time period for any student of English history- or the average reader. One of the few disappointments was the section in which Oliver Cromwell appeared. Absent was any mention of reasons why historians such as Maurice Ashley have labelled Cromwell as a ""brave, bad man"", or of the atrocities he instigated in Ireland. If your interest does not include the information on Cromwell, this is an excellent book, one I did not sell back after the semester was over!"
2,Nothing interesting here,"What can I say? I wasn't impressed by this so-called ""textbook."" It doesn't seem matter-of-fact enough to be an actual textbook, yet isn't interesting enough to be considered a decent historical work. There is surprisingly little detail about the events here depicted.I had to use this book for a class, but I found that I got about ten times more out of my instructor's lectures than this text. There really is very little to boast about here--it's basically just a mundane, watered-down history of England.I hate to say it, but I was disappointed. I haven't studied much of English history, but even my limited knowledge was enough to know that this book is but a scratch on the surface. If you have to have this for a class, there's not much you can do, but if you're looking for a good history of England, keep looking."
2,Too outdated for Rails 2.x,"The basics are great - if you were back in 2007 or so.Now in late 2008 and early 2009 the book is too obsolete. Most examples, starting almost from the first page, will not run under Rails 2.x, as the book was written with Rails 1.x in mind.Rails is a fast advancing technology, which makes some books quickly become obsolete. This is one of them.In short don't waste your money, and try instead something likeAdvanced Rails Recipes, which I just purchased, and which was written specifically for Rails 2.x"
4,Excellent set of RoR recipes,"I would give this book 5 stars, but I only give it 4 stars because there are some minor quirks in getting some recipes to work, possibly due to differences between rails/ruby at the time of publication and the state rails is in now?Anyway, it's minor things you can work your way through, but which nevertheless show the book's age."
1,One of the worst books ever written on this topic.,"Miller's total disregard for facts is only the first of many problems with this book. Disguised as a book about the history and teachings of the Baha'i religion, it is instead a twisted polemic against the faith. Rather than objecting to Baha'i teachings on theological grounds, Miller attacks the central figures of the religion with a duplicitous ferocity not dissimilar to the enemies of Jesus in the early days of Christianity. Anyone looking for factual information will do well to look elsewhere. Even the pictures and photographs are erroniously identified"
1,"The facts, please?","This book is a travesty of publishing. The photo id is inaccurate along with all of the information in the book. Mr. Miller has no regard for any factual information. The book is self-serving and bigoted. If one wants to find information about the Baha'i Faith, they are sure not to find it here."
1,"""See through thine own eyes...""","First of all, I must say, I have not read this book. However, I could immediately detect bias and incorrect information in the summary. When it comes to education about the Baha'i faith, Baha'is believe that for justice we are to study the writings of any religion ourself and make a decision about what we believe. To see the writings through the eyes of another is unfair and misleading. The highest education and the most widespread traveling does nothing to guarantee that a person has better-seeing spiritual eyes than you."
4,Long & Tall Shirt,"I love this shirt. I have 36 inch arms and it's difficult to find shirts that fit. When I tried it on I was amazed on how far it went down my body. The tail of the shirt easily goes down to my thighs and I don't have to worry about it coming out of my pants. The arms size fits well and doesn't ride up my arms. The shirt is durable and well constructed. Even though it's a western shirt I'm glad that it has regular buttons rather than snaps. The shirt is lined inside for additional durabilty and warmth. Over all this shirt is a bargain for $20.00. I can easily imagine this shirt going for $60, or more, retail. Shipping was lighting fast."
3,Not his best mystery,"I'm a fan of the Gideon Oliver series, but I didn't think this was one his better efforts. While I've never been able to solve one of his mysteries completely, when the clues are presented fairly I can often figure out at least part of the story. However in this case, I didn't think Elkins provided a reasonable opportunity to solve anything. Furthermore, the explanation of the mystery was unsatisfactory because it relied on some irrational behavior from one or more of the characters. The book does have some of the things that I like about the series, including the usual entertaining encounter with local law enforcement, but I didn't think the mystery was up to par this time."
3,There is hope for the future of modern music,"Just picked up this album off the recommendation of my friend Steve who lives in Seattle (where this band is from). This is not a Smith's tribute album, nor is this a throwback to the Seattle sound. It is a rather interesting and intoxicating blend of the vocal qualities of New Pornographers, and the RRIot Grrl sound of the early 90's.The music is definitely new and has a lot of energy. The vocals are simply awesome! Its kind of funny, the music store i got this album from had the album rated as ""hardcore/punk"" and I simply don't see it. The music is fast at times and edgy (especially some of the lyrics) but is very accessible to those who aren't afraid of some crashing guitars and a thrashing sound at times. Check it out if you want to hear ""whats next"" and remember that there are other bands out of Seattle who have this sound as well such as Sleater Kinney (sorry if i got the spelling wrong).Matador Records...does it again..."
2,Relegated to the opening band position,"The kind of indie band that tries to sound more experienced then they are, PGMG offer pop-punk (guided by second-rate female vocals) of a fragmented kind that usually feels like it is trying too hard to feel authentic when the language being used for songwriting is anything but."
2,Pass on this one,"I bought this CD cause of the price. It should be less considering the quality of the tracks. Mostly all of the songs are the same beat over and over again.. there's no varity. Don't get me wrong there are some alright songs, but overall this CD basically stinks big time. The one thing that I find hard to believe is this is a ""various artist"" CD that term can be used loosely, listen to some songs online or something and you'll know what i'm talking about."
5,"CRC Handbook of Chemistry & Physics, 85th edition","Excellent, classic reference work & source of a library of technical information & facts. Formerly (known by students 50+ yrs ago) as ""The Rubber Handbook"""
5,Great Book,This book is great to help those in need of its content.You'll need quiet time to read this book to yourself.
4,Very pleased with this product,My husband is very happy with these seatcovers. They fit well and are made of a durable fabric.
5,Excellent tutorial on how to make bent wood furniture.,"Kim Eltrond's video tape is an excellent tutorial for those craftpersons that want to learn how to make bent wood furniture. Kim discusses and illustrates all the necessary tools and techniques from gathering green wood to making two different projects: a plant stand and a settee.Although he uses and discusses woods native to his area (Canada), especially alder, I was able to substitute local Kentucky bendable green woods, inculding poplar, basswood, and of course, willow.I found Kim's script well written and organized for its intended purpose of teaching rustic furniture making. He offered several useful techniques that aren't apparent to beginners and that saved many hours of learning from my own mistakes. An instructional booklet is included that contains detailed materials lists for the two projects."
5,BEST PROBIOTIC i have tried so far!!,I have tried accuflora which has good reviews but they just didn't do anything for me. I felt like my body er...functions were the same on and off that. I also tried trader joe's probiotic...the more expensive capsules that are supposed to survive your stomach acid. They didn't work either. The pearls work the best and I can FOR SURE TELL if they are working. In fact the first couple days you use them...take care to not be too far from a toilet at any given time... Def gonna stick to these from now on. no more shopping around!
5,Set my digestion system right after antibiotics,I was having lots of stomach problems due to taking several rounds of heavy-duty antibiotics for a sinus infection. I had never had a problem with diarrhea before but I was reaching for Imodium 2 or 3 times a week. I had a friend recommend probiotics and I purchased these Pearls based on Amazon user recommendations. I am glad I did. The little round pills have caused no negative side effects and my problems have ceased. It only took a few days to notice a difference. I am going to continue to use these on a daily basis because they obviously benefit my digestive tract.
4,Good,"I bought these to see if it would help with my tummy troubles. Well, I didn't see any difference in that. But I took one everyday while on an antibiotic to save me from the dreaded YI. It did the job! So small and easy to take. I would buy again."
4,The cd is tight its about time pe got back in the game,"First of all the album is of the hook. Its nice to see some ogs still doin their thing. They have a deep message and alot of content, but i dont agree with them bring a deep message back to rap. i dont think it ever left. i understand what yall are talking about with juvi yes he is comercial and raps for the clubs. but what about talib, common, nas. i mean they never stoped rappin bout content. and if they arnt angry enough what about immortal technique, or dead prez. i mean that is about as political and as angry as u can get in rap and they never left. Bizzy just released a new cd that has alot of content and has that atitude to it. im not taking anything from pe but to say that they are doing something that isnt being said in rap is overlooking many many great mcs that are delivering powerful messages."
4,The Rebirth!!!,"This is that other part of Hip hop that needs to me heard. If we can force hoes, thugs, drugs and rims down the people throat, this should be given to the people also.The production is on point, Paris did his thing. Chuck D lyrics are so raw and real. Dead Prez make an appearance on a couple of tracks. Paris is on a lot of tracks which helps break the album pace from just hearing Chuck D. It does not have an old sound if that is what your first thoughts are because it is PE. I think Paris wrote some of Chuck's rhymes ut he delivers them so well it could fool you. PE needed an album like this to break their ""comfort zone"", and it worked. Hotep!"
4,"Album Is Dope!! If you like P.E., you will love dead prez music also. so check that out to!!","Like I said this is that real Hip Hop Music right here and if you like this be sure to check out dead prez music as they are as close to a group as PE in 2006. and if you in cali be sure to catch their first L.A. performance in 4 years as it will be hot!! May, 13 2006!! Straight From Chappelle's ""Block Party"" Dead Prez With Ras Kass, DJ Revolution Of Wake Up Show, KDAYS Icy Ice & More TBA.... 350 Pine Ave., The Vault 350...Long Beach, CA 90801....An Extremely Limited Amount Of Pre-Sale Tickets Available Now For On-Line Purchase @ www.thaformula.com & @ Your Local Record Shops"
3,You know what,"Hey Viper, I am going to take your advice and buy Juvenile's cd ""Reality Check."" But you know what? I'm gonna buy this one too, and I plan on enjoying both of them. Is that okay for one to like both Juvenile and Public Enemy? Is it possible in your book?You know, I hesitate to used this cliched word, but you truly got some haterism in you Viper. It's quite enough that you disrespect their legacy and all, if you don't like their music you don't like it, but why does it bother you that PE come out with a new cd? You must be hating pretty hard to know exactly when this cd came out and to post a hate review on the very first release day! Anyways, I will take your advice, and I hope you are at least right on that one..."
4,PE & Paris Keepin it really real!! Amen,"Sorry to the ""Juvenile lover"", but this is so far outta that league its on another planet. That ""juvenile"" stuff is as it implies for children. This album is like water for the thirsty. With all of hip hop today wandering so aimless and base. It is a rare and wondrous occurance when hip hop artists actually try to make something meaningful instead of the bling oriented misogynistic junk we are bombarded with daily by BET and MTV. Hats off to Chuck and Paris. Let the haters, hate and flee in the face of truth. No courage in hip hop save Chuck D and Paris."
3,It's a good book; not a great book.,"I read the earlier version of this book, ""Katie.com."" The book starts off slowly and I was getting bored with it for a while. I just couldn't relate to this teenage girl from an upper middle class family. In my opinion, she was too obsessed with designer clothes and with her swimming team. The book eventually gained my interest when she started talking to a guy that she met online who was going by the name of Mark. Their relationship and the legal case that followed are the only things that piqued my interest. I'm glad that I read the entire story, but I'm very glad that I spent so little to buy it. This book is well worth the few bucks that I payed for it. I found it to be very mild. I do recommend it--even for other teens."
3,Not to bad,"The story, at times, drags on but you want to keep reading it just incase something happens. Its a book yous should read if you have alot of time on your hands."
3,Two Fathers,"Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent is the third entry in the Two Fathers series of TV movies, starring Robert Conrad and George Hamilton. The plot line involves the two fathers pursuing an escaped prisoner who had killed their children. This is average TV movie fare, nothing special. The DVD print was fine."
2,Weak Plastic,"It's a good thought, but needs redesigned. Broke the first time I used it. The plastic tip that hold the metal shaft to the snow plow snapped in half."
5,A great book from Harry Elmer Barnes.,The most complete summary of the controversy over the causes of WWI.A total debunking of the myth of German responsability for the war and a ruthless exposure of the disgraceful complicity of America's establishment historians in the jingoism and German hating that lead to Versailles and the decades of misery and injustice that followed.A must read for anyone interested in the causes of WWI.
5,Powerful Literature,"Dr. Franklin visited Howard University earlier this month. He gave a powerful lecture; however, his lecture was not nearly as powerful as his book."
2,Recipes Are OK,"I've given this book a try in the past. I was not that impressed. The food itself did not have a great flavor even though it smelled wonderful as it was cooking all day. I would give another cookbook a shot before buying this one. If you still feel inclined to give it a try, I would borrow a copy."
3,Betty Crocker's Slow Cooker Cookbook,Most of the recipes have numberous ingredients that increase the time of food preperation and negates the purpose of using a slow cooker to have simple meals.
4,Very Good recipes,"I've tried most of the Meat recipes and have liked them all. Some could have the spices upped a little bit for more zing. I just wish it had more main course recipes. I'm really not interested in dessert, soups and miscellaneous. I'm disappointed that the recipes don't indicate the approximate number of servings."
5,You can't go wrong with Betty,"For good, basic information about any cooking technique or food group, Betty Crocker is one of the best resources. You can count on clear, concise directions, excellent photos of the finished dish, and a wide range of dishes. This book is no exception. Whether you're new to slow cookers or an old hand, there will be something here that will make you want to fire up the crock pot and get cooking."
5,Begin to Love Cooking Again!,"This cookbook has inspired me to try different foods and cook homemade dinners more often! We've made more than a dozen of the recipes and only disliked one (which my neighbor loved!). We regularly entertain and I use many of these recipes for guests. In fact, I've already had one ask me where to get this book! Wonderful!"
2,Not up to par with other Betty Crocker books,"I wanted to love this cookbook. I swear by the regular Betty Crocker cookbook, and figured I couldn't go wrong with this one. I have made several recipes out of it, at least 5 but probably more. They turn out OK, but I haven't made any of them again. Out of what I've tried, the best has been the chili, but you can get a chili recipe anywhere. It really doesn't have that many recipes either. I would recommend the ""Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker"" cookbook over this - it has a ton more recipes and all the ones I have tried have been extremely tasty."
5,Great Cookbook,"The recipes are just what I was looking for and the first chapter with tips on using a slow cooker successfully is outstanding. I have tried several recipes already and they turned out perfectly. A ring binder format would have been better, but other than that I can highly recommend this cookbook."
3,Book is not as large as it looks,The book is a spiral but it is a very small spiral notebook. I was expecting a larger book for the price.
1,Garage Sale Leftovers,"The item I ordered was marked new. What I received had a $1.00 garage sale sticker on the cover, stains on the back cover as well as stains and bits stuck to the inside pages. Not what I consider ""new""."
2,Not impressed...,"I went through this cookbook after going through the new Southern Living Slow Cooker Cookbook and what a disappointment! Not only does this book use many pre-packaged items (if I'm making it myself, I'd rather not use that junk), the recipes were dull. Almost every recipe was in the other cookbook and was MUCH better. I also purchased the More Betty Crocker Slow Cooker Recipes and MANY of the recipes were the same--picture and all! What a waste of money. Purchase the new Southern Living Slow Cooker cookbook and you'll be MUCH happier!"
3,Very similar to Pillsbury's!,"Although this is a fine cookbook, my wife and I were startled to find that many of the recipes contained here are identical or very similar to ones contained in ""Pillsbury Doughboy Slow Cooker Recipes"" book. Even some of the pictures are identical.Our advice: buy one or the other, but not both!"
3,check it out at the library first,"The recipes are mediocre. It's too old-fashioned for me. I don't like the ""throw a can of condensed soup in"" kind of cooking.I really prefer either ""Good Housekeeping""s slow cooker cookbook or ""Slow Cookers for Dummies"""
5,Great Book!,"I have enjoyed this book tremendously. The recipes are not the ""add a can of soup"" variety."
4,Betty Crocker's Slow Cooker Cookbook,"This cookbook was a Christmas gift for my wife who, some weeks before, told me she wanted to use the slow cooker for more than the occasional stew. Now she probably will. Oh happy days ..."
1,Not Worth Purchasing....,I found the recipes in this book to be simple and bland. I am actually in the process of returning the book. Anyone who cooks can come up with combinations better than this.
4,Basic slow cooker cookbook,"Received a slow cooker as a gift - wanted to learn how to use it. This cookbook provided the information I needed to start using. Fantastic recipes, information on coverting your own recipes, recipes everyone will love - this is an easy book to use - it's spiral bound so it lays flat on the counter. I highly recommend!"
3,A Mixed Impression,"I bought this book because of the large chapter on ""One Pot Meals"". However, these turned out to be mostly soups. Many other recipes had just too many steps to prepare. There are some good and reasonably simple recipes as well."
3,cook book,"the book was used, and some of the pages were quite wrinkled. Other than that, it was ok. I gave it as a gift and the recipient was happy with it. She knew that it was a used book and was ok with that."
2,Not at all happy.,"When I got this book, I realized there was no reason for it to be listed in ""good"" condition. There is no way I can give this to the person I bought it for. The book is filthy, the corners of the cover are torn off, and they sent it to me with post it notes still stuck to a bunch of pages. I always thought going with used books was the way to go because it was through Amazon, but I am done with it now."
2,Upset,"This item was discounted when I purchased it and seemed to be what I was looking for. When it arrived I was surprized that it was only tacked stitched and not ""box stitched"" as the description implied. The down coverage is uneven and over time will shift because of the openness of the construction. Not a good deal when the local store white sale prices are considered."
5,I love my new down comforter.,"I recently purchased this down comforter and just love it. It's the perfect weight. I'm usually always cold and my husband is always warm. But this comforter seems to meet both our needs, it's great. Plus, I have many allergies and this comforter is hypo-allergenic."
3,"It's warm, despite large patches that have no down feathers","As I cast this comforter out and over my bed I noticed large ""patches"" where down feathers had mostly gathered and large areas where there were no feathers at all.How do you go about trying to more evenly distribute the feathers??"
2,Very Disappointed,"I just received this comforter about an hour ago. It looked like it had been used and returned because the the pouch that holds the comforter is open, wrinkled, and had no label. The comforter is not in much better shape. It is also wrinkled, and there is a hole (due to incomplete stitching) where the label is. I just finished stitching it up so the stuff inside won't come out. I am hitting myself on the head right now for buying this thing. I could have bought something better for little more at Costco but didn't. Stupid me. I am through with Amazon."
5,"Traditional, and built like a rock!","I was very impressed with this kwan dao. Ive held many others and this one has to be the best quality ive come across so far. I do recomend that if you are planning on using this for practice, that you should work very hard on developing your upper body strength because this sucker is heavy! It weighs about 14 lbs and unlike most kwan dao's out there, the shaft is made of solid metal! Originaly, these babies would have weighed somewhere between 50 - 100 lbs! But now people tend to shy away from that and prefer wushu steel. If you are looking for your first kwan dao, I would probably recommend that you buy either the dragon head kwan dao (8 lbs) or the wushu steel (4 lbs) from martial arts mart. But if youve got the brawn then I say go for it!"
3,Not what I expected,"The Overall quality is ok. However the joint between the blade and the shaft(rod thing) of the kwan dao is not very solid. It uses a very small welding cord in the middle. The plate and the blade are not weld together which adds to the same problem. This causes the weapon's blade to tremble a little bit on mid swing and It doesn't provide me with much confidence (I am only a manufacturing engineer, this may be per design and completely acceptable for its intended use). That said, It has not broken yet and no cracks are visible, also it has perform very well in the couple of times where it was used for an exhibition."
3,Gentleman Jim,"Wonderfully written saga of Admiral James Russell,who was one of the longest serving officers in the United States Navy. The chronology of Russell's service to his country is well-told but lacks the picture of the man as a whole person. It would have been good for the reader to hear of his wonderful sense of humor, the stories of his early days as a Naval aviator along with Spic Weid, Dan Gallery, and Bill Halsey. The book is great as far as it goes. It simply needs a sequel. How about it?"
5,Absolutely Marvelous Writing!,"""Katherine: Heart of Freedom"" is one of the best books I have ever read. It is the only one in the series I've read so far, but I'm going to get the others as soon as I can! I'm not going to write anything about ""Katherine"" - except to say that it's great- because if I do, I know I'll spoil the ending! I recomend this book to anyone! Happy reading!!"
5,Great book!,"This is a great book! Katherine goes against her mother to help save a patriot - then realizes she loves him, and that she is a patriot, too. Hearts and Dreams is a cool new series. Charlotte was good, too. I can't wait for Carrie and Stephanie!"
1,An unfortunate waste of money,"I bought this book because I thought it'd be fun and interesting, but I was wrong. There were many tests which were interesting and I didn't mind taking the time to answer the forty to sixty questions. What bothered me was when I finished answering all the questions I was left completely confused. I'd find out my score for a test, but it didn't tell me if my score was a good thing or a bad thing. Instead it showed the results of other people, which I really didn't care about. I only wanted to know about my score, which I didn't get. I hope others were able to find this book helpful because I sure didn't."
3,The first one was better!,"I had bought the first book Louis Janda wrote in the personality test series: 'The Psychologist's Book of Self-Tests : 25 Love, Sex, Intelligence, Career, and Personality Tests...' and I think it was better. First of all I like the different tests in THIS book, they are pretty introspective. But I DID NOT like the way the tests were scored. It was at times hard to understand and keep tract of. I wanted to take the tests and learn the answer about myself. But even when I half figured out the scoring system and added the numbers up I couldn't tell by the scoring system whether my having a high/low score was good, or bad! I only give this a ""3"" instead of a ""2"" because they tests themselves were good, and pretty easy to take. Otherwise, if you're real good at math and have plenty of patience, you'll REALLY love this book."
4,Matmos - The Civil War,"THE CIVIL WAR is another fascinating concept album from Matmos, this time entwining American Civil War-era instruments and melodies with modern electronica. Well, maybe not ""entwining"" as simply crashing the two into one another headfirst. Tracks like ""Zealous Order of Candied Knights"" show their eagerness for experimentation -- and their playful humor. ""Reconstruction"" is straight-up weirdo house that gives way to a strum-and-twang-fest. ""For the Trees"" is all folk mellowness, surprisingly light on the electronics, while the marching band standby ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" gets semi-obliterated by drum riffs. As with all experiments, though, some fail: the bass-heavy ""Pelt and Holler"" seems misplaced here, and ""Yield to Total Elation"" lacks focus. But ""The Struggle Against Unreality"" brings things back, as does the reprise of ""For the Trees."" Still, it's better to move forward than lean back on your laurels, and Matmos does just that -- even if they go back in time to do it."
3,Sturdy flimsiness,"One of the more creative forces in electronic idm willing to forget what the genre should and shouldn't entail, Matmos nonetheless can easily get mired in thematic cheekiness which derails a lot of his work from moving past eccentric distraction to captivating composition."
2,What's the point?,I had to use this book for my college linguistics class and it was pretty useless. There really isn't any information in the book that isn't common sense if you just think about it.
4,language matters,"Took a while to come, but came in the the time frame given. Came in great condition and was exactly what I was looking for. Came in better condition than I expected."
5,Very good,"Dear Sirs,This book is excellent sourse for those who never visited the countries where nomads of Niger are living. Of course, if it is interesting for you. Splendid photos of different tribes and people. Very good and understandable texts. I enjoyed the jorney when I have read the book. When you read it and look on the photos you feel like you are there, among nomads.It is also very good for people who are going to visit the countries where the Niger nomads live. You have to read this book before you trip.Sincerely yours,Vladyslav."
4,light hearted goodness from the folks that brought you S.E.,"adorable, well crafted characters with kooky allusions to lain; Mayuko stands in the same place on the bus as lain. The aliens are even lovable, especial the attenna-less name-sake of the show, NieA. The other aliens have attenna, that's what makes her ""under 7"". Domestic poor animation is the coolest phrase i've heard in a long while. Savor the taste of India and the more earthly aliens, soo choice!!"
4,"Not Great, but quite good","When I first watched this anime, I was rather put off by it. I guess the wacky humor and sudden moments of seriousness had me a little whiplashed. However, after watching this thing about 4 times (very odd for me) it has clawed its way up to the 4 star level, which is pretty good.I think the plot line is a little hackneyed and some of the jokes don't work for an out of the loop gaijin like myself. Still, it really is a fun and interesting anime, and well worth checking out for anyone who marches to the beat of a slightly different drummer."
2,"Good idea, but not optimally done","This book isn't bad, but neither does it reach its mark. My biggest complaint with it is that it is filled with hundreds of isolated and nonsensical ""hello, world"" type of examples. Readers would have been better served with practical examples, especially ones chained together (i.e., exercises that build on previous ones).Also, for some odd reason the fairly straightforward concept of arrays isn't covered until mid-book. As a result the first half of the book contains many gloss-overs like ""it'd be cool to show you this nifty feature using arrays, but we won't discuss them until a later chapter.""Also conspicuously absent was a summary chapter at the end that brought together most of the ideas on the book, in a nifty sample application.That said, of the 600 pages in this book, about 200 or so serve as useful references. Perhaps you'd be better off buying a reference book though."
4,"Good ""Classroom"" Type of Book...","For someone, like myself, who had just started learning JavaScript, this book was an excellent foundation...Even though, a couple of the introductory chapters (e.g. chapter on functions) use some REALLY ridiculously long examples/methods to achieve a simple task as writing text into the <body> section of the page or popping up a message window; Pollock does, however, eventually put them into ""real-world"" use in the later chapters...If you can overcome some of these few &#65533;what-duh&#65533; chapters, this book will be your top tool to getting started scripting like a pro&#65533;"
4,elegiac Marguerite Duras film,"One warning: this edition is Region 1 (US/Canada standard) but it is in French with no subtitles. That said, it's a lovely, rather modest film which attempts to depict a woman's loneliness. In most of the film, Vera Baxter is sitting in a room, where her ruminations (which often take the form of a conversation with an unnamed woman) convey a sense of her isolation.It is hard to explain Duras's methodoloy, how she is able to make the tentative emotions of a woman seem so piercing and profound. This was her method in her novels, and as a filmmaker she was often able to find the perfect sound-image combination to convey her themes. BAXTER VERA BAXTER isn't one of her masterpieces (the lead actress is somehow less than overwhelming, a problem also found in Duras's earlier film DESTROY SHE SAID), but it is a very beautiful film nevertheless."
5,Nice looking and comfortable shoes.,"Since I have foot problems, I am always looking for good quality shoes at a reasonable price. (I think I paid under 20 for these.) These are very comfortable and well-made leather shoes. They are soft on the outside and they also match well with soft colors clothing. Since I can no longer wear heels I tend to spend more on athletic shoes that match my wardrobe and these go with a lot of it. I will buy more of this brand in the future."
5,Pleasant video trip,"Informative video of one of our beautiful National Parks.I would hope to visit here some day.Thanks to the quality video presentation, I feel as I already have."
3,Security+ for Dummies,"This book delivers exactly what the title promises. Unfortunately, I now realize that I need something written at a higher level. If you want the basics, buy this book, if you want to pass the Security+ certification exam, you need something more."
2,Not up to normal Dummies par,"I used the CISSP for Dummies to assist a friend in studying for his CISSP cert, which he got.So, when looking at Security+, I opted to purchase the Dummies book.I'm on page 32 and have found some troubling errors.1) The description of a switch (layer 2 switch) is incorrect. Drawing a comparison to a bridge would have been more accurate than saying a ""smart hub.""2) SQL is NOT an example of a Session Layer. SQL is a syntax interface for an RDBMS (relational database management system), which uses a solution specific connector.If I keep finding these minor fudges, I'm going to doubt how useful this book will be to me.In the past, I've found that despite the ""dummies"" moniker, the technical books are usually well written and accurate. More importantly, they often span skill levels, talking to audiences of all levels.This was a disappointment. I normally wait to review a book until I finish, but I'm a tad annoyed with this one."
1,Not as good as advertise,"Work but it leaves the brass dull, I found out just using 50% vinegar and water mixture and a couple of drops of dish detergent will do a lot better for a lower cost and you will not have to put up with harsh chemicals."
2,Unfortunate bias by David Barton,"Unfortunately, David Barton is a conservative, political activist with evangelical motives. This might have a teeny, weeny chance of affecting the quality of this work (it does). Someone asked for an alternative in a comment below. I would would recommend the free ""Jefferson Hour"" podcast. 100+ hours available. The portrayer of Jefferson is an excellent speaker, scholar and doesn't sugar-coat Jefferson. Excellent ""conversation format"", great production quality - interesting and entertaining."
2,"See the movie, don't bother with the book",Poorly written. This is the rare case where the movie is better than the novel which inspired it.
3,started off good and became absurd!,"I ordered this book because i was anxious to read it before seeing the movie. The first half of the book started off really well. Great character description, good feel for India, and exciting story... but, unfortunately, the story became absurd and completely unrealistic... this was the major downfall.If you want to read an exciting and incredible story based in India try the book Shantaram... you won't be disappointed!"
5,Much better than the movie,"I read this book prior to watching the film and was very dissapointed in the movie. The book was a page turner. I could not put it down and finished it in four days. There were several beautiful scenes in the book that brought me to tears. I was looking forward to how the scenes would play out in the movie and was surprised to see the book characters not even included in the movie. I would highly recommend this book if you are looking for a great story you cannot put down. Keep in mind it is a completely different story than the movie, but in my opinion much better."
1,a MAJOR dissapointment,"I was told that Swarup wrote this novel in four months, and wow did it show. This novel is loaded with the most cheesy, mindless accumulation of junk I have ever had to endure through. That might have been harsh, but the repetitiveness, the punch lines, and most of all the bad writing warrants it. Also, it lacks considerably in showing the reality of India's poverty. I was also told that Swarup had never even visited the slum that he writes about and that also shows. It lacks the depth and insight needed for authenticity. I view this novel as sort of like a Bollywood film--all about cheap escapism and no substance. If you're for that, then this will definitely entertained you. It, however, frustrated me more than anything."
2,Extremely disappointed,"I was actually born in Mumbai and Slumdog Millionaire is one of my top 5 movies, but I read this book and was very disappointed. I expected it to be raw and beautiful like the movie, but it wasn't. It was all over the place and very hard to get into. Instead of rehashing everything that everyone said, just read the one and two star reviews, and that's pretty much the way I feel about this book."
5,Great Read,"If you saw the movie version, you will be surprised at the differences. Looks like they cleaned up the script for the movie version to make it more palatable to the audience. Read the book and see for yourself."
4,Enjoyed but lost a star for ending tie ups.,"I enjoyed this book a lot, more then I thought I would after seeing the movie. I gave it three stars because of minor points, though I felt it a good read.Good things about the book1. Definitely better then the movie hands down. (Wonder why they didn't stick closer to the book.)2. The surprises were awesome :).3. I thought the idea of telling the story and then going back to the main point of the quiz show was very well done.Spoilers be here.-------------The Bad1. I thought was some of the unrealistic ties in in the ending with some of the characters.2. The thought that his rabies friend was autistic.. if he could speak before it wasn't autism. As you don't just become autistic."
2,Two Stars for a Good Idea,"This is one of those instances (like Briget Jones' Diary and The Notebook) where the screenwriter and film makers improved upon a book.Originally titled Q&A;, the concept of the book is unique and captivating. The execution, however, is choppy and puzzling. The novel read like a group of loosely connected short stories, which made it easy to put down after each chapter. About three quarters of the way through I decided not to pick it up again. Don't let this stop you from seeing the movie, though, because it's fantastic."
3,Not the Movie,Bears so little relationship to the film (which I loved) that it makes the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar a joke. The book isn't bad; but it bears none of the emotional punch of the movie. Just don't read it expecting to further your movie experience.
1,No music from the series...,"Very disappointed. As with the other reviewer, I to not only watched the series, but was an extra on several episodes during the filming here in NM. Although the CD was ""inspired by the series"" (and after listening to the songs, I think not), I was very disappointed and this cd should be placed in $1.00 CD bin at the music store. Wonder where the original music from the series is? It is certainly not on this CD. VERY MISLEADING."
1,I feel ripped off,"I wanted the exquisite orchestral musical themes I heard during the mini-series, but what I got sent is a bunch of boring pop or country-western songs, not a single one either memorable--or used in the soundtrack of the film.Unless you like boring pop/country stuff, save your money. I sure wish someone had warned me."
5,Into the West,"Good CD it arrived super fast and the songs are great, Sarah is just a great artist and I can listen to her all the time"
1,ditto on the ripped off feeling,"I have an extensive library of instrumental soundtracks. Some of the most beautiful compositions have come out of the period movies, such as this one. Why was there not a soundtrack done of THE soundtrack? The composer, Geoff Zanelli, was hired to score the Steven Speilberg miniseries. Where, oh, where can the REAL soundtrack be purchased?????"
2,needs an ext input for MP3. Loses its programming when power cut,"Our boat has an acc switch to enable the radio. If you totally kill power to this thing it loses all its presets and audio settings. It can be wired to a trickle output to preserve the settings, but our boat doesn't provide that. If you wire it to the battery using the main power wire, your battery will be dead in a day."
1,Where are the pictures,When I get a landscaping book I like to see plenty of examples in full color pictures. Maybe get a few ideas and see what others have come up with that I can mix and integrate into my own water garden. This book is 95% wording and 5% pictures. I thought the book was a little dry and uninteresting. I'm glad I got it on E-Bay for $2.50 because I would never pay full price for it.
1,Journeys Through Bookland Volume 1,I have tried twice to purchase this item. Both times the company advertising the book did not have the book for sale. Each had other volumes of the series but not Volume 1. The error was caught once prior to shipment. Once the wrong book was shipped and had to be returned. I am still looking to purchase the book.
3,"Cute, but not for kids...","Wily's Base is a novel idea. However, it is not executed half as well as it could have been! Most of the set is made of compressed paperboard. It is an issue especially with the walls (with the screens) and the little walkway above. The weight of a normal Mega Man figure makes it quite unstable! It wouldn't be as troubling with the 5' inch figures, but still!The elevator tube (the thing with the skull on it) is three pieces, and the sides went together very hard. It also didn't slide into the (paperboard) base correctly.Still, if it is used for display it's useable. For an actual child wanting to PLAY with it, the secret base would explode in the fashion of most of Wily's menial robots.The Wily figure itself is adorable if you can get one with a non-crazy paintjob. Mine's moustache is a little off, but he's acceptable. Billowing labcoats are just so great."
5,Story of Finding Life,"This is a wonderful book for learning more about Islamic culture, and how some people of that faith are searching foranswers to life's questions that are not found in their faith. This book has been available for awhile, but is still a greatinspiration.Price was good and condition great."
4,God's ways are amazing,This is such a simply told story and appears to be honest and straight from the heart. I am amazed - God can do anything. I also heard Gulshan's story in her own voice and words on uTube. She is a real person of Pakistani origin.
4,Torn Veil,"A very interesting biography of a Muslim girl's conversion to Christianity. Very inspiring and humbling story. Recommended for Christian people, those week in faith will not believe this truly remarkable story."
5,I think it's a balance,"This book is very good for a foundational class in Black Studies or if people just wanted to briefly touch on current issues in the discipline. I believe that it was balance for you had your afrocentrics, your moderate, and your conservatives. I think this book highligihhts pertinent issues which you really can't find in many books."
4,wonderful,"This is a beautiful book of excellent quality hardcover, that is very inspirational for lovers of stumpwork. I agree with the other reviewers; it is essential to have the first book 'Stumpwork: A collection of fruits, flowers and insects' as there are constant cross references to instructions only found in the first book."
5,A must for any stitcher,"I agree with the person from Virginia, this is an excellent book with beautiful projects but you need to have her first book to understand the references. Personally, this doesn't bother me. Besides, what stitcher doesn't have a large stash anyway? :) The suggested projects are absolutely gorgeous!"
4,New 2005 release is the better buy!,"This book and the first book, A Collection of Fruits, Flowers and Insects have been republished as a single volume! It's title is The Complete Book of Stumpwork Embroidery and it is available here on Amazon for about the same price as just one of these books![...]I'd give the material in the book a 5 star, the projects are beautiful and the instructions fantastic. The 4 star rating was given because of the confusion. When it was published in two volumes no where on the cover did it say you needed the companion book and people ended up buying the second book and being disappointed because they did not have it first. Then it was republished but didn't clearly state it was a reprint of the two earlier works and had a different cover so people that own the original two volume set would be very disappointed if they bought a new book that was an exact copy of something they already own."
2,better if you have companion book with it,"Lots of black and white pictures. This book continues it's projects based off an earlier publication, which one needs on hand to reference too. So as a beginer to the craft... I now have to go buy the earlier publication in order to complete this book. over all, I will be pleased with the book once I get all the ducks in a roll."
3,better stops.,"The stop is ok, problem is the size requires a 4 inch fence. I cant have that high a fence under my radial saw. It does have an adjustible lens so you can zero it in to a tape measure on a t-track. Ok for table saw sleds"
3,Decide for Yourself,Firsthand accounts from a diverse array of people about their experience stalking and sighting the beast that goes by so many names and insights such controversy. Lots to see and listen to here for Sasquatch enthusiasts!
4,One Great Movie,The first time I seen this movie I was a young child and seen it at the drive inn with my mother and father. It was good then but great now! Our whole family seems to like this film. If you like car chases and classic muscle cars this is a must see film. And the cast is great as well and well I am a female but think Susan George is so hot!
4,Did you miss these 2 scenes?,"I noticed there were 2 scenes missing from this movie. Both take place during the change from the chevy to the Charger.1. A group of men are tossing quarters against a wall. The one that gets his quarter closest to the wall wins. Larry plays ""stupid"" like he has never seen this game before. The let him play and he wins all of the quarters.2. Right after they take off in the Charger the police are interviewing the men who grabbed Mary. They ask for a description of the car. 1st guy says"" hey, did you hear that 351 cleveland. 2nd guy says "" That was a stock block 426 hemi, 3rd guy says "" your both wrong, it was a 440, I saw the decal"".My description might be a little bit off since I have not watched my vhs version of this movie in a few years. Anyone else notice anything else missing? Still a very good movie.But with missing scenes and a documentery that does not talk enough about the Charger used in the film I could only give it 4 out of 5."
2,Not what I remembered,"I remember seeing this movie as a young teen in the mid seventies, especially the ending, but watching it as an adult it is reallykind of stupid.No storyline or plot, just drive like crazy and run from the police.Peter Fonda never became the actor his father was, even his goofy sisterJane is a better actor."
3,"Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry","A romp through the country in a hot rod. A drive-in movie type picture completely void of any message, just fun. I liked it."
4,Classic movie,This movie is fun to watch and is a classic. My son laughs every time he watches it and he is 43 years old.
2,Lousy argument,"If you want to see a series of unreal crashes and a dissapointing ending, this is your movie."
3,Mary and Larry,"I had never heard for this movie, but my husband had seen it when he was young. All though the plot drags in places the car chase scenes are great. lots for old muscle cars, doing what they do best. Great rental."
3,Sentimental,It's hard to write a review on this as it was purchased for sentimental reasons only. To be honest I don't like the movie --- it's corny-- bad acting plots moves poorly. Really low grade
4,Classic car chase,"Loved this movie when it came out and loved seeing it again.No doubt it is NOT the full original version.At least 1 scene is chopped.When the Charger leaves the flea market the locals are describing the car.They cut out the part that went something like this ""did you hear that 351 cleveland?"" ""It was a 440,I saw the decal"""
4,"One of the best,crash movies!!","A crazy Peter Fonda and the ditzy but Beautiful Susan George in a awsome car chase movie with real stunts and crashes. Just goes to show you , slow down and live life, it's to short!! Great Flick ****"
4,Oldie But Goodie,"Peter Fonda riding the crest of his wave (The Trip, Easy Rider), good story, good stunts, excellent special effects. All around crowd pleaser."
4,Another great 70's muscle car movie.,"I remember seeing this movie on the big screen at the cinema, I was 13. This is a fun movie if you don't take it too serious, just have fun with it. Although the younger crowd of today might not get it, because of it's heavy use of 70's terms. Lots of bell bottoms and no one wears seat belts in those days...even the cops. As someone mention..Larry didn't come off as ""crazy"" enough as he could have but still a good effort.And of course the ending was a blast. If nothing else, the ending will stay with you the rest of your life. It did for me."
3,They don't call them that for nothing.,"Talk about a blast from the past. Leave it to Tarrantino to dredge this one up and repackage it for a young audience. As fun as this movie was to watch at the time, there wasn't much to it except for the killer ending. Peter Fonda and Susan George gave it a hipper attitude than other 70's high speed movies like Vanishing Point, Sugarland Express and Smokey and the Bandit, but the muscle cars were the main attraction. Nothing like having 440 cubic inches of V-8 engine under the hood!"
3,"Dirty Amry, Crazy Larry","Not having seen this movie when it was first released I had no idea what to expect, but very quickly I was back in the 70's. Whilst I felt some of the acting was tame, it was probably the script that the actors had to work with that was the problem. As a piece of entertainment for a car guy I thought it was alright."
4,Muscle Cars Running,"A great car chase movie with cool cars from the golden era of muscle cars and a great endind. If you're looking for great acting, get over it."
2,neither dirty nor crazy,sometimes cult classics are better when they are just out there. it was hard to watch the entire movie in one sitting.
2,"Good for action, not for plot","The movie is pretty good for action, the plot though is terrible. I also don't find the leading lady to be attractive at all."
2,"This book teaches Flash 5, not Flash MX","This book is simply a rehash of Rosenzweig's Flash 5 for fun and games book. He teaches NONE of the new MX concepts or tools, he simply developes in MX like he would in 5 (you can do that in MX).Flash MX, which is the recently released upgrade to Flash 5, gives a game developer scores of new features and functionality and Rosenzweig uses none of it.If you really want to buy this book, buy the Flash5 version, it's cheaper and exactly the same thing."
4,Its the Flash 5 book... yet he says that clearly.,"If you read it he says its the same as the older book(Its the 2nd edition, meaning its an updated version!), but each chapter adds 1 new file to it and he does modify some of the games to MX, such as the drawing stuff. One of the biggest additions to it... is platform gaming! The only reason why this book doesn't get a 5* rating is because some of the code he uses is really in efficent. One great example is the maze chase game. The code really only allows for one enemy and it still if a bit iffy there... so i can make some pretty nifty games.if you a beginner or an you know flash but you want to get serious get this book. but if your an expert then you might compramise some of you understanding of flash action scripting because some of it is coded inefficently."
3,There's probably a better book out there...,"The examples in the book are not updated and show an older method of writing action script. While it still works, it's not the best way to learn the current methods."
5,"Great transaction, but...","The five stars are only for the price and quality of transaction for the distributor. The book, however, deserves 3 max. If you want to know how to create these specific games, then look no further. If you want to learn the theory behind the games so you can easily go on to create your own, buy another book. This is a good tool if you are interested in Rosenzweig's style of programming, but only that. If you wish to expand your knowledge of ActionScript on a more modular and appliable level, I would suggest Flash MX 2004 Savvy or an ActionScript Bible (for the more advanced topics)."
3,Nice idea but poor quality,"Costume runs a bit small. Poor quality so it ripped while child was in costume for only 1 hour. Expected better material, but you get what you pay for."
5,Very Hot,I played this game with my boyfriend after we hadn't seen each other for more than a month and I thought I would have a heart attack! It was great for getting to know each other again (physically) and the suspense nearly drove him crazy. He said (and I agree) that it led to the best sex ever. Highly recommended!
3,NATIONAL SLEEP RAFFIA PRINT DOWN COMFORTER,GREAT PRODUCT KEEPS YOU WARMIF HAVE ANIMALS SHOULD NOT GET ON TOP OF IT TEARS EASY
4,True to form.,"Firstly, you have to like Glenn O'Brien's sarcastic attitude to enjoy his book. Pick up a GQ and read his column first, if you haven't already.My only critcism is that he spends too much time talking about things other than clothing, when there's still so much more that could be explained. I'm not sure this is entirely his fault, as he set out to print the answers to his most frequently asked questions. Still, often the things we need answered the most are the questions we never even thought to ask.What I do like, and what makes the book a worthwhile purchase, is that O'Brien represents clearly for us the difference between style and fashion. Most people who would buy this book already have a subscription to GQ, at least. This guide helps us steer clear of the latest faux pas the fashion world is trying to sell."
4,A Well-Rounded Guide for Gentlemen at large,"Mr. Glenn O'Brien has written a book that will hopefully help shape the way many people look at style. O'Brien shows the reader common sense answers to all of life's style inquires. Women are touched- metaphorically, of course-as well as topics including how men who perspire greatly should avoid deoderants with alluminum. The book is featured in a question/answer format, with O'Brien supplying anecdotes in between. This book falls a tad short of being a complete guide, but I don't think it was meant to be one. O'Brien's, ""The Style Guy,"" won't instruct the proper way to tie a tie, but it will give you answers to some frequently asked questions, as well as a good laugh. Pick this one up, you won't regret it."
2,GQ no more,"The beginning of the end of GQ was the exit of Art Cooper, et al and their replacement by a new generation of editors of whom O'Brien is one.Richman andIt's not so much that O'Brien is terrible, but when you compare the writing in this book with that of Cooper and the old GQ, you see what style really is, and how far the magazine has fallen into the realm of boys magazines, e.g., Maxim.America could really use a real men's magazine again."
1,Help Keep this Man Employed,"It's nice to see that leftover 70's trend merchants can still make a living re-packaging their columns. Please buy the book now, since nearly all of this ""advice"" will stop making sense the moment the Rat Pack Revival evaporates."
1,A Bore,"O'Brien's columns for GQ are useless, this book is ever more so. Sarcasm and acting like a smart-ass are his trademarks. Both are absolutely boring from such a witless person."
2,Should have been a board book,"This book is cheap. Cute, but cheap. I was expecting a board book, and the content would have been just right for one. It's paperback, with two staples in the middle. I think $...would have been a fair price, especially since I had to reiforce our copy with tape before I could let our 20-month toddler have it. She does enjoy it, and the art is cute, but I felt cheated by the poor quality."
3,M IS FOR MONSTER,"This is a good book for teaching A,B,C,'s to little one's. It doesn't have big words in it. It's great for little one's from 2 or 3 on up. It's fun to read and educational. I think you'll like this book."
5,"A year later, still the best!","I bought this book a year ago and own about 8 alphabet books. This is THE one my 5-year-old boy likes -- even after the stagelights from the movie have long-since dimmed. Definitely worth the [money]-- I would even pay [more money] if it came in a board-book version since the weight of the pages is a little on the flimsy side, and it shows after all the use. ..."
4,Great Brief by True Champagne Enthusiasts,"As the title indicates, this is a quick overview of champagne. The book is mainly filled with photos, but gives a good synopsis of how champagne is made. It also provides some very interesting recipes made with champagne (Champagne Poached Salmon) or to accompany champagne (Grilled Nectarines with Prosciutto). It is written by enthusiasts for someone interested in learning more about champagne (i.e. it includes basics like how to properly open a bottle and store it, as well as interesting historical facts.)If you enjoy a good glass of bubbly and would like to learn more about where champagne comes from and how to enrich your life with creative champagne ideas, this book is for you. It is worth the read."
3,Does Not Live Up To Its Premise,"The premise of the book is supposed to be: 'Transforming Your Psychological Blocks to Release the Writer Within'. This book is more about the musings and frustrations of working writers and the reality of the writer's life than it is about how to OVERCOME Writer's Block. If you have Writer's Block, the book you need is ""Unstuck: A Supportive and Practical Guide to Working Through Writer's Block"" by Jane Anne Staw, Ph.D. The only words I underlined in Dennis Palumbo's book were, ""It means I don't have to be so damned special to write."" and ""wherever you're at,...becomes the crucible out of which your writing flows."" The message of ""Writing From the Inside Out"" is better said and more insightfully discussed in ""Unstuck"". THAT is the book to buy."
4,Fast Paced Coming Out Story,Stuart Thorogood has put together a fast paced modern story about coming out in working class London. I was most impressed with his excellent ear for dialogue. The streets and attitudes of London come alive in these pages. I found myself not able to put it down. This is not your typical mushy love story. It is a story about the search for an identity. A great read.
5,Very interesting,"First of all, I'm impressed with the sound quality of this recording. Excellent remastering job. She's not entirely to my taste but what she did, she did well and with a lot of spunk. I'd recommend this to anyone who is interested in rockabilly."
5,Walking To Martha's Vineyard,"The poems here are heartbreaking and worthy of reading every day. Franz Wright has been down as low as one can go, and he reports back to the world with the grace and wonder of being alive, seeing evidence of spiritual rebirth all around him, or as he writes in the opening poem, ""There is nothing but."" May he continue to live well."
2,the metaphysical conceit,"Franz Wright appear to have a great deal of natural talent (he is the son of James Wright, after all), but there's something bluff about the poems themselves. It's as though they have to be spoken in a whisper to be believable. Any poem that can't be read in a full voice without laughing is taking itself way too seriously. And that was my problem anyway with this collection."
4,BIGTRAV01,"WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS CD I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK BECAUSE I STILL LOVE HIS 1ST CD STUNTS,BLUNTS & HIP HOP TO DEATH BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT ERA AND IT'S HARD TO GET MY MIND OUT OF THAT ERA,BUT I LIKE THE CD. IT'S A DIFFERENT DIAMOND D BUT STILL GOOD IN MY OPINION PROBABLY CAN'T FIND THE CD ANYWHERE ONLINE BUT ON AMAZON OR A SITE THAT MIGHT SELL OBSCURE CD'S BY IT AND GIVE IT A CHANCE."
1,it's not for mac!,it's not for mac and I can't open any file on the disc= =! I feel really disappointed of this product
4,Give this guy a break,"I too am surprised to see so much negative feedback on this book.On the positive side it is filled with hard to find information on making hydrogen and using it. It would have taken me dozens of weeks to find this information on the web - if I even knew where to look. So at less than $20 this is a real bargain. It reminded me of many forgotten methods of creating hydrogen. This book has real value.On the negative side...Mr. Peavey what were you thinking? You need to hire a good technical editor to remove all the typos. You also need to hire a graphic designer to make this book look good. The information is great for tinkerers and R&D; people like myself, but when you package it in such an amateur way it gives the impression that the content also lacks value. If you fix the errors, redesign the book and put it in a hardcover (that cheap laminated cover curls like crazy) you could charge 3 times the price.Just my 2 cents worth."
1,Fuel From Water -- No Info is better than Wrong Info,"Practical information abounds in this book by Michael Peavey. The problem is, a lot of it is wrong in minor but dangerous ways. Spelling is bad enough to be distracting, and math and mixed unit errors make this _not_ the book to follow in building equipment that uses an explosive fuel. To his credit, he does cover the topic well and also provides a useful bibliography and list of sources -- from the mid 80's. From an engineering standpoint, the text approaches the Anarchist's Cookbook in it's sheer amateurism, and in its liklihood of getting someone hurt who follows it. If Amazon would take this book back, I'd send them the ashes. -Greg Richter"
3,Hydrogen is the future,"As a student I found the book to be useful. Not terribly useful, but useful. I particularly found the table describing the energy content of many different types of fuel to be useful. My primary finding was that hydrogen contains 3 times more energy per kg than does gasoline. Perhaps the reading was dry and there were some poor spelling but who cares? If the content is helpful and accurate then the difference between ""braking"" and ""breaking"" is irrelevant; semantics are for poetry majors not scientists. If the equations are inaccurate then please clarify, don't just complain about it. Give specific examples, much like the spelling corrections. The more I see people refute the potential of hydrogen the more I think they work for the oil industry. Oil is a dead end and we all know it. Let's move forward with getting hydrogen figured out."
3,a little disapointed!,"I ordered the book expecting to get some SECRETS! well it did not give them to me,but I got my $worth?"
3,What a Misleading Title...,"I received the twelve edition of this book, and was disappointed even after I read reviews that gave me an idea of what to expect. The main flaw of this book is that the title does not accurately reflect the information presented in the book.-There is only a short, but detailed section on separating hydrogen and oxygen from water.-Fails to bridge the technical gap between ""water powered engines"", those that seperate water just prior to combustion, and ""hydrogen engines"" those that store and use pure hydrogen for combustion.-The majority of the book gives detailed schematics and diagrams of pure hydrogen engines, storage methods, uses, history.-Overall for its cost this book is a good technical reference for people interested in hydrogen as an alternate fuel."
3,At least they're still trying!,"This is a nice litle single from Paul (one half of Orbital) and Robert (lead singer of The Cure). I bought this knowing that it wouldn't be terribly amazing, however I had to get it because of the veterans who made it. Much love to both. But...the stars say it all. 3 / 3.5. Paul adds a nice breakbeat with some decent celestial echoes in the background. Robert's voice sounds surprisingly good, and the lyrics are a plus to boot. It just isn't very catchy. The 2 remixes are at par with the original."
1,unwatchable!!!,This movie was awful from the quality of the picture to the story line. It is obvious that it was simply taken from a VHS tape and not really digitaly transfered. Save your money.
1,Not what it says it is!,I ordered this car cover for my Cobra. The picture displaying the car cover was a Cobra. After ordering the company emailed to verify the size. I gave them the dimensions and when the cover arrived I could have put two Cobras under it. It was huge!
5,Jim Reeves Radio Days,"You got to hand it to our friends at Bear Family.They really know where to get this great material as well as putting it out.This is Vol 2 of Jim Reeves radio days.4 discs of more Great Jim Reeves material.If your a Jim Reeves fan,this is a must have.I wonder if Vol 3 will be on its way out to us?"
3,Beautiful style but...,From the style I loved the watch but from the size and width it was not for me. If that watch was only half as wide I would have loved and kept it. Would look more elegant. But the workmanship is excellent. Beautiful watch but for me too wide.
4,Good quality with difficult clasp,The clasp definately takes some time to figure out and get used to as others have described. The watch seems to be great quality and with the right outfit looks great
5,"Fun to read, fun to do","This book is fun to read and fun to do -- and it's more than just yoga and breathing exercises. Great ideas here on everything from eating well to looking beautiful, at much more than the superficial level. This is a wonderful gift for any girl (or woman) who wants to have ""style, strength and serenity."""
5,30 Something Pregnant Om,"I think this book is a great guide not only for young women to become involved with yoga and all the attributes that the activity can provide for self-esteem, fitness, and spiritual well-being, but also for older women to refresh their outlook on life and attain the same benefits. I am pregnant with my first baby, and daily yoga has helped rejuvinate my energy and maintain flexibility which is vital as the baby grows."
3,Not a book on the trial,This is a rather rambling book on the Nazi Eichmann who was hiding in Argentina and brought back to trial in Israel by Israeli agents. This book covers the cultural and political atmosphere during that period.It does not go into details as to how Israeli agents kidnapped Eichmann and brought him to Israel. If you are looking for a book on how the trial was conducted and the defences raised this is not for you.
5,Refreshing and Classic!,"This is a fantastic album that I recommend not only for those who love Latin music but also for all good world music listeners.Composed by fifteen songs (then of them are originals) this record includes traditional rhythms such as cha-cha-cha, son, bolero and rumba and also some tracks in which fusion of rhythms (e.g. son and conga) originates remarkable songs.One of the main attractives of this album is the superb voice of the leading singer. She has a strong and mature voice that, in my opinion, puts her together with ladies such as Celia Cruz and Celina Gonzalez.In conclusion, don't miss it!"
3,Good look but a bit stiff,"i have two of these and use them in the field. i like the open top due to the easy of grabbing them then u need to. this is a great product but ive had some nylon ones that work a bit better.reasons for the 3.the cuffs sit much higher then in the picture. like maybe 1/2 of the cuff it out of the pouch (might be an issue with uniforms regs at some departments)the retention is very tight great for keeping them in when u run,fall,fight,ect. however pulling them out they get stuck sometimes. and putting them back into the pouch sometimes takes two hands.for a leather open top its great but they havent broke in any after several months of wear."
4,Story of a Woman of pre-cultural revolution China,"This book is a personal account of friendship that developed between an American woman raised and working in China and a Chinese woman raised in the pre-cultural revolution period. Madame Yin is a strong, intelligent person who is an individual of her time. Ida describes Madame Yin with a great respect and love as well as the curiousity of one culture for another. I came away from the book with a much greater appreciation for Chinese family values and traditions. This is a quick but very informative read. Ida writes in he first person narrative and, although her writing is only occasionally stilted (a product of its time as well), she is an excellent story teller."
1,eBook disappointment,"I was totally disappointed by what I thought would be a positive introduction to Data Integration, an important topic in my field of ecology and database management. Was I surprised when I opened the eBook pdf file and 6 of the 21 pages of a $150 purchase were basically blank (not white space necessarily but they were not text or information concerning to book's content). In the eBooks favor however, it has good content and information concerning data integration. Just it is very difficult to swallow a $150, 15 page white paper. Content = 3+ stars, value for price = -5 stars."
5,"Remember, the song you can never forget","Enchanting, Beautiful, Perfect. These are only some of the words that come to mind when i hear this song. It is quite possibly one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I only wish I could track down more songs like this. If anyone reads my review and knows of such songs please email me : gideon@h3o.net"
2,This dude is IN LOVE with himself,"I actually enjoyed reading this book, don't get me wrong. But...this guy does nothing but tell us how great he is. It's ironic he does a chapter on the ego of Reggie Jackson, and then spends the rest of the book talking about how his nickname is GROOVE and he is the greatest. He did this, he did that. It's unbelievable. Hey Don, get that ego in check please. It's ironic that everytime something happens, it was because of Don Baylor. But better yet, they lose the 1979 playoffs because a mediocre pitcher like Dave Barr is injured. Please, that's like saying the the Braves lost the playoffs because Ozzie Guillen was out. And Mr. Baylor, according to Maury Wills' book, you were messing around with Wills' woman. Is this true? It seemed to be missing in the book. Well Groove, yes or no?"
1,Hogwash. Nothing but the truth is several lies instead,I grew up in Austin with Don Baylor and this book is a total fabrication of life in Austin written to make Don Baylor look good. He never bought his parents a house. He only leased them one.
3,AN OK READ,"THIS IS A STORY ABOUT DON BAYLOR WHO PLAYED FOR A VARIETY OF TEAMS IN THE 70'S AND 80'S. A RARE COMBO OF SPEED AND POWER. I ENJOYED THIS AND RECOMMED IT FOR FANS OF THE ORIOLES, ANGELS, AND YANKEES. IT MAKES A SOME INTERESTING INSIGHTS AND FACTS. NOTHING GREAT BUT A SOLID STORY."
1,Worst book ever. Deserves zero stars.,"Poorly written, unrealistic, waste of time. Note that the overall rating for this book is probably boosted by reviews from the publisher -- just read the language they use in their reviews. Too ""pro""."
5,Wonderful fast-paced read!,"I read this book in one sitting. I loved it! I liked the interaction and the dediction between the old and the young, between friends and family.It also gave me pause for thought. What would I do if I found a bag of money. I don't know. I found this to be a wonderful story as all Fern Michaels' novels are."
4,pleased,"enjoyed this book of hers. It was a welcome relief from all the 'sisterhood' novels. However, I still feel she draws everything out, then ties it up in hurry to finish."
2,"iceD tea, thank you","This book was a great first draft. As with all first drafts, it needed some polishing, and some filling in. The author had a great plot, but, not enough details. I wanted to know how she struggled and what all she went through to succeed in her business, instead we read that she opens her business on a shoestring and boom, she's rich and owns stores everywhere. The ""urst"" element was there, (unrequited lust), but was taken a little bit too far and began to get a bit tedious. I would have given this book three stars except that for several chapters the author kept mentioning ""ice tea"", over and over. Now one grammatical error is understandable, but to keep saying it over and over again really gets on one's nerves and takes away from the story. Why not serve lemonade or bourbon, at least she could spell it."
4,Spectacular!,"On graduation day for Anna and Jane, the bank was robbed, the crooks caught, and Anna found the missing stolen money hidden in her car. Instead of immediately returning it, she tells no one and uses it to begin her new business and care for her ailing mother. Once financially secure, she planned to return the money, anonymously, with interest. The insurance investigator is hot on her trail, but has no proof. In fact, he thinks Jane found the money and Anna is covering for her!Ten years later, business has gone as she dreamed. However, the thief is now out of prison and hunting Anna.*** Fern Michaels shows that there is no such thing as easy money! A wonderful story filled with some of life's tough decisions, hope, dreams, and romance. Spectacular! ***"
1,"very slow story line, characters are not stong enough","I was really disappointed with the book. In fact I haven't even been able to finish it. Annie is someone I could not connect with. She seemed like a nice person, but as soon as she became successful, she started treating people badly. This is one book you shouldn't waste your time or money on. The conversations between characters were stilted and unnatural."
3,Hope the other books are better!,"This is my first F.M. novel and I really was disappointed with it. The main character Annie didn't have any reason to keep money stolen from a bank. Especially after her business took off so quickly. Putting her ""best friends"" Jane and Elmo through such trama as suspects having the stolen money for such a long time is way too selfish for me. Annie made tons of money, so why keep the money at someone elses peace of mind? I also thought Annie was portrayed as more of a business shrew than a savvey one. I also found it unreal after a one night stand with her coffee supplier, Parker to wait 11 years to get back with him? Even though Annie finally gave the bank its money with interest, ( 12yrs+ later) I don't find this woman anyone I'd care to call ""friend"". I'm going to try one more book of F.M's and try again. And then again there's always Elizabeth Lowell, Johanna Lindsay, Catherine Coulter and Virgina Henley to keep me in Romance Novels."
4,plain talking explanations,"Harvey hopes to offer you an easy acquaintance with the many features of Excel. As with other books in this series, little prior knowledge of this subject is assumed. Instead, he describes in plain terms what many common capabilities exist. Some of these may indeed be used with formidable complexity, like having a cell be an intricate function of many other cells. But by offering simple examples, you can see how to utilise these features.By the way, this example of a cell being a function of one or more other cells is of course the key idea of a spreadsheet. It dates back to when they only existed in hardcopy form. While Excel now offers a large portfolio of features, this is still the most important and fundamental one. If you study this book, ensure that you have this knowledge well understood."
2,Basically just for looks,"I bought this because it was so neat looking. The problem is, that's about all it is. It does boil water, but because of it's super small base, it takes forever for the water in the ball to heat. My mother also has this and I always witness her boiling water in a pan and then transferring it to the teapot because it takes so long to boil. What's the point in that? Plus, the handle gets super hot, and you have to remove the ""whistler"" before you pour anything (which also is super hot). Purely for looks."
2,Broken within a month,"This kettle (in red) was bought for me as a Christmas gift. Within the first month of normal use it is falling apart. First a large chip of the red enamel spalled off the lower edge. Then a week later the loop on the whistle popped off due to a weak weld. Now I can't use the whistle because it is too hot to remove when the water is boiling. I am very disappointed because this isn't a cheap kettle, I thought it would be a quality product."
2,"United News, Release 166-171 (1945) Japan Surrenders, De Gaulle Visits U.S.","While not in the same quality of News Reels, quality of video footage is somewhat poor."
4,Snuggle up with a Viking,"Viking's Princess is a great comedic fairy tale; it reminded me a little of ""A Knight's Tale."" One of the differences (besides the fact that the hero is a Viking, not an English knight) is that the snobbish pricess (Alleta) in VP gets her come-uppence. It's hillarious to see how Roark (the hunky hero) ""tames"" Alleta's selfish, shrewish ways. I liked the secondary characters too, but I thought Roark's younger brother Erik kind of mysteriously disappeared towards the end of the novel; would have liked to read a bit more about him.Keep'em coming, Aja!"
5,Viking's Princess is the best!,Aja James is a fantastic new author. Viking's Princess is the best romance novel I have ever read. The characters were all so well developed. Roark is an absolute dream and Alleta is so fantastically snobby that you sometimes wish you could shake her. I hope that Aja James intends to write novels about the other characters. I can't wait to read some more of her works!
5,Mr wrong and Born Yesterday,"have seen these videos several years ago. Born Yesterday is great, since it shows a naive woman in a relationship with a lobbyist, who is not only corrupt but abusive. to see someone that actually knows the US Constition and the Bill of Rights is amazing, and the issue of buying and abusing senators sure hits what is presently going on today. moral of story EDUCATE, EDUCATE,EDUCATE this is not over the top ,mealy moouth preachy messages , it;s happening now. Mr Wrong is one of Ellen's gems."
1,Not so wonderful,"The packaging and discs are in great condition, however, two of the movies sound is poor at best. It sounds like you are listening in a tunnel or a seashell.....very annoying. I am not happy with it at all."
2,"Great Movie, Bad quality","I saw this movie (Born Yesterday) before and wanted to have it in my collection. Since it was not expensive and there were other movies as a bonus, I decided I cannot go wrong about buying it. Right? Wrong!The movie is still great, but there is no captions and the sound quality is awful.Buyer, beware."
2,Not a very good production,"I had hoped this was going to be a bit better, but it was old clips (very old), bad editing and either long chunks of silence on the soundtrack or silly music."
2,not a good movie as the reviewers here say it is,"I just saw this movie on IN HD2. Some people said that this movie is a hidden gem. At first, I felt the same way. I didn't even know such a movie existed. Then after about 30 minutes, the movie became really boring. It just drags on with a weak synopsis. The cast includes some famous actors and actresses, and I think they are pretty good actors, but without an interesting storyline, the movie is a boring piece of work that leaves no impressions."
5,Great Laptop Bag,Perfect size bag and holds everything. Straps are the perfect length to fit right under your arm. Highly recommend this bag!
1,So bad I had to stop reading it,"Is the process of crashing a spacecraft worth dozens of pages? Does Luke Skywalker really want to join the world politics? Would Leia really best Luke in a lightsaber duel? And best of all, would Leia seriously turn to Han and ask him if he was wagering the Millenium Falcon? All of these things happened in the first seven chapters of this book, and they were written so poorly that I felt like I was reading a book written by a teenager. A teenager without much imagination.I literally put the book down, placed the palm of my hand on my face as I contemplated how this book was given a green light. It's so bad that I couldn't finish it, and I've read some bad books. Do yourself a favor and read a wiki."
2,Should have been 1 book not 3,"The whole trilogy could have been easily fit into one book. Imagine taking any one of the other fairly good stand alone books in the Star Wars series and stretching it into 3 books by putting in all sorts of useless information, and completely irrelevant scenarios and you basically have this series. Examples: it takes Han 50 pages to land a disabled ship in book 2 that added nothing to the story, it takes Luke 50 pages to get out of an elevator in book 3. You get to get to read page after page of very uninteresting alien social habits. I'm also annoyed when the author apparently didn't bother to read any of the previous books in the series. Luke seems like a frightened apprentice in this series rather than a Jedi Master, and Leia is an indecisive cry baby."
3,"Oh well, another book to put in the archives.","Although I took great delight in reading these three novels (they were the first SW novels I read) I still think that the story was a bit flat. First of all, the storyline was very depressing. The twins and their 'sidekick' Anakin outwitted their parents time and again, which being a 13 year old seems to be very unlikely. Second, Solo and Organa Solo were absolute suckers, and the return of Gaeriel Captison (who was bland anyway) made the book even flatter. It was truly a disappointment now that I look back on it."
3,not bad,"The Corellian Trilogy was OK for post-Return of the Jedi books - a good amount better than the Jedi Academy Trilogy, but not as good as The Thrawn Trilogy.But instead of those series, I highly recommend the following 5-star novels that are extremely relevant to the film series:Cloak of Deception (Star Wars)Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul)Labyrinth of Evil (Star Wars, Episode III Prequel Novel)Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars)Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)"
2,Why do I keep reading Star Wars novels?,"Does Lucas direct all the writers in these books to bring all the main characters together, come hell or high water? The plot devices used to ensure that all the characters we know and love are brought together, relatively defenseless, on Correlia are laughable - especially Lando and Luke. The Solo children might as well be trained monkeys, for all they contribute, not counting Anakin's very convenient abilities with the force. But, with all that said, the plot is reasonably interesting, once it gets going, and the cliffhanger ending did persuade me to get the next book. This one is certainly better than The Paradise Snare, which was a total disappointment."
2,Read it to satisfy a Star Wars need only,The idea that the new Republic needs outside help defeting a small ramshackle fleet because they moth-balled a substantial part of their fleet 14 years after winning a major battle against a galactic empire is absurd. Particularly when the Black Fleet Crisis trilogy demonstrates how strong the New Republic Navy had become only 2 years previous to this trilogy.This book is inconsistent with the other Star Wars novels in many ways and rates a zero on the feasability scale.It is worth reading only if you have read all the other Star Wars novels.
2,Han Solo is turning 50!,"I simply think this is definitely not the best title in the Star Wars literature. There are a lot of things I did not liked about the book but I guess the greatest dissapointments are the use (again!) of a mass destruction device, didn't we had enough with two Death Stars, World Devastators and Sun Crushers, and now this!. Other fact that disturbs me is the complete abscence of the technical fiction that makes the Star Wars Universe so special. I say, you could spend your money in a far better Star Wars book."
3,decent but not very satisfying,"This book is easy to read and has a simple plot. The target audience seems younger than previous novels (like the Black Fleet crisis). The book ends without any resolution to the storyline, which is expected since this is another trilogy.This far along into the post-movie storyline, the books are starting to feel the same. Part of that feeling comes from the characters being mostly static. Previous adventures don't change the characters. For example, Han approaches troubles in this book in the same way that he did in the earlier books, and Lando is just as care-free and trivial as ever. The stories would be better if the characters matured as time progressed. With characters that never mature and a basic plot, this book isn't all that satisfying for adult readers."
2,A misfire in the Star Wars universe,"In Ambush at Corellia, Han Solo, his wife Leia and their children go back to Han's home world of Corellia for a trade summit. But they are warned before they go that there are ominous things happening in the Corellian system and they must be careful. When they get there things are worse than they imagined as the 3 different species that inhabit the worlds are about to go to war with each other.Unfortunately, this was the dullest of the Star Wars books I've read and the poorest written. There are a lot cliches in the writing and not much life. There's too much of the Solo children and much too much of an uninteresting sub plot about Lando trying to marry a rich woman. The characters weren't right either. Neither Han nor Luke's personalities seemed correct. This was a misfire in the Star Wars universe."
2,Flat,"This book lacked excitement. I didn't like the way the characters were handled, or the plot of the book as a whole. If there was a real plot. For the most part it was an extremely dull family holiday."
2,Where's the Action???,"This book stated out decent, however as the plot devoloped( which happened at the end of the book)the author seemed to purposely delay the action for the next two books in the trilogy. This book wasn't the worst but it certainly could have been much better. The Solo do go on an adventure and the author show how Anakins power is devolping. To sum it all up the book had little action and lots of plot and character building."
3,"Somewhat dull, but an interresting story.","Well, this book isnn't really bad, but it doesn't excell in any way either. I like the 'excursion to Correllia' idea, but this book can be somewhat dull at times. The picture that it gives of the Correllian system is nice but there just isn't very much action or anything else interresting happening. Facinating enough for a Star Wars fan to read, and perhaps for other sci-fi fans interrested in sci-fi traveling stories since that is what's the true strenght of this trillogy (at least, to me it was). The 'siniter plot' in the Correllian trilogy is not much more than a laugh, apperantly you still need Imperials or some extragalactic threat to get a serious looking problem."
1,"Pathetic cash-in, it takes forever for anything to happen","Easily the worst trilogy of books I've ever read in terms of frustratingly boring pace, characters that are inaccurate to the movies or just indifferent. It was a struggle to resist the impulse to bin this without finishing it."
3,fairly good....,....Aside from the fact that Anikin Solo has the vocabulary of a three year old! Apparently Mr. Allen has never really BEEN a seven year old. But other than that minior mistake i believe that this was a pretty good book. (I bought the entire trilogy at once and am to book three: SHOWDOWN AT CENTERPOINT) P.S. Did he make up all this stuff about Coreillia?
3,"Entertaining, but not the best","I found this book entertaining, but not the best Star Wars book by far. The plot is interesting. The Solo family decides to make a trip to Corellia to see where the family roots are. Meanwhile, a deadly group has risen to take over, trying to re-establish a version of the empire. An attack on a rebel building leaves Leia stranded with many others, athough Han is able to escape. Meanwhile, the Solo children have discovered something strange ... This book is good and I didn't have any real problems with it, but if you can't get into books in the first couple of pages, this one isn't for you."
5,wow!,This book is exiting and fast-paced. You'll get your money's worth. This is a must for any Star Wars fan. You have got to get this book!!!
4,The History of the Church,"Excellent reference book for adult catechesis classes, CCD, prison ministries, etc. It is also a very interesting read for Catholics and non-Catholics."
5,Excellent and concise,"Really just an excellent book, and an excellent class in which it was used. The book is not terribly biased (as skeptics might assume), and does not withhold from denouncing atrocities like the Crusades and the Inquisition. Rather, it explains those events and gives the context for them (but does not excuse them). Made me grow stronger in my faith, embrace the Church, and empowered me with the courage (as corny as that sounds) to defend my faith."
5,Essential reading for boomers,"I have long been an admirer of John Amodeo's work. A long-time therapist and counselor, he understand the dynamics of intimate relationships as well as anyone I know. In addition, he is an excellent writer--clear, thoughtful, probing. This book is timely. The boomer generation, especially, with its history of shattered relationship, broken dreams, and burned-out illusions, will benefit from its careful and thorough laying out of the eightfold path to authentic love. Amodeo shows us that real love, which means a deep spiritual and emotional connection, true friendship, and a healthy measure of chemistry and romance, is possible. It seems to me that this book is an indispensable guide for anyone seeking such a union."
4,Helpful and interesting book,This book was adviced to read by a psychologist. It is interesting and helpful. And easy to read.
5,Bring'em back ALIVE!!!,what a change for these guys! The Peachbones have nailed their powerful LIVE sound into a record. charismatic vocals and oceans of riffage will keep you holding your life boat. the slowersongs on the record are soulful and heartbreaking with a fulltilt hopfulness that many artists cannot duplicate. this is a must have album!moze
5,Great for beginners,"I am a beginner in Photoshop CS2 and I found this book to be an easy read and follow. In less than a week, I was able to turn old photographs into new ones and add layers to my designs. I would definitely buy the bible series again."
3,Good and could be better,"Book is big and has technical details on almost all of PS CS2. However, following along using black and white small images in the book proves difficult or impossible. If cost was an issue with the book, then the full size color images should be on the web somewhere. As far as I can determine, they are not. The problem with small b&w; images is stark when it comes to describing blending modes or filters. Larger color pictures or posting the complete set of color pictures on the web would transform this book from3 stars to 5 stars for me."
5,Excellent reerence book for Photoshop users.,A top-notch reference book. Keep it within arms reach. Answers to your questions are answered in terms that can be udestood by the novice or expert.
4,great reference; not the best for a new user,"This book is a great reference It probably does contain everything you want to know about Photoshop CS2, but I wouldn't recommend this to someone as their first book on Photoshop. PS can do so much and this book tells you about all of it. It's just too much for a first-time user. Definitely buy this for your library, but don't start your education with it."
3,"Wiley, the publisher was deceptive on the front cover of this book.","On the front cover it says, ""100% Comprehensive-Authortative"" This is a lie. I was trying to find out how to use the Actions feature. Actions are missing from the book. I emailed one of the authors. I was informed that Actions were left out. I was told that this book is the Standard version. The Professional version has Actions. A book that says on the front cover, ""100% Comprehensive"" should include everything on Photoshop CS2. There is no need for two separate versions. Who knows what else is missing from this book."
2,Beware--the sizing is off--,"I bought one of these capos about 3 years ago, and was very happy with its super-functional design and low profile. I lost that capo at a show, however, and endeavored to purchase an identical replacement, which this is not. This model is much wider and thus does not clamp down nearly as narrow as the previous model, so it just barely fits on the neck of my acoustic guitar when the screw is all the way tightened. For my electric guitars it is of no value. I'm not sure what they were thinking with this redesign--why limit the travel so that it only fits on guitars with the thickest necks? I thought that I had been sent the wrong model, but no--the package states that it is a universal capo for mostly all guitars. Well, unless you play a guitar with a super-fat neck then I would consider this a waste of money..."
4,"Looks great, Works perfectly","It fits great on my Flamenco guitar, and the thin design makes it perfect for playing around & near the Capo, without getting in the way."
5,works great,"easy to put on and tightens quickly, very small and lightweight. My guitar seems to stay in tune after I take it off and I get good sound when it is on."
5,Simple and effective,My Seagull acoustic guitar has a slightly wider than standard fretboard but this capo works perfectly. It was cheap and is easy to use.
2,A bit disappointing,"I bought this Planet Waves ""classical"" guitar capo to use with my Takamine classical guitar. Unfortunately, it does not work very well. The capo runs out of adjustment and does not fully press the strings down when trying to use at the 2nd and 3rd frets. The result is what you'd expect, a muffled buzz on the lower strings due to not being tight on the fret. I guess maybe my Takamine has a slimmer neck profile than what the Planet Waves classical capo was supposed to work with, but it would not have taken much to make this one work. They could have built in more adjustment or made the cushion a little thicker. I'll keep it and try to modify it myself if I can, but I was sure hoping to use it without any of that. I really like the steel string capo, and for that matter, I've liked everything I've ever used from Planet Waves (polishing cloth, circuit breaker guitar cables). But this capo is a bit disappointing."
5,"fits perfectly, acoustic and electric guitars",Easy to use and good cost-benefit relationship. I used this product on an acoustic and electric guitars and fits perfectly in both cases
5,Fits Larrivee neck well,"Got this at the suggestion of folks on the Larrivee forums, and sure enough, it fits the neck of a Larrivee well. There are probably better capos for speedy installation and removal, but if that's not your primary concern, this one does a perfect job once it is on. It is VERY nicely constructed and I expect it to last a lifetime."
3,Not as good as I thought,This item had a very good price but it does not (at least for me and my Martin) put an equal amount of pressure on the strings when in use. I don't recommend it.
5,Planet Waves Capo,"Love this capo on my electric guitar. I can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily. Tried other more expensive capos, but this one is the Winner!"
5,love it,I love this capo better than any I have seen or used. Great quality and price. You wont go wrong with this capo.
4,A-,"This capo is light, efficient; however, if you need to leave E string open for D [etc.] tuning, there's a better, albeit heavier capo on the market."
5,An excellent resource,"When I saw this book, I bought it straightaway, because labor history gets short-shrift in American society. I'm sorry to see it's out-of-stock, but am unsurprised.While this book is fairly mainstream in its orientation, it is very readable and thorough, covering the struggle of working people through the late 1800s to the early 1990s.I consider this book a good starting point for people interested in working people's history. What makes it especially rich is the narrative flow and personal stories that appear throughout it, and the sidebars with songs and other miscellaneous information. This is the way a history book should be written."
4,Fascinating and fun!,"The book that accompanies the CD is superbly produced with high quality color pictures, notes about the artists, descriptions of the culture, and remarks about the recording process for each track. As a one-purchase introduction to the music of indigenous peoples, it can't be beat. But be careful--after reading about and listening to this music, you may find yourself wanting to purchase lots more music you only get to sample here."
4,Incredibly Interesting,This cd paired with the book is really fasinating. The book allows you to listen to the unique musical sounds of native instruments and gain a better appreciation for other cultures.
3,Misleading book title,"This is a good storage book overall but... released under wrong title. If you erase ""networking"" part out of the title, it will be exactly what the book is about. Author himself emphasize the book is not really about ""connecting function"". He also introduces some new terms and even though these are quite acceptable for the discussion matter those terms barely might be seen somewhere else."
5,heated pet water bowl,"There's nothing to not like. Well built with heavy-duty plastic bowl, wire wrapped power cord and a thermostat to keep power cost down. I like that the excess cord can fit under the rim of the bowl. It's been a cold winter down South and the pets still need a consistent water supply, I'm very happy with this product!"
4,Good for the price,"cord could be longer, but for the price I paid on Amazon it was buy. I purchased three of them...should have gotten a few more while they were on sale."
5,Heated Pet Bowl,"Great product, keeps the water from freezing and uses less electricity than other heated pet bowls."
2,Broke after 3 months,"I used two of these as bird waterers this winter. One was purchased in November, and recently (late Feb)it quit working (water froze overnight). It is on the same outdoor outlet as the other, so is not an electrical supply problem. I initially bought one of the foil-type birdbath de-icers, also from Farm Innovators; it broke after three weeks, I returned it and I bought another, which did not work out of the box (returned also). I think Farm Innovators makes junk, and strongly recommend that buyers look for something else."
2,"""Do not use extension cords.""","The cord is approximately 5' long. A warning on the bottom of the bowl reads ""Do not use extension cords."" What an amazingly versatile product! (sarcasm)"
2,Good for a while,"The bowl never keep water completely liquid during really cold spells, (in the single digits) but certainly enough of the huge capacity was ample to supply water to a large dog. However, this is the 3rd season using it and apparently the last; the water was completely frozen over the morning after I plugged it in for the first time... temp got to only about 28 degrees. Debating getting a new one or not. Not sure the price warrants only 2 years of service."
3,I would like to see it keep the water warmer.,This bowl was purchased to replace one I had outside with the kitties for years. The water doesn't freeze but it does not warm the water like the old one did. It is the beginning of the winter so time will tell how it hold up.
2,Dogs turn it over too easily,"The bowl is too light and the dogs constantly turn it over, spilling the water. It needs to have a heavier bottom on it."
2,Farm Innovators P-60 heated pet bowl,"I purchased a number of these heated pet bowls. I reason that I have purchased a number of them is that they typically only last through one winter. I have a collection of approximately 8 of these bowls. Every winter I end up purchasing a new bowl, since the one that I used the prior winter no longer heats. They are the only bowl readily available in the area where I live so I just buy another one hoping for better performance. The good news is while they work they are a good bowl. The bad news is that they have a very short life for the heating circuit. I am going to buy a different brand of heated bowl this time even if I have to buy online. Recommendations: stay clear of the Farm Innovator P-60 unless you want a good summer bowl."
4,Farm innovators heated pet bowl,"WE used this for water for our chickens ,it has been down to 12 degrees here and the water was not frozen , only had it a few weeks so dont know about long time use"
5,A Real Book In Real Times!,"This book speaks directly to men of all ages, married or single. Bishop Thomas speaks candidly to men and women and the vitals roles of both. Men need to stand up and take responsibilty taking care of their families with the leading of God and women need to realize the jewels they are and not accept anything! This is an excellent book for a men's seminar or men's retreat to deal with real issues that can bring about an awesome transformation and growth! I would also recommend this book to single women and teenage girls as well so they can have a ""measuring tool"" in what to look for...a ""stud or stallion."""
3,Marketing to Women,Overall I thought the information was pretty good however a lot of it was geared for the big market place but you get the idea anyway. I would have liked a few more examples of ads for inspiration
5,Winning the gender marketing war.,"This book could change the way you think about marketing.For some reason when i think marketing i think men, not any more. This book has some valuable insights into who spends the cash and what on, and most importantly how to get your hands on some of that money."
3,Thin and flimsy,"These do have a good clip as was previously noted, but the board itself is the same cheap, bendable, cost-cutting, let down that can be purchased from your local outlet of the nationwide discounter where prices are more important than quality."
1,Lame,"Sad, lame, slow, disappointing. I went to sleep, and I'm a AFV fan! But this seems to be a collection of so-so stuff, only good for a chuckle now and then. Nothing like the TV show. Wish I hadn't bought it."
1,Misleading,I thought this was part of the AFV collection. It was not. The man doing the voice over is as lame as the clips. Do not buy.
3,The fabric is not what I expected.,"These sheets were the color I expected. They were also nice and deep, and fit my exceptionally deep mattress well. This is not always the case even with sheets that claim to be extra deep. My one complaint is the fabric. I expected something extremely soft, and more like the microfiber fabric used to make bras and underwear, perhaps something stretchier like a jersey knit. The fabric is very smooth, has a bit of a sheen, and has no stretch. It reminded me a bit of fake satin sheets without the glossy finish crossed with polyester. They are extremely light weight which would be great for summer. Overall they are very nice, I simply don't enjoy the feel of the fabric, and I wonder at how easily they would rip considering how very light weight they are."
3,Comfy & cheap with minor drawbacks,"These sheets are what you'd expect for the money. They are comfortable, they are cheap, and they've held up well over the past six months for me (no pilling as other reviews indicated). Here are the drawbacks:- Thin (most paper passes less light through it)- Propensity to come off the bed (the fitted sheet could have a bit more taught elastic)At this price point, the fact that they've lasted six months impresses me. If you want comfy, soft, cheap sheets...these do just fine."
1,Not worth it,I bought the hunter set about a month ago....it's not worth the money at all....the quality is poor and after the first wash one of the pillowcases had holes.....to top it off the fitted sheet didn't even fit my bed! It's too much hassle to try to return it. I wouldn't recommend this product at all
3,Okay for the price,"I was a bit disappointed when they first arrived, they seemed very thin and flimsy, but once I put them on, they're not too bad; they feel a little like satin sheets when you lay on them. They should be fine for summer use in particular."
1,not what I expected,I was looking for a nice light weight sheet set for the warm weather thats coming. But the quality just was not there. The sewing is terrible. Looks like this set was a reject!!!
2,Don't purchase,"These are horrible,they tend to fuzz up with lint balls,they do not stay on the bed,so while you move around while sleeping you get caught up in both sheets,not worth the 16.00"
3,Not great.,"As I took them out of the package, I was glad they were thin. I tend to get hot as I sleep, especially in Tennessee in the summer, so thin isn't bad. After washing them and putting them on the bed, the fabric began to peel and create little balls. I'm still going to use them, but at this price, I suppose I got what I paid for."
1,Very light and Flimsy,"This sheet set is so thin you can see right through it. The elastic does not hold on my bed, used it once washed it and put it away. Total waste of money unless you wanted to punish a guest that has stayed too long at your home. Looks great in the picture, maybe the material could be used for summer curtains or something."
1,Don't waste your money,These sheets have several seams that are not sown together. The fitted sheet pops off the mattress whenever I turn over. The texture is far from soft and silky. The fabric is so sheer I feel as if I am sleeping between kleenex. These sheets are heading back to Amazon for a refund. I would be embarrassed to sell this product.
2,color was incorrect,"I ordered these sheets in 3 sizes, king, full and twin in the color Plum. All 3 sets stated the color was Plum on the tags but all 3 sets were a completely different shade of purple. The color ranged from dark, reddish, purple to a very light lavendar; they weren't even close.Since I needed them to match, I returned them right away. The return process was easy which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one."
1,The worst sheets I have ever owned!,"These sheets are DREADFUL! I ordered two sets and wish I never did. I was so very disappointed the moment I took them out of the package. They are paper thin (I guess that is what polyester ""microfiber...feels like silk"" means!). Our mattress is 15"" thick and these sheets curl up the moment we make the bed and shift around all night.I washed them before putting them on our bed, but never got to use one of the sheet sets because a third of the stitching came undone in wash! I called Amazon to complain. They let me return them but with only a partial refund because they claimed the error was not theirs. I got stuck paying the $8 for shipping using their preprinted label.Just a dreadful experience all around. Don't try to save money on sheets -- you get what you pay for! Amazon does sell some great sheets by Tommy Hilfiger. They cost 5 times as much but are excellent quality and well worth the price."
1,Too Thin and easily Torn. Will not last!,"Purchased 2 pcs of this. Big mistake. I have dry skin and my feet always catches onto the microfiber. After 2 weeks of use, the bedsheets looks very worn and old. Spend the extra $$$ and purchase 250+ thread count sheets."
3,Super soft sheets...but .....,"These sheets were soooo soft the first time I slept on them although they were a little small for my king bed. They also tend to shift and move while you sleep and come off the bed. But I think the softness of them makes up for this. Also, when you have wash them a few times, they get little fuzzies on them. But I would still recommend these sheets because they are so comfortable to sleep on!"
3,Pike Sreet Microfiber Solid Sheet Set,The color shown was exactly what I got. The feel of these sheets is nice and very soft but the fit of the bottom sheet as well as the pillow cases is off. I consider them adequate for the price I paid but I would not order these sheets again.
3,"Not bad, for the price","I purchased these sheets for a week long vacation where we needed king sized sheets for the bed. They were comfortable to sleep on, although a little on the warm side as microfober doesn't breathe like cotton. My biggest complaint was that the fitted sheet kept coming looose, but I can't say for sure if that was the bed or the sheets. Anyhow, for a week they were fine. Not for long term use, though."
2,Pay more get more,"Not the best sheet experience. My legs broke out in a rash. Best to wash before using, I guess. The thread count is a bit lacking, too. For microfiber sheets, I want a cloud-like surface. I will go for a higher priced item next time."
2,Short Top Sheet!,"I took the sheets out of the package when they arrived, washed them in cold water and dried them, as I normally would. The fitted sheet fit fine, but the top flat sheet was WAY TOO SHORT in length and in width. I have a 9"" deep mattress that's 61"" across (I just measured). When you add up both sides and the distance across it equals 79"". If the sheet is really 90"" there should be 5-1/2"" extra on each side. The sheet doesn't even drop down far enough to tuck in. I already threw away the packaging or I would return this sheet set. Disappointing."
2,Color All over,The quality of the fabric is good. But there was no warning that it should be washed before use as its color was coming off. All my cloths and pajama and the mattress now have a shade of red color in them. After the first wash now it seems to be ok.
3,"A little thin, stitching won't last ...","While these sheets are soft against the skin and pleasant to sleep on, they are pretty thin and the stitching just doesn't look like it is going to last. They'll be ok for a short while, but don't have the quality you normally expect with the term ""microfiber."" Still - for the price, not bad."
1,So thin they could be sheer curtains!,"When I got these I was amazed at how incredibly thin they are. They could easily be made into sheer curtains- they are that translucent. They are soft, but they do not fit the twin bed well and I am afraid that with one big foot shove they will rip......QUITE disappointed!"
4,Another great deal...,"I didn't know what microfiber was exactly. The sheets are thin and sheer. They look almost like silk but reflect so much heat they feel like flannel. These are at a perfect price and quality to stock up for guests', kids' and dorm rooms."
3,Pike Street Microfiber Sheet Set,"They are very pretty but not functional. We couldn't keep them on the bed, had to refit them every morning. I wouldn't buy them again."
2,Not Good,"My wife absolutely hates these. They came with a hole in one of the seams, they catch your skin and fingernails, they are see through thin, and now they are balling up. My wife made me take them to the thrift store after a week of sleeping in them! I do not recommend them. They are a beautiful purple color though."
1,Worst sheets ever!,"They are very, very thin. My set arrived with several stains and an overall ""soiled"" look. The pillow cases both had multiple holes. A thrift store wouldn't even bother selling sheets in this condition. At least Amazon's excellent customer service makes getting a refund a painless experience. Honestly, even if the sheets hadn't been ripped and dirty I don't know how anyone could rate these above 2 stars."
1,Cheap quality sheet,These sheets are horrible. They come off the mattress throughout the night and the quality is horrible. It is like sleeping on scrachy polyester.
2,Thinner than I expected!,"These sheets are very soft and silky but very, very thin. I decided not to use them on the bed but they made wonderful curtains! Not really what I'd call microfiber - they feel more like rayon."
1,What do you expect for $9?,"I don't know what I was thinking. I just wanted a pair of cheap sheets for the summer. I didn't realize that polyester sheets would be so hot. Also, I slipped around on the cheap fibers and the sheet didn't stay on my bed through the night (very low-quality elastic corners)."
3,took a chance,"The reviews are certainly mixed, and with understandable cause. I love how soft, silky and cool these sheets feel. But if you have a kitty... our cat's claws very easily get stuck in these sheets and has made them look somewhat ratty already. None of our other sheets have this problem. Additionally, they don't stay on the mattress real well. By morning the fitted sheet is almost coming up completely from under the mattress edge. So it seems the fitted sheet is somewhat too large and loose, the elastic corners and stitched edges not tight enough. But for under $10, I don't mind retucking my fitted sheet."
4,"Thin, they are...","...but a treat on my skin. After reading some of the reviews, I thought I'd purchased a bad product. When the sheets arrived, they were thin but fit my queen size bed just fine. It's the way they feel against the skin that's just incredible. When I washed them, there was no pilling and they still feel glorious. I'm back today and ordered 4 more sets!"
1,Very poor twin sheets,"Incredibly thin, in fact, I had no idea such sheets even existed. They are nearly transparent. They really feel like disposable sheets, but I assume that they will survive washing. I guess that is what the ""microfiber"" designation means. Luckily, the sheets are for a bed that gets used 2-3 times/year, so they will probably last for a while."
1,Very Disappointed,"I usually read the reviews before I purchase any item but I needed the sheets in a hurry and merely looked at the thread count and thought it would be okay. This is one of the very rare occasions when I was disappointed with a purchase I made on Amazon. The sheets are far too thin and it is true, they do not fit well. I purchased them for a twin bed and you really can see the mattress through the sheet. The only good thing about the sheet set is that it dries very quickly. I reside in the Caribbean and although the climate is warm these thin sheets are still not good for our beds here."
2,Not the best sheets I've ever had,"These sheets are very very thin and seem to collect snags every time you wash them. The bottom sheet does not fit; it is far too big and comes un-tucked constantly. I ened up having to sew each corner's gathers so that the sheet stays tucked. Just not the highest quality, but ok for the price."
1,Not very good quality - Don't waist your money!!,I purchased 2 sets of these sheets for my son's bed. The are so thin you can see through them and snag way too easily (not something desired with small children). Each time that I wash them they develop at least 1 new snag. They are also bigger than the sizes indicated. I purchased full size sheet sets and have a difficult time getting them to stay on the matteress. I'm glad I didn't pay more for them but do not think they are worth spending your money on. My rating F--- (I had to pick at least one star otherwise it would have received no stars)
1,too thin,"I wasn't familiar with ""microfiber"", only ""microfiber cotton"". These are very, very thin. Like sheer curtains. Again, ""you get what you pay for!"""
2,Inexpensive with a lot of static!,Not worth it honestly for the price. It was not what I thought it would be because I was hoping it'll be similar to 200-thread count. The fabric is like nylon and created a lot of static. I think it is good for sofas or futons and the burgundy is a nice color.
2,product of very bad warm,"product of very bad warm, the following day of their use, the product it was unstitched you don't leave the same as the picture"
1,Sheet set,Very unhappy with sheet set i hate them so much I wont even put them on bed Ill probably throw them away
2,the color is possibly the only good thing about these sheets.,"As many other reviewers noted, these sheets are very, very thin. You can see your mattress or mattress pad through the fitted sheet. And speaking of the fitted sheet, it's not very fitted. On my queen size mattress at least, it's several inches too wide, and ever so slightly too short. The extra width mitigates the lack of length, but i've still got extra material bunching up under me every night, and have to tug the corners down every few days to keep the sheet from popping off the head or foot of the bed.The only reason i'm giving this product two stars instead of one is that the ridiculously thin material is actually kinda nice on really, really hot humid summer nights. As soon as the temperature is reliably below 85 at night, these sheets will either get thrown in a box until next summer, or just thrown away."
2,No thank you,"I can't recommend them. They seemed to have a finish that clung to me when I rolled over and took the bottom sheet with me, they were so light weight they bunched up a LOT...cheap, color was gorgeous, but for me, not a pleasant sleeping experience, on their way to Goodwill."
2,Another bad review. Taupe set.,"I would agree these sheets are fairly soft, like 300 thread count sheets.Some kind of big issues though:1. One pillow case has a 3 inch opening where it looks like the sewing machine ""missed"". Should have been caught by quality control.2. The bottom side of the flat sheet(the side that is supposed to be against your body) is very rough polyester.3. The fitted sheet fit my 16"" deep pillow top very well. But was a much lighter shade of taupe. Noticeable.4. The pillow cases were two different shades of taupe. One was almost white! Even worse than the flat/fitted sheet difference. I can take a picture if anyone asks me to.5. The ""taupe"" in the picture is more of a brown/grey. The ""taupe"" I got is almost purple/lavender.Maybe my set was a reject, but I would not buy this brand again."
2,Cheap Sheets,"The sheets are what I should have expected for $25. The sheets are becoming worn after a few (less than 5) washes. I was looking for a good colored sheet, but I really should have gone for something in the 800+ thread count. The low price lured me in, don't let it happen to you."
1,"Wow these are REALLY bad, not even worth it","Wow, these sheets are horrible- felt like i was sleeping on a piece of rough plastic. the material used for the sheet and the pillow cases are very different- the pillow cases I don't mind so much except for the fact that they don't match the bottom sheet because they are made of different material, but the bottom sheet not only felt like plastic BUT it didn't even fit my king size bed properly.Bad design, bad material, bad deal. I highly NOT recommend this, unless you like the feel of plastic burlap on your skin."
2,Odd blue color,"These sheets are just okay for the price. They aren't really a light blue, more of a purplish blue and they are VERY thin. They are nice and soft though and will be good for summertime. Mine did get a couple of snags after the first wash since they are microfiber."
2,Microfiber sheets,"These are certainly ""micro"" fibers. They are thin, very thin. I will in the future be more careful in the thread count, which I don't remember seeing in their ad. Most sheets list thread count."
1,Horrid! Don't bother.,"These are going back to Amazon. They are thin, thin and do not feel nice at all. I didn't even unfold them all the way. They are so cheap that it was immediately apparent that I would never put these on my children's beds. Ugh."
1,see through sheets,sheets are too thin and some of the fibers were already torn when it arrive home. did not like it but for the price...
3,Good for the money,Not as sleek and soft as I was hoping for but awesome price and good for the money
2,MICROFIBER SHEET SET,"THE FIRST SET I RECEIVED HAD A BROWNISH RED SPOT ON THE TOP SHEET, SO I SENT THE WHOLE THING BACK. THEY SENT OUT ANOTHER SET & IT WAS FINE, EXCEPT IT WAS VERY FLIMSY & LIGHTWEIGHT. IF I HAD BEEN IN THE STORE TO PURCHASE SAME, I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THIS."
1,Cheap...read ALL the comments,"These ""sheets' were feel very cheap and you can see right through them. Was not happy about the quality at all. I ended up buying another set at Linen and Things.I should have read more comments. UGH!"
2,Not what I expected,"Very flimsy sheets - I have ordered Pike Street before, and was very pleased, but these are thin, uncomfortable. Even after washing, did not soften up. I would not recommend these at all. Two stars because of the price I paid, but you do get what you pay for!"
1,Worst Sheets Ever!,These sheets are very thin and you could almost see through them after a couple washings. They also got completely fuzzballed and worn away after only a few weeks of sleeping on them. The fitted sheet finally wore out and tore right in the middle. After only 5 months we had to throw them away. What a waste of money!
2,"Eh, they're ok","When I opened the product, the sheets really were soft. But when you're laying on them, they aren't very comfortable. I wouldn't buy another set again. But they were cheap, so not a horrible buy."
1,cheezy low quality,"I wish I hadn't wasted my money on these, they pilled up and are rough and uncomfortable."
1,Not so good,Sheets were untra thin but you get what you pay for and these were really cheap. I would not buy them again and do not recommend them.
1,not so great,they are super super thin and not sewn well at all. they were coming apart and dirty when i got them....would not recommend.
3,Not so Burgundy sheets!!,"The sheets and pillow cases are a good fit and the fabric is soft.We thought the colour (we are English, hence the spelling), would be stronger as the picture indicates but they are much lighter, more of a dark pinky which is misleading really.Nether the less, they were a wedding present and they fit in perfectly with our comforter and bedroom."
1,Will NEVER order these again,"These were the worse sheets I ever purchased, they did not fit properly. I now know you get what you pay for."
1,Horrible,The fitted sheet was sooo not fitted. I am constantly having to put it back on the bed after waking up with it at the foot of the bed. the material is already pilling after only a few weeks of use. Horrible horrible horrible. They are no longer soft. They look ready to be thrown out. A waste of my money.
3,Take a Shot - Worth the price,"I purchased 5 colors. The Burgundy - I don't think I got the correct product. The material was more of a satin/silky feel and more of a pink color not even close to the burgundy shown in the photo. The fitted King sheet was HUGE - possibly for a pillow top or a California King. The Hunter felt great and I was really looking forward to sleeping on that set - but the fitted sheet was too small (maybe a full or queen size). So after the 1st 2 sets not fitting I continued trying each of the fitted sheets on the bed. The yellow, plum, and blue all fit well - a little large for a standard King size bed. I like the material it feels more like a soft sheet than a crisp sheet. For the price - the sheets are a very good value so far - I have yet to wash them."
1,pike sheet set,the sheets are of low quality so thin you can see through them and after one wash they are covered with thise dreaded cotton balls
1,Don't let the price sucker you in...,"I ordered two sets, because hey, it's so cheap, right? Cheap is right. The colors were wonderful, very rich and the feel was great as well. But my joy soon ended after I made the bed. I thought I had purchased the wrong size, but after checking it three times, I had definately ordered the queen. It was strange because the sides of the fitted sheet seemed much too large for the mattress and when you get to the corners, they don't even fit over the mattress!!! I thought I was in the twilight zone. And after considering that maybe it was just a mistake by the factory, I put on the second set I ordered.... Same exact thing. After the cost of the sheet sets and the shipping, I had paid almost $50. I feel like Pike Street should pay me $50 plus an added $20 for my frustrations. Not worth the money or my time."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I purchased 3 sets at one time of these sheets because they sounded very nice and they were on sale, but after receiving them I have to say I'm Very disappointed in them. The quality is extremely poor, they are as thin as tissue paper with no substance, and the sizing is all off. I have a full size regular bed and that's what I ordered. The sheets I received say they're full size, but they're way too big for my bed and keep coming off at the corners every time I move around, yet they'd be way too small for a queen bed. They're just a very inferior product and I will never buy anything from Pike again."
2,Don't stay put,"These sheets feel nice, and they look nice. However, if you move around a bit while you are sleeping, these sheets will end up at the foot of your bed. They are so thin and so lightweight, they might as well not even be on the bed. I prefer a heavier sheet."
1,sheets,Very poor quality although it was very inexpensive. I guess I got what I payed for. I really thought I had found a great bargin. Not so at all.
2,"Very cheap, low quality -but comfortable","I bought this product because it was cheap and I figured how bad can it be, despite the numerous negative reviews. Upon receiving, I was instantly skeptical... the sheets are almost completely see-through... After washing, I noticed that there are numerous defects in the material in the pillow cases- like patches with lines where missing threads had been pulled out at some point in the manufacturing process. Basically what you would expect if these had been labled ""factory seconds"", which they were not...The redeeming quality is that the sheets do have the feel of silk at much lower cost-which is nice- just don't expect a high-quality sheet."
4,Cuddley,Hey very comfortable and will be back for the matching comforter so know the sheet set is a graet buy Top Notch!!!!!!!
1,Cheap and Flimsy,"I ordered these sheets and was terribly disappointed. The sheets are so thin, but worse of all, these sheets kept popping off the mattress. I found myself wrapped in the fitted sheet in the morning. They will not stay on the mattress and it is a full size mattress (not as if the mattress has deep pockets). Don't waste your money!"
1,Not great,These sheets feel nice but do not stay on the bed at all. They are also extremely hot thus making it hard to use them except on the coldest winter days. I will most likely not use them more than the once I did....waste of money.
3,Pike Street Sheets,"- Received on time and in good shape. Only problem they won't stay on the mattress, a bit too thinThanksMsladyjae"
1,Microfibre Sheets,I found the colors attractive but the fabric is thin and believe it or not for microfiber... scratchy. I returned these sheets immediately.
3,Good overall representation of game.,"The overall presentation of the game was given in a general manner however it is lacking certain specifics and details. When playing online, the manual does not offer any advice other than the most obvious to describe stratagy / tactics. Such was the day I was playing against a little nobody named ""KillSteve"". He was the worst player. He kept coming at me with individual troops as opposed to having his men in tanks! The book does not address these types of stratagies. Or stratagies such as dealing with opponents who decide to SNIPE instead of fight it out like a man (Airjesus, descartes). Talk about lowly. Luckily, the book covers general enough topics that place you in the sort of scenarion that you can deal with unruly online players and squash them accordingly, such as I did."
5,Disney's Mega Movie Mix,This is a great soundtrck it's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
3,Not so good songs.,Why not mcmix 6/10 Hilary Duff CAN'T sing.Can't help falling in love 8/10Dig it 6/10 not my type of songDrama queen [that girl] 9/10 Go Lindsey!Grazing in the grass 7/10Happy togeather 10/10 It rocks!Cinderella 8/10Supergirl 9/10Beauty and the beast 9/10Ultimate 10/10 The music from Freaky Friday rocks!Keepin it real 4/10 Terrible song and singer.Superstition 7/10 Not badwelcome 6/10Miricles happen 7/10

2,not a sleeper just sleepy,"My wife and I just couldn't get interested in it, I'm probably being harsh when I say it went from a B rated movie to a C rated movie quickly. I stopped watching it and moved on to another movie."
4,"Christopher Golden is a Rare Talent, & Strangewood is a Gem!","This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I trust her opinion. I ordered it the same day she told me about it, and read it the same day I received it. It's unique, excellent, and well crafted. Christopher Golden is a rare talent. He has the ability to put you into a situation in such a way that you almost feel you are THERE, walking with his characters. And sometimes that can be scary. Although there were a few moments where a note fell flat (the truth of the Peanut Butter General....and his ultimate ULTIMATE fate being the biggest), this book was still one of the best I'd read in years. It's a keeper, which I'll reread several times in the future."
3,A Good Halloween Read,I'm a big fan of Mr. Golden and found this to be a solid if predictable short story. It's the perfect little nugget for the Halloween season.
2,Strange Chris,"Christopher Golden is an odd one. I don't think there's an author out there with better premises for books than he but when you get into the heart of the story you find that he's done nothing creative with it. If throwing one odd thing after another at you is creativity, sign me up. Strangewood could have been such an awesome book but instead it's a mess. The story's potential for excellence declines the further you trod into it. The characters are shallow cliches and the conclusion is predictable. All of the books I've read by Golden are the same. Great ideas written badly. I want to give him another chance. I think he has potential but...I just don't know if I can waste my time and money on this author anymore."
1,I have never received my book!,I have purchased this book but I have never received it. You have lost my stuff and now I have not got my money back!
3,good film Bad dubbing,This is a good film.Unfortunately this version lost a lot of its original charm due to the fact that it is not wide screen and MAINLY due to bad dubbing.In the japanese version CHIBA SHINICHI (turned SONNY CHIBA)plays a rather ferocious Tacuma TsurugiIn this version Sonny Chiba plays Terry(/) Tsurugi who sounds like a cartoon character.There are translation errors.For example the karate style of the DA Officer is from Okinawa not Korea!The new format and sound do not allow you to really appreciate the kata the DA officer performs to show Tacuma his karate style. To dub this film may have been comercially sound.However it was very unfortunate for the film.I believe japanese films should always be subtitled.Karate and Samurai films often became ridiculous when dubbed.Ridiculous Not funny
3,This may not be Uncut,"I am trying to find out if this movie is edited or not. I heard that Street Fighters Last Revenge was the only one of the trilogy that has not been released in the US uncut. I was wondering if this region 1 version is uncut or what I heard was true? In the uncut version, Chiba rips out a mans still beating heart. I bought a Street Fighter Box Set and the only movie that was edited was this one. It contained an edited version of that scene. Comment on my review if you know if there is a region 1 unedited version I can buy. I know the region 2 box set has it uncut but I am looking for a region 1."
2,Chiba kicks ... and takes names pt. 3,"The third insallmenet in the Street Fighter trilogy has the best plot yet. A gang of mobsters wants a formula for synthetic hieroin. The gang double crosses Terry (big mistake), murders his girlfriend(bigger mistake) and fails to kill him(biggest mistake). So as expected Terry goes after them and gets his revenge. The gang realizes too late it is bad for one's health to ... off Terry Tsurugi. I liked the action even though I had a pretty good idea what was going to happen after they killed his girlfriend. The action was cool and brutal. I recomend this as well as the first two, Street Fighter and Return of the Street Fighter, wheather you are a fan of Bruce Lee or Sonny Chiba."
2,BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER ''SISTER STREET FIGHTER'',"IN THE FINAL MOVIE OF THE ''STREET FIGHTER'' SERIES, SONNY CHIBA RETURNS AS TERRY SURUGI TO PROTECT A SET OF TAPES THAT CONTAINS A FORMULA FOR MAKING HEROIN. BUT A DRUG CARTEL ALSO WANTS THOSE TAPES, AND THEY'LL STOP AT NOTHING TO GET THEM. BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER ''SISTER STREETFIGHTER'', THAT'S THE ONLY GOOD THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS FINALE. THOUGH THERE ARE STILL GOOD FIGHTS, THE STORY IS WEAK, SONNY'S CHARACTER HAS GOTTEN SOFT, AND IT'S TOO SLOW MOVING AT TIMES. WELL, IN MY OPINION, SONNY CHIBA DESERVED A MUCH BETTER WAY TO GO OUT IN THE LAST MOVIE OF THE SERIES THAT HE WILL BE REMEMBERED MOST FOR."
2,Ask Questions Before You Make a Purchase,"In spite of owning the ""Cornholio Doll"" that is epic and reminiscent of one of my favorite cartoons of all-time, I am very upset and disappointed with the quality of the box it came in. I was expecting a mint condition quality doll as advertised, but when I received the doll, the bottom part of the box that reads ""HEAD KNOCKER"" is torn in a way that some inconsiderate person must have grabbed it from that part and ripped it.So before you purchase anything, especially something you want to collect as memorabilia, you have to ask if there are any flaws to the box or its content. I would have asked for a refund or an exchange, but I didn't want to go through the process of USPS or any of that garbage.Don't be scared to ask, otherwise you might end-up like me upset with the quality of you item."
3,Very High Key,"I was disappointed with this music book because the songs were all so high. I have the Broadway Revival CD with Christina Applegate, and all of the songs are in a nice, low belt key on that CD, which is why I bought it. However, in the book they are much more soprano than alto. It must be the original keys, but I was still disappointed."
4,"5 star album, 3 star issue=4 stars","This album was the 1973 follow-up to '72's epochal ""Clube Da Esquina."" It's a brave, integrity-filled move that doesn't attempt to duplicate ""CDE"" in the least. Emotion-filled and at times a bit creepy, it features wordless vocals and sound effects in lieu of lyrics, most of which were banned by the military dictator schmucks then in power in Brazil. This reissue has a different cover than the original and inferior sound, but the great, proper Abbey Road-remastered version seems to be out of print (EMI, what are you DOING! ). Nevertheless, this is an important work that deserves to be heard one way or another. Musically, it's nothing like you might expect, it's a work you need to set aside some time to absorb properly. Its riches will reveal themselves to you eventually, and you'll then embark on a mission to track down the good CD version of this, which even reproduces the lavish packaging of the original. This is music as deep and wide as the ocean..."
1,Do Not Buy This!,This product was a perfect fit for the board that I own. The problem is that metal eyelets that hook into the board to hold it tight at the fat end tore throught he material. I compared this cover to the old one. The material this cover is constructed of is not nearly as strong as the original cover. It was in the trash less than 30 minutes after opening. I'm not wasting my time returning it. I'll just take it in the shorts on this one. Proper replacement covers for these boards are hard to find. I'm just getting a new one.
5,Love my iron board cover,Loved the iron board cover ! Excellent quality ! Shipped fast ! The price was right ! Thanks so much !
2,Not the quality expected,Although appeared to be best available product for O.T.D. ironing board cover did not fit as it should.Grommets were misplaced. Fabric was not adequate width for board and elastic insufficient to hold tight to edges.
5,ironing board cover,"this board cover is a very nice product, I would suggest this to my friends. it is very good quality."
2,Not as advertised on the package,"The packaging says ""extra-thick fiber pad"", but it is very thin and not enough. The package also says ""stitched elastic for snug fit"", but the one I received had no elastic at all. There was nothing to keep the rounded end of the cover in place, so it was pretty useless as received. I ended up buying some ironing board cover fasteners from a local store to make it work. It's not the greatest, but better than nothing and it was easier for me to do this than to return it. I uploaded pictures in the product description to show how mine turned out. I kept the padding out of my old cover that had elastic, as you can see in my picture."
1,ironing board cover,"i ordered this product as I have a Homz wall hung ironing board. I measured the board and the cover was supposedly the one that would fit. However, it did not fit. It was too short and because it was elastized, i couldn't stretch it to the end./ The return policy from this supplier was complex. It said you could not get a refund if you opened the package. Don't know how you are supposed to try this cover without opening the package plus they would charge you a repacking fee.I will not recommend this supplier and will not order from them again."
2,over the door cover for ironing board,"Very upset regarding the quality of this product. The foam attached to the cover is not thick enough, therefore you get the impression of the ironing board on your clothes as you iron. The cover is not wide enough for the board therefore it keeps slipping off. I purchased 2 of them, since I do iron a lot. I would really like to return the one I have not used and buy from someone else."
5,Question,"I have this document which was given to me by Len himself... he signed it as well. Does that increase the value? Excellent read, would recommend it to everyone interested in UFOLOGY."
2,History of American Bandstand,"This review is only for the 'Fifties and 'Sixties chapters of the book.The pictures from the TV Show, ""American Bandstand,"" and the lists of hits from each decade are the redeeming qualities of this book. The sycophantic Dick-Clark-as-God writing grows intolerable very quickly.The pictures are wonderful, especially in countering the bogus ""Grease"" idea of 'Fifties teen clothing. The kids on Bandstand influenced fashions all over the USA in the 1950s and 1960s. The lists of songs at the end of each chapter, devoted to the decade just covered, are wonderful for nostalgia buffs. The text, however, is another matter. I was unable to finish reading the book."
4,Excellent Book! Facts are inacurate here & there,I bought this book because I found out I was in there. I love the pictures but it was a bit inacurate! I tried to find the author so I could give him a handfull of names as I find myself in this book 3 places. I could never find Michael Schore
3,Great Plot but dragged On - *BIG spoiler alert*,"First what I love: The characters. Both Abigail and the elder Mr. Calverleigh are not the norm and I love them for that. I also, as another reader appreciated, loved that they fell love early and throughout the book were fond of eachother.I loved their meeting after being apart.I did like also how the author put the part of him getting the girl in London to trick his young nephew AFTER she had already arrived in Bath to give you a bit of a surprise when you did catch on...BUT I did feel that it dragged on in parts that it didn't need to. The book could have been much shorter and just as good I feel. It would have made for a faster read but still satisfying. It took a while to get started getting all the facts and setting in and at other parts just seemed a bit boring.good but slow 3.5 stars"
5,One of the best writers ever,I love the writings of Georgette Heyer and reread her books often! Her style is wonderful. Wish she wrote more!
5,Black Sheep,"Black Sheep has become more a favorite as I've grown older! I've purchased all of Georgette Heyer's novels on my Kindle. I have hardbacks in my personal library too! She is my all time favorite historical romance author. I especially like the Regency and Georgian romances, but never could get 'into' her mysteries.I read them every year or so and they never lose their charm. Discovered Georgette in my mid 20s and am now approaching 60, so I'm a dedicated fan!"
2,not one of her best,"Mostly wanted to just leave a rating rather than a review.I have read many GH books and, for me, this was just not one of her better stories."
4,Not bad,"IOC's Machines are us has many good points. The first of these is that the music is incredibly good at conveying the atmosphere (that of a cyberpunk Gibsonesque techno-hell) and the sound is slightly harsher in tone than their first album, Serenity Is The Devil.However, their music can get too repetitive and simplistic, and I would hope that LaPlegula and entourage can fix that up before their next album. Finally, the lyrics stick out too much and really damage the songs, and the lyrics are AWFUL.Furthermore, there are only a few standout tracks, although these are spectacular. Remove/Replace, Existence In Progress and Transfer: Complete are all excellent floor-packing stompfests.Overall, this Album is quite good, and a stylistic improvement. If they can execute the sound of Machines Are Us with the consistency of their debut (Serenity Is The Devil) than I would be a happy freak indeed."
3,Hmm...,while i emjoy this cd there is just something i dont like about it. i like android and sleepless the most... but the rest of the tracks dont seem to really impress me. i mean it's good music.. but to me it just seems too much like their other cds.. not much change. while some people might enjoy that.. i dont. i like change. this is a good cd no doubt.. but if you've heard their first 2 cds then you've heard this one already
5,Give them slack,"Yes, the lyrics may be cheesy at times but I think the beats make up for it all. Give them some slack. I personally think what they have is great, but could be improved. I never really knew much of Icon of Coil's work but when I got this cd I couldn't stop listening to it. I like the whole ""machines"" theme, even though it probably isn't the most original thing in the world. Then again lots of things these days isn't. Actually, the cd quite often reminds me of the movie Blade Runner... which is a nice plus. I don't know if it reminds anyone of the same thing. I have to say hearing this cd makes me want to check out their other cds. If they were to go on tour, I'd be right there."
2,predictable,"This cd is exactly like the last two. Nothing innovative what so ever. Your basic generic sounding programming and no musicianship skills. Most groups atleast have fundementals. Maybe icon does too but I cant hear them. Icon continue to follow the rest. They just dont have anything interesting lyricaly where as VNV, Assemblage23, etc really have a story behind their words. Icon is all about power on the dance floor. Not to say this cd wont get you dancing, but it also keeps Icon of Coil way out of range in this genre. A perfect example of technology overpowering the imagination. Perfect title for this album atleast."
3,One great song anyways.,"The song ""Shelter"" is awesome!!! Make that way, way, way, way awesome! Other than that...this is pretty much just another run of the mill futurepop/synthpop/industrial dance CD that you've herad before a thousand times. Still, one great song that makes the whole album worth owning."
4,IoC's best work,"This was actually the first Icon CD I bought, and I really liked it, so I got Serenity is the Devil and The Soul is in the Software. I was very disappointed with The Soul is in the Software...Like the other reviewers have stated, it was very linear, unimaginative, and left a very bland taste in my mouth. Serenity is the Devil was better, but I didn't find it to be anything to get excited about. Machines Are Us is head and shoulders above IoC's previous work, with more creative sounds, better rhythms, and far better lyrics, although they could still use improvement. ""Remove/Replace"" makes a great opening and is probably my favorite Icon of Coil song. Other standout songs on this CD include ""Shelter,"" ""Dead Enough For Life,"" ""Wiretrip,"" and ""Pursuit.""If you're an EBM or dance music fan, you will probably like this CD. I recommend it."
1,dose not state a .45 replica thought it was a deal,"I was shopping for a costume prop and thought I was getting a great deal, all the other light sabers on the page had .45 replica in the write up and, this one was miss identified, by not having it, and now I have no light saber for my cosplay outfit."
4,Mini saber,Was really cool collectable for an adult. my son wanted it but was a little dismayed over its size. I found it to be very lifelike in its scale size.
4,"The saber is from Empire, not Star Wars","They should advertise this as Luke's lightsaber from Empire. It says it is from Star Wars, which might lead someone to believe it is from A NEW HOPE. It's not. It's from Empire."
4,easy to use client,"Gardner describes the basic idea behind BitTorrent. How someone downloading runs a BitTorrent client that can in turn upload portions of a file to another client. This is the distinguishing characteristic of the network, as realised by Bram Cohen.You can see from the book that the client is easy to obtain from various websites, and easy to set up and run. The etiquette is that if you download a file, that you should keep your client connected to the net. So that it can answer quests from others. Which is probably how you were able to quickly get the file in the first place.While the book advises that you should not download copyrighted material like movies, one has to wonder how many readers will actually desist."
2,Too weird to wear.,"I love artsy, interesting, non-mainstream jewelry, and this fits the bill. However, this piece is too weird to wear. The pin is designed so the enameled ""back"" of the ladybug (although I'm convinced it's a ""misterbug"" it's facial features are masculine), faces forward, this would be ok, as it is the enameled and colorful part of the pin - however there is a big hole going through misterbug's head - meant for a necklace or cord. So when you wear it as a necklace, the pin is facing forward. Not the best design, as no matter how you wear it, it looks like it might be on backwards."
5,Fantastic!!,"I got this toy for my 4 year old daughter. It is great it comes with twistable crayons (perfect for those of us that hate the million broken crayons in our childs crayon box), markers and three stamp markers. The stamps do not stamp perfectly but that hasn't stopped my daughter from putting a smiley face stamp on all her art work. The map pencils aren't her favorite to color with, but she loves to write in all different colors. It is great to take on the go and holds everything perfectly in place. I feel that it is an absolutely great buy."
4,Use this in the WAVES!!!!!!!!!!,"The wave is sooooooooooo cool. It's just nott educational. I gave it one star because it doesn't help you if you wanted your child to be an artist. If you wanted your child to be an artist, I would say get them a sketch pad and a 96 box of crayons and say draw,baby draw! ENJOY@"
5,good movie,"I actually bought this for just ""Hello Again."" It's an awesome movie. I haven't indulged in the other movies on this order but will."
5,A Couple Of 5 Star Films,"Jim Belushi in Taking Care Of Business is veryfunny. If you want to be entertained thencheck out this film, It's not Oscar perfomances just good entertainment. Same goes for Hello again. Shelly Long always plays interesting characters and brings lots of laughter."
3,2 out of 3,"The 2 movies were funny.Hello Again was not funny, that movie was boring and stunk. The other 2 were good."
1,displeased customer,I used the book for only one month for a summer class yet the binder wasnt so good that i noticed the book wasnt binded together tightly. I would recommend for the distributor and publishing house to take a close look at every books in as far as the quality of the finished product is concerned - before selling it in the market!Im not happy with the purchase...
4,It's a textbook...what can I say?,It was nice to find this textbook online at Amazon for a better price than in the campus bookstore.
2,Poor handling,Coax seemed OK but the coil had several kinks making it unuseable except for patch cords. Kinks destroy the characteristic cable impedance.
3,Nice,"I heard a lot about this film. Wanted to support it when it was still on the film festival circuit. Well acted, good storyline. Well worth the investment."
4,Good Film,this film is really cool.it takes you behind scenes of a Show from the Writer&Producer Perspective.this Film&Bamboozled have alot in common.the sad Part not much has realy changed with how Hollywood acknowledges the Diversity in Black life on TV.it's still the Same Ole Same ole overall.this film deals with alot of issues head on.Props to the cast.
4,Good Movie! I'll give it a play!,"This movie is kind of funny when he said the line ""You gotta Keep it Real!"" This movie deals with drama about a kid who came from the gutta and some lady who is a writer picks him up and he becames a star so he will have enough money to feed his babygirl. His parents dissowned him, and his girlfreind dump him for a no good street punk, so this kid tries to make it right for himself and make it right for his babygirl! And also a writer falls in love with a producer as they continued to work on the TV show called ""Just US."" But as you know tragedy and dissapointments will always come in between them. But the movie was good and it is worth seeing! It's simuliar to the other movie ""Bamboozeled!"" Thanks Amazon!De'Vear SmallAKA Dee SmallsRepresenting Decatur, GA"
5,Great for my camper building project,We are in the process of building a custom camper and this is a great little sink. Its a nice size for what I need and looks nice and quality built. I am sure it will hold up for many years. No surprises its exactly what I was looking for.
5,Double Fun,"Identical twins Bert and Nan Tatum are used to being mistaken for each other. So when a stranger approaches Bert on the street, she assumes the stranger is looking for Nan. Only later does she find out that Nan didn't know him either. By that point, he's dead. Nan, curious as to how a complete stranger knew them, drags Bert into the investigation. But it's soon clear that they are both in real danger and the only way to get out alive is to solve the case themselves.This book is a lot of fun. The ""gimmick"" of alternating chapters from Bert and Nan is part of it. It took me awhile to get used to it, but it brings out the humor in the different points of view. The authors, identical twins themselves, have done a good job of creating very great characters. Nan and Bert are very different, and the other characters are also well defined. The plot moves along at a quick pace and reaches a logical conclusion. A great first novel in an enjoyable series."
4,The Tale Of One Small Location In A Nation's Greater History,"A good book about an easily overlooked microcosmic place in the English landscape, and all that transpires there over many centuries from pre-history to Elizabethan times. A dense story unfolds here but not a heavy one. This book should have gotten more critical attention and sales than it did, because it's worthy to be among some of the more well known titles in the fictional history genre."
4,The Enchanted Island,Nice interesting fantasy. I enjoyed it. I think kids ages ten thru fourteen would like this book if they like fantasy stories.
3,ok for the money,"This violin is quite striking to look at but it's not great quality. I have a problem with strings not fitting precisely well etc. I gave it 3 stars cause it's sort of a get what you pay for kind of thing. It is a violin and it does work, and well it's ok for beginners I suppose but for more experienced players i would recommend paying for something better. The picture here doesn't do justice to the look of the real thing though."
4,Violinsmart,"I liked the violin but the only thing I did not like was how horrible the strings sound. I love that the violin played but the strings, even when tuned sound horrible-tho its like 5 to ten buck to get very good strings. Another thing is the chin rest. I had to buy a new one because the one it came with was not comfortable and it does not come with a cloth to clean it. I like the violin and have played line when I was 9 and since I am now 22 I wanted to play again and this is a great beginners violin."
1,A very poor VCR!,"When I first bought it, it said that it played VHS tapes great, but when I got it home, it became a nightmare. The Mono sound was poor and the picture wasn't too great, I mean $39.87 should be enough for a great VCR. Well, I plan on taking it back and getting a refund, so I can get a different VCR like a MAGNAVOX."
1,"Good at first, then Junk!","Two years ago, I purchased this VCR, at first it worked great, then during playback their is gray streaks on the screen, it lookes like a pause on a two-head vcr, then when I would insert a cassete it seats halfway in the machine, I had to wiggle it to go in all the way. A year ago my GrandMother gave me her Emerson DVD/VCR combo that workes great. As soon as I got it I threw this VCR out with Bulk trash, stay away from this VCR its too cheap."
5,can't live without it!!,"this is a great little pocket knife. I put this in my pocket everyday. great little knife to have at your fingertips.I recently had my original one confiscated at airport security because I forgot it was in my pocket, and had to give it up at security.When I returned home, I missed it so much that I had to search out another one. Luckily I found it on Amazon! Oh did I forget to say that it is a bottle opener...maybe that is why I missed it so much!"
4,Great Concert DVD,"I love Tsunami Bomb and they're great in this dvd, they play all the songs that I love. I'm happy with my purchase."
4,To add to what I said before,"The NWO was cool at first but the angle dragged on for so long. At least Nash broke away from the NWO and formed the Wolfpac. I guess that I'm not a fan of celebrities actually wrestling in matches, and seeing Dennis Rodman, Karl Malone, and Jay Leno attempting to wrestle was horrendous to watch. Granted it was kind of cool seeing Malone body slamming Hogan, so out of those three Malone proved to at least have some skill. As I said, it covers the highlights of the NWO from the beginning to January of 1999."
4,La biografia del grupo que mas revolucionó la lucha libre!!,"Es un gran video para cualquier fanatico de la nWo, el unico problema es que es muy corto, ya que no te pueden dar en 1 hora la biografia de un grupo que lleva 3 años en la lucha libre.... contiene entrevistas nunca antes vistas y es narrado por Eric Bischoff. Buen video, ya era hora de que le hisieran un video al grupo mas legendario de la historia de la lucha libre!!..... nWo 4 life!!!"
3,Pretty Good,"I do not really like the NWO. This video is a good video for NWO fans. It outlines the entire NWO story, from how they started to present. nWo 4 Life."
4,THE REIGN OF THE NWO,"THE HULKSTER GOIN TO THE DARKSIDE IS SOMETHING UNFORGETTABLE.FORMATOIN OF THE NWO WAS THE BEST THING THAT HAPPEN IN WRESTLING. IT WAS NOT 3 PEOPLE BUT A WHOLE POSSE OF THEM WALKIN AROUND AND TAKEN OVER. A GANG THAT TOOK EVERYTHING AND WON ALMOST EVERY MATCH. THEY WERE COOL. IT WAS A GREAT TIME TO BE A FAN.HOGAN LEADIING THE WAY IN TOTAL DESTRUCTION.UNFORGETTABLE TIME,ESPECAILLY WHEN STING SHOWED UP AND BECAME A HERO.IT DIDNT MATTER BECAUSE THE NWO WAS JUST TOO SWEET..OH YEAH THE NWO WOLFPAK WERE ALSO A GOOD ALLIANCE ,AWESOME. I HOPE THIS FORMATION HAPPENS AGAIN WITH DIFF. WRESTLERS. WHEN YOUR NWO YOUR NWO FOR LIFE!!!!!GET THIS TAPE."
4,Christian Swing Dance 101,"Great Swing tunes for East Coast Swing, Lindy Hop, and Jitterbug. A must have for Christian Swing Dancers. Check out The Christian Social Dance Association at http://christiansocialdance.org"
2,Girls 5 & 7 - Disappointed,"I was so excited getting this for my 2 girls that are 5 & 7. They love crafts. Anything to do with drawing, coloring, etc. But, the dry erase portion of this item doesn't come clean well at all. The first time they drew on it with the Dry Erase markers, it hardly wiped off. They lost interest in it pretty quickly after that. I paid only $28.00 for it on sale.. and am still a bit disappointed with my purchase."
1,Guidecraft 4-in-1 Flipping tabletop Easel - Returned,"This item arrived at our home in extremely bad condition. The easel board was cracked, one peg was busted and the rest of the parts were missing. With only 2 weeks before Christmas we had to return it for our money back and go out to get our grandson another gift. This was the first time I was displeased with items I bought on line."
