2,Didn't have the umph to start my Forester,"I love the tire guage and how quickly it inflates tires for how small it is. I use it for the bikes every spring. It did start my mom's Camry once. I charged it to 3 lights, let it charge for two more hours, and it was still on 3. I tried to start the car, thoroughly. No start. I let it charge for 3 more hours: it went from 2 lights to 3. I tried it again. CICKLICKLICKLICK. Had to use my mom's Camry to jump start properly. I also had another B&D unit (older, no lighter outlet) not take a charge after 5 uses and two years (I kept/keep it at 60-80% charge for storage). Frankly, I won't buy another B&D for emergency starts. It's cheaper to park at the top of a hill."
4,B & D Battery Pack,"I haven't had to use it yet, but it looks like it's easy to use. I've had good luck with B &D products that's why I bought that brand."
1,Lasted just over a year then Dead,"I used it to jump start a few vehicles and a riding tractor. I've also used the inflator.... all as expected. When I went to check battery level before this weekend's snow storm, it showed little charge left. Immediately when I plugged in the charger, it fizzled and popped in my outlet and showed the unit being fully charged.Unfortunately, into the trash this unit goes. The plug-in charger runs $30 and a new one of these units goes for $60. I did the math, and I'm looking for a better replacement now..."
1,arrived damaged,this item arrived on time but with the plastic casing cracked. Package showed no outer damage. I must have been sent a faulty/damaged item. This item also has no 12v outlet that you can plug items into. Very disappointed and because it is considered 'hazardous material' I can't return it to Amazon. A waste of $80+.
2,Compressor Quit after only 8 months,"Don't buy this Vector jump-start compressor. The compressor quit after less than 9 months, Amazon will not take it back, and there is NO customer service from the manufacturer. After several days of trying to contact Vector I gave up and am going to a retailer that will take the product back if it breaks. Amazon is fine for buying some things (like books), but anything mechanical that could break I'm going to buy at a retailer from this point forward due to Amazon's terrible returns policy on many of their products."
1,Not as pictured!,The model # matches the advertisment but the unit I received did not have the 12 volt plug in outlet.
3,Good backup,"It does what it says it would, but I was dissapointed it had no outlets to power other items. The last one I had was smaller but also had two cigaret lighters built in, but it broke. My fault for not researching well enough. This a problen when buying on line. Don't assume anything. Nothing wrong with the product, its fine."
2,Mediocre,"Pretty much, the battery option died after the first 45-60 days despite meticulously following the charging instructions. More specifically, it fails to hold a charge much longer than a few days while kept in a trunk starting around that time frame. As a tire inflator, it works fine as long as it's charged. Today, after about 2 years of ownership, the inflator finally died too just a few moments ago. Perhaps that's considered a good run and perhaps not. I'd intended it for the convenience of not having to go to a gas station for the usual guy-routine tire checks.Black & Decker is not the product it was 20+ years ago."
5,B&D Start It,I have used this product several time to start cars at work. Very good results. The air pump works good also. Easy to carry behind my seat in my pickup. The charge stays good for 60 to 90 days. I would recommend it highly.Donnie Mc
3,Almost an excellent product,"As a battery jumper and a portable cigarette-lighter power supply this thing rocks. But the air pump does not have an automatic shut-off (based on a pre-selected pressure). Plus the size of the air-outlet is slightly too small so you have to really shove it on your tire tube valve. I was thinking about machining the hole out a little bit so it was more user friendly in this regard, but instead I now just use it as a portable battery for a SEPARATE 12V air pump. And the air pump I do use does have an auto-shut off, so all is good. 2 devices instead of 1, but oh well....."
4,"Works great, but...","It is easy to loose the charging adapters, because there is no storage space in the unit. This unit is actually made by Vector and they supply a carrying case with it which will most likely fit the adapters.Works great otherwise. I like the mini compressor and it has helped me out in the past. One this missing is the alternator voltage check. The more expesive models that do have this feature, don't have the compressor."
3,No 12-volt DC outlet,The product I received didn't include the 12-volt accessory outlet. I consider this an important feature so I returned it.
4,A perfect gift,Product was received in great condition. My father-in-law loved this simple gift so much. It is a good quality stone and smooth shape.
5,Great kitchen product,"This is being used for a lot of small grinding jobs in the kitchen, mainly herbs and other dry items. Works so well and is used so often that I've removed it from the cabinet and placed it in a prominent place on the counter. Very happy with it.Might also add that this is solid marble, not fake."
5,Perfect,The set is very attractive. Nice weight. Will enjoy using this. Pretty enough to leave on the counter for everyone to see.
3,Lovely product but pestle arrived broken,Exactly what I was looking for however pestle arrived broken. Packaging was still in perfect condition so I`m guessing some of the other reviews commenting that the product is not durable hold true.
2,Too Fragile,"Gosh, it's pretty, and I was oh so excited to get this delivery...only to pick up the box and hear the obviously broken product rattling around inside. If it can't even be delivered in once piece, how is it going to survive its intended use of putting pressure on and smashing things? Perhaps if Amazon would have offered a replacement instead of refund only (even though it's Prime) I would have tried another, but alas. I guess I'm going to go with the old standard, sturdy white ceramic one instead. =("
4,Nice beginning mortar and pestle,"You'll like this mortar and pestle if you just plan to use it in the kitchen or for making herbal remedies. Be sure not to use acidic things like vinegar or lemon juice in anything made out of marble, such as this, or it will cause it to erode.The only complaints about this are that the felt pad on the bottom of the mortar will come off after a few washings. Also, don't use this with anything too hard -- it won't damage the mortar or pestle, but things like peppercorns aren't actually going to get crushed. They'll just pop out of the mortar when you try and smash them.Over time, the smooth grey marble at the bottom of the pestle and on the grinding surface of the mortar will wear away and look whitish. That's to be expected, and it will not mess up your ability to grind things in it. In fact, it will probably grind things better at that point.Final Verdict: A great value for $15-20. I would recommend this to a friend."
4,Beautifu Mortar and Pestle,This is a great size for grinding fresh or dried herbs. A bit pricey but worth the extra money.
3,Mortar,"Great product for grinding and smashing meds, I personally use it for medical reasons. Heavy and attractive. Good buy ."
2,Large mortar and pestal,"Did not fully appreciate the size and heft of this M&P by looking at the pictures and reviews. I knew it was big but it is even larger than that. What I really needed, and subsequently found at Macy's for $6.99, was a small fine grinding more of a sandpaper surface M&P. This one is so coarse with an unevenly surfaced mortar as to be difficult for me to use. I really should return it. While there is nothing particularly wrong with the product, it just doesn't suit my purpose and did I mention it is large and unwieldy."
3,it is fine,"we got the mortar & pestal, the pestal was broken when we got it. i call the compant right away after opening package. the rep at the company, said he'd send one out right away. we got a new pestal 3 days later. too bad it came broken in the first place. had the pestal been wrapped up in something, it wouldn't have broken...."
3,Christmas purchase,"Just what I wanted. On line it said it was in stock when I ordered, but I got an email 2 days later that it was actually on back order. I decided not to cancel the order and it arrived FedEx by the original expected shipping date."
5,"An excellent, well-conceived approach to programming logic.","Syntax only takes you so far. Without the logic, your program can produce garbage. Joyce Farrell has provided an essential tool to understanding programming logic through the use of flowcharts. By using this book, the future programmer will have a headstart in understanding the logic behind programming. Joyce has an easy-to-read style and she provides useful diagrams and explanations. I wouldn't take a course in any programming language without first reading this book!"
5,wonderful book for the student of esperanto,"This is a great book, which teaches you everything the basic studen tneeds to know about esperanto the international language. I have been studying fo ronly one year and already feel confident speaking, reading and writing it with people i do not know on the internet. For anyone considering learning this language i highly suggest it."
1,Not very good at all..,"The brine was overly sweetened and the product was just not good at all. There was nothing ""pickled"" about this product. It was just a sticky unpleasant tasting mess. I threw them out. I would not buy again nor would I recommend them to anyone."
5,A singularly thought-provoking commentary.,"Destination Torah: Reflections On The Weekly Torah Readings by Isaac S.D. Sassoon is a ""close reading"" of biblical verses in a commentary that regards faith and science as symbiotic. A carefully thought out analysis that examines every word of its chosen passages, Destination Torah strives to change self-perception and one's view of the world through its view of the Torah. A singularly thought-provoking commentary, Destination Torah is a welcome and recommended addition to the study of the Torah."
3,RNA Supplements,Husband has been taking these at the prescription of his nutritionist. They were prescribing standard process rna (pricey). Tried life extension because of price. He said they are smell awful and give him gas but do work as prescribed.Trying swanson premium brand.
2,not the best beginner book,"Not really the beginner book we thought it might be? Our little guy is 8 years old and is a very good reader, however the book was a little difficult for him to understand. It's ok if Mom or Dad are there to help but for a self starter book it is not. There are other books out there which use color coded keys or other methods to make it easier for the young minds to understand. This is a good book but it is not the ""Easiest"" piano course book.TonyRedwood City, CA"
4,pH Testing Tape by Body Rescue,"It does what it supposed to do. Unfortunately for me though, it read my body as acidity in multiple attempts and my husband was 7.0 (nice for him), my was the lowest 5.5. I guess I have to eat more fruits and vegetables to get to a 7."
4,"Funny, Clever and Educational","This is a fine book. Educational, funny, clever and well-written.It will teach you plenty about rhetoric, while making you laugh. So it's doubly persuasive.Heinrichs' observations on American society are also well worth the read, as when, for example, he explains that Americans once loved banter, until, that is, classics and rhetoric fell out of favor in the 19th century.I will be re-reading this one.Thank you, Mr Heinrichs.Perhaps a sequel on the written word?"
2,Not helpful,"I started to read this book today after having it on my shelf for several months. The book is written in a very casual, easy-to-read format. However, I found that the organization and flow was not helping me learn anything about arguing effectively. I honestly think that the entire book could be condensed into maybe 1 or 2 blog posts, with more concrete examples and much less fluff."
2,Art of Persuasion in Complex Terms,"An interesting read but too complex in its terminology for my taste. By the time I got halfway through the book I just started going to the last page of each chapter to see what the summary had to say, because there was too much minutiae each chapter. For me, I liked the dialogues, as they helped me understand the concepts better. But in the end, I couldnt really find any nuggets to make this book worth my time. If you are looking for a book that takes the complex and make them simple - dont read this one. If you like the delving into entomology and ancient Greek culture in the context of persuasion, then this is the book for you. All you need is to read the first four chapters and then return it to the library."
3,Poor Examples,Far too many trivial examples. I could not believe someone would call their wife Dorothy Sr. and daughter Dorothy Jr.
1,Boring,THis book was a waste of money and time. Did not want to read about the author's life story. Just wanted to know about the various types of arguements
5,Great introduction to persuasion,"Jay has written a thoroughly enjoyable book that is not only informative, but funny. Many of the concepts Jay writes about I feel I was following naturally, but never saw written down so succinctly. It is good to know that other people enjoy the useful form of argument, the art of rhetoric, still. I feel that most people I meet these days shy away from a good old fashioned debate, just for the intellectual fun of it! My Italian wife was born and raised in this rhetorical way, and this book reminded me how lucky I am to be with someone who can argue, without fighting."
5,Never too late.,"My only regret in reading this book is that I wasn't able to so 40 years ago. I purchased the book as a high school graduation gift with the idea it would help my nephew be better able to distinguish the truth from some of the idiotic arguments he would hear during his college career. When i read it myself, my expectations were vastly exceeded. The author was witty, his instruction was very understandable and the usefullness of the study of rhetoric was made abundantly clear. It is almost criminal that rhetoric is not taught in high school as a required subject. it certainly should be taught to undergrads in universities.As for myself, I am already beginning to see the political arguments on TV from a rhetorical perspective. It isn't pretty. Highly recommend to anyone who needs to use persuasion in real life (that's 98% of people who really work). Now if only my nephew will read this............"
1,Boring and useless; who was this book written for? Not me.,"I'm not a linguist, historian or rhetorician. I'm an average Joe and I bought this book to learn about the nitty-gritty of arguments, negotiation and persuasion. I wanted to get better at these things for the benefit of my professional, social and personal life and I'm guessing plenty of other readers fit that description perfectly.What applies to you might not apply to me. But to *ME*, the book simply did not deliver.The book is chock-full of information but the style of writing, organization or presentation render it useless, and it's a very boring read to boot!"
1,Another Root Vegetable!!!,"I was intrigued by the title of this book, but my interest dwindledonce I actually opened it and began to peruse the chapters. In myopinion, the author's motivations are correct, but he fails to offerany new insights/perspectives on the braod topics that haven't alreadybeen beat to death by every other hot-shot litigator fresh out of somestarched-collar university.Don't get me wrong, there are some very interesting sections of thebook--woth taking a look at if you are truly interested in the topic,however, as a whole, the book can't seem to break it's myopic approachto persuasion--and that isn't very convincing.I think the cover should be re-drawn to include a radish on astring---it is still a root vegetable, but unlike the carrot, no oneever eats them!"
5,Keys to advertising and political campaigns,"The book not only shows how to argue, it also reveals the tricks behind advertising and political campaigns. Heinrichs walks us through the basic rhetorical principles, starting with ""ethos, pathos and logos,"" or character, emotion and logic. Character is the most important, he says, because your audience is much more likely to accept your point if it likes and trusts you. He shows how to construct the image of a leader to suit any audience--useful for anyone who manages people, or wants to."
2,Too simplistic,"I thought this book would be something really interesting to read, and provide more stimulus for inspiration and deeper thinking. After reading the Kindle sample, I was really disappointed with how it seemed to really simplify things down to just tricks you can use to win arguments (even though the author specifically says that arguments should not be about winning). Not really worth my time, and in my opinion only mildly useful even in business situations. It also had a tone of promoting a disingenuous attitude towards confrontation, which I whole heartedly do not believe is a good long term way to build respect and lasting relationships."
1,Lousy Shipping,"Was told when I ordered there would be a 3 day delay. Items were shipped 11 days (weekdays) later. Maybe even worse, they used a Priority Mail Box to ship via FedEx Home....If I wanted that kind of experience, I'd have bought them on eBay"
4,Great movie for kids!,"Great movie for kids! Funny and Silly! I came across this movie while browsing in Amazon, my son really enjoyed it."
2,Good CD But Track 3 a little out of place...,Nice compilation but track 3 is Nobody from Sylvia.Not Sylvia Robinson the soul singer and label head but the country singer Sylvia with her 1983 Country and AC hit Nobody.This song was never released to soul stations and never sniffed the soul charts.How did this song make it through quality control and wind up on a SOUL hits CD?? Somebody was asleep at the wheel and I'm sure glad they didn't make it on this CD either.
4,Not as good as Loch'd and Loaded,"McKenzie and Robertson weren't minding the store when this album was mixed. The highland pipes got put in the background instead of up front where they belong. Good stuff but not like Loch'd and Loaded where the pipes are the lead guitar. There's a zillion punk bands- no point in sounding like everyone else. Be different, be Scottish."
3,STU MEAT SAYS,"this is a decent album. musically awsome, vocals lack on some songs.i have seen them live wich is an amazing show, full on intensity. im going to check out some of thier other albums. this one was worth the 8 bucks i paid for it."
1,Not what it says it is!,"This is NOT an ink cartridge! This is just a Print Head! If you want ink, cross reference the model number with HP's web site for the proper item!"
3,Perfect Storm - Imperfect Blu-Ray disc..,"I enjoyed this movie in the theater and bought this Blu-Ray disc to see it in high definition. Unfortunately, the Audio on the disc box indicates Dolby Digital TrueHD 5.1. Even the Blu-ray disc menu shows TrueHD as an option, but it doesn't work! I use an Onkyo TX-SR605 receiver to playback the Hi-Def audio like TrueHD and dts-HD. The sound is a big improvement from regular Dolby Digital. For some reason, this option doesn't work with this disk. (Wonder if anyone else experienced this problem???)So, a four star movie gets only 3!"
3,Relationships in the modern world,"Written in 1977, this is the second book by Philip Roth featuring David Kepesh, here a young man who is starting his career as a literature professor. As he pursues different women in different continents, the question always in his mind is if he should settle for marriage and love or for sex without commitment. A side trip to Prague is not only a homage to Kafka but one of the best passages of the book. By the next installment of Kepesh in the Dying Animal, written almost a quarter century later, he is a man in his sixties, who has chosen to live without a commitment and therefore now feels lonely and vulnerable to young women. Roth's stream of consciousness style is sometimes infuriating but often illuminating about the conflict between love and desire after the sexual revolution. Reading Roth can help you develop a quite realistic understanding of many aspects of the contemporary world, even if you find such aspects quite appalling."
2,book purchase review,"This book arrived in good condition but was a library book complete with end page stamps, plastic unremovable cover, and a card envelope in the back endpaper. This was not as advertised and not at all welcome. I would not have purchased the book if I had known this was the case. No way to know that it wasn't stolen from the library."
3,Left out episode,"Disney left out an episode called ""No Mutant Is An Island"" in which Cyclops leaves the X-Men because of the loss of Jean and goes back to the orphanage where he grew up to find that a purple man is using mutant orphans to do his dirty work. Boom-boom, Tabitha Smith is one of these mutant children. Pretty careless Disney or is it a marketing ploy to rerelease volume 3. Not cool."
4,"Volume 3 X-men: Apocalypse, Dark Phoenix, Weapon X project","My earlier reviews comments were in error. This was a great volume an also a definite 4 stars. This volume, however, had greater storylines & short-comings. The Dark Phoenix Saga was both a huge triumph & an over dramatic short-coming. This saga had one of the most powerful creatures in Marvel history as well as X-men history, key battles between the X-men & Shiiar SF, but the drama took away from all of that probably because it is hard to make an animation as good as a comic. This volume did succeed in the Weapon X project & Apocalypse shorts with their only draw back being they were too short. Great overall volume with much more to offer than my current remarks but I rather leave some for the purchaser."
4,love the smell,"wish it weren't so pricey, but i love the meyer's line of fabric softener. smells nice, not some overwhelming perfume. use it in my front loader HE washer. a little goes a long way."
3,obsesión incomprendida,"No termino de comprender la obsesión, el amor que el narrador desarrolla por el barco protagonista. La prosa, estupenda, la narrativa, de primera clase, pero la motivación o las razones por las que el narrador se enamora del barco se me escapan. A lo mejor es que soy muy obtusa..."
4,Pulsar Two Tone,I bought this as a gift for my brother.. I currently own a pulsar and am generally satisfied with the brand.The watch definitely looks attractive.. and has a sturdy metallic feel to it.. Great deal for a chronograph model.. It is quite heavy so you should have large wrists to wear it.
2,soy sauce dispenser,Great size. Dispenses well. There is no cap or lid. If it falls over in the refridgerator(which mine did) what a mess!
1,Not sure what I got but it does not work,I bought this for my 2012 Wrangler and it does not fit the antenna or stereo. I have no clue what I was sent but I tossed the packaging and had to forgo listening to satellite/AM/FM.They probably sent me the wrong thing but I am just deciding to write something now.
3,Not the right one for my truck,"I ended up having to go to Best Buy to purchase the correct unit, this one didn't fit my 2008 Dodge Dakota."
1,Broken,Came in the mail broken. Very disappointed. I will probably try to purchase another online because the prices are so much cheaper than in store.
5,Perfect for Jeep 2008 Patriot,"Incredibly easy to install (took 1 minute after removing radio headset) and works perfectly in my 2008 Jeep Patriot. I do get some static on FM stations, but I think that is more of my antenna and car's fault as has been documented well for Patriots if you do a quick google search. I currently am using it with my Pioneer AVH-4300 and have also used it with an Pioneer AVH-4200, both of which it worked with perfectly fine."
1,Total Fluff,"This book is far too basic for anyone who graduated high school biology. It is redundant, condecending, and very poorly edited.Duarte's explanations of scientific/ medical concepts are painfully dumbed down. (Admitedly, I too I am a physician, but I think anyone with even a remote scientific background would agree.)Worse yet, much of the book is composed of generic and dated summaries of the major biopharma companies (not even an appropriate use of paper in the age of [investment websites]I was hoping to learn from this book fundamental priniciples for evaluating biotechnolgy companies from a seasoned wall street/ medicine hybrid. But Duarte gives too much general investement advice, and too little advice specific to biotechnology investing..."
1,Give this one a miss,"The book looks great, but it is definitely not worth reading. If you are into technical analysis, you may derive some use from the text. However, I don't see why you need a book devoted to biotech for investing on this basis.There's a weak chapter on the science (high school level at a stretch); a discussion on investment basics which misses the mark. The markets chapter is fine, but the review of major drug companies is weak. I just found the analysis of the biotech industry to be too weak. There's simply too little analysis and too much opinion.I have no idea why there's a discussion on mutual funds. Unless the particular vehicle is a sector fund, the manager won't start investing in biotech until the price has appreciated. By then, it's too late.The MD and CNBC credentials lead me to believe that this book would provide some dynamic insight or a systematic way for cutting through they hype. Sadly, it did neither."
5,great foundation for aspiring biotech investors,"This book provides the average investor with a solid foundation in their pursuit of successful biotech investing.Most investors invest in biotech stocks based on media exposure and momentum driven markets. There is a glaring lack of any sort of structure to their research or position management. Dr. Duarte's book lays the groundwork for investors to establish a workable system of identifying and managing promising investments. By incorporating risk management techniques (technical analysis), he has provided a dose of reality to balance the inherent optimism the motivates biotech investors. This is crucial as it prevents the blow ups that destroy portfolios as well as investor confidence."
1,This book is baloney.,"I saw this book at a family member's house and I decided I would give it a read. I found the lack of knowledge that the author displayed to be quite humorous. All the evidence the author and other creationists put up for creationism or against evolution has been completely dismantled by legitimate biologists. I recommend any book by Jerry Coyne, Richard Dawkins, or just about any other high profile evolutionary biologist. You will come out of their books laughing at yourself for actually having once taken creationism seriously."
3,Product seems okay.,"The PIAA locks just came today. Not sure how well they will actually work. It seems that a thief may now just leave the mounting brackets and take the lights. We shall see how useful the PIAA locks are as a theft deterent. Amazon & UPS lost the original order. Three phone calls is all it took two days after the original delivery date. Then another call was needed the day of the second order also not arriving on the expected delivery date. UPS one day means 4 days in my case. The first order was a ""Prime"" order."
5,Every Womans' Dream !!,"Gwen is a strong charismatic woman who is struggling against the pains of society while also raising a six year old girl from a previous relationship. She is at a point in her life where she thinks she has had her fun and now must be self-sacrificing in her daughters happiness. Her life, however, is suddenly turned upside down as Gary strolls in and sweeps her of her feet, letting her know that her life is only just about to begin if she would only open her mind to allowing her dreams to become reality."
2,Not compatible w/universal mount bracket,You can NOT use the universal mounting bracket with this board. The only one that is compatible is $[...] and is HUGE - sticks out 3 feet from from the mounting area. This information is found no where else - we had to email Huffy customer service and then pay for a lot of back and forth shipping. Do NOT follow Amazon's recommendation to purchase the 8406 bracket.
2,Not very useful to me,"Unless you are very new to coin collecting, this book has very little to offer. It does have some good, basic descriptions or discussions about US coins and their history, but if you are looking for what to pay for that next coin purchase you make, I would caution against relying only on this ""guide"".When I purchased this book, I was most interested in reading the ""Value Trends"", but was disappointed to find little in that area that was helpful. The back cover in part reads: ""It is the only book that gives you: (among several items) 'Price-performance graphs visually tracking a 12-year history of every series of US coins'."" No such graphs were in the edition I received.I would send the book back for a refund if it was worth my time. I would think most people would be better off buying the latest issue of the Grey Sheets or better yet Blue Sheets, that are available on the internet."
3,It was good...but slow,"I liked this book, and I thought it was pretty good. I liked the characters and I thought they were interesting and funny and fun to be with. But during the middle it got kind of slow and I just got bored of it...but I did finish the book and it wasn't that bad towards the end...and things sped up and it got good. But I have one complaint is that the bad scene in which they fight...it was all over too fast and at the end she made Davenport seem to angel-like which he isn't so that was weird!"
4,Superb,"Don't be put off by the somewhat depressing central subject matter of this book (alcoholism). I was, and put off reading it until I'd run out of Putney's other excellent books. I'm sorry I left it for last - it is one of the best romances ever written. You can skip the book in this series that comes before it though (""The Diabolical Baron"", which is a real ""Regency"" ie - a bit of a snooze). One does not require reading the other, first."
3,The Rake - Mary Jo Putney,I was very surprised when I read this book because I thought it would be a lot better. It was highly recommended on the forum on Amazon by the readers. I thought the author talented but I did not like the story very much. Both the hero and the heroine lived their lives according to something that happened so long ago. Then all of a sudden they forgive and forget... not a bad book but not the best.
3,Very difficult text to understand,"This text presents some major difficulties for the beginner/intermediate student of Kabbalistic works.This reviewer recommends that you have a good hebrewbackground and a to have absorbed R. Arey Kaplan's""Innerspace"" first. Along with a good grasp of theclassic Jewish texts."
5,A small taste of heaven,"Pierre Robert is similar to Brie but with a smoother, creamier taste. The best way to enjoy it is on toast points with slices of strawberry, the tang and sweetness of the berries accenting and enhancing the cheese's saltiness. You may think that the price is a little high, but I can assure you that you'll be more than satisfied with a wheel of Pierre Robert on your party table -- or just enjoy it yourself and drown in decadence."
5,I cant recommend this enough,Simply amazing.. Mia was one force of natureand the rest of the band are no slouchs eitheri cant belive I only just recently found about The GitsI'm really knocked out by thisBUY IT..you won't be sorry!!
1,"Great idea, if it would actually work as it claims....","I was so excited to find this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter who loves Pokemon. The packaging says ""it really works"" as part of it's advertisement, yet, the sad part is that the pen doesn't work! The light works just fine, so it's a cute toy item, but the very first time she tried to use it, she found that the pen doesn't write! Waste of $ & waste of a stocking stuffer..."
2,Mediocre,"If a movie is going to be marketed as sexy, then it had better be sexy or at least have fantastic acting and women. This had very little of either."
5,Wonderful! Very Funny!,"Don't let the title and the limited reviews in English misled you to thinking that this film is a T+A sex-ploitation flick.It's more in the line of Almodóvar ,maybe not like ""Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!"" , but as atmospheric. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was a total Mexican effort, not Spanish. The detective in this film is a burnout, similar to Arkady Renko in Gorky Park..but it's a true black comedy,masquerading as a hard-boiled detective film. Not bleak,just slyly comic.It has a satisfying ending, and although not a film to enjoy with your in-laws, truly amusing. My wife also thought that it was funny and enjoyable,except for her complaint that the women are near beauties, but the men look like Peter Falk's Columbo, after a very rough night.This may not be a DVD to buy,but is certainly worth the rental!"
4,Takes me right back to my high school high times!,"If you're looking for the ""long"" (and seldom played on the radio) versions of a few of these songs, you won't find them here. But if you are after the versions that you heard on the radio during this era, here they are! They couldn't have selected a better mix of artists and songs to bring out those heady, carefree, pot-smoking, girl chasing, car racing days before life got serious. If only I could go back for a week or two, knowing what I know now!..."
2,So-So Compilation,"Most of these songs are available on other CD collections. With its brutally edited versions of Sugarloaf's ""Green Eyed Lady,"" Deep Purple's ""Smoke on the Water"" and Argent's ""Hold Your Head Up,"" you should probably look elsewhere."
1,dishonest marketing as I expected a 2lb wheel not two wedges,Sadly the store that I bought this from does not believe this picture implies I would get a wheel. In fact they were the opposite of good customer service handling my complaint. Particularly when I searched wheel of parmesan on Amazon and their wheel was listed along with the large wheels that sell for over a thousand dollars. I saw and expected the 2lb wheel (so cute I thought). Somehow I was suppose to know that I got a wedge or wedges that would weigh 2lbs. This was for a Christmas present for a foodie. It is still sitting in my fridge.
3,Amazing Amazon.com,"Can't believe Amazon increase 5% on every electronics right after the good news from IRAQ. Guess they want to bank on the good news. Anyway, good converter, buy it but not here...."
4,"Very good, but somewhat expensive","IT WORKS! Now I can convert any big IDE drive to SCSI. There is still some limitations tho, such as it did not support Tagged Queues & Domain validation(unless drive set to asyn). So it's good for Raid 0 or non Raid setup and of couse not a good idea for server."
3,Beautiful but Impracticle,"This book is filled with many beautiful pictures and is the ideal ""coffee table book"". It also provides insight on the vast variety of mexican dishes. But buyer beware!!! I grew up on mexican cooking and thought this book would be a great addition to my collection, but I was wrong. This is not a practicle cook-book, and definitely not intended for the novice cook. Most recipes contain numerous ingredients (some very rare and difficult to find, even at ethnic food stores). This is a gourmet cooking book, intended for advanced cooks who are up to the challenge of hunting down rare ingredients and cooking up rare wonders."
2,beautiful -but poor recipes,"There are some errors in this book - for example, page 196, leche de mamey. 3 quarts of milk is probably 2 quarts too many, and I ended up with servings for about 24, instead of 8. Other recipes were hard to follow. All the food was good, but not quite what was intended, I think."
5,The Good the bad and the ugly women in history,I first picked up this book because of the title. Uppity Women?? I thought it was funny and when I started reading it got even better. If you hate those HUGE long winded history books but you still like to learn then this book is for you. With only one page devoted to each woman it's a fast read and an interesting one. You'll learn about Erzabet Bathory from Romania who belived that bathing in the blood of young girls was the key to staying young herself. And Elanor of Auquatine who divorced the French king to marry a younger than herself English king!
2,"Interesting Jumping off point, if you want to study.","This book is chalk full of woman who did ""amazing"" things in the middle ages. First of all, not all of it seemed that amazing, infact some of it sounded like everyday living for that time period. Second, not all woman were from the mideival period, some were from the ancient times and others in the Elizabethan Era. Third, the author is almost insulting when she dumbs things down. I was put off by her writing technique and her attitude. I would have liked more facts and more insight about these ""uppity"" women. Even the title is insulting. Uppity insinuates that these were rich girls with nothing better to do than stick their noses in the air. I'm sorry, but if a woman is struggling to support her and her family, I would not call uppity unless I wanted to get punched. I would never buy this book if I were you, I would check it out in the library, or buy it if I could return it."
3,"Superb models well-photographed, but lacking in depth","You have to envy Bill Lemon for having such beautiful models to capture on film, and this book is worth buying for its gorgeous pictures. As a guide to technique, its hints and tips are good, but there is a sameness to many of the poses and locations. A good book to have in your photo library, but not a thorough guide to shooting B&W models."
2,For beginners,"There is hardly any writing in this book. Just a photo and a few words on the opposite page. The few words that are there are really for beginners only. It's very, very basic stuff. And if you're a beginner you're going to need more info than this book provides.I'm fine with nudes, but if you're not, don't buy it.I feel bad being so harsh but it's a very poor example of a photography book."
1,Not compatible with Vista 32 either,This device does not work on Vista. Period. I finally got that from the support site after a week of constant emails and calls.
4,Awesome!!,This webcam is pretty good with this price!! pics are clear enough! web chat so far have no problem yet!
3,IT WORKS GREAT BUT....,IT WORKS GREAT BUT SOMETIMES IT FREEZES UP WHEN USING IT ON YAHOO AND MSN MESSENGERS... IF ANYONE CAN HELP ME I WOULD BE VERY THANKFUL... ANOTHER THING IS THAT THE MICROPHONE ON IT SUCKS IF USED... I CANT RECORD ANY SOUND WITH IT AND THE SOUND JUST COMES OUT TO SCRATCHY AND STATICKY... ALTHOUGH OTHER THEN THOSE ITS OKAY IT HAS GOOD PICTURE THOUGH! THESE PROBLEMS ARENT A BIG THING FOR ME SINCE 1 I'M NOT LOOKING AT THE CAM THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END IS... AND 2 I HAVE A SEPRATE MIC TO USE N E WAYS...
2,my rating is wrong,"i bought this figuring if it doent work, i wouldnt lose much money.. it doesnt come ready for vista.it has a website for vista users to make it work. it wouldnt download the drivers for any of my vista computers. it did work with windows xp. manual doent have much info to help with install and problems.used it with my window xp and it kicks butt. i would definetly recommend this to all,except vista users..sorryfor the bad reveiw,i give it 4 stars..but still 2starsfor vistausers"
1,New printhead died within 10 minutes,"I was printing a 54"" X 24"" color print on semigloss HP photopaper. After 14 inches, yellow stopped printing. Ink was full, so the printhead failed.I noted on the packaging that the printhead was sold to me near the end of it's shelf-life. It was still within the shelf-life, but buyers should be forwarned to determine the expiration date of printheads."
2,Bonus disc ALSO REGION PROTECTED,"I'm so disappointed. I knew seasons 3 and 4 were region encoded so I would need a region-free player to play then in Spain. But as I'm not going to see the whole series again for a long while, I thought I'd already have a multiregion player for that time.Then, I found the wonderfully hidden disc, which has some of the documentaries I bought this package for, and then I discovered I CAN'T SEE IT!!!!!I don't mind waiting to see the whole series again, but WHAT THE HELL???? WHY DID THEY PROTECT THAT DISC??????I'm so pissed out I don't think I ever buy in amazon again. $194 and I can't see the best material because nobody took the detail of saying the disc was region encoded.Thanks a lot, buenavista. Your region protection policy SUCKS.By the way, the complete collection in Spain has a lot of differences with the USA version, that's why I bought the american one.So, so pissed off.... :("
5,A question to the buyers,"I just love Lost.We've got all the DVDs, but want to buy the complete blu-ray collection, eventually from amazon.org (USA).Can someone tell me if the complete Lost blu-ray collection includes the french language?I know french doesn't belong to the spoken languages in the item desprition, but it was the same with some bluerays I bought from amazon.com , allthough french was inclued...Thanks a lot for your help."
3,"Love Lost, not this set","I love LOST, I am a lostie....... but I hate this set. I would have preferred to have just a standard set that would fit on my shelf..... I HATE HATE HATE the packaging... almost makes me want to return it and wait for a standard no frills box set to come out..."
2,Not a good show at all,"I am not judging the quality of the video and audio transfer. They are fine. But the show is pretty horrible so far. I will say this: I have not watched all of it yet. Just most of the first season and I really have struggles to push myself to watch further. The story has so many bad nuances in it, that it makes me think what kind of a person wrote this. Was he delusional, does he know anything about life and society. At least half of all the decisions the main characters make do not make sense (that fact that they are lost and cut off the rest of the world does not justify them). Anyway, I can see that a lot of people like this show here and will probably disagree with me. But this is my honest opinion. If I decide to watch further and somehow the show will change my mind, I will follow up. The problem is I kind of have no interest to watch it anymore."
1,lost the complete series,We were completely disappointed with our purchase due to the fact that when we went watch it we received the wrong disk's. We got 2 disk of season 6 disk 2 instead of disk 2 of season 1. And when we tried to get this issue corrected we were unable to get any help.
1,Bad Blue Rays,"The blue ray quality of this set was appalling.Season one and two were scratched, season three and four are region locked, and seasons five and six had chips in the side.I had to use four blue ray players to get one disc to work.DO NOT BUY THIS SET IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE OF AMERICA. The discs don't work and amazon don't give you any warning.Love the show, hate the place I bought it."
3,I love Lost but.... eh,The series was great. The special edition of Season 5 was much better than this. I would have expected a little more for the Complete Collection that what is here. The Dharma Kit was awesome. This one you are more or less just getting the game and some extra video content. Sad.

5,Bought this for my husband.,I got this for my husband who is obsessed with Lost! He loves all of the Bonus clips. So far only had problems with 1 disc on the end of an episode.
3,Goods and bads,"One corner of the box was already ripped before I first opened it. The part you take apart to get to the secret disc won't go back together because the cardboard is now frayed. Several discs refuse to play on my blu-ray player for some reason; all others are fine.All in all, it's still a great box of goodies for an avid Lost fan. There are too many goodies not to get it, but the workmanship is not the greatest I've seen and the fact that several of the discs don't even work makes it a bit useless."
5,Good series,This box set comes in very impressive packaging. The series was also very interesting and engaging except for the disappointing ending.
5,Lost Complete Collection,Lost complete collection is totally worth buying. It's all that Lost fan could wish for.
4,LOST- all episodes,"My husband ordered the LOST episodes from Amazon because we wanted to see the whole program again, all 7 seasons.We were very satisfied with the way it was presented. It came in a nice box marked ""LOST"" and has a game with pieces. and other memorabilia from the show,a booklet that talks about each of the characters and all the CD's needed to see the complete series with extra information included.We got a good price from Amazon and with free shipping from Amazon, it was a great gift that we will enjoy for a long time to come. I would recommend all LOST fans to consider it for purchase."
5,Incredibly Good,"Nothing bad to say about it. Looks amazing and is incredible quality. Just beware if buying from Australia that seasons 1,2,5,6 and the bonus disk will play on normal blu ray players but seasons 3,4 will require a region free blu ray in order to be watched.Other then that, an absolutely amazing package with lots of hidden bonus features.5 Star."
3,All Six Season Collection after I already Bought the first Five,I understand that they want to give a good deal to those who were waiting till the end to buy the show but I have been religiously watching this show from season 1 and have bought all five seasons. Including the awesome season five DHARMA edition. But for them to only have a collection with extra tidbits only if you buy all six seasons is ridiculous. I want to buy it because Lost was such a huge part of my life but I can't see paying almost 200 dollars after already giving them about 300 (fifty for the first four and 80 for the fifth) dollars in DVD sales prior to this. I think they need to come up with something for those who already bought the first five and still want something extra.
2,Kind of boring,"I don't have a television and do not live in the United States, but someone gave me a set of disks, which I watched on my computer. Well, that's not true. I watched the first five episodes of the first season, then gave up on it. This was largely because (a) each character was a modern drama archetype, (b) no character behaved believably, (c) the story was needlessly strung out, strung out only for the sake of making the serial draw people to watch the next episode. Really not much interesting here, just typical American tv junk. Some of the scenery is pretty, though."
1,What you see is not what you get,"From the description and the photos, it looked like I would get all kinds of cool things with this. I got the disks for the show, but they were in a box that didn't even have packaging to keep them from rocking around. I got this for my neice who is a LOST fanatic. Where's the game? Where's the stuff from the photo? Did I completely misundestand what I was ordering? I feel like I was ripped off."
2,You want answers?,"Forget it! The only way this show worked was by stringing it out over such a long period of time that you forget almost 75% of the things you hear over the seasons.This show had so much magic, character development, mystery, and epic battles that it was such a shame to end it the way it did.If you watch this show from beginning to end you will feel very let down by the ending. Not to say it isn't a good ending, but it's an ending of a SEASON not of a SERIES. This show left absolutely way too much unanswered.In the middle of Season 6 I ordered this set. After the show ended, I canceled my order. Why rewatch the entire show only to know it ends without answering all the things you wanted to know about?"
5,Clarification: ALL seasons included.,"Contrary to some confused reviewers, all six seasons will be included in this collection. Since the newest season is not yet complete, they can not list a synopsis in the product description. That being said, Lost is the most original and creative television series of all time, and I'm sure this collection will be bursting with easter eggs and plenty of behind the scenes info for die hard fans.Also, the extra features are A-MAZING! There are so many easter eggs and fun mysteries to discover in the package itself! Really a fabulous Lost set, perfect for any fan of the show. I enjoyed this collection so much, don't miss out on a great piece of television history."
3,Mixed quality in seasons,"Seasons 1,2 5 and 6 have HD audio and are region free. 2 and 3 are region A, have NO HD sound, have a lot of differences in the menus and the picture is darker than the others. That was very disappointing for the what seemed to be the ultimate lost collection."
4,Excellent except for Region code,"This is a great box set, in fact the best box set that I've seen. It's solid, packed with features and somewhere in there is one of the greatest television shows of all time. The island really shines on Blu-Ray, the perfect format for all that green. The one thing I'm disappointed about, is they're all region-free except for season 4 (and possibly season 3, I haven't checked those disks yet). So be warned, if you don't have a player that plays all regions, you'll miss out on much of season 4's greatness. Pretty annoyed since this wasn't written about at all on the product description."
4,"Great, except for one thing....","If you are a Lost fan then you MUST buy this set. It is loaded with features and hidden secrets. The visual quality of the Blu-Ray is fantastic. I had to dock it one star though because of the fact that not only is there no commentary for ""The End"" (which Damon and Carlton promise in another commentary track), but the commentaries themselves are not mentioned as special features on any of the disks for Season 6. I had to go online and find out which episodes had commentaries and manually select the audio track. Also, the booklet that lists the episodes doesn't mention what special features are on which disk. Would have been handy. Other than that there is a phenomenal amount of value to this set for the best show in TV history!"
5,UNBELIEVABLE,"I have no words. I haven't watched any episode from this amazing set yet, but I know it is not gonna let me down.This set is amazing and every person of the world should buy it. Thanks, Amazon, you never let me down.THANKS LOST, FOR THESE SIX YEARS."
1,LOST got truly lost at the end,"Save your shekels. LOST is a terribly creative, fun, engaging show. But it's also one that goes nowhere interesting ultimately. Five seasons of build-up, and they say at the end, ""IT'S MAGIC!""Do not buy this crap. Damon Lindelof is a hack. Carlton Cuse is worse than that. J.J. Abrams must wish his name was not on this product."
3,LOST,I ORDERED IT AND IT WAS HERE IN A FEW DAYS HOWEVER WHEN MY DAUGHTER WENT TO PLAY A SHOW IT WOULD NOT WORK BECAUSE ITS BLURAY. I ORDERED DVD BUT THEY SENT BLURAY. SENDING BACK AND GETTING A REFUND WHICH WAS VERY EASY AND NO HASSEL BUT I WILL HAVE TO HUNT DOWN ANOTHER ONE FOR HER. SHE IS SAD TO HAVE TO WAIT! IT HAPPENS.
1,dvd quality is poor,I am sorry it took me so long to find the time to watch the dvds.. Bad Dvds throughout this set.
5,Best TV series ever,"I did not order this from amazon, I received it as a gift, but Lost in my opinion is the best TV series ever. Having it in high definition blu ray makes it even more amazing! There are many special features and a hidden bonus disc. I think there are quite a few hidden ""easter eggs"" included on the discs but I havent taken the time to find them all yet. The box itself is full many exciting things, even before you get to the actual discs. I recommend this to anyone."
5,"Beautifull set, honoring the series",Amazing set! Wel packaged and full of neet items. The price is a bargain even without the discount. A musthave collector's item for any and all Lost fans/fanatics. Quality is outstanding as to be expected with blu-ray.
4,Lost,"First 4 seasons are absolutly fantastic. The 5th season is still alright but not as good. The last season is not very good at all. Not sure what happened to the writers on the last season but what a complete waste on some of the directions they took and how they tried to pull it off. Just doesn't work. They needed to focus more on the mythology and giving answers and less time on squirrel Claire. How they explained the whispers felt like a 6 year let down. Also, the last season needed more of Desmond! The series is worth it for the first 4 seasons alone though."
3,Lost Question,This is not a review this is a question. I would like to know one thing. I don't want to know about the characters or the island or if the 6th season was the worst of all the seasons. I just want to know if it was a good show. I haven't seen the show before and i was thinking of buying this boxset so if someone could answer me if it was a good show thats it nothing else. Thank You- 3 Stars because I don't know if I hate it or if I love it.
1,Cool packaging terrible product,This is the worst garbage I've ever watched. I lost all respect for this show with the terrible ending they wrote.
1,MOST disappointing series finale EVER! Waste of 6 years...,"I could have thought at least 5 different better endings to this show.It was entertaining... But at the end, the show has proved to be no more than a cheap SOAP OPERA!So spending about $200 for a Blu-ray collection? Sure, if you have time and money to waste... Why not?"
5,One of the best DVD collections ever,"..Awesome product, either you're a fan or not.The packaging is very well done: the box, the extra objects,...I didn't expect this to be so good and complete.The extra DVD is just something a long-time fan should have, and the price is very good too!"
5,relax nerds,"Some of you one and two star reviewers need a life, badly. The show was good for what it was, and season 6 definitely explained everything about the earlier smaller plots and side stories. And those crying about the cereal box toys this box set comes with, I would like to ask you, ""WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS GOING TO COME IN IT!"" This box set is the type of thing a fan buys, watches one more time or so, than it sits on a self or in a closet; which is fine by me and I'm pretty sure plenty other fans feel the same way."
5,great show,"Not only was this a great show, but the box this came in was really cool, and fun to keep."
5,Greatest Show Ever.,This collection was worth every penny. I love LOST and having the entire series on blu-ray is one of the best things I could ever own. Not to mention the sheer amount of extras included with it and all of the insider footage. Great purchase for anyone who is into LOST.
2,Old dictionary,"The is old issue, newest issue is No 4 with circa 80,000 terms and published in 2000 or 2001"
3,Not Worth the Money,I was disapointed with the desk. When I was putting the desk together and screwing in the screws; part of the desk came apart. I had to get some super glue to fix the desk. I was mad that I had spent good money on this desk and the screw supports came out of the wood.
5,tanita scale review,"purchased a tanita scale 5 years ago and used it regularly. I saw this latest ironman version and decided to upgrade. Interestingly the cost for the latest upgraded model cost the same as the intro model 5 years ago. So, you get more for your money. The durability of the new scale far exceeds the old one. There are also many more features...body water %, muscle mass, basal metabolic rate, and metabolic age to name a few. I am very happy I made the purchase. Especially since the scale came up with a 15 for metabolic age and I'm 40! It's a quality product!!"
1,Don't Buy This,"I thought this would be a good item to have when it appeared in my Gold Box. It arrived with dead batteries and two booklets of complex directions. This scale is not simple to use, it tips from side to side when stepping on and to see the display, one must lean over to see the numbers as they flash past---a test of balance and agility not mentioned in the promotional material. The design is not user friendly and the price is out of line with its functionality. It's only good feature is the low profile and sleek appearance of the glass surface. Not worth it!"
3,muffler,"The muffler seems to be working just fine. It lets the motor breath well, but i thought it might have a little more noise from it. It is pretty quiet."
4,EDITED REVIEW,"When I originally reviewed this album, apparently a glitch occured and instead of my 4 star rating being posted, 2 stars were posted instead. Things like this happen; our world is less than perfect. this album is a very strong one, but for my personal tastes, Illusions on a Double Dimple and Spartacus are phenominal. Old Loves is more of a commercial offering with less musical experimentalism. Still, the material is solid and inspired, just a different avenue of exploration that I did not find as appealing as the others. This album started the downward slope that followed with Pompeii, a la Carte, and Russian Roulette, the latter two titles widely regarded as total commercial rubbish. Unfortunately Double Dimple and Spartacus are out of print, I have made so many copies for people it is unreal. Fortunately, Old Loves, a more accessable offering, is availabe and recommended. My apologies for not catching this error earlier."
2,NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS FIRST TWO RELEASES,"The ILLUSIONS album was a masterpiece. SPARTACUS was very very good as well. This , the third, has some moments equal to the earlier releases, but overall it falls short in music complexities and depth. Some of the cuts are bad. I bought this one a few years back and have rarely played it. But OLD LOVES is much better than its followup, POMPEII , which was almost a total disgrace. Get OLD LOVES for the 3 or 4 really good tracks. Play POMPEII by NEW TRIUMVARAT to get rid of unwanted dinner guests."
5,Great performance of absolutely beautiful pieces,"This CD contains two very significant concertos of Mozart's. The first, K271 in E-flat, may well be considered his first adult concerto. In addition, it is the first concerto to introduce the piano before the orchestral ritornello, a concept to be utilzed by Beethoven in his 4th and 5th piano concertos as well as in Brahms' 2nd piano concerto. It also contains a wonderful and serious minor-key slow movement, reminding me of earlier opera seria. The G-major piano concerto is simply one of Mozart's most beautiful and perfect works, gay and happy from start to finish. It is a concerto whose every movement may be considered a masterpiece, significant in that many of Mozart's concertos have both strong and weak movements. Barenboim is a distinguished pianist and conductor. This CD is a must-have."
1,Note the $10 shipping cost,"$10 for shipping, over 60% of the price of this item itself, what a complete rip off. Way to hide the price."
3,Average,They do not seem to be as warm as they should be for a sock so thick. They also do not stay up very well. They do stay pretty dry and are very comfortable.
4,warm and toasty,"These socks are warm and toasty, with the right pair of boots. They warm your feet up fast. I would recommend these socks to anyone who have really cold feet like me."
3,Not as muscular as the cover suggests,"Many Grand Funk purists would argue that the band peaked as early as their first live album, but commercially they just went from strength to strength. Released not long after a couple of chart-topping hits, ""All the Girls in the World Beware!"" was the beginning of the end for Grand Funk Railroad. Although tracks like ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" had their appeal, it's hard to believe that the same band that recorded the classic ""red"" album just a few years previously was now responsible for such bland fare as ""Bad Time"". The greatest irony is that just when the market for hard rock was growing like a monster, one of the prime acts of the genre was fading away to a meek shadow of its former self"
4,A handy dosha guide you can carry anywhere,"Being a proponent of the Ayurvedic system, I was thrilled to find this dosha guide that fits into your pocket or handbag. It's not always easy to remember what's best for your dosha, or as Cox calls it ""mind-body type"". The dosha system is a logical and extremely healthy way to gauge the optimal healthy regime, especially customized for your body. But what happens when you can't remember if you're supposed to eat lentils or avoid them when you're ordering dinner at a restaurant? This terrific dosha guide has a color-coded chart for Vatas, Pittas and Kaphas for not only food but exercise, the seasons and living conditions. What a great idea! And with the very affordable price tag, they also make an excellent present. I'm going to stuff a lot of stockings with this baby for Christmas."
3,not in store.,Seller's contact was great. They let me know that they regretfully had to tell me that the book was not in the store like their inventory said. great seller so far.
3,Good following book,This is a good follow up to When Worlds Collide. It's too bad it cannot be rewritten to take in 75 years of advances in sciences. If you liked the first you will like the second.
4,A Must Read if You Read the First!,"This is a must read if you have read When Worlds Collide. Not much in the way of science fiction. More along the lines of the fear of Communism that gripped the US post-WW II. In the book other countries had the same idea as the US about the impending disaster and were also able to launch rockets to the new world before the Earth is destroyed. The people from those rockets are not too ""benevolent"" and try to harness what they find left over from the earlier civilizations of the new planet to become masters of the planet.We find that even though the prior races have long since perished, most of the machinery left behind still works. If you bear in mind the period that the book was written you should find it a very entertaining read."
5,"Entertaining and Yes, Mysterious is Right.","I came across the first of these two books about ten years ago, after seeing the film, and I enjoyed it very much. I didn't realize there was a sequel, however, until recently, and I was lucky enough to find a copy. It was worth the effort. The character development is good, the question of what happened to the new planet's previous inhabitants underlies everything, and the element of conflict is pretty good too, especially for the times. The authors raise several interesting questions. What would you do about the repopulation problem and the unequal man/woman ratio? How would you rebuild a civil government? And so on. ""After Worlds Collide"" is definitely a worthwhile and entertaining read."
3,Good not great,"The main tunes that attracted me to this compilation were Buffalo Stance, I'll Be Good To You, and Who's Zoomin' Who. I had hoped that the other songs on the album would be just as spirited. This is a mix of ballads and dance music. As a compilation, I think the changes from fast to slow songs and back again don't really ""work"". All of the same songs in a different order might give the album a whole different feel and flow. Still, this cd adds some more great music to my collection of 80s compilation cds--I'm glad I bought it."
2,Not as good as puppy party,"My wife picked up puppy party and it ended up being a go-to hit for my son. I picked up kitten party but it was not a hit. In fact, my son was bored with it and has never watched more than a couple minutes. Not sure why, it has the same narrator and a similar style but somehow it is just not as good as puppy party."
3,Not as good as puppy party,"Puppy party gives information about each breed of dogs - it goes through many breeds one at a time.I though this would be similar. It talks a bit about the kittens, but mostly it is just kittens playing. It is cute, but not informative. Because we had Puppy Party first, I was disappointed in this."
3,Not as fun as YouTube or Animal Planet!,"I wouldn't recommend this for anyone over about age 5. Parents are likely to go nuts watching it because the script for this poor narrator could not possibly be dumber. Mute it and it's still a lot of the same clips over and over. YouTube has cuter kitten videos, so if you have Amazon.com access, use that computer to entertain your kids! :-)Still, though, this gets three stars because... Kittens, you know? Pretty much the best creatures ever. :-) It's cute if you have money to blow, but Animal Planet and YouTube are way better."
2,"Disappointing, but mildly cute.","We already had Puppy Party for our 7 year-old, and she loved it. It made a good effort at explaining traits of the breeds of puppies. Kitten party momentarily introduces about 10 breeds, and then tell you nothing useful about any of them. There is almost no educational value. My daughter likes it, but it's just 70 minutes of watching mildly cute kittens play."
3,Tries to be all things to all people.,"My son is crazy about kittens, so I thought this would be perfect for him. While he is (for the most part) completely happy with it, I was a bit disappointed.First of all the narration is constant, and unnecessary. A moment of quiet or background music would be nice.Additionally, as other reviews have stated, there is a high level of repeated footage. We have all seen kittens playing, there is no way you could not have gotten 75 minutes of adorable footage without a repeat.I would have to say the most annoying part of all though is the lapses into ""other kitties in the animal kingdom"", ""completely unrelated animals"", and ""terrible computer animation"". This is called ""Kitten Party"". I have access to plenty of other animal kingdom dvds for my child. I have plenty of access to poorly executed computer animation. Please do not use it as filler on this dvd.The price is cheap, but in this case, you get less than what you paid for. Heads up!"
5,Great Item Fast Delivery,Item exactly as described and it arrived unbelieveably fast. It was well packaged-up
4,Take Me Back!,"This is a great CD, brings back alot of good memories from the Monastery in Seattle, dancin' to ""Searchin'"" at 5 or 6am! My only gripe is that they should have put the original, long version of ""Searchin'"" on this CD."
4,Comfort,Just as comfortable as predicted - they can slip off your feet however if you wear them with socks !!!
4,Silktime is Hot....,"I bought the CD when it hit the stores on 9/23/2003. At first the only song that I listened to was Silktime, and then I let the CD play through. There are quite a few songs on the CD that I like, especially the first four. There is also a remake of Blue Magic's ""Sideshow"", which by the way sounds identical to the original. Great Job Guys. Welcome back!!!Mystique"
3,not bad at all,This album doesnt deserve no one star rating!! Its not their best album but its certainly not bad at all. The absense of lil g does weaken the album but in my opinion it s worth picking up!
2,Straight Booty!!! Where is Lil' G?,"I want my money back!!!! For you definite Silk fans from back in the day, this cd, much like the last one, will surely disappoint! I was curious as to why there was no photo of the group on the cover. Well, there is no photo because it appears that the main voice, Lil' G (think his name was Gary Jenkins)appears to no longer be with them.....and boy are they missing homie's vocal chords!!!! The only song remotely decent is the Blue Magic remake of ""Side Show"", produced by Keith Sweat, and even that could have been stronger. I am too [upset] to write anything else, so I hope this helps. Save your money on this one and cop it out of the bargain bins in a few months.Lil' G....come home please!!!!Maddmusic signing out.....Holla."
1,Tap them on the shoulders. It's over.,"Silk - Silktime (Liquid 8, 2003)Perhaps Lil' G was right in leaving. I think I was the only person who bought their last album, Love Session, and for that, the group was dropped from Elektra Records. Now the remaining four (who ARE good singers, by the way) are on an indie label. But you have to look at the elements here. First, the album cover looks strikingly similar to their 1994 self-titled album cover, almost as if it was photocopied. Also, the song titles are generic (""Silktime"", ""Silklove""). And don't think I haven't listened to this album: all of the songs, though sung well, have subpar lyrics that are at times even profane. Finally, Lil' G was the best singer in the group and was the glue that held it together. It's time for the group to gracefully bow out and let the 112's and Jagged Edges have their turn. This album isn't even Shareaza-worthy. You're better off listening to Musiqtime or Beyoncetime. -EJR"
1,SILK NOW WITHOUT SOUL,When I heard that silk had a new cd out I ran out and got it what a BUST! The songs on silktime have no flow no heart no soul Gary lil'g jenkins was a big part of what made silk great. So save your self time and money. Get Gary lil'g Jenkins solo cd when it comes out!!!!
2,pretty average,Silk was a Group that could never get between Jodeci&Boyz11Men but somehow they are the link to 112&Jagged Edge of today.Silk has good vocals&Talent there.they started out as a Portege of Keith Sweat&Like Keith they found a way to stay in the game but unlike Keith they were more on the single tip than a whole album or even a whole set.Vocally&some of the music is on point but they never grew as Artists&just went through the motions as a Group.but to there credit they are still going on.
4,Silk still rock w/o Lil G,"I loved this CD. I own every album Silk has made. I don't even have to hear the album just as long as it says Silk I'm all over. I can't believe Lil G isn't in the group. I wonder why he left? It really doesn't matter just as Jon-Jon doesn't leave. Jon Jon has always been a lead singer even before Silk had their own album even when they sang back up for Keith Sweat. Lil G and Jon Jon shared lead vocals and I think it was Jon Jon voice that sat Silk apart from the other groups. However, Lil G will be missed but his voice is replacable."
2,Tu Amor Single,"I give this CD-Single only 2 stars because it only has 2 tracks and it has NO remixes, it should of at least had the Chico Latino Remix of ""Tu Amor"" or the DJ Brito Reggaetton Remix of ""Wanna Play"" or any other remix of any othe RBD songHeres the tracksTu Amor1.Album Version2.Radio Edit"
3,"I love 'em, but not a favorite","Jerry Hadley's death was a loss to Opera, and I always loved his work. Hampson is superb. But I somehow just couldn't get ""into"" this collection. Opera should be ""seen."" As lovely as the Pearl Fishers selection is, I prefer my recording of Jussi Bjorling and Robert Merrill. This is not to denigrate this collection. It's fine. I just probably wasn't in the mood for it."
3,Not good as a cooler,"I like this product and the idea of the product. However, when my son is playing with the mat, I am unable to keep other products cool. Also, things move around like larger items so I have spilled food and juice during traveling. My son likes to play with the toys, but it does not fair well as a cooler. I have since just put the play mat portion with the toys in his diaper bag."
5,Call Me When His Company Expands to Alabama!,"This book outlines the way Ricardo runs his company, trusting his workers as responsible adults. My own style of working on priorities that I think are important to my company as well as interesting/important to me (i.e. win-win) fits perfectly with his company culture. This style does take ""some"" convincing to believe it works, but his numerous examples back up the success of the style. Maybe his company COULD increase the bottom line by 10% by changing to a typical authoritarian company model, but I agree with him that this style trades that extra 10% for the new business ventures dreamed up by free-thinking employess... not to mention the 1000% extra level of job satisfaction that his folks must enjoy compared to the rest of us that, until reading this book, only thought we were perfectly happy with."
5,YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!,"In fact Don't Bore Us Get To The Chorus is one of the best done Greatest Hits I ever bought, has a little thought of each hit by Roxette and has every hit that was release, so this album is very complete and satisfying cos it includes tha master hits that made Roxette one of the most played POP bands of the late 80's before it faded out of the STARDOM status, without losing their creativity demostraded on the next two albums, the best tracks are DRESSED FOR SUCCESS, SPENDING MY TIME(I totally agree that this should have been their greatest hit, but then promotion got the song stuck in oblivion), FADING LIKE A FLOWER, and IT MUST HAVE BEEN LOVE, a great album to enjoy."
5,An amazing anthology,this is the most amazing collection of Roxette songs I have heard. a definite must for both the fan and occasional connessiuer.
5,A FANTASTIC COLLECTION OF SONGS,"This roxette collection is simply an EXPLOSIVE MICTURE OF MELODY,RHYTHME AND EMOTION."
5,I love the CD,It has all of their great hits and some good not so frequently heard things. I am very happy with my purchase. Good for the Roxette lover.
4,Everything you'll ever need from Roxette,"Although the second half of Roxette's Don't Bore Us retrospective lags because of the hokiness of tracks 8-18, the first half more than compensates for it. Roxette's 80's material is obviously the highlight of this album, and includes the fantastic ""Fading Like a Flower,"" ""You Don't Understand,"" ""The Look,"" ""Must Have Been Love,"" and my personal favorite ""Listen to Your Heart. Definitely pick this import up if you can find it. It provides a much more complete retrospective than the American version of Roxette's Greatest Hits. And since most people here love Pop ballads like I do, I also recommend anything by Belinda Carlisle spanning from her 1986 debut up until her 1991 Live Your Life Be Free album."
1,the chair cover,"I thought this would be nice in a room on my chair, but it was miss fitting an sheet looking and returning it was horrible. they just would not let me return it easy from Target stores and then Amazon came to the rescue. The Target store even sent me another one? This was not amazon as I have known it. It worked out with amazon getting involved, but I would not make a purchase linked to Target through amazon again."
3,Interesting look at the USSR but title is misleading,"This DVD has four episodes: I) Red Victories of the KGB, which documents the successes Soviet spies enjoyed in the West (II) Soviet Sports Wars, about the secret efforts the USSR pursued in order to make itself competitive at international sports (III) Secret Soviet Moon Mission, discussing Korolev and the hidden world of the Soviet space program and (IV) Soviet Propaganda Machine, a discussion of how the Soviet Union controlled information within its own borders and also tried to effect the international media. The subtitle of this work is ""Secrets of the Russian Archives Revealed"" but very little of what appears in this set is newly-uncovered information or even new footage backing up much of what is discussed. There are some great and touching first-person accounts by former Soviet citizens, however, and it does much to document the communist state."
5,Greatness from Her Humble Beginnings,"Olivia was the first real sensation from the land down under to make it big in the United States. While her early stuff (as featured here beautiful remastered on this two-disc set) didn't garner the kind of attention her pop turn would several years later, these songs are the tunes of legend: simply performed, simply vocalized with an artistry unmatch in her career, Olivia puts a stamp on country with equal parts homespun innocence and blossoming sex appeal. It's incredible to hear how clear her voice was back in her early days, and it's arguably remarkable that she still commands a stage with her voice so many years later.While the production qualities in this remastering are top notch, this collection is purely intended for Olivia's die hard fans. Her versions of classics written by John Denver, Bob Dylan, and Gordon Lightfoot are exceptional interpretations, but their impact may be lost on the casual listener."
5,Followed here career from my teenage years,Olivia has been a fan of my for at least 20 years. She is very talented and I love to hear her accent when she sings. I have all of her albums tapes and cd's. She is very popular and I like the fact that she cares enough about the planet to speak out for it.
3,Learn from the mistakes of others,"This book is about as good as a presentation can get, when the subject is politico-business in a small rural state. At times dry, owing to the details Burford gives, this book is generally emotional as the author recounts his dealings.The tale of the rise, conflicts, and fall of an Attorney-turned-big-businessman as he makes millions. Only to lose it through the greed and corruption of those in power in political and banking circles.Read this book, if for no other reason than to learn what can happen when business and politics are badly mixed!"
5,Sir Andrew does it again,"Sir Andrew Davis is a great conductor who has a thorough grasp of the music he conducts. Even though Davis is very competent with all his music, his knowledge and feeling for British composers is absolutely amazing. Of course, Vaughan Williams is part of this wonderful group and after listening to this CD one cannot help but rate it with 5 stars"
5,A Seven Star Item,There is no excuse for any christian to not read the King James Bible. This book is a textbook for a full course on how to understand the Bible by using the Bible itself. Riplinger shows the keys to defining words in the Bible by the Bible's own built-in system. She also shows how this system is absent in modern versions making them harder to understand that the King James Version itself.
5,Awesome reference bible book,"The Greekifiers use corrupt lexicons that date back to Kittle a Nazi. Type in your search bar Greek Lexicons and the Nazi connections;Its a very interesting and revealing study as the Greek/Hebrew Gurus grow in numbers. Then you have a corrupt Hebrew text that says Elhannon killed Goliath,and gossip is choice morsels instead of a bad thing,a young maiden will conceive not virgin and tons of corruption. Yes obviously the KJV isn't based on these corrupt text. In fact the KJV is the only bible in the Psalms God says he will not just inspire but preserve. In fact if you use the Greek lexicon dictionaries you can make any bible you want by choosing one of the five words per word like any dictionary. These people are worse than the Anti Christ he will change times and seasons, these Greekifiers want to change the bible."
1,Illogical and slanted,"This entire book is one big logical fallacy. It sets up the KJV as the rule and compares all the other translations to it. Of course the other translations are going to be different! And if the KJV is the rule, any change in another translation is automatically seen as inferior. Also, if you even know a little bit about Greek and English grammar, you would know that it is impossible to have a word for word translation let alone letter for letter. I love the King James Translation, but we must remember that is a translation. We cannot reject the manuscripts. The only thing AWE inspiring about this book is that its 1200 pages of fallacy."
4,Good work by G.R.,"This release grows on you, the more times you listen to it.It's not as hard as Symptoms of a Leveling Spirit, but it's brilliant work. Once again, any true fan should buy this CD.I would say it's one of their better albums."
2,"Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism with an Essay on Baal Worship, on the Assyrian Sacred Grove and other Allied Symbol",This was an old book and the quality was very poor. It was written in a way that was hard for me to understand.
4,They're mad!,"The music featured in this CD is not of the best Vivaldi, and not the best of his concerti da camera. But this version of 'La Follia', a set of 20 variations on the theme, published in Vivaldi's opus 1, is completely nuts! Heavy Metal meets Vivaldi... again."
4,A Story....,"Is this book Mount St. Charles 101? No it is not, and I thoroughly enjoyed the book for that reason. Mr. Gillooly is writer first and foremost ( which is more than some can say i.e. ""were` and ""where"" ), who then happens to have an interest in high school sports. The story covers one particular year with a team that involves certain individuals that fit into a larger framework of what it is to be a Mount hockey player. One could make the comparison that it is the ""Friday Night Lights"" of hockey."
5,"No, thank Duran Duran","I would just like to write a rebuttal to the previous review. I would just like to say that, like the previous writer, I am a huge Duran Duran fan, and this only strengthened my convictions about this cover album. Thank You happens to be one of my favorite cds. I've actually come to like the Duran Duran verions of all of these songs better than the originals."
2,Thanks but NO Thanks to Thank You,"I am a longtime DD fan and own everything they done, plus Arcadia and Powerstation albums. I really do love DD, but Thank You has about 2 songs that are any good. Unless you have to own everything DD has done, then save your money. If you want a good laugh just listen to DD do 911 is a Joke. I almost thought this was joke album, kind of like William Shatner Albums."
3,"I don't quite ""get"" Stross yet","This is an enjoyable book, lot sof ideas and a lot going on, but I just don't quite ""get"" what Stross is going for. This sequel is less ""out there"" than the fist book in the series, but I still cannot quite connect with it. It is an intersting read, to be sure, and not boring by any means, but it lacks a real dramtic hook and I cannot connect with the characters."
1,Don't Bother...,"Charles Stross. One of the main authors in the hard sci-fi genre. Felt it I should check him out. Unfortunately, unlike Alastair Reynolds or Iain Banks, Stross seems to utterly lack the ability to make you care about the people in his books. Read about a third of the way through and just realized ""I don't care how this ends..."" and put it down."
1,Don't bother...,"The avalanche of four letter words adds nothing to a very disjointed story line. The action is kind of like when my friend first learned to drive stick shift, jerks from one place to another. I was all set for an inter-galactic adventure and was very disappointed. Maybe his other books are better but I am not interested in finding out."
2,Not a well written story,This book just wasn't very good but I finished it anyway. I've read the entire series hoping they would get better. They did not. The books actually were worse as the story progressed. Bummer.
5,Great book in the classic sci-fi tradition,"If you like hardcore sci-fi, this is a must read. The writing is a good mix of cyber-punk styles with more classic sci-fi themes. If you liked Neuromancer or Hyperion, pick up this book."
2,This short story writer needs a continuity editor,"Iron Sunrise, while an improvement over the nearly incomprehensible Singularity Sky, still lacks the qualities necessary to make it worth adding to your personal library.The author needs someone to follow after him, asking him, ""how could this character know Frank's history? She wasn't even on board when he told Sven and the bartender?""Or, ""Which is it? Does Hoechst have pale or black hair?"" (p. 195)I suspect that much of my confusion from Singularity Sky came from the author's inability to remember what he'd written before, rather than the patois of the Critics or the broken quotes from the Communist Manifesto.If you must read it, check it out at your public library.After forcing myself to read through two, I doubt I'll read any others."
2,"Tedious and Plodding, A Good Idea Slowed Down to Drivel","The only reason for reading ""Iron Sunrise"" is the rightfully acclaimed ""Singularity"". Unfortunately, as for the book itself, it's just STL (slower than lame) as opposed to FTL (favorite title listing). They story could have been good but Stross spends sooo much time playing with his technical writing that the story gets subsumed along the way.Rachel and Martin are little more than tangential characters, and the girl who the story relies on (Victoria Strowger aka Wednesday Shadowmist) is just not that interesting. The bad guys/gals called the 'ReMastered' (notice the second capital, real cool, huh?) do everything but hiss like snakes when they talk. They are soooo bad that they kill off each other for not being bad enough (no not Boris Badinov).The plot is so thin as to be translucent and it never captured your imagination or emotions. Sophomore jinx for Rachel Mansour."
1,Not for the squeamish,"First, let me say I had never read Stross before. The professional reviews of this book led me to expect a fairly standard space opera, and the Hugo nomination made me hope for something above the ordinary. I was sorely disappointed on both counts.The book started slowly with entirely too much description and technical background. In excess of the first quarter of the book is devoted to setting the scene and getting the central plot moving. But those are minor flaws compared to the other ones.Stross managed to thoroughly alienate me with the unpleasant characters, violence, and sick sex. I wanted to wash out my mouth and take a shower after one particularly graphic description.The cover of the paperback edition says the book is a ""Hollywood thriller with a cyberpunk heart."" I would reverse the emphasis and say it embodies all the worst of cyberpunk with no apparent redeeming social value. Don't waste your reading time on this one!"
3,Along the same lines as Singularity Sky... decent sequel.,"Pretty much a followup to the world Stross has created and even many of the same characters. This is slightly above-average sci-fi. I read a lot of sci-fi though, and slightly above-average is good for me, as I read (or don't finish reading) a lot of bad sci-fi. At least this gets finished. It is readable."
4,Interstellar Realpolitik With A Little James Bond,"Nice piece of interstellar intrigue, secret agents, planetary conquest, and a being with ""weakly godlike"" powers. The plot twists aren't always surprising, but its a good effort."
3,Joint Review of Singularity Sky and Iron Sunrise; 3.5 Stars,"Singularity Sky and Iron Sunrise were Stross' two first novels and generally solid space opera type work. Stross basic future history, the world of the Eschaton, is a generally entertaining construct. He uses several of the technological conceits like features of time travel, evolution of artificial intelligence, etc., in a fairly creative way. Like a lot of his work, there is a satiric edge to these books, though they are less overtly joky than some of his work. Character development and quality of prose are workman-like. In what is a recurrent feature of his work, there is romance between a geeky but technically competent man and attractive and highly competent women. Plotting is somewhat elaborate but generally presented adequately. Again like other of his books, the plotting and general tenor of these books draws on popular espionage thrillers."
1,Life changing!,"For anyone looking to enter into a COMMITTED & PURPOSEFUL relationship (something that's a rarity nowadays), Eddie Long's book is a definite starting place. It's direct, humerous and down-to-earth approach will make you laugh, cry and above seriously think about how to conduct any current or future relationships...His book is one for ALL genders... but a definite one to read!"
3,Needs a scroller,"This is a pretty comfy mouse. There's a lot less wrist strain than a typical mouse, which is especially useful in repetitive situations. I haven't had any major issues, except for when the rollers get dirty. Unlike a typical optical mouse, you still have to worry about cleaning this one with frequency depending on usage. I haven't used the trackballs where it's located near the thumb, so I can't attest to its advantages/disadvantages. However, finger positioning is importantThe one thing I really do miss from a conventional mouse is the scroll button. It's become nearly indispensable for me when scrolling web pages or even long documents in word processing programs. It can be awkward scrolling with a trackball mouse--at least for me.If you don't require a scrolling button, this is worth checking out."
3,Stupid trackball falls out too easily,"I don't get it. My supposedly obsolete Logitech Marble Mouse has two additional programmable buttons and the trackball itself doesn't fall out. But this Kensington trackball has no function buttons and, if you knock over the trackball, the ball *will* fall out and onto the floor. That's fine if you're a cat -- but annoying if you're a human with little desk space, a trackball next to the edge of your desk, a hardwood floor, and a cat who likes to bat balls under furniture."
2,Skipping due to a batch of bad balls,"I bought two of these and now have three. All of them are skipping due to a batch of bad balls. This optical mouse is an excellent feel with rubberized finish and smooth tracking except when the dark parts of the ball roll over the optical sensor.I own many Kensington products and their warranty is always a no-questions-asked affair direct from Kensington/ACCO Brands. I just wanted to replace the balls but they sent an entirely new unit, unfortunately from the same batch of bad balls.I cannot recommend this trackball mouse. Unfortunately it's out of production and all you will get now are ones with bad balls."
2,No Middle Button and No Scroll Function...otherwsie it's great...but it's dealbreaker for me.,"I like the look, feel, and design.But the lack of middle button or scroll button really killed it for me...had to ship it back after trying hard to love it!"
3,The ball comes out easily,"My kids (5 and 4) use this instead of a regular mouse. It seems durable and responsive enough, and they don't get frustrated trying to use it. The one problem is that the ball comes out pretty easily and I'm afraid it's going to get lost."
4,a title,"Good mouse at a good price. My only complaint would be that when I take it with my laptop case the ball does not stay in place. So far so good, but I have a feeling I am going to either lose it or damage it by dropping it one of these rushed days.Best if left on the desktop."
4,great for a lefty,"So far this has been a pretty good mouse. Wanting a trackball and being left-handed, I didn't have a lot of choices. I've had Kensington trackballs before and have liked them but the rollers disintegrated making them unusable, so this time I wanted an optical sensor instead of the rollers for reliabilty and it seems to be fine. This one works well under normal use but quick cross-screen movements can mess it up. That's a rare occurrance and not much of a problem, just startling to have the pointer not be where you're expecting it."
1,Awful,I was going to say the frequent stalling of the pointer was annoying but is goes way beyound that. It is infuriating. I find this product very close to useless.
1,What a disappointment - no ball retention,"I get a lot of discomfort in my hands from using a trackpad, and to a lesser degree, a mouse. So trackballs are a real necessity for me. I was looking for a bluetooth trackball to use with my Apple Macbook Pro, but finally gave up. In the interim I had been using a Trackman Marble Mouse, but found it a little uncomfortable, so I decided to give the Kensington Orbit a try. What a mistake. Who thought it was a good idea to save a couple of cents by eliminating any sort of retention mechanism for the ball ? Even if I weren't planning to use this device with a laptop, I don't want to go chasing under the desk for the ball every time the device gets bumped, jostled, or otherwise upset. Maybe some keep their desk more pristine than I, but since one of the great uses for trackballs is a cluttered desk, this is one design shortcut that just doesn't pass muster. I'm returning this beast tomorrow, there has got to be a better solution than this."
4,Don't install Mouseworks if you use Breeze!,"After using non-optical Orbit trackballs for years, I just got this new optical one. I like the hardware. The great thing about the Orbit is that you can use it with either hand. I switch if one hand starts getting sore.My one gripe is that the Kensington software, Mouseworks, broke Macromedia Breeze. But once I uninstalled Mouseworks and just used whatever driver Windows XP decided I needed, Breeze worked again, and I actually liked the cursor movement better than with Mouseworks."
5,great trackball,"works great, very responsive (no delays as some reviewers suggested). allows me to use both the trackball and the touchpad on my iBook interchangeably."
2,It's OK but not GREAT,"This mouse is OK but certainly not great. It's very light, so moves around alot, The buttons are placed a little odd for easy use if your hand is placed so that the fingers can use the trackball properly. The design has tried to make the buttons look good instead of making them more useful. They are also a little hard to press for quick use because the shape gets small where my thumb would normally rest so I have to hit it just right to get it to work. It's really not big enough to hold your hand properly so you don't get any repetitive motion problems. Unless you've got really small hands, you're probably going to find yourself holding your finger joints UP so your fingertips can work the ball. My hand doesn't rest easy in that position. After several days of trying to make it work for me, I'm sending it back actually. I was replacing a well used Kensington Turbo Mouse, and find that I just need to bite the price bullet and get the Expert Mouse"
2,Unconfotable and possible wrist injury,"The trackball jumps a spot every now and then and after a while, the position of your wrist makes it painful to continue.I went back to my ergonomic Logitech."
5,"2nd kensington rollar ball, they're great!","My first kensington worked well for several years, but finally stopped working right. This model works very well. The buttons are big and don't get pushed accidently. It is stable (doesn't move around). Once you get used to a roller ball, you won't want anything else! It is well ergonomically designed."
2,Not good,This mouse in my opinion sucks. Although it has a cool design and works well it is overly sensitive. In addition the mouse buttons are on the side and designed for the thumb which i don't like. If you do a lot of precision work or a lot of clicking this mouse may annoy you very much
2,Has Problems,"I have two problems with this trackball that might not bother others. First, the left button cannot be programmed for a double click (which I am used to)and keep the right button as the usual right click. Kensington says one of the buttons must be ""click"" (single click). I have verified this with Kensington tech support. Secondly, and less of an issue, as others have reported the hand position over the mouse makes it very easy to accidentaly right click with your little finger. An annoyance."
4,acceptable substitute,"the best trackball ever made was the trackman, which isn't made anymore. this trackball is acceptable, although it doesn't support my hand nearly as well."
4,Good deal for the price.,Compact size that I was looking for. helps my mother use her computer now that her arthritis is acting up!
5,Optical Trackball Mouse,I absolutely love this trackball. I should have purchased one a long time ago. Saves on the wrist action.
3,So-So,"Pro - The device is very easy to install and configure. In fact, you can use it right out of the box. It is very precise in its movements.Con - I am finding that I continue to get cramps in my hands from prolonged use. Mainly in my fingers that are over the trackball itself. You probably need to have a hand shaped like a three-fingered alien to really appreciate this pointing device."
5,Very good product!,Awesome product that saved my wrist! Right click works and no driver necessary on the Mac. Always a pleasure to use
5,I really love it,I don't like useing a mouse and the track is excellent. I will buy another one when I need it.
3,Good product,"It is a good product at a fair price. Nothing out of the ordinary. It has a nice aesthetic design, but the trackball itself does not 'snap' in place and can be easily dislodged if tipped on its side."
2,Left Click Button Dies Early,"Works fine for the first couple of months but as I read in other reviews, the left click button begins to stick and act as if you're holding it down while you scroll. Picking the thing up off the desktop by about an inch and dropping it can shock the button lose, but it's only a matter of time - just a few clicks - until it happens again. Sad, because overall it's a nice device but as with so many manufacturers, poor quality to save a buck has doomed their product to be merely mediocre at best."
4,KVM compatible trackball,"I've got a setup that requires using a trackball; there's simply not enough space for effective use of a mouse. When I tried to use it with a KVM (keyboard-video-mouse) switch so I could work on two computers at the same time, I found that my trackball had too many features for the KVM to accept and was forced to set up a separate pointing device. The Kensington Orbit Optical Trackball Mouse was a good replacement. It is compatible with the KVM switch (as a matter of fact, I tried it with several different switches) and the ball moves smoothly. My only objection is that it is really designed for people with large hands. Fortunately, mine are... I can span 10 keys on a piano. My wife, however, is unable to maneuver the ball and use the ""mouse"" buttons comfortably. Aside from that, however, this is a good solution to my technical problem."
2,Not as resistant to use as its competition.,"I have owned trackballs since the early '90's. All my Kensington trackballs have died from microswitch failure in under a year. This particular model has metal ball support clips to complement the teflon ones but they do not resist hand acids. They rust very quicky, which makes for an uneven ball movement. This one's microswitches died after 5 months of regular use. Othere than that the software works ok and the design is ergonomically viable."
3,Kensington trackball mouse,The placement of the right button is esthetically pleasing but physically uncomfortable as it interferes with the holding of the mouse and negotiating the trackball. I continuously have to reset the menu that pops up when I accidentally touch the right button. It needs to be moved so the hand doesn't rest on it or have to be held up off the mouse to keep from hitting it.
3,Not bad. . .,"if you need a cheaper alternative to carpal tunnel syndrome. I, too have used the Expert mouse from Kennsington for as many years as the previous reviewer. I also bought a turbo-mouse. It failed, but was replaced by a Fantastic remake of the Expert, with a spin ring that serves as a scroll wheel (Thank you Kennsington!). But I found the Kensington Orbit Optical Trackball Mouse 64327, despite its high quality, a bit too light weight, literally. It was hard to keep it still during intense use. The smaller ball was also hard to keep from flipping out of its ""eye"" socket and I found my thumb reaching too high for critical left clicks.So. . . if you've never used a Kennsington Expert mouse, the Optical Trackball is probably a GREAT choice. But if you're accustomed to the perfect heft, ergonomics and ease on the wrist of the Expert, don't buy yourself short. . . get the Expert."
1,Not at all easy to use,"My hand does not rest comfortably on this trackball. I use my computer all day long for graphics, editing, web browsing, etc, and I just do not like the way this trackball feels under my hand. I do not find it at ALL easy to use both the buttons and the ball without moving my hand around, and thus my wrist gets quite fatigued, which was exactly what I was trying to avoid. I also find the buttons much too stiff, which is why I have to move my hand around so much. They need more sensitivity.I have gone back to the touch pad on my laptop. As much as I hate it, it is far superior to this trackball."
5,Awesome!,"Originally looking for trackball movement with thumb as my other trackball's connection seems outdated. But ended up going with this model as a temporary solution for the price and I didn't expect to like it much as the trackball is not located in the thumb area. But I actually like it more than I thought I would easier to use than other similar models Ive come across, I like the fact that the ball is detachable my experience with trackball mouses are they aren't the easiest to clean as they do build up dirt over time making the ball more resistant to movement."
4,Kensington Orbit Optical Trackball Mouse 64327,the mouse works great. The only issue I have is that theball falls out of the mouse easily. There is nothing to keepit in place. There is no lip to keep ball in place should ittip over.
3,Buy Logitech's trackball instead,This mouse is a much cheaper version of the logitech trackball mouse. It is less durable (very thin plastic parts/falls apart easily) and gets dirt trapped faster but will get the job done if your looking for basics and simplicity. Personally after using both trackball's I highly recommend Logitech's over this one.
4,Cool mouse!,"This is my first trackball, and I quite like it. It's comfortable to use and more low-profile than I expected. It's just a bit smaller than my hand (I have big hands), which is nice.I'm left-handed, so I have to use my pinky to left-click. This is somewhat annoying, but it's neither something I didn't expect, nor is it something that jumper wires and a soldering iron can't fix.The only complaint I have about the device is that there is a dark, patternless spot on the ball which doesn't register with the optical sensor. It is about 3/4"" in diameter.All things considered, this is a super spiffy trackball that I would recommend to others."
2,Opt for the Expert Mouse,"I tried this before buying the Expert Mouse because of the savings in cost. Unfortunately, the tiny ball, odd shape, lack of a scroll wheel, etc. made this mouse a bad purchase. Most importantly, my wrist pain from using a standard mouse didn't clear up and the shape of the mouse required me to arc my wrist in a strange way to use it. I've had the Expert Mouse for about a year now, and it is amazing. It is worth the higher price, don't bother with these cheaper trackballs. If you are ready to leave standard mice behind, then opt for the Expert Mouse."
5,The Kensington Orbit rocks!,"The best trackball unit I have ever used. And much much much easier to clean than a non-optical trackball. (I remember having to clean the gunk out of those contact points with a small knife.) Simply take the ball out and wipe the contact points and you're good to go.Excellent wrist height, good buttons. Sturdy plastic construction. And helpful software if you need it (so you can scroll up and down by clicking both buttons at the same time).The only drawback of this Orbit? The ball itself simply rests on the unit. It isn't secured to the base of the trackball in any way , so simply picking the unit up could dislodge the ball. But that's so minor an issue as to be trivial.I highly recommend the Orbit."
4,Works Well,"My old tracking ball did not have a USB connection, so I bought this one for my new PC. It works very well, although I miss the scrolling wheel that my older one had. It is still a pretty good deal."
4,Nice trackball.,"The Kensington optical trackball works exactly as described. This is wonderful if you use it on your desk. It is accurate and easy to use. The main drawback for me is that I don't use it on a desktop, but use it on the arm of my chair with my laptop. Since it is wired, I always have to find a place for it when I get up. The most annoying thing about it is the ball simply sits on the unit, with no resistance at all, so anytime it gets tipped over, the ball goes rolling away, and you have to get down on the floor and find it. I have used other trackballs that did click in, but they were much more expensive, and also not as reliable in the long term as this. I also like the feel in my hand better than any other trackball or mouse. I would definitely buy it again."
3,not as comfortable as I thought it would be,"works well, not as comfortable as I thought, when I use it I keep right clicking by accident. would be better if right click button was smaller."
5,Great for a programmer with ruined wrists.,"I've been using this trackball at home and work for over a year now. I selected this one because you can use it with either hand, and it wasn't too expensive. My right wrist hurts when I use a mouse after so many years of abuse, so I switched to the left. When that one starting hurting the same way, I went to this trackball, and it really seems to do the trick.I never liked trackballs that I had tried in the past, because the control seemed less precise than my mouse. However, I've successfully and comfortably used this trackball all day at work, then all evening at home, including playing games. Now I don't think I can go back.Without personal experience, I can't compare this to the more expensive Kensington, or the more-common Logitech, but I don't think you can go wrong with this as your pointing device."
5,Best trackball at low price,"This is one of the best trackball I've used. Being a graphic designer I've always been using trackballs, they are very convenient in using on your desk specially when you have your desk well cluttered with other items. In addition you can use a trackball on any surface, you don't have to worry about finding an even flat space to move your mouse. Comparing to various trackballs available in the market, this Orbit from Kensington is the best one at very low price and it's cosmetic outlook is also well impressive as its very precise optical tracking ability. I would highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for a trackball at low price."
5,hideously ugly but ABSOLUTELY THE BEST.,"an unquestionable monstrosity to look at, the mouse equivalent of a 70's cell phone, but it's the most comfortable and subtly responsive trackball, absolutely eliminating any arm and wrist pain to boot."
2,Parents of small kids beware,"I found this to be an okay mouse. I have gotten used to the sensitivity of the trackball in only a few days. The left and right click buttons are a little awkward and I miss having a scroll wheel. The biggest complaint is that the ball just lifts right out, and this has become an endless source of amusement for my 3 year old. Not only is it frustrating to have to go find it all the time, it could also be a danger if she were to get it stuck in her mouth."
3,It doesn't scroll,"Having owned this in the past -- and really loved it -- I ordered another one when my Mac mouse began to fail.Alas, I REALLY miss the ability to scroll down the page, using a built in wheel, button or other device.This trackball needs updating."
4,A detail...,"I don't own this product, I am shopping around. I have used a Kensington Turbomouse (now called Expert Mouse) for years. It is the larger, large ball, 4 button model... 5 stars! But I need a smaller less expensive model for an off site job.You may find it helpful to know that according to the Kensington website, when operated on OS 9 this model will only offer one button, not two. You need OSX to use both buttons. I didn't see that detail anywhere here and thought it might be helpful to some.I have to choose a star-rating in order to post this, I am choosing 4 stars as from what I have read it sounds like a great choice, minus one start for not having full OS9 compatibility."
1,Don't purchase; poor construction,"I much prefer using a trackball to a mouse and normally use Kensington devices without hassle. But I was suckered by the price on this; the unit was poorly made and the left button has a very annoying play in the mechanism. I never knew how many times I left click in a hour until, with this trackball, I could count them by the noise."
2,Ouch! Awkward!......regret.,17 year old business man doesn't enjoy this product. I do everything on a computer from graphic design to editing in excel. I DO NOT LIKE THIS MOUSE. It's very uncomfortable. The ball is too small and the whole unit wobbles out of control on my desk. Blaggh...I'm going to see if I can return it.
3,Good for the money,"I purchased this track ball for home rather than office use and it's meeting that purpose adequately. However, when I spend a lot of time doing ""mouse work"" at home I do start to feel achey in my hand due to the awkward stretch of the design on my hand.So far I have had no problems with the way it works or its quality which is more than I can say for many other track balls (non Kensington) that I have used.If you're looking for a reasonably priced track ball, this one is worth a try."
5,Kensington Orbit Optical Teackball Mouse 64327,"This is a great mouse! I have poor coordination so I need a mouse that is has a track ball and will stay stationary when I use it. This mouse does that. Yet, the mouse doesn't cost so much that my budget is way out of wack when I need to replace it.GinnDom"
2,Not as good as I had hoped for,"This is my first Kensington product. I use a Microsoft Exlporer trackball at work and really love it (even though I usually hate everything Microsoft).At home I had a Logitech trackball; one that was thumb controlled and it was killing my hand and wrist. I bought the Kensington because I'd heard a lot of positive reviews of the Kensington products.I have problems with the curser stalling, the buttons are poorly positioned and after about an hour or so of working it starts to make my hand cramp and my wrist hurt. I really wish it had a scroll wheel on it because it's awkward to hold the button and control the ball at the same time.I'm a graphic designer and constantly on my computer so this has been a real problem."
2,"Very light doesn't feel strong, ball doesn't stay in.","I guess for 20 bucks you shouldn't complain, but two things are bothering me the mouse is very light doesn't substancial and the ball doesn't stay in the housing if you move it around. It's okay, but I gotta remember not to move it around so the ball won't fall out.There is a plus though you can use it with either hand, and that is why I bought it.Al from AK"
3,"Not a bad mouse, but it needs a scroll ring","I bought this to add to my collection of trackball mice. I have the kensington expert which is a great mouse, except for the cost. The orbit optical is a fine 2 button mouse, but in todays computing environment the lack of a scroll wheel/ring is the kiss of death. For casual use it is fine and I ran with it for about a week. The biggest con at the end of it all was the lack of scroll wheel/ring.I could get auto-scroll to work in firefox by pressing both buttons simultaneously, but that was tedious.Hopefully kensington will revisit this design and add the scroll function to an otherwise fine mouse."
2,A poor substitute for Expert Mouse,"After years of using my Expert Mouse, the mechanical function began to break down. Not believing such a trackball should cost the $80+ price currently carried by the latest version, I tried this alternative from Kensington. After using the Orbit Optical Trackball Mouse for several weeks, I began experiencing wrist pain which was never there with the Expert Mouse. I have consigned this alternative to a seldom-used computer and gone back to the Logitech Marble Mouse I was using temporarily!"
1,disappointed..,"i bought this after several years using the previous non optical version which was perfect, just that the rubber rollers wore out. this optical version has too small a ball making it harder to control and stalls very often as another reviewer points out. the ball moves too smoothly too so i am now having wrist pains as i am trying too hard to control the movement. will probably get the expert mouse trackball."
3,"Not as good as i thought it would be, but decent....WARNING NO SCOLLER BUTTON","This mouse is very good quality. i have only a few things that i wish it had. It doesnt have a ring to keep the ball in place, this is not good for portability. I also noticed that there is NO SCROLLER BUTTON. it dissapointed me that there is no scoller button, but i blame myself b/c i should have noticed from the picture. It is a little ergonomic, but could be more ergnomic. It fits my hand perfectly, but my hands are small so perhaps it is not suited for anyone with a bigger hand. on the upside the optical feature works very nicely and it moves swiftly. I would perhaps suggest the ""Logitech Trackman Wheel (Silver)"" which is pretty standard and can be founf anywhere when seaching for a trackball mouse"
2,Parents of small kids beware,"This is an okay mouse. The trackball takes some getting used to because of the sensitivity, but the right and left click buttons are awkward. I also miss having a scroll wheel. The biggest complaint is that the trackball can be lifted right off. This has become an endless source of amusement for my 3 year old. Not only is it frustrating to have to keep looking for the ball, but it could be dangerous if she were to get it stuck in her mouth."
3,trackball mouse,Response of the trackball is precise. Buttons are easy to reach and also very responsive. Too bad the body is very large. It would be nice if it was a little more compact.
4,Too much drag for my arthritic condition...,"I only used this trackball for about a week and went out and bought a Logitech marble mouse like I had before. I gave the Kensington to my son...which he is still using several years later. The Kensington ball didn't roll as easily as the Logitech and I didn't care for the thumb action angle and pressure required to make my clicks. I'm sure it is fine for the average computer user...and it has held up well after may drops to the floor, but not not as easy to use for my needs."
2,Kingsington Orbit Optical Trackball Mouse 64327,This product was not satisfactory. It was uncomfortable and didn't provide the shape to make it easy to use. Hand fit was not very pleasing.
2,Kensington Orbit track ball mouse,"This mouse could be really great except for one thing. There is no freaking way to scroll down the web page. Had I know this up front I would never have purchased this product. I like the ball action, it is very accurate. The ergonomics is great! But without the ability to scroll using the mouse, the benefits are just not worth itKensington Orbit Optical Trackball Mouse 64327"
5,Goody Goody,This is my second Trackball. ...first one lasted years and years. This one lights up as you use it. One you try a Trackball you will never go back to a mouse.
4,Protect Nails,My nails were constantly peeling and breaking as a result of taking water aerobic classes several times weekly. I apply heathly hoof Intensive Protein treatment twice daily and find the damage to my nails is significantly reduced. I have tried other nail treatments for this problem but none are as successful.
5,Help for splitting nails,"I am so glad I tried Healthy Hoof Intensive Protein Treatment. I have had dry, splitting nails and ragged cuticles for years. I was embarrassed to have people see my hands and nails! In October 2010, I decided to faithfully apply Healthy Hoof twice a day. Well, it is February 2011 now and what a difference!!! My nails aren't splitting, they don't chip if I accidentally hit them against something, and the cuticles are moisturized and healthy. I used to get cracks around my thumbs during the winter, but not this year! Now I keep a jar upstairs and downstairs so I can apply the cream whenever I have a chance but at least twice a day. I don't notice any strong smell, but would use it even if it smelled because IT WORKS!"
2,It may be effective but I'll never know,"This product has such a strong and unpleasant menthol-ish odor that I will never use it. I don't know what the offending ingredient is but I would not be able to have it on my hands for any length of time. In addition, I found the texture to be unpleasantly sticky. Maybe it really works, but unfortunately, that's not for me to find out."
5,Healthy Hoof,"I found out about Healthy Hoof from a wonderful lady who gave me a pedicure while I was vacationing in Maui last year. I bought some right there, and have been buying it through Amazon since."
4,Finally rebuilding my nails,"After searching for years and buying every product for women that is supposed to stop splitting nails, this worked. What's great about it is you get tons of it (4oz) compared to women's products (0.5 oz) for half the price. Very happy."
3,BUN HEAD JET GLUE,DEBE TRAER LAS INSTRUCCIONES Y LOS USOS QUE SE LE PUEDEN DAR PARA REPARAR LAS ZAPATILLAS DE BALLET. IT MUST COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR USES.
1,Screws Don't Fit Into Holes,"I had the same problems as Girlx but after five minutes of trying to MAKE the first four screws fit into their holes, I gave up. Will return it ASAP."
2,not so sturdy,I bought this cart reading the reviews but not satisfied with it. It shakes. It is laying in one corner of the room. I have the same computer as shown in the picture. I am not very good with returns so I missed period during which you can return the cart.
2,First and last time I order from this vendor.,"Bought this as a gift. Was $23.00 - Shipping and handling was a rip-off: $27.86! Arrived a week later than Amazon had posted, with no tracking available. When I finally assembled it, there was an obvious spattered defect in paint finish on a conspicuous portion of the work surface. The list price for this was $179.00? What a crock. Last time I ever purchase a product with Coaster Contemporary's name on it."
1,Very disappointed.,"First of all, the table I received is NOT the table described in the listing. The table I ordered had a glass top. The one I got is all metal. Since I placed my order, it appears the listing has changed.Second, it arrived nearly a week after it was supposed to. Amazon had actually told me the order was cancelled and that my credit card would not be charged. Two days later I received notification of shipment.Also, the screws to attach the keyboard tray way are too big so I couldn't put it together properly. Very disappointed. And it will cost me more to return it than it would to just buy a new one at Wal-Mart."
3,MOBILE WORKSTATION,"VERSATILE, STURDY AND VISUALLY AESTHETIC. PERFECT ADDITION TO A BUSY DIALYSIS CLINICAL FLOOR WHERE FLEXIBILITY OF MOVING THE UNIT AROUND IS A BIG PLUS."
2,Devent desk,"The design looked great, and the assembly instructions were easy to understand. Unfortunately, on the piece I received, the items were defective. If they hadn't been, I'm sure I would've loved this."
3,Rating my new workstation,"I like this workstation. The desktop is smaller than I anticipated. I put a board on top of it to give me extra work space. I like thatit's a free-standing desk. It wobbles a bit, but not as much as my previous desk. I had trouble installing the sliding shelf. It's onand it works, but I don't think it's on properly. I like the way it looks, and I give it a favorable rating for the price. I plan to enjoy using it for many years to come. Thanks for offering a good product at a reasonable price that works well in a small space."
4,Wish there was a better place to place to mouse,I wish the desk had an attachment for the mouse. Easy assembly...all parts include.
4,great movies,"This is a good movie series. Although when I got mine, Scream 2's case was ruined but the DVD worked fine so I didn't complain…now I have the 4th one also."
3,"Great movie bundle, but bad transfers","Some of the transfers are pretty lacking on these DVDs. It was still fun to watch through the franchise, but if you want high quality versions look elsewhere."
5,Awesome!,The purchase experience was perfect! The films were refreshing addition to my collection. I couldn't ask for better! Thanks to the seller for having them and to Wes Craven for making the films!!
4,Nice Job,Product arrived in great shape and in a fairly timely matter. Great affordable price as well along with quality customer service.
4,Before torture-porn came...,"You can say what you want about how ""Scary Movie"" made people lost respect to Scream, but the stories were clever, and didn't depend on the gore to drive us through good suspense.This Triple Pack for fans of the trilogy like me has the three movies in separated cases, on a slip-case cover (which doesn't look as cool). The only one that doesn't get an anamorphic widescreen or spanish subtitles is Part 1, which is a shame being the best of the three movies. Anyway, good way to collect them all in separated cases for a good price, just before the 4th one comes next April."
4,Scream Triple Pack,"Love this genre, Scream is great. Funny and scary at the same time, watch regularly."
3,Good Classic Horror Trilogy (for the price),"I'd say to give this item a shot. It's cheap, and it's almost five hours of entertainment. Scream and Scream 2 were great, then came Scream 3, which was a kinda rehash of Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Go figure. All in all, it's a faily decent horror franchise, and you get it all in one colletor's set...Until Scream for comes out."
4,Buy This!!,All 3 in a boxset that is only like $15. with shipping and all then you can be caught up and ready for Scream 4 that comes out next October/December.
5,Awesome Triple Pack,"Scream 1, 2 & 3 all together awesome can't ask for anything better. i believe movie companies should do this for all series. i love this series. I Recommend it for everyone"
1,No Movies Ever Came,I have never gotten this movie and they did refund my money but as for buying again from them i do not think that will happen they are not reliable at all so if i was you i would think twice sorry but thats how i feel
3,Good,"The product was accurate and delivery date was as well....i give this user and its dependability 4.8/5I would purchase from this user again as well as recommend them to others, due to FAIRNESS in PRICING and INTEGRITY"
2,Incorrect rating,"The disc set is listed as G-rated with Amazon, but arrived as TV Y7.Don't think this series will be appropriate for my 4 & 2 yr olds who are HUGE Iron Man fans."
3,Ok,"My son loves super heroes and Iron man is no exception. This is based on a newer animated series and is ok, but definitely not one of the higher quality new series."
3,Half a good series,"The thing you need to know getting this show is that there are two seasons by 2 different head writers and animators. So you have the first season which has very poor animation. And on top of that the writing and theme song is about as low on the 80's cartoons schlock scale as you can get (despite this being made in the 90's). The characters are one dimensional and the plots make about as much sense as an episode on Ninja Turtles.Then we get to the second season. Which cleans up the animation, opening theme, and the writing putting it more on par with other 9-'s marvel cartoons such as X-men and The Incredible Hulk (which still needs a DVD release). Some the stories are based on actual comic book stories. And everything really picks up.So if you get this and find the first episode unbearable try poping in the second disc and got to the episode called ""The Beast Within"" which is the start of the second season and try from there."
5,Red Dragon deserves 100 stars!,"Thank goodness for Valentine Day gifts: my pallet said ""Thank you!"" for Somerdale's RED DRAGON, ""mature Welsh Cheddar Cheese"" with absolutely delectable Wholegrain Mustard Seed and Ale. Oh-my-goodness!! Excuse me, I must close . . . and order more RED DRAGON."
5,Extremly Entertaining And Fun For My 10 Year Old Boy,My 10 year old boy Sam loves this game I got it for him as a gift and he plays it almost every day he loves killing the roman soldiers and other beasts and he has alot of fun with it besides this he also has and likes playing. Red Dead Revolver. Grand Theft Auto Vice City. Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. Grand Theft Auto 3. Metal Arms Glitch In The System. The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction. The Simpsons Hit And Run. The Simpsons Road Rage. Deff Jam Vendetta. Deff Jam Fight For NY. GUN. Hitman Blood Money. and Hitman 2.
2,Cheap knockoff,"This is a cheap Chinese knockoff oil lamp. The first one of these I received had a cracked base. To Amazon's credit they overnighted me a replacement. The burner unit on the replacement was not assembled. By that I mean that none of the tabs were in the slots needed to hold it together. They were bent as if they had been, but obviously hadn't actually been inserted, so the upper and bottom halves of the burner were not connected at all.I ended up spending about 15 minutes repairing the incompetent assembly job. In the process I noted that all the brass colored metal pieces were very flimsy and thin.Once together the lamp functioned ok, but it's still a flimsy knockoff and you have to handle it very carefully. Time will tell if this thing holds up to actual use or not. If you want a real oil lamp that can be used then skip this one."
5,wall holders,"for anyone interested I make beautiful wall holders for this size and others including antiques. These include several choices of woods, mirror and accents. For pics email jimcyndielyon@yahoo.com. subject line-oil lamps"
1,Little People's Very Annoying Ballet,"This video was the most ridiculous attempt to teach young children ballet. My 3 year old, who LOVES to dance, was quickly bored after the first 5 minutes. ""Miss Anita"" would benefit from focusing less on herself and more on the dances and the children. Her babytalk was unnecessary and frankly annoying. I don't know any 3 year olds who talk like that, and I am truly disappointed that a ""so called"" ballet teacher would. We will be selling this video at our next yard sale."
1,Oh My God!,This is the worst dvd I have ever bought.It is sooo annoying that we had to shut it off.The host has serious issues!She has a high pitched voice that probably makes the little girls in the video roll their eyes when the camera is off.DONT BUY THIS!
4,Great Buy!,"As far as I am concerned, all of the ""18....."" series from Warner Bros./JCI, are worth every penny and more. For a DJ......VERY HELPFUL! For a lover of great rock music and on a budget.......PRICELESS! For a collector (such as I am......over 2000 cd's and adding still) here's anothe set to gather and add to the collections. Look for all of the in the series as well as the ""Masters of Metal"" set and teh ""Only Rock 'n'roll"" as well as ""Only Dance"" and ""Only Love"" sets."
5,The perfect product,"I purchased the product on the advice of my physical therapist. I will never sleep on a traditional pillow again. The roll stays in place and gives me the most comfortable sleep I have had in years. I can even sleep on my right side, which I haven't done in years. It is easy to clean and easily tucked under the decorative pillows on my bed. Thanks for a wonderful product that has reduced the pain and stiffness in my neck."
4,Great Neck Support,I am very pleased with this roll. It is firm enought to give my neck the right support. I have tried foam memory pillows and they didn't do the trick. I've been able to get better sleep since I started using this roll. It is also perfect for traveling :)
4,Good solution with one drawback,I've been using the more expensive pillow for over 17 years but switched to the McKenzie Roll for travel because of the reviews. While it worked almost as well as the pillow there is strong out-gassing which I found came from the cover not the foam. The problem is solved by washing the cover before use.
5,Original McKenzie Cervical Roll,"This cervical roll is amazing. I had one that was given to me years ago during physical therapy for my neck and back and it was completely worn out. I desperately needed a new one. The rolls fit inside the pillow case on the edge of the pillow. After finding what I needed, I ordered two -- one for my husband and I both. We are so impressed with these cervical rolls and feel we just could not sleep without them."
2,Much firmer that one I bought a few years ago,I was very excited to be getting a 2nd McKenzie neck roll so that I could have one to take on trips and as a back up. Well I was very diappointed because this McKenzie roll was so much more firm that the one I bought a few years ago. It is so firm that I can not use it so it sits in a closet unused. I wonder why the change in firmness of the foam? Unfortunately this was a waste of money for me.
1,No real help,This cervical roll was no real help. Not firm enough and it is longer than needed. Pretty much a waste of money on this one!
3,It's a little soft,"I needed something a little more supportive. It is to be used in conjunction with your regular pillow, i.e., a down pillow."
3,Not quite thick enough,"This product is ok but for ME and my neck issues (arthritis, fusion surgery at two levels - one level fusion failed) - I really need a neck roll a little bit thicker - or bigger - but NOT too big - some neck rolls I have tried in past are TOO large - and that's just as bad too. I am tall for a woman 5'8"". This may be ok for a smaller person but not working for me."
1,Excellent at first. Now more suited for keyboard wrist rest pad.,"This roll made a major difference for my comfort at night. It, among other measures, helped reduce some radiated pain due to some cervical issues.It was great while it lasted! After the first few weeks, I noticed that the roll was more compressed than when first purchased, and it remained that way as if in a permanent state. After about 3-4 months of use, it is now permanently compressed enough as to barely be noticeable, and barely makes a difference. A little semi-sticky adhesive on the bottom and it would make a better keyboard wrist rest than a cervical roll - it is more or less that flat now, particularly when under any pressure. I am currently looking elsewhere for a replacement."
1,Too Hard!,The roll is extremely hard and I am unable to use it for my neck. I would not recommend this product
2,Not worth the money.,I purchased two of these after reading the McKenzie book on neck pain. A rolled up towel works much better than this (I should have listened to my physical therapist!). The roll becomes flattened after a very few uses and does not fully regain its round shape. Not at all what I expected.
4,Good Support for the Neck when sleeping.......,"This product provides good support for the neck when sleeping.You place the cervical neck roll at the bottom of your pillow case.The product instructions recommend that you use a soft pillow.The cervical neck roll does provide good support, but it does move at times.So you will have to readjust it before you go to bed, to make sure it's in the proper position.But it does do the the job in providing good neck support.I have not woken up with neck pain since I started using the product several month ago."
1,Do not buy this roll,Save your money. This is a dishonest company.I bought this pillow for years. Then in Sept i bought three to keep for awhile and they all came in so soft and unusable. I contacted the company immediately but they refused to return my money. Master card has been fighting them for nine months to get me money mo ey back. I even spent my own money to send it back to them. So I have been out $60.
1,Wears out Quickly,"Initially, I loved this thing, after trying several options to relieve neck pain, my morning headaches were disapearring. After a month, the foam started to flatten out in the middle and it no longer provides the correct amount of support....disapointed"
1,Way Too Soft,I absolutely do not understand the reviews here that say this cervical pillow is too firm. Maybe I'm living in the twilight zone but the one I received is so soft that it completely collapses under my neck and provides absolutely no support at all.
2,Original McKenzie Cervical Roll Neck Support,"I tried to use the roll for a couple of weeks but continuously woke up with neck pains. I'm a petite person and wonder whether the roll itself is just too large for my neck, or whether I'm using it incorrectly. I may try again, or pass it along to a friend to try."
3,"5 stars for support, 1 star for odor","This roll rates 5 stars for support and one star for odor. It has helped my neck, sleep and snoring. However, the odor was untolarable. I am guessing that the odor is an antibacterial chemical because it sort of smells like the antibacterials that are on sponges, only much stronger. Since it was right against my head while sleeping this was untolerable. After about an hour of ringing it out in hot soapy water it is fine. Since this item is suppose to help a person's health, manufacturers should consider that chemicals harm human tissues."
2,Neck support might be good for some,"Before buying the McKenzie neck roll be aware it only comes in the one size, 3 1/2 inch diameter. It is worth discussing what size would work best with a physical therapist and then get the correct one. This one was too big for me and had to be returned."
3,o.k. but disappointed,"I was excited to get the McKenzie roll so quickly. My chiropractor had recommended it. While it is somewhat helpful, I was hoping the roll would be stiffer to help keep my chin above my forehead when I am laying down. It does not. It IS comfortable enough to sleep with however and I use it regularly. I haven't notice much pain relief, but perhaps it is keeping the neck pain from getting worse."
4,"Good for the neck, but had an intense odor","This is my third McKenzie Cervical Roll. This one is firmer and had an intense chemical odor when it arrived. I removed the cloth cover and set the foam roll in a window for several days. Eventually the odor dissipated and I was able to use the roll. I like this firmer roll even better than the previous ones.I keep one in my suitcase for travel. With this roll I am able to sleep on any pillow without creating severe neck issues. My neck is very tricky, a result of two front end collisions and a rear end collision and other accidents.The cover is easy to remove and launders well without shrinking.I would rate it five stars except for the odor when it arrived. It takes a little time to become accustomed to the roll. I highly recommend it if you have neck issues."
1,not worth the money,Tt lost its shape after a few week. It end up flat and under the pillow. i think its too small for most guys.
2,"Medium firm, smelly, low quality.","Even after a week, I can feel the light, large cell foam begin to soften up. I'm afraid it won't last long. The smell died down but isn't completely gone yet. So far, it is providing reasonable support."
2,ok,went flat fast and it is way to short for a normal pillow. It helped my headaches and I made a better one myself great idea poor quality and size
3,"Amazing help, to start.","This neck roll really made my sleeping a whole lot easier. To start at least. Unfortunately after several months of use, it has collapsed to a point where it is really just not as sturdy as it started. It retains the circular shape with no pressure on it, but now it flattens almost immediately after laying down with it under my neck."
1,NOT FOR SIDE SLEEPERS,"The product description said to use the cervical roll with a soft pillow. I placed it inside the pillow case, with a soft pillow, following all the instructions given by the booklet that came with it, and the product description. The product description, as written by the seller, said the product could be used by people who sleep ""on the side or back."" I am a side sleeper, and although the booklet that came with the product itself did not indicate it's use for a side sleeper, I trusted the description of the seller.By the morning, after one use, the cervical roll was indented in the middle, deformed and useless. Perhaps this would not happen if I slept on my back, I don't know. Upon examination of the insert, it is made of very cheap, weak material. I am not surprised it didn't hold up."
2,Not large enough,"This roll is not large enough to give the cervical spine the support it needs. I am a small female and I put it in the bottom of a very thin pillow, but I can hardly tell that's it's there."
1,body support roll,"Did not like this product! Much too flimsy, it did not hold its shape. Which is needed for any type of bodily support."
3,Bit too soft to provide support,I was surprised how soft this item is - a good neck support for me needs to be firmer
1,woke up with a stiff neck,"All I know is that it felt comfortable enough when I went to sleep, but that I woke up with un unusually stiff and painful neck that lasted for three days! I am actually scared to sleep on it again."
3,Cervical Neck roll,The roll doesn't really help me out with my problem. It really doesn't set very well in my pillow
3,Good Buy for the Price,"The cervical roll is a good product for the money. I think it works well if the right pillow is used. To me, the challenge was finding the correct pillow so my head wouldn't be raised too high or dropped too low."
4,The Original McKenzie Cervical Roll Neck Support #703,"This cervical roll neck support was quite nice. I put it inside my pillowcase and it gave very good neck support. I didn't give it 5 stars, however, because, it tended to move around too much, and not stay in the correct position. Therefore, I have switched to a regular cervical pillow."
2,Product had already been used,"I already like the McKenzie Cervical roll as I use it at my Physical Therapist's office, but the one I ordered did not compare to that one. It was like it had already been used for a long time. It didn't look like it, but it was too soft and did not have any support. I had to roll it in a beach towel to help at all."
4,Great relief for tired necks,"As indicated by the title, I found the roll to provide relief for my tired neck. It did take a few nights to become accustomed to it. Perhaps I should add that I purchased it at the suggestion of my doctor, who uses it herself."
2,didn't work for me,I bought this thinking it would give the neck support I need. I'm VERY picky about pillows. I tried to use this and ended up getting a cramp in my neck. Now it's over in the pillow grave yard in my closet.
1,Very uncomfortable for me,"I am surprised no one else had issues with this product. I just couldn't sleep on this, it felt too large for my neck. I ended up buying a different pillow that I am much happier with, and this got exiled to the closet."
1,Very disappointed the 2nd time around,"I had purchased a McKenzie Cervical Roll from a chiropractor about 8 years ago and it gave my neck good support. I thought it was finally time to replace it so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. I guess in the 8 years since I originally purchased the cervical roll, McKenzie has switched to some lower cost (cheap) foam. The cervical roll that I purchased 5 months ago on Amazon is now flat (not round) and does not give my neck the support I need. I wish I had not thrown out that 8 year old cervical roll. It was in much better shape than this current one."
1,The Foam is Way Too Soft,This was a waste of money for me. The foam is not firm enough to do what it was designed to do. It is low quality. Nothing like the similar products I've seen at chiropractors offices.
2,Cervical roll,Too small. Was expecting more. Possibly find a use someday?Will be more careful in the future when ordering on line.
2,Difficult to sleep on,I purchased this neck roll to help with my chronic neck pain. It does not help me and I find that it is difficult to sleep on this roll.
2,Neck pain,I don't know who can sleep with this thing. I was in so much pain that I couldn't sleep and my neck hurt for days. Good luck but everything I've ever purchased for neck pain relief has been a disappointment. This product is no exception.
1,Too Hard,I bought this a month ago. It says it can only be used with a very soft pillow and encourages you to use a down pillow. The down goes flat and then yuor neck is on this hard roll. When I roll over my ear hits into this roll and I wake up with an ear ache. There has got to be a better way. I also bought Treat Your Own Back a month ago. I've seen no improvement.
3,My review,"Good value for the price. Does what it says it will do. I sleep better now, and have fewer neck issues."
5,Things over your head,"This CD was awesome - If you feel over taken by the things of this world, this CD is for you. We can't allow things of this world to consume us. Bishop gives a scripture about God having power and authority and that All things were under his feet. Take this personal - If its under God feet - It's under mine to."
2,"good, but...","it had my favorite song ""rock the boat."" so i had to have it this cd. and the other songs are just ok."
1,Not interesting at all,Would not recommend this book to anyone unless they were studying/majoring in this field. I had to read it for Anthropology 1001 and the book was so boring. All it talks about is this woman healing people.
3,G Smart Mini 3 Digital Camera Review,"This Digital Camera is good for taking quick pics and carrying in a shirt pocket. But there's no flash, and the shutter button takes a little getting used to as it does not ""click"". Also, the subject you see thru viewfinder is always ""off center"", and there is no viewing of pics thru a rear of camera display, it is text only & tells you pics left to take. No frills, but you get what you pay for, so at [...] with shipping, I give it a generous 3 stars."
4,Reccommended for home use,"Those narrow lines of the bank provided check register are just too small for me and trying to write in the crease is too aggravating. Between debit cards and on line banking, I rarely write a check anymore and almost never carry a checkbook. I keep my Big Print register at my desk, it's a little too big to carry, and subtract my receipts as I bring them in. For on line payments there is enough room to write in confirmation numbers so I don't have to keep track of them elsewhere. There is a slit or small pouch in the back I suppose you could put a checkbook in but I use mine separately. Also, it's a ring binder so no crease to try and write in. It works great for me but I wouldn't mind if it was note book size either. Ladies may be able to fit it into a purse but I think it works best for home use. Oh yeah, it's also easier to find a specific payment. If vision is an issue for you this should be a big help to you. I just wanted a more practical, user friendly register."
3,Not User Friendly,The big print checkbook register is not set up like a normal checkbook register but the information provided did not reveal that. I find it would be easy to make mistakes because your deposit and deduction amounts cannot be entered underneath the balance in the balance column; they are to the left of the balance column. It would be easy to skip over a deposit or check deduction.
3,Unlistenable with dynamic spread to great...................,this could have been great with a sensible sound engineer. but unfortunatelythe spread between loudest and soft is so huge you can't listen comfortably at any volume.your either straining to hear or covering your ears.forget it.
4,Super,"A super fine cell phone, but Nokia should offer classes to use it. Too complex for the ordinary user... But if you do not want to carry a camera, an I-pod and a cell phone in our bag, this only device is perfect! Great camera, great mp3 and great cellphone (all in one)."
5,the very best,"I try many celphones, this is the very very best of them, tryed phones(iphone, eten m700, treo 650, a1200, etc)"
4,GREAT PURCHASE,"I bought received the nokia n95 a couple of weeks ago so I'm still discovering its features tough I always have a nokia cell phone. What I still don't know how to do is to connect to a wlan. It seems I have to read the instruction book!Anyway, great camera, gps is ok, the mp3 sounds perfect."
4,Un Gran Telefono,"Hola a todos, yo soy dueño del Nokia N95 desde hace unos 2 meses y me parece un telefono muy muy completo, El GPS funciona muy bien despues de bajarse el software de actualizacion del telefono. Solo tengo 2 pequeñas quejas del telefono la primera es que cuando filmo un video no es de tan buena calidad sobre todo cuando hago un acercamiento, y la segunda que a veces su cuelga cuando estoy usando aplicaciones en internet. Pero en general le doy un 4 sobre 5. Gracias."
2,Faulty,"I received my phone just fine, and started it normally, and it was great. Except that when I tried to use any of the functions of it, it went black. That's not exactly the kind of thing you want when you buy a phone of this price!"
3,Nokia N95,"It's a nice phone but for the price , Nokia should have done a lot better with this phone . First of all , the housing looks toy-like than the other phones that they actually manufacture for a lot less . The GPS is so basic that it doesn't even come close to the stand alone units that other company makes . If you do want a more refined GPS info , it's going to cost another $132 for the upgrade version for the phone . For this much money , it should have been a perfect or almost perfect next gen. cell phone ."
4,Very good but a high cost.,"The product is very good designed but think about the cost? If you did not have any mony const, you may buy one. Its GPS is not so good especially with its pre-installed software. You have to pay Nokia for the most GPS services. Only map is free. Its VOIP is a good opurtinity for free talk.Also visual radio, want to charge you. Be carefull!!If you had money buy a bluethooth keyboard for easy typing. If Nokia makes a mouse driver for surfing, It will be best product :)"
4,Powerful blue,"This is a terrific blue cheese, from Australia of all places. It leaves a strong, but delicious, aftertaste, with a bit of a bite. The consistency is almost like gorgonzola dolce, that is, smooth and creamy, not at all crumbly. For me, it has replaced all other blues, except I still prefer roquefort in a salad. Highly recommended - it was a hit at a holiday party, in fact I had only a couple of thin slivers left over, from a full wheel."
1,uugh!,"The author is very well versed in Azorean history, but as usual attempts to grasp at the Anglo connection with the Azoreans. Mr. ""Rogers"" wrote this at a time when the Azores were in a revolutionary mode, and made not attempt to describe the injustices that were placed upon these peoples. One sided as usual.pv"
5,Great guide to get you started in fossil collecting,"A very good guide book to get started in collecting fossils. Great advice on equipment, locations and methods for collecting. The illustrations of typical specimens are extremely helpful in identifying finds. Mr Garcia writes with a great wit and a genuine love of science. His matter of fact story telling coupled with the excitement of discovery makes it obvious that to him, science is a verb."
5,It works!,Sometimes the all natural way is best. I have a deep cavity in my wisdom tooth and this all but eliminated the pain after 2 treatments. Now I can avoid having an emergency extraction.
5,Works 100%.,"Works well. It's 100% clove oil. Smells like cloves and tastes like cloves. Will numb a toothache for about 2 hours. Then you have to reapply. Eliminates the pain so you can sleep. Google ""clove oil"" and you'll see all kinds of medicinal benefits. The kits come with little, tiny white cottonballs (about the size of a pea). Perfect for precise placement on the problematic tooth. Would buy again."
3,relieves pain,The product works well for cavities at your lower teeth but if your cavity happens to be at upper teeth then it might be a bit tricky applying it to that area.If you do succeed with the application it would relieve the pain.
4,A pleasure to use.,"I've been chopping, dicing, julienning, and otherwise using various chef knifes for more than twenty-years. This is the finest knife I've ever had the pleasure of using. Fatigue from extended use is greatly reduced by the balance and ergonomic handle of this knife. The only thing that kept me from giving it a five-star rating is that, the handle is soft. This makes it prone to little nicks and cuts from other knives if they come in contact from a busy work area."
3,A disappointment,"This book shows what things look like through a microscope. It was disappointing to me, however, in the way this information was presented. Instead of showing a photo of the item ""life size"", and then one of it under magnification, so that the reader could grasp the difference, onlyl the magnified versions are shown.And I've found an error. On page 15, in the caption for coral rings, it stays ""Corals from 400 million years ago prove that the Earth had longer days then.""In actual fact, coral rings prove that days were actually SHORTER in ancient times (by about 4 hours) ...and of course the rate of the Earth's revolutions continue to slow."
1,Trash!,I was looking forward to watching this movie. I had it on for 10 minutes and I turned it off. It was plane trash!! No plot. Nothing. No acting. This was the worse acting I have ever seen when it comes to Dakota and Kristen. I will think twice before I watch anymore movies from those two. Very dissapointed. I lived through the 70's. But they really messed up making this movie.
2,The runaways,"Was really looking forward to this, and was disappointed. I felt like there wasn't really a story there. They spent a lot of time on nothing. I love Joan Jett, but I either her story isn't worth a movie, or they didn't put the interesting stuff in here. I do not recommend it and feel like I wasted my time."
4,good movie,It is a good movie of the band but is is based on a book about the main singer. I found it to be a about not only good for the music band but also for the actors. It tells the story of how they began.
3,solidly made but disappointing,"This is one of those movies I'm a little torn over. While it is solidly made, and pays great attention to details of period and style, it's not really about the Runaways. It's about Joan Jett and Cherie Currie. Since these are the two most well-known women from the group I can understand if they'd gotten a bit more screen time, but there are three other important stories there that have been completely ignored(not the least of which is the successful, pioneering career of Lita Ford). I believe it would have been a much better viewing experience if my expectations had been different- say if the title had been ""Cherie and Joan"" or something to that effect. Over all I was a little disappointed.However, if you've never heard of The Runaways before, and you are interested in a brief and exciting period in the 1970's when rebellion was still frowned upon by the masses, then it's probably a great movie for you."
5,LOVED IT,"Great movie! I loved it a whole lot! Like, a whole lot! No, seriously, a whole, whole lot! Why don't repeated words count??"
5,LOVED IT!,Great movie!!! Great cast!!! It was one of the best musician bio ever! The only one that I can think of that was better was the one for the Doors.
3,Glad i saw it but wouldn't again,"I had heard rave reviews of this movie and was excited to see it. Several bandographies have been more gripping than this. It is somewhat educational for someone who doesn't know the Runaways history, but why is it that most historical rock movies, and this one, leave you depressed. I love Joan but considering she was executive producer it was unfair to leave Lita and Sandy pretty non-existent, when the Runaways were 4 girls not 2. Nonetheless Kirsten was impressive and her physical stance exact! I think I enjoyed Joan's commentary more than the movie itself; although she was fairly quiet throughout it, with just a few interesting tidbits. The strangest thing to me was at the end of Joan's commentary when she dedicates the movie to Sandy. With all due respect, a written acknowledgment at the finale would have been fitting."
4,This movie will stand the test of time,"I had to watch this movie twice. The first time around I had a hard time because it was so painful to watch the train wreck of sex, drugs and rock and roll that was these young girls lives. But in the end, its what happened and these girls grew up and are part of rock and roll history. As far as the acting I thought Kristen Stewart who plays Joan Jett did a fabulous job portraying her. I can't think of anyone else that could have pulled if off. I would like to see another film of Joan's later life, there is plenty of material and Kristen Stewart is still young enough to continue playing her. Everyone was quite good in their parts, even with the gloss over of the rest of the band, would be nice if someday when they are old ladies they could sit together and really tell it for histories sake, they were important piece in female rock history."
5,Loved it!!!,"The last thing I'm gonna do is bla bla on and on like I'm some junior Roger Ebert.Simply, I loved The Runaways in the 70's and I loved this movie.I thought that Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart did fantastic jobs with their portayals of Cherie Currie and Joan Jett.The only complaint about the movie I have is, after the band got record company attention,the timelines in the movie got vague and a lot was skipped over.To do it acurately the movie would have to of been another 45 minutes and that wasn't gonna happen."
5,"""The Runaways"" (2010)","Kristen Stewart is one of my favorite actress, but her acting is dull inThe Twilight Saga: New Moon (Two-Disc Special Edition)and okay inTwilight (Two-Disc Special Edition), but this movie makes up for her poor acting. I wasn't a fan of Stewart when I first saw her in the Twilight movies, I started to like her afterAdventureland, which is a really good movie. When I saw this I knew it was going to be good anyways, it starred Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds (Widescreen Edition)) and Scout Taylor-Compton (Halloween - Unrated Director's Cut (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)&Halloween II (Unrated Director's Cut)). When the movie ended, I was amazed, the movie is now #1 on my top 3 favorite movies. I saw the movie three times and I am urging to see it for a 4th, it is that good. It is an excellent movie and a must buy (when released on DVD)!!!!"
5,really good,"kristen is really joan jett and dakota is good also,i was not expecting to enjoy it but i really did.kristen is truely talented."
4,good movie,"I give it four stars cause it had a little problem in one part, it was a little scratched. But everything else is very fine and the price it is too"
5,Great acting; so many different reviews,"Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning are so fantastic in this movie. I can understand the various star ratings regarding this band, this film, and their history. I realize there was so much more to the band and the individuals that ""they"" would have to create more than one movie to cover everything. I give this movie a 5-star rating because Kristen and Dakota were dead on playing Cherie Currie and Joan Jett. I wish this movie could have been 4-hours long, or longer, filling in the incredible details. Really a great movie that we watched repeatedly. Thank you.ps: Cherie/Joan we love you, always!"
1,"Should have been named the ""Throw-aways""","Was looking for true insight into the original formation and evolution of the group... what I got instead was a bunch of crap. One of those films that you watch and realize that you just wasted over an hour of your time, and you'll never get it back! It was not good. It was not even mediocre. It could have been a good movie, it had good enough actors, but the storyline and director appeared to work overtime to make this one a huge disappointment."
1,The Runaways,This purchase of The Runaways was a total waste of money! I would not suggest purchasing the movie at all!
1,"BEWARE ""WE BE BOOKS"". SENT DEFECTIVE DVD & NEVER REPLIED BACK!","The movie is great, but WE BE BOOKS sent me a DVD that freezes on chapters 20 & 21. It is unwatchable. Ordered it around Xmastime, so wrote them about the defective chapters then. Forgot about it until recently (life gets busy) and I wanted to watch the commentary track.. then when it froze on those chapters I realized these punks never even wrote me back!! Now I wrote them again and they are still ignoring my mails."
1,Vulgarity and Obscenity Rule,"What on earth are Kristen Stewart and once-baby-face Dakota Fanning soiling themselves like whores in this movie? Is this what sick Hollywood producers do to actresses these days? Oh yes, maybe that's what today's twisted mass consumer ""market"" wants to see: the degradation of the young. You're just making another movie to capture market share, thinking that there are no consequence to your actions.If you like watching girls turn really bad by swearing their mouths with endless expletives and behaving like cocaine-snorting whores, this is one classic example of the loose, evil culture that reigns in Hollywood and Gomorrah-city California. Guess the Rebellion hasn't ended in the Garden of Eden, in ancient Babylon or in the 1970s.What you'll learn in this movie: Whore, swear, sing and Get Rich!Are we supposed to pity those whoring junkies and have kids turn to them as role-models?!This is one memorable Dakota Fanning classic:I am Sam (New Line Platinum Series)"
3,INCOMPLETE FILM,No Lita!!!! barely the film needed another 90 minutes it was like there was info but needed more it's obvious this was a Joan and Cherie film drummer bass and lead guitar player were like in the background was the singer that important? I didn't think so. And a lot of Kim. I dont know entertaining but the attention should been about the band not about a singers drug problems. Indeed the first female rock band but not the best.
2,Poorly executed telling of a truly interesting and inspiring story.,"If you have any interest in this subject pick up ""EDGEPLAY"" on DVD....the documentary on the Runaways that blows the theatrical release away. We just saw the movie and its amazing how the writer/director (blame twice) can take an interesting and inspiring and heart breaking story about this group of 5 girls..reduce it to a story about only 2 of them and still in the course of an hour and forty five minutes tell so little story. On top of that Dakota Fanning is terrible , she has none of the sex appeal or charisma of a lead singer and isn't in Cherie Curries league...bad casting. Interestingly enough Kristen Stewart does a wonderful job as Joan Jett.....commendable and really sadly wasted next to Dakota Fanning who was criminally and woefully miss cast. This movie is a joke, Joan Jett, Currie, Lita Ford, Sandy West and Jackie Fox weren't and to wait this long to do such a bad job stinks."
4,"NOT OVERLY FACTUAL, BUT A GOOD STORY","I lived through the era of The Runaways ( the 1970's ). They were good, but to pretend that they had the impact of The MC5, The New York Dolls, Patti Smith, The Ramones, Iggy Pop and The Stooges, The Pogues, or The Sex Pistols ( or even the more mainstream Blondie, and later the Clash ) is ludicrous. Don't get me wrong, I loved Joan Jett, and their story is interesting, but not all that different from many decent bands- both then, and now.That said, the acting is excellent by Stewart, Shannon, and Fanning ( and who woulda' thought Stewart had the kinda' chops to play Jett after portraying a listless 'Barbie' to a vapid Ken-doll vampire...). It's not as good as THE DOORS, and certainly nowhere near as epic as SID AND NANCY, but it's very watchable."
4,Well worth a viewing!,"The Runaways tells the story of the girl rock band from the 1970s of the same name. Of course it touches upon the turbulent friendship between Joan Jett and Cherie Currie as well as the relationship between the group and Kim Fowley. Like most movies based on a true story, there isn't much plot to describe. However, the movie raises a lot of issues that are perfect for discussion.Overall, I must say that this is the best role Kristen Stewart has ever had. I can honestly say that it was wonderful to see her in this movie. I was not as impressed with Dakota Fanning's performance which I found to be stilted at times. Overall I thought that she did a good job, but her connection to the character seemed to go in waves where sometimes she was completely in tune only to lose the spark soon after. Still, Stewart (and Michael Shannon) were more than able to carry the movie when Fanning faltered."
3,Quark review.,I did not order this but I would like to have it for German cheesecake.I like the price for the product but not the S&H; fee.If you travel to Germany you pay hardly nothing for Quark and this is only 8 ounce. I would like to have the s&h; cheaper so I can order it often.
3,Not so impressed,"I ordered this system mainly for the wireless surround speakers. The system looks cool, and works ok for movies as well. But for listening to any kind of music, its simply does not do a good job. The subwoofer is so so with the bass output not as good. If you are looking for a system with wireless rear speakers and mostly just for watching movies, then its a good bet. I exchanged mine for a Onkyo home theater system since I needed one that I can play music on as well."
2,Looks good .... BUT....,"As with the other reviews, I bought it for it's design and wireless rear speakers feature, and it's a Sony, so it must be good! Ha!The CD/DVD player is in fact the worst I've ever seen, and I've had a few over the years. I would much rather have a single disk system that works well, instead of this 5 disk system that gets 'lost in space'... It's extremely s.l.o.w and frustrating to use. I've owned this unit for over a year and my wife still won't touch it, as she see's the frustration I go through everytime I use the CD/DVD player (or try to anyway). The sound is only middle of the road ... not worth what I paid.Sorry Sony ... never again, there's too many other units on the market !"
1,Basically junk,"I bought this system a year ago, a family gift for Xmas. Christmas Eve this year, it swallowed a rented DVD and wouldn't let it go until I attacked it with screwdrivers. Now it seems to work again, but I'm going to dump it in the trash anyway.Basically, it's a piece of junk:1. The sound is like it's coming up from a pool of mud.2. The DVD player is slo-o-o-ow, and the control over DVD playing poor. My $69 Toshiba DVD player is worlds better mechanically.3. The whole system is made up of proprietary components, so if you decide on a new amp/receiver/DVD player, you're out of luck. The speakers have to go too. Maybe it's all for the best.Mine is out the door tomorrow morning. I'm only afraid this may be a discontinued model, and no one will have the chance to benefit from this opinion."
1,DONT DO IT !!!!!!!,The biggest mistake I ever made. The disc changer is painfully slow. Its nearly impossible to get the dvd to eject and it takes forever to put a movie in and switch to a empty spot. It says no disc and goes to one that has a disc. I KNOW theres no disc! Im trying to put one in. This system has caused me so much aggrevation and frustration. My sister owns one and hates it too. I should have listened to her when she said not to buy it. Spend a couple hundred more and dont get this one!!!!!!! I wish I did.
3,A good overview of Scottish cuisine,"I just recently caterered my husband's 30th birthday party with a Scottish theme. I found ""A Little Scottish Cookbook"" to have well laid out traditional recipes that were easy to prepare. However, after buying a few other cookbooks on the subject at the time, it's pretty standard. If you're looking for the standard bill of fare in Scottish recipes this is it."
5,This Particular Book,My aunt has a copy of this book and I had been searching for one high and low. This book is very accurate with dream definitions. If you believe in dreams this book is for you.
5,there's treasure everywhere by buu,It's a great book and got here in perfect conditinons.MY only complai is that amazon gave me a deadline and the product only arrived five days later....
2,the extra star is for the pianist,"Hi, I am Thomas Hampson. I am a self-promoting opera singer. I fancy myself quite the musical scholar and historian. It really is all an overwhelming illusion, in order to protect my image. I really don't know mcuh about this material, but I can sure talk a good game. See how I pose on the cover with my glasses, looking oh so academic and astute? A picture is worth a thousand cd sales, aint it? Ka-ching, ka-ching! Listen to how I caress each word and note with just the right amount of bluff and bluster. Hermann Prey is rolling over in his grave, but that's ok, as I have picked up the gauntlet and am thrashing anyone who buys this album with it. Ha, ha."
2,Not as good as the actual TCG,"In the game, you take control over little miniatures shaped like familiar monsters from the YGO TCG, and control them with the rolls of little dice. However, the game takes an extreme amount of strategy, and it's really annoying to get monsters onto the field. Everything is controlled by Crests, and if you don't have enough, it is not well.If you like strategy games, then this won't disappoint. But if those types of games confuse you, then I reccomend the actual TCG"
5,"DDM IS THE BEST GAME EVER ,EVEN BETTER THAN YUGIOH!!!",I THINK THAT THIS GAME IS ALOT BETTER THAN YUGIOH TCG CUZ U ACTUALLY HAVE TO THINK ON URE FEET. I ALSO JUST LOVE THE DICE. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF DICE GAMES AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS PERFECT SINCE IT HAD MY FAV. CHARACATERS IN IT FROM THE CARD GAME.I WAS ALSO LOOKIN FOR A PLACE TO BUY BOOSTER PACKS TO BUILD MY ARMY. ... I ALSO WANT TO RECCOMEND THIS GAME INFINETE PERCENT. EVEN WITH ME BEIN A TOP DUELIST IN MY AREA I STILL SAY LONG LIVE DDM!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Acceptable, but wish for something more...","It is a holster. That's about it. It fit my SRH with scope, as well as my friends SBH. I would highly suggest removing the flap cover if you don't anticipate rain/snow - the snap is not only very noisy to un-snap, but rattles around when it is unsnapped. Stalking or sitting in a stand it is definitely noisy. Straps came adjusted for a tiny little person and I found that I had to ""reconfigure"" the straps to make it fit a normal size person. If you are a big person, you may need to add a strap. The belt loop attachment didn't work for me or my friend, as it just made it more uncomfortable. The neck strap will cut into your neck after a while, especially while walking.Overall, I still give it 3 stars, simply because it did work, and wasn't as expensive as some of the others on the market. If I had it to do over again, I would maybe save my money for a more expensive but better holster."
3,Kykid,"Good quality material used to make this holster. The problem I had with my S&W 460, is the revolver is too big for the flap to snap shut. There is a strap that you can use to secure the gun in the holster, however if they had just extended the velcro on the back of the holster, the flap would cover and close on any firearm. I will have to find some velcro and figure out how to attach it to the thickest part of the holster to fix mine."
2,Not a good choice,"TheFujifilm Finepix F40fd 8.3MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver)fits into the case but it is not practical. The strap (inside) to secure the camera just fits and its a pain to secure the camera. The easiest way to use the case is to leave it loose inside but with the double zipper system, it falls out too easily when the case is opened. Therefore, it is not practical like a conventional camera case that opens from the top. Furthermore, the belt clip is secured with a metal rivet that can be easily exposed on the inside of the case. It is covered by a bit of material but in my case, it wasn't attached properly with glue and hence it flaps loose. It came off within the first day. The exposed metal will scratch the camera and the screen.I award this case 2 stars because faults apart, it is a good protective cover. Personally, I regret the purchase."
2,Incorrect size,"This camera case is not the right size for the Fuji Finepix F31fd camera. If your idea, as was mine, is size - that's why you got this camera in the first place - then this case is the wrong buy. It's just too large. Go to Circuit City and look at similar cases half the size, which fit snug, no movement for the camera."
4,Great little case,"I love this little case. It protects my camera very well, the clip on belt attachment is very handy and there is plenty of room for the USB cable hookup in the case as well.My only problem is that it did not come with the promised screen protector."
2,Okay for kids maybe...,"The narrator sounds like a softer version of Cyndi Lauper in her almost cockney british accent. She repeats her descriptive words such as ""gossamer wings"" then moments later ""gossamer gown"", and ""electric blue"" then ""electric pink"" as if she ran out of adjectives.The background music is great, and has nice birds chirping happily away behind the flute which ebbs and flows rhythmicaly to the narration.I suppose I just found the vocabulary and twangy accent distracting. If you live in south London, and are under twelve years old, you'd love it."
2,A miserable affair that makes killing Nazis lethally boring,"Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict -- ""I'm on record defending Uwe Boll's original Bloodrayne. You can look it up. I argued that if Boll's name wasn't attached to it, most people would probably chalk the film up as a trashy, gory B-movie guilty pleasure. Now, having endured this clot of a follow-up, I'd like to formally retract my goodwill. Boll found a way, turning in a talky picture that eschews sustained action for overlong dialogue between Clint Howard and Michael Paré. In between these jumbo expository exchanges--delivered with line readings that would make an adult film star laugh derisively--you have smatterings of action and sleaze. There's plenty more stupidity to delve into, but I'll spare you. All that needs to be understood is this: the action is terrible, the acting is laughable, the T&A is too ridiculous to titillate, and Rayne never wears form-fitting leather."""
1,Awful,Slow movie with cheap actions (animated gun fire and blood). Weird camera movement for no reason. Dialogues between actors are very unusual. Doesn't flow or sound natural.
1,I would give this zero stars if I could.,"I figured it would be a bad movie, but at least a hilarious bad movie. Just terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible."
2,Sigh...,"Okay - the first two movies were pretty bad. Yet Uwe Boll decided to march on with a third film. I'll admit that the third movie is actually a little bit better than the first two, but given how bad the first two were, that's not saying much. Stick with the video games if you like Bloodrayne."
1,"BloodRayne; BAD,BAD,BAD","I bought all 3 of the bloodrayne movies at the same time, because let's face it a ""B"" movie has certain ""things"", t&a ect. that are a mindless pleasure, good for a few hours of no brain needed watching. But this group of ...( how the heck did they find someone dumb enough finance these) the worst movies I've seen in a while. Two of them never finished playing before they hit the round filing cabinet followed by the third one. So save your money (sorry Amazon) don't bother."
2,The worst (so far),"Set during WWII Natassia Malthe reprises her role as Rayne based not on her ability to act, but her Bra cup-size.Michael Paré has fallen to new lows, cast as Commandant Ekart Brand. Very early in the piece he's splashed in the face with Rayne's vampire blood and finds that he has become a vampire. He works with mad scientist Doctor Mangler (Clint Howard) (poor pun on Dr. Mengele) to make other soldiers into vampires.Rayne must fight them all.There's a small skin sequence as she gets on with a hooker in a brothel, and another with a resistance fighter in the back of a truck. That's it."
1,Major Disappointment,I enjoyed the first two BloodRayne films - this one had potential - but it was never realized. The story never really develops and the acting all the way around is just down right BAD!!!!! I really wanted to enjoy this film - but I did not. I wasted $13.00 on this film - I want my money back!!!!!! : (
1,Don't bother,"Wow, this was 1 hour, 12 minutes I'll never get back. The only good part was the short lesbian sex scene. This movie is so bad they needed to stoop to that. Even the music wasn't played by a real orchestra. It was all synthesized. It's basically a freshman A/V student's wet dream. I hope he got a good grade."
3,Third Reich's the charm?,"Ok I really did not care for the first Bloodrayne or the second, so why did I watch the third? Well the third movie finally falls into the nazi era like the video game, which in itself to me was a plus. This is a typical B movie action/horror and fans of the genre will most likely enjoy watching this for the ""B"" factor. I feel this is the best of the three movies and it is watchable and somewhat enjoyable without being painful. This an ok movie and nothing more, its nazis, vampires and blood, what more could you want. With a little more effort Bloodrayne 3 should have been as great as the cover looks. -=Parents use caution when allowing children to view this film there is some strong sexual material=-"
3,A better vampire exploitation flick than most,"I've seen altogether too many vampire exploitation flicks. The Lost Boys sequels are definitely worse (e.g.Lost Boys: The Thirst), but that certainly doesn't make this art. High points: campy fight sequences, plenty of skin if that's what you're looking for, and a few very decent actors. Down side: some really awful acting from some and a script that keeps trying to reach way above its capabilities.I'd recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the genre, just don't expect continuity or a great deal of logic when it comes to the vampires."
4,sexy story,I like this movie much better than the 2nd. Rayne in all 3 movie is a different gal. But in the credits they list her as the same person. If you played the game it seems they are trying to follow the story a little. My one wish is the story would have been longer in one of two ways: one the expand on what they did in the movie or two they keep going with the story to meet Hitlar.
2,Seriously stop bashing this wonderful video game character!,Ugh.... I had high hopes for this movie. I love the video game and the character but this movie wasn't very good at all. I can see why it was released to DVD and not theaters.
4,better than the 2nd.,coulda been better. just adding more words to this list because they want me to keep talking and I dont.
5,My son thinks this game is great!,I received this game in perfect shape! I am very pleased with the seller and the game. The game was a gift to my son for Christmas and he plays it all the time!
2,It's the worst LOTR game ever.,"The only thing I hate about it is the most basic thing in the game,Fighting.You have to go and take turns and theres no actionat all."
1,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is the most bullshi* I have ever seen. I di not like the combat. You take turns to attack. I played this Motherfu**** game for 5 minutes and hated it. Dont buy this game. I wasted 50.00$ on it. You would probrably end up destroing it. I would give this game a dam* 0 if i could. Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssssssse dont buy this game.
2,Would rather eat Warg droppings than play this anymore,"I had very high hopes for this game and went out to buy it as soon as it came out. Now that I've been ""playing"" it I have some major gripes...This game is beyond what I would call linear, you are confined to a set path, unlike KOTOR where you ran around zones, here you run down paths. Dreadful.Combat looks stupid. All the fights seem predetermined. When you enter combat a large loud annoying ""start of combat"" screen pops up. You decide your attack, you execute your attack, then you run back to where you were to stand like an idiot waiting on the enemy to attack you. I just can't get over how bad that looks.What it boils down to is that there is little to no exploration and all the game is is a series of battles you run too. Rent this thing if you have to play it."
5,excellent collaborations,"this album shows that, when given something to work with, some actual content from his collaborators, amon tobin can make some incredible music. this is shown in the first few tracks of the album. the remixes are the truly great part, taking the only good song from ""out from out where"" (which was already heavily influenced by prefuse 73) and hearing the unique styles of four great musicians interpret it. The songs have very little in common, aside from the requisite sample cut-up vocals. prefuse does what he always does, with weird tones and unmatchably creative beats. topo gigio puts on heavy atmosphere and creates an enveloping, dramatic song, also the most true to the original. kid 606 turns it into dancehall, and screws around with every element of the song as much as possible, making a fun short-attention-span piece. and of course boom bip brings in some real instruments and gives the album some class. this is the best cd i've seen in a while."
4,One-ups the remix album,"Impressive compilation/collaboration from one of the most creative, aggressive, and intelligent electronic artists out today, flies by despite the repeated remix of Verbal, due the the inspiring array of interpretations, mixed with the first half of originals, also hitting the mark, as is usual for Tobin."
4,STILL GROWING ON ME!!!,"I only found it fitting to get this CD being that it beckoned me everytime I would enter the ""Dance"" section at Borders, and since I have become an Amon Tobin fan. ""Hey, $10--what do I have to lose?"" So I got ""Collaborations and Remixes""... right now, though, I'm feeling somewhat indifferent as to whether I like the material here or not...some of the music like the opening ""Untitled"", ""I'll Have the Waldorf Salad"" and the ""Verbal"" remixes do have Amon Tobin's signature orchestra- meets-cut'n'paste D&B touch, but in comparison to his material on the classic ""Bricolage"" and ""Supermodified"", this ""remix"" CD is ""common""! But then what remix CD really grabs you unless it's Herbert's ""Secondhand Sounds"", but that's a whole nother review. Definitely get ""Collaborations and Remixes"" if you're fond of Tobin's work and the producers and DJs who have collaborated with him. However, don't expect to be blown away by anything that hasn't been done before."
5,Stunning Photos & easy to follow text,"This book is a 'must read' for anyone who is coming back into horses, has never had them or ""knows all there is to know""!! It is an easy to read and follow text with excellent photos which captivate the reader from start to finish. I have had horses for years and learned new things and was reminded of things I should have remembered. In other words it helped me to look at things in a new light and and gave me another perspective on reading our much loved companions body language, to understand and not chastise for their way of doing things. This book will appeal to all diciplines, not any one in particular. Highly recommended."
5,the new improved missy elliot,whats up peeps this si ya girl juliet and i just wanna put afew words in here about my girl missy mistermenor elliotgirl you was so bad built but look at you now since you look so good now your gong tobe the next beyonce fa show
2,This Is A Disappointment!,"Ok, Missy changes her style as usual but you can tell this album is not her! The tracks, the beats and everything aint the same because it wasnt just her and Tim who produced them but some other people. This is her worst album up to date... What happened to her??? This album isnt ^*#! but its jst a disappointment! I was highly anticipating this album and it wasnt worth the time! I think Missy rushed the album, she can do heaps better!"
3,Missy Very Creative,"She put alot of creative rap songs, love songs, & a gospel I'm Not perfect song which i love when she makes a song with the clark sisters. I love about five songs pass that dutch, So Real( which included background vocals by Misha(702-702- Lead singer Album 98) toys is a very funny song that i thought a side of missy i would'nt see. Spelling bee is a very creative song i know i took a while to put that together. Missy has a new style to her music with her New Image. listen to the samples before purchasing."
2,She should have tested this first,"I have followed Missy career from her debut until now. I must say that with Missy latest effort ""This is not a test"" and her prior""Under Construction"" were horrible. It seems Missy is really relaxed and feels that a fall off cannot happen to her.Please don't get me wrong she has a few tracks on this disc but overall it really seem thrown together and rushed. Her lyrics are really outdated and her tone in her voice really drags around the whole disc. This is sad because Missy has true talent but on this and her prior CD overall the Album are trash. I really feel I wasted my money. She has 2 may feature artist on the Cd and Missy cannot Col with just any artist.I hope she can give me another CD like So addictive or She's a B@#4h ,or I will find myself buying her Cd BOOTLEGG..........."
2,A RUSHED MESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this album was rushed and is a mess.... take your time next time missy.... Quality is better than Quanity..... it was not your time yet to drop another album.... cause this is some mess... SHE WILL BE LUCKY TO EVEN GO GOLD WITH THIS ALBUM.... TRUST ME BY THE SPRING OF 2004 THIS ALBUM WILL BE IN THE REDUCED RACKS AND IN A DISTANT MEMORY....email me with your thoughts at he2sexy@aol.com
3,WHAT HAPPENED MISS?!!??,YO MISSY MY GIRL AND ALL BUT I WASN'T QUITE FEELIN THIS ALBUM!!I THROUGHT SHE WAS GONNA BANG ON HURR BUT SHE DIDN'T!!COME ON MISSY U GOTTA STEP IT BUT HEY THEN AGAIN THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT TIME!!
2,One of the worse albums in 2003,"Missy Elliott's CDs are getting worse and worse. I love her so much mainly because of her ""Da Real World"" then ""Supa Dupa Fly"". I purchase her album once it is released without any hesitation but she disappoints me again and again. Her last one ""Under Construction"" is a poor CD. I can't find any outstanding song from it. (But it is nominated for Grammy's Album of the Year...weird) And the new one, ""This is Not a Test"" is so bad that I cannot imagine. Dear Missy, when will you make another ""Da Real World""?? I am looking forward to that"
4,Still hot--maybe too much overexposure? new direction?,"This album seems to be getting mixed reviews...but, even though it may not tread any new waters, it's still a fun, top quality record, and I LOVE ""Is This Our Last Time."" It's funky, 1980s-type soul, makes me think of Patti LaBelle. I also LOVE the ""Ragtime Interlude,"" - it seems to hint at a wealth of possibilities. Missy, you should chill from making un-melodic ""Work It"" re-writes (like ""Pass That Dutch""--yes, it's fun, but it's hardly anything new, and it flopped on the charts). Girl, take your talents to the next level and explore that delicious singing voice you have (take a cue from Queen Latifah--she succeeded and now she's an Oscar-nominated actress!). It's time for hip-hop, and popular music in general, to change..."
2,Big letdown...,"after Under Construction (which is one of my favorites). I mean come on, ""Let Me Fix My Weave""???? What the f is that? This album was put out just to put it out, it seems like there was no real effort to be creative. If Missy waited at least a year to put out another album, I know it would have been hot, but this one is very, very played out. I mean, she's just been everywhere lately, in the Monica video (the whole Monica album too..), Timbaland & Magoo video, Fighting Temptations video... Take a break! I'm tired of seeing you! I'm sorry but I was just not feelin this album."
2,washington's finest/the truth,this albub i felt was okey don't know if it is worth the 15$ dollars. my advice is wait till it goes on sale. This album I felt was overlly animated and definetly not missy's best.I mean half the time I didn't have a clue on what she was even rapping/singing about.
1,A FAILED TEST AT MAKING GOOD MUSIC.,"I honestly dont understand why missy is so popular in the hip hop world.She really sucks and her music sounds like the type that only a small child can appreciate because its so cheesy and corny.She is only furthering stereotypes that black people are ignorant and ghetto with songs like "" dats what im talking about"" and ""toyz"".The music is corny and cheesy,not one good song in the album.This fat and ugly lady does not possess a single ounce of talent in her body and is making money off of alot of ignorant people who are too young to have developed a good ear for real music.Her voice sounds ridiculous and she is as ghetto as one can get.Alot of people will call me a hater but im just speaking the truth about her music.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!"
1,SHE Flunked this test!!!,"Very bad, and it's no surprise that it droped out of the charts Faster than a Milli Vanilli remix album! She can do better and I hope she does. But this was just flat out bad!!!"
1,What A Waste!,"I am SO diappointed that I purchased this CD. I have bought all her CD's the day they come out and this one was no different. I was so looking forward to this CD, especially after hearing ""Pass That Dutch"". Boy was I mad! This is a horrible CD. Missy should have waited a while longer to make a new CD and maybe it would have been of better quality. The song ""Dats What I'm Talkin' About"" with R. Kelly is the most wrong thing I have ever heard. ISH! It sound like an old Prince song...they're both singing SO high pitched that it is just painful! Besides ""Pass That Dutch"" there are only 2 other songs I like on this CD......""I'm Really Hot"" and ""Let It Bump"". The rest is just TOO old school sounding...she made that statement of Hip Hop roots on Under Construction......time to move on, Missy!"
4,"This message is for ""Rap is poor music""","Though I'm not a big fan of Missys, I thought this CD was fun. Her music is for the club scene to make you dance and have a good time. It is not intended to make a big political or moral statement. I have heard plenty of rock and hard rock songs that I can only describe as noise at best. You sound as if you have something personal against our culture not just the music. And your immature comment about her being fat and ugly had no bearing on whether the CD was good or not. Stop being so closed minded."
2,3 good songs 4 max,It seems the only good songs on this cd are the ones they promote into singles the rest are lame overused beats that you would expect from someone like mace or some other sucktaclular rapper it doesnt seem like either A. timberland didnt do as much work on this record as he has in the past or B. he didnt give a flying F about it now there are some tight songs like ragtime/hot and pass the dutch but the rest arent worth the money it took to record them my suggestion is to burn it from someone or off the internet its not worth the money
2,"Not as good as her previous work, but","Out from the ashes comes ""Pass That Dutch,"" possibly the most hard-hitting club thumper she's ever done. I listen to it constantly. Her diss of fat people is rather laughable, though, considering the fact that she used to be a tub 'o lard herself (she's still kind of pudgy). That aside, though, the club-friendly beat of ""Dutch"" will get anyone out on the dancefloor. ""I'm Really Hot"" is so-so but kinda weird, ""Wake Up"" and ""I'm Not Perfect"" have messages to send, and ""Toyz"" is funny. But other than that....this is all filler. The lyrics also sort of tick me off, Missy has been getting irritatingly cocky ever since she lost all that weight. She doesn't seem like the kind of person I'd want to meet anymore. But maybe I'm just talking about the songs that got radio airplay, cuz they're always the b!tchy ones. ""Pass That Dutch"" is awesome, but she has far better albums."
3,NOT HER BEST BUT SOLID,"One of the reasons why I love Missy is because she's so unique. Missy is one of the only female rappers in the game that brings forth her own style and originality. This album is not her best work but it's good and of course it was certified platinum. This is Missy's fifth album which I think now she's taking a break and doing a new reality show starting early 2005. Overall, this album is good and can stand on it's own. GOOD JOB MISSY."
1,Just About Over,The industry rap promotion continues with this lastest disc from Missy. Too bad her production didnt turn out a radio hit with this one..she's alreay on fumes and should be over by this time next year..repalced by an 'American Idol' winner for sure
4,"Not legendary, but a solid album on its own.","Alright, I'll say it: This is not Missy's best. (Personally, I hold So Addictive as the gold standard for her albums, subject to change without reason.)The first time I listened to this album, I felt like I would have been better taking $15 and lighting it on fire. But the other day, I popped it back in. This time, it caught with me. So give it at least two spins before hitting eBay. The whole album flows, making you never want to touch the shuffle button. The only track that I'm currently not liking is ""Toyz,"" but that may be personal bias. But overall, it's worth buying."
4,missy rox,"this album rox i would give it five stars except for all of the slower songs kinda suck, but otherwise my favorites are pass that dutch, keep it movin, im really hot, dont be cruel, and let me fix my weave. buy this album it is worth it."
4,Good price; good product,"Glucosamine products are all over the map, at least some of them advertised somewhat deceptively (e.g. tab size and number of tabs rather than the actual daily dosage makes it difficult to compare). I purchased from this supplier because the product was branded, honestly advertised, and competitively priced. I can now add that it was promptly delivered. I will use this supplier again when needed, for this as well as other OTC meds."
2,Not the biggest fan,"I bought this product looking at the label. It seemed that I wasn't the only one that was fooled. Since I bought it, I stuck with it. Taking it for about a month I realized that my pain had decreased slightly. I had expected the effect to kick in sooner. Since I don't always take glucosamine supplements everyday of the year, I would prefer a product that takes less than a month to take effect. On top of that, I found an article about coated tablets vs. capsules. It seems that much of the contents in a coated tablet aren't even absorbed into the body whereas capsules have a much higher absorbency rate and are quicker to take effect. After I ran out, I didn't buy anymore Schiff Glucosamine. I use another brand after searching google called Vitamin Boat Movexa. Basically, it is in capsule form and works well for me (it took 1 WEEK to start working!). And no label needed to trick the customer."
5,recommend,I was bought this product to your wrist.Gave a lot of pain in the wrist disappears.I will have to continue taking this product.
2,HELPS THE JOINTS BUT CAUSES PHOTOSENSITIVITY,I Have been taking this brand for awhile. I finished one bottle and have to buy another one. However I stopped taking it since I started to bruise easily and all of a sudden my arms were ithing and burning. I wanted to scratch till I tear the skin. Anyway the only thing I could point to is Glucosamine. Try Hyaluronic acid instead and always take a break from any supplement.
5,This stuff really works,"Schiff Glucosamine Plus MSM - 200 Coated TabletsMy wife has bad knees. She's been taking this for about 30 days. She said that she could tell a difference after about three weeks, the pain seemed to be less. The tablets are easy for her to swallow and she has trouble swallowing a number of pills.Gunner September, 2008"
5,Very Helpful.,"I have really bad joint pain do to my weight & let me tell you, this product has worked wonder's for me!"
1,One Star Only for Deceptive Labeling!,"Do not be fooled by the 1,500 mg declared on the label, nor by the statement on this product page that a ""dosage"" is two tablets! These are in fact 500 mg tablets, and on the jar the label declares that 3 of them is the standard dosage.I really can't say whether glucosamine ""works"". At age 68, I don't have joint problems but I can't even contemplate my life if I did. I'm a musician; stiff fingers or painful elbows would put an end to my career. Some doctors whom I respect have suggested that regular doses of 3,000 mg daily might be useful for preventing arthritis-like degeneration, so that's what I take, a ""coated tablet"" version of Pascal's Wager.The stuff is expensive! So I'm always keeping my eyes open for better prices, and this deceptive labeling by Schiff fooled me.... once!"
2,do not buy anything from Board Games SuperStore,I got this piece it was cracked and broken I have sent an e-mail to Board Game SuperStroe informing them it was damaged with no response. I am VERY disappointed the game is a blast to play when the train hub is not damaged.
5,Great addition to Mexican Dominoes fun,"This is a great addition to your Mexican Dominoes set. Adults and children alike love pushing the the cho cho when they start a train. You have to mess around with the batteries some, because out of 2 of 5 sets I ordered...one I had to jiggle the batteries to get it to start and the other had them put in directionally wrong..so don't freak if your set doesn't work. Try the batteries."
4,Short but Good,Shadow Zone is better than their other 2 albums. The beat and lyrics are a lot better. The only complaint I have is that it is too short. Each song is only about 3 minutes but other than that it's great.
1,Static X = Garbage & Todd Holzapfel is the MAN,"i would rather jam away to todd on a guitar with an asian for a singer than static-x. This cd is terrible, Todd Holzapfel is the definition of Rock N Roll and good hygiene.ROCK ON TODDOBSTACLE CORPSE IS THE SHIZZLE"
1,Selling Out At It's Best.,"If a band could get a Grammy for selling out Static-x would win band of the year. This album is everything the mainstream record companies are selling, Pop for the jaded generation. I'm a huge fan of their first two and it leaves me wondering when they'll start writing music for their hearts instead of for their wallets."
1,this sux,some friend of mine was braggining on about how good this band where so try the out i borrowed his cd i tried to get into it but its impossible since all the songs sounds the same and all the riffs are a bit dumb to be honest i think this album lacks imagination i think especially because of wayne statics vocals witch i do not enjoy this is my first expierience of the band it wasnt a good one im not furmilliar with there previous work but they must be able to do better than this
3,Enjoyable to a nu-metal acceptor...,"Those of you who know nothing about Static-X but listen to bands like Slipknot or any related bands should listen to this album. You will surely like it. However, to the real metal fans, this just won't do it. The god-like elements of Static-X are completely gone. I also have ""Start a War"" which is an improvement but doesn't live up to WDT. IMO, Static-x just needs to add a lot more techno/keyboards and Wayne needs to start growling again. In ""Start a War"" it's evident that he does still have those lower vocals, but chooses to use the higher ones. A combination of techno/industrial riffs and growling is what made this band good to me."
2,"I hope ""Start A War"" is better","I've had this album since its release and I feel that it was a big let-down. Machine was weak and this CD I feel is weaker yet. Everyone keeps mentioning ""electronics"" in this album, however, there is almost nothing electronic about it. Where is all the synth and sampling as on Wisconsin Death Trip? Some of you need to go listen to ""Love Dump"", ""Trance is the Motion"" or ""December"" on WDT and then any track on Shadow Zone and then come back and talk about just how electronic it is.Thats my biggest gripe. That to me was the one trademark item that made Static-X stand out from all the other crap from the late 90's. Now, they just sound like all the other left-overs from the late 90's that are still recording."
2,What went wrong?,"I first got into Static-X when I heard Machine. The reason I liked it so much was because they were a metal band that wasn't trying to sound like Korn. They were doing their own thing and kicking ass at it. But on Shadow Zone Wayne Static just ends up sounding like f'in Davies and that pisses me off. If you want good metal go buy Machine, you'll be a lot happier"
2,wisconsin death trip it's not...,"static-x has gone downhill since wisconsin death trip. that album was simply amazing, machine was so-so, and this is crap. it sounds as if they are trying to make more mainstream friendly, less rockin' music...and it fails miserably. generally, i like their blend of industrial and metal...but they seem to be moving towards more industrial, and less metal."
3,"""We've entered a Shadow Zone"" - Machine","`Shadow Zone' is a far cry from the original guttural sounds of Static-X's first album. However, while there are definite changes and differences in the bands style and sound, Static-X have by no means `sold out'.One very noticeable difference is the way which Wayne Static sings - sings being the key word. The brutal snarls off the bands previous work are all but gone, replaced with - an albeit still gravely - set of vocals that wouldn't be out of place on a Korn album. This can possibly be attributed to Static's time working with Jonathan Davis, of Korn, on the `Queen of the Damned' soundtrack.This change is no detriment, of course, but some fans of the bands heavier work may feel as though things have been toned done. There's still the occasional track, however, with a glimmer of Wisconsin Death Trip in it (Destroy All and Otsegolectric, first instance), but the sound is overall a much softer one. Still industrial, but not quite as heavy as it once was."
4,Finding a sound that works,"I was much more impressed with this album than i was with their previous two efforts. The vocals are crisper, the songs have a cleaner sound to them, and tripp eisen just kicks @$$ on the guitar. It still doesn't posess that addictive quality that some of the other releases in this genre have attained. I can only listen to it for so long before i go back to something else. Still, if you're just getting into the band, this album is definitely the one for you."
3,""" I don't think static x was in the zone with this cd""","This cd wasn't as bad as most people made it out to be. It wasn't anything great, and it had many flaws, but it was better than ""beneath, between, beyond"". The main flaws in this cd is that static x was trying a new style for their music. Songs like ""new pain"", ""the only"", and even ""shadow zone"" were proof that the new style would never work. However, the cd did have some good classic Static X sounding songs on it. ""control it"", ""kill your idols"", and ""monster"" were more like songs you would expect from static x. So I really don't see why everyone gave such poor reviews, because about half of the cd still sounding like classic static x. This album is good to add to your static x collection, plus the different sound might attract new fans that may not have liked the hardcore static x sound."
5,"""Evil Disco"" at it's best!","HAHA, what a ridiculous label, ""Evil Disco"" Well, they came up with it themselves, I didn't... Anyway, this one kicks ass, much better than ""Machine"" and slightly better than ""Wisconsin Death Trip"" The riffs are much cooler on this one, and the guitar sound is way heavier than the other two. Chalk that one up to their new guitarist, Tripp Eisen, who I believe was in ""Dope"" before Static-X. Wayne's vocals have improved a lot as well, there is way more melody now, and the lyrics are less redundant. That was a problem with the other two releases. I don't know if that matters to most people, seems like people want groove and heaviness, which Static-X have both. They have improved overall, very reccomended."
4,enough whining,"people have been complaining about this album since the week it came out... seems most their arguments are based on ""wayne sings too much""... they're also upset the album is a far strech from wisconsin death trip's sound, which is mostly due to the change in the band's lineup over the years... from an industrial/metal standpoint, this album isnt that bad at all... too many people are whining cause wayne is actually trying to work melody into his music, though it appears that fanbase is composed mostly of retard modern metalheads that listen to slipknot... as to rest of you real static-x fans, i bet your relieved to hear this after machine... shadow zone has a much more complete sound, better lyrics, and feels it has more effort put into it... forget the mainstream... buy what you like, i like this..."
5,"sweet album, can't get enough of it...","Don't judge this band by Machine. IT's their worst album, this album is much better even better than Wisconson death trip. With the exception of Transmission(not even a song), it's catchy and heavy at the same time. Although it's not the heaviest thing out there, I still recommend anyone who has liked anything by Static-x to buy this album. I've owned it for a month now and i still listen to it on a regular basis which is tough because most alums i own have a listen time of 2 weeks top before something new comes out that i like."
2,"THIS BAND HAS COMPLETELY SOLD OUT, THEY NOW SUCK","SHADOW ZONE- What the hell happened to STATIC X? When WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP came out it was awesome. The songs were heavy and the beats were tight and all was great in the world. Then MACHINE came out and I started to see a change in their musical direction, in other words they were trying to go ""mainstream"". Now on SHADOW ZONE they have completely sold their souls to try to get on mainstream radio. If you listen to WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP then this album you would never have guessed the same band produced those albums.This album is watered down radio friendly cheese and must be avoided like the plague."
1,absolutely atrocious release...,"As a big fan of Static-X (and all metal in general), I cannot believe they've released this pile of crap. I've heard garage bands do better.Wisconsin Death Trip was a masterpiece (i've listened to that thousands of times), Machine was fair (i'd give that about a 4 or 5 out of 10), and now this....I was worried when i had heard ""the only"". That has to be the worst 'rock' song that i've ever heard. I figured the CD would have to at least have some good songs on it. Not the case...No hooks, no good melodies, nothing kicks ass, and the patented Wayne ""growl"" is about gone.As for other reviews saying this is great.....trust me, it's not.This release goes down in the books as the worst rock, metal, or alternative CD easily in the last 5 years.Awful, just atrocious....i can't stress this enough. If i could give it a ""0"" or a minus rating, i would."
2,Static-X? Nah.. can't be,"Oh man, when I heard that Static-x put out a new cd, I instantly went out and bought on the spot, because WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP and MACHINE were great albums (more so death trip), I mean, those two cd a amazing! so I popped this baby in my cd player! and pushed play! and..! and.. and was horrible dissapointed. this whole cd sounds entirely the same. The only stand out song at all is ""Destroy all"", the rest sounds like ""messy metal"" where all it is, is DISTORTION DISTORTION DISTORTION, much like slipknots horrible ""Iowa"". I call it 'messy metal' because thats what it is! a big mess if heavy metal. Save your money. Dont buy this. I was so apauled by this, i threw it out in my apartment parking lot, and ran it over, numerous times with my car, listening to a VERY satisfying CRUNCH, along with Slipknots 'Iowa'. 2 stars, one for Destroy All, and two for my respect for Static-x's previous material."
1,Dont waste your money,"Being a fan of Static X since ""Wisconsin"" this album was a huge disappointment. On the first track I thought Jonathan Davis was guest vocalling. The Ballad is so ... I found myself wondering if I was listening to a Yanni album or something. This is Static X's lame attempt to sell out. Some songs sound like Korn... some like Disturbed.. But they all lack the originality that the first two albums had. Static X used to have something. Like when you heard Godflesh... or Fear Factory for the first time. You knew you had something creative and ass kicking at the same time. Static X started off like that, but crashed and burned like an Iraqi Scud. But If you like ... vocals, you'll love the Shadow Zone"
3,eh what happend here?,yet another cd i got yesterday and i was alittle worried cause i had heard three songs off of it on their website and they were'nt anything like their old stuff and honestly there was every reason to be worried this is just um wow! i mean they lost the whole industrial sound for the most part it seems like they were really quick to make this album and not put any thought into the songs because they are way too repetitive especially the first track god it's awful and the songs don't get good until around the end of the cd this is such a dissapointment because the previous two albums were so good and they always seem to lose a member with each one i dunno if they even come out with another cd you might as well start callin them disturbed-x
4,Pretty Damned Good.,"This is probably my least favorite of Static-X's albums. But, it's still really pretty damned good. It features a lot more singing done by lead singer Wayne Static instead of him doing his usual screaming and growling vocals that he has been doing much more of as of late. I'd really like to hear Wayne do more singing in future projects. Who knows, maybe he will on his upcoming solo project, Pighammer? Anyway, I digress. The best tracks on this album are Destroy All, Control It, Shadow Zone, Kill Your Idols, and Otsegolectric. It seems that with this kind of music, you either love it or hate it. I happen to love Static-X so it's a winner in my book."
3,Uneven...but passable,"First Static-X album to incorporate melody, however, it's not 100%. Half of this album could have fit in nicely with ""Machine"" but that wasn't the case with the gents in the band. Basically, SZ is half screaming (Monster, Destroy All, Otsegolectric) half melodic songs (All in Wait, So, Invincible) with Wayne's singing voice bearing an eerie similarity to Jonathan Davis of Korn fame. Shadow Zone is unfortunately lacking Static-X's characteristic evil disco (which I love), but some electronica/dance elements are present, notably on ""Transmission"" and ""All in Wait.""Last album to feature Tripp Eisen on guitars and first for drummer Nick Oshiro, though that position during recording was filled by expert session musician Josh Freese."
3,"not the old Static-X, Kind of disapointing","Ok so when I first bought this album I was expecting something similar to Machine or Wisconson...but this is far from it. The first few songs where good but then when it got to ""shadow Zone"" thigns went down hill. Then when ""The Only"" came on I thought thats an ok song but thats not Static-X. ""kill your Idols"" is a really good song, reminds me of something of Machine. After that the songs were ok. Then I heard ""so"", I almsot fainted. A ballad!!!What??It's not bad but it's not Static-X!What happened to Wayne's growls? It seems sadly those days are gone. Now all we have left is a processed, conformed version of the once great Static-X. I think this album was very disapointing. I dont know what happened to Static-X? Dare I say sell-out? Maybe, I hope not......."
5,Hit and miss,"Static X comes as a band who's releases hit and miss, Wisconson Death trip was a definate hit, Machine felt more like a miss, Shadow Zone then in turn, is a definate Hit, It is the cd you want to drive and crank it up too.Im a hard rock/metal fan, and this cd is awesome."
2,static-x is losein its touch,this cd wasent that great.it was really short only 39mins long. the songs were pretty good but short they had a relatively short intro and no outro. the lyrics aint bad some of em u can read teh the lyrics and still not know wut static is saying.all n all i thought the cd was lackin wut static-x usually has but thats jsut my opinion
3,Quite a disapointment,"I started listening to Static-X when I bought their 2nd cd, Machine a few years back. I was amazed and very happy with my purchase... so happy I also purchased their first cd Wisconsin Death Trip. These two cds really enhanced my cd collection, and I couldn't wait for Shadow Zone. Yet, I got wind that Ken Jay, Static-X's drmmer, left the band! This really hurt my expectations... because his beats were the backbone of Machine. Anyway, the day comes and Shadow Zone is released, and to no surprise, it did not mesure up to their other two cds. I suggest, if you're just getting into Static-X, purchase WDT or Machine first, than maybe get Shadow Zone. If you're a long time listener (I'm sure you already have it but...) its still Static-X. Its still better than most $hit out there."
4,Static-X's weakest effort,"This cd starts off with anther great opening song, Destory All. Then it has its moments but never really takes off. Guitarist Tripp doesnt add much and im glad he was let go. Still a good effort but Start a war is 100% better."
3,Pleasingly banal,"Although widely divergant from Wisconsin Death Trip in execution of style, vocals, and overall sound, Shadow Zone is by no means a novelty in the banal sea of modern music. Far more influenced by the farrago of the currently in vogue ""nu-metal"", than in their other albums, the lead singer of Static-X eschews his original predeliction for Ministry and Prong, for an updated imitation of Jonathan Davis and Layne Stayley. Shadow Zone may be just another supererogatory conglomeration of all the best elements of far superior bands that paved these ear pummeling roads long before Static X was even conceived of in the mediocre minds of its musicians, however, it is pleasingly nostalgic in its banality."
2,?????HUH!,ok wat happend koichi left and static-x just became a little spark i dont get it...this is not good not good at all i am dissapointed.......half this c.d is pop rock .....but there is sum hope...i mean i was able to find 3 goos songs on this album 1.Destroy All 2.Kill Your Idols 3.Ostegolectric(one of the best ostegos)
5,"Excellent, A Rock Band that knows More than 3 Chords","Excellent, Musical and brutal at the same time. Ignore the previous reviews. The band is in fine form. There is no absence of techno effects, they just are better integrated creating an impressive over all sound. Wayne is at no loss for painful screaming, but the alternation between that and his singing is refreshing. The band is threatening, powerful and downright scary. The way i've always loved them."
4,YES,"I'm so glad that I got this CD for Christmas. I think the band is even better now that they have Tripp. This CD is excellent. I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews and complaints, but ignore that..buy this now!!P.S. If you ever have a chance to see them live, do it..they are really, really good..REALLY good."
2,blah,"static-x WERE good... their machine cd was excellant, but what happend? this cd is softter than machine, as 'heavy' as wiscon death trip, and more horrible than either. i suggest that you borrow it from a friend before you waste your money on it."
5,out of the shadows,"I have to disagree with the bulk of the other reviews out here.. for me each successive static x cd has proved to be better than the last. I wasn't overly impressed by 'Wisconsin' it has some great tracks on it.. but it gets a bit samey after a while.. 'Machine' on the other hand truly rocks.. I put off buying it for a while, but as soon as i heard 'black and white' I was off to get a copy... and I was'nt disappointed! 'Shadow zone' isn't released in the UK until the 20th of October.. 2 weeks late.. but I have heard loads from the record and I am eagerly awaitng my copy. For those of you who have complained about the change in sound its called PROGRESSION people.. its how bands evolve and grow.. and it looks like the 'X' are definately going in the right direction!they've also defined a stronger image for themselves as time has gone on.. something else that will benefit them in this age of blandness!Keep it up guys!"
3,"Ok, but not interesting for them","It is a good product, that sometimes my daughter likes to hold and get some sounds from. that's pretty much it.It depends mainly on vocal/sound effects rather than using tye big screen to associate with letter/number shapes.I'd say it is good for a brief period, but doesn't attract as it should be. There are better out there."
4,Great for ages 4-18 months,"I bought it for my grandchild (age 4 months), she loves to hear the phone ring and talk to her."
2,Sound is too low,"I bought this for my daughter today. She was playing with it in the store and it was loud and you could hear the numbers, voices, and ringing clearly. But as soon as we took it out of the box and removed the strip from the back the volume was inaudible. I cannot even hear it unless we are in a very quiet room which is rare when you have two children. I am taking this back to the store tomorrow. It is a shame because other than the volume it is an amazing toy!"
2,"Fun for kids, TORTURE for parents","Thank goodness we do not own this one! The one-year-old I was babysitting brought it over, and all three kids (oldest not quite 3) loved it. I could handle it, mostly, myself, until they discovered the button that sings some random customized words to the melody of ""This Old Man,"" *OFF KEY!!!* Let me say that once more: the song is played in one key in standard electronic-toy tones. The voice sings the song in an Entirely Different Key. It's not just one or two notes that are a little off, it's the Whole Song - by at least a full step.As another friend of mine put it, this is the stuff of horror movies."
2,Do Not buy this phone if you are musically inclined,"This is a cute phone, though the voice is slightly obnoxious. The thing that really bothers me is that when you press the moon/pound button, it plays the tune of ""This Old Man"" in one key (E-flat) while the voice sings it in ANOTHER KEY (B). It's atrocious. And this WILL be your child's favorite button to press, because kids love music, no matter how awful it is."
1,What the heck?,"Not only did this phone not work, but the screen was really quite tiring on my eyes. The only ringtone that it had was a sound like beads being shaken up. The flashing light was distracting, and its features were extraordinarily limited! The camera option didn't work at all, and where the heck was the texting??? My parents bought this phone for me for my birthday, and it really made me mad!! I can see that this might be a good starter phone, but you can only get 0 calls froim it, and really limited reception in the mountains. Switch to a Razr as soon as possible."
1,very low volume...still trying to get customer support,the phone has a very low volume. i don't know if its meant to be that way but i am trying to get some customer support. no reply as yet though
4,Nice enough phone,"We got this for our 1-year-old daughter who is obsessed with telephones. She likes it, but it doesn't mean she's not still obsessed with the real phone that mom and dad hold up to their heads when they talk sometimes. Also, the way this phone lights up reminds us of the episode of The Simpsons where the family goes to Japan and gets seizures watching television."
1,Not enough volume!!!,"For you to be able to hear this phone at all, you'd need to turn everything off, even your fan. Even so, the telephone is still not loud enough to cause attention. When we got this phone I was hoping it would replace an old Vtech phone my older children used to own 12 years ago (when my children outgrew it, it was donated to charity). That thing was not only loud enough, it had at least 16 different tunes (YES 16), it would ring, say the alphabet, you name it; anyway much better than this piece of junk. This one is way overpriced by the way. Vtech downgraded their original phone, took four dollars off the price and lowered the volume. Then they decided to share the original available features among a bunch of other devices including their overpriced children laptops with no backlight. None of then are worth the price, Vtech used to make such great toys years ago.PS I tried slipping a plastic piece like instructed, to no avail, it didn't work for me."
4,Great phone to save your phone...just don't pull the paper out!!,Great phone for my little since she loves to reach for mine when I am on it or for one of the remotes. I too had the same trouble. My daughter loved the phone in the store in the box. As soon as I took it out of the box and took the little white piece out the phone immediately was a dud. She looked at it then put it down. To save the day I opened the batter cover...put a little piece of paper in the slot and magic as a review suggested. She can hear it and it keeps her entertained. Good buy that can be taken along. V-tech definitely needs to correct that error or put two volume levels.
1,Can't hear this phone!,"The volume of this phone is way too low my kids can only hear it when it is up to their ear! While the lights and color buttons are attractive the fact that they can not hear the sounds makes this phone boring quick, plus, it just really cannot complete with our super high-tech and uber alluring Iphones which the kids are always trying to get their hands on to our dismay.... this is just not a good enough distraction/substitute I am afraid."
4,Easy to use,"My daughter loves this toy!! She is 9 months old, so I don't know the educational value of it yet. She loves the flashing colors, and it is easy for her to push the buttons. Her grandparents don't live nearby, so she learns to hear grandma and grandpa as names of people. It has Spanish/French hello and good-bye. She can crawl and push it around with her. Easy to handle and she loves to chew on the small ""antenna""."
2,Nice toy but not durable,I purchased this toy for my grand son. He played with it for short amounts of time for about one month before the button that moves the screens for the three different mode stopped working. It is now stuck on the numbers mode witch is the best of the three. I do not think this button was pushed more then ten to fifteen times before it stopped working.
3,"FUN, BUT BROKE ON US!!!",THIS WOULD BE A GREAT PHONE IF THE QUALITY WAS BETTER. MY HUSBAND AND I HAD TO RECONSTRUCT THE PHONE AFTER IT BROKE THE SECOND DAY OF HAVING IT!!!
1,Phone Volume Stopped Working,"Like the previous reviewer, our phone had a nice volume when we first purchased it. There's a plastic tab on the back of it that says pull to remove once you purchase. As soon as we removed that tab the volume dropped so low that you're almost unable to hear anything. We replaced the batteries but nothing has helped. My son likes the lights but loses interest quickly now that he can't hear the noise from the toy. I can't find it in store anywhere and it was a gift so I can't return it without a receipt."
1,terrible volume waste of money!,"my daughter got this toy for Christmas. Inside the packaging the toy was really loud and she enjoyed it, once I removed it from the packaging and pulled the tab on the back the volume went so low you have to put it up against your ear to hear it. I changed the batteries and it still isn't loud, now she won't even take a second look at the toy she cares nothing for it anymore. it was a total waste of money!"
2,One-year-old daughter likes it fine . . .,"and it keeps her busy in her car seat, but it drives me nuts! When all the different colored lights are flashing and it is ringing and talking at the same time, it is way over the top. Although it advertises itself as a ""teaching"" toy, I don't see how my daughter could possible learn anything while being bombarded by so many different sights and sounds. I recommend the Fisher Price friendly flip phone instead -- much cuter and not nearly so annoying. (Full disclosure - as a rule I generally don't like electronic toys, and this is one of the few electronic toys my daughter owns.)"
1,Pig in a poke,"This is a facsimile of the book ""The History of Initiation, in twelve lectures; comprising a detailed account of the rites and ceremonies, doctrines and discipline of all the secret and mysterious institutions of the ancient world"" by Rev. George Oliver, D.D., published by Richard Spencer, London, in 1841. This work is not in copyright."
3,Treading lightly on Le Corbusier,"It is nice to see that Le Corbusier is ""cool"" again. However, this is probably one of the ""thinnest"" books on the master architect, who probably did more than any other architect to define Modernism. For those who want more in the way of narrative I would suggest Peter Frampton's or William Curtis' monographs on Le Corbusier, which provide ample illustrations and a more in-depth analysis of his work. Better yet, check out his Complete Works, which will give you valuable insights into this great architect."
5,A great symphony from a great interpreter.,"When I was attending the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, I would often drive down 95 to hear the National Symphony play. Slava was music director then, and he often got uneven results from his band. The Russian/Soviet repertory, however, was the one area in which both Slava and his orchestra consistantly excelled. The pathos of this music is brought out in vivid, slashing colors. The brasses snarl, the strings are supple and strong, the winds pungeant and evocative of tone. This is perhaps, along with the No. 7 ""Leningrad"" his definitive wartime symphony. It's a great ride with this master of the Russian repertoire and his orchestra."
5,great for group study,"I am using this book to lead a study of the ten commandments with a group of mostly Presbyterian women, and all, without exception, love this book and find it profound and moving. We had one of our best discussions ever just yesterday; every woman in the group was able to relate to Sister Joan's words. Sister, you have our gratitude, given in the hope that you will continue to write of the spiritual life in so meaningful a way."
5,The 10 Commandments,The individuals who harp to have the 10 Commandments put in public spaces should read this very comprehensive historical text from Moses to present day application.
5,Ten Commandments,"""The Ten Commandments, Laws of the Heart"" by Sister Joan Chittister is an excellent book. In it she brings the Laws of Moses into the 21st century and gives the reader a new viewpoint of how they apply to our modern world and the way we live. It's a very easy read but each chapter or Commandment interpretation will force the reader to put the book down after reading the chapter and contemplate on it. It's not just another book on the Ten Commandments but a spiritual experience."
2,Sociopolitical Marxism,"Well now, I know where some of the true Marxist are hiding. In this book, Nieto is trying to create equity policies in schools using taxpayer dollars. If she had her way, she would get rid of capitalism, social classes, and distribution of wealth. Of course, we have already seen how that works in the former Soviet Union (it doesn't work at all). Yes, in a democratic-republic (Nieto always forgets the republic part) there is a dominant culture. Kind of why we call this a nation state, we have national culture. Unfortunately, Nieto is too busy saying the dominant culture is based on White European ideals. In fact, the ideals are based on Judaism, which is not European at all.There are some aspects of diverse cultures that keep people down trodden in our society, and it is NOT restricted to the dominant cultures. But Nieto makes it sound as though it only happens to dominant cultures."
2,18 rock classics,"I figured I would listen to this cd... it wasn't that good at all. If you ask me, they are almost all low budget artists that cant sing. Although if you like old rock, you may actually like it."
5,great journey,A very well detailed story about An adventure that took place more than 70 years ago. A lot of the characters in the story are from my home area.
5,History made exciting,"This is the story of an incredible and unlikely true adventure of a young cowboy riding on a bet from Oklahoma to Hollywood. I'm not much for history books, but Dickinson makes the story exciting and come alive by her excellent writing style. From the beginning you want to know what the outcome will be, so you can't help but read on."
4,Review of Washington Avalanche 1910,"I selected the novel because I'm a hopeless romantic with completely idealistic thoughts and expectations of love and relationships. The novel definitely fit the reader in this case. If you're not a romantic don't read the book, but if you are, it's a tear jerker and heart flitter. I was taken with the character of Ginny. Ginny escapes her stepbrother who is trying to take her inheritance by marrying her off to a scoundrel. On the train, Ginny meets Virginia who is also escaping her abusive father in a sense. She is part of an arranged marriage to Nicholas Bennett. Since Virginia's father is abusive, and her father arranged the marriage Virginia asks Ginny to switch identities with her so that she can check Nicholas out before marrying him (She assumes that Nicholas must also be like her father.). Nicholas checks out to be a great find for Virginia, but Ginny and Nicholas fall in love before the switch is revealed."
2,Not as good...,"I love alot of the books by Cameron Dokey, but frankly, this one was a disapointment. I love her style of writing and this book was very informative and had some really fun parts. But I was surprised and sad to see how morals were twisted and made to seem acceptable. This bothered me immensly and I didn't like the end at all. It didn't leave a feeling of satisfaction when I finished it and I was even a little angry. I felt that the book lacked consequences to the immoral behavior. I didn't fall in love with the hero, as I usually do in books, and the herorine didn't impress me. She isn't a role model I would choose for myself. This was an interesting read and I learned more about this tragic event in history, but I probably wouldn't give it to my child to read someday. If this review gave too much of the story away, I apologize. But I felt that I should warn someone in case they feel as I do."
5,"A terrific series that is a ""must read""!","I have enjoyed all of the books in this series so far. Washington Avalanche, 1910 is no exception. Two girls, both named Virginia, meet be chance on an ill-fated train ride through Washington state. Neither of them realize that the outcome of their meeting, and the results of a plan they hatch to disguise their real reasons for this train trip, will change their lives forever. This book is full of romance, history and sadness (this was a horrific accident in American history), but I found it enjoyable and a good read."
4,Must Read,"This is a spectacular book about two women who meet on a train. One of these ladies is running away from her uncle, and the other is going to meet her fiancé in Washington. She's never met him eye to eye. These two ladies names are Virginia and Jenny.Virginia and Jenny decide to switch places. This is because Virginia's uncle wants to kill her. Jenny's getting could feet so she's not sure if she wants to marry her fiancé. The catch is nether of the men no what they look like. When Virginia meets the fiancé they fall in love instantly. There's still a bigger problem one that can tear their love apart. It happens when they meet on the train again with the uncle. You should read this book because it's very thrilling and exciting."
2,"Difficult at times, better the second time around.","Richard's deals with people on the outside of our experience, drunkards, murderers, unorthodox policemen, circus people. While his style is not stream of consciousness he often seems to hover on the edge of it. The long sentences (one of which is two pages long!) can sometimes make following the story difficult, but rich and original imagery balances this. The book is better the second time around for sure. My favorite story was Gentleman's Agreement, the first in the collection. Very touching, a story about fatherly love."
3,Form over Function,"This is the cutest little furgle iPod nano case EVER. But that's where it ends. The zippered pouch for headphone storage is only just large enough to fit a set of buds jammed and crammed in. The openings for access to the headphone jack and hold buttons are not located in the right spots. Overall, it's a bit awkward to use, but the fact remains that it's the cutest case out there."
4,The Whole Truth,"Living in BC at the time that this story takes place, I can recall the events through the eyes of the news. Michael Eastham tells the real story of the Johnson and Beltley murders and the resultant investigation in all their grisly details. I did find Eastham's writing style to be somewhat lacking in grace but the story that he has to tell more than makes up for it."
3,Not telling the whole story,I have written a review and I am wondering where it has gone too. Can you please e-mail me and let me know what has happened?
3,Old technology - will soon be useless.,"The only reason I bought these glasses was for experimentation and use of the vga dongle to make my Acer H5360 work with iZ3D stereo drivers (via iZ3D's interlaced output and the dongle's interlaced mode). Once ATI turns on quad buffering in the Catalyst drivers, these glasses and the vga dongle will become useless to me, as they cannot sync correctly with any of the modern LCD panels I have tried them on."
3,Not a toy,"Well this ""toy"" didn't have the desired effect from my 5 year old dino lover. The dinosaur is molded to the skeletal image so he doesn't really stand upright which makes it hard to play with. But I think it's really neat and hope that in time my son will mature enough to appreciate it unless he losses his dinosaur appetite."
2,Not too happy with this product - sorry,"I don't want to return this item; however, I was a little disappointed - the quality of the chain wasn't the best in my opinion. The chain was a little too large and not what I expected (even though it was supposedly copper or copper coated). The Irish penny was very lightweight. I think the item would have looked so much better on a nice silver chain ... a little more streamlined. I'm sorry to say, that I'm not happy with this product; however, it was given as a gift so I won't be returning it."
5,Progressive Hard Rock,"If you like Deep Purple but don't own Fireball, you are in for a real treat. This album is a hard rock masterpiece and Ian Gillan would totally agree with me. It's a shame that Fireball has been kind of forgotten about, it clearly holds up against In Rock. If you're just starting to collect their albums, maybe you already have Machine Head, this one won't disappoint you. It is one of the great rock albums of the seventies.The highlights: Fireball, Strange Kind of Woman, Anyone's Daughter, Fools, No One Came, Demon's Eye, I'm Alone and Freedom.PS: Check out their 2005 album, Rapture of the Deep. It holds up well. I would say it is right up there with their classic material."
4,Strong From Beginning to End,Truly a breakthrough recoring for the Mark 2 Deep Purple. And it is even better with the bonus tracks. Solid opening with the one two punch of Fireball and No No No. Great solos and vocals on these two puppies. Demons Eye is pretty good but a litle plain. I like the Purp's attempt at country with Anyone's Daughter. Cool lyrics and different vocal style. The Mule kicks but not one of the better tracks with not enough vocals. Fools rules and No One Came is ultra cool with amusing lyrics.Happy Strange Kind of Woman made this one as it's a catchy tune with more oomph to it than the somewhat plain Demon's Eye. The rest of the tracks are ok and sometimes fun. I do not hear the difference between the 2006 No One Came and the original. Like the take on the William Tell Overture. The backwards piano is unnecessary.
2,shop around,"good trailer but very over priced, several parts were missing, the tilt is very hard to control, also with the double wheels it is almost impossible to back"
2,Disappointing,"This book is very poorly organized, the ""French dictionary"" contained no useful phrases, and the maps were terrible!! I would definitely choose something more comprehensive & buy a separate city map."
4,Helpful Guide,"This guide proved to be very helpful, informative and insightful for my recent 9 day trip. Nicely organized and up to date material."
4,Very good,This guide was invaluable during my recent trip to Montreal- the maps were great- having the reviewed places marked on the maps made life a lot easier. I just wish it were bigger.
3,Too much to be very useful.,"I think I've finally realized that I don't really like lonely planet guides. They try to be something for everyone and while there are some clues to what you're getting yourself into, a guide that includes both places for raves and early bird dinners, just has too much for me. It did provide one good tip for live music, but I probably could have gotten that easily some other way (online, asking locals, etc). I recommend Frommers 3-day guide and Eat.Shop.Montreal for a visit. It does have good maps, though, and it's very thorough. It also has a nice consice history of montreal and culture description that did enrich my visit, but again, you could get that from wikipeida if you took the time."
5,Wonderful romance about Canadian rock climbers.,"I really loved this book. Julie loves rock climbing but thinks that she'd have to give it up and become a ""normal"" wife if she ever married. So, she's prepared to be an old maid until she meets David. Eventually, David shows her that she can serve God even while pursuing her love of the outdoors."
5,Our New Cat Loves It!,"This was the perfect solution for our cat. We had plenty of room for his litter box, floor bed, two sets of stacked tables for him to climb upon for exercise, and a lounge area at the top! He loves it! We love it! He's protected at night and from getting into fights at certain times of the day. Best of all is the door so we can enter to feed him, service the litter box, and love him when he is not allowed out. When he is tired and finished running around the yard and up the trees he marches back into his kennel for a snack and snooze.The frame went together easily enough, but the chain link didn't unroll all that well so the whole project took some 4 hours. The ""hooks"" could use some redesigning. In the end it was well worth the effort. Allow time and be patient!"
5,Poems from Homeroom: A Writer's Place to Start,"I love this book! Kathi Appelt presents some of her own poetry with the inspirations behind each poem and suggestions for students trying to write their own. There are many good writing prompts, and she explores different styles of poetry. I found this to be a very useful resource as a middle school ELA teacher."
5,Best Gift!,"My very thoughtful sister-in-law, after finding out that I was pregnant (this is our first), sent me this book. It is a wonderful journal that is Scripturally based, which I like a lot. Each trimester has it's own overview, each week it's own devotional, and you get a few lines to fill in each day what you were feeling, etc. Highly recommended for anyone who would like something personally meaningful to hand down to their child."
3,False advertising,"I would not have believed that Amazon would accept such dirty tricks. The book ""Return from Witch Mountain"" was not written by Alexander Key as advertised. It is based on the Disney movie and characters created by Alexander Key. I was hoping for an original story, not for the retelling of a movie which was not that good to start with. But I was hoping that the book would be better that the film. I would not recommend this book to anyone.That it was also in deplorable condition, far from being ""acceptable"" is another point. in the future I will know that what I consider acceptable is not the same as Amazon's term, and I will refrain from buying items that are labeled as such."
2,Interesting Book,"I can't say I really enjoyed this book, it was interesting because of the honesty of the author. He didn't deny the corruption of the police and other officials in Mexico; however I found the stories themselves rather boring."
3,Not inspired writing,"Since this book is full of history I enjoyed it but it is not inspired writing. Sometimes it seemed plodding. Much of the account of World War II consisted in a continuing catalog of German atrocities and losses in air raids. I cannot say Gilbert has a good sense of proportion. Some insignificant things get mentioned (McDonald's gets a sentence) and important things are omitted (U.S. politics is the subject of the merest nods). Even the birth of Israel is directly mentioned only in telling that the U.S. recognized it minutes after it was proclaimed. I was glad to finish this book, and I am not sure it'll be worth while to read Volume III. There is a bibliography (heavy on books published in England) but no footnotes or source notes."
3,Not Bad,"If you're wondering why this DVD is bargain-priced, one viewing will provide the answer. Both picture and sound quality are less than sterling; however, this set is still a good bargain. The viewer is treated to a glimpse of the young Dwight performing some songs which cannot be found elsewhere and, despite the picture and sound flaws, nonetheless offers an entertaining glimpse of Dwight in the early years. Dedicated fans of Dwight will enjoy this one; however, for those who want a better DVD (also at a good price), the ""Austin City Limits"" DVD is a longer and better set, without the technical flaws. I leave the decision to each viewer's individual discretion; I simply bought both, and am glad that I did so."
3,Thinkin' about picking this up? Here's the details...,"If you're a Dwight fan there's no reason you won't want this in your collection. It's Dwight and his band playing inside a small venue in England at the Peterborough Country Music Festival on August 23, 1986. The program lasts 25 minutes and has the following songs:COME BACK TO ME (although this is probably titled incorrectly - it's better known as ""Can't You Hear Me Calling"")1,000 MILESROCKY ROAD BLUESIT WON'T HURTHONKY TONK MANWALKIN' AFTER MIDNIGHTTHIS DRINKIN' WILL KILL MEIt's a budget disc so don't buy this expecting great picture quality, which ranks no better than a VHS dub, and the audio won't blow you away either. What's important is that is Dwight Yoakam and if you love everything he does - LIKE ME - then you will definitely want to buy this."
5,Quite Dwight,"This is as the amazonians wrote a little rough in the video images but a must for a true Dwight fans like my mom. He doesn't tour enough so this is the only thing she can get from him live, pardon the expression ma..."
2,"Historical, or historically biased?","I agree this book is definitely one sided and skewed. Mussolini was not a saint, however this book fails to mention any other aspect of his life, other than that of disturbed Hitler sidekick. The fact remains that Benito Mussolini was a leader in his own right. Many other biographies show his ability to make people have pride, and the 'mighty' Adolph Hitler twitch. look elsewhere for facts."
4,Much Better Than Expected,"I anticipated something different and got it. Nice variations on Nirvana standards and stuff that commercial radio would never touch. It makes it sadder that Cobain is gone. In retrospect, he was a real innovator and created a lot of the genre, which shows through in this set."
5,NIRVANA DEFINED AN ERA - YOURS!,"Nirvana is essential. If you haven't heard them in your lifetime, you are an idiot. Please redeem your stupidity and pick up a Nirvana album. You may see the light beyond no-substance top40s of the blink-182 kind. =>"
2,Only for the obsessed,"Don't get me wrong; I love Nirvana. I also love box sets with lots of B-sides, live cuts and rarities. However, this one is scraping the bottom of the barrel. There's a reason tracks are called ""rehearsals"" or ""demos"". Often, some demos are diamonds in the rough. Unfortunately, this box set has only a handful, and for the total amount of material, it's just not worth it. Most of this should have been left on the cutting room floor."
2,A best of cd/dvd with it would have been nice.,"2.5 stars in my opinionWhen I hear box set I think a collection of best of songs, covers, demos, a collection of videos, and rare songs all rolled up into one set so you don't have to go out and get every single cd or search for the holy grail of demos. Paying $50 for this monstrosity then paying $20 just so I can get a best of cd is insane. I was hoping that if I got this set I wouldn't have to lug my [...] to the music stores and buy their entire catalog. This is as horrible as Slayer's box set from last year. I was expecting maybe to hear some covers of bands that from Dave Grohl's mouth Kurt and him were into (i.e. Celtic Frost) on this collection. This must have been a Courtney Love controlled release. Ah our generation's Yoko Ono. I'll wait 10 more years for another box set to be released."
4,Okay if your a real intense fan,"Yah just have to love the boys to take this thing on. I mean this is definately a rough cut, unplugged, nirvanam. towne"
3,Cool...But Not Great,"Most of these tracks are either demo versions or live recordings. Its overall musical appeal is marginal, nothing better than Nirvana's other albums, but has a few songs that you've probably never heard and this 4-disc collection is a ""must-have"" for the obsessed fan. Contains one DVD CD, with live footage from shows. I was pleased to hear some of the unreleased songs are finally out in public, my only regret is Courtney Love will probably receive a significant amount of funds from this release."
2,they were aight,"I mean Nirvana had a catchy Cut with ""Smells like teen Spriti"" but there real claim to Fame was knocking Michael Jackson's ""Dangerous"" from the Number 1 spot. I think Cobain was a Decent Writer,but on a whole this Band was a dime a dozen to me. what did they do that the Pixies&other bands didn't? the only thing they did that I truly dug was there Unplugged set,but this is way too much for a Act that I consider of the Moment back in 1991."
3,Not as good as I expected,I heard a lot of these versions on the Nirvana Unplugged album. They were done better on that album. The other pieces had a little too much noise in them for my taste.
1,Someone is searching for a quick buck!,"this is a case of not judging a book by its cover. on the outside the case is cool looking sleek, inside however the contents of the discs are poor and boring. unless you like here bad recordings of half writen drug induced songs this box set is must don't buy. the box set begins with a version of heartbreaker in which you can't even here vocals and the guitar playing is only medicore! unless you are a true nirvana freak this box set is not for the so so fan but for a seasoned nirvana freak. if you buy the box set realize you are buying ofr the mere fact of owning it not listening to it, that is unless you are in coma."
5,BEST BOX SET HANDS DOWN!!!!,"THIS BOX SET IS JUST KILLER. I LOVE ALL THE SONGS, AND THEY LET YOU SEE THE BAND'S TALENT AND HOW MUCH THEY PROGRESSED. IT JUST MAKES ME SICK THAT AMAZON SAYS THIS ALBUM GOES BETTER WITH A FREAKING U2 CD. U2 SUCKS!!! ALSO THAT CUSTOMERS WHO BOUGHT THIS BOUGHT ALBUMS BY PEARL JAM AND GREEN DAY. BUT BACK TO THE REVIEW. EVERY SONG ON HERE IS GREAT. THE DVD IS ALSO GREAT. BUT I THINK THAT WHEN THEY COMPILED THEY LEFT OUT A FEW RARE SONGS MANY NIVANA FANS WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. ALL AROUND A GOOD BUY THOUGH."
5,The Best of The Best.,This boxed set may sound kind of fuzzy but it is because most of them are kick ass demos and unreleased tracks. If you are addicted to Nirvana like me by this. Only buy it if you already like Nirvana. If you don't know who they are you are now into rock. If you havent heard them buy Nevermind. The DVD has some footage of them playing there songs.
2,Smells Like for Hard Core Fans Only,"I really tried to like this box set, but it wasn't to be. When Koban and crew were in their grove they were wonderful, but this set has too many demos that sound like they were recorded using bargan basement cassette tapes. There's also a couple tracks of the band jamming to nothing particular while Koban wails for 9 minutes. Alas, there are a couple jems on here, but not emough to fill up even one of the three CD's. If you want good Nirvana stick to something like the new ""Nevermind"" remaster."
3,some insight,"I don't own this box set, but at one time I had all of these songs downloaded, and they were (for the most part) crap. I hate to say this, as I am a huge Nirvana fan, and not just a fan of the big studio hits. I love the raw, grinding, cacophonous singles, but a lot of these recordings sound like they were recorded with a twenty-dollar recorder, are jumbled and poorly performed, and have no real musical quality. After hearing these songs, I wondered if Kurt Cobain was a genius who worked out his style by experimenting, as we hear in this set or if he was a strung-out heroin addict who managed to write a handful of decent songs and a few great ones, aided by great producers and sound engineers."
1,Correction: The worst boxset of all boxsets,"This is only the boxset of all boxsets if you're a suit at Geffen waiting for all the money to roll in from the unsuspecting customers you've duped. As for us customers, well, there isn't any substance to this poor compilation of previously-vaulted material. And by the way: There IS better material in the vaults. For example, ""Raunchola"" WAS recorded in the studio. There's also an amazing alternate studio version of ""Hairspray Queen"" with Chad Channing on drums. THESE are the types of Nirvana songs you should be paying seventy dollars for. Whoever decided ""Beans"" should've been included on a boxset (or released at all) needs to be fired from his job at McDonald's and replaced with Krist Novoselic."
1,Disapointing,I bought this box set with much hope and excitment I couldn'twait to listen to it. When I did I felt ripped off I was so disapointed. The tracks were so bad they were practicaly unlistenable. You would think they would have remastered them but they did not. The recordings were horrible and distorted. The dvd was the band playing in a hole in what looked a basement and Kurt has his back turned to a wall it was comical if I hadn't paid 40dollars for it. I did enjoy seasons in the sun that was very good.I am a big fan of Nirvana but I did not find this set worthwhile.
3,Not that great,Some of the stuff on this box set is not that great.Here is what i think of itDISC 1 2.5: Kind of lame. some of the demos are pretty dumbDISC 2 3.0: Better then the first. some of the songs are not that goodi finish this later
5,i gotta get this,"nirvana changed the face of music and as a huge nirvana fan, always have been , always will be, i gotta get this. it just came out today and i know im gonna get like 3 copies for xmas (thats why im gonna wait) because all my friends and family know i love nirvana, so i guess ill have to exchange 1 or 2 of them.there are alot of people that cry and moan about how nirvana changed music and dominated hard rock and hair bands.....well, guess what? YOUR AN IDIOT IF YOU THINK THAT!! nirvana will go down as memorable as The Doors, or Led Zepplin.....RIP KURT COBAIN!!"
2,I want to hear the recordings of him & his drug dealer,"This album is horrible, especially coming from the legendary NIRVANA. May Kurt Cobain have his revenge on his former bandmates for this craptastic release. With the Lights Out does no justice for a man such as ""Kurdt"" who took his four-track tape deck out with him while he scored heroin. Us real fans want the f__ked up recordings Kurt Cobain made while he was hanging out with his female drug dealer in a motel after he scored his drug o' choice. And like he'd tell you: It was all for medicinal purposes, man! Yeak f__king right."
1,huh,"I can't rate product. It is a christmas present, but I got usual good fast service & no problems from Amozon!"
2,Buy Another Boxset,"This is mediocre, but I will not diss legends like Nirvana. THe problem I have is that the redundant collection sounds the same.Buy Michael JAckson The Ultimate collection instead."
1,The Holy Grail......,"....of pure crap. Kurt sucked when he was alive and now that's he's a kind of martyr, he's just annoying. This band never should have went anywhere. The music is boring. I've tried to listen to Nirvana so many times over the years. I didn't like it and thought I just didn't ""get it"". Well I'm not the one with the problem. This is just bad music. There's no other way to describe it."
1,Burzum Anyone?? He came out around the same time.,"Burzum, one of the defining black metal artists, came out around the same time as Nirvana.Burzum was original. Burzum was 1 man. Burzum had talent.Nirvana wasn't original, Nirvana was 3 people, Nirvana had no talent.Nirvana= Pixies Rehash.Nirvana= Pearl Jam/Soundgarden WannabesBoth Burzum and Nirvana only lasted several years.Burzum contributed to help music live on, Nirvana destroyed it."
3,For die hard fans only,I would say this is for die hard fans of Nirvana only. I can't see to many other people wanting to spend the money on this.
4,"More something to HAVE, than something to listen to",Reserved only for huge Nirvana fans. Some tracks of very poor quality. Some sound alright. And two or three others I prefer to the studio versions. DVD is crappy late 80's VHS work
3,Good for curiosity,"This is not for the ""Oh, I remember 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' fan."" I received this as a gift and was considering purchasing it before that. The best part is the DVD with old home movie rehearsal footage that offers a great insight to the humble beginiings of this wildly influential band. It's proof they can sound as bad as any other garage band. The CDs are great for showing how songs evolved before they made it to proper studio releases. This set is not something you'll enjoy listening to all the time.....it's almost like it exists for research purposes. Some stuff sounds like absolute garbage, but there are some real highlights especially on Disc 3. I enjoy this box set, but buyer beware. If it's the studio albums you're looking for, you'll be disappointed."
4,"Everything I expected, no surprises like I'd hoped","Per the title, this was everything I expected, but I was really hoping for a few surprises.. I think the most enjoyable part of the whole set was the booklet that came with it, it had a history of Nirvana and I learned a few new things about the band. I pretty much bought it because 1) It was on sale and 2) I got my first car in 10 years that had a CD player in it.I think anyone that actually buys it will think it's well worth it. If it wasn't for the booklet though, I probably would have given it 3 stars. I don't know why I didn't enjoy it more but the music seemed like it was either the same old stuff or something I didn't really care for.Also Dave and the Foo Fighters were on Top Chef the other day :)"
3,Far from essential,"I love Nirvana. Music off this set NEVER (ok, extremely rarely) gets listened to. Buy it if you love Nirvana and are a completist only - else, pretty much everything else. Could be a good gift for someone if they are fully into em and have everything else though."
3,Could've been much better,"There's better stuff out there that could've been released. There are a few tracks on the album that are better quality on bootlegs that I own. How does that happen? In the original ""Oh, the Guilt"", you can hear a lighter being flicked in time with the music. That was one of my favorite parts of the song. On the boxed set, the lighter seems to have been removed. Why was that done? Small things like that and low quality demos make me wish I'd saved me money. On a lighter note, there are 4 or 5 tracks on the box that are keeping me from selling it to a friend.On the whole, if you like Nirvana, but never explored their unreleased and hard-to-find stuff, pick up the box. If you're a die hard who has lots of bootlegs and owns most of the rare stuff, I'd borrow it from a friend to get the few tracks worth owning."
5,Wonderful collection of music,Nirvana is one of my favorite bands. This is a great collections of songs. I really enjoy listening to this album from the first track to the last without skipping any songs.
4,"ROUGH, BUT GOOD...",talk about grunge... the quality on most tracks are horrible like everyone else says.. most of these songs I personally would enjoy more studio recorded.. but there are good tracks for fans..
4,It's all here...except for....,"....the music videos. Why were they not included or released yet. That would have been a nice cherry on top. Also, the first six or so songs on the dvd can get pretty boring, and it sounds like crap (for the most part). Couldn't they find some better live stuff from 92' or ANYTHING from 93'. For half of the dvd, Dave Grohl isn't even playing drums. I can appreciate a few home video clips of them rehearsing early in their career, but this dvd has way to much of that, and it kinda sucks. Although, I will happily say that the cd's are really, really good (as long as yours doesn't have errors on it), and complete the bands discography. I'm not sure if Kurt would have wanted this set released, but I'm happy it was. If anyone knows of a Nirvana music videos DVD, let me know."
1,Sucks.,"Another lame, over-priced, depressing, boring, overrated to hell grunge epic....if this grunge garbage and the other lame grunge garbage bands formed the 90's it's good grunge is dead. This set has nothing worth dropping money for unless you would also buy an album of fart noises with Nirvana written on it....which most cobain die hards would. The guy who said do-re-me is worth the price alone needs to stop buying magic beans."
1,SUCKED BOX SET EVER MADE BY GEFFEN,"It's long long time the fans waiting for this value box set.Geffen Records was made all things for the fans called Sucked Box Set Ever, Ever!! for the Music Legend Established.All 3 CDs was very low remaster recording.especailly DVD ---> it's was the worstest DVD as I ever met."
3,good,"stupid nirvana fansthis boxset is alright thats it, most of the song on it are craper versions of the tracks off nevermind and the 3rd album,it is alright boxset and worth buying and altho this is not a cash grab i feel it has opened the door for thousand of shameless cash ins releases. (considering kurt had 109 home demo tapes and this has what?? nine demo tape songs????)so stop raving about something that is so hyped and over rated."
1,Do not bother reading,All six people in my book club did not like this book. There was no sense of place or story and everybody agreed that that the book was not well written. We felt no connection with the main character and none of us were sure what happened to her at the ending. And what was it with those twins! Don't waste your time reading.
2,Couldn't sustain my interest,"I started this book, but it just didn't sustain my interest. It was recommended online (can't remember by whom), but it didn't do much for me."
1,A failure.,"I am a fan of Amos Oz's novels, but I found ""My Michael"" bleak and unrewarding. Having recently read Oz's memoirs of his childhood, the parallels between the young couple and Oz's own parents are evident. This makes it even stranger to me that Hannah is such an immature personality, which I believe is the reason the novel fails."
5,A classic,"This classic novel by Amos Oz is a good introduction to this brilliant Israeli author. Unlike most translations of foreign books into English, Oz, who speaks fluent English, closely supervises the translation of his work and therefore the English translations of his work beautifully capture the rhythm of his writing in the original Hebrew. Oz is rumored to be a front-runner for the 2009 Nobel Prize in literature, and this book serves as an excellent introduction to his lyrically beautiful work."
4,Many Parallels to His Own Parents Lives,"As others have said in their reviews, there are similarities between the couple in My Michael and the authors own parents. The way the father speaks to his son in both books is very similar (If his highness will do us the favor, etc...), as is the mother's mental/emotional instability. This is not a criticism of Oz; it is not surprising that he based the characters in My Michael largely on his own parents."
5,"I think it is a very good book, and I strongly recomed it.","It starts when David, a young teen-ager escapes from a prison camp. He sneaks aboard a ship bound for Italy, and an Italian sailor givers him some bread and water. He starts of on a big advendure to find his mother in Denmark. He earns money from tourists so he can buy bread. He stays with people for a little while, the he leaves. I think it can have happy parts, and very sad parts. I really enjoed the book."
1,I absolutely did NOT like this book!!!!,"...I did not like it all!...the book is so predictable! By the 3rd to last chapter, I already knew what was going to happen. I do not reccommend this book unless you like books about history."
5,"Worth reading every year, each year.","Though I have read this book countless times through the years, with each reading I discover more of the story and more of myself. I have yet to finish this book and not be in tears, for David, and for the birth, loss, and rebirth of hope itself. I recommend this book to readers of all ages, but particularly those who have struggled through sorrow and rediscovered faith."
5,North to Freedom,"David, a 12 year old, raised in a prison camp, is allowed to escape with instructions to go north to freedom. From the drab, depressing surroundings of the prison camp to the wide world of freedoms, colors, smells, scenery, being clean, and being honest, David cautiously learns about the world around him. This book is a learning adventure at becoming true to one's self. At an early age, this book had a profound effect on my life, David made me stop and appreciate the little things that are such common conveniences in life. At one point in the book, a boy beats up David, but David doesn't fight back. Angrily, the boy asked why he didn't fight back and David said, ""Because if I hit you back, I'd be no better than you are. I'd be just as rotten and worthless, and I'd have no right to be free!"" It's a lesson all of us can incorporate in our lives. This is always the first book I recommend to anyone."
4,A Lesson in Freedom,"This book nails the formula for exciting fiction: change throughconflict. And there's plenty of conflict. Young David is trying tomake his way north to freedom after escaping from a concentrationcamp. He must do this alone and at the risk of his life.

3,Rich with historical information but romance too much like Runaway....,"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this book and I plan on continuing the Florida series but the relationship between main characters, James and Teela was far too similar to the previous Jarrett and Tara's. I was hoping to discover a completely new and fresh approach to the dynamics between the lovers in this story but was a little dissapointed. Nevertheless, Heather again incorporates this fictional love story with real life events and peoples from Florida's past. I think Captive's theme was about overcoming all obstacles in order to obtain peace within and true love."
3,Enjoyable ...,"This was an enjoyable book. While certain aspects of the ""build up"" of the romance between the two characters played out a little long for my tastes, it was nonetheless a decent read."
2,"Okay, but disappointed","I am an owner of over 35 Worship/Gospel DVD's, and was very disspointed with Youthful Praise DVD. The MAIN song, their chart topper, was excluded from this recording, but misleadingly on the menu. The audio is very basic. Disappointed in the song selections and I am a HUGE YP fan."
2,could be better,"The product works, but it could be less bulky when it comes to the locking shaft. Had a similar flip drill with smaller locking shift that worked great."
1,Misleading,"I bought three of these 'wireless webcams'. I was searching for wireless webcams and their website kept coming up in my searches. When I checked their site it seemed to be what I wanted.1. The first thing that struck me is that all the instructions indicated that this was a security camera2. There was nothing indicating how I should use it as a webcam3. When I did install the drivers etc... I experienced interference with my Wireless Hub. This was not supposed to be a problem, since the system has multiple frequencies. IT ONLY works when I plug out my wireless hubIn the end,I'm VERY VERY disappointed. I'm not in the US, and I can't imagine who I could sell this to."
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"This product is a waste of money. I returned it immediately. What initially interested me was that it was a cordless webcam, but it's only semi-cordless. You have to plug the camera into any outlet within range of the base. It's also packaged as a security camera to place anywhere in your home so you can remotely spy on a babysitter or snoopy roomie which would be good if the picture wasn't so terrible. I could barely see myself or anything else in the room even after fiddling with the settings."
1,I should have known better,"Returned the product yesterday. The best resolution 640x480 is useless. The software is useless. USB interface was the only good idea.AXIS 207 looks like the best alternative, LAN or wireless network, 1280x1024, indoor use only or view through a window."
3,Yoga for the seated set,"Having bought another Yoga video that made me feel as if I was mountain climbing when I wanted to relax, this video is just the ticket: Most of the poses are done seated for the older person in the audience or who has trouble standing for prolonged periods. However, at 50 minutes long, it is a bit difficult to incorporate into a pre-work routine, unless you are an inveterate early riser (I'm not!)"
5,Wonderful for older beginners,"I am 57 and wanted to start practicing yoga but was concerned about various injuries and age-related limitations. This video is just about perfect if you are just beginning and want basic instructions that emphasize safety, but you also want to get started and learn some poses. Also good warm-up before and relaxation after the poses. I appreciate the calm and relaxed way Lilias presents each pose and find her tips very helpful. The routines are easy to follow and not so complicated or strenuous that beginners will get discouraged. You can't go wrong with this set as a good, safe starting point at any age."
4,Libera matures with Visions,"Libera is a wonderful boys choir and in this release their arrangements are adjusted for maturing voices. (Several of the boys have been with the group for at least three CDs!) In past releases, men were included when a 'bottom' was needed to the sound. In this release, Prizeman skillfully arranges the tracks to utilize these lower boy voices to provide the 'bottom' instead, making for a more coherent sound. The new soloists are beautiful, showing the depth of the group. The remake of several earlier released tracks improved them, bringing better balance between the vocal and instrumental. Some of the new songs are appealing, but I did not find myself as transfixed by this CD as I was with 'Free'."
5,What's up with these missles?,"This toy is pretty close to the original, but the only thing that wasn't like the original are the missles. For some reason they decided to make the new missles really long. Other than that this toy is pretty darn close to the one i had in the 80s."
5,"Excellent G1 quality, memories","Superb! Although redundant in form and function to Starscream and Thundercracker, Skywarp is one-third of the triumverate aerial assault forming the core Decepticon offensive! Thank goodness Hasbro has the acumen to reissue these to the now grown-up kids (like myself) who played with the originals 20+ years ago!!"
5,Full of great tips and advice,I found Jennifer's advice and tips very clear and helpful...from treating simple colds to everyday maintenance. The massage techniques were especially helpful in treating my daughter's persistent cold and my allergies. My husband and I have spent the last five years cleansing ourselves of unnecessary medicines and chemicals. It's wonderful to have such a great resource available to treat my girls as well as ourselves.
5,Lots of fun & interesting beads to make.,This is a great book full of great ideas for all types & styles of beads. Good instructions. Recommended in your clay library.
4,Easy to Follow Instructions,I am quite an amateur at polymer clay but this book really helped me come up with some interesting projects. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. I recommend this to all polymer clay fans!!!! Thumbs up from me.
5,A celebration of n. Califonia art and culture circa 1980's,"A fascinating mix of poetry, fiction, art, essays and oral histories that celebrates northern California. Includes work by Jim Dodge, Peter Coyote, Lucia Berlin, Lenore Kandel, Peter Berg, Malcolm Margolin, Alta, Jack Forbes, Keith Abbott, Mike Helm, John Krich, Frank Polite, Ray Dasmann, Ed Buryn and Arthur Okamura"
2,poor quality body used,I bought 4 injectors. My mechanic installed them 2 were leaking fuel.I went and bought new seals for them still leaking. I put in the old injectors leak stopped. So the new REMANUFACTURED INJECTORS FROM AUS ARE POOR QUALITY.2 good and 2 bad.The injector body is very poor quality. Now i am going to buy 2 new and NOT REMANUFACTURED FROM AUS
4,Simple and Excellent,"This book is a wonderfully clear and simple teachings on waking up right now. Outside of any spiritual tradition, Tony points out the enlightened reality that is not reached by seeking, not found in the future but is always available and present immediately. Simple but radical."
3,Interesting Read...,"Tony Parson's seems to present the same type of spirituality as other spiritual teachers such as Vernon Howard and Eckhart Tolle. However, I feel Tolle and Howard lay more groundwork (i.e. a plan) to becoming a more enlightened person.Parsons basically tells you that all you need to do to become enlightened is...NOTHING. He seems to think that we're already enlightened. No matter how many times I try to grasp this, the main point escapes.If we were already all enlightened I don't think we'd be purchasing his book. For me, Tolle and Howard work much better. Even the Buddhist, Dalai Lama seems to have a better layout.Overall, I was unfullfilled and underwhelmed by Parson's offering."
5,THIS BOOK IS WONDERFUL,"I love this simple and beautiful book. Tony's descriptions of ""presence"" are as clear and beautiful as any I have ever read. I find myself entering deeply into that profound state just after reading a few sentences of his book. It carries the purest essence of truth, coming as it does from a truly liberated human being. I was especially intrigued with his ""dialogue"" which is guaranteed to bring out a great deal of ego resistance. But if you feel that resistance and defensiveness coming on don't get stuck there - read it again and again and you will resonate with the deep truth of his statements. His has great gentleness but also will come on strong against your ego. Read his along with Eckhart Tolle's book - ""The Power of Now."" Two awakened brothers."
4,How It Is,"As a dutch reader I needed the dictionary quite often as Tony uses a lot of subtle and rare english terms. I am still reading the book. Every night before sleep I read one chapter or sometimes only one sentence and start automatically contemplating and 'sensing' the message pointed at, which is always the same but approached from different directions.It is uncertain if I will finish the book before the book finishes me."
3,As it is? Maybe not so much...,"I read and read this book...and while it makes a few points that are sound...seems to be something missing here in the conclusions this volume attempts to bring to the reader. There are many volumes written on non-duality and related ideas...perhaps some deserve a look as well.If this is the first volume one reads on the matter, it might be a ""walk in the park""...otherwise, keep your heart and mind open and look to your own experience to guide you. Another reviewer wrote that while reading this book, something inside him lead him to believe this isn't IT. I had the same kind of experience both times I read it.I don't think this was an easy book to write; but it's just not ""bringing it home"" for me."
2,"Basically publishes press releases, never investigates","No need for a subscription anymore--just read it online, often for the really far-out articles and horrific theology (or lack there of.)A dangerous magazine for new Christians."
2,INEXPLICABLE AND STUPID.,I bought this book because its cover appealed to me. Big mistake; the supposedly sympathetic characters are simple minded and lacking in any real form of self awareness. The only reason for reading on is to find out how they will be saved in the end given their minuscule IQs.
4,I Can Be Wesley's Kind of Methodist,"Or, rather, I want to try. It struck me, as I read, how far we have strayed. I have come to the Methodist church after growing up Baptist, and despite my misgivings about some of it's practices orginally, I find myself in love with the dream of Wesley. This book helped me see some of his vision without getting overly deep (er, over my head, so to speak). At times, it feels rather like reading a book report. I found myself wanting to skim over some of the dryer parts. But, it was a worthy read, and I took some good notes for future study."
1,Not worth it.,"For me, it was not worth the time or money. Installed the unit, used it 5 times and removed it. Hand cocking with the cord works better and quicker. Does not interfere with your shoulder position. Anyone want to buy a used crossbow cranker. PM me."
1,A piece of junk,"The build quality is very poor. Can you imagine the nice-looking front panel is actually a piece of PAPER loosely (you can lift it up and see the back) attached to a metal plate, which is also loosely attached to the rest of the box? Worst, the one I got did not charge, and with a multimeter I found the output voltage is only 8.7 volt. I sent it back immediately.I purchased it because of the previous two five star reviews, so I don't want other people to fall into the same trap. You have been warned."
5,Schumacher Battery Charger,Completely satisfied. I always have liked Schumacher products. I highly recommend this product. I like everything about it. I found the best prices right here on Amazon.com.
3,"I used to love them, but now I don't.","It hasn't even been a month and the poor pillow already split open. My boyfriend is a carpenter and fell in love with this thing then he saw rice falling out onto his shoulders. I can probably sew it, but he kind of wants to buy a new one just in case. It has put him to sleep before which was nice. If you like the smell of Froot Loops and the feeling of sweaty balls on your shoulders, I'd recommend this."
1,Neck wrap,The neck wrap doesn't have enough beads it and it doesn't stay hot for very long. Would not recommend to anyone.
3,neck pillow,"Not my favorite scent, and instead of feeling soothing to my sore neck, it feels kind of heavy. It heats up well though."
4,Very Comfortable,The place I go to uses the similar neck pillow and I find it very soothing withsteam and heat. This product is even better with nice herbal smell.The nice weight on the shoulder; the heat lasts very long. My concern isthat I am not sure how long this wonderful & soothing smell will last.
2,"Okay for occasional, but not for frequent re-heating","I did massage for a number of years, and have always wanted to invest in one of these myself. I was looking at the expensive ones, but this one seemed similar and okay for home use. The package came in a reasonable amount of time and was packed well--not the shipper's fault at all. The company that makes it however, puts A LOT of strong fragrance in there. I understand having a little lavender but I was gagging a little on the volume of it and the camomile. I followed the directions for microwave heating, but it has been a couple of weeks, and I use it twice a day. It heats up well still, but my god it stinks like burnt rice now. My kids have requested that I stop using it because it just plain stinks. The cover is still clean, and it only stinks after a re-heat---but buy a higher quality neck pad with buckwheat or something if you are gonna need it for an extended time. Not spa quality for sure."
2,Revolution?,"I read this because I was interested in a book assigned to my daughter (sophomore in H.S.). Her assiginment was to report on a historical fiction book. She chose this book because it purportedly had ""romance"" in it. I found it far removed from any historical content. In fact, the romance is actually an abusive father-daughter relationship. One half the book takes place in England, the other half in the U.S. The Revolutiion or any historical event is tangential at best and it veers so far from having historical content that it is almost laughable. I personally found the book wanting in theme, character, plot and historical background."
2,Could have been better...,I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. The book started out good but got very dull when Martha left England and went to America. I wish the author would have spent more time on Harry because his character was much more interesting that Marthas. I was also confused by the deformity of her new born son's spine. Harry's spine was damaged in a fire he was not born that way so why would her child have a deformed spine? Disappointment is what I felt after the story was over because it could have been a lot better.
5,Marvelous McGrathian monstrosities during the Revolution!,"Martha Peake by Patrick McGrathMcGrath is a master at bringing real pathos and humanity to the sick, the twisted, the grotesque, who always populate his fiction. Here in relating the story of a father who supports himself and his daughter by displaying his miserably distorted and malformed spine to a nakedly curious public, the author creates a riveting tale, set against the seamy sides of eighteenth century London and pre-Revolutionary War America. The story, carefully wrought and skillfully developed, still must assume a secondary position to the amazing characterizations. Martha and Harry Peake live and breathe through the tempest of their lives in such vivacity, Dickensian, yet entirely McGrath. While far from humorless, this author never lampoons or takes even the minutest cheap shot at these painfully alive monstrosities of the human spirit and condition."
1,Martha Peake peaked on page one and went downhill thereafter,"Relying on an extremely enthusiastic review in the NYTimes, I bought this book. What a disappointment. Although it has some gripping descriptive passages, there is no consistency of motive or inner life. As a result, it is difficult to summon any lasting sympathy or admiration for any of the characters. Much of the narrative is told in the third person and gets tiresome. Some of the situations are simply not believable and much of the writing is hackneyed with trite, overused adjectives."
2,Unputdownable? Hardly!,"The Washington Post reviewer said this book was unputdownable. Yet I had to force myself to continue reading after about the first 50 pages. It took McGrath the first half of the book to establish that Harry Peake, although basically a goodheart, was driven insane by his alcoholism and guilt, etc. Enough already -- I got the picture! While Martha was sympathetic in the first half, she became annoying in the second half. She brought about her own downfall with her obsessive (vs. rational) concern about her father. Hard to get into a book when you don't care for the ""heroine."" Having said all that, I'm glad I read it til the end, to learn that things are not always as they seem. Doubt I'll read anything else by McGrath, though."
2,Slow and disappointing,"I found this book to be, quite frankly, rather dull. There were certain sections that were suspenseful, but on the whole, it was a difficult novel to finish. I found the constant switching between the points of view of Ambrose and William to the story in America, and then back to Harry to be confusing and misleading. While some may consider this well-written, I thought that McGrath overdid a lot of his descriptions. The characters were fully drawn, but I did not find any of them particularly likeable, with the exception of Sara Rind. Overall, I was very disappointed with this book, which had a lot of potential to be a great story."
3,A Novella's Worth of Material...,"It's a good story, a terrific story, really: the gothic atmosphere of Drogo Hall out on Lambeth Marsh, haunted by Harry Peake the Cripplegate Monster, his noble and beautiful daughter Martha. Great stuff. The evocation of Massachusetts Bay Colony at the time of the Revolution was excellent.But why did Mr. McGrath choose such a convoluted narrative structure? The narration-of-a-narration is unnecessarily complicated, imo. And the narrator's ""speculation"" about what might have happened to Martha in America is extremely unnconvincing. McGrath gets wrapped in many many knots trying to make this an integral part of the book and for the most part he fails. The character of Uncle William is flat and predictable and we spend entirely too much time listening to him wheeze and bark. Because of all this, I found long passages of the book quite dull which is a shame because the rest of the book is so rewarding."
2,Maybe the Goblin King should get out more...,"If you pan a comedy DVD because you ""never heard of Paul Rodriguez, Norm Macdonald, or Richard Belzer"", well...maybe the problem isn't the product. If you know comedy, you'll know these names. If you think the comedy spectrum runs from Carrot Top to Jeff Foxworthy, well...enjoy that vanilla ice cream.That said, you're getting what you pay for here - a machine gun riff through early material (the photos on the cover are a tipoff) by people who for the most part do better work elsewhere. Consider it a museum piece; a Time-Life collection of clips assembled for convenience. For completists; the curious might want to wait for a cheap used copy."
4,dated but funny,"After reading the other reviews I have to say true, it must have been taped in the early 90s, BUT excellent comedy never grows old. Jeanine Garaffalo is hysterical with her dysfunctional family deadpanning; Jim Carrey does an excellent imitation of both Sammy Davis Jr. and Tom Jones (his hips Never stop gyrating); Tim Allen in his pre-sitcom days perfecting his now classic grunting like an ape (pig?); Seinfeld's rarely seen Jason Alexander; Jeff Foxworthy drawing his Southern comparisons, and on and on. It's completely worth seeing if only to gasp at how different these comedians look today: Richard Lewis was a true Hottie and Chris Rock and Ellen DeGeneres must have been in high school. I'd give it three and a half stars because the hour and some odd minutes took me by surprise a couple of times with my laughing out loud but I'll round it up to four stars because I was able to watch without having to wade through cursing and crude racial comparisons -- always a banner day."
2,Old and not very good material,"This is obviously the work of someone who bought the rights to this material. The Seinfeld clip is exactly 30 to 50 seconds long and his name is featured prominently on the box. The DVD is poorly made and the material is short and old. I wouldn't mind it being old if it wasn't so short. (""The portions are so small."") The only reason to buy it is because it's cheap - and it isn't here, so don't."
5,Classic,I really enjoyed seeing some of the great comedians on this DVD...this DVD is not a complete show of all the comedians but it's shows some of the best segments of their shows...very funny.
3,Never Heard of Some Of These Comedians,"Chris Rock isn't very funny, and I've never heard of Paul Rodriguez, Norm Macdonald, or Richard Belzer, so they weren't too great. Ellen Degeneres was funny, though, because she talked about how things always are on airplanes. That was funny. Rosie O'donnell was funny too. I think this dvd was about the comedy before these comedians became who they are today. It becomes manageable by including: Carrot Top, Cheech Marin, Jim Carrey, Tim Allen, Jason Alexander, Jeff Foxworthy, 2 performances by Adam Sandler, Janeane Garofalo, Ray Ramano, Drew Carey, Jerry Seinfeld and Kelsey Grammer. 3 and a half stars."
3,"Heavily detailed, but useful for Property students","ALthough this text contains about 10x what the average 1L will need for a Property exam, it was a very helpful guide through a very difficult subject. It will remain on my shelf just in case I change the very core of my being and someday become a real estate lawyer. Students of Property: this is the ONLY text that will help you outside of the classroom."
5,"lots of questions answered, extremely well researched","For people that may have watched the TV series (like I did) and may have read some other accounts, it is refreshing to have a lot of unknowns revealed -- where Reilly was most likely born, what he did and debunked things he didn't do and things he could not have done -- legends attached to him that were not true. The documentary at the end of the DVD, ""Reilly, Ace of Spies"" tells how at different times he worked as a ""pharmacist"" when in reality he was peddling patent medicines. Money well spent on an in-depth look at the first Superspy."
1,Yawner,"wow didnt know you could write some much about so little ,I got it he was a con man. Could have delved into his ""spying"" with some expaination as to why it was called spying and not looking out for number one"
2,Good subject but...,"Sidney Reilly may be one of the most fascinating people of the 20th century, but this book bogs down in the tedious details. I understand that research demands things to be checked and confirmed so truth is uncovered. But a book demands to be read and that requires the reader to want to turn the page which I'm having trouble doing 100 pages in to it."
5,Fascinating story,"This is an excellent account, scrupulously researched of a truly unusual man. Hard to put down."
3,Enjoyable book that has become dated already,"PROS:- Easy to read- Useful and interesting sidebars- Excellent questions that the average guy on the street wants to knowCONS:- It's already 5 years old. Science and technology books quickly become obsolete in most cases.- The humor is mediocre. I never laughed out loud and rarely even broke a smile (versus when I read Bill Bryson, I do both fairly often). However, the so-so humor isn't annoying and it would probably be funny if you're drunk.CONCLUSION: When it came out, I would have given this book 4 stars. It's useful and educational. However, it's no longer cutting edge, which is what you need when you're trying to clone the perfect blonde."
4,"Very interesting read, Cool stuff","I thought this was an excellent book!It explore many fascinating futuristic concepts including cloning, genetic engineering, teleportation, artificial intelligence, and tim travel. It tries to break down convoluted concepts like quantum physics and wormholes into more simplistic language that your average Joe could understand. The book completely had my attention the whole way and it actually made me excited about the future (even though many/most of the concepts are pretty out of reach at the moment).For the most part, relating the more convulted ideas to pop culture worked pretty well. Sometimes, however, they went on tangents talking about which TV show/movie they liked or disliked (uhh... who cares?). The best thing about the book is that you really get into science in general... from biology to physics to computers. And science is awesome. So buy the book!"
1,"dumbed down science, humor is juvenile",Maybe this is a good book for science airheads and people who laugh easily but most of it didnt work for me. It was like reading a bad science article in USA today with lame jokes.
2,Pop Science At Its Worst,"Received as a present and typically enjoy pop science writing but this is too low-level for even me. In addition, I also could've lived without the authors opining."
2,"I LOVE Kupperman's Tales Designed to Thrizzle, but this early collection isn't funny","I'm just going to say it plain and simple, I'm a huge Kupperman fan, but this isn't funny. Snake and Bacon's Cartoon Cabaret is weird but boring, having no sense of unique satire. This seems to be Kupperman's earlier work and the comic strips leave you hanging and scratching your head. It just doesn't have the absurd insight or over-the-top humorous impact that his later work has. On the other hand Tales Designed to Thrizzle will have you laughing SO hard that people will think you are a lunatic if you read it in public, and I'm saying this in all honesty.I would skip Snake and Bacon's Cartoon Cabaret. But if you've read Thrizzle and want to see where it all came from, you might find this passively interesting. Just be ready to be disappointed if you have already read Tales Designed to Thrizzle."
5,The best comic art book of the year,"Mr. Kupperman manages quite a feat with his first collection of comics--the stuff is beautiful, funny, and worthy of repeated viewings. Not since the heyday of RAW or Elles Sont de Sortie have I been so excited about a comic book. Mike's obsessive line drawings are both crude and detailed, full of a horror vacuii (fear of blank spaces) intensity one usually only finds in, you know, ""outsider"" art. And the same bad jokes are made over and over again, making them even worse and even better each time Snake 'N' Bacon show up saying the same stupid stuff. When's the second collection coming out?"
3,Cheap chain link,The Good:Easy to assemble.Quality tubing and gate.The Bad:The chain link.Comments:The chain link is quite flimsy and was not crimped closed on the ends causing quite a few of the 'runs' to come undone and shift up or down in the span of the chain link. It took me more time to unroll and repair the chain link than it did to build the structure. Also my 14 pound border terrier has been able to bend the chain link allowing him to make holes big enough at the base of the chain link to escape. I have had to repair multiple spots to keep our dog contained.Overall I would give the structure and gate 5 stars and the chain link 1 star.
5,What was/is,"I loved it. I lived in New Orleans when some of the ""then"" was still there, and seeing all the changes is great fun."
4,Great writing,"The captions on the photos are indeed very informative. We moved there as newlyweds for a short time but have continued our association with New Orleans over the years. Lester Sullivan really explains the beginnings of the city beautifully. The only qualms I have with the book is with the photography. I find it very distracting that the photographer did not bother to line up the ""Now"" photos exactly with the ""Then"". When looking at this type of project you tend to focus on the details and I keep wishing that the photographer had done the same."
4,Decades of Change,"This is truly an eye-opening book of change in New Orleans. To compare the way things used to look to their current state is always fun and interesting, but this wide book and big photos make it even more so. Truly fun for any fan of New Orleans."
4,Just buildings,"Two page comparisons of old and new photos of mostly (except for a few after-Katrina shots) buildings in and near the French Quarter. The picture quality is good, and their size is almost whole page, with only a quarter or less of space dedicated to bottom page captions. Pages are plentiful too, if one considers that it's only buildings that are showed...The down factor is that these photos are more like still paintings than reminders of a living city: There are no people, either standing or working or doing anything (with a couple exceptions). No historical event can be recollected from these pages, only maybe mentioned as passing by in the few lines of text, but none from the pictures themselves.The price of the book is not unreasonable, and the editing is good, as well as the binding and paper quality, which all in all should not discourage New Orleans' lovers from enjoying it."
2,Don't waste your money- buy the CD's,"This DVD is a hodgepodge of several routines Newhart did back in the early part of his career, and most are abridged to allow him to get them all into the program.The ""Button down mind"" CD's have the whole things. Buy them- much better."
3,Canon PG-30 Black Ink Cartridge,"Printer ink cartridges are commodities, but like Kodak says, they are over-priced. So, it's best to know the price & buy whenever they are discounted. I've tried ""compatibles"" with not-so-good success, so I pretty much stick with OEM. I've never had a problem with Canon cartridges."
1,"not entirely refurbished, apparently",This printer cartridge seriously did not last longer than 50 sheets. Will not be buying refurbished printer cartridges online anymore.
1,Rip off,"Don't buy this ink cartridge. The price is low for a reason. There is barely any ink in this cartridge and runs out extremely quickly. Not worth the lower price. If you can, buy a more expensive one with more ink."
3,"works good, for a little while","We were excited to see this great price on ink. It printed great but quickly ran out. I know the cartridges we buy at the store last longer, this one only lasted a couple weeks for us. Personally, I'd rather pay the extra 5 bucks and buy it elsewhere and have it last twice as long."
4,Overall - Okay,"The shipping and deliver process was fine. I don't know if its ink cartridges in general or just this brand, but they always seem to run out so quickly! Or at least the program starts telling you to buy new ink in no time. I'm stuck with it because of my printer, so at least the price isn't terrible (in my experience- compared to Dell.)"
1,Worked For About One Week,"Put this ink in and after one week, my printer would not recognize that there was any ink cartridge installed. In all fairness, I can't say for sure it was the ink cartridge problem, or a problem with my printer. Anyway, I ditched my printer. This is a name brand so I would image you'll have better fortune than me. But good luck."
2,Ink but Not Canon/Fraud,"The cartridge that was sent to me was NOT Canon, but a Canon substitute. I NEEDED it when it came (shockingly, that is why I ordered it), so I didn't have the luxury of time to return it. The ink is still working okay-BUT my printer doesn't recognize it and always say low ink-annoying. Sometime for fun it says it is OUT of ink, but it is just kidding. There is still ink in there. I have to take it out and put it back in. Inky, just not Canon inky."
3,Ink ran out fast!,"I usually get my ink at walmart and I have to replace the black ink about every 3-4 months. This ink ran out way faster. I assumed they were all the same if brand new, but this one definitely had less ink than the cartridges I normally purchase. Will not purchase online again!"
1,Ink low,"Ink ran out way too quick, I had ordered it once before and it was fine but this time it was like there was no ink in the cartridge! Was very disappointed"
4,Unsure,It prints well. But it also shows the ink is still running low as it wasn't changed before. Not sure if it will work as long time as normal.
2,These work but not for long,"This sale was a bit misleading since it states under condition that this product is New. It is not, its a refilled cartridge which originally did not bother me, however, like many refilled cartridges, they dont last like a manufacturers sealed cartridge does. They do work in my printer with no issues, but normally cartridges last me approx. 2 1/2 - 3 weeks with my use, and the first one I used just ran out after less than 1 week. Even with a great low price, this was not a good deal for me. I will go back to the sealed manufacturers ink cartridges."
4,Pg30,"Too expensive and runs out way to quick, I think they actually reduced the amount of ink in each cartridge, that or they dry out. Price does not fall Canon is a rip off, but better than others, if you can find cheaper Target is a good choice go for it, otherwise Amazon is best even if pricing is not competitive."
5,I ordered this and got 2,"I thought I was ordering 1 pack of ink but when it arrived it was 2-- AWESOMEAt 8 dollars a thing of ink , I ain complaining a all.Bravo Zulo ---- Amazon -- and it came 1 day ahead of time"
1,avoid,"Canon printers need new cartridges every 9 months, whether the printer is used or not. i only print black & white, yet the printer shuts down completely unless a full, but old, color cartridge is replaced with a new one. Went back to HP where printers print even if one cartridge is empty."
4,Do these things come half-empty?,"I swear I buy 4 of these a month....but it works with my Canon MP210, and this is the cheapest place to get it. No problems with them, 'cept for that itty bitty capacity."
1,"Nope, it does not work (more than once)","Like the customer above; it worked once, and that was great .... but the battery does not recharge. I note that the manufacturer does not sell these anymore. Hmmmm."
1,Doesn't Work,"This item does not work as advertised. My son received it for Christmas last year. We would charge it according to the directions, but it never went higher than 4 feet. Typically it would just skate along the ground uncontrollably at 6 inches. Do not waste your money on this toy. My son had read the product hype and was very disappointed that it didn't work as stated."
3,Good entry level book,"I purchased 8 books on photography after I completed a photography course.This book was one of them. It covers many of the things I already learned in my course but gave some specific f-stops that my course instructor never told us.My teacher felt we would learn more by taking the shots ourselves.I disagreed.I felt this book gave practical advice on how to set your f-stop to achieve the desired photo.It is a book for the beginner and easily read.There are lots of photos but I would have liked them to be a bit larger.For anyone who did not take a photo course or has not figured out how to play around with your f-stops to get the desired shot, this is a handy book to read.It also briefly touches upon diffusing the flash, exposure settings and other topics every photographer needs to know about, but in a general way.Definitely not the book for intermediate or advanced photographers, but recommended for the beginner."
4,Excelent for the entry level photographer,"This book is a quick read, but is all useful information without a lot of rhetoric. It's great if you're just starting out in photography and want to learn the basic adjustments that you can make or want to learn some basic techniques for taking decent shots. When I got this book, I had a VERY basic knowledge base of photography, but found plenty of useful tips to speed up my learning curve."
1,Doesn't Work,"Tried this product and it doesn't work. The outside gets dangerously hot and will burn you if you touch it, not good if kids are around.Then the steam is very weak from the inside and the really is not worth any money to buy.I would accept this product if it were free. Hope this helps."
2,No way,"I haven't found yet anything that this steamer can do. I took it to a couple of business trip and tried to smooth out wrinkles from pants, short, T's and shirts with no good results. It's too much work for very little result. The device is very difficult to hold and run down the clothes."
4,Great for travel,"Have used this once for travel. I am very happy with it!! It is small and lightweight, so good for packing. Did a nice job of freshening up silk scarf, cotton and cotton/polyester items. Have not tried it on heavy duty items such as men's jacket or linen material. Of course, will take a little longer to get job done than larger, heavy duty version, but who wants to pack that extra weight?? Dual-voltage a definite plus for international trips."
3,Good for light fabrics,It's almost impossible to steam a heavy weight linen shirt with this steamer. A suit took some doing but I was able to steam it lightly. The steamer did not get all the wrinkles out of the suit even after two refillings. This steamer works for light - medium fabrics.
3,Adequate for a travel steamer,"Let me preface that it is a travel steamer and therefore some of the limitations are inherent to its purpose, size and design. However, I found the unit to lack in power and water capacity, making the steaming of most garments a slow tedious experience requiring me to let the unit cool and refill it for the next piece of clothing. Dual voltage is a plus although it will require a plug adaptor. Adequate, but I was hoping for more."
3,Travel Steamer,The steamer is easy to use but does not get out tough creases just light ones. Easy to pack for trips and lightweight.
1,stop working after 2nd time use,After only used twice and it stop working. very cheap stuff. Don't buy this one.
3,not the greatest,I had searched for a very good garment steamer to take when I travel. I thought I'd found it with all the good reviews BUT it seems to take a long time to fill this steamer & then it puts out very little steam. I had no problem filling the water & I like it being compact.
4,pretty satisfying,"For what it costs, I am pretty satisfied with it. It is very compact and easy to use. It holds enough steam to do only one shirt, and you have to wait for it to cool before doing another round. Still, it is a pretty good travel for a 1-day or 2-day travel."
4,a good buy,"I bought this travel steamer to take with me on a cruise and it is worth every penny. It did a good job on most of my clothes. The only draw back is, given its size, I was only able to steam 1 or 2 items at a time before I had to refill."
1,Totally worthless,"I've never written a review before but this item deserves comment, since I can't return it (30 days have already passed). I bought it to take with me on my destination wedding trip. Really, it was utterly useless. It does create some steam and warmth, that can get a few wrinkles out. But it takes so long, the item is so bulky, and the overall effect on the garments is so miniscule, that it was really pointless. Luckily our hotel had an iron."
2,Would not Recommend,"Got this steamer as a quick and dirty way alternative for not ironing...Its exactly what i got.... Its good enough for the price, however, the handle is a little flimsy, as the only joint available is at the base. If you have big hands, you may want to think twice...In order for the steam to get started, you have to wait for like 5 odd minutes... and then, the outer casing of the device gets hot.... which makes it un-comfortable to use.All in all, good for the price, but not worth the hassle..."
2,Steamer Review,"Sorry to report that this doesn't work as well as I'd hoped--it's just very weak. I ended up having to get a larger steamer. Wish I had returned this but I was caught up in the chaos of my wedding and couldn't find the packaging, etc."
1,Not good,"I was really excited about this steamer... but I returned it, because I hated it. The design is so awful, not very comfortable. It feels flimsy and the head keep turning to one side.... very cheap! It drips like crazy and I ended up with a wet silky top. Considering that the water container is very small, plus the dripping, I could not finish one single blouse without having to refill it.... wait, if you need to refill it, you have to wait for this useless thing to cool down. I am still looking for a portable steamer."
2,"Interesting learning concept, kindle version needs improvement.",The ebook version for KIndle dictionary does not recognize many words highlighted in the story. so why bother..your better off buying the paper book. I do think it`s a good learing concept reading the paper book...but the ebook...forget it...save your money.
1,Not worth your money,"Simply put, this album corrupts Howard Shore's music in the same way the ring tried to corrupt Frodo. The more you listen to it, the more you realize you should have bought the original soundtrack."
4,Lord of the Rings,"Yeah, the music is very good, no doubt about that. I expected the vocals, especially because I wanted the original of Into the West by Annie Lennox, so that was a huge disappointment, but the CD is very good if you are happy with an instrumental version"
1,"Really, really, REALLY BAD!","Bought and returned it with the first few minutes after sliding it into the player. The cover art is nice. As for the, um, muzak, I expected something less...fuzzy. Even the player hated it, spitting it out within seconds after tasting the first track.If any of the original movie scores rate 5 stars, this rates a solid 10 black holes, IMHO."
5,Long Lost Memory Resurfaces,"For the last twenty years, I had this vague image of a rather ecletic book as a child.I asked everyone I knew did they remember a child beatnik. One winter visiting St. Louis I described the book to a book seller and she replied ""Suzuki Bean"" I tracked it down, got a first edition hard cover that set in a place of honour in my home. There was never a book like it (or since) and it brings back those warm precious memories of being and reading something a little different from your friends. This book is a must have for the ecletic parent. A ""Beat"" version of ""Eloise (at The Plaza)"""
1,who cares if its pretty?,"This is just another over produced, over hyped hollywood horror wanna be flick. Jenifer Lopez is the WORST, I repeat WORST model gone actress I have ever seen. The plot is redundant, the characters are boring, and in the end, Lopez's character weeps for the psychopath that has murdered countless women. Give me a break. If you want to hand over another 20 bucks to hollywood for giving us yet another mtv generation scream-esque horror movie, be my guest."
3,it is ok,"this is basically a 255 page quiz book about rock,pop,and soul music. the questions cover 1950's to 1980. the questions are all different:about songs,about singers/groups,about oddities,etc. there are different pages on individual singers and groups like:buddy holly,beatles,sly,janis,supremes,stones,led zep,too many to list! it is fully illustrated with black/white photos.most of these photos i have seen in my life time but,some i have not seen. my onecomplaint is that none of the photos have the person/people identified. the famousones we would know but,a few i am not sure of... altogether,a nice ""curiosity"" book for people who love pop music and want to test their knowledge.**** a note to ABBA fans,there is a photo of the group on page 217 and the blonde(agnetha) is wearing QUITE the outfit!!! it looks like an early 1970's space cadetslash tight"" hot pants"" suit, complete with pirate boots!!!--must see the photo to appreciate it!****"
1,This item is an error,"As far as I can tell, this item does not exisit. I am currently cataloging the works of Darrell A. Posey. W. L. Overal"
5,Gift was a hit!,I sent this Cheese assortment to a good friend and she loved it! How can you go wrong with cheese?
1,Does anyone care,"This guy is the typical rap artist, in that his talent begins and ends with inventing a snappy name for himself. If prepubescent teens ever develop either a thimble full of brains or a modicum of taste, terds like Notorious B.I.G. will spend their days on the back ends of garbage trucks, where they belong."
1,review of Notorious BIG: Bigger Than Life,I bought the movie and it never showed up on the download window. Do not purchase this video
3,Works,"It does work. There are, however, a few drawbacks. I purchased this charger based on the reputation of a company in business for many years..... Wrong move. Although the charger does the job as required, it has some faults that could be rectified easily if the company cared to.++There is no power switch. You must always unplug the unit when not in use.++The instruction book is unclear. It was writen to cover several models.++The clamps are cheaply made. They do not hold tight and are poorly insulated.++The charging cables are light gauge. They heat up during charging.++The meter is in percent. Charged, discharged, or charging rate? Instructions don't say.I would recommend you purchase another model/make, although I don't know which."
3,Chinese qaulity through and through !,Right out of the box the entire outer case was bent on both sides. I easily just squished it back to shape.Then noticed the one cheesy screw holding it all together underneath. Screw is about to fall out.Like everything else we buy these days that says CHINA on it. I'll have to make it more useable.I'll just rivet it together.I do like the sweep gauge and 2 lights that tell you something. Reviews on the LCD screens said they are no good in the sun. So I bought this. Schumacher should get involved in quality control though.
1,Pile of crap,"Will not charge a battery very much at all. Does not recognize the proper voltage a battery must be charged to . The computer will not allow enough charging time so the battery does not charge much at all. Now is used as a display piece. I suggest that you get a manual battery charger that does not have the automatic feature. I got a small Battery Tender and although it charges slowly the battery is able to get a full charge.I did not realize the battery charger did not work correctly until after the return, warranty period was over. I am stuck with a white elephant.Avoid automatic battery chargers if you can. Automatic is a feature that is nice if it works right. This one never did."
1,"Useless, Made in Mexico","US company thats been around since the 1940s but charger was made in Mexico? I bought this charger for my small John Deere mower because the batt keeps going dead. I have charged the batt all day and the lawn mower still will not start, even on the 50 Amp setting. When I tried using the 50 Amp setting the charger blew the breaker on my house. I have to use my truck with jumper cables to start it. This charger is too weak to even jump a small lawn mower."
4,ok,the charger works good when the battery is charged the needle jumps back & forthwould be better if it goes to zero or turns off.
3,Quality not the greatest,"We bought this Schumacher SE-5212A Automatic Handheld Battery Charger a year ago and it did what it is supposed to do. It charged the battery and jumped our chevy avalanche on several occasions. However, the cable coming from the charger is not reinforced at the beginning and it began fraying after the first couple of uses. The last time we used the charger it actually tripped our braker. I thought wrongly the higher price meant better quality but now I just replaced it with another cheapo charger from amazon. Worked one time already and if that one dies in a year I won't cry about it. Sending the first charger back for repair would be a financial joke for the customer - and the manufacturer knows it."
5,Great charger!,"Great charger, works as described. I had a similar product for years and years that finally quit working a while back. The price was certainly right, as well. The cheapest I've seen this charger locally was $20 more than I paid on Amazon - plus with Amazon...no tax and free shipping! It's really convenient that it is automatic, as well."
2,Dissatisfied,"I bought this charger earlier this year, it still works but it hums so loudly now that I can hear it in the next room. It also gets very hot when plugged in for even an hour. I have a manual schumacher battery charger for over 15 years it still works and does not Hum at all nor does it get hot. I hope this is just a defective unit and Schumacher has not traded quality for price."
4,"Works great, could use a power switch.","I have used this charger for cars and motorcyles. Trickle works great. 10amps works great. 50 amp will not start a totally dead car so im not sure what purpose that setting serves... This has been a great charger, it cycles on and off to keep the battery fully charged. I would like if there was an actual on/off switch for it, the switch right now is weather plugged in or not.Overall a nice quality affordable multipurpose charger that should last you YEARS!"
4,Seems OK,"I've only used it a few times, but other than the quite loud noise it makes, it seems to work properly. At a little over $50 it was a bargain."
4,Battery Charger,"Charger works real well, my miner complainant is there are no rear pigs to wrap the electric cord or jumper wires, so they can be stored out of the way,when not in use."
4,Perfect addition to my garage,"I would have given it 5 stars, but did not have the opportunity to evaluate the 50A charge/start mode. Overall this unit functions perfectly, and its light weight and ample AC cord and battery cable length make it easy to hook up and use. I have used other chargers previously, but none had the automatic shut off and trickle charge modes."
5,Schumacher SE-5212A,Great value and quality a company that stands behind their product that will last for years
3,Meter works not linearily.,It does charged my dead battery. But the meter jumps from 0% to 100% suddently by the end of the charging cycle. Considering return of the unit.
4,As described,Works just as expected. Charged car in from very low to full just a couple of hours. Seem very heavy duty.
1,What's in this book exactly?,Can anyone tell me what's in this book? I'd like to know before I make the purchase.
5,RIP LOST,"Watch it, Lost is one of the best shows ever created. It made me cry twice. Strong conclusion to an amazing & new series."
1,Monumental letdown,"My wife and I devoted six years to this show, only to be betrayed at the end, and indeed over the course of the entire final season, by lazy story telling and the false promise that the Island's secrets would be revealed. I own DVDs of the first five seasons that are now utterly unwatchable. What a colossal waste of time!Signed,Utterly Disappointed"
1,Cheese Fest Extraordinaire,"""The island it was mythical, but in the end they died. I didn't understand it, but I tried.""Jimmy Fallon chose a song titled: ""Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)"" for his backhanded Lost tribute.IMO that says it all. I'm using my S1-S3 DVD's as coasters. Wasted potential, wasted characters and a waste of time! Good riddance indeed."
3,going great until the end,"Although i was extremely unsatisfied with the end, I will most likely buy this set. My husband has all the other seasons and we have enjoyed them together. I watched last season as it aired but my husband worked so I'm not allowed to tell him what happened and I am not looking forward to his reaction. Hopefully he will enjoy the end more than I did."
3,Worth buying if you are a die-hard collector,"I own every other season on DVD, so I will buy this one. Season 6 was mediocre. It felt like the spent the first 2/3 of the season wasting time and tap dancing. Then, the really ramped it up a notch and started cramming stuff into the last 4 episodes.But it if you want to complete your collection, otherwise spend your money on something else."
5,Awesome!,"This show kept me very entertained, I would watch it everyday one after the other and never got bored. I loved the fact that every show was sequential to the next in every piece of the story, that the more you watched, the more curious you get to find the reason why this people got lost in this magnificent, beautiful and dangerous island. If you like suspense, and tons of drama, you will enjoy this show very much. I did not like very much the ending, because to me a few questions remained unanswered, but probably because my expectations were so high up, and that was the only way to end it...in any case it was a great story and kept me addicted to it until the very end."
2,Lousy and disappointing,"The final season of 'LOST' was a weakly written and character centered wrap up of a great story that tried and failed to tie 5 seasons together. The story moved from being plot centered and left many seemingly important questions unanswered or even addressed. My wife and I were very disappointed with the entire last season and I still wonder about many plot twists that were ignored by the writers. In retrospect, it would have been better to stop watching after the conclusion of season 5.Totally disgusted."
4,A good finish,"A good finish to a good series that was getting a bit long in the tooth. Some of it made no sense, but that's likely from the writers stretching the story for more seasons than expected."
5,Lost! As Always Breathtaking,"The Sixth season of Lost is just like the 1,2,3,4,5 is amazing, questions are answers, questions are made, twists, mythology, love, death... Everything that makes Lost great. The Blu-Ray edition will be the tip of the pyramid for any Lost fan, there really is no point for a review section on this page as everyone that loves Lost has already clicked the 'Pre-order it now' button.So i'll fill my review by calling out all the idiots claiming its 'Too Confusing'... these people obviously don't watch Lost like others watch it. 'Confusing?' do you actually realise your watching 'Lost'. If you want television that doesn't keep you thinking, buy prison break or desperate housewives. For the rest of us who enjoy the mystery and are smart enough to understand how the show works and accept confusing situations (Which in the end, we'll have answers for). Take this blu ray and put it on the top of your collection."
5,Enjoy the Ride!,"I thought the final season was one of the best. Even though I had been warned by so many friends who had viewed it earlier that it was a waste of time and a huge disappointment. I thought the writing/plots were very well executed. I found the episode exploring Richard Alpert's past quite entertaining; and the exclusion of Ana Lucia from the gathering because she ""wasn't ready yet"", hilarious. Sure, I, like so many other LOST viewers, never had all of my questions answered (Walt's ""specialness""?), but at the same time, I truly enjoyed the ride from the beginning to the end. I think most of those that felt let down by LOST were those who wanted all the answers presented on a silver platter, and all the twists resolved. It wasn't going to happen. Just like life. So instead, the writers left alot of up to your intepretation - that was the best part of the whole ride!"
1,I wish I could un-watch this season,"The first three seasons of Lost were amazing. Season 4 was pretty good, and Season 5 was good. Season 6, however, was a complete disappointment. The ending was a total let-down and didn't explain anything. If anything, it made the series make less sense than before. If you're a Lost fan and have yet to watch season 6, I would recommend just not watching it. Make up your own ending, because it will be better."
3,Review,"Good price, I looked around and this was the best price for the DVD's. The DVD's worked great and we had a clear picture. We were really into it, so we ordered it shipped fast, what a bummer though the ending was totally lame."
5,Lost the FINAL Season!!!,We were so excited to finally have Lost's final season!!! We have been so eager to see the extra footage and learn more about what happened while Hurley and Ben were still on the island. Being that this was a blu-ray box set the quality was amazing! I'm so glad we chose to spend the extra money and buy the blu-ray.
3,Pretty much really good!,"This is the same high quality LOST DVD package we have come to expect. My one complaint is that with a universe as broad and expansive as LOST is, I feel the Special Features are a little on the sparse side. The Prime example is ""The New Man in Charge. It started awesome, and I loved it, but when it was over, I had the same feeling I got when, back ini the day, I was watching an episode of LOST, and the TV went out.NOOOOOOOOOOO!"
5,Greatest Series of All Time,"If you agree, and the enlightening experience itself has changed your life more than any review I can write would describe, click ""Yes."""
2,Way to ruin a great show by giving it a poor finale,"I followed this show for years and was always fascinated by the world of Lost. The ending that is supposed to answer all the questions only leaves more to be explained. I wouldn't even be wasting my time writing a review because it makes me angry just thinking about all the time I wasted watching this show, but I couldn't let the 5 star review that one person gave go unchallenged! Save your time and money if you haven't already watched this season. It's a big let down..."
1,Major Con Job!,The producers obviously NEVER had an ending for this show. They just built up audiences expectations and then never followed through on their promises. They're liars pure and simple.
1,Official so disappointed I feel like I wasted 6 years of my life!!!! Review,"What a disappointment. After 5 years of build-up weaving incredible mysteries and all that hype, the writers had nothing, but a ""Oh look, there's Chuck E. Cheese"" ending. They wasted half the season on the meaningless Flash Sideways world and answered little to nothing of the mysteries they utilized to keep us coming back for 6 years. Talk about a Long Con!!!! Darlton should be vilified and never allowed near a TV or Motion Picture script again.Best thing they can do with this Show is lock it away in the famous Disney-Vault for 20 or 30 years and then pawn it off as ""Nostalgia""."
2,why such a high price???,"Haven't bought this season yet. I'm wondering what on earth makes this collector's edition $100 more than the non-collectors edition? Sure it has 1 extra disc, but is it gold plated???I'll wait until the price is lower. I'm just not ready to spend this much, even though I really enjoyed the series and have all the previous seasons."
2,Dropped the Ball,"I was enamored with this show until the end of this season. To use a football analogy, it was as though they carried the ball diligently and with only a few hiccups until the one-yard-line and then dropped it. I felt as though it they were more concerned with comforting their audience then tying up the plot. I felt like they basically took everything that had happened over the last five seasoned and made it all totally irrelevant in the final episode, most of which, made little or no sense.I would still recommend this show as a whole and I had a great time watching the other seasons and watching the characters develop, but I was monumentally disappointed with this ending, especially when the rest of the show was a great display of creativity and courage."
1,Final episode was a joke!,"We were all waiting for secrets to be revealed, but they weren't. The ones they did reveal were lame. This was the worst finale I have ever watched. It ranked up there with the final episode of Seinfeld.I'm hoping this was all just a sick joke and the real final episode will be coming out soon. I can't wait to see it."
3,GREAT SHOW,"This is the best show ever ! Definitely watch it, just not here. The quality was AWFUL. I know it wasn't my computer or internet. I have a brand new computer and had perfect reception of my wireless. But it would skip and slow down and would not flow ! GET SOMEWHERE ELSE ! Complete waste of money!"
3,Disappointed with the whole 6th Season,"I was hoping for a somehow meaningful ending to various mysteries in the series. However, the season does not only leave most questions unanswered but also damages the character profiles i.e., characters seem bold-gutsy in previous 4-5 seasons all of a sudden appear weak, unsure of themselves and so on.All in all a rather disappointing end"
5,My LOST Experience,"What got me into the whole LOST series was the reaction from the series finale. From the things people liked about it to what people hated about it, I wanted to start watching it, so I could make my own opinion.What many people made theories and speculations on week after week were the mysteries of the mythology on the island and many weren't satisfied with the conclusion because their own questions weren't answered.I personally understood and loved the ending, gave a whole meaning to the series of redemption that the island gave the characters, a second chance to become a better person, and live with purpose in your life.It all depends on what you like, you didn't like the finale? Fine.But it's not a reason to write off the series all together."
4,Just fine,"It is not an amazon problem, but I have seasons from 1 to 5 with audio in spanish, but this is doesn't have this option, but with subtitles is ok."
2,Boring,"See why this was the last season - plots got old. Sort of lost its edge, for me. Disappointing!"
2,Lame ending to a great show,"There is only one truly great episode in this entire season -Ab Aeterno, which ranks among the series best episodes. The series finale is emotionally moving but a complete joke on an intellectual level."
1,A STINKER OF A SEASON AND A LET DOWN,"Despite strong performers and high production values, LOST's Final Season was a HUGE let down.I'll pretend it was some strange ""flash-upside-down"". I'd rather be left with unresolved mystery than an insulting, lame 'let's walk into the light' ending that diminishes the very parts of the program that were enthralling for 5 seasons.Well, they made their money I guess. Now they're crying all the way to the bank."
3,Dude the ending sucked!,Dude the ending sucked!! But...I bought it to complete my collection. Looks good on the shelf.................repeated words don't count so adokjiafndsjva ihuavfgeprhgvakdscjvashuvn oafsdjivf asdovnasocjivmAS:i there.
2,terrible ending,"honestly it seemed like they threw the ending together without any thought or planning. so many questions left unanswered, holes left unfilled. such a disappointing ending to what started out as such a great series. Not worth even finishing. . ."
1,Awful Season to an otherwise Great Show,"I've had this season pre-ordered since February. After doing some thinking, I just can't justify the $47 price tag, especially after being so disappointed with it. I've already seen the 12 minute epilogue, and I don't really feel like watching this series for a 4th or 5th time...especially with the way it attempted to ""wrap"" things up. Maybe when this season hits around $25, I'll buy it. The whole season is awful and unrelated to the rest of the series."
4,Lost,I loved the series lost but the last season had me totally lost. I enjoyed it but still have many questions that have continued to go unanswered by the TV show
3,Still LOST,"I was mildly disappointed in LOST's final season. I had hoped for more answers to unanswered questions. Well done visually and the acting was, as before, consistent in terms of character development... however, a bit of an anti-climax after five prior seasons of what-the-heck-is-going-on-here plot twists, time shifts, and magnetic field fluxes. Still, I'm looking forward to watching the entire series from the beginning sometime just to pick up on things that I surely must have missed in the first viewing."
5,lost without lost,I am so lost without lost..ive been enthralled with every single episode from day one.this is 2012.and I never got into any real. Tv episode before but ive been so captivated by all series irregardless if they made sense or not.eventually it all came together..the best part is every main character is so significant in making the lost series successful.I would love to see all these characters come back together to perform and create another series with same idea..I loved the back n forth from island to real life to get to know each person.when I watched last episode I cried because I felt like I was losing my friends.I watched for weeks and even though I know what's gonna happen am going back to the beginning...loved them all (actors - script -setting) come back to the island!!!!!
4,Oh well,"I thought Lost was one of the best mini series I've ever watched. I am glad that I didn't start watching it when it first came out. People must have been going crazy waiting on the next episode. I didn't like the ending either, but I enjoyed watching all of the episodes."
3,Disappointing ending to fantastic series,"Over 5 seasons there has been a build up to the final climax, but i am still searching for it.As much as the first 5 seasons left room for speculation and gave away the odd clue, the series finale is just a mess and does not live up to the first 5 seasons.I could be more specific, but don't want to give away the ending."
5,Best Show Ever!,"Lost, in my mind, is the best show ever! Nothing comes close. Yes, the writer's left some mysteries unexplained but there is a reason and a purpose for that. How can they explain everything when everything around them is chaniging (ie, Walt was a young and small when they started filming - now he's like 6+ feet tall)?I really enjoyed season 6 - especially ""The End"". That episode wrapped up everything for me. Watching the season again now I am picking up more things I missed in the 1st viewing. I think many of the cast should be up for Emmy's especially - Matthew Fox and Terry O'quinn."
1,"Wow, this one's a stinker","I've been trying to finish off the last season here... though this episode was tough to get through. I've always been a fan of Lost, but this episode didn't seem to have a ton of direction nor entertainment. It gets better in the next couple episodes...Hurley and Jack in the lighthouse? I'd like those 5 minutes of my life back. I'm sorry if that seems harsh, still a fan, Jack just gets a little annoying."
1,Typical,"This was the last time I watched TV, I canceled my cable shortly after this last season. It proved to me how bad Hollywood in general has gotten, they have no substance anymore, no character, no talent, nothing.All TV is anymore is reality TV, and shows such as this that leave the audience wondering what happened over the last few years while watching this?"
3,Not my favorite season but still LOST,"I love LOST. My favorite show ever. But I didn't like Season 6 as much as 1, 2, or 3. It has a lot of crazy stuff as you can expect from LOST haha. Sometimes its a little too much for me.But hey, its LOST, and LOST is the best show ever!"
3,So Many Questions left Unanswered,"A lot of time was invested in the six seasons of this show with so much promise. But it was always even, sigh, unto the end, two steps forward and one step back. Question after question presented and just when you think there is an answer, another curve ball was thrown in the plot, which could have been totally delicious, alas if all the rabbit trails we were sent down, had rabbits at the end of them. It was not to be. I could have added another floor to my house with all the time invested in Lost and then was left dangling."
3,Lost - Ended with more questions than answers...,"Well, I kinda expected that the writers would have answered a FEW more of the questions that they had posed. I figured they would leave it somewhat open-ended to leave the option for a movie or another series, but come on... Only two or three answers to the dozens of questions? What was the reason for the Darma Initiative? Who was behind it? Stuff like that. Sigh. Oh well, it's over. The overall experience was somewhat of a let-down. For a die-hard fan, it was probably awesome, but I found very little of substance. Sadly, the writers seem to have focused to much on trying to create Star Wars on the beach, and not taking advantage of what they had to work with."
2,6 years waisted watching LOST,"After 5 awesome seasons, the last one sucks.But the quality of the blue ray is ok."
2,do yourself a favor and skip it,Do yourself a favor and pretend this season didn't happen. The season opens up with some promise but ends in failure. I loved this show for 5 seasons but I would never have imagined such a lousy ending.
2,Aw Comon . . .,"The ""religioso"" ending with all the good guys meeting up in Heaven is what - a disappointment? Writer exhaustion? Hollywood gone amok? A cop-out? Throughout the 6-year run, like many other reviewers, I had my suspicions about the writers doing a mass improvisation from episode to episode, but I was usually willing to go along for the ride (hell, it was entertaining and engrossing!), looking forward to see how our heros would deal with their latest fix. Even throughout seasons 5 & 6 I was totally into it, watching what I suspected to be some kind of parallel universe unfolding, with the twist of the characters slowly coming together in the later episodes. Of course everything logically pointed to some sort of supernatural ending, but ""logic"" never struck me as being a word to describe Lost. Something more creative was called for."
1,Why waste 6 seasons?,"What started out as a great series eagerly followed by fans was made into a mockery by this last season. It is as if the writers all quit and then the producer told everyone to wrap it up in a hurry and they developed a quick, unsatisfying ending. Rather they had made a 2 hour movie if that was the intended way of the ending."
1,So Very Sad.....,I'm not going to repeat all the problems and praises of this series but suffice to say.....So Very Sad.
2,Lost Season 6: the Black Stain of the series,"I sincerely wish I didn't have to give the final season my favorite show of all time a bad review, but despite all the good episodes like Ab Aeterno, Across the Sea and Happily Ever After, this season was ultimately ruined by the travesty that is The End. Many people have already pointed out the piece garbage this episode is and how it ruined the series so I will not go into depth on it. Ultimately I give this episode 2 out of 5, and the title of Black Stain like the box art portrays."
2,Great Series Terrible Ending,I loved the series but was very dissapointed towards the end. It started great but just got weird and not fun to watch anymore.
2,Not as good as the others,"A rather cliche' ending to the series. Truthfully this show started getting bad after about the second season.The streaming service was great, the show just sucked."
4,No Portuguese Subtitles available in this Version,"I have my "" Lost - The Final Season 6 "" , blu ray , and ABC unhappy didn't add portuguese subtitle .* Portuguese Version > Pessoal , infelizmente a Produtora ABC no colocou legendas em portugus nesse último box de Lost . Tem legendas até em noruegues , sueco e finlandes ( que por incrível que parea nem so da AREA A , ou seja , so europeus e mesmo assim tem legendas nordicas , mas as em portugus para o público brasileiro que faz parte da área regional dos EUA em Blu Ray foi excluído . Mais uma vez )Lamentável ."
1,What Did Y'all Expect...It's a Stupid Show!,"The whole show is stupid from the beginning of season 1. It's nothing more than a daytime soap opera with a bigger budget to allow for more special effects. There were never any rules of the world that was created other than there are no rules, so essentially anything goes from episode 1 of season 1. Lame! That's exactly what happened throughout, ideas were made up and implemented as the show moved along, and over the course of 6 seasons the ""geniuses"" behind this lame show found themselves boxed in a corner with no winning way out. They were actually boxed in a corner long before and at a certain point just kept getting more ""lost"" in their box to a point of no return other than more and more garbage. The ending was actually fitting for such a stupid show."
1,"Hurry, they pulled the plug!","Season Six - Well to me the final season was a complete dud. It felt as though the writers happily went on their way never planning an end to the show. Then one day in the early stages of writing for Season 6 someone said, ""This is it, the show is dead this year"". All writers scrambled with silly ideas to end the show."
1,"The Worst of Last Seasons, For The Best of First Seasons","With the exception of ep9 (Ab Aeterno) - season 6 of LOST sucked hard. For me, Ab Aeterno is ep2 of season 5, and Juliet blew up LOST at the end of season 5. OMG, season 6 was such a major letdown. You could really tell, ep to ep, that season 6 was written nowhere near as well as or with as much zeal as ANY of the first 5 seasons.I will buy season 6, to complete my LOST series on DVD, only because I need ep9 (Ab Aeterno)... but I will wait until it hits rock-bottom pricing."
1,Bad Television,"I began watching Lost and enjoyed the adventures, cliff hangers, and beautiful scenery. Finding out new things about the characters and making discoveries on the island was a great week to week adventure. Then Season 6 happened. It was pure drivel. I understand metaphor and symbolism....this season was pure fluff. They took a great show and completely butchered it by insulting the viewers with this horrendous pile of rubbish. Just stop watching after season 5 and feel fortunate."
3,Excellent recording,"The product is an excellent and clear recording, unfortunately the material was disappointing. I stopped watching LOST after the 5th season and after a couple of years had passed I was curious about what I had missed. When I watched this final season it reminded of the convoluted and ridiculous storyline which prompted me to stop watching after 5 long and tedious seasons. I started out loving the show, but each season became more and more bizzare until I could not stand it any more. At least this set reminds me that the nonsense is finally over!"
3,Still PO'ed at the ending.,Christian Shephard? C'mon son.I watched a BBC series called Paradox (available here on demand). But the main character's name gave it away too. Still a good watch.
5,Lost 6 - the final season,"I purchased this DVD set at the request of my son. He enjoyed this series and I have purchased each season, as they have come out on DVD, for him. I am sure he will enjoy having this set."
1,No Audio Commentaries...,"I haven't watched all five discs but I have rented two from different sources and the results are the same: no audio is available if you select the bonus commentary.I rented Disc One from Blockbuster (an actual physical store) and all three episodes and the ""8:15"" recap played perfectly. However, when I selected the audio commentary for the first episode, ""LAX"", there was no audio. I tried various ways to get it to play but, in each case, there was no sound.I received Disc Two from NetFlix.com a couple of days later and its four episodes also played normally. However, when I tried to play the episode ""Dr Linus"" with its audio commentary, there was no sound.I also rented the last disc of Fringe Season 2 from Blockbuster. I played the season finale with commentary and it played just fine so the problem is confined to the Lost DVD box set only. I am so glad I didn't buy the box set, as I would normally have done in the past. It would have been a colossal waste of money."
2,What is the island?,"If you're a fan, and someone who never watched this series asked you ""What is the island?"", after watching 6 seasons, would you have an answer?LOST is a well-written, well-acted series with some great moments, but the reason for initially being drawn into the show is this central question. If you're expecting some explanation based in reality, you will be disappointed with LOST.Watch the DVDs and enjoy, but skip the final season and make up your own ending. Stick to your own theories and speculation about the island. They are what made this show fun to watch in the first place.What is the island? It's not what you're thinking. Unfortunately."
1,To Buy or Not To Buy - The Big Dilemma,I loved this series so much it seems absurb that I am questioning buying the final season.Man this final season was that awful. Should I get this just to complete my set or am I better off never watching past season five and ridding my mind of all memories of six?So far all I have is a scale full of black stones... with not one white one to convince me to own this.
1,Incredibly Bad End,"This show began deteriorating back in Season 4---but I honestly thought that, in the end, they'd come up with something mildly more interesting than warmed over new-age nonsense (""There is no now here, Jack""), spouted earnestly in front of a stained glass window bearing the symbols of most of the world's great religions (heavy-handed enough?).Could this have possibly ended more poorly? I won't even get into inconsistencies, red-herrings, omissions, and mistakes----I think that the 'brain trust' who led me astray with the futile hope that some creativity could be salvaged from Network media should simply be ignored in all future endeavors. I feel cheated AND evangelized. I do feel sorry for the actors---this piece of crap probably ruined some careers."
5,"Why don't they release cool ones like Megatron,Soundwave","O.K. Let's look at the facts. These re-issue transformers are the coolest thing to happen to us guys in our mid to late twenties. Collecting them has been a blast and I have been able to collect most of them I've wanted which is cool because some of them I never had as a kid. If anyone out there agrees with me please voice your concern. Why are they wasting time with transformers that no one really cares about? Who is richochet and skids and why would I pay high dollar for them.Hasbro needs to get with it and release Megatron, Soundwave, Shockwave, Insecticons, Galvatron, and other cool autobots and decepticons because their is still a lot to be released that I would pay high dollar for but not skids and richochet. How lame. However I am grateful for the ones I have and I think PROWL is way cool as he sits in front of me as I'm typing this. Very nice color and looks. I hope Hasbro keeps this up and releases the ones they should be focusing on."
5,Robocop :],"Ahhh! Finally! PROWL! Woohoo! ...ahem ok sorry about that. What can I say, I'm a 24 year old guy who hoped he could get his hands on the toy he got suckered into selling for a mere 1 dollar and forty five cents.... Yeah..I was very young and not very bright in ""math"". :p Anywho, this is a very nice reissue with metal parts still intact and those rubber tires we TF fans oh so love to smell...mmmm rubbbbberrr. If you're a fan of Prowl, I probably dont have to advise you twice to BUY IT! ps: I really wished Prowl had a longer life span in the TF movie :["
5,Absolutely enchanting - Even better than the first!,"As much as I love the first Celtic Lounge, I like this one even more. It has a gorgeous selection of songs by all my favorite Celtic artists from the first one plus some new ones like Tina Malia who has one of the finest voices I have ever heard. If you love artists like Enya and Loreena McKennett, the Celtic Lounge series is a great way to discover more great artists and songs in this style. I highly recommend this CD!"
3,"nice color, feels thin","I ordered this for my 10 year old daughter. She has borrowed my fleece jacket a few times, and wanted one. She loves the color and it fits well. She is thin but tall......you need to order up on size.My only complaint is that the material is thinner than my Columbia jacket. I hope it holds up as well."
1,No one liked it!,"I really, really love this product.With the recent flu problem going around...I was tired of people coming into the office sick...touching things...so I purchased bottles of this product and set them around the office. Everyone complained...that it was sticky, stinky...and basically rejected it. So...there you go. My whole office hated it."
4,Informative but a little dry,"Rypkema's book seems that it would be quite useful for preservation planners and has great examples, but it does tend to be dry. Not necessarily something you'd want to read cover to cover, but I doubt that was his intention, anyway."
1,Do Not Buy!!,"I bought this warmer after reading all of the other reviews- I should have listened to the advice. This warmer is activated by the shock produced from clicking the metal disk- however, it is also activated by slight bumps to the diaper bag or even by sqeezing it to hard when you pick it up! The idea is great, but this warmer is not worth the frustration of warm bottles three hours too soon!"
3,Not easy to use,"This is not easy to use, but there's really nothing else out there. We use the Avent bottles, and I find it takes at least 30 mins to heat up a 6oz bottle...forget 8oz. It's probably more suitable for a 4oz bottle. You can ""help"" the warmer by heating up the water (hotter than usual) in the bottle before you leave the house, and then stick it in this bottle warmer. When you need it, turn it on at least 15 min beforehand.The disc does activate very easily, so you need to be careful while handling. Also, after boiling, make sure you don't see any white stuff in the gel or else it'll activate again.We have a car warmer, but I haven't used it yet. I only drive short distances around town, and it's just not convenient to run to your car and let the engine run so you can warm the bottle for 15 min. So, I guess I'm stuck with this warmer."
2,"As a bottle warmer it stinks, but...","I bought this to warm bottles that were currently being kept cool with ice packs. In that case, the thing did not work. It got warm enough to knock the chill off the milk, but didn't come close to making the bottle warm enough that my son would actually drink it. However, I switched my approach so now, if I know I'll be giving the bottle in an hour or less, I'll heat the bottle at home and put the already warm bottle in this bottle warmer to KEEP the bottle warm. In that case, the thing works like a charm. I do the same thing to keep baby food warm. It really does stink if you're trying to heat something that's cold. I imagine that if the bottle started out room temp, it might get fairly warm. And if the bottle or food starts out warm, this will keep it warm. For that last reason, I love this thing. I use it at least weekly. But for an actually warmer... to make something warmER, it stinks."
3,Could be better,"I love the idea of this product, but it could be better. The warmer gets my daughter's bottle to the right temperature, so it does serve it's purpose. However, the warming device has self activated while in the diaper bag, so it was of now use when I needed it. Very frustrating! Also, it would be nice if the warming devices were sold seperately, so you could have a few handy for a long outing."
1,Worthless...,"I bought this item as we take a lot of car trips with our little one. I found that is constantly activates when you don't want it to, then when you do need it, it is unusable because you have to boil it between uses. Don't buy this it is truly useless!"
4,This warmer is awesome!!,"I just received this warmer at my shower and I have been playing with it ever since. It heats up so fast. I have not actually used it to heat up a bottle but it does stay warm for a long time. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because you have to boil it after every use in order for it to return to liquid. And when you take it out of the boiling water, if you move it around too much it turns solid again. But other than that, I love this and can't wait to use it."
2,Not practical,"I was attracted to the idea of having a bottle warmer that doesn't require electricity or a car adapter. But, while traveling, you don't always have the ability to boil the product. And then, it takes a LONG time to heat up the bottle. Babies often can't wait that long. My newest technique is simply to use tap water already at my baby's favorite temperature and put it in a thermos. The thermos keeps the same temperature for several hours (or I make the water really hot if I think that I won't be using it until later in the day). Obviously, not helpful for those using pumped breastmilk, but much less hassle for those using formula."
1,Horribly,"I had this item on my registry. It looked really cool and easy to use. I had a problem from day one. Finally, I gave it back to the store for a refund. Don't bother!!!!!"
1,Bad Buy,"I was going on a trip with my 3 month old across the county and bought this for the plane ride. As far as heating bottles, this does not work at all. You have to boil the bag after each use and let it cool down completely before trying to use it again which is a real hassle. It also activates when you don't want it to. Most importantly, it doesn't heat the bottle at all. It's a neat product, and I would recomend this for using as cordless heating pad for your sore muscles...but not for heating bottles."
1,junk,"1. Too heavy to lug around in diaper bag.2. Too big to fit in average size diaper bag.3. Gets activated with the slightest bump - not good if baby is not ready for a bottle!4. One time use then you have to pull out a pot and boil the thing, then lay it to cool.I wouldn't have bought this product if I had known what a pain it would be."
2,If I Must...,"I purchased this warmer because I am on the go all the time and often feed my baby boy while we are out and about. I have found that it is more trouble than it is worth. It is only good for a single warming and it takes about 15-20 (sometimes longer) to warm the bottle. Also, I use the drop-in system, so I have to warm just the bag...it won't warm at all if the bag in already in the bottle. I find it is just easier to carry a large big gulp sized cup in my car and fill it with hot water at a gas station or coffee place. It warms the bottle up in less than half the time. If I have no other options, I would boil this down and take it with me, but only if I had to. It has been sitting in my kitchen drawer now for a few months."
2,semi-happy,"i thought that this would be a great product to have since i am out often so it just makes feeding easier. my daughter likes her formula warm. the first time i tried it, it did take longer than i thought it would. i only warmed 4 oz and it took at least 5 minutes. i found that it helped the process if you swirl the bottle while in the warmer around a couple of times. my one major complaint is that i have taken it with me a couple of times and found that it would accidentally warm up in my diaper bag. it turns out that the activator disc seemed to have become VERY sensitive after using it. it basically just needs to be touched, not even ""clicked"" twice, like the directions say to start the process. so when i needed it, it was of no use. i am going to return this and exchange it for another one. i am hoping that this one is damaged. i am going to try my luck again."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"When I used this for the first few times it worked wonderfully! Then, it started hardening on it's own.....anytime from when I had just boiled it and laid it out to cool off on the counter to when it was in the diaper bag. So, when I went to use it, it was of no use to me. I found it MUCH easier to just go through a fast food drive through and ask for a glass of hot water, and warm the bottle that way. If I still had the box this came in I'd return it to Babies-R-Us. But, I don't have the box, so I'm stuck with a useless product. Bottom line is not to waste your money on this product until it's improved dramatically."
2,Not that great,"Very useful if you can transport it without ""clicking"" the disc that activates the warming solution, and if you do it is useless if you are somewhere without a stove and a pot of boiling water. But it does warm bottles really well, just have to learn to be extra careful with it."
1,Too hard to use,I bought this warmer thinking it would be easy but like other reviewers stated the liner gets hard too quickly and it takes too long to heat up. I was very disappointed and returned it to Babies R Us. I bought one that you can hook up to your cigarette lighter and it works much quicker.
2,"Takes too long to warm milk, and it's only lukewarm","I bought this to warm up refrigerated breastmilk when traveling. I only tried it once as it did not work very well in warming cold milk. When you press the button, you can feel the item warming up, but it never got really hot. After 15 minutes of warming, the bottle of milk was only lukewarm. Not very good if your baby prefers warmer milk. I did try the unit out before traveling, and it did work well warming up room temp water for formula milk. I had better success in warming up cold milk with carrying around a thermos of piping hot water and an empty plastic container to sit the bottle of milk in it and then pouring the hot water into the container when needed."
1,Not worth it!!!,"This is a terrible product! The idea is great, however the actual product is not. It worked once & then would harden on it's own. I tried a few times & boiled the product to it's liquid form only to have it harden on me before I could actually use it. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Terrible Product!,"I bought this based upon the good reviews this has had, but it is a terrible product! The first time I put this product into boiled water for 10 minutes to enable me to use it again, it split, leaking the crystals all over my counter top. It ruined the pan that I had it in, and meant a lot of cleaning up - who knows if they are toxic or not? I returned it to Babies R Us for a refund and the woman at the desk said she can't believe the store still stocks them as they are ALWAYS being returned by people! Don't waste your money!"
5,"Don't know how this works, it just does!!!","I LOVE this bottle warmer! What a godsend! My husband sent me to Babies R Us to buy a better insulated container for our daughter's bottles and bought this (though, admittedly, I was VERY skeptical). It works exactly the way it has been described, and I have had no problems whatsoever in getting it to reliquify or warm up again. This is great if you are a busy mom, out running errands for the day, or just going to the park or mall for a couple hours to get some exercise.I'm going to buy another as a spare and this will definitely be a gift I will give to every new mom to be."
3,eh- It's ok in a pinch.,"I'm 50/50 on this one. I've used it w/ success, but it requires planning. I always activate it 30-40 minutes before I need it. The (bmilk) bottles warm well under these conditions. It took me a while to figure out how to handle w/ out triggering. I usually gently lay it across the top of my bag until I need it. I have 2 so I can rotate them if needed.This is my theory, ""you get what you pay for"". It's $9.99. You get about that much quality and value. I'm satisfied, but they aren't as great as I'd like them to be."
2,"Good Idea, But....","I own one of these things and have used it once. To be perfectly honest, it is rather a pain. Yeah, it's cool that it heats up and all, but boiling the thing for 10 mins to get it back to its gel state sucks. It is also not very lightweight. I don't know about you, but with the amount of stuff I have in the diaper bag, the last thing I need is this thing weighing me down. I have found that keeping a clean bottle, a bottle of water at room temp and some powder formula (save your scoops) work the best for feedings on the road. And if you are at a resturant, it is far easier to just ask for some warm water. Then you don't have to come home and remember to boil this stupid thing. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,not worth the hassle,"Thought this would be great for quick trips to the mall or doctors office where you really can't ask for hot water. It is so aggravating because the button is so sensitive, it activates all the time. Then you can't reuse it without boiling it. It never gets the bottle warm anyway. Might as well just let the cool bottle come to room temperature on its own if hot water is not available."
5,Very well made.,"If you are looking for a sturdy rack and you are short on counter space. This would work well. I bought mine to use in the bathroom for all those little bottles, in place of the baskets I was using to try to make the counter neater."
3,So far I'm pleased with my purchase,"The items is as it appears on the website. It arrived within the time indicated at check out. It's made of good metal. Not flimsy. Holds several things. I used the top shelve to hold a two packages of sanitary napkins and one ""q"" tip container. while the bottle holds about 15 assorted toiletries. Works well with my 24 inch wide bathroom sink cabinet. But height is limited. You CAN NOT put those tall hairspray cans in the bottom draw or the top since the cabinet isn't high enough but standard body splash bottles or mouse cans just make it. Definitely worth the money. I would buy another one if only the piping for the sink weren't in the way.I might buy one for the pantry in my kitchen. Also have the option to screw the base into a surface allowing for you to open and close the draw without pulling the whole thing out I haven't screwed my down yet. I don't see the need."
3,Beware of the pricing options!,"I had a really hard time finding something cute to hold the large amount of toiletries I keep on my vanity. I can already see how the mesh might become a nightmarish dust collector (I'm crossing my fingers it won't happen). When I did the search what came up as qualifying for ""prime"" was about $35, & I placed it my cart... A couple of days later it went up to $45! When I searched for something else it came up again, I decided to look at the ""available new starting at $"" section, lo & behold, it was available there too w/prime shipping for $25!"
2,Disappointed with the quality,"This is so pretty in the picture but it is not made as well as it could be. The wire mess pricked my finger when I took it out of the packaging. The bottom drawer is so tight in the rails that it does not slide out without force. If I didn't need it, I would have sent this right back. But it does hold all my stuff and sits on a counter. Just hate that I can't easily slide the drawer, but I don't really need to at this point."
4,clutter buster,My daughter bought this in hopes of clearing the clutter on her bathroom sink area. It works! Hold lots of products and is attractive.
4,neat,This product is ideal for keeping items in the right places. It also fits in small spaces and because it is stackable it makes a big difference when retreiving you items.It's a must have for those who hates clutter.
3,Wish it was a bit sturdier,"This is meeting my needs, but it would be better if the bins were more secure in the 'track' that they slide on. If you pull the bin out too far it will just fall out. I do like that you have the option of securing it with screws OR putting the rubber feet on."
5,Treehouse Defender,"We had a robin's nest in our swingset treehouse for a good part of the summer. We watched the birds daily until they finally left the nest. After they left, I pressure washed all the poop out of there and bought this snake to scare away the birds. My two year old son moves it almost every day. He says, ""I moved the fake snake so the birdies think it's weal."" The robins haven't been back yet, so we're happy and my son can play on his swingset without being attacked. :-D"
2,Used in garden to scare birds,"I used this snake in the garden to scare away the birds, and as long as you move it around every few days, they do seem to avoid it. It is saving my fresh vegis from being eaten! I did not buy the item for use as a toy - but the review screen here seems only to ask questions about rating the item as a toy. It is a good quality material, and it is long enough to look like a real snake. It is a bit thin, especially through the head."
4,Works on a G4 Mac,"I purchased this for use on my G4 Mac (Digital Audio) so I could plug my 2G iPod nano into it. The card fit well into the computer, no fuss no muss. Didn't even need to put the CD into the disc drive, just plug and play. So far so good. When I tried to plug the iPod cable into it the computer wouldn't mount the iPod in iTunes, or on the desktop. Only place I can find it is in the System Profiler. Very wierd.Other than that the card works great, I have my printer plugged into it and it works very well.Perhaps I have not found a way to have the iPod work with it. Hopefully a way is out there."
5,My Fiancees belated gift for Christmas.,"got this for my fiancee and he just loves scary movie 2, just hilarious!!! thanks for delivering in timely fashion."
1,not happy with customer service,"Placed order for ""SCARY MOVIE TRIPLE PACK"" received ""SCREAM TRIPLE PACK"" instead. Was charged for order. Returned scream triple pack in exchange for scary movie triple pack. Was charged for order again. Paid twice for the same order, where's the customer service at?"
4,"Humorous, Serious look at TV Journalism","Sam Donaldson is both humorous and serious in this semi-autobiographical 1987 look at his job covering the Presidency. Donaldson is known as a dogged questioner disdainful of dodges and evasions. And as he shows that's his job, no matter how annoying he becomes to Presidents, other public figures, and the viewing public. Donaldson focuses primarily on Presidents Carter and Reagan. The Carter section is somewhat humorous; the section on Reagan would be even more so until you realize how out-of-touch the man was. Donaldson also examines the TV news business, the program THIS WEEK WITH DAVID BRINKLEY, his Texas upbringing, and lest you dismiss him as some liberal journalist, his vote for Goldwater in 1964. Ironically, for all his attack-dog persistence, he never gets very revealing about politicians, the news business, or himself. Still, this is an informative and humorous read."
3,I love Henry Products but that was not what was shipped,"I ordered this product from Amazon.com. It was shipped by a company called Rollstone. Henry makes good stuff. I have used Henry roofing material for years and have always been happy. This product is a rubber/plastic leak stopper. What I was sent was asphalt roof cement. NOT THE SAME THING, NOT THE SAME COMPANY. I ordered something I knew was good. They send me something else. I contacted Amazon and they contacted Rollstone who gave me a full refund. I am happy with the results. If you use any Henry products you will be happy with the result."
3,a few classics missing,"how can anybody say that murder the goverment is one of the best ever,especially when the next track on the album is ""monosyllabic girl""...which is a true classic,maybe it all boils down to politics."
1,this is not their greatest stuff,"If you think that this is nofx's compilation of best songs, then you are really missing out. Most of their best songs aren't even featured on this disk. If you want something great pick up counting sheep, so long and thanx for all the shoes, punk in drublic, and white trash 2 heebs and a bean. CHEERS."
3,Seams in Plastic Start to Show/Crack/Buckle,"Well, my 3 yo LOVES it and loves to sleep in it. However, we've had it less than 4 months and we just noticed the seams showing in the plastic. The seams look like ""cracks"" around the bed. My son weighs 35 lbs + a twin mattress, so it can't be a ""weight"" issue. I'll be contacting Step 2 to see if this a warrantty issue...maybe some kind of defect.Step Ahead has great customer service. I bought this directly through them for $350, not sure why B7B thinks they can charge $1k for it."
1,arrives late,i paid $125.00 for shipping and it was to be delivered by the 23rd at the latest and now i doubt it will even arrive before christmas.
5,Great looking and sturdy,"Its a really nice looking bed and very strong too. For me it took me a while to put the stickers on, but the rest of the installation didn't take very long. My son loves his bed and it also makes the room look really good. I am very happy I brought this wonderful convertible bed."
4,Not a toy ...it's a really nice bed for a 5-8 years old kid,"We had the small McQueen and we wanted to keep the kid's room colorful and cheerful. This is a nice, cheap, decent quality (could improve tightness of assembly) and ""joyful"" bed. the frame is slightly smaller than the same size McQueen and that's why we decided for this."
4,tired of shipping costs?,"I researched place to get this bed for over 2 days and called at least 35 places. Nobody stocked this bed, and most places could not get it. They almost force you to buy it online and pay outlandish shipping. I finally found a store 2 hours away that could order it for me at a price of 229 for the stock car and 249 for the lifestyle twin. If you live close to pittsburgh: Toy Heaven 814 371 2244. I even called the factory but they would not match their retailers price!! Good Luck"
3,Cheapest method of purchasing this bed,I found a site called MTM-Kidzstore atwww.mtm-kidzstore.com that sells the bed for $200.00 and ships it out for $80.00. This was the cheapest online store that I found. Good Luck in your purchase.
1,"Unreasonable Shipping, refuse to pay","We're so looking forward to get this convertible bed for our 2 year old boy but we refused to get it through online because the shipping is away too expensive, $165. It's almost the same cost as the bed. We hope Toysrus will carry them in store soon or they have internet promotion for free shipping on this item. Otherwise they will lose business....."
4,He loves his race car bed!,"This is a great bed! It looks so cute in his new nascar themed room. He plays in it all day! I would not reccomend using a toddler/crib matress in this bed, because there is a ""gutter"" (or large gaps)on all sides if you do. I have found my son in these ""gutters"" a few times a night, one night his head was on the race track! I had to add rolled up blankets and pillows to fill the gaps. Also, when you put it together, for a toddler bed the plywood they supply you with isn't the correct size. At least, we couldn't figure out how it was supposed to work! We used some of the cardboard from the box to make it work! Other than that it is a great bed. Just plan on using a twin matress insted of the toddler, and you'll avoid these problems."
5,Great bed!!,We bought this bed 3 years ago for our son who was turning 2 at the time. He loved and continues to love it. We started off with the toddler mattress until he turned 4 and then switched to a twin. He's 5 now and loves going to bed in it every night. It's durable and looks great! I especially love the high sides it has when using the toddler mattress. My son never fell off. I wish I could find a equivalent girl's bed!
5,Great bed,We bought this bed for our 2 yr old son about a month ago and his excitement level is the same. He is so enthusiastic while going to bed unlike the times before we had it.It is a very nice bed and I bought for 269$ including the shipping. It is very easy to assemble and is light in weight yet durable. It holds upto 300 lbs so one of us can lie down with my son till he goes to sleep as he is still getting used to it. Kids won't outgrow this since its a twin size that is 6 ft in length approx.I would definitely recommend this to others.
5,an adventure,I can't stop listening to this disc. Each song is so completely different from the next. The lyrics are amazing... I kind of feel like someone's been reading my journal.
5,I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!!,"Chris Mooney's stunning novel ""Remembering Sarah"" is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. It has all the essential elements of a well-written novel: an intricately woven plot full of twists, turns, and surprises; sympathetic, genuine characters, comic relief, and a great ending that leaves the reader with all our questions answered. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers that take you on a ride but have a bit more depth. I am looking forward to reading his earlier works including Deviant Ways."
4,A great read!,"I really enjoyed this book, I am an avid reader and this is one of the best books I've read lately. The characters were very well developed and the story line very realistic."
3,"Good, not great",This provolone is not as piccante as advertised. Provolone piccante ought to burn a hole in your tongue. Comparable to standard fare found in Rome.
3,is night vision binocular is available during WW2?,"I have read 4 of sven's books, well, basically they are good, but something bothers me tho. In monte casino, I think, major braun was stated as using his 'night vision binoculars', I thought these gadgets only available only recently, well, at least after WW2."
4,Great novel from the Gerrman View,"I was reading an Amazon forum recently on best war novels. One reader said simply ""Anything by Sven Hassel,"" whom I never even heard of before. Having been to Monte Cassino on a recent trip to Italy and being somewhat familiar with the battle that was fought there in 1944, I picked this book out first to read. I was not disappointed. Hassel writes with the experience of one who has been there. Good combat scenes, very realistic dialogue between the German infantrymen. After surviving on the Russian front the men in this squad are sent to Italy to defend the monastery of St. Benedict atop Monte Cassino from the advancing Allied troops. What a battle it turns into with the Allies resorting to B-17 strikes on the mountain in a desperate attempt to try and dislodge the dogged defenders who simply will not quit. Great first book by Hassel for me. Have ordered several more."
4,Excellent reading and research material,"While it is doubtful if Hassel actually served at Cassino (the Monastery was defended by decimated Parachute companies rather than Panzer crews) it is one of the best accounts of that battle available, and certainly calls into doubt the veracity of the accepted (Allied) histories.A must for any Hassel fan, this book brings an end to several of the known characters amoungst the usual rivetting detail and absurdities of war."
4,Monte Cassino -novel,Good gritty WWII novel about Monte Cassino. While does not cover entire battle gives good sense of the WWI type of fighting.
1,Not Impressed,"This 5"", plastic, barely transformable toy is nowhere near worth $30. I almost fell over when I opened the box. I have no idea who is really writing these other reviews, but what a let-down. Maybe someone will listen to this honest review."
3,A Fragile and Expensive Bit of Nostalgia,"Simply put, this is not a toy for children. I actually find it a little surprising that this was meant as a toy for children 20 years ago -- it's just not that durable.That said, this is a very good reproduction of the original toy, with all its features and flaws. There have been small updates to ensure it meets current safety standards, but it is more or less the same toy.If you are a bored 30-something with extra cash who wants to recapture a bit of his childhood, then this may appeal to you.If you are trying to find something for your nephew, you should look at the Transformers: Energon or Transformers: Universe lines."
4,The Book of Guinevere by ANDREA HOPKINS,"Most book sellers list this item incorrectly; the correct author is ANDREA HOPKINS. My copy (ISBN 0-517-14269-4) gives the publisher as CRESCENT BOOKS, a division of Random House. Hopkin's ""The Book of Guinevere: Legendary Queen of Camelot"" details the evolution of the figure of Guinevere through literary texts from the Middle Ages and Tennyson's Idylls of the King. The book is profusely illustrated by reproductions from medieval manuscript illuminations and nineteenth- and twentieth-century paintings and book illustrations. The book appears to have good through a number of reprintings; I think this is the first edition. Other editions include the following:The Book of Guinevere: Legendary queen of Camelot;The Book of Guinevere; andThe Book of Guinevere"
5,Mmmmm...,"I find Happle Apple to be an incredible Jazz CD. Although it does no justice to seeing them perform live, it is still a moving experience everytime I hear it. It just makes you move your head to the groove...and say ""Mmmm..."""
5,Wonderful,"Donovan is like a fine wine, getting better as he ages. This is a must have for any Donovan fan. I will probably wear it out, if you can do that to a DVD."
5,My dog loves these,"I have a heavy chewing Jack Russell terrier. She loves to bite pieces off of it and proudly presents the mess when done with it. Though these bones are not cheap, they entertain her very well and keep her from chewing on less desirable items around the house.Based on how big the chunks are, this bone will last between 2 weeks to a month. My dog ""accidentally"" swallowed some pieces of it without any effects on her health. Therefore, I would say that they are safe even for dogs that don't drop all pieces they chew off."
5,Love them!,I have 5 dogs and so we go through ALOT of chew toys and bones. I've always loved Nylabone products and Amazon usually has the cheapest prices.
5,The Stuff That Legends Are Made Of,"What a great package! Two of Peggy Lee's finest albums. The well known ballads--""As Time Goes By"", ""The Folks Who Live On The Hill"", ""Smile"", ""I Wish I Didn't Love You So"", etc. make up an incredibly fine selection. ""The Man I Love"" album conducted by Frank Sinatra, and ""If You Go"" conducted by Quincy Jones are sterling examples of musicianship at its best and sung exquisitely by one of the greatest singers of 20th century popular music. To paraphrase--in this world of ordinary singers,I'm glad there is Miss Peggy Lee. Definitely one of a kind! This collection is a must for any true music lover!"
4,A refreshing Buddhist approach to writing,"Somewhat coldly cerebral in a Zen Buddhist kind of way - and also because the author used little or no personal anecdotes. She and Natalie Goldberg are both Zen Buddhists and both teachers of writing, but otherwise they couldn't be more different: the strict introvert and the effusive extrovert. This book came across as more intellectual than most writing books and more interested in the psychology of creating rather than in giving you beginner's exercises (Goldberg) or in offering you an endless pep-talk (Julia Cameron). It had some unusual insights and I like its focus on writing as a spiritual practice, as a process through which you refine yourself, rather than pushing at us all to try to get published. Recommended!"
4,Good cover,"This is a good cover. It's not a perfect custom fit but it's much better than the discount store generic covers. I added two vented support poles and get a good snug fit on my Champion 155 SC. For good measure I also added a layer of extra fabric around the trolling motor. I don't use it as a travel cover, only to protect the boat since I don't have covered storage. I've only had it 6 months but the fabric and construction look good, I see no reason why it won't last several years."
1,Son's love made it worth it.,"Yes the wings fell off but with some super glue and an ingenious aunt that was quickly fixed. I too was disappinted but really, the look on his face when he opened it was well worth the money and any lingering disappointment I felt in my gut. I looked everywhere locally and you just can't find the buzz with wings anywhere but here for the price."
5,Buzz Lightyear is Fun...,"My little boy had an old junky Buzz Lightyear that we bought at a yard sale, so for Christmas we got the new one. We read the reviews that the wings fall off easily, which is true, but we just superglued them on, and that works great. It doesn't really affect the normal use of the toy. The sounds are fun and I would recommend this toy to anyone that loves Buzz."
4,"Kid loves it, what else do you need?","We got this on clearance after Christmas for $15. Worth it. I was able to balance Buzz on his feet with little difficulty. Buzz is pretty top heavy so you have to compensate for that by leaning him forward a little. His feet and knees do articulate a little stiffly, I think on purpose so he will hold a pose like standing up. His arms, elbows, wrists and even hands are posable!We also worried at first that the wings weren't meant to fall apart so easily, but I think this is a feature, not a bug. Our 5 year old has figured out how to put them back on pretty quickly. Now Woody has a buddy."
2,It's a Disney toy so it goes without saying not durable!,I am not suprised at all that the wings fall off extremely easy because it is a disney toy. Almost every disney toy i have purchased (and i have many) does not stay together as it should. My daughter loives it and plays with it without the wings but for once i would like a disney toy to stay together without crazy clue or some doctoring. Very hard to balance and make it stand.
3,It's Buzz...but beware!,"We love Buzz and this toy does say all the cool phrases, has a shooting red laser, the helmet shield can be opened and closed, and the wings pop in and out. However, the WINGS keep falling OFF! UGH! We just got this for Christmas and I'm already tired of putting the wings back on every 5 seconds! So, don't say you weren't warned of this problem! Other than that...it's a good toy....but I paid about $8.00 for it...NOT worth anymore than that."
5,Grandmas Take Notice,"My three year old grandson thinks this is the best toy, yet. This is a ""slam dunk"" gift for a young boy...preview it with ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story Two""."
2,the sand comes off,This is not quite what I thought it would be. The sand comes off. It's not see through so it obscures my cutting ruler measurements. It's small so it's not big of a deal.
1,Might be entertaining but not factual,It is amazing when someone writes a book how they can forget the facts about how something really happened. I wouldn't believe everything you read in this book because I can verify that some of it is definitely not true.
3,Enjoyable!,"this should have titled 'The R. Bolla Movie' - the guy has multiple sex scenes. Again the highlight here as with 'Blow-Dry' is the commentary, it's technically not 'hysterical' as Jerry Butler is only in one scene, and their banter is a tad juvenile, it's the third person in the background who is interjecting some interesting tidbits here and there - there's a whole audio deletion of a Marlon Brando story that seems like a jip, but all in all the conversation does leave you with a fondness for pre-2000 porn where everything was less clinical and not everyone looked like mannaequins."
2,Don't Be Fooled,This is NOT A WALL CLOCK!! It is a desk clock. The product info doesn't tell you the diameter. It is only about 5 inches in diameter. It's cute as a desk clock but I thought I was purchasing a Wall Clock as the description states.
5,Good gift,I am getting married soon and a friend suggested this book. I also purchased The Exemplary Husband for my fiance. We are both enjoying reading them together. Competitve price with all stores in my area and I received my order faster than expected.
1,God says you should make me a sandwich. Now.,"As Dostoevsky wrote, a gilded cage is still a cage.If you buy this dreck, I have an offer for you -- come work on my plantation picking cotton all day. There's no paycheck, but don't worry, you'll be provided for! Besides, slavery's in the Bible!"
1,A formerly abused wife,"My husband used to beat me, but thanks to this book and its righteous teaching of submission, I was able to repair my marriage and walk with the Lord. I understand that I owe obedience to God, and God has made me an help meet to my husband. I can only obey God by obeying my husband. God's will and my husband's will are the same. It worked, too. My husband no longer beats me. It is Jesus who is hitting me now."
4,Start with yourself,"I am still in the process of reading this book, and I find it challenging. After a spiritual renewal two years ago, I'm reading exclusively religious materials at this time. Parts of this book are difficult for me to grasp, but that's something the Lord is guiding me through. I think the most useful aspect of this book is if you want to change your relationship with your husband, you have to start within yourself. That sounds like common sense to me. Let us say prayers for those who don't understand this book, who find it offensive, etc... in the hope they will see things as God does, not as man does."
3,"It's hard to be ""the excellent wife""","I read this book to supplement a Bible study I was doing with a married lady while I was engaged. It was good for me to read, in that I realized that marriage is not always a ""walk in the park."" (When you're engaged, those rose-colored glasses tend to taint the potential hardships of marriage--you know, the ""love will keep us together"" mentality.) HOWEVER...I feel that the book was not written with much grace. Situations can arise that don't fall into her charts and categories--this causes you to feel less than ""excellent"" when you are unable to choose one of the routes she maps out for an excellent wife."
1,I wish I could give it a negative star,"I was recently married, and an in-law gave me ""The Excellent Wife"" as a present. I would have prefered a dish towel.My husband and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry as we read this book. ""The Excellent Wife"" is probably the most disturbing book written by a ""Christian"" that I have ever read. Martha Peace actually advocates that battered wives stay with their husbands who hurt them. She says that the correct thing to think when your husband hurts you is this: ""My husband may hurt me again. I hope not, but if he does, I will just have to let him and glorify the Lord."" What kind of advice is that? Women who are getting hurt by their husbands need to get out of the marriage!I was so disgusted by this patriarchal and mysogynistic book that I am going to throw it out! I was considering selling it on Ebay, and making $2 off it, but I don't want to be responsible for a battered woman reading this filth and deciding to stay with her abusive husband!"
2,"Christian ""Stepford Wives"" Unite!!!!!","Although Mrs. Peace had some fine Biblical principles in this book, I was very dissapointed and almost shocked with it. After reading through it, it gave the impression that it was trying to create ""Christian Stepford Wives"". Statements such as, ""consider his work (job, goals, hobbies, work for the Lord) as more important than your own"" left me scratching my head and trying to think about where in the world it said that in the Bible. There were a multitude of these references. My husband and I support each other in every area of life and we feel like this is truly what love is. Every time I have seen a woman give up every aspect of her self and devote herself 100% to her husband, there has been abuse on the husband's part. God made women to be unique individuals and yes, to be helpers and completers to their husbands - but they do not need to lose who God made them to be in process."
3,Has its good points..,"but some I question. I'm all for submission, but there are some exceptions...I think God will speak to our hearts about that though. I think the points she makes in this book will be a confirmation of what we already KNOW we SHOULD be doing but just needing a little nudge from someone (except our husband or moms or moms in laws!)."
1,Misinterpretation of Scripture,Author misinterprets Bible verses and leads the reader into a very legalistic view of God's design for women as wives and mothers. Poor sources used. Author uses her own personal opinion and writes it as Biblical truth; highly misleading for the reader and new Christian who is unfamiliar with how to read and interpret the Bible. Book is out-dated for the women of this current generation. Skip this book. There are many excellent books out there on being a wife who seeks the Lord's design for marriage.
1,Did you know that you can recycle books?,"I received this as a Christmas gift from my sister-in-law several years ago. In short...this book leaves me flabbergasted. The subtitle ""A Biblical Perspective"" is overstating things to say the least. Perhaps it's better subtitled - ""From Martha's personal interpretation of the Bible."" I held onto it for several years as I was unwilling to donate it and subject anyone else to Peace's point of view. My husband and I have had a good chuckle every now and then about the book. We both agreed that throwing it out seemed the best route...until I discovered that you can recycle books. I took of the covers, broke it in half, and put it in the bin. Perhaps the paper in its second life will be far more useful. Save your money...there are far better marriage books out there than this one!"
1,This is not a book you want you daughter to read.,"Be warned: This book is nothing but a fundamentalist attack on what healthy marriages should be. Martha Peace takes the women's movement back about 300 years with this archaic and literal interpretation of the Bible's view on marriage and a woman's place in that relationship.""Submit graciously"" is just the beginning here, folks. This book suggests a woman blindly follow her husband wherever that may lead her -- abuse, rape, unwanted motherhood. It is literal translations from the Bible like this that makes being a Christian hard to defend."
1,Offensive to the max.,"Just going to put it out there... this book is CREEPY. And really offensive to women. My sister got it as a wedding gift, and needless to say she threw it in the recycling after discovering the scum between the pages.Do. Not. Get. This. Book."
1,be VERY careful...,"This review is written by a Bible believing wife who believes in the biblical roles of the family. If you are a perfectionist, or have any emotional or sexual abuse in your past--please be extremely careful how you apply the recommendations in this book. It aims to help you be more like Christ in your relationship with your husband; but given human brokenness and sin by either party it can easily lead down the road of works based religion and extreme damage to your heart and your relationship. It is okay to speak up in your marriage. It is not healthy or okay, or even holy, to swallow every single thought that is slightly negative. The Lord gives us our instincts and brains for our own safekeeping. How I wish I had never ever ever been given this book--or felt motivated to follow it. Or had used it only in consultation with a *very* balanced counselor. Be aware."
5,Great for small groups!,"I am currenting using ""The Excellent Wife"" book and study guide with a small group of women. It is an excellent resource for helping women understand God's design for women in marriage. It is very biblically based. You won't find many stories in this book, rather author Martha Peace shares from her wisdom and experience as a Christian counselor the principles and scriptures that she has found most valuable in her counseling with women. I would encourage every church to include ""The Excellent Wife"" in their women's Bible study curriculum."
1,Don't Buy This Book!,"This is a book filled with the author's very strong personalopinions about marriage. It's filled with rules that will leaveyou depressed and under a cloud of condemnation. Well, I have good news! Galatians 5:1 says,""It is for freedom that Christ hasset us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.""It isn't Biblical to think we are made right with God by what we do or don't do (The Law) instead of by grace. (Read Galatians)If you are in the Word and in prayer, and are making it your life's goal to glorify God in all you do, trust the Holy Spirit to gently let you know when you need to change and become more Christ-like.If you want a good book about marriage and family, buy a copy of the book, Your Home A Place of Grace, by author Susan Hunt. That book is challenging, yet freeing at the same time."
1,Very warped and not biblical,"Let's just say that this is one woman twisting Scripture to suit her own worldview and then forcing that view on everyone else.If you disagree with her many misuses of Scripture, she calls you ""rebellious.""She doesn't believe that women are called to serve in leadership positions.I disagree with her on this issue. But, after reading her book, I am thinking women shouldn't author marriage counseling books if they are named Martha Peace."
2,Rejected,"What wife doesn't want to be an excellent one? I do, but I don't think this is the way to do it."
1,This book makes me sad.,"If this book represented every marriage, I would not get married. I have an equal partnership with my husband and that is the marriage I dreamed of. I feel protected, secure, and VALUED in my marriage... not as a caretaker or a slave, but as a partner.I received this book, it's companion book for husbands, a bible, and a crucifix as a wedding gift from my FIL's group of friends. I am sure they had the best of intentions with their gift, but you simply can't give these books to someone whose beliefs you aren't familiar with.I wrote this review solely to advise others to not purchase this book as a gift for a woman unless you know her values are consistent with what this book contains. It was very offensive to me."
1,I couldn't believe this book!,"I am just STUNNED at all the positive feedback this book has gotten. I was so disgusted by what I was reading I couldn't even finish it. The author puts down women who work, encourages wives to blindly do what their husbands tell them to do, and even tells women to stay in abusive relationships. If this is what marriage is, I can safely say I'm never getting married."
2,Horrible!,I received this book as a gift and was very uncomfortable reading it. I didn't appreciate the author stating that a wife should never want compliments from her husband. My primary love language is Words of Affirmation and compliments help me to feel valued and loved.The bible says that women should be submissive to their husband... but when is it EVER a good idea for anyone to stay in an abusive relationship!!??! I question the author's use of scripture and think she just piece-mealed the Word together to suit her own opinions. Don't read this book!
2,Not about the Proverbs 31 Excellent Wife,I was disappointed by this book. It seemed to be all about submissiveness and confronting your husband's sin. I was looking more for inspiration from the Proverbs 31 wife: How can I be an excellent wife who is industrious and looking well to all the ways of my household? This book just didn't deliver. Might be good if your husband is abusive or something like that.
2,Okay as a starting point,"This was not the first book that I have read on biblical submission and far from the best. I think it is a fine starting point (or even just intellectual background information) for women who are searching for God's plan in their marriage. However, Martha Peace is too heavy handed with with wife as the only one responsible for the marriage and heavy on the guilt. She is married to a Christian which I think distorts her view. Her methods CAN help all marriages, but I put down the book feeling ... put down. She has great ideas, but there are other MUCH better books out there if you are looking for a guide to biblical submission. And those books are more about being the best Christian you can be - which will lead naturally to being the best wife you can be."
5,The Excellent Wife was excellently written by a wife with a truly humble and excellent spirit.,"Knowing how much I adore being married and loving my husband, this book was given to me roughly 2 years ago by a woman I greatly trust, admire and respect. With EVERY intention to read it then, I did not. I did not ""get around"" to reading this book until just earlier this year (2010). This book TRULY was a book that Holy Spirit used to show me more, encourage me in the current and gave me a spirit to want to promote. The Excellent Wife is a personable, intimate, and humble teaching tool. I think Mrs. Peace did a wonderful job of allowing herself to be humbled and led by Holy Spirit to write this book. He's well pleased with her writing and so am I. I truly look forward to enjoying more writings from Mrs. Peace.Hats off to you Mrs. Peace! Well done! : )"
2,An Excellent wife can have an opinion.,"I found the book to be unrealistic at times, every marriage is different. Every wife is different. I have been married to my husband for 10 years and we have mutual submission to each other and we rely on each others strengths.This book says that you should agree with every thing your husband says except if he asks you to sin. I respect my husband as the head of the house hold because that is what the bible says, but every man needs a storng woman thats not gonna just agree to everything. I don't recommend this book for wives with husbands that are not following the Lord. Read the bible, pray and seek Godly counsel from real people."
3,Excellent Wife,"There are a lot of good points in here, but there were times that I felt like I was being lectured by my grandmother."
2,It's either love it or hate it,"It's the strangest thing. You will probably notice from the reviews that readers find themselves in two distinct camps: one group finds it refreshing, challenging, liberating, and practical; the other finds it narrow-minded, constraining, demeaning, and taking Scripture out of context. I am in the 2nd camp, but I am in the minority of my small group reading it, and the other women seem to love it. I feel like we're reading two different books! My advice: Take what truth you can find out of her suggestions, but based on the rest of what is written in the Bible, I do not believe that what she outlines is a Biblical model for how we are to act as wives. Read carefully, go back through the entire passages of Scripture where just she references the snippets. Do NOT simply swallow what she has to say as pure truth."
1,Not recommended,"I really struggled with this book because I didn't like it, and I wanted to make sure I wasn't just ignoring what I didn't want to hear. After some prayer, research, and a meeting with my pastor, I decided my first instinct was correct. Some of it is Biblical and helpful, and I certainly would not support an OPPOSITE view of this book, but there is enough wrong with it that I would not recommend it to anyone else. Martha makes a few good points, but I feel that her perspective is way off and so is her interpretation of Scripture. She seems to take a lot of verses out of context to support some kind of radical fundamentalist view. My pastor recommended a different book called ""What Paul Really Said About Women,"" by John Temple Bristow. I haven't finished it yet, but on first glance it seems to be more Biblical."
3,Nostalgia makes me write this review,"Being Italian I basically grew up on Baci Perugina. When I came to live in the US it was very difficult to find them and I sorely missed them.Now they are omnipresent and I don't miss them anymore. My knowledge and taste for chocolate has evolved since, so I find them too sweet and I can taste the vanillin (used instead of the more expensive vanilla). I would not buy a box for private consumption, or for a gift, but I do pick up one, once in a while, next to a shop chash register in memory of the time past.OK, but what are they?Each of them looks like a small truffle. The filling is gianduja chocolate (gianduja chocolate is milk chcolate with hazelnut powder mixed until it forms a paste. It is basically like Nutella, just denser), with small pieces of hazelnut and at least one full hazelnut on top. The whole thing is covered by dark chocolate.It looks like they are in fashion now, because I see them everywhere"
2,Could be better,"This book gives a very good description of what one can see along the trails but lacks information on intermediate trail access other than what the authors calls the 'Trailhead'. Perhaps some people want to start on the other end or in the middle but there is no description on how to get there. In this age of GPS units in almost every vehicle, GPS coordinates for trail access points are a necessity but none are listed. Some people run shuttles in order to do sections of trails only one way but there is no help, especially for folks that come from far away to ride these trails. The maps are adequate at best. The Office of Greenways & Trails brochures are much better in listing access directions."
5,Yes!! Florida's Paved Bike Trails is very motivating.,This book is most excellent. It gives wonderful descriptions of each trail and locations of trailheads. Best one I've found for Florida.
2,Am I missing something? Or is it Yes?,"I bought this DVD partly as a result of the extremely positive reviews here, but I have to admit that I'm very disappointed. I positively love Yes. I saw them live 3 times in the 1970s, but this doesn't sound like the band I knew. Yes combined technical proficiency with a hard rock ""wall of sound"" and passion. I hear no wall of sound and no passion here. It's like a classical string quartet performing Yes. It's like Yes turned into elevator music. Is it the absence of Rick Wakeman here? I noticed that visually the DVD focuses on Anderson, Howe, Squire, and White and not the two additional musicians. That's fine. But does the sound mix also leave them out and is that why this sounds hollow to me?"
3,Great visuals but where's the bass?,"Some YES fans will worship anything they do. I admit I love yes but I hate it when they put out something that looks great, is of a great performance and someone who didn't know YES mixed it. The bass is lacking on this DVD/Video. In addition, when they are showing Steve Howe play some of his best bits, you can't here him, or at least he is mixed way back. Its about as poor a mix as the DVD of ABWH. Lets hope the CD will sound better.But if you like yes you will like the visuals."
1,Disk Unrecognizable after 18 months,I have experienced the same problems with this disk as others who have written.... I purchased about 2 years ago... it played fine the two times I watched it... then I went to play it again the other night and it's not recognized by either my player or my computer - very strange as the disk doesn't have a scratch on it. Anybody else run in to this or have a solution?
5,THE GOOD,"Excellent live show that features some outstanding songs. Homeworld and Perpetual Change are awesome highlights. But, the real show stopper is the jaw-dropping rendition of Awaken- what a wonderful song and they do a great job performing this one. The Russian on keys is great- they should have kept him. Add this one to your collection."
1,technical problems with the disc,"Has anyone else had problems with this disc playing in their player? All of my DVDs work fine, except for this one. It is not scratched or anything. Unfortunately I don't have my receipt or I'd take it back. I'm just curious if anyone else had this problem. I want to know before I go and buy another copy."
3,psssss,"Yo he sido un gran fan de Yes hasta que escuché Tormato por primera vez, aunque no existiera ningún concierto completo de la banda grabado...hasta ahora. ""The House of Yes"" está perfectamente grabajo, tanto en terminos de claridad, mezcla de audio, brillo y presentación visual. Esta es tambien la única grabación oficial de Yes que incluye la formación de finales de los 90 formada por 6 músicos. con el guitarrista/vocalista Billy Sherwood, el cual sobra totalmente, mostrandose solamente en los nuevos temas que son bastante horribles, especialmente Lightening Striques. El nuevo teclista de la banda Igor Khoroshev pasa totalmente desapercibido. La lista de canciones es una inconsistente mezcla de los temas de siempre con una serie de blandenguerías más actuales, acompañado de los temas más rokeros que sepultaron el prestigio de Yes durante los 80 (Owner of a Lonely Heart, Cinema)"
1,This DVD sucks,"I know yes since 1975 and love the gruop, but the mix in this DVD is cold, sterile, the bass is buried and brutally compressed,. Iam sorry, but it is the sad true,Better get yessongs dvd, 900125 live dvd and the very good live in amsterdam dvd."
2,xincer,"IF your a Yes fan you will like this, but if you are just a fan of music with open tastes, this does not offer very much."
1,DEFECTIVE DISK,"I too am one of the unfortunates who can no longer play this disk in any of my DVD players. I've tried it in both of my stand-alone players, as well as the DVD trays in my desktop PCs and the player in my laptop. It won't play in any of them. The disk surface is perfectly clean and undamaged, and there is no damage whatsoever anywhere on the entire disk.In reading the reviews posted here by others who are having the same problems, it would seem that the company that manufactured these now-useless disks has gone out of business. Serves them right for producing such expensive, defective products.Hopefully YES will see to it that this disk is reissued by a quality manufacturer, and those of us who are stuck with these pieces of junk will be able to exchange them for free."
3,YES - it's good - why isn't the sound unbelievable,"YES you have to own this, if you're a Yes fan. Hope it opens doors to younger crowds/musiciansOne other critic ask why there is no bass - often true in this DVD, and who did the mix that gets lost at times? Not everyone was on shrooms during production, right? This could have been 5 stars!Does any fan out there know why Yes doesn't have a DTS audio or video release? Very strange for a band that performs/mixes in DTS. If we ever wanted to get close to the ""in the round"" music concept pioneered at thier concerts, why not 5.1 DTS?"
5,Second Best Only to Being There,"There are few concert videos that reach the perfection of the House of Blues. Other Yes concert videos have not even come close to the quality of this one. Finally! a Yes video that does not have all of that cartoon junk, or too many interview clips which has ruined many past attempts. KUDOS - You have finally hit the Jackpot with House of Blues. It's a video that captures the essence of a live Yes show. I hope that they find a way to produce something of this quality for the most recent Symphonic Tour. Although I will continue to go to the live shows for as long as they continue to tour, it is really nice to have the ability to relive the experience as often as I like."
2,Future History as a variation on the End of History genre,"In the U.S. of the late 20th century, a number of historians have turned to somewhat eclectic methods of interpreting the end of history or other variants on the notion of escaping or surpassing history. This is a particularly Americanized view of the world, or often Eurocentrist. Professor Wagar's book unfortunately falls into this category, and draws mainly on Eurocentric examples in his analysis of recent history, and his examples often lack rigor and fail to relate longer trends in state formation and authoritarianism as contributing factors to the mailaise of current crises."
2,outdated look into the future,"Reading this book ten years after it was written made it very hard to get into it. For one thing, the author still talks about the USSR and East Germany, and those countries faded away so long ago that the whole book seems dated. It's hard to suspend disbelief and imagine this book was really written far in the future."
4,Yumm!,"I've gone through so much of this giant bottle already! I love adding it to my instant Indonesian noodles, super delicious!"
4,Amazing new Early Vision Methodology!,"The book provide a brand new methodology and mature computational framework to solve early vision problems. It uses the tensor to convey the information and vote for each other based on tensor fields. After accumulating the votes on each input sites, it gives out the surface, curves and juctions all at once through feature extraction procedure. This method have found a lot of applications in motion analysis, stereo analysis, segmentation... So far, this book is the only book introducing this amazing new Tensor Voting methodology and software."
2,Thin and Insubstantial,"This album is a good try - it is serious and ambitious. Unfortunately, the atmospheric music adds up to very little of substance. There are many electronic and instrumental albums in my collection (Cocteau Twins, Anthony Phillips, Jean-Michel Jarre, Kraftwerk, many more), and Spirit of Eden just cannot compare to any of them. I bought this album after falling in love with TalkTalk's Colour of Spring, but I was quite disappointed. Perhaps I'm missing something... I see many positive reviews posted here. But I've given it many many tries, and I cannot recommend it.Colour of Spring is the true five-star TalkTalk album; if any shoppers are choosing between it and this one, I strongly suggest Colour of Spring. It is also progressive and conceptual, but it does not sacrifice coherence and power."
2,DE EVOLUTION OF TALK TALK,"Seems a lot of people think Talk Talk's later works are some kind of brilliant musical triumphs. Maybe to classical musicians or something but as far as I am concerned they started out as a rather run-of-the-mill synth pop group, evolved to make thier greatest work ""The Colour Of Spring"", then de-volved into a insipid, boring, lifeless band. Talk Talk- Music to slip into a coma to. This isn't quite as bad as ""Laughing Stock"" but close. Barely audible vocal mumblings pervade throughout. With the exception of the latter part of ""Desire"", I didn't find a pulse. Take heed all you newfangled Talk Talk fans, I understand for his next release, Mark Hollis is going to mumble some deep meaningful lines about life while farting in his bathtub."
5,Beautiful sonic journey from angst to peace - gimmickless.,"I picked a demo of this album up from a record store (an LP!!) in 1988, and was blown away. Lightyears from the keyboard-driven pop of their first few albums, this disc is a gorgeous drift through anger, reflection, hope and peace. Musically, it ranges from sparse to lush, with some abrupt transitions, and is constantly engaging. Not the disc to pop on to get pumped up, but one for reflection. Moving, beautiful, a must-have for those times when you're not in the mood for your usual choices. At times it soothes and at others you can almost feel Mark Hollis's frustration. New Age it AIN'T, but it's hard to classify - ""mellow"" is insufficient and misleading. It's challenging (though not in the manner that speedmetal or Zappa's Jazz From Hell is 'challenging'....) - it's a beautiful, richly evocative set of songs. ""Spirit"" in particular is superb. If your music collection is eclectic, you must hear this album."
5,JUST BUY IT!,"If my house was on fire and I could save only one object, it would be this cd. If I had to live forever alone in a deserted island, this would be the music I would take. Thank you for this beauty, Talk Talk."
5,I Believe in You,This album is so good I can hardly think of words to describe it. Thnk of every sound in your life that you love wrapped up in a warm blanket as you sit by a waterfall. Kind've like that.
3,nice but big,I bought it thinking Jr. would mean small for a small camera. it's not small. It is WAY too big for my compact digital camera. I will probably save it for a camcorder bag.
5,Natural Health Made Easy To Understand,"Lessons From The Miracle Doctors is nothing less than Excellent. It produces a simple, easy to understand plan for optimum nutrition for every system of the body as well as how nutrition can prevent, relieve and sometimes even reverse disease and illness. This book is a must for all concerned about their health and the health of their loved ones."
5,BUY THIS BOOK,"This is an amazing work and I agree with another reviewer that I would not want to lend it. I would however HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.Not only does Jon organize the material in a logical way, dealing with the various body systems and how and why they work as they do. He helps us stay above water with the myriad of conflicting information we get from the mainstream doctors and media.Another thing that is helpful is that Jon actually practices what he preaches and makes a high quality product available to aid us in our path to a healthy body."
2,nothing new,"the book is good, but does not have anything additional to add or offer to what is already out there and available to the public. secondly, it is simple a lead-in, if you will, to promote products and to make jon barron money.therefore, this book and his emails do not exactly rate high on my list."
5,Best Book in 35 Years,"I have been a Vegetarian for 35 years and over that period of time I have read hundreds of books related to alternate and allopathic medicine. If I had to recommend only ONE such book to someone this would be it. He writes in an extremely clear and convincing manner, and backs up what he says with convincing documentation. This book has changed how I will treat my body for the rest of my life."
1,The Ruinous Cadenza,"Having read about this recording in ""The Gramophone"" and ""Penguin"" Reviews, I was curious enough to buy an inexpensive, used copy. Fortunately my outlay was small enough to tolerate the disappointment. The moment that the first movement cadenza begins it's as if someone had changed the disc, so bizarre is the appearance of the piano and so disturbing is the violin transcription of the piano cadenza. This is not about traditonalists versus radicals; this is about aesthetic judgment. This performance is so ugly that it became impossible to hear the rest of the recording. The only reason I keep it is so that I can show someone how otherwise intelligent and sensitive people can occasionally produce garbage."
5,Defense of Kremer!,"Come on! We've all heard the rapturous concerto a million times. What that utter genius Kremer and the great Harnoncourt do to animate it back into those hidden recesses of the soul is OUTSTANDING.This recording, albeit I've everything Kremer ever recorded, made me hear the Violin Concerto for the first time.Why on earth can't we suddenly be listening to a piano in the midst of floating in the ether? Can't wait till this recording arrives. Kudos to Classical KUSC for featuring it today.And...may I remind the world to listen to all those composers Kremer has brought to us from the Baltic countries. His group, Kremeratica Baltica is one of the best in the entire world."
2,Kremer greater than Beethoven ?,"hum, to play cadenzas from piano version of this concert -on piano of course ! - here, it is very interesting and prettystupid idea, soloist's added own play in these cadenzas is also very original - and very long, he seems to like his play very much, but good heavens what does that chap play between the second and the third movement ?! simply said - MASTER does not play some Beethoven, but shows his own EGO."
1,underwhelmed,"It wasn't long enough. Also, the tape wasn't sticky enough so it fell off the wall within a day. I would not recommend."
1,FRENCH CD,I look after this cd for a long time please helps me to buy it. Mr SANDMAN by the chordettes or by the macguire sisters.
4,it's okay,"The book is okay. He states many things that are point blank obvious, but I'm not sure some people would notice or think of it. His voicing isn't my style."
5,helpful hints to weight control,"This book was not only enjoyable to read, but it wAs full of hints that worked for me. I understand about skipping meals, using the mirror over the scale and monotoring the fit of my clothes. Even though I have past middle age, I still have a slender figure thanks, in no small part to Mr Rives and his pragmatic advise"
1,Unbelieveably ignorant and misinformed...,"If I could have - I would have given this book ""0"" stars. I have never read a book on exercise to be so blatently filled with hateful and stereotypically bigoted remarks about fat people - not to mention erronious and misinformed. Obviously if the author [cared about overweight people], he would have researched and printed factual info (like the baloney about skipping breakfast being good for you... *sheesh*) and made an effort to help people of all sizes feel good about exercising and walking. Instead, he just added to the monumentally prejuducial treatment that fat people receive on a daily basis. Don't waist your money on this book, it is liable to just make you angry. It did however encourage me to walk - all the way out to the trash can to deposit this book!SHAME ON YOU, DAVID A. RIVES!"
1,FOREVER TERRIBLE SHOULD BE THE NAME!,"A COLLEAGUE OF MINE JUST WATCHED THIS FLICK HE RECEIVED FOR X-MAS...AND HE WAS SO ANGRY WITH HIS WIFE BUYING FOR HIM THAT THEY STARTED TO ARGUE...OH BOY. HE THREW IT IN THE GARBAGE, AND HIS WIFE CRIED BECAUSE SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW BAD THIS VIDEO WAS! YOU ARE RIGHT GUYS THAT THESE PEOPLE PUT OUT VIDEOS THAT THEY CALL FILMS, THEN IN FACT, THEY WERE NOT SHOT ON 35MM OR EVEN 16MM. I HAVE USED THE RED CAMERA ON 5 FEATURES, AND IT LOOKS PROFESSIONAL, BUT THESE VIDEOS GIVEN 5 STARS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED! THANKS FOR THE REVIEWS, AND YES, SOME OF THESE REVIEWS WERE FUNNY AS HELL!"
1,The Forever Dead,The misleading decal on the cover wants you to believe this movie could actually be good at something. I am a very forgiving movie watcher. I like most flicks other people hate. This movie is worse than bad. Do not buy this film.
1,I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this (kicks self),I absolutely love zombie movies and I have seen some real turkeys but this is a SERIOUSLY BAD MOVIE. I couldn't get through it and I've seen Zombie Nation =p. DO NOT BUY THIS!.
1,really bad movie,take your money and go make a homeless person dance for it that would be more worth it. ugggg really poorly done
5,Low budget gold.,"Low budget splatter films are always fun and this film is not exception. Great effects on the gore for such a low budget, acting was horrid but who cares no one is really on screen enough alive to matter. The Rabbit is another laughable but awesome effect that made this movie great. Get this one know to watch with a few beers and friends. Cool Zombies."
3,"it is good, but the shield is too small","the shield is too small,someone could easly get around it.it shakes wile you shoot. you are better off with a gun with a trigger."
3,A nice enough little story,"Maybe I was expecting too much from all the rave reviews, but Fup didn't quite do it for me. Yes, it was different and in places it was touching; Mr Dodge's use of language was clever and it elicited the odd wry smile, but that was it for me. Sorry, all you Fup fans out there!"
5,A book for almost everyone,"I found Fup in a thrift shop, it cost me less than a dollar. It was money well spent and I am gong to buy Jim Dodge's other books when I get the chance.Dodge's story about Fup, his friends Grandpa Jake and Tiny bought tears of sorrow and laughter to my eyes.Even Lockjaw the rampaging homicidal boar made me chuckle. It is an easy read I would recommend it most heartedly, especially if you're someone who likes to read when they are eating. Just be careful, you might choke on some of the funnier moments, but its worth every cough and splutter."
5,I READ EVERY DAY AND NEVER READ ANYTHING LIKE THIS!,"The first Jim Dodge book I ever read was ""Not Fade Away"" and it was the only book that made me laugh out loud while I was reading it. Fup continues Jim Dodge's literary genius and masterful gift. I've bought more Jim Dodge books for other people than I can count and gift giving never felt so good."
5,A Duck and Boar Story - & one of the best of its kind...,"And one of the best of its kind I ever read. Fup is a traditional American tall tale, truly a duck and boar story, - but with the flavor of Chaucerian fabliaux - as though Jim Dodge cross-bred the ""Nun's Priest's Tale"" with ""Old Yeller."" A domesticated twenty-pound hen mallard (that's a female duck, for those of you in the red states) battles her arch-enemy, a wild boar named Lockjaw. What's more, Fup can be read in about 60 minutes - it's the Anti-Proust!"
1,Very Different taste from the 'Made in UK' or 'Made in India' version.,The US made version of this Cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the UK version of the chocolate which I have been eating since childhood. I did not like this new taste. To all my friends from India -- buy this chocolate if it is either made in UK or India; otherwise you will be disappointed as I was.
1,A mil millas de distancia de la autenticidad,Ni en las recetas ni en los ingredientes...Una auténtica falta de respeto al verdadero taco !
3,"Shave is okay, quality is poor","I bought this shaver for my first electric razor after reading several reviews. I have overall been pleased with the shave (not as close as a regular razor, which was irritating my skin). However, the quality of this product leaves something to be desired. When my shaver arrived, the foil was already partially detached from it's frame. And, for whatever reason, the head of the shaver comes off more easily than the plastic guard over the blades and foil. I have to hold the head on every time I want to take the guard off to shave, or the foil off to clean the shaver. I even sometimes have to hold the head on while shaving. So... be warned. If you are willing to put up with this annoyance, then the shave is fine."
3,No deal,"I purchased this razor a year ago. I chose it for the style and price. It feels nice and holds a charge for a long time, but the head is very hard to remove to clean. The first time I took it off the foils came off. I glued them with super glue and it held till today and came apart again. While shaving the head feels sharp and scratches my legs. My other electric razors never felt that way. I would not buy another one."
4,Battery trimmer,"My wife has taken this Christmas gift on two trips, already. For quick work in any area of the body."
3,The damsel and her knight,"The movie was predictable like all other fairy tales. I knew in advance that the boy would get the girl in the end - like they always do. A little twist in the plot would have been welcome. It provided enjoyable, light entertainment on an otherwise boring afternoon."
3,"Good Movie, but watch the price",This is the second one I purchased. The first one was bought at the beginning of December and the second was purchased in the middle of the month. The price went up about 25% in 2 weeks. I recommend checking back often as the price seems to change frequently.
5,the best barbie movie ever,"For a barbie movie fan,I have to say this movie is excellent.I especially love the music.This is the best barbie movie ever!"
5,Tangled,Fun movie for the whole family. My husband even enjoyed it. Great picture quality! Amazon instant movies are easy to use.
5,Tangled 3D,"Very good product--3D is exceptional. Really didnt need the 4 discs,but it's OK.Received product in a timely manner."
5,Unexpectedly Hilarious!,"Ok - I'm a 43 year old, married female with no kids. My mother used to use me as an excuse to get HER into see animated films at the theatre, so you see the family heritage here. I have no kids to drag along, so I drag my husband instead. Felt that background was important to note.I was moderately interested in Tangled, and we ended up renting it on DVD. I thought for sure this would be a movie he wasn't particularly interested in, but he decided to give it a go with me. We both laughed until we cried. The next day I ordered my copy on Amazon. What a delightful, humorous twist on this classic story. If Emmys could go to animated characters (who are also non-human), the horse gets my vote. Yes, he acts more like a dog than a horse - just don't over-analyze and enjoy it! Great music, great villain in the ""mother"", and highly recommended as a great choice for family movie night."
5,Best 3D I've seen on blu ray,"I have to say, this movie has some of the best 3d I've seen on my 3dtv. It has a great combination of really feeling 3d, with bright visuals/colors, and still having some nice moments where you feel like you can touch something. Fun story, very family friendly, with great side characters (Pascal and Maximus rule). Can't recommend it enough. Even if you're afraid of disney princess movies, give it a shot."
5,OMG!!!,My kids love this movie!!!! and watch it everyday non-stop seriously like twice a day :) at must have in their kindle fire!!! Great picture!!! perfect !!
5,My daughter loves this in 3D!,This is one of the better 3D movies out at this time. Seems like the cartoon/animated flicks are much better in 3D than other movies. They seem to pop much more. My daughter just watched this in 3D for the 2nd time and she loves it. It's one of her favorite movies and she could probably be happy watching it everyday. The 3D effects are incredible. The only better 3D movie I have seen so far is Despicable Me. (from a 3D effect standpoint) I'm very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this movie!
5,My Favorite movie,"This is my absolute favorite disney movie! It's so happy, the music is great and it's hilarious! It's great for kids and adults alike and it's so beautifully animated! Great for fans of all disney movies ."
5,Best Movie Ever!!!!!,"tangled is amazing!the story of flynn and repunzel is a great comedy,adventure,and romance movie that is great for the whole family!the should create a sequel,tangled 2!"
5,Family fun!,"Great fun for everyone. An interesting revisit on the story we all heard as kids. I enjoyed the music, as did my 2 year old."
4,A Delightful Disney Tale,I loved the horse! It is a pretty retelling of the Repunzal Tale. I would recommend it to any child.
5,Tangled,This was a Christmas present for one of our granddaughters . Her original copy had been lost on a vacation trip when someone took part of the family's luggage as they were loading to come home. She was already familiar with the movie and dedlighted to receive it.
5,Great movie,"This movie is totally work buying and watching many times, especially if you have children. My husband adores this movie so its also great for adults too."
2,"Cheap, plastic.","This script was cheap and felt rushed. I was expecting just about every joke. The best part of this movie is the stepmother, who has great lines and great voice acting and a very expressive face. The lead character is so sheltered and ""young at heart"" that I'm made uncomfortable by the fact that suddenly she's thrust into a romantic situation. It's like watching a 7 year old fall in love.Also, clearly that horse is just a painfully unrealistic ripoff of Altivo. It was a eprfect example of the forced humor used throughout this movie."
3,Tangled,"wanted to cut her hair. The horse was great and so was the cameilion, but the acting dialog was a bit lame at times"
4,"Loved the movie, streaming not so much",We loved Tangled! It's another great Disney movie. Had some issues streaming from Amazon - sound was very low and the movie kept stopping to buffer... rather annoying issues. We often watch movies on the laptop and don't have such sound issues so I'm not sure what was going on here.
5,What a cute movie,"I was wanting to see this movie ever since I saw previews for it, and I'm glad that when i finally saw it its was on Blu ray because this movie is just so cute. I like that the story explains why her hair is never cut and why she is in a tower.. I don't remember the story so I'm not sure if its the same. I love the horse he was so cute and the cameleon. My daughter wanted to watch it over and over, it had a lot of signing but that's Disney and if you don't like the singing, well...... I would recommend this movie to any one it was just really cute!"
5,Yesss!,"At least a very good 3D,one of the best 3D effect i ever see and the packaging is magnificent with a 3D lenticular !"
5,Wonderful Disney Princess Movie,My 3-year-old daughter loves this movie. She had to watch this everyday for 2 weeks after we got it.
4,"Great, but no bonus features","We love this movie! The DVD is great, but there aren't any bonus features other than commentary on the making of the movie."
3,Mixed Messages,"It's about a girl whose mother for 18 years dies and she runs off with a thief and lives happily ever after with the king and queen.The movie is brilliantly produced, but the story is a little flawed. Your mother for 18 years falls off the tower and dies, and you don't even shed a tear. I'm not sure what sort of message Disney is trying to portray with this one, but thieves are better than mothers .. hmmmm!"
2,Tangled (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo),The description said TWO disc Blu-ray/DVD combo. There was only ONE Blu-ray disc in the case. Not even the slip cover was included! COMPLETE SHAM! I DID NOT GET WHAT WAS DESCRIBED!!!
3,Haven't I seen this story before?,"This movie has more than a few passing resemblances to Disney's Beauty and the Beast. The ending is almost identical. One thing it doesn't share is the music. The songs here are bland and forgettable. And what's with those oversized eyes? They were a bit creepy. Not a horrible movie, but Disney seem to be getting a little lazy with their material."
3,Just an average animated movie.,"Just an average animated movie. I guess i expected to much from this movie and got just an animation.I liked the lantern concept and how it was used into the story.This animation doesnt really pull you in,it wasnt amazing it was just an ok animation.I guess i havent watched to many disney movies.I guess i didnt expect it to be a musical. Even for a musical/animation the song choices were ehh.I mean really, I think there could of been better music/song choices.But I guess am comparing it to much to some really great ones like ""The Jungle Book"" or pixar's ""Up"".To me it was just another animation to pass the time.""Average"".Not to extravagant and not to cheap."
1,my review,I just got the movie today I have been waiting for so long to get the movie. When I put it in my DVD player it did not work. I am so mad that I have to wait to ship it back and get a new one.
1,not happy,i rented movie because my grandkids just love this movie. but they were disappointed cause it will not show on my computer on the first day of rental when my grandkids were there and then the next day it was showing when they were gone. i will not be renting any more dvds.
2,3D technology still not good,"No complaints about the movie itself as it was for my daughter, but this is about the 5th 3D blu-ray I've gotten through Amazon that chapters of my BRAND NEW FRESH OUT OF THE WRAPPER blu-ray skips or freezes causing us to miss between 5-10 minutes of the whole movie. This was a poor attempt at 3D by disney (as are many I'm finding regardless of producer)that there might be 1 or 2 points where the 3D actually works and they are quite intentional such as a spear pointing straight at you. I guess I expected movies to be much better at this point, 2 years + out from Avatar (blue people, not the awful movie version of the cartoon from Nickelodean), but not many movies have made the effort. I'm still buying 3D movies sporadically if it is a movie I want to keep regardless if 3D works or not, but I would by alot more 3D blu-ray if they would make an effort to create a true 3D experience."
5,Great Value,"Great value! I didn't realize it was a 3D DVD but we kept it anyway because it also includes the Bluray, DVD and digital copy - Amazin! Arrived in time for Christmas and we're very happy with the product!"
5,our daughter loves this,"Even though my daughter is 19 years old, she asked for this movie for Christmas this year. She couldn't wait to watch it, even though she's seen it on tv many times."
5,Tangled,"The kids love this movie! The parents say it's one of Disney's best! I would give it a four myself, but I'm just grandma."
5,good cartoon,"got it for my wife, she's just a kid at hart,loved the movie,would tell anyone with kids or that is a kid at hart to get it !!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! YOU MUST SEE!!!,My daughter age 6 and I went to see Tangled in theaters (regular version).We liked it so much we also saw it in 3D a week later. We laughed and cried through out the movie. One of my top 5 for Disney!
5,Fun for all,"Tangled is a fun movie for all, both boys and girls and parents too. It is a kid's action comedy, with very funny dialogue and situations, but it has a nice story with a classic feel and a modern twist to some themes. It's also a musical to some degree as the characters break out into song a number of times. In the end it's a great combination that makes for a movie that everyone can enjoy. The voice actors are flawless, and the character named Maximus steals every scene he's in by using classic Looney Tunes moves. There's also at least one scene that's gorgeous to look at. Overall an excellent kids movie."
5,Great movie,"Very enjoyable movie. The singing was engaging and the dialogue was very witty. My kids loved this movie. Even my husband liked it if that is a recommendation! The ending was a bit scary and may be too much for very small viewers. My daughter saw this when she was just turning 5 and she was fine but she has nerves of steel and nothing bothers her. The ending is eventually happy but for a few minutes there my husband and I sat there in horror thinking our kids might be traumatized for life. Luckily, it all worked out well and parents may want to see this first so they can explain what is happening in the end. This isn't like when Bambi's mother dies off screen. The rest of the movie is great though and it is definitely worth watching."
5,A good purchase,I was delighted with the purchase of this movie. Not to mention the movie is all so heart warming and a great story for the little ones.
5,Best Disney Movie in Years,"I was so pleasantly surprised when I saw this movie in theaters. It captured my heart so much that I went back and saw it a second time the same week! It's charming, funny, heartwarming, and absolutely entertaining. The Disney magic from the good old days of Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast is finally back, with music that is reminiscent of those old favorites. Perhaps what I loved most was the character development of Flynn and Rapunzel- they're characters with unique, fresh personalities that aren't predictable, and Rapunzel presents a fantastic new representation of the Disney princess, one that's confident, brave, smart, and doesn't need anyone to save her. At the same time though, she's completely lovable, with a personality that's very humble, unlike many movies where the strong female character is completely stuck-up. Buy this movie: you won't regret it!"
5,Combo Pack,My daughter loves this movie and she watches it all the time. Glad I was able to finally purchase the movie. I'll be highly upset if the price goes down on the movie.
5,Fast service,he movie came quickly and in time for Christmas Day. Tangled is a fun movie with great characters and my granddaughters love it.
5,LOVE this movie!,Tangled is one of my daughter's favorite movies - to get it with the Digital Copy gives her the ability to watch it on her iPad!
3,so-so,"what was the rave about this movie? I expected so much from it and thought that it would give me a ""wow"" effect. Turns out it is just an OK animated movie, especially i didn't expect it to be a musical and the song choices were so so. Even though I do like the lantern concept that was used in the story, i was never very into it throughout the movie. It's not bad, i guess, but it wont be a classic.."
4,Good But Now Quite Pixar Quality,"This was good, and our kids enjoyed it, but as an adult, it lacked the extra spark of Pixar movies or even some of the earlier Disney movies like Aladdin. Some of the songs and jokes seemed tired and contrived, and the stepmother was a little too scary and creepy for my taste."
2,No dvd extras! Almost.,"Not even a commentary on the dvd. I'm really disapointed.There is no 3d presentation on dvd, only on the blu-ray...You have to have a blue-ray reader to be able to watch the special features...I liked the movie very much, though..."
5,Rapunzel Redone,"This version of Rapunzel is so cute, entertaining and funny. You have to see it to believe it. We saw it at the theatre and had to have the DVD. It will be a new classic."
4,Fun for Young and Old,"I watched with my mom and son so there were 3 generations who thoroughly enjoyed this movie, we had a great time, it was funny and entertaining."
5,Well made,"I loved this music, it was great for kids and good for adults too, it was well made and a nice feel-good movie."
3,Scratched DVD,The DVD was brand new but was very badly scratched when we opened it. It skipped a few seconds and froze twice towards the beginning of the movie. Besides that the quality was good.
4,Fantastic !! The one-star reviewers are mentally ill,Great movie. No harm will come to your children if they see this film.Those one-star people are nuts.
5,Great transaction,"The movie arrived very quickly in great condition, it was missing one of the paper inserts and the seller immediately sent that to me as well. The movie is in great condition and my daughter watches it all the time. Thank you so much for an awesome transaction!"
4,Its okay......,"My kids where more exited about the idea of the movie then before they watched it. After watching it they haven't asked to see it again. If you have a portable player, in your car or on your lap make sure you get the DVD- Blu-Ray combo."
4,tangled blu ray 3D,"LOVE IT !!! ITS SO BRILLIANT BUT ONLY ONE PROBLEM, THE DIGITAL DISC IN THE PACK DOES NOT WORK HERE IN NEWZEALAND SO I AM UNABLE TO PUT IT ON MY iPOD.. WHICH WAS ANNOYING. THERE NEEDED TO SOMETHING WRITTEN ON THE DVD BEFORE I BROUGHT IT THAT THE DIGITAL DISC WOULD BE ZONED TO THE US AND CANADA ONLYTHANKS NIC"
4,Tangled DVD,"Received quickly, disc 2 of Blue Ray DVD set, was not plainly labeled as such on website, other than that, disc was fine."
5,Rapunzel,The best movie ever according to my grandaughter. And by letting her watch it on the Kindle I don't have to watch it 100 times over and over!
5,Great movie,"My 2 year old loves watching this ""pincess movie"" and asks for it at least once a day. We love the convenience of the instant video app on my ipad so she can watch a movie when we drive to visit her grandparents 3 hours away."
4,"pretend the last 10 yrs of disney didnt happen, it's back to ariel/aladdin","i'm a big fan of the old school disney movies like robin hood, aladdin, the little mermaid etc, so the past 10 yrs or so of disney movies have been very disappointing for me. tangled, was a breath of fresh air. it's finding nemo/up humor mixed with disney princesses. i thoroughly enjoyed it. i'd heard bad things about the movie when it was changed from ""repunzel"" to ""tangled"" but i disagree. i think it was a good mix of a more humorous aladdin (character) for flynn and repunzel is an ariel mixed with a boo from monster's inc. : )"
5,So adorable!!!,My daughter loves this movie. We saw it in theaters. I would total recommend this for anyone that has a little princess in their house.
5,Top 3 Disney Movie!,"My whole family LOVES this movie. That includes my princess-loving 4 year old and my all-boy 6 year old...and even my husband and I. The story is great with plenty of action for boys and princessy fun for girls, the songs are great (we even bought the soundtrack), and it isn't too scary or upsetting for kids. I get sick of ""kids"" movies that are scary or inappropriate and this one is neither (though there are some tense/loud moments...but nothing that was upsetting for my kids). It's a GREAT movie...get it!"
4,Tangled - worth watching.,"When there is so much trash out there, it's always good to have no buyer's remorse. Not only I'm I glad I watched it, I'm glad I own it on DVD.I can't say it's a ""must"" since no single song really impressed me as a break away hit, but they were all O.K. The animation and the story were excellent - no obvious stupidity or plot holes (unless you dislike hyper intelligence in a horse, but this is a fairytale).This was a thoroughly enjoyable film for the family and better than most and I'd recommend buying it."
5,Daughter loved this movie,Purchased this DVD for daughter's 11th birthday and she loved the movie. She's played it several times already. Received on time and without problems.
5,A pleasant surprise.,"I guess over the years I've gotten really spoiled by Pixar.With the exception of the Shrek movies I tend to shy away from other animated movies.I was curious enough to rent Tangled since it was based on a Bro's. Grimm story.I was hoping Disney would do the story justice and...they did.Excellent characters, they all developed at a fast and interesting pace.Excellent story telling.Direction, art, animation were all beautifully done.The one thing I really don't like about old Disney films is the constant singing.That's probably why I like the Pixar movies better but thankfully Disney toned down the singing this time around with more humor.Heck even the songs themselves were funny.I loved this movie and will be buying the 3D version.Highly recommended."
5,Still Thinking About This Movie,"Taking my 12 & 14 year old daughters to see this movie Thanksgiving Day, I had no expectations due to what I feel was inadequate promotional material.But after having seen it, I am still blown away by just how fantastic this movie was!! It was funny, heartwarming and a beautiful love story. The music was incredible and the laughs just kept on coming! At no point was I bored and the scene out on the lake at night was simply breathtaking! I'm surprised that I am saying this, but I cannot wait to see Tangled again!Marvelous job!! You guys knocked it out of the park!"
4,Big Hit,Enjoyed by my teenage grandchildren who would ordinarily disdain such fare. Beautifully rendered. A positive Lasssiter production of superb craftsmanship.
5,Unmatched for 3d Animation,"When I say unmatched animation I mean the characters move and emote more beautifully and expressively than in any other 3d animated film. This film was originally directed by Glenn Keane, the master animator who drew Tarzan, Aladdin and the Beast, and his superior animation knowledge really shows in the movements of all these characters.This is also a very well-made, funny film. My wife, my 7- year old son and I all loved it.I don't like having to buy a 4-disc combo to get 3d, but the 3d is well-done and convincing. So I'd say the price is high, but it's worthwhile to watch."
4,A cute retelling,"This movie was very cute. I was bored, and since I've always loved fairy tales I decided to rent it online. I was glad that I did."
5,WOW!! Absolutely LOVED it!!,"Tangled is amazing, really enjoyed it. Picture quality is unreal. It's for all ages young or old you will fall for the story and stay in love for long. It actually had some twists I didn't expect. Truly one of the best, thank you Disney for another worthy and amazing animated film!!"
5,Great Movie I cannot wait to get it.,"I love this movie i waited so long for the release of the DVD so that we can watch it over and over again. great story. i cannot wait, go Disney go."
5,So insanely well done,"I work hard at getting over the story line all the time as it's rather twisted and demented. However, My daughter doesn't know that yet and she enjoys it very much. As do my husband and I."
5,My Favorite Movie to Watch in 3D,"I love this movie. It is funny, warm and engaging. The production could easily be staged on Broadway. The music is just that great, in my humble opinion. 3D enhances the movie and does not distract. I would recommend it as a starter movie when you first buy your 3D set. It is fun for all ages. When I saw it in the theater, a baby about two laughed her little head off at various scenes. Adults laughed at different scenes, but everyone found something wonderful about it. You will not regret buying it."
5,Gift for My Daughter,My daughter is a huge Disney Movie Fan... and she's 17!!! She loves Tangled and especially Ryder. Can't go wrong with this one.
4,Super cute movie -- with really lame bonus features on Blu-Ray,"Tangled is a really nice, wonderful movie which both kids and adults will enjoy. I was, however, disappointed with the bonus features on the blu-ray disc. Very few, short, and not at all interesting or informative. A first for Disney movies as far as I can tell."
5,They took a story we know and made it better!,"I really thought this was going to be a boring re-interpretation of a story we had heard so many times before....SO wrong! This was an amazing colorful and fun adventure that my child has enjoyed countless times, but I have looked forward to watching as well.....I know this doesn't make sense... I hate cartoons...but this one is BEARABLE. The story line maps with what we all know, but adds interesting twists and takes you where you never thought it would...YEAH!"
2,Ripped Case,"I bought this as a present for my little sister and she was thrilled to watch it right away. But I was disappointed with the movie case because the plastic was torn on the bottom of the case. The movie quality is fine so I won't be returning it, but I was sad the case was ruined."
1,Beware if you want to watch in 3D!,"I have nothing bad to say about Tangled, the movie. It's excellent. Don't take my 1 star review meaning that the movie is bad because it isn't--it's totally cute and worth watching.But don't purchase this combo pack if you think you can watch the 3D version on a regular television. The 3D version is ONLY viewable with a 3D TV coupled with a 3D Blu-Ray Player. It does not come with glasses to watch on a regular HD TV.I think this pack should come with a warning about this. Yes, there is a regular Blu-Ray, regular DVD, and a digital copy included, so a person can definitely watch the movie. Just not in 3D"
1,"Love the movie, but it won't play in my blu-ray players","I purchased this movie a while ago and just recently opened it. I was surprised to find out that it wouldn't play in my Vizio Blu-ray player. I tried several times, but it would actually lock up my player. I sent it back and was quickly sent a replacement. I tried that one on two different blu-ray players and the same thing happened. i went to the internet and found out that a lot of people are having the same problem with this movie. I think it is crazy that Disney would put out a movie that doesn't play on most people's Vizio and Samsung blu-ray players. All Disney suggests is that you update the firmware on your machine. Well mine says it is updated, yet I still can't play the movie. So, I will return this one too and just purchase the regular version which does play. But, I really wanted the blu-ray version."
1,BOO,The mother who steals Rapunzel stabs the boyfriend-And they show it. Not appropriate for children. Poor message overall.
3,What you would expect,"Just your average animated Disney musical. Not amazing, but not bad, it was good entertainment for the plane ride I had to take."
3,"Okay, but not a Classic","This fun and updated version of the fairy tale was enjoyable, but not worth a second viewing. There were moments, such as the ""I Have a Dream"" song in the tavern among the brutish rabble, that were funny and enjoyable. But none of this animated feature achieved the level of ""The Little Mermaid"" or ""Beauty and the Beast.""Worth a watch, but not a second viewing."
