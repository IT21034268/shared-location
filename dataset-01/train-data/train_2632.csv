1,Don't waste your money,"Our daughter received this toy for Christmas, then she was 9 months old. She tried and tried to do things on it and finally gave up and ended up sitting on it to make the music. Back then she would get excited for the music when sitting on it....now she doesn't play with it at all. She loves her big brothers magna doodle."
2,Not as great as it sounds,"The music on the toy is great and I like the volume control option, so I bought this toy for my 9 month old last Christmas. He was not interested in the toy, so I thought maybe he was too young. Now he is 18 months old, and the only interest he has in it is stepping on it. He has almost broken the stand off the back and has lost all of the stampers on the front. If you want my advice, consider the vast assortment of other toddler products before buying this one."
2,recommended age is 9 months??? should be 2 years,I bought this toy for my daughter for christmas and she is now 11 months old and still can't play with it by herself. My 2 year old daughter sits and plays with her younger sister and the baby just gets bored doing nothing and crawls away. I can't believe they actual recommend this for 9 months because my 11 month old still can't play with it by herself. the screen doesn't always completely clear and the shapes fall out and can get lost easily. I would not recommend buying this for a younger child bu maybe for 2 and up they might enjoy it.
2,Not a good toy,"I recieved this as a gift for my daughter and she does not like it at all. When you ""write"" on it you have to move the bar up and down several times to get it to erase what is on the pad. Even after doing that it sometimes remains...I would not suggest purchasing this toy."
2,Not very entertaining,My 15 month old daughter received this for a gift one month ago and hasn't touched it yet. The age on the box is a little younger than what it should be. I am disappointed because I thought she would like it but all she does is walk on it which triggers the music button and that she likes. Once the music stops she walks away. It's difficult to erase the drawings and not at all fun for even a 15 mth old.
1,Terrible,My daughter got this for christmas well we got it out of the box and she didn't think anything of it until she heard the music well to get it to play she sit on it cause she can't get her little fingers hard enough to make it play. On top of that the little pieces that come with it well we left them on there cause we didn't think she would be able to play with them yet and I believe we are right This toy was a huge disappointment to me Fisher Price this was not a good idea I am just hoping one of these days she can use this thing by herself cause it is just too much for a 1 year old.
3,Okay,"We had one of these for my daughter four years ago and that one seemed better made. This one, it is very hard to erase the drawings, you really have to push down hard. Same with using the shapes on it, you have to exert a lot of pressure. Buy them a magna doodle or aqua doodle instead, they will have more fun with it."
2,Couldn't keep my daughters attention at any age!,"I gave this to my daughter when she was about 15 months and even though I tried to work with her, she just wasn't interested at all. So, after a while, I put it away and brought it out again at 19 months and have had it out for the last 2 months. She still is not interested in this toy at all. It was a waste of money!"
2,"Hard to ""paint"" on",My daughter received this as a present when she was a year old and only played with it a few times. She liked the music though and would press the musical note on the side to here the music. Its to hard for a one year old to press on and make an impression even using the tools that came with it. My 4 year old can paint on it though.
2,Not what I expected from a toy for babies,"I was very excited when my daughter received this toy for Christmas, but I got the complete opposite reaction from her. Most of the time, it stays in her toy box. When she does decide to take it out, she steps on it because that is really the only way that she can put an impression on it. She does, however, like the fun music that it plays."
3,A Pre-Review,"Well, this is going to be a Christmas present for our 21-month-old daughter, and while I can't truly ""review"" it, I offer this to parents of developmentally delayed and/or visually impaired toddlers...I think that the musical component of this toy is FANTASTIC. We are trying to get our daughter to really be comfortable using her hands (she has a fairly severe visual impairment and the resulting delays), and I'm hoping that the musical feedback will encourage her to pat and scratch the ""canvas""...thus creating a self-fulfilling cycle. There are little shape blocks you can use to draw with, and I'm thinking she will probably like exploring these even if she doesn't use them in the intended manner. When I tested the music at the store, it didn't seem too irritating or loud, so I'll keep my fingers crossed :)"
1,Not a good buy,"I bought this toy for my 1 year old son last Christmas. The tools that it comes with do not work, the only way to draw on it is to use your fingers but once you get a drawing on there the roller does not clear it off. It does play music but there are a lot of other musical toys out there that are a lot more fun."
2,"Nice concept, but not a very kid friendly toy.","I bought this for my 2 year old quadruplets..they played with it alot at first and then became tired with it fairly quickly. It was not easy to make pictures on the screen, and they had to push down with their fingers pretty hard. When trying to erase the screen so they could make a new picture, we had to slide it back and forth over and over again and still did not have the screen totally cleared. My older son has always had a magna doodle and I thought that this would be good for the younger ones but after seeing how much my kids didn't enjoy it, I ended up throwing it away and buying them a small magna doodle as well."
1,A toy enthusiast,This is one of the worst toys I have ever purchased. I must admit I thought it looked interesting in the photo but you have to press very hard to make anything appear and then the roller bar doesn't clear the screen in less than 5 swipes. My 9 month old and two year old are totally bored with this toy. I do not recommend.
4,Stand does not work,"I thought this would be a really cute toy for our one year old, however, she can't play with it for more than 5 minutes without it collapsing. The stand does not hold at all, even when ""locked"" into place. Forget about our 2 1/2 year old playing with her, as soon as he tries to use one of the little shapes and presses it against the toy, it collapses. I thought it would be one of our daughter's favorite 1st birthday presents, but it was a huge bust........"
2,HATED IT!,I was excited to get this toy for my 6 month old last christmas. He was not too interested in it and neither was my 2 year old. It's hard to make an impression - I had trouble with it so you can imagine my kids.I put it away until recently - hoping my now 1year old would enjoy it. NOPE! My older son tries to step on it to make an impression of his foot and guess what - that does not work either.Don't waste your money!
1,Do not Buy,"This toy is very disappointing. I bought this toy about 2 years ago. My son had no interest in it then and still doesn't at 3 yrs. old. 5 stars for durability, but that's the problem. It is to tough. You need brut strength to draw anything and then remove it. Caution - do not buy."
2,Long lasting because we don't use it!!,"I hate to say this about a Fisher-Price toy, but this was not worth the money. I was excited at the idea, but after having purchased it, it does not live up to the description. It's very hard to draw anything recognizable on it. You have to press hard, so the music is always playing and that gets annoying. Most of the time it just sits and collects dust in the corner. My daughter plays with her magna doodle so much more.The only reason I gave it 5 stars for durability is because it's never used so it will last forever!!"
5,Children With Special Needs,My five-year-old son loves this toy. His writing skills are delayed because he has Autism and doesn't like to color or write but is mesmerized by this toy and will make lines and shapes because he loves the squishy surface and music. His Occupational Therapist says it is wonderful for developing his finger strength as well!
1,Purchase was a mistake,"Our experience with this parallels many of the other reviews. Our 10-month old daughter has enjoyed chewing on the little shapes/drawing instruments but has had little other use for it. Interesting concept, but as a eraseable drawing toy for toddlers, forget it. My kid has strong hands and a pretty good attention span for a 10-month old, but there is no way she's going to be able to draw and play with this toy as intended. Don't waste your money."
3,Took my son 3 months to be bored by this,"Not very durable, didn't take my toddler long to break off the plastic stand that goes in the back. (Like an hour).When it plays music it gets his attention but other than that he is easily bored by it. Not worth the price!He does still play with the 4 geometric pieces though."
4,"Fun, but for 15 months or older","My daughter got this for her first birthday. She loved the way the ""paint"" felt and loved the music. But she kept pinching her fingers under the roll bar! Ouch!"
2,wish i had waited,"i bought this for my son the first christmas it was out. we have never really used it because it needs so much pressure to move the gel stuff. I quickly came to hate the music, as my son and our two cats were constantly stepping on it. I put it away hoping that we'd enjoy it later. not likely to happen. even now that he's 3 1/2 it's difficult for him to create a picture. it's not easy for me, either."
1,Waste of money,"This toy plays fun calypso music, but that's the only good thing about it. You have to press really hard to ""fingerpaint"" on the screen, and my toddlers were not able to do it. They played with the shapes that accompanied the toy, but would just ignore the rest of it."
1,not as fun as it looks,"I thought my 17 month old twins would love squishing their hands and fingers on this ""painting"" a picture. The most fun they have is stepping on it to make the music go on. And the plastic shapes included to draw with fall out and end up in the bottom of the toy box. Also their fingers have gotten pinched when they slide the bar across that erases the picture. Mine did not come with a stand, which they probably wouldn't have used anyway. Try a magnadoodle instead, my kids love using the ""pen"" and scribble away."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my son last year when he was 1 1/2....certainly not what I had hoped for. Once he pressed once of the shapes onto the paint screen, it was there for good. The eraser did not clear the screen. He only played with it a few times."
2,Finger Painting Flop,"I love the concept of this toy, but the reality is a big dissappointment. Babies can't really draw or paint anything on the screen, and the stamps that are meant to make designs, etc. are ineffective. Even Mom has a tough time making anything resembling a drawing on this toy. As a big Fisher Price fan, I was let down by this toy."
2,don't bother,"nice concept, but doesn't work. The little tools don't work on the gel. baby likes to suck on the little tools and they keep getting lost. The music starts to grate as well. Also, the easel stand was missing on mine."
3,I didn't like it as much as Mom did,"Mom thought this was soo cool! I do enjoy it, as do my older brothers (2 and 5). Mostly I like to play with the shapes and sit on it and listen to the music play. Mom is worried that the plastic holding the ""paint"" in might break...but so far so good."
2,Eraser Bar,"We got this for our son for Christmas, at that time he was 9 months old. It's a neat toy, but should be for an older child. Our son has gotten his fingers stuck in the little eraser bar as that's his favorite part of the toy. There needs to be less clearance between these moving parts."
3,Fun Musical Toy,"We got this for our one year old daughter for her birthday. She doesn't really care too much about it but her 3 yr. old brother loves it! He loves to play the music and draw on it. It is a neat little toy, but maybe it is better suited for an older child."
3,ok toy,My daughter received this as a Christmas present. It doesn't hold her attention that well. She pushes on the board to hear the music play but doesn't really draw on it.
2,Daughter X-mas Gift,"Takes a lot of pressure to show ""paint"", 10 mnth old daughter wasn't really interested in this. only thing she seemed to like was that it plays music."
3,fisher price fingerpaint,"My 22 month old granddaughter seems to enjoy it, however you have to press down pretty hard on it to make the music work so it needs to be redesigned. I give it a 5 out of 10."
3,need stronger fingers,"love the design and how the toy works, but practically speaking, kids have to push pretty hard to draw with her fingers, a bit unrealistic for toddlers"
3,OK but not great,"Found seat to be quite hard and uncomfortable for longer rides. Changed to Specialized Phenom SL 143"" and much better."
4,Healthy Vegan Quick Lunch,"This soup is another great addition to add to your pantry when you did not have time to cook something or leftovers have thus run-out. The soup does have a distinct barley flavor with lots of nice sized veggie pieces. Not too watery but deff not a thick, stick to the back of your spoon kind of soup. As far as nutrition goes, there are two cups to each can, per serving is 70 calories, 1 gram fat, 13 grams fiber 50% RDA of Vitamin A and 20% RDA of Vitamin C. I usually eat a salad with any of Amy's soup just to make sure i am not hungry by 3:30, but with all the fiber in this soup that might not be in issue. I was very pleased with this soup and do plan to get again. For all us vegans out there this is a good way to get in some good nutrients while being fast and delicious."
2,Earth Mother,"The flavor is good, but the soup is quite thin. It needs more barley and chunkier vegetables. It is barely more than a broth, which makes it expensive."
2,Bland,"This soup isn't flavorful at all. It needs more salt, more vegetables..everything. It's edible but not enjoyable. I much prefer the Amy's Chunky Vegetable kind."
5,Vegan Organic Choice,"Vegan. Organic. Low fat. Medium consistency. Not super thick and not watery. Very enjoyable. Nice vegetable barley flavor with a prominent garlic flavor note. Great low cal, low fat choice. Approx. 140 kcal, 4g protein, and 2g fat per can. Also really likeAmy's Organic Chunky Vegetable Soup, 14.3 Ounces (Pack of 12)andAmy's Organic Minestrone Soup, 14.1-Ounce Can (Pack of 12). This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out ""Vegan Grocery Favorites"" and ""Vegan Grocery Top Ten"" in Listmania. Your ""helpful"" votes count and will be greatly appreciated to benefit the search of others."
5,"Very Low calorie, tasty soup","I like this soup, and on it's own - it's probably not enough for anyone as lunch because you'll be hungry an hour or so later.I have it with a few slices of whole grain bread generally, and that makes it a meal for me. Perfectly tasty on its own though - so great for a snack."
5,"Tastes homemade, low cal yet filling","This along with another Amy's soup are the best tasting canned soups I've tasted. I thought it would be more calories with the barley, but is only 140 calories per can, compared to the Healthy Choice vegetable soup I'd been eating which was 200 calories a can, and not as healthy ingredient-wise.I'm dieting, and before trying this soup I'd have some whole grain bread with soup, to make it filling and like a meal...yet this soup is filling without bread, because of the barley, so that cuts down even more on calories.Another thing, the vegetables are minced quite small, which means that every spoonful is DELICIOUS, as so many flavors fit into each spoonful!"
1,NO Thank you.,"Illustrations are very boring and look nothing like a cat much less the cat breed. Buy ""Legacy of the Cat"" instead."
1,why buy this when you can get all ten seasons and get every show,i don't understand why anyone would want to buy these sets when you can buy all the seasons for just a little more money!!!!!
1,Creative Motion LED clock,"This clock is very attractive, as it gives a lovely glow in a dark room. However, the 2nd hand stopped moving after 3 months, so the clock does not keep the correct time."
1,A complete waste of money.,"Tells you to get a wool blanket to keep warm. Shows him greasing a truck. Tells you the advantages of eating food out of a can. Nothing about getting loads, getting paid etc. So bad it is actually comedy...."
5,Good purchase,"The video came quickly, on time for Christmas and was just as advertised. My son was very happy with the DVD set and it plays well."
5,Boy Meets World: Sixth Season,"I was a bit iffy to purchase anything online.Since I've had a bad experienced with an online purchase before.I heard about Amazon and decided to give it a try.It's great and I love my new boy meets world DVD.I have been a fan of boy meets world ever since I saw it on Disney Channel years ago.I knew I had to collect all the series.In this series, Shawn Hunter (also known as Rider Strong) does some powerful acting.I love to watch him along with the others on their college journey.I received the DVD no later than the date specified and the tracking device was a helpful tool too.I would definitely buy from here again!"
3,It's an old favorite,My children really enjoyed watching this when it aired on tv. Now they enjoy watching it without commercials. It's silly humor with some good lessons attached.
5,The greatest tv show of all time,"Ive watched boy meets world ever since it was on the air. In a normal,regular sitcom, it shows some jokes that are a little funny, mediocre, or just boring(example:everybody loves raymond, the king of queens), but there isn't going to be as special as Boy Meets World. Every joke is hilarious and its very smart how it continues throughout each episode suprisingly. The cast is amazing and the story and script is phenomenal. Every other stupid, modern teen show(icarly,hannah montana,big time rush) cant compete towards a show which isn't annoying or random. Boy Meets Word is the best show that could ever premiere on television. Every episode is a masterpiece and i highly recommend watching this show for anyone."
5,FABULOUS!,I love this product! I was so glad that I bought this TV season and am pleased with the condition it was sent in.
4,English Crewel Designs Sixteenth to Eighteenth Centuries,"Like Ms. Bradbury's other fine 8.5 X 11"" softback book, this effort is well worth the price. Inside the front cover offers a brief credential of Ms. Bradbury which satisfies the knowledge of the reader knowing that the author is a specialist in her field.A four page introduction on the history of needlework during this time period helps set the reader to the correct time frame. The bibliography she used is impressive on its own right.The patterns are easy to trace due to the dark and broad ink lines of the pieces. The patterns are also comfortably large so the reader can copy the design and color it to get an idea of the piec prior to stitching the pattern.Again, however, the patterns are not referenced as to the actual textile it is copied from. But rest assured, the patterns in the book are from actual pieces and not the author's interpretation of the actual piece."
2,Classic Patterns and Designs - ONLY,"May be considered a ""duh"" statement considering the title but having minimal experience with crewel work I didn't quite know what to expect. The lines in the patterns are very bold which will be helpful with tracing but makes the small details of the patterns appear chunky. I do like the floral designs as they represent what I had envisioned and I will use some of these - but I would have liked some suggestion of what stitches would work on a few of the designs. Perhaps this speaks more of me being a novice with regard to crewel work - If the reader is looking for any type of instruction or suggestion of stitches - you will not find that sort of thing here. This is exactly what the title says it is - DESIGNS only. I'm still satisfied with my purchase though."
1,Misleading and poor design,"I am very interested in English historical embroidery, and purchased this book with excited expectation. The book does not have any designs from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the modern designs created out of her own head by the author are not reminiscent of the period she claims to be illustrating, nor are they very usable as patterns. There are egregious misstatements in the historical notes. I am very sorry I spent money on this book."
4,Crewel designs,All the designs are black line drawings (good for tracing!) with some indication of stitches. If you go on the Internet you can find free books for downloading that have lots of similar pictures for free. It is nice though to have them in one book. I am not sorry I bought the book!Anna
2,Mediocre Music & Animation,"First off I have to say this it is a crime to compare this movie in any way to Ghost in the Shell. At some points, the animation can seem fluid and smooth. For the most part, however, it is blocky and rushed. Especially in the really important parts, with the android, the body parts are rigid and the motion choppy. The music? Eh, mediocre at best. Typical rock/electro with dreamy female vocals. Ths story has been done SO many times, it is sad. Man creates android, android questions existence, blah blah blah. The original Ghost in the Shell movie did it best.I guess if you must see it for yourself, then go ahead. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY IT. $20 for a 35 minute movie? If you think that's a good deal, then go ahead my friend."
3,I love these shoes,"They are gorgeous, sexy and eye-catching! But the cutting is small so you need to get a size bigger and the straps can cut into your skin if its a tad too tight. I would love to buy another pair if I could get it in black again and a 1/2 size bigger!"
5,Perfect color for the season,This was a last minute purchase but end up being the perfect pair. I hesitate in the beginning because of the luminated heels but it end up working just fine. It fit comfortably and the color match my dress perfectly. So glad I bought it.
4,Great show,This is a collection of some favorite shows. My sister really loved this show and I bought this as a gift for her for Christmas but I can't resist it either. Really enjoyable and a great buy.
3,....unnecessarily and excruciatingly verbose!,"Although his work on valuation techniques is straightforward in later chapters, the 1st several chapters do not do an adequate job of explaining the psychology of business valuation, buying or selling or the 'intangible' of business value. Words such as 'steeds' and 'pestilence' belong in literature, not reference manuals. Are Cliff Notes available to decipher just what these chapters are trying to communicate? I am trying to buy a business;lots of hard work lay ahead. Why must this book start off so unclear?"
2,good conceptual overview,"Good overview of valuation concepts, but if you want to sit down and actually come up with a number, try ""Unlocking the Value of Your Business""."
1,not a very good book. A much better book on subject is...,"This seems to be a fairly narrow treatment - not very helpful, nor easy to read. A much better book is ""Unlocking the Value of Your Business."""
1,Beware! There are no replacements parts available!,"The ""unbreakable"" carafe has cracked and is not usable. I cannot find a replacement. First, I called Villa Ware and they told me that they do not stock parts. I then called all the retailers that they suggested, plus sellers on Amazon who offer this model and could find NO replacement parts. What to do?"
2,"So, so blender","I have only had this blender now for a year and the polycarbonate carafe has been cracked for over half the time I owned it. Very disappointing. I bought this item from Williams Sonoma and they will take it back however, because they no longer sell this item in the store they are only willing to give me the last known price in the store which of course was on sale. It was a good blender however, my vitamix blows this blender away and cannot compete."
1,$100 down the drain,"VillaWare NDVLCB0100-SHP 600-Watt BlenderI would have given this 5 stars because it's a great blender BUT after we broke the carafe, I found out that I cannot replace it. I had to throw away a six month old, $100 blender. Stop selling this. Do not buy!"
2,Kind of Disappointing,"Although I am a huge fan of Channel Zero, I was pretty disappointed in Public Domain. Although it's got some cool development information about CZ in it, this book really lacks in original artwork, and doesn't offer much in material that went unseen in the CZ books.If you're a rampant Brian Wood fan as I am, this book is worth having in your collection, to complete it if nothing else. If you don't meet that criteria, you might want to skip this one."
1,"Not Easy to Use, Difficult to See.","On paper this device seems great. I had a simple use of random dictation while driving my car. Unfortunately, the software is difficult to use and the screen fonts are impossibly tiny. I am busy. Just give me a simple interface and I am happy. I'll be looking at the Olympus models."
4,Pioneering,"This is a landmark book and is worth reading because it is important. It argues against the popularly accepted view that the human mind is like a computer and puts forward the embodied, emergent and socially influenced perspectives. Once everyone figures out what these words mean there will be a revolution in our ability to understand our minds.Most of the papers in the book are well written. There are a couple near the end that are poorly written.Freeman is a pioneer and Nunez is a revolutionary (see his work with Lakoff - ""Where Mathematics Comes From."")"
4,Recipes Galore!,"This is a handy sized cookbook with tons of recipes. Definately more than what you would expect for its size. Recipes are of the heathly variety with yogurt, fruits, and granolas as main staples of the recipes. The recipes are easy to follow, and come out well. They also give great ideas on presentation to help with the pickey eaters. If you are into health foods, and making sure your young one gets plenty of the natural foods this is the book you want to pick up."
1,boring,a great man brought low by very mediocre analysis and the kind of slavish academic tone that seprates writers from ivory tower hacks - reesman and labor - when's your masterpiece due any way mate? Get a life like London and don't waste us fans of LOndon's time. I got stuck with the tab this time.
2,*Ink,We thought we purchasing a 2 pack by the picture. It was only one (1).Could have bought two cheaper.
2,"a dry, scientific text","This isn't a book geared toward the general population. The material is well-documented, but not written in a way that captures the readers' attention. It is very dry."
3,"Fun to play with, a little harder to master","I am not a guitar player. I like the EZ-EG because I can fool around with it and not worry about tuning, breaking strings and scratching it. The strings are pretty thick and don't strum as easy as a real guitar. The different sounds are diverse enough, but many sound more like a keyboard than a guitar.I really have a hard time making my fingers match the lighted chords. They don't start with easy ones and many chords are just plain impossible for me to do with my apparently short fingers. I wish they had some easier chords to start off with.I downloaded the free songs and they are fun to strum along with. Its really just a toy for me, as I don't have enough time to take real lessons. I have a very nice Acoustic Guitar but I have never been able to get it tuned properly, even by some Pro's. This is a nice compromise, and it has a volume control.Batteries don't last long and the AC adapter cord is short - get some rechargable batteries."
4,Excellent Knife,"Very sharp, very very cool. I love this knife. It is exactly what I wanted. It's a Case, and Case is known for being a high-quality American made knife. That's exactly what I got. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because after about 3 months the blade has a few rust spots. No big deal, it can be cleaned (I don't clean my knife often enough), but I figured the blade would not lose it's luster so quickly."
3,A tight fit for Genz pack,This case does hold the Genz but barely. The front flap can't close completely and it should be made larger.
3,nothing complicated,"This is a 4""x5 3/4"" journal filled with lined pages. Light and convienient. It's a good size for a dream journal, memo book or travel log."
3,Cute but just OK,"This book is cute, but the price was supposed to be a ""sale"" and it is the price listed on the back. It's a very small book, not much use for actual journaling. But cute for a very small gift."
1,Fraud or Mistake???,"The item he sent me was 0.42 OZ ID Juicy Lube Passion Fruit, which is supposed to be 1.9OZ. I don't if its a fraud or mistake."
5,scrapbooking organizer,"I use this box for organizing my photos for a scrapbooking class. Have these in several colors, one for each album I am working on."
3,Not the best,This soccer ball has been owned for close to a year. It doesn't hold it's air well. Not the best quality.
5,Tundra..,"Even though this was filmsed in 1938, it was stil very enjoyable. Considering Alfred Delcambre.. screen name Del Cambre is my uncle had a little to do with it. I now have teh remake from 1949 and I am going to watch it soon. Some triva.The studio offered my uncle two hundred dollars to come out to Ca. from Dalls Tx to put it in his own voice. He declined even though that was a lot of money back then."
2,How can you jump to a particular story?,"Apparently, there is no way, at least no obvious way of going directly to a story you are interested in. The Table of Contents can be found by selecting the ""beginning"", then moving back a page. But to get to any of those stories listed, it seems you would have to ""turn"" page after page until you get there. Do you know of another way? What a nuisance! Well, I guess you get what you pay for...This is a free book so I suppose we're not supposed to complain. But I am, anyway."
5,Great book for the Kindle,"Short Stories Old and New is a great download for my Kindle. Even though I have read every one of the stories it is so much fun to go back and reread them on my Kindle. These are classic stories by my favorit authors and it is a pleasure to have them handy to read over and over. If you like the classic short stories, you will love this book. The Short Stories are:1. Esther - from Old Testament2. Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves3. Rip Van Winkle - Washington Irving4. The Gold-bug - Edgar Allan Poe5. A Christmas Carol - Charles Dickens6. The Great Stone Face - Nathaniel Hawthorne7. Rab & His Friends - Dr. John Brown8. The Outcasts of Poker Flat - Bret Harte9. Markheim - Robert Louis Stevenson10. The Necklace - Guy de Maupassant11. The Man Who Would Be King - Rudyard Kipling12. The Gift of the Magi - O. Henry"
3,Disappointed,"The absence of a table of contents is a problem, requiring the shuffling through the pages to find what stories are included and where they begin and end."
2,Kindle edition outdated.,"I'm greatly disappointed that the Kindle version of this book is the Third Edition, some eight years out of date. The Fourth Edition, printed in 2007, is much more current (but still needs updating).Star Ware is a great book, but the Kindle lagging behind turns out to be a waste of money. NOT recommended--there is some misleading info in this edition."
1,I learned to be more careful in the future from this book.,"To at least remain constructive, the main learning point from the experience this book brought me as a reference is to check multiple references when making a large purchase, if multiple sources say something is good then there should be much less likelihood of purchasing a lemon. In 2005 I used this book as a single point of reference for a large buy and it didn't turn out well. More recent purchases have been more thoroughly checked and I've been much happier since. For example seeing a particular piece of gear featured in an astronomy magazine (sky and telescope) article or equipment review is a good sign. If you wonder why I am making this review in 2013, seven years and some months later, obviously I was pretty disappointed with the advice this book gave."
3,Good techincal stuff - but out dated information,The book is well written and good reference foramateur astronomers but it needs updated version.There are many new and better equipments out therethan being referenced in this book.
2,It really [stinks],"This game is one of the worst games I've played. It has [bad] graphics, it's slow, not realistic, and boring. You see, I bought this game and I still regret it. How realistic is it when you follow little orange dots? In this game, the game animals have little flourescant red dots on them, so you can go run up to them and shoot them. And, how about the X-ray mode? How many hunters run through the woods with an X-ray machine? How about the penalty system? You immediatly get a fine from the warden(somehow, he manages to just pop up when you blast a squirrel. And sometimes if you wound a bear, it'll run away. You also have a health meter. If you stand in the woods too long, you apparently just die. Please, people, this is a new game. The creaters didn't put any effort into it. Save your money, you're better off waiting for a different hunting game to come out."
5,This Chump Stain reaks of Awsomeness,I really enjoyed blowing away the many creatures in this game!!! Not only was I able to kill big game but I was able to shoot small woodland creatures as well and that made me very happy!!! I really liked to shoot squirels and rabbits as well as geese. If you like to kill things but not in real life this is the game for you. Even if you don't like hunting you'll love this game.
3,More of the same,I was disappointed with this CD. The artists are not breaking new ground or even creating new music. The songs in this CD are from a live performance and they are almost repeats of their earlier CD Ghazals. The quality of recording is also not high. I was obviously taken in by all the other raving reviews.
5,One of the best,"This is a fabulous book. I first read it when I was 15 and picked it up and read it again 30 years later and it was just as magical as the first time. The characters are well developed and their growth believable. The ending is particularly poignant and has stayed with me for years. This book is a must for any fantasy lover, but is also recommended for those who just love a good story."
5,Serbian Chetnik heroes,"Michael Lees had a unique prespective on the wars which raged in former Yugoslavia in WWII. As a British SOE officer assigned to work with the Serbian Chetnik guerillas, he witnessed first hand their military efforts at disrupting German supply lines and in attacking large German units. He builds a convincing case, now proven by official British historians, that the British were duped by Communist moles in SOE to switch their support to Tito and his Communist Partisans - bitter foes of the Chetniks. Lees attacks what he calls the ""received wisdom"" which for years stated that Chetniks eventually ""collaborated"". In fact, Lees meticulous research of formerly classified British and American documents concludes the exact opposite. A tremendous contribution to a poorly understood theatre of World War II."
1,ARK II; The Bad Tv show.....,"I'm clueless as to how anyone can treat a show that was supposed to take place after World War III, that three geeks in some armored car can rebuild mamkind after a devestation war. The nuclear fallout would keep the Earth lifeless for millions of years before radiation levels would fall enough that life could get started again. Oh yeah, that's brains, and brains was something this show did not have."
4,Performed as expected,"Since I had not viewed this program since my teens, in the age before stereo t.v., and Hi-Def, I was only slightly dis-appointed, with the Audio, until I remembered that this show came BEFORE stereo. The video was atleast as good as I remembered, although, on d.v.d., you can HEAR more than you could, on broadcast t.v. The episodes were in good condition, and I consider this to have been a GREAT investment, for my video collection.Now, if I could only find the classic (chuck jones) road runner cartoons, on d.v.d., I would be very happy!If Road Runner is in as good of shape as ARK 2, it would be a great investment, as well."
5,Ark II: The Complete Series,"WOW memories flood back when this one was aired in Australia in the late 70'sThis is one of the series make me into the sci-fi addict I am happily am today, Poor effects, sloppy acting and hunky actors. What more can you want?.A top series in my book. Glad It became avaliable on dvd"
3,completely sentimental,"For those that are nostalgic. it's just like all those shows we thought were cool as kids, but now see the strings on the TARDIS etc. fun addition to the scifi collection."
1,So bad I'm watching it for the humor effect,"This instant watch video is soooo bad and low budget that I'm watching it for the humor effect alone, and I've never done that. We'll see how far I get. So far I'm into 8 minutes :)"
4,I Figured You Out,"'I Figured You Out' written and played by Elliott Smith may be one of Elliott's best ever. And with Mary Lou's breathy vocals, the song is pure honey. I'd recommend this EP on the basis of this one track."
4,"Great price, very functional","My only qualm with this dog house is that in the rain, water would collect in the bottom. I just drilled a couple of small drain holes at the corners and that problem was solved."
5,Chucky loves his house!,"My 90 lb. pitbull Chucky, a foster dog, loves this doghouse. I will find him outside laying in it even though he has freedom to come in thru his doggy door. I have to beg him to leave it and come sleep in the house at night, and sometimes he prefers to stay in it. It is sturdy, very very inexpensive compared to others, and extra roomy, with lots of space for air circulation. I just tossed a thin cushion into it and he loves laying in there. Best money spent in years."
1,Caused hives.,"Add this to my list of ""rash-causing cleansers.""This made my face break out in hives. I have no known allergies to Olive Oil or Aloe, so I'm guessing it's either the quality of oil, or the fragrance.Bummer! I really need to find an affordable solution to my sensitive, dry-skinned face!"
2,"Nice looking, but not well designed.","This cage looked like one I had in the past, but there are several design flaws. Number one is the doors. The top tier sets too low and the food tray doors only open part way. Also, the cage itself is very fragile, and unstable when assembled. I kept this cage only because of the hassle it would be to return."
1,Warehouse Deals does not deliver as expected!,"First of all, I assume the product is grate but I never received it. So this rating is about Warehouse Deals and not about the product itself.I bought it refurbished to save another 400USD. Warehouse Deals sold me that 233d in a refurbished box with everything in it but WITHOUT THE CAMERA! There was no replacement possible and no other option available to me other the return. Right now I'm waiting for my refund with Amazon and if completed I will not get a refurbished product again."
1,sloppy soccer,"game looks good-until you play it a while...gameplay slows down in panoramic viewconsists of passing to unseen players...then you cannot control your player until the ball lands (usually to a defender).very rushed feel, a big disappointment. hopefully, Konami will release ISS2 for Gamecube...EA's offering here is a rip off."
4,It's OK,"Not much new here, graphics are good. If you like soccer and do not have another game, this would be the one to buy"
4,"Ok, just a few problems","FIFA is a great soccer title compared to the cartoon version, Soccer Slam. This is a game with easy controls to remember, Over 10 leagues and divisons and over 150 teams to choose from!Another plus is the detail on every player! The only problems are that there too many championships to go through, unless you like to take ur time with games. This game takes up too much memory on a 59 memory card, unless you have a 251 which, you'll be fine. Last, problem the setting this game starts on is too easy. I won 15 to 0 on my first game. This game is a totally a keeper for you if your a die hard soccer fan!"
2,Poor performace,"Facial color was poor no matter what I adjusted.Aspect ratio was incorrect in some modes. For example with a high definition picture the aspect ratio was 16:7.5 instead of the correct 16:9. When ""Wide"" was selected the aspect ratio changed to 16:10 still not correct.The TV is advertized as being HDTV although there is no mention of HDTV in the manual or on the box. The box contains the words High Resolution. The quality with HD signals is not very good.The instructions in the manual to do the necessary scan for stations is hidden on page 22. Should be up front considering this is one of the first things to do.Unit is being returned for refund."
2,oh my somehow its goods and i cant like it more,well its pretty neat how things happen and stuff. theres ghosts probably in that story cartoon. and i watch it with cheetos on my lap. i was scared sometimes when monsters were around so i turned the volume low. i like it when i have a glass of juice and i dont spill it a lot. thanks for being.
2,"I'm a big JM & NE fan, but...","I must admit, this is a rather strange film -- sort of like Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy meet Lewis Carroll. :-) It is not one of my favorites of their films, but (a) it is nice to watch them take a chance with a non-formulaic approach, and (b) it is nice to watch Jeanette and Nelson in pretty much anything. Their charm and chemistry always shine through, no matter what the story; however, if you are unfamiliar with their work, I would not recommend ""I Married an Angel"" for your introduction. (For newbies, I would recommend ""Maytime"" or ""Naughty Marietta."") Regarding the DVD itself, the quality of the film transfer is excellent -- the movie looks bright, sharp, and clear. For diehard JM & NE fans, I'd say this is a valuable addition to your DVD library."
3,A little dissapointed,"I've been a Nelson Eddy, Jeanette MacDonald fan for most of my life. I went to all their movies when I was a kid. I used to collect milk bottles for their deposit in The Bronx (.03) so that I could go to the movies. This movie, i believe their last together, did not have the same verve that the others seemed to have. To me it was like the producers just used their names to sell a show."
1,movie,Glad that i was able to see this last movie of the team. Bad movie shame they went away from what made them famous and tried something different.
2,I Married An Angle.,"Thought this movie was way below their true form and a little boring as well, though not knocking them for they are a great performing couple, just this movie however did not at all grab me. I own everyone of their movies that they did together, and so love watching them over and over again, however not this one. Barbara. Australia."
3,good album but my least favorite PR album,"This album is a good album, don't get me wrong...I love the Pissing Razors but this has to be my least favorite album from them. I see why they titled their album Evolution because they were experimenting with a few new styles but it's hard to evolve as a band when you can never keep the same members, it makes it harder that way. I'll still headbang to this album for sure, and im sure it will grow on me eventually but their earlier albums were their best! pick em all up!"
5,big book of latin american songs,"It's a great book. I'd gotten a copy and given it to my dad, but I liked it so much I ordered a copy for myself."
4,Solid Satellite TV Bookk,This is an excellent book. It was delivered in a timely way. Excellent service. A little technical for a guy who wants to set up a dish for his RV.
2,Not good for me,I liked their beginner DVD. This intermediate is not for me.It starts with arm exercises using a small ball which I'm guessingis a weighted ball. Mostly just swinging it from the front to the side/back.Very boring. The floor work was too difficult and hard on the wrists.
5,Message in a bottle,"I am typing this review with an autographed LP cover of Something Else by the Kinks, with all Kink signatures, inclusive of Ray and Dave, and whomever else was there in front of the Warwick Hotel in the early '70's in NYC. I agree with Nick Tosches, what would I take with me to a desert island, assuming of course I could carry with me whiskey, '50's girlie pin-ups, and nothing else for day after day? How would I get a phonograph record player, little least electricity? What else has been released since 1979? Imagine, if you will, a group of the top record reviewers from the 1960's & '70's, thinking just these thoughts. A great message in a bottle from the best rock critics before they became industry shills. Picture yourself this - what are your desert island choices all these years later? I'm looking at Something Else, autographed by Ray & Dave, I'm with Janet Maslin. Oh yeah, and with Nick, pass that whiskey bottle 'round here, mate."
4,for physicists outside particle physics,"I knew one of the authors (Coughlan) when we were undergraduates at the University of Western Australia. So it was with some interest that I went through this book. While I can't tell which was his contribution and which was the other author's, the combined effort is an elegant rendition of particle physics, circa late 1980s.A merit of the book is who it is pitched at. It is not really for a generalist outside physics. Rather, it seems best suited for the physicist (student or not) who is not in particle physics. Non-physicists may be surprised at this, but particle physics can seem strange and forbidding even to physicists. The text gives enough detailed physics to satisfy a physicist; that he is indeed getting enough of the real stuff to gain insight.While the title does say it is for scientists, I wonder a little about how accessible the book might be to a typical chemist or geologist."
2,Great Potential,"This movie definitely had great potential, but there were too many unanswered questions in this movie. I really enjoyed how the movie emphasized the mother and her love for her boys, how she tried to help the older boy to stand up for himself, and the bond she created between the two boys. Vanessa Williams is a dynamic actress and she played the role of the mother with great professionalism and greatness. But there were just too many gaps in the movie to allow it to be sensational. It needed more!"
3,OKAY MOVIE,THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD. A TOUCHING STORY PLUS ANOTHER REASON I LIKE THE MOVIE. IS BECAUSE MY COUSIN HAS THE LEAD ROLE LOL.
2,Bad Editing/Directing,"This movie had a good story line, good enough acting. My issue is with the director/editor. This movie was all over the place. For ex: the scene where he is on the train ""day dreaming"" was entirely too long. And some of the flash backs shown had no place in this particular scene. Placement of scenes was very awkward or out of order. Ok movie to stumble on and watch. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
3,"2 Brothers, 1 Soul......","Brotherly love prevails in this moving yet sometimes disturbing tale, about 2 brothers- 1 who is mentally disabled, who are eventually left to fend for themselves in the concrete jungle also known as New York. Shot well, and top - notch performances from the actors, I don't understand why Tatum'o Neal is in this movie and the only other thing I did not like , is that the story is told in multiple flashbacks, other than that, it was enjoyable."
2,Rate Delta 75722 Hand Held Shower Head,"The product price was good but the water flow was so restrictive I had to remove the water saver insert. Also, the hose attached to the hand held shower head is too stiff."
2,Parts Too Delicate,I bought two of these and was dissapointed that while installing one the hose connector just broke. I basically only have one working and it feels very delicate. I have to be using with extreme care. The parts are not metal but a fragile plastic.
1,I agree,I agree with the consensus of other reviewers. Don't bother purchasing. The instructions for installing are minimal at best. Once installed after following the directions we had excessive leaking and the shower head would not stay upright. One would wonder why the installation directions would note that teflon tape is recommended for installation to prevent leaking when other products used in the past are just screw on and you are good to go.
2,YoDagon,head works ok. lowers water presure and the hose chaged colors within two weeks of use. just basic cleaners used ..
2,A disappointment for me,"I'm sorry to lower the average rating, but I found this album to be a tremendous disappointment.I loved the simple, meaningful and melancholy tunes I heard from Eliott Smith on the ""Good Will Hunting"" soundtrack. I thought there was too much orchestra in XO, and was hoping to find something closer to what appealed to me about the ""Good Will Hunting"" songs in ""Elliott Smith"".I was disappointed. The lyrics are pretty good, but I found the music vapid and Smith's singing grating."
5,A suberb album,"The songs on these albums are magnificently crafted. I must say that after listening to songs such as The Biggest Lie, Coming Up Roses, Needle in the Hay, as well as Satellite, music has never been the same to me. Although it may sound depressing I can assure you his music can bring a multitude of emotions. The guitar picking in these songs are genious and simply breath taking especially in Satellite. Truly one of the greatest album and artist of our time!!"
4,new fan,i originally heard the first track on this album while watching the Royal Tenenbaums. I liked the song so much i bought this album. I am a new fan of elliot smith's music.
5,elliotts fragile beauty,"dude- okay, so i was different person once i heard elliotts music. and here's why. take this album. put it on and sit down and really listen to the way the words flow beautifully with the music. every song is good on the album, but i'd say my favorites are good to go, alphabet town, and coming up roses. i listen to the last line of good to go, when theres a beautiful breakdown in the song, and he says the line, ""i'm waiting for something that's not coming. that actually makes me want to cry. then the crack of his voice in alphabet town when he says, "" i'm ready to go out."" and the harmony and rise in coming up roses. elliott's the truest and most talented person in todays music, and no one can hear his music and not be affected by it. buy the album, listen to it a few times, and then you'll understand..."
2,A Wanna-be writes a book,"The book is a lot of hot air and very, very poorly written. There are so many typos that I wonder if anyone proof-read it. The guy was/is a thug, wants to be Malcolm X, knocks up his girlfriend, bails out of town (no mention who supports his children), knocks up a 16 year old overseas (abandons her), and pretends to be a ""soldier."" He talks a lot of (garbage), but never had the courage to get into any military. The book is written on a junior high level and unfortunately is filled with so many inaccuracies that the reports of the FBI ignoring reports out of Phoenix lost all credibility if this is the guy that did the informing. He's a ... he won't get a job and will live on welfare from the gov't while talking (garbage) against the gov't. He's just milking the 9/11 incident for all that it's worth. What a pity."
1,Lies and Puffery from John Walker Lindh-Lookalike,"Before John Walker Lindh there was Collins. A criminal failure who hooked up with al-Quida allies in jail and lived off of his America-hating buddies until it just got too uncomfortable. Now, in the wake of tragedy, he is off to make his dime off of the American public with stories about how different it all could have been if the professionals in the US law enforcement and intelligence community would just have listened to him. Well, it just doesn't fly. Collin's writing is poor, his account is self-serving, and all-too-often his claims just don't check out. Collins will likely escape punishment for his treasonous activities. He does not, however, deserve readers' attention or money."
1,Hot-headed wannabe needs to cool-off,"This is a book about a self-righteous wannabe warrior. Even though the book is written by him, it doesnt portray him in a good light. He is too absorbed in himself to admit to any wrongdoing: He blames everybody else for his problems, doesnt hide his arrogance, cant follow orders (as a good soldier is supposed to), etc..He seems to think that he knows better than everyone else. And its no wonder that he gets in trouble whereever he goes.. His latest thing is getting arrested in Mexico as an over-zealous bounty hunter(this guy seems to be very impulsive and doenst know anything about self-control)..But I have to say that the book is entertaining.I would suggest that he takes a break from his adventures and search for humility and peace-of-mind. And then write a book about it:)"
3,"A fun read, but so are comics","My perspective is probably biased by my many years of military service, but here goes. The book reads like a good adventure novel and perhaps gives some insight into the loosely and even chaotically organized management style of many jihadists and their tendency to degenerate from religious warriors into common gangsters. However, it is hard to take the collection of stories seriously, sometimes they read like comics with Collins as a jihadist version of Captain America, minus the cool uniform. The nice thing about comics is that they have distinctive artwork and are not presented as having historical, political and religious significance and the writers are not self righteous.At any rate, if any of these stories were being spun at the local tavern, the storyteller would definitely earn some free drinks."
1,The story of a criminal,"The book is little more that a self-important story of a low-level thug. The real question is why the book's author is not in prison. He openly admitted to have committed numerous murders. He is a US citizen. He has no immunity from prosecution. His affiliation with the CIA and FBI was unofficial. Is there no prosecutor in Baltimore who would be interested in a great career-making move? It makes me wonder if American reading public would sink so low as to read Bin Laden's account of his sorry life, should The Lyons Press decide to publish that as well. Hey, as long as it makes them money it doesn't matter who dies: Russians or Americans."
2,A never was and his book.,"What looks like a great book is merely a good book. Having been and actually worked in some of the same areas, I eagerly awaited the release of this book. I read it in two days. Sadly, it ranks a little above Spooky 8 in terms of realism.I do admire the author for his sincere belief to fight injustice. If only the rest of the world was as noble. If you are reading this to find out about ""high speed"" stories read something else. If you are wanting to read about a reformed criminal who ""trains"" himself in tactics and is best friends with the killer of Daniel Pearl. Well, this is the book for you."
2,A celebration of bloodlust and fanaticism,"I agree with reviewer ""Fred""; this Collins guy is a real schmuck. While the book is very well written, there's just so little to like about the author and his philosophy, let alone his ""jihad"". He appears more than a little delusional about who the bad guys are (sometimes there are just no good guys, period), and seems to forget his Chechen buddies are fond of murdering innocents in terrorist attacks throughout Russia. Sorry guy, a terrorist is a terrorist. You can't clean it up & justify it by saying it's for Allah."
5,"At last, some real answers!","This is a fantastic read and I would advise anyone with a serious interest in the subject of Islam and Jihad to read it. I am certain that many Christian findamentalists and Right-wing readers won't like what they find in this book, but hey, you can't hide your head in the sand for ever, people.One of the most amazing discoveries for me about this book is the concept of 'Mujahedeen', it seems very close to the concept of 'knights' in the Christian tradition. I can't wait for a film to be made about this guy, he is a modern hero."
5,Relax with some therapeutic poetry!,"You'll love the inspirational, personal style of Pamela Jarmon's poetry. Single parents will find this book very uplifting. Elusive Ink RX Poetry should be part of everyone's library!"
5,One's life verbalized through poetry-Excellent!,"Rx Poetry is a wonderful book of poetry that allows you to share a wide range of emotions with author Pamela Jarmon. Her ginuwine style comes through in every poem, and that is what poetry is about. Many will be able to read and relate to the emotional highs and lows, and that in itself gives word to the reader that they are not alone. I loved it from cover to cover! A great addition to any poetry collection."
4,Good Info,I found this book informative. It has a wide range of information much of it I was already aware of. The break down on cost and markup was eye opening and made me reconsider my old school approach of fixed markup. The contract section is just as good though and worth a mention.
3,Not so tough,I've used other Tae Bo workouts (first Bootcamp series + others) and this was not much of a challenge in comparrison. My wife finds this ok as a change of pace.If all you do are his tapes/dvds then this is probably a nice change up from his more strenous material. If you are looking for a hard workout this is not likely for you.
3,disappointed,I was excited to know that billy blanks had a new cd. I ordered the cd thinking that it would be like his other high energy exercise cds. I was sadly disappointed. This cd is more fluff and not enough exercise. You will not get your heart rate up on this one. I have been a follower of Tae Bo for over 10 years and I just expect more from him than some slow motion moves that do not resemble any exercise I have ever seen.
1,ANGRY CUSTOMER,"TO DATE I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY PRODUCT, OR AN EXPLANATION. I WAS TOLD THAT THE ORDER WOULD BE DELIVERED BY 8/7/09 AT THE LATEST.I HAVE SUBMITTED MY PHONE NUMBER AND STILL NOTHING! IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!"
1,"Not CUCO, lame versions of classics",This is not Cuco Sanchez. This is one of those poor productions with poor material not worth buying and not worthy of a full review. Some copy-catter trying to make a quick buck.
5,dog clown costume,this is just the cutest costume ever....gave it as a gift and the owner just loved it. highly recommend...
5,The classic,"The Faulk's C-50 was a great call when I was a kid and still is and I am almost 50. I have many calls that do a fine job but my favorite is a 35 year old C-50. It is well made and the tone improves with age. As a personal preference, I like the wood calls better than the synthetic."
5,Crows,"This crow call is excellent. Don't bother with any others. I use two or three short blasts, quick on the start. Follow with three or somtimes two cawws. Stay silent a while also helps. Who knows what the call is telling them, but they will show up in numbers to check it out. If they see you, it's over."
5,Get it!,"Synapscape is the best industrial noise, cold noise, rythm noise, dark noise,......NOISE!!!...band in the world. Everything you could possibly want to make other people hate your taste in music is on this album. Truly the best of the noisy bands."
1,save your money,"There are several problems with this book. First, it is clear that the authors know next to nothing about trading. One of the purposes of using technical analysis avoid the volatility of a buy and hold strategy, so unless you are comparing on a risk adjusted basis, the conclusion is meaningless. Secondly, the authors don't reveal the values they plugged into the indicators. Did they test a 5 and 10 day moving averages, or was it some other value? How did they arrive at the values they used? And the way they constructed their database was totally biased."
3,"Good, but could be more useful","If you are wondering why the efficient market theory/technical analysis debate can't be put to rest by empirical data, you need wonder no longer. Bauer and Dahlquist establish beyond question (at least to those with open minds) that technical analysis does work. Real TA fans will be disappointed, though, that the edge TA gives is shown to be minuscule. One of the most interesting conclusions from this book is the fact that purely mechanical systems, based on one or two indicators, and applied with no real preselection of stocks, probably will not make you any money. What is missing from this book is a study of the use of chart formations (other than candlesticks) in conjunction with indicators."
5,Belongs in every trader's library,"A computerized analysis of a fistful of technical indicators, each treated as a system unto itself. Analysis done only on stocks. See Van Tharp's book, Trade your way to financial freedom. (That's at least close - my copy has been borrowed.)"
4,Great Reference Book,"If you have ever wanted to know how bollinger bands are constructed, this is the book for you. It explains how every conceivable indicator is constructed and the theory behind the construction. I am not a trader so I will not comment on the authors' testing methodology. I only used the book for work, for research and anylatical purposes."
1,waste of your time and money,Book is useless for someone trying to make money in the stock market. Its purpose is to pad these guy's resumes.
4,Fine. Go Larger. I Found a better one!,"Birds do OK in cages this size, if they are small ones, but do yourself, and your birds a favor, get the largest cage you can afford. This one is pretty good, looks good, relatively easy to clean, easy to put together.After using this one, we discovered a better one, with an important advantage: our birds can get some good exercise, becasue the cage is oriented lengthwise! Also, this cage is much easier to clean and service the food and water. Costs about $95: the Vision II model LO1"
4,EARLY SUBS !!!!!!!!!!,"3 VHS TRANSFER onto a DVD.The first gig is amazing,very after punk sounding,Flood Of lies being presented at the moment.Sound is incredibly ok for a punk 1983 film,picture is not top notch but like on a standard VHS,OK though.2nd gig sound is barely tolerable but raw and full of energy and funny situations.3rd gig with New Barbarians,sound same as 2nd only I don't like em,so.....NICE IF YOU'RE A SUBS FAN,plus I got it dirt cheap too !!!!!!"
2,Amazon's experts should do better on their recommendations,"I bought this book after reading the recommendations and the reviews posted on Amzaon. This book was highly overated. The premise is certainly interesting, a retelling of Frankestein through his sister/fiance. The book just doesn't hold together terribly well. It's feminism is of the bludgeon over your head type, lacking in nuance and subtlety, and the main character really appeared to be a man's creation of a feminist female prototype. Very disappointing"
1,Disappointing,"After the fabulous Flicker (the sort of book that won't let you put it down) I couldn't wait for this one. Whilst the writing certainly leaves an indelible impression poor old Mary Shelley would I think be writhing in her grave. Unfortunately I found that his premise of writing the feminist Frankenstein laughable to say the least. A lot of nonsense about the feminine mysteries of childbirth and sexuality made me squirm, which seems to me a hippy's version of how the world really was man. Ultimately, it seems to deal less with womens truth, and more of what a male author more than a little obsessed with the tantra (remember bhoga from Flicker?), would prefer to be the truth."
4,Eye of the World,I have been after this CD for some time and was pleased with the fact that I managed to get one in so good condition
3,quick read,Interesting insight into extreme loneliness and depression. It's definitely worth the read. It's about the length of a short story.
2,rating,"writing style is good, but i strongly disliked the moral background and the characters in this story. too many questions and too flat of character"
3,Buy another version,This Guttenberg Project version is visually a wreck. Horrific line-breaks and awkward spacing.Great story. I love it.Buy another version - one that is better prepared for your Kindle. This is terrible to read.
3,Good enough,"First off, I want to say that this review is about the actual novella -- not the packaging. The packing itself of this is excellent, and I would be very interested in obtaining more copies of novellas published by the Art of the Novella series.As far as the story itself, it is fine, but never really goes beyond that. It is well told and interesting, but I really don't understand what makes it a classic (to be fair, I never studied Melville in classes, so perhaps I am missing some subtext). I found Bartleby to be somewhat annoying and unsympathetic. I suppose I understand the metaphor of someone rejecting the daily monotonous business cycle, but at least in the story, Bartleby signed up for it. Thus, his refusal to work seems less like rebellion and more like laziness.The story was fine, but not quite what I was hoping for."
5,"It's not the book, it's the shipping","The book was required reading for my daughter. When none of our local bookstores had this book and ordering would take seven days or more, I turned to Amazon knowing that I could ship the book overnight if it was in stock. That is what I did. I went to Amazon, the book was in stock and paid twice what the book was worth for OVERNIGHT SHIPPING. How long did it take me to get the book? SEVEN DAYS!!! I paid for overnight shipping and it still took SEVEN DAYS to get this book. I will think twice before getting ripped off by AMAZON again!! BEWARE OF OVERNIGHT SHIPPING ON AMAZON!"
2,Symbolic tale remains a bore...,"Like the reader from Berkeley, I cringed throughout ""Bartleby."" It is easy to understand why this talented author was unappreciated during his post-Moby Dick period. Although rich in symbolism, the story hardly captivates the reader. Instead of a tale, ""Bartleby"" comes across as an assignment. I read the story once in high school and I'm devasted to discover I must re-read it for college. Honestly, I prefer not to..."
3,Lititure assignment,I would recomend the book even though it was only a mediocre book but had an assume punch ending.
2,UGH!!!,"I would rather beat my brains out with a stick than ever have to read Bartleby again. Don't get me wrong, I fully understand the work. I know it's supposed to be a classic and wonderful. I just can't stand it. I suppose it's worth reading... once. But I can't imagine anyone wanting to read it over and over. It's horrific."
4,Matt Skinner knows his stuff!,"I'm in the wine industry and it's an overwhelming breath of fresh air that Matt Skinner breathes into this very old tradition of winemaking and appreciation. ""Thirsty Work"" is a cheeky, fresh but intelligent overview of wine production, sytles and culture. I bought 2 copies through Amazon, one to keep and one to give away. I could have given away 15! This is such an interesting and informative, yet an easy read. It's great to see the art of wine appreciation being accessible to the younger generation through this happy book."
5,"It's a Ka-Bar, what else is there to say?","The only Ka-Bar I got out of the Marine Corps with is glued to a plaque so not of much use. I love this knife for camping, hiking, and general utility. I can't believe how long it took me to getting around to buying one. I do wish it would have come with the leather sheath rather than that ugly plastic thing, but it was only a few dollars more to order the sheath separately and I'm sure I can sell the one that came with it. It's not that it isn't a good sheath, but I wanted to wear it on my belt and the leather one is much better for that."
2,NOT FULL SIZE!!!,Quality is unbeatable but this thing is way smaller than a similar kabar at the same price. This is a collector item only.
5,"Chipped paint, dinged walls no more!","Yes, I have a 1 oz touch up paint bottle, no I have not used it in a while.This great idea saves those accidental wall tappings. Two car garage? Yeah with 12 inches between my side(the wall) and the wifes car. Open the door for to get out and the first holding stop with the swing of the door taps the wall. Touch up paint was commonly used.Placed this protector on the wall and no more dings. I do not have to constantly monitor how I open my door. No worries."
3,"Good wrench, bad trigger",The impact wrench that I bought from Amazon.com has good power but after using it a couple of times the trigger sticks whenever I use it now. What to do?
1,"For sports fans, not music lovers","This is the story of the contestants, not the music, in the 6th van Cliburn Piano Competition in Dallas. The show relentlessly pursues the question of who is going to win the grand prize. This production is 90% talk and 10% music. Except for the three movements from three works played by the winner at the end, all pieces consist of approximately 15 seconds of piano playing. None are identified.The producer of the show seems to have thought that any amount of piano playing would bore the audience, and instead concentrated on the process of competition.An alternate title for this disk would be ""Piano Competition for People Who Hate the Classics."""
1,Not what I thought,"I watched a rare videotape of this competition in music class many years ago, it was great, had a lot of talks but at same time a lot of performance. I saw this DVD and expected it to be just a remake of the tape, so I didn't mind the first review. Gosh how wrong I was, this is NOT the tape, which had enough playing to let you know how good and which style was each contestant. This DVD just cut out all the good parts (which is the performance of course) and kept a bunch of talk crap. We don't care about the background of the competition, if we're willing to buy a DVD we know what the heck Van Cliburn competition is. We just want to hear them playing! And what did we get? Like 30 seconds of Santiago Rodriguez! After all these years I still remember he was the best soloist in the whole competition, and here we just get to know he was married, with kids, do we really care about that? NO!!"
1,Never received from Amazon,"I wouldn't know how this book is. I ordered it December 11 2005 and never received it. Amazon cancelled my order in March because they said they did not receive confirmation from me that there would be a delay. Not only could I show proof I had given the confirmation, I also had an email with an apology saying they would send it to me for free. But because they cancelled my order, we had to start it again. Expected delivery time is the middle of May. 6 months to get a book from Amazon - the book people. What a joke!!"
5,English health resources in Spanish,Excellent that there is a health remedy book originally written in English and translated for Spanish-speaker use. GREAT book!
2,Disappointing,"The scanner itself is excellent, 5 stars. But the slide adapter produces fuzzy images which all need a great deal of color correcting. I am a professional artist/graphic designer and would NOT recommend this transparency adapter to anyone. It is extremely overpriced at $450-500 for the really terrible quality results it generates."
4,Nice Introduction,"This is a good introduction of the different practices in meditation. Some topics covered are shamanism, christian mysticism, the kabbalah, yoga, koans, zazen, kundalini, visualization and tai chi. The book first gives culture information, and then goes on to explain the meditation technique. I like the way the book describes the meditation process of each tradition - of course this is a highly subjective area, but good nevertheless. It attempts to explain what exactly you are to think about when you are meditating."
4,AN EXCELLENT MEDITATION GUIDE...,"The author covers all the important elements for the beginner on the art of meditation, clearly and to the point. Very useful inrtuctions."
5,Good book,This is a good history book on Greece during WWII. It was very interesting and I would recommend this book.
3,"Caution, EC3 packages are 2 males or 2 females, not a mixture",You need to buy two packages with different kinds of connectors. Inspect the pictures of what you order.EC5 connectors seem to come with one of each.
3,"Great for roofing, weak for siding","This book has fairly complete coverage of roofing, but only has about 25 or so pages on siding. I was pretty disapointed in this book because I bought it in preparation for residing my house."
5,Neural Network Systems Vol.1 by Cornelius T. Leondes,"The book contains interesting contributions in different areas of artificial neural networks.It covers a broad range of paradigms. Also a section is included on applications of neuralnetworks to finite contraint satisfaction problems and discrete optimization. The editor, professpr Cornelius T. Leondes has done a good job in assembling different materials in a coherent volume. The book may be useful forresearchers and practiotiones. Content is usable even today, after some 10 years of publication date."
4,A real review,"For a serious appraisal, see the review by Mary Ann Glendon, Learned Hand Chair at Harvard Law School, at http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9611/reviews/glendon.html"
5,It's life,"Before I even read this book, I already knew all about the story cause one of the bands that influenced me most, Skid Row wrote a song about Ricky Kasso - 18 and Life. Call me twisted or whatever but Kasso's like a legend to me now. We can't really blame Jimmy or Ricky for all those sh*t. After all, from where they are, it's all a part of life....Mail me if you're into this book as well.SkidGirl skidette@pacific.net.sg"
3,Was it a satanic killing or not?,This is a documentary of two young boys and how they went from great athletes in junior high to drug addicted satanist. Did Rickie Kasso kill Gary Lauers because he was high on LSD or was it in the name of satan? Did Rickie's best friend Jimmy help him or just stand by and watch. The book takes you through the events of each boys life that led up to the killing and through the court room verdict. I think it is a sad book and when your done reading it you alomst feel as sorry for the two boys as you do for the victom
1,Say you love Satan,"Ciao, the sad part of this whole novel is that it is B.S.. I grew up with thes guys, there is one part with Russel from K.P.. How in the world did a conversation occur when Woody never was interviewed? Colorful book, though very distorted. The real issue was over Dust, Angel dust that is. To be more percise the label was ""Crazy Eddie"". Anyway I said my piece. Ci verdiamo Johnny"
2,Disppointed in the lack or realism,I read this book several years ago while sitting in the library. It was a very quick read yet quite simplistic in nature. I grew up in the same town and during the time period in which these events took place. I followed the case closely through the news reports when it actually happened. There are many facts that are not properly represented in the book. I was hoping for something more realisitc when i picked up this book. I did enjoy reading it despite this.
4,If you find it...read it,"I was walking through a store and looked up and saw a book title I knew would drive my parents teachers and friends running to the shrinks. I had never heard of Ricky Kasso or Nothport Long Island. It is the easiest book to read since See Jane jump Spot. The story pulls you in from the first page. Before your realize it you're sucked into the life of a troubled kid whose life takes an unexpected turn and shows how easily a kid can go wrong. I was 16 when I first read it. I've gad 6 copies of the book 5 of which vanished. The last I found hidden in the stacks at the library. If nothing else it should be part of some required reading list for would be parents. The book changed my life. Even the most heartless can't put the book down without Rcky, Jimmy or Gary sticking with them for years."
5,A WONDERFUL finale to the MacKenzie family saga,"WOW ! What a finale to this 6 book series. I've read them all & couldn't wait for TRIUMPH. The story of Tia & Taylor, was a beautifully told romance. The book also kept you in tune with the other characters you fell in love with in REBEL, SURRENDER, GLORY and of course the ones that started it all, RUNAWAY & CAPTIVE. I could not put this book down, as with any other of Heather Graham's novels. The only disappointment is that the story of the MacKenzie's is now complete! Hats of to Heather Graham !"
5,Perfect Ending,"This is the perfect ending to the McKenzie saga. Although I was hoping for a story about Sydney, Tia takes the main stage and runs with it. She is not immune to the hard times of the war, and makes a stand all on her own. And Taylor isn't too shabby himself. I wasn't able to put this book down at all. I think I read it in the manner of two days. Graham is a wonderful story teller.There were some odd things that happened towards the end of the book, and I am hoping that it was the printer's fault and not Ms Graham forgetting her character names. Ian's youngest daughter is named Katie (I think), and at the end of the book is called Kelly. When Tia tells Jarrett she is pregnant again for the 5th time, Jarrett hopes that it is a girl after 4 boys--but Tia's first child is a girl.The McKenzie saga is one of the best stories I have ever read. I am very sad to see it end. I hope that Ms Graham one day continues the McKenzie saga with the grandkids--Sean, Jamie, and the rest of the kids."
4,Triumph (Florida Civil War),love anything by Heather Graham and this series was excellent. I only wish all of them were available as e-books for Kindle.
1,Not for me.,"I did not read very far into the book to discover that the premise of betrayal and death was more than I could handle. I even deleted it from my archived books. Someone else might have been able to read it, but not me."
3,I did not know this book...,"was like the 6th in a series. Hence, I did not know many of the characters and was overwhelmed by the quantity of them. If the story stayed with Tia and Taylor, I would have been OK but the author kept bringing in characters from past books that I knew nothing about. I stopped reading after a rape scene of a husband and wife (I guess he saved her from jail in the last book). I just was not interested enough to keep going - the men were a bit too rough & mean in this book for my taste. I know someone else critized the rape scenes too."
4,Different from Yikes,"First of all, this is more of a storybook than a comic book. For those of you that are familiar with Weissman's work in Yike's, this is slightly different.There is really only one storyline for ""Champs,"" and since it was done all at once, there isn't as much of a variety of artistic style as with ""Yikes."" The art quality is different - a little more hurried, and some might argue not as good. The story itself has that familiar, delightful creepiness of the original ""Yikes,"" although it is sometimes lacking. The underlying themes of the story are interesting and reminiscent of childhood.I do, however, find that I appreciate this book the more I read it, and I recommend it to any Weissman fans."
1,What The....?,"I had seen (And enjoyed) some of Weissman's other work before, and it seemed like everyone who ever reviewed a Yikes! book had nothing but praise, so I took the plunge: I bought Champs and Don't Call Me Stupid, and pre-ordered White Flower Day....I guess it must be me....I just don't get it. At all. I had trouble telling the characters apart. They all look the same! Much like Seinfeld, Champs is about nothing. Unlike Seinfeld, I didn't think it was funny. I did get a brief chuckle out of the fact that the entire world seems to revolve around children (Witness the infant Toreador, and the huge crowds that turn out to see Big Wheel races...),but that quickly passed, and I was left pondering the imponderable, such as...Why is that kid called ""Sweet"" Chubby Cheeks? Why is a Vampire tot able to run around in broad daylight? Who made Pullapart Boy? Why did I buy this? I would advise the curious to give this a quick browse before buying to see if it's your cuppa tea. Sadly, it wasn't mine."
1,No thanks,"The tape was the poorest quality I have ever seen except for perhaps our home movies. It was not labeled except for a small sticker saying ""Truck Video."" Very amateurish, a lot of water, choppy photography that moved too fast, and every time he got close to people a new scene appeared. Sorry, but I just can't think of anything positive to say about this film. (This price) for a bootlegged quality tape? No thanks."
5,Great item.,"The shaving cream is for a relative for Christmas, but I am confident he will like it and order more in the future."
3,OK but,"This is a very large quantity container but, it didn't have the smell I was looking for. It smelled more like cheap bathroom soap. Otherwise nice lather and good shave."
3,Misting system,I thought it would have more misters going up the snake. Only 2 misters at the very top. It works ok but I expected more.
1,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,I have this item it is not worth the price we paid for it . It is smaller than expected and does not do what it states that it should . Also it was made so cheap that it broke within 5 min. I bought it so when we went camping I could stay a little cooler. Great in idea but not so great in action.
3,havnt used it yet but...,um this sucks.. i wouldnt have paid 22$ for 1 yes 1 of these plastic thingies...u dont get 4 .. which they show and never said only get 1 pos for 22 dollars?? cmon.. 6 buks tops id pay for 1.. and its only like 3ft high i think my 4 yr old is taller.. i know he is.. dont buy from amazon.. idk where else has em but i dont think 1 is gona b worth 22 dollars.. just my opinion... :)
3,Just ok,This misting system falls little short of what I thought it would be. It's great if there is no wind or breeze. The mist is so little you either have to keep moving around to enjoy it or hope there is no wind.
2,Works.....sort of!,"In windy conditions the mister is fairly useless.,even without wind the personal mister works best if under a tent, umbrella or some other semi-covered/contained situation. A simple hand held spray bottle with a mist setting would be more effective... Or a misting bottle with a fan."
3,Mister stopped working,"After a couple of weeks, the mister stopped working. I was happy that I was refunded promptly when I returned it."
4,good value-good product,I've seen others costing much more-but these work great! A good way to keep the kids cool in the yard during the summer
4,Great Personal Mister,"This is an excellent personal mister. It might be nice to lie under in the sun. I use it while I garden to keep me cool. I think we may start using it on the porch as well. If you don't use the little hose attachment provided, it will leak, but if you use the provided attachment, there's no issue. It's billed as a personal mister and won't easily mist a large area, but I knew what I was getting when I bought it. I was surprised by the amount of mist it put out and I'm overall impressed with the product. I do have a feeling, though, that it was not very expensive to make and I feel that it probably could be sold for a slightly lower price."
4,GREAT LITTLE PORTABLE MISTER,We use this mister (there are only two little metal mister nozzles at the top) for keeping the pets cool in the heatwave months. The summers get very hot and dry and our three pets hang around the cool water spray most of the day. The water hose can be turned on with just a little pressure and works all day long to provide a fine mist from the top. The wild birds flock to get drinks of water from the mist that falls on the grass. The mister we received was purple and the base is a bit wobbly so we have to use something to prop it on one end to keep from tipping; but there haven't been any issues yet from it falling over. The wobbling is the only issue keeping this at 4 stars instead of 5.
1,Disappointing,"This product was NOT as described. Fake leather band, plastic swing, cheesy manufacture. Service was great, however; the company took my return promptly with no fuss."
5,Unbelievable,"Are you kidding!!!! This guy is so tremendously talented. Mark my words -- watch for him in 2 years -- he will be a top artist, with many accolades to his name.A must buy for any true music lover!!!"
5,"Finally a ""SOLID"" Sound",I was fortunate to recieve Eric Lautenbach's CD as a gift. The range and variety of the tracks make this the perfect CD for any occasion. I enjoy the CD whether I am lacing up my Nike's for a pick-up game on the 4th Avenue Courts or unwinding @ home after a dinner with my wife @ the Carnegie Deli.Every muscian/artist should be blessed with the ability produce their work with the same passion and grace as Eric Lautenbach.This is a MUST for anyone's CD collection.
5,From the Heart,It is obvious that the investment in this work is from the heart. That is why I love to share it with friends and always play it when entertaining guests. It would be a mistake to not have this music at your fingertips.
4,Escape from Bespin Leia,"This is a very nice Leia figure, I have noticed that some Leia figures look very manish. This figure, however, is a good sculpt of her."
1,What is this?,"Christopher Hart cannot spell anime and his definition of art is poor. This guy doesn't know what he is doing. His anime is bootleg -its not the real deal. Its very poor quality and the style is very americanized and horribly weak. If it were possible, I'd take all publishing rights and access away from Hart. His books should not be sold. If you want a real anime instruction book, stick to the ones penned by Japanese artists who really know what they are talking about. By giving 1 star I am only acknowledging the people who actually had to spend their time putting this joke together. I'm sorry but if possible I would give a negative valued star rating. Straight up, buying this book is equivalent to taking 30 dollars and burning it in a small bonfire. Not impressed."
2,GAH!!! x.o;,"I own this book, and am beginning to wish I don't. I thought it was neat at first, but it really doesn't go into technique that much. Oh sure, it demonstrates how to draw the eyes and a couple of other things, but otherwise I didn't find anything all that useful.Now, my preference is the books from the How-To-Draw-Manga series... n_n"
4,Review of Manga Mania,"I believe this book is a very good book for beginning anime/manga drawers. It touches on many basics, though doesn't go into them too deeply. It aslo includes a section on how to draw elven character, shojo style, and talks about the ways to make your drawings more dynamic. I don't think it would be much help to experienced drawers, however, since it really would only show you the things you already know. As i said, for beginners this will be a good introduction, after that i recomend the How to Draw Anime series.~Lupus"
2,Just my opinion,"I find the ""bad boys"" section to be rather lacking. All the guys look comic bookish, and they don't have a picture that looks like Hiiro Yui! The ""drop dead gourgeous babe"" section is rather..odd. For example, my when my friend looked at the teenage valley girl pic, he was like,"" is that a man?"" The elf section is terrific, but it is only a few pages long. Not enough about shading, you might like it if your a shounen anime type person though. I recommend other manga books if you want your manga art work to be less american, and have better noses."
1,this is rediculous,"This is silly. You can hardly trust an american to teach you the skills needed to draw anime/manga. What a waste of money, even the cover art is sloppy and basic. You could get a lot more out of just surfing the net for untranslated manga and using that as a guide, it'd make a considerable improvement. Just go and compaire whats in this book to the artwork of Kaori Yuki-sama! *.* ...Well, I guess there is a bit of a bright side to buying a book like this, it can teach you the basics of body construction and proportions. That's prettymuch all I've gotten from mine. XP Contrary to the popular belief of american anime people, theres so much more to anime than the stereotypical big eyes, mechas, and big-breasted-bishoujo.(though those ARE constant factors in many :P) But I guess it IS your choice after all...I'm just a simple reviewer sharing my input. ;P"
1,*cough*,"Skip this book. It's not real anime or manga for that matter. It's very western. Even then, most of the pictures aren't his own artwork. I've even checked out his drawing American comics and it was very bad....save your cash....I would check outManga Techniques 1 & 2 (for non-ecchi people)How to Draw Manga (Ecchi people)"
4,Great book!,"This book is great! It tells you so much information about things you should know if you wanna make some manga! This book REALLY improved my manga drawings! My drawings looked like..., and after I read this book, I got a better understanding of manga.The only bad thing in this book is that it couldv'e been more step-by-step. Most things only have 3-4 steps! But even so, I greatly appreciated this book!At first I was a little skeptical about this book, because it was from an American guy. Chris Hart may not be Rumiko Takahashi, but he is really skilled in drawing!I think that you should get this book!"
5,"Really awesome, but...","This book is a must-have for any manga artist, whether a beginner or pro. The only thing not-so-great about it was that the eyes weren't explained quite enough. But it is otherwise really amazing, and covers everyhting from elves to Shojo and Shonen manga to samauri drawing and drawing dragons and robots."
5,A thorough book and necessity for any Manga Artist!,This is a great book that covers everything the human figure to dragons. This book is a great reference for beginners as well as old pros!
2,Too Explicit for Fifth Graders,"I bought Manga Mania for my 12-year-old niece for Christmas as she's getting into Japanese cartoons (she's started watching Robotech!). I decided to thumb through this title before wrapping it up and was disturbed by chapter 7, ""Drop-Dead-Gorgeous Manga Babes.""Hart's publishers state it's appropriate for 5th graders (10-year-olds) and up but I decided not to give my niece this book based on this chapter. The females are scantily clad and the descriptions that accompany them are explicit (e.g. ""Her bathing suit is a great costume because it's skin tight and wet""). I know this is a part of the genre but I think the content is too suggestive for young teens.I ultimately went for Hart's other title, ""Anime Mania"" which did a good job of describing illustration and character development without focusing so much on sexiness."
5,Great book!,"I think that anyone who cannot afford the ""How to Draw Manga"" series should get this if they want to draw manga. It even helped me, someone who has been drawing manga for a few months now."
3,Little explaining,"Though from what I've seen of Christopher Hart he is o.k. Though when it comes to manga ....he is a bit too western style. I got this as a gift and after looking through I was disappointed. I mean he hardly explained anything!Though it is all right if you want to see anime not draw it,but for me some pictures had a mix of too much western style in it.If you have the money can't find Official books buy it otherwise stay away."
5,first sight,I think this book is fantastic with its unique practice characters. Many begining artists will love learning how to be a japaneze comic book maker. remember this; no one can out beat a manga artist.
5,"Amazing, Compeling and Completly Helpful","Compelling and helpful. Once you pick it up, you wont want to put it down. This book comes complete with a ""How to"" section for: Basics, Body Anotomy, Eyes, Hair, Kids, Teens, Creatures/Pets, Elves, Robots, Mutants, Sameri, Fairies, Bad/Good guys, Dragons and more!Great book for all ages, If your a beginner or long time artist, no matter the genre you fancy, this will help. It gives complete details and step by step illistrations that will make you want to draw everytime you read it. Also helps with: Shadowing, Clothing, Settings, etc. etc. etc.With Western and Manga outlooks, also a section in the back of job descriptions if ""you want to be cartoonist"".I got this book for christmas after begging for it when I read the other reviews, hope this is helpful and all expectations are met. This book met mine and suprised me with even more. Very Informative, highly Suggested, in my opinion, fully deserves its 5 stars."
2,Er...Heh.,"Two years ago I bought his 'How to Draw Japanese Animation"" book and it was pretty well-made for me as I was an amateur at anime and manga styles.So I was slightly hoping that this one would rival his other book.I. Was. Wrong.When I bought it, the art looked like that of a western animation, unworthy of any soon-to-be mangaka's collection of 'How to draw' books. If you'd take a look at the cover...I can draw ten times times better than that without looking at any sources for help. Hart has a lively sense of humor in his guides, but the art is lacking in volume and depth."
3,Good but distracting,"Christopher Hart has put out several excellent books for beginners and the intermidate cartoon/comicbook artists. I especially liked his ones on Anatomy and Good Looking ComicBook Women. This book is no different in the skill in which he displays this new style. However, whoever put together the format and pictures for this edition should be shot... or at the very least fired. An investment in Adobe's Streamline would have atleast been helpful. Instead all of Christopher Heart's excellent work and fantastic graphical display of style were ruined by what appears to be 24 DPI graphics or worse in some places. And this is not consistant throughout the book. On the merit of Chris Hart's work alone I would give it a 5, his artistic skill is without a doubt excellent, however the format it was presented in gained it a 1...... so I guess a 3 is the best I can hope to offer it in the way of rating."
2,"Try the ""How to Draw Manga"" series instead","I bought this book at the beginning of my interest in manga, and the only help it gave me was the Japenese phrases at the back. I keep the book around for that reason, but not much else. If you're a budding manga artist, or on more advanced level, I highly recommend the ""How to Draw Manga"" line of books instead of this one. The ""How to Draw Manga"" series covers a wide spread of manga topics, from starting basics to advanced pen and tone techniques. They even have books dealing specifically with shojo and shonen art! (I have already pre-ordered the Costume Encyclopedia that comes out in Feb. 2003!) Mr. Hart's work is good if you want a reference for WESTERN cartooning, but not for manga and animé."
2,Hmmmmm...,"This book is good, but FAR from the best! When I got this, it seemed like a really good helpful book! Nothing really was too helpful though. Then I got some How to Draw Manga books (techniques for drawing female characters, male characters, and a few others) and I was blown away! This book is good, but if you really want to draw better, get some How to Draw Manga books!"
2,Unnecessary,"I kind of wonder who this book was written for. Inexperienced artists seem to get frustrated with the lack of step-by-step instructions (if you're one of these people, I would encourage you try tracing instead -- you'll achieve the same result). More experienced artists would do better to check out Tadashi Ozawa's 'How to Draw Anime & Game Characters'. It's hard to find, but worth the effort."
1,Pretty Bad,"I bought this book about nine years ago, when I was very young and before Anime and Manga had penetrated the mainstream market here. Even then I understood that there was something seriously off about this book. The author, Christopher Hart, is neither a good artist nor does he understand the core visual principles of manga. The digital coloring is also pretty awful, but you might be able to chalk that up somewhat to the age of the book."
3,Manga Mania,"This book is good for almost anyone who likes to draw, especially manga or anime. It goes over several areas in drawing manga, but not in detail. It showed me a lot I didn't know, but it didn't really improve my skill. This book is mostly for beginners."
4,Manga Mainia,"...Well I have to say that this is my first manga book, and this book has helped me out alot. I seem to like their elf/scienceficion/ fantasy/dragon section, and their tips at the back of the book. What I don't like is that it doesn't have much on hands. I hate how they inked the picutes, and could hardly see their eyes on the ones they inked. Other wise it was great. I would recomend a book that has more detail. This book still hasn't helped me with drawing folds...."
2,'Manga Mania' from an otaku's prespective...,"I was very disappointed in this book.The drawings in this book are very American-anime looking. They have large eyes, small noses and the general idea, but the influence over it is just too American to fully convey the Japanese style. Also, the stunning colors that are used in Japanese animation are lacking from the colored images in the book. They are very block and, well, American-anime looking. They attempt to describe different Japanese-character personalities as well and, in my opinion, do so quite poorly. Anime characters usually have little quirks about them that make them unique and lovable, and this book makes them appear very one-sided. It even describes distinctly American personalities that are rare in actual anime.If one is searching for this type of book, I would recommend searching a bit harder for Japanese imported books. They would be much more helpful if anime is what you're aiming for."
3,If you can only get one book,"Most of the Reviews are close to the mark. What I didn't like was a lack of ""step by step"" Drawing instructions ( Which, to be honest, is missing in a lot of ""how to draw magna"" style books). What I did like is that Hart covered a wide range of genres and presents what it is that makes magna ""manga"". Why three stars? While It's good solid book, I would have like more tutorials, IMHO."
1,Emerson Maui Bay tropical ceiling fans,"If you like the looks fine but dont buy this item for keeping cool.I bought 5 for my new home and removed all of them as they dont push air like they should and are heavy with a bulky motor,not to mention very expensive.Emerson fails to mention,except written on the box that the brushed Stainless isnt recomended for Outdoor use yet it is advertised so.they are decorative but living in HOT South Florida they arent very good at keeping a 12 foot high ceiling home cool.We did stay with Emerson and Buy the Advant Eco wich is wonderful,6 speeds and will blow you away.These fans are for looks only,from experience,never buy a 3 speed ceiling fan which is what these are and EXPENSIVE!!I put them in my rentals with 8 foot ceilings so I didnt lose any money"
5,Movie music at its best,"For the beginning of Star Wars in 1977 until the 1990's, few movies outside of those scored by John Williams had soundtracks that could be considered great orchestral music. Then came movies like Willow, Dragonheart, Gladiator and then the Lord of the Rings movies. Great original soundtracks now became more common. After the LOTR trilogy, maybe the best soundtrack this decade is that from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. This one-CD sampler contains most of the key pieces from all three movies, and is a great buy. The sound and orchestration is all but indistinguishable from that heard in the movies. The melodies are rich, the keys are spot on, and the price is quite good considering that each of the individual movie soundtracks sell for similar prices. Also a plus is the cover insert. It gives a brief overview of how the POTC ride became the POTC movie; and how the music composers were chosen. Overall, a great buy."
4,Fantastic Product,"This is by far the best polish on the market - bar none. A bit expensive, but it works really well and absolutely does not scratch! It works well on silver and chrome items, and I have even used it to remove stains on stainless steel cookware. Not only does it take off normal tarnish and oxidation, but I have also used to take off rust stains. One word of advice, always use a micro fiber cloth when using this to insure no scratching. Do not use paper towels or other types of cloth."
5,The Really Fun Family Haggadah,We read the Haggadah over and we think this will be the best year for your seder yet. My childern are 8 and 5. The older one reads hebrew the younger is able to sing the songs. We are looking forward to sharing this new family tradition with extened family and friends.
1,Absolutely useless,"You can think of buying this book if ( and only if ) you haven't even heard about SQL, relational DBs, HTTP and server side java. If you have even a beginner level knowledge of any topic above you won't find any new info in this book: it's extremely shallow. One of the worst technical books I've ever seen ( there was nothing to read )."
4,The lovestory combined with the island intrigue made for a very good read.,"I pulled this one from my TBR because is suited several of my ongoing reading challenges. Garron finds Zanthia to be a breath of fresh air with her honesty and bravery. Brought together because of Zanthia's family history on the island and his job to land survery the island's interior, they find themselves caught up in the islanders disputes. The lovestory combined with the island intrigue made for a very good read.Love's Ransom by Dana James~ Harlequin Romance #3068 ~ August 1990From the back cover...Something odd was happening on the islandZanthi could sense it--and she was troubled. Normally she enjoyed her diplomatic work as assistant secretary to Jumelle's Government House-- but the unexpected arrival of land surveyor Garran Crossley only added to her unease.Her hard-won calm erupted into outrage, however, when she realized she'd been delegated to travel the jungle interior with Garran!"
4,"Well thought out, intelligent and insightful.","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, written by current CSULA professor. Even for those not studying psychology, this book is easy to understand and insightful. I definitely recommend this book."
5,Do you wanna dance?? Buy this one!,"Antarctica returns with one of his best mixes ever. Great beats, rythyms, and sounds to make even the exeperienced dancer get out of the chair and groove like never before!"
5,The Meaning Is in the Telling,"Gabriel's Fire tells a story that is interesting and revelatory. But for me, reading it was a unique experience because its message is delivered through the use of acculturated dialogue, or, better, dialogues.From chapter to chapter, the style and level of usage bespeaks the setting in which a given dialogue occurs. In one chapter the protocols of a teacher-student exchange convey the impression of a classroom setting. In another, the narrative adopts the monosyllabic style of street-corner ragging to echo the author's sense of personal provocation. The author grew up in several different worlds, and he uses the distinctive discourse of each to authenticate his relationship to it and to the stories he is telling.Underlying the voices of his personae, I think, is the force of a single, self-possessed mind/soul of a young man with passion which is anchored in truth seeking and truth telling."
5,Great Book,"I really enjoyed this book. As someone who grew up in Chicago around the same time, it's a realistic portrayal of life on the South Side. Some may complain about all of the profanity used. I say, hide in a corner and listen to teens talk. As a matter of fact, don't hide, they'll probably swear anyway.The alcohol abuse, violence and love of music is a very real aspect of many people's lives. Even the affair with the teacher is well-done and not sensationalized.This is a must read for anyone interested in what life is or was like for some young people in our American cities."
1,"Interesting Story, poorly conveyed","I bought this book because I enjoy reading life stories, especially if it is about mexican/latino life. I just could not get into this book, so I didn't bother to finish it. The story just didn't seem to tie together or flow. I think the premise was a good start but it should be rewritten."
2,Mediocre,"The potato brush does the job ok, it is just too pricey for what you get here - a plastic brush with plastic bristles - nothing special from what I can tell. Saw one in store recently that was much sturdier & less money, wish I had waited & bought that one. Sorry to be negative, but just saying it like it is."
5,Another Great Anthology By MZ Bradley,"Tenth in the fantasy anthology series, you will enjoy this just as much as the first. Many great stories by familiar authors and some newbies. Another Shin'a'in story where the story's subjects are ""blessed"" by a ""good luck"" medallion and another story where the helpless rape victim is not what she seems. If you like fantasy or sword & sorcery, you'll love the series of short stories about women warriors, women swordsmen and sorceress plus the occasional ordinary woman. One of my fav stories is about a shape shifter who is a rabbit and is embarrassed until she is thrown into a situation where rabbit skills excel!"
5,i wish i was at the show,"this dvd captures really well(for a punk vid) this greatconcert-any fan of gbh or even hardcore will probably get into it. the bonus tracks on mine are cool too. so splurge and you too can see gbh going off, hardcore style."
5,Perfect,"Worked well. Simple easy, Do It Youself install and it looks great! Would recommend. Dont pay someone to do this, you can do it with this kit."
4,What we want is a retrospective box set!!!!,"This one seems to continue in the formula of releases in the past 12 years, that is a couple of covers, a remake of an old classic, and 4-5 new tunes. These guys really shine on the ballads and there are several new ones on here that stand up to their best stuff. Ernie and Earl Cate are two of the greatest songwriters of our time, and also two of the most under recognized songwriters of our time. If someone could produce ""The Songs of the Cate Brothers"" and round up Bonnie Raitt, Allman Brothers, and others to cover their greatest songs, these guys might finally get the recognition they truly deserve. I will volunteer to produce such a project. Do I have a backer who believes this music should be shared with the world? Keep on keepin' on brothers......"
4,no red extention tube.,"Mine did not come with the red extention tube. I will use the tube off the old can I had...I did get a great price though, so no complaints about that."
3,Air in a Can,"Great deal if you use Amazon Prime; however I had to give it 3 stars because it didn't come with the respective -red ""extension tube""."
3,With free shipping this product is okay,"This product is okay but does not represent a good value unless you can get it with free shipping and/or on sale. Otherwise, you are better off trying to find it locally."
3,NOT SUITABLE FOR CAMERAS,"Wish this was mentioned on the product description, but the canister itself mentions this.I have other uses for this, so won't rate it poorly. If you only need it for blowing dust around this will do just fine.For the price it is not worth the hassle of sending it back."
3,Some of bones are a little short.,"My dog loves the chews, as we call them, but some of the packages we order via the internet are short of the fill and very hard to chew for the dog. A little more quality control might be a good idea."
5,Does what it says,This is the second time I have bought one of these transformers. Very speedy delivery. Both do exactly what is needed. I can completely recommend this product. Need I say more?
1,Power Bright VC200W,"I needed a transformer that was rated at 2 amps and could step up a 100V input to 120V. This transformer will not do that. It's too expensive to ship this back to America since I'm in Japan...oh well, it will make an expensive doorstop."
1,Not working fine,"First i got it, it was bent at one of the case corner. But i let it go. Since it looked like still working anyway. But when i use it for 80 w hair curling device, it kept blowing the fuse. It said can be used for 200w. Thats the thing i bought it for, so useless. Im too lazy to deal with return and get money back."
4,Power Bright VC200W Voltage Transformer,The product did exceed my expectations. For an step-up transformer this product is ideal. The fact that it was so inexpensive was very impressive. Excellent value.
3,"it works, but connection has became loose","again, i am using it and everything goes well, but after the connection has became loose (it unplugs by itself if you just touching the electrical plug)."
1,Fuses All Blew Immediately!,"I got this product to power an appliance purchased in China for use in the USA. After reading the instructions and setting it up correctly to power 220 volt product with our 110 volt US power, I turned it on. The fuse blew instantly. Fortunately there were 2 spares (I thought). They also blew instantly. Now I have to try to find some decent fuses. The product has not worked for me at all. I cannot recommend this one at all."
4,Pretty Good Except for One Minor Issue,"I am writing this review about two months after purchasing this converter and notice that apparently the device has completely changed from the one I purchased in December. The converter I purchased appears more like the VC-100 or VC-300 rather than the one currently pictured with the same model number.I purchased the VC200W in December 2011 for a trip to Europe. While on my trip I hooked it up to a small power strip and charged a couple of my portable devices at the same time. It worked great but be aware it is pretty heavy and adds significantly to the total weight of your luggage. Of course if your not close on your max luggage weight this won't be a problem. One other issue, if you carry it in your carry on luggage, it almost always raises the interest of airport security and caused me to go through a manual inspection a couple of times."
4,Glad I bought this!,"It was the first time I bought an expensive electronic device from the US for use in Asia. As such I was very worried that the transformer would not be able to perform as described, and that the device would be damaged. To my delight, the transformer did a good job, and did not even feel hot to the touch - just a little warm. I charged my electronic device overnight and still the transformer merely felt warm to the touch. Now my electronic device is up and running, ande I'm really pleased with the purchase."
5,Excellent Transformer,Excellent Transformer for people wanting to use European 220V Electric products.Surprisingly compact and relatively light for its Power Capacity...Good value for money.I would buy it again and would recommend it to others with no reservations.
5,good product.,i am using this for one month now without any problem.its a good product under the cost.also it does not heat up too much.
2,Fused Burned,After testing it and attempting to run my xbox 360 that was bought in Asia. Every 5 min it would burn out one of the Fuse... Whats up with that?
5,"If you like soothing, gentle piano music, this is for you!","It is the perfect music to play when relaxing by the fire. Very soothing, remarkable piano... Truly a delight to listen to!"
4,"bottom stem, great grinder",Our son gave us this grinder. I changed the nut and the stem. Put in a lock washer for a couple of years. Took it off. Now the nut moves too much again..
5,nice piece of machinery,"i bought the perfex pepper mill several years ago with a gift card- a frivolous purchase i might not have made with cash out of my pocket. i liked it so much, i came back to buy the matching salt mill with cash out of my pocket.i like these for three reasons- firstly, they work perfectly. I hate cheap tools that barely work, so these are a pleasure to use. secondly, because they are built well, i expect they will be working perfectly for decades. thirdly, they're a beautiful, timeless design. they sit by the cooktop when I'm cooking, and they come right to the table with me for meals."
2,Effective but to expensive.,These mills work but are way to expensive for the value provided. Classic design and great counter appeal however I dont think they work any better than far more reasonably priced mills. My wife can not turn the pepper mill as the handle is to small to get leverage. They look great but are they worth it..dont think so.
4,Great wireless adapter,"Works great, has good range and it is easy to setup. Do not need to pay high prices for N wireless. The ISP only gives me 4-5 Mbits max and a 108 Mbit G device is more than enough with fewer compatibility issues."
2,Not as effective as external cards,I bought the Intel pro card to replace my external wireless card. The Internal Intel pro wireless card is ineffective since it keeps losing connectivity and signal strength. Hence I have inactivated it and have been using the external NETGEAR wireless card.
4,"Good format, informative","This is a very good book for even the experienced reloader. It's data format is the best I have seen, very easy to read and is well layed out. The only area it is lacking is it's load data is relativly limited, i suggest purchasing the lyman 4th edition book along with this book."
4,Great book! Could be better.,"I read this book from cover to cover and found it extremely informative and detailed in almost all aspects of this hobby. However, I felt it should have had a color shotshell identification section. Otherwise, it was great reading."
4,Reloading for shotgunners,"Good introductory book for shotgun shell reloading.For powders and loads, I would buy a more advanced book."
2,bigger isn't always better,"I appreciate that this book has a listing of all of the obscure desserts from the last thirty years. However some of them should have been lost. Some of the directions are quite detailed on plate presentation but vague when it comes to the execution of the item. My other pet with this book is the lack of consistency in portion size. But can someone tell me what is the deal with the pigs? For the professional borrow someonelse's, for the novice walk away, for the scientist; good luck cause not all of the recipes have worked. A Professional Pastry Chef and staff."
3,Great food - Awful Measurements,"This beautiful book covers almost everything you need to know about bread making and deserts. However, be prepared to spend 15 minutes to one half hour converting measurements into teaspoons, tablespoons, half cups, etc. To add to the confusion, one pound of flour equals four cups but one pound of bread flour equals four and one half cups. Figgure that one out. Also, the book is designed for a professional restaurant kitchen. For instance: Bo tells us to mix the bread dough with the dough hook. I find it easier to mix it with the paddle, a bit at a time and finish with the hook."
4,Beautiful but difficult.,"Although, this is not a book for beginners, it is a very well written and beautifully illustrated book for professionals and skilled cooks. Everything I have made from it is very good and the large (usually 16) servings are usually fairly easy to reduce to a family size or can be adapted. My one complaint, and I consider it important, is the fact that there is no system for matching illustrations with recipes. One can find a photo and then look in the index for the recipe but to find the illustration for a recipe, one must leaf through the illustration pages, a real pain, especially in a book as large as this."
1,"True it is the worst , But","If it is a have to half, he will be rissuing this album and 3 of his earlier works in 2003. (Info found on the new CD.I've just heard Cd 1 of the new release ""Je Nous Aime""ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT It's a must have already"
1,Lover Dose By Claude Challe,"One of the worst compilation in the Buddha Bar & Claude Challe series.It is over priced , out of print and hard to find. They stop printing it cause they realized what an awful compilation it is. It's hard to find cause whomever owned it they tossed it out of the window. The first CD is labeled ""Seduction"" It will put the Seducer and Seducee both to sleep. The second CD is called "" Action"": the only action that it generates is to get up and run to your CD player get the Lover Dose CD , run outside play freesbee with it.What a waste of money"
3,Not the best -- not the greatest,"Griffin spends a lot of time arguing his stance and not enough discussing the definitions and concepts that his stance is based on. He does explain the research in nice detail but I kept thinking that learning theory explains the same behaviors he is describing without reference to conscious awareness and so the arguments don't fully make it for me. Minds of Their Own by Rogers is better but I still found this book (Animal Minds) better than Species of Mind which was way to hard to read -- I came away with no knew knowledge from reading Species of Mind. To sum I'd say it's worth reading for sure but only if you intend to also read Mind's of Their Own. They compliment each other nicely because Griffin describes more detail in the research while Rogers discusses the arguements and definitions better.James O'Heare, Dip.C.B."
1,Do NOT Read This Book,"Do not read this book. I attempted to read this book for a college class. This book should be cut down to the size of a magazine article and be published in a scientific journal. The public should not be misled into thinking that this book is readable. It is written at too high of a diction, and Griffin rambles on for 20 pages on one topic, which I won't spoil for those of you unfortunate to read this trash. The subject information is interesting, but this is written poorly, and will bore the reader to tears. Just thought I'd let you all know."
3,Good selections with one exception,"This is a pretty good collection of Connie's songs. Too bad the audio breaks up on ""What The World Needs Now"". That is a disappointment. I would pass because of this. There's many other collections of hers you should get instead. Of course only one has ""What The World Needs Now"" and it's up there in price. If you have the Bacharach and David album keep that instead of getting this. This could have been an outstanding collection in conjunction with Vol. 1 otherwise. By the way the sound on Vol. 1 is fine."
4,It's Nice,"Delivered on time and it holds a cold beer. Does exactly what they say ""Keeps your drinks cold and your hands warm."" Happy with the graphics as well better than some koozies I've had. Wish the bottom was sold or sowed but the base is glued on. I've had other koozies like this and the base always seems to separate over time. I have other koozies that are one piece or sowed and have had absolutely no problems with them. Was hoping this was the same as those but who knows maybe this one will hold together. Other than that I'm happy with it."
3,Not up to mark,"This book is more theoretical than a pratical book, only IAC componects are disscussed not any other internet technologies. the only samples discussed in this book are those which come as SAMPLES with IACs"
3,PITA to mount,"I had two problems, I ordered the brass finish and the one I received looks like copper. It doesn't look bad, just not what I expected. The other thing is they include period correct brass or copper slotted screws for mounting. Slotted screws are impossible to use with a power screwdriver and I finally gave up and used three philips head wood screws.Otherwise it works great and I am happy with the thermometer."
5,GRRRRREAT,"WELL BUILT, BEAUTIFUL DESIGN, WORKS GREAT AND LARGE FACE. HAVE PURCHASED BEFORE FROM CONANT BRASS ALWAYS QUALITY PRODUCTS... THANK YOU..."
1,I Would Give This Zero Stars if I Could,"This themometer does not give an even close temperature reading. If it's 30 degree F out side, it will read 50. Right now it's 32 outside and the thermometer is reading 42. I have had this product replace twice as well as recalibrating it on my own once. My $10 themometer from Home Depot is more accurate. Do not spend the over $70 - it is far from worth it!"
5,The best when you are learning macroeconomics,"Is a very interesting book, specially for people who are studing in Latin America, like me."
2,Poorly Written and Unclear,"Obviously patched together from topics written over a period of time, this book is not cohesive nor understandable. Mills doesn't spend any words developing his topics nor explaning the development. Spend your resources on Hamilton's classic and great definative bible, Time Series Analysis instead."
2,"Too little, too expensive...","I take a statin drug for cholesterol.Apparently CoQ10 helps with some of the side effects.Well, shortly after purchasing a bottle of these softgels my doctor also recommended CoQ10, but a minimum of 600 mg per day. That would be 20 capsules. No thanks. I think I'll look for some larger capsules."
5,1960s research revised for 21st century Africa,"Priceless examples of indigenous languages and oral culture; no DRM and CC license makes it easy to browse, data-mine and share. Makes me wish I were teaching again for the wealth of material it makes available for scholarship and class-use, even for K-12."
5,You need to study Esther!,"Last summer I did this bible study with a small group of friends. I chose this study because none of us knew much about Esther. We had a wonderful time! The weekly amount of homework was just right, and 8 lessons fit into the summer perfectly. We all felt like we really knew Esther by the end of the 8 weeks - her strengths and weaknesses. And we could identify with both. We saw that we can be used by the Lord in spite of our imperfections and even wrong choices. Dee Brestin brought out truths and insights that I would have just read right over. The questions asked in the book led my group into some great discussions. Bottom line was that it was a time for us to grow closer to the Lord and to eachother - the perfect way to spend the summer."
3,so-so,"The art work is hard to read, the type is computer set and sometimes is too small. It would have been nice if more attention was paid to craft, the visual storytelling is just so so. I would check it out in a comic shop, not buy it."
1,"Inaccurate, ""politcally correct"" view of Bligh","From the Hollywood types, William Bligh has come down to us as the epitome of tyrants, a man who got what he deserved in the Bounty incident. Although Bligh certainly did a poor job in his handling of his subordinates during the Bounty expedition, including choosing a personal friend, Fletcher Christian, as first mate, he had a long and distinguished career. His voyage in an open boat thousands of miles, bringing those men who remained loyal to him to Timor and safety, is one of the true great adventures of history. While not a perfect leader, he was certainly better than the pathetic creature that Mr. Collett makes him out to be....."
1,sucks,i put this on my truck and within a week it wiggled itself loose. althought it looks cool after it fell off i no longer use it
5,"floral, fruity & fun!","I really like this scent from Samba. It's floral, fruity and fun. Uplifting. Great for casual, daily wear."
3,Word Circus,"Word Circus is a wonderfully entertaining look at the English language. The cartoon illustrations are a great addition. Well worth a look if you are interested in the many different ways the English language can be used to amuse, or confuse."
3,The Tenth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition,"The Pianists' performance in final round is excellent, but this DVD and some of the contestants are not charm in performing and characters. The DVD is not so interesting compared to the Eight and the Ninth and the Eleven's Van Cliburn Competition. The worst in my view is the Twelve, the vedeo picture angle is not interesting and the contestents do not have much of warm feeling."
3,Very little torque,"Great for normal nut not much tighter than finger tight, under carriage panels and the likes. I would say it will do 15ft lbs of torque max."
3,Not 130 ft-lbs buyer beware.. Looks to be fixed now.,"Just sent back this tool, this website lists the foot pound rating at 130 as of 6-23-2010, on the back of the package the real rating of 75ft-lbs is revealed.Needless to say was disappointed and have now moved on to the Ingersoll Rand 216 Butterfly impact.Problem Resolved, rating increased from 2-3 stars accordingly."
5,"A classic southern hymn book, with shape notes","I bought this book by mail from WCKY radio over 50 years ago, but lost it about 10 years ago. It has all the old favourites, ""Angel Band"", ""Whispering Hope"", ""I'll Fly Away"", etc. I'm very happy to have it back."
2,"Yikes, ugly projects!","I was disappointed with the appearance of the projects. The demonstration examples are not very attractive. It is difficult to find a project that would be fun to build yet serve a purpose. Didn't we really build all the trivets and bread boxes we would ever need in high school shop? And I think you wife will leave if you make her the china cabinet they outline here. I do like the entry way mirror that I got from this book. These are projects for the limited workshop, but they are very crude. If I had browsed through this book I would not have made the purchase."
1,I'm frustrated with this book,"The projects look nice and seem like something you can do with limited tools, but I found the tri-fold picture frame to be nearly impossible and almost dangerous to build without a table saw and router table. For one thing, the pieces are way too small to clamp safely. This could be an isolated example but I for one don't trust this book. I think it was written to frustrate people into buying more tools, preferably black & decker's."
5,Finally!,"Finally Mr. Murphy has provided us with yet more reading pleasure. Finally there is an original author out there who knows how to research a subject before daning to write about it. Finally the reading public is provided with true reading pleasure, with intelligent action and gut-wrenching newness of style. Finally, someone who can paint with words and fill our minds with fresh pictures and ideas.Now there is something new to look forward to reading. I can't wait for the next one, Mr. Murphy."
2,Reads like a poorly done Dirk Pitt wanna-be,"I read the book and kept getting the impression that the writer was trying to pull off a Dirk Pitt type novel... and failing. The character's were never really developed, the Naitaka who are suppose to be mysterious and hardly ever seen are all over the place, and there was too much coincidence for me with the lead character happening to look for the 'monster' at the exact time he would be most likely be able to find one."
5,Tom Slick meets Tom Clancy,"I could barely put this one down. A great read from Lee Murphy who is certainly getting the hang of this ""novel"" business.Naitaka is a blend of high-tech monster hunting and gripping characters. You'll be dying to find out what happens next and incredulous when you do! Naitaka's not for the faint-of-heart. There's enough action to keep the most avid reader of thrillers occupied. And there's plenty of excellent information that helps lay the groundwork for those not familiar with the subject of cryptozoology.Don't miss this second installment in the Kodiak Books. Kodiak will certainly grow on you and who knows where Lee will have him jaunting off to next... Do I hear big footsteps coming through an equatorial swamp? ;)Read Naitaka and keep an eye out for the next of the ""Kodiak Books"". Better by a long-shot than any fiction I've read in a while."
1,"Wrong Size, useless",It is not long enough to be used on a sawmill or hackzall.the end of the blade hits ground and is near impossible to control.
3,Funnier Than I Thought,"This movie is not a bad indie movie at all, picture quality ain't the greatest but it has some funny parts. Master P captures the hood supaman in a pretty good way and would recommend this movie if you are looking for a good laugh. Movie also comes with free soundtrack but it only contains 9 songs but they are also good."
3,Blast from the past if you grew up in the 80's,"Guy who had a crush on a girl in high school meets her again some years later and is trying to impress her and not being himself, he has the great job, expensive car when really he doesn't. he works at suncoast video. they go to a party with his sister and his best friend, some crazy things happen and at the end everything works out. kinda typical, not much of a comedy. some unnessary scenes and crude dialogue but the two main charectors the guy and the girls chemestry make up for some of its shortcomings. its better than some of tastless comedies out there right now."
3,Great Soundtrack for A Movie,"My niece came over and we watched it together. It was a fun movie and my husband came out to tell me he could hear us laughing from three rooms away. Mostly, we enjoyed the awkwardness that Topher seems to pull off with complete ease. Personally, I loved the soundtrack. Age old story of awkward guy longing for girl out of his league. Now he and his twin sister, Fat, annoying, friend Barry come up with a scheme for him to ""get"" the girl. Funny enough. Sex, drugs, stealing, lying, covered. Not much else to say other than If you are an 80's nostalgia fan, you will enjoy it."
1,A really horrible movie when you consider it's billed as a comedy...,Anna Ferris doesn't even appear in anything close to resembling the hair/makeup/wardrobe shown in the poster. This is more a drama than comedy and it's not all that compelling. I think the leads did it for a paycheck!
5,Another Awesome Trip Back to the 80's!!!,"Last year, we got Hot Tub Time Machine. This year, we get Take Me Home Tonight. It has a nostalgic vibe and it has a great storyline about being true to yourself. It's not laugh-out-loud comedy, but it does have a few hilarious moments. It doesn't over-use sex, but they did have a lot of drugs, especially cocaine. Topher Grace stars as Matt, a guy who doesn't know what to do with his life. His sister, Wendy sent her application to a college, and Matt's friend, Barry just got fired from his job. Matt works at the local video store, and his high school crush, Tori comes in. She tells him that Kyle is throwing a wild party and asks him to come. Throughout the wild and crazy night, Matt tries to get Tori to like him. This is a really fun movie to watch. I highly recommend that you TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT!!!"
4,"Great movie, funny. Loved it.","I love the 80's even though I was born in the 90's and I thought this movie was great. I saw it at a premier at Penn State where Topher and Teresa Palmer (the blonde) showed up. They took questions after and discussed how they wanted to do an 80's film that didn't insult the 80's....They got it right, the soundtrack and atmosphere is perfect.The people who say this film sucked were obviously pissed that they didn't make a Woodstock film, or that Topher didn't do a ""Tha 70's Show"" movie. It's a real shame this movie bombed (in sales) at the theaters."
5,More people need to see this excellent movie!,"So I don't normally write reviews as I figure if I am going to go to that effort I should put it on my own site. I am writing my very first Amazon review for one reason, to urge others to discover this movie. It really didn't get the promotion that many inferior comedies receive which is a shame. I describe it as the feeling of Risky Business with a similar plot to Superbad... if Superbad was post-college rather than post-high school. I think a few comparisons to Can't Buy Me Love and Can't Hardly Wait could also be drawn. I don't want to go into major plot points, as it is best to watch it for yourself. I am a major movie buff (have seen at least 20 films this year in theaters) but this is my favorite movie of 2011 (as of this writing 7/11/11). I am pre-ordering this movie now as I can't wait to watch it again and to show it to all my friends that didn't happen upon it in theaters."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I did not want to see this movie, because it really seemed like just another film about people being idiots at a party, and that's pretty much what it was, with two major exceptions. First, it was set in 1984, and it was really cool to see the lengths they went to, to keep everything as accurate as they could. Second, both Topher Grace and Anna Faris were a breath of fresh air. It's hard to bring anything new to a film like this, which is evident by characters like Dan Fogler's, which was stale and predictable. Grace and Faris on the other hand really had great chemistry and add a unique dynamic to the typical drunken loser genre. Take Me Home Tonight isn't going to win any awards, but it was a lot more entertaining than I thought it would be."
3,"MOVIE OK, CASE and INNER PAPER IN POOR CONDITION","I wish the outer parts were in better condition; the movie looked fine. Also, it took awhile to get to me. All in all I got what I paid for."
2,Well.,"I'm not usually one to complain, but maybe you should consider a disclaimer stating that the blu ray will not come in its original packaging. Disappointed."
2,Pretty awful,"I grew up during the 80s, so I was eager to see this one. Okay, so there's some awesome period music, the gigantic hairdos and the shoulder-padded jackets, all very well. Worth one star. And I like Topher Grace, I really do -- star number 2. Oh but the plot! This movie is one big mess. It seems to have two basic messages: You're going to have fun when you're on coke, and if you want to be somebody, do something really, really stupid. There is, however, no coherent narrative, no consistent characterization, and no compelling storyline. If you want to see Topher Grace, watch That 70s Show instead, which is truly awesome (at least during the first few seasons)."
1,Less Than Zero...Stars,"This movie is the absolute armpit. It has no sense of the decade it's supposed to be capturing. A record store has a Madonna poster from 1985 alongside one of Guns 'N' Roses from 1988. The music is all over the map. I guess the makers thought that any music released between 1980 to 1989 would suffice. I assume that the principal characters are post college grads but they all look like they are in their thirties. There's no discernible plot or character to care about. It commits the cardinal sin of making Anna Faris unattractive. Tolerance of the noxious Dan Fogler is like walking on hot nails. The script has it's basis on a story(?) by star Topher Grace. Topher, go back to ""That Seventies Show"" if you want to comment on a decade you have no firsthand knowledge about. If you want to check out some decent Eighties nostalgia rent ""Hot Tub Time Machine""."
4,wow,wow. i love the undertones of this film. it's the subtleties that make it great. i wasn't too big a fan of the typical cliche romantic courtship...but it did hit a few notes i'm sure we can all relate to. it's one of those comedies that isn't really laugh out loud funny...but the story and message is great. i definitely recommend.
1,40 min. in and waiting for the movie to start!,This movie was so bad and it mad me HATE Topher Grace and I like Topher.It was porly shot... It was Norm Macdonald Bad!
2,Not Good.,"Enough said. Saw this movie ahead of time at a free screening in Boston, and I'm glad I didn't shell out $12 to see it. While the story and characters were mildly endearing, overall, anyone can see why this was a flop at the box office. The inconsistent plot line, the ridiculousness of Topher Grace, Anna Farris & Dan Fogler being a 22-year-olds, and the desperateness of a movie trying to scam off of the Superbad limelight all contributed to this movie belly flopping into obscurity. As an advocate of strong chicks in film, the female leads in this movie failed to impress me. Farris' character had so much potential to be cool, it was difficult to picture her with the jock-dude antagonist to whom she is supposedly engaged. Saving the movie were the likability of Grace as the protagonist and some funny awkward scenes with Fogler (an obvious Jonah Hill-ripoff-type character) while at a crazy party involving cocaine. Final rating: 2/5"
2,slightly interesting: good to waste a lazy day.,"I thought this book would be cool. I hoped it would. I'm anidiot. The story itself is not at fault. Every two or three pagesthere is a reference to some type of sexual activity that has absolutely no bearing on the story.Other than that, you have an interesting little haunted house story. however, I would have titled the book ""The Horny Haunt.""Mr. williamson, if you ever read this, less sex please, unless it is important."
1,"Terrible, one of the worst books I've ever read","I bought this waste of paper a month ago and I'm only halfway through it. It just keeps getting worse, I've made it a game now to see just how awful it can get by the end. The character Rachel is about the stupidest woman I've ever read about. If you've read this, you'll know what I mean. And why do writers (this isn't the only author guilty of this) think that annoyingly precocious 8-10 year olds make good characters? Nick is 8 and reading philosophy books and supposedly understanding them! Give me a kid that adores Spiderman comics and Hot Wheels instead of detestably bright brats. Don't waste your money on this book, none of the characters are likable, the plot is laughably bizarre, and it's badly written. If the rest of Williamson's books are like this I suggest he go back to 10th grade creative writing class."
5,"Articulate, meaningful, surprising","Leave it to grandmaster J. N. Williamson to breathe new life and originality into the ghost story.Williamson's work never fails to satisfy. He writes with grace and authority and a style on his own. This novel, and its climax, will remain with you long after reading the book."
2,"by an economist, for an economist","as an amateur economist grown increasingly dissatisfied w/ the failures of available theories, i was hopeful that this book would expound more on why markets fail. in some ways it did (in a very drab and boring language), although its coverage of financial markets (my interest) was all too brief and incomplete---the coverage of losers' outperformance of winners in equities was by far (IMHO) the best section of the book, but as good as that section was, the coverage of foreign exchange fluctuations was a failure. ---soros did a much better job of this.there is some good material in this book, and i would give it 3 stars as a result, but the writing style makes it simply too inaccessible for the average reader. better financial market focus can be found in ""reminisces of a stock operator"" and ""alchemy of finance"", which really were accidental breakthroughs in behavioral finance (particularly the former--a gem of a book).rhyno"
4,Solid knife,Loved the knife the blade and handle construction is excellent. Was really happy with the blade size and shape. Will make a good utility knife. Bought one as a gift and got one for myself. I took off one star because of scratches on the handle. They came in a box wrapped in plastic but the handle made it appear used.
1,A disappointment,"The face of the watch is large and easy to read. So one would expect the watch would be designed with a date that is also easy to read. The date is so small, I was not able to read it. I had to pay to have a magnifying glass glued to the watch face in order to read the date. It is too bad they chose to make the date so small because the watch itself is very good."
1,Lousy ending.,One of my favoarite actors and the movie is good until the ending. Not my kind of entertainment.
5,Read the most critical reviews... Ignore them and buy the comic,"Yes, you could wait for the one in colour.Yes, it has cheap binding, the spine of which may break if you are not careful.Yes, it has thin paper and sometimes you can see through to the other side of the sheet.But buy and read it nonetheless. I had never read bone before. I only bought it because of the reviews on Amazon. I wasn't disappointed at all. It is an engrossing tale, that I finished in two days flat (Imagine 1300 pages of comics) during the work week.There is social commentary, and it is a fairy tale setting and there is the sunset...If you like comics, you will like this.PS: To the one reviewer who said, he was 22 and he was too old for this. I'm 29 and thoroughly enjoyed the comic."
4,"Great comic, good product minus paper too thin","No need to say anything more about Bone, it is inventive and a must read.Let's talk about the book.Inking is great, blacks are blackPapaer is really white and hold well.The only problem would be that the paper is a bit too thin, and sometimes you see the pictures fo the prvious or next page by transparency.This is the only thing you can say that is wrong about this edition, because the book is very well made, well printed, the spine holds well too and the whole book, more than 1300 pages thick, is a big beast."
4,Great Stuff,"After buying two, and then two more, BONE books for my kids for the holidays, and watching them both devour the stories, I started looking to complete the set. Unfortunately, of the 9 color compilation books, several (particularly in the latter going) are quite hard to find. So... this.PROS: You get the whole incredible story, start to finish. Good times had by all. Wonderful art, great storytelling and humor.CONS: At 1332 pages plus a couple, it's not much smaller than a cinderblock, and hernias are a potential factor in carrying it around. Plus (and not to sound heretical) I was disappointed to find that it is NOT IN COLOR - something I didn't know when ordering it. Nothing against the artwork, but the coloring in the individual books is so wonderful that it does make things feel more complete as an experience. However, it didn't seem to affect my kids. Plus if it WERE in color, you'd likely be looking at a 50% higher pricetag or more."
4,Bone,this is a great book and it's great to have it in one volume.The only problem is that its black and white.had I known it was a black and white edition I would have bought the books and not the one volume addition.
5,A great Graphic Novel,"This collection is on many people's lists of must have graphic novels, if that isn't enough to make you buy this then the stories will!"
3,Spring for Bone in separate volumes,"Fives stars for the story, two stars for this particular edition. This collected volume is cost effective, but I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known:1) It weighs four pounds (I weighed it). My son took this to school with him for a week or two, and that was absolutely ridiculous. Just holding it up to read in bed is heavy for me.2) It's black and white. The individual volumes are color.The story is wonderful, and perfect for young readers. I gave up and bought the separate volumes even though we had invested in this collection."
5,Bone: An Heroic Epic in Comic Form,"Bone is a comic for any who love style similar to Walt Kelly or want Tolkien's Lord of the Rings with irreverent wit and humor strewn throughout. A work of great comic book art (the pictures tell a thousand words) with snappy jokes and an amazingly well-crafted tale of epic proportions, this one-volume collection delivers time and time again. I found myself reading this (instead of my homework readings) in between classes, the moment I got home from school, and every free chance I got. Well worth purchasing if you like an intriguing tale of good vs. evil, humor, or comics in general."
4,Pre-teen book,"A good book for pre-teen boys. I bought this as a birthday gift for my 11 y.o. He wanted the series and this was an ""all in one"" so, good bargain for sure!"
5,so far so good,"half way through this giant book and it's getting pretty epic. thought the Black and White art style would throw me off, but it's actually really great and compliments the story very well."
3,Black and White?,"The drawings are black and white?! Sorry, that's a deal breaker. What's the point of getting a complete anthology if the color from the original books isn't used? Makes no sense."
4,Good book. Excellent value.,"I bought this at a convention without any familiarity with Bone. It was a good read and I loved the format. As a heads up to anyone thinking about getting this, they have just announced a color one volume collection. I'm sure it will be much more expensive, but now that it's been announced I'm sure I'll be tempted to get the color version and check it out how it was intended to be."
4,Fantasy lover will appreciate this book,I find this complete edition of Bone to be a book fashinating to look at and intriguing to read. It is what I was needing to get so I'm fully satisfied. Recommended.
3,Buy the color version,Bone is a great saga. My son and I are reading this black and white version because we did not want to spend the money for all the separate volumes which are in color and visually STUNNING.You get the story with this B&W; version buy miss a lot of the mood and drama that the color images bring. Seems like more of a children's story in B&W...still; it is a wonderful tale.
3,This volume is B&W,"If you like this series, you should know that this volume is printed completely in black & white, unlike the individual volumes which are printed in color. I think that would be significant to adults, but it's especially important to youngsters. My son was using his birthday money to buy this book and was hugely disappointed. He'll get the last couple of volumes in color instead."
3,meh,"its not bad. its an ok read, something you can share with the kids.... it also isnt very good... and alot of ideas seemed borrowed from other books."
5,My son LOVES this book!,"My son has been reading this book for two months, over and over again. I have to admit that I am enjoying the story (and artwork) too. He now has several of his friends hooked too, starting a ""Bone Club"" in his second grade class, and has (with some technical help) created word seach puzzles for his Club. I gave it five thumbs up because it not only helped my son rediscover reading. It's a good read AND it's a good reread."
3,Chiron: Healing Body & Soul (Astrology),"Anyone purchasing this book should have a natal chart made up with where or how the Astroid Chiron is in their chart or if they are a professional Astrologist. It explains how it effects you but only if you have the information to work with it from the natal chart, otherwise you might as well skip the purchase or give it away to someone who has the information to follow how it effects you."
5,Great Book!,"I had just purchased a boat exactly like this and I was looking for info. A web group refrenced me to this and I found a pot of gold. The text is easy to read and understand with plenty of photos. It's sprinkled with humor as well as advice on how to avoid some paths followed by the author. I highly recommend this to any one restoring or refurbishing a small trailer sailor, the information is universally applicable. Fair winds and following seas!"
2,Not a detailed how to book.,"Not a detailed book and unlike the advertised ""Everything you need to know to buy and restore a small sailboat on a shoestring"" the book glosses over much and lists other books and web sites to find the information you really need. But in fairness the book does give an overview of the restoration process which was helpful."
3,Shoestring?,Pretty average but effective general guide to refurbishment. Seems to start on most refurb areas but never seems to give any great detail. Primitive illustration but good general advice on how to keep a shoestring boat afloat and looking average.Good money saving advice for smallish weekender type trailer sailers.
4,"Great advice, poor accent","These best kept secrets aren't very well kept secrets, because I knew most of them already. I heard some of these secrets from other sources before I heard them from Peter Thomson. However, they are great communication skills and they do work. I just didn't like Peter Thomson's low-pitched English accent and voice very much. I found it hard to concentrate on what he was saying even when I was using some of his listening techniques. I had to turn the volume way up and the bass way down on my car stereo in order to digest what he was saying. Maybe his book would be better for me. Overall, it's a very good audio cd if you can stand to listen to it. (4.5 stars)"
3,dissapointed fan,"i bought this concent from amazon awile ago and was dissapointed, the case says dolby 5.1 but when i played it in my home theater system it came out in 2.o and there was no menu for me to adjust it,i wonder if anyone else has had this problem? other than that it was a great tesla concert and i would recommend it to any tesla fan."
4,Great show - great band - region 1 DVD,"The band and the show on this DVD are both great, make no mistake! All other reviewers have pointed that out, and I do not disagree at all.Two minor drawbacks make me give it only 4 out of 5 stars:1) contrary to the description on the amazon.com-page when I bought it, this is a region 1 DVD, which made it a bit hard for me as a european to view it. But I managed... ;-)2) there are a couple of interview sequences in the middle of the concert film, which I find a bit annoying. Why didn't they put those in the special features section, and just leave the concert film alone to be viewed as a complete concert?But those are minor drawbacks - if you're a fan of rock'n'roll, hard rock or anything guitar based: Don't miss out on this DVD!! Tesla ROCKS!"
5,Into The Now,"First Thanxx for Amazon.com..very fast delivery to Germany/Wuppertal!!!!Into the now , yes , they really arrived in 2008 with an inredible DVD.What a Show , a Sound , a Setlist...no Words!!! Buy-See-Cry-Enjoy.Saw them on june 14th this Year in Cologne/Germany...just a Small Club-Gig for about 150People!!! Really Greate!!! Couldnt wait for the Live-DVD and NOW it plays all day and night. One of the best Live-Bands i know and the DVD shows why!!Rock on...Alexander"
4,"Tesla....Weathered, but still rockin'!!","Tesla is one of the best bands to come out of the 80's. Their first three albums are essential!! This DVD shows that they haven't lost any of there intensity, even if the years have taken a toll. With all but one of the original members, the music is as good as it was when I saw them multiple times in the late 80's and early 90's. It sounds as though lead vocalist Jeff Keith is the weak link here. Maybe it was a bad night or towards the end of the tour, but his vocals sound pretty raw. He gets it done, but I found myself thinking he must be in pain trying to get each note out. I love Tesla and always will. I just think the vocals on this DVD could be better. Cool behind the scenes special features! Glad these guys are still around."
1,Band is awesome but Vocals are lacking big time!!!!!!,"This is a great DVD but unfortunately the Vocals are lacking big time. I put the DVD in and went right to my all time favorite song ""Modern Day Cowboy"" The band is killer but this is a case where the band needs to replace the lead singer with a sound alike from their glory days like Journey and Foreigner did.I didn't even make it through the entire song before I turned it off."
3,Tesla Lite,"This was hard to watch. Jeff's voice sounds like Cartman. He has something wrong with his vocal cords, and his voice starts to grate on your ears after 1/2 an hour. I know he was sick during the taping of this concert, but his voice is not much different when he is feeling well.Since Tommy was fired, the band sounds like a shadow of itself. The attitude and energy have shifted to the softer side. Tommy brought aggressive guitar playing and attitude. I have seen them 8 times in the last 5 years, and I notice a different vibe, since Tommy was booted. It's like eating a diet meal, it fills you up, but it's not satisfying.Dave Rude is good, but he is not Tommy."
5,Was at this show.....AMAZING,"Very long show, many songs, has to be over 2 hours worth. Jeff was spot on with the vocals, Frank was amazing as was the rest of the band of course. It's hard to believe they can still rock this hard after over 20 years. Finally we get an electric DVD!! Their new song is awesome (Dear Private Ledbetter). Can't wait for this to come out, there were at least 6 cameras so if the sound quality is good which im sure it will be, youre gonna be looking at a Tesla masterpiece!"
5,Bow to the might TESLA!,I have been waiting for tesla to finally put out a live concert DVD and after all the years of waiting I have to say it was well worth the wait. Telsa has a awesome sound and they are great live! Great job guys!!
4,"Great band, Slacker DVD authoring company","The 4 stars are for the band who deserve 5. These guys rock.The missing star if for whoever encoded the audio and ripped off the consumers. It is advertised as Dolby Digital 5.1, but the only audio channel on the DVD is Dolby 2.0."
3,telsa coming at you live,"great concert or i should say performance.but how about the fact that this is supposed to in 5.1 surroundbut it's not, i can't beleive no one has said anything on this.how i rate this dvd1. performance 5 stars2. video quality 3.5 stars3. audio quality 2 stars only because my receiver automaticaly puts it in simulated souround.over all rating 3how can anyone give this dvd 5 starswhen it's not in true 5.1 soround."
5,tesla still rocknroll,"Hey you tesla freaks...... this dvd is extremely well produced! Lots of killer bonus footage.... love this band... they played their guts out..... very entertaining..... must be honest, the singer struggles at times.... his voice wavers, shrills, ouch.... still phenomenal overall"
4,Mind-scrambling cacophony & catchy sweet pop,"Deerhoof throw together scratchy, crumbing, random noisescapes that spontaneously coalesce into sweet pop anthems- ""Polly Bee"" is the best example of this phenomenon, and may be the best song ever written, ever."
3,"Very, very noisy.","Let me start by saying that I LOVE this band! I first got The runners four and I was blown away, not only for the music but also for the heavyness and the power of the production value. So next was Reverie and it was kinda lo-fi but had great music. then Milk Man which probably is my fave, and Green Cosmos, both great music and production. This disc was almost unlistenable. Muddy 4track noise and peircing treble spikes hurt my ears. The live tracks at the end were the worst. But there was a few redeming qualaties, The song were she sings Bunny Bunny, I saw them on the pancake mountain website playing it live on a kids show! Let me stop complaining and by saying I LOVE THIS BAND!"
5,ouch,"when i first heard this album i was like ""coooool"". its really good. i hope you have a nice time listening to it."
3,Book Usefullness,"Presented a helpful perspective for someone who has never been depressed, but has a loved one who is. Definitely a psychologist's counseling view much more so than a psychiatrist's medicine-treatment view. Seemed somewhat out of date to me in the relative weight it gave to talk-therapy vs. medical treatment."
2,"A repetitious book, lacking any real depth or insight.",A disappointingly flat investigation into the complexities of depression. The tone is often condescending and assumes unneccessarily that the reader is not yet convinced that their loved one is indeed depressed. If you know that you are dealing with a depressed individual you'll need a more sophisticated book than this disappointing and glorified brochure.
3,Out of the morass,"This book, written by two psychologists at Columbia, confronts the difficulties faced by friends and relatives of people who suffer from clinical depression. Although perhaps a bit longer and more repetitive than necessary, it presents balanced and thorough information about depression and treatment options. The authors also acknowledge how easy it is to get caught in a morass with a depressed person and offer concrete (if difficult) suggestions about how to escape from that stuckness."
2,"Long on theory, short on practical advice","By the time I found this book, I had already read numerous other books and articles on depression. Most of the books out there are written TO the depressed person, but usually (certainly in my experience) the depressed person isn't interested in reading books! The book stresses getting clinical help, but in many cases that person strongly resists clinical help!I was looking for practical help for myself. How do I keep myself from slipping into depression, and making a bad situation worse? How can I pull my loved one out of their shell? How can I overcome that person's resistance to professional help? What is the best way to deal with a fit of anger or sadness caused by the disease? These questions are not answered by this book.If this is your first book on depression, it might help you understand the disease better. But if you already know the basics, and are looking for help in caring for a person you love who has depression, it just doesn't deliver much."
4,A good elementary textbook,"I have used this book as the primary textbook for an introductory course in the physics of music. It is at a somewhat higher level than some of its competitors (e.g. ""The Acoustical Foundations of Music"" by Backus) but still suitable for non-science majors with weak math backgrounds. It is the most thorough and informative book I have seen at this level. However, the students complained that it was somewhat dull. Also, the section on electronic reproduction of music is out of date--relatively little on CD's etc., and nothing on mp3 and related technologies. Still, I plan to use it again."
1,Terrible,"This book is terrible for beginners. It doesn't explain things well. The graphs and diagrams are hard to understand and it doesn't give enough examples to help you do the exercises at the end of the chapter. Also, there are a lot of typos and errors. For instance I tried to look up ""attenuation of sound"" in the index and the word was there with no page number. And I found a graph where the graph didn't match the descrpition. I have the advantage of having one of the authors of the book as my professor, and I still have a hard time understanding this book. It's horrible."
2,"Boring, big, bad","This book was required for a Musical Acoustics course. Worst textbook choice ever! Firstly, at 800 pages, it's too thick and heavy to take to class, even in a backpack. Second, the diagrams in the textbook are really old and in black and white and hard to tell what's going on. The book explains everything poorly. It covers so many topics that weren't even discussed in the class. The way it explains equations is terrible, especially when four different equations in the same chapter use the same letter to mean different things. Nothing is explained in an intuitive way. If you read everything carefully twice and double it up with Wikipedia, you might grasp the concepts.Bottom line, whatever bad things that could be said about a book, I want to say about this book. But if I want to be fair, it deserves more than one star. I mean, it does cover a large amount of material, and the summaries at the end of the chapters do provide a decent overview."
5,colest book I've read in a long time!!!!!!,This book keeps your hearts pounding and your eyes glued on the page. It put one of its very beloved charaters in great danger but it makes for an exciting book if your reading this I'm going to have to ask Why? you should be out reading 'Blooded'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Avoid this book,"The other Buffy books are pretty good, but this one is just laughable. The book is full of the worst aspects fo fanfic writing: constant references to every episode of Buffy, ""did you know"" statements, and so on. Angel is just pathetic in this book. All this plus the fact that this book could never actually take place in any season. It's probably better that way too."
3,Very good for Young Adult fiction,"When I got this book, I thought ""Boy, these 'Young Adult' books are getting thicker and thicker. Based on the size and content of this book, I thought that maybe they should have classified it as 'Adult Fiction.' Consequently, it came as no surprise when I saw that co-author Christopher Golden deemed this book as ""the 'bridge' between young adult and adult Buffy books."" The story of ""Blooded"" is very creative and ambitious with enough facets to please almost any ""Buffy"" fan. However, I did still seem to get a little bored in spots and at times it did still seem a bit ""Young Adultish."" As far as ""Young Adult"" books are concerned, ""Blooded"" was pretty good though."
4,Buffy's new enemy is close to her heart.,"This was very good. Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder did a great job writing this book! The reason I rated this book only four stars, is because it was kind of slow going, and a tad to bloody.Also Recomemeded: The rest of the Buffy series"
5,Best Yet,"This is the best yet in this series. It adds both angel and oz, who were ignored in the first four books."
5,Finally!,"Something to take the awful taste of ""Night of the Living Rerun"" out of my mouth! ""Blooded"" was wonderful! I read it on the train on a trip and just laughed til I cried. I let a friend of mine read it and even though he does not watch Buffy as avidly as the rest of us, even he was getting into the book. This one is wonderful and lots of fun. Obviously there was lots of research done and characterization and, (this is the best part!)it's obvious that THESE authors do actually watch the show, know the characters and have a clue! Thanks a whole bunch of garlic!! :)"
3,It was alright..,I have read several of the Buffy novels and I must say this one is the best. A lot of die-hard show fans are constantly complining of the lack of conection to the show. The idea going into the novel are intresting and unique but the writng is apallaing.
5,Great book with action and romance!,"""Blooded"" is an edge-of-your-seat read. It is based on an episode that hasn't aired, which makes it even more interesting for hard-core Buffy fans like myself. It is filled to the brim with fights, yet it is also extremely romantic. Even though the situations in the book are very serious, there are some hilarious lines that are great comic relief. If you love Buffy, you'll love this book!!!!!! I sure did!!!"
2,"A New Buffy Book, but not a great work of fiction...","This was not a great book, but if you're looking for Buffy material for a quick fix, this will certainly do. While the characters in the television show of the same name have grown and matured, the characters portrayed in this book have not. A disappointing addition to the series."
5,this book was great! it's a real must for buffy fans!,"the prolouge of this book was a tad confusing but was great. It had the romance of buffy and angel, the comedy of xander and willow,and was full of action and exitment."
3,Caution to the wind..,"This book was originally released built around an early release of the DirectX 9 SDK.If you grab the latest DirectX 9 SDK, some of the examples will not compile and run as-is. I attempted to contact the Author through his Blog web site asking for an updated release to the Source Code and never received a reply.Fortunately, the community has taken the initiative and released updates as needed--however, it took me a while to find the site. You can find updates and more (including links to the Blogs of DirectX team staff) at ""http://www.thezbuffer.com/"".I'm only about 60 pages into this book at the moment, and what I have learned has been very insightful and invaluable to my desire to learn more about DirectX."
2,Excelent Book for it's time,"When this book was written, Managed DirectX was in Beta. The author is the lead developer who was working on Managed DirectX. A year or two later, he wrote another book: ""Beginning 3D Game Programming"" published by SAMS. This other book is MUCH better. I can't even begin to explain how much better the second book is. All of the samples and explanations make much more sense. Look for it. It's out there."
4,Great introduction to the DX Managed API,"This book is great if you wish to get a good introduction to the Managed DirectX API itself. If you have no previous experience of 3D coding, this is not the book for you. To get anything out of this book you sholud have at least basic understanding of 3D math and 3D graphics. Also this book does not teach you how to design a 3D game engine. The examples in the book are basicly useless in a real engine. But they give you a great understanding of the API. And that's what the title is surgesting, isn't it?"
1,Very disappointed,The code doesn't compile with Visual Studio C# 2005 and doesn't work with the most recent DirectX 9. Please read other 1 star reviewers. They are correct. Don't waste your money.
1,"This book fails to teach DreictX or Game Programming!,","I was very disappointed in this book. It fails to cover DirectX at all! there's nothing about C# in it. There are several places that assume you have an understanding of C/C++. Novice programmers will be quite frustrated by this.this is one of several books that I originally bought this book as a gift for my young nephew who has not programmed in any language, hoping it was going to teach DirectX in the context of game programs. Unfortunately it fails to cover DirectX at all! and there are no chapters on games. Hardly worth putting Game Programming in the title.My recommendation is to find another book. Unfortunately this one does not live up to its promises."
1,"Managed DirectX 9, Kick Start","The trouble with this book is that it is long outdated. The code delivered with the book and discussed in the text no longer is part of DirectX9, so it is pretty much useless for learning the toolkit."
2,Didn't get much out of it,"I went into this book with a basic understanding of DirectX that I gained from free tutorials on the Internet. I'm also well versed in C# which is definitely a prerequisite. This book did not really added to my understanding of DirectX, and ""Game Programming"" really should be removed from the title. In fairness the book is a ""Kick start series"" and it is not suppose to be anything more than a primer. Also the author is clearly an expert of managed DirectX. Still it is a rather mediocre primer. The short code snippets followed by zero depth explanations are not much better than a help file. I have to agree with the previous post that the book is ""par for the course."""
2,I couldn't follow the examples,"When readng through this book, the later examples for the Dogder game do not work. There is errata in the book that prevents proper execution. Further, the author skips steps that aren't entirely clear when reading along. When looking at the sample code it is only end-product code, and doesn't help you through the steps in between. I found myself trying to get examples to compile and run more than learning the API."
1,"If this is swinging , then we want no part of it !","We have talked to many people, on the subject of swinging. Todate we have met dozens of ""couples""with GREAT attitudes towards swinging (together)the couple in this book seem not to have put any time into their relationship at all. Swingers in general seem to have found their ""soulmates"".Swinging in this book was used to simply have sex with other people, not to have an experiance with their spouse.If we had not talked to other couples before reading this book, we would have been mislead and discouraged from entering into the lifestyle.Due to the shortage of good swinging books this couple was able to publish a book. I recommend you try going to ""irc.dalnet.net"" and joining ""swingers"" and ask your questions there."
1,"""A POOR DEPICTION OF THE SWING LIFESTYLE""","We have been in the Swing Lifestyle now for more than seven years. The way Swing is described in this book is outrageous. We DON'T recommend it to anyone. Maybe in the 60's during the ""wife swapping"" days did these sexual only relationships occur. But in the 90's, Swing ""The Lifestyle"" is much more than dark room, no-name sex. We do vacations, kids ball games, birthday parties, pretty much everything most ""Straight Couples"" would do, but we also share our sexuality. This is not what Swing is all about. Swing in the 90's is having a relationship that is so strong and secure, you can explore sexuality outside the relationship without insecurity and jealousy. END"
5,"""Face To Face"" part deux?","Not quite. This is the album the way the band originally intended it to be, but the record company decided that a pseudo-hits package would sway more fans to the bandwagon. Don't know if the strategy was considered a success, but the end result was two great albums, albeit very different ones. Thank god for imports."
4,Read it!,"I absolutely loved Oedipus The King. It was exciting, even though I already knew the myth, and brought about catharsis. There is a wonderful use of imagery in it. Antigone, on the other hand, was not as moving to me. I had trouble identifying with Creon and did not pity Antigone. Still, I would recommend reading it. If anything you will at least have broadened your knowledge of Greek tragedy. Plus, the Oedipus plays will make up for Antigone's weaknesses. Also, keep in mind that most people like Antigone. What I've written is just my personal view."
1,Vanity Fair remake badly done and boring...,The copy of the film is a very bad version. It is a bad cut. And even with Myrna it is boring.
4,Stephen Hawking's Conjecture: the case against,"This book is a well put together documentation of the idea of time travel: from fiction to the actual physics equations. I have it beside my Weinberg Cosmology and my Wheeler Gravitation book. If he wrote this way about antigravity, someone might get it to actually work... We need more such books that make the future possible by giving us the facts we need!"
3,"Too much compilation, too little synthesis","Mr. Nahin obviously is very interested in the topic of time travel. He has read tons of sci-fi stories, has spoken with many physicists and/or read their books.But he is a journalist, not a physicist. And he makes little or even no effort to synthesise.As a result the book reads mostly like a list of everything that has been written by sci-fi writers, scientists and philosophers about the subject. But not like a book by someone who truly understands what is going on - provided it is possible to understand.In my view this is a good book because of all the material in it, all the references. But it is not a good book per se. I gave it 3 out of 5, including 1 point for all the references."
5,The BEST food shaver!,"Unbelievable! I was trying to shave a lot of garlic as part of making jars of roasted, marinated eggplant as food gift items for Christmas. I ordered this on 11Dec and had my fingers crossed for a quick delivery. I used normal delivery and it arrived on 16dec instead of 17dec-22dec as promised! I was soooo happy I got it early and shaving anything is now perfection! Great quality metal and I can adjust the thickness I want. can't ask for much more! I'm very happy I purchased this item. Plus everyone got their gifts on time! Thank you Amazon.com!!!Chocolate Truffle and Vegetable Shaver by TN Cassalinghi"
2,Too much for what it's actually worth,"This shaver didn't work for my truffles, it actually made them crumble as I tried to run them against the blade. I'd get a few good slices then it would all be a mess. I was trying to avoid buying a mandoline but think I'll just have to bite the bullet. Microplane with the single blade is probably the best way to go for truffles. To the seller's credit, a refund was issued with no problems."
5,Kitchen tools,"This little dude is a must have! Perfect for quick chipping action not only on truffles. I use it for garlic, fingerling potatoes, beets, everything. Manual dial adjustment provides perfect control! Beware, it will bite!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT A RECHARGABLE UNIT,"Be warned, Circut city is not shipping the rechargable units. They are shipping the units that take AA batteries. I spent much time on the phone with their India-based customer service only to find that they do not carry the recharable model."
4,Almost Perfect,"I Purchased This Remote For My Grandmother Because She Has Three Devices And The Remote Design Is Perfect For Her, The Buttons Are Big And Spacious Enough For Her To Feel What She Is Pushing Since She Can't See Too Well. The DVD/VCR Remote She Uses Has Too Many Buttons So That Was The Main Reason I Bought This Remote. Setup For The Remote Was Easy And Quick, I Programmed The TV First Then The Cable Box But When It Came Time To Program The DVD/VCR I Could Not Find A Code That Worked For A Magnavox MWD2205 DVD/VCR Player, That's Why I Say This Product Is Almost Perfect."
4,excellent,"This is not the Kraut art rock of Can, Neu, or Faust. Hairy Chapter is blistering hard rock with amazing guitar work.This album is filled with heavy riffs and searing guitar leads. The songs are well written, but if you like your rock frozen raw, Hairy Chapter has a distorted garage sound.Quite enjoyable."
3,It was alright,"i really thought this book had a lot of emotion, and although i couldnt quite relate to him in the ways he was having difficulties, i really liked how they displayed it. I could truly feel the charectar, yet it didnt seem like it could really be a true situation. I mean, what sort of writer would write a book about an albino boy and call it ghost boy, only to try in put in saddness to atract the public. It was pretty good, but not an interesting plot"
1,Avoid This Product,When it was working the player often made grinding noises when I would play a dvd. Then it stopped working altogether two weeks after the warranty expired. Also the sound levels were not nearly loud enough. Invest the extra money and get a better system.
2,Great Price but ...,"3 weeks after i received the item, it stopped working. everything worked fine until one morning we put it on to watch a movie and the drawer wont open and their was a terrible humming sound. the Radio was working but not the disc changer....we couldnt even get the other discs we had in it out! I live in the caribbean, and it is not worth the cost to send it back up to the manufacturer and have it re-shipped to me....it might be better to purchase a new home theatre system of a different brand !"
4,Has been very useful,The sound is certainly ok for our main living room - the only drawback is that the dvd drive is not region free and no hacks seem to be available for it.
4,Good Starter system,"Although this is a good beginner/starter system, it is not as loud as I had hoped. There was a post that said that it was good for smaller living rooms, well I don't know that mine could get any smaller and it is not as loud as I had hoped.The sound quality is decent though, and is really easy to setup. Everything is color coordinated."
5,Great Price and Quality,"This is a 5 disc DVD player that comes with surround sound speakers...for $99, what else could you ask for? The quality of the product is also pretty good even though it is under $100. I couldn't be happier!"
1,"Used Merchandise, No Thanks!","I don't recall seeing it in the listing anywhere that I was buying a used product but that's what I got. I don't know what these pieces are called, but the frame bolted section that isn't supposed to move, well it's busted & moves around. The round connection that pivots, has rubber in it so that it can bounce, the rubber was all cracked and obviously not new. Perhaps this was a reman, I dunno but I can say that it had a fresh coat of paint on it because the bolt holes looked like they've never been torqued down. Either way, i'm not going to spend an afternoon installing in the odd hopes that it will actually work properly, which i'm about 99.9% sure that it won't. Well.....there goes $50 bucks!I advise anyone needing this to ask if it's new, reman or used before you buy it."
3,"Just a 3 foot receiver, IT IS NOT an extension!","I bought this item to help me get more reach away from my vehicle to the trailer hitch. Since it said ""receiver extension"" I figured I could slip it into my current 2"" receiver to extend it. Not quite.....All this item consists of is the 2"" receiver part of a trailer hitch at three feet long. The female part that your hitch would go into is there with provision for the pin...but at the other end there is nothing. No provision for the male part to go into the 2"" receiver on your vehicle. The only way to get it to attach to your vehicle is with a welder.It is solid and well finished...just besure you know what you are getting.I will keep mine and modify it by welding a male part into the tube...but had I known when I ordered it that I would wind up welding up my own extension I wouldn't have bothered. That said, this part in my hand means about half the work to fabricate what I ultimately want is already done."
5,Nice...,"I like this video. It features an 12"" version of Lucky Star and Burning Up. There's only four features on this tape, but it's fun to watch. The photos on the box are also beautiful as well."
2,What this tape contains:,"While I haven't seen this video, a clarification was requested. The video contains 4 promo (mtv) videos: Burning up, Lucky Star, Borderline, and Like a Virgin. The three latter ones are also included on ""the immaculate collection"", which leaves only ""burning up"", one of her earliest songs, and not that great. This one seems to be for die hard fans only"
2,Not that great,"I thought the smaller line would add more flexibility to my marker, but it made more problems. The coils seemed to get snagged alot more than my thicker remote and after only 3 hours of normal play the line went bad. It broke just behind the quick disconnect. Not sure if it was a badline or just from stress."
3,OKAY micro for the price...entry level.,"Worked great, not problems but bothersome that the coiled tube was not very flexible and rather annoying after awhile. Lost the O-ring that goes around its quick-connect. Suggest getting a regular coil with flexible/durable hose and have some O-rings handy for the connection or you'll end up with a leak and pull it off altogether. It's OKAY, but I would have bought the full-size coil instead."
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"The first day I went out to the field, my friends noticed how thin this remote line was compared to theirs. I thought nothing of it until it broke the same day. This was the first time I used it and the line broke next to the quick disconnect for no apparent reason. Do not buy this cheap line. Spend the extra money on something that will last longer than a few games."
5,Walt Disney Bible,"This is truly a Bible if you are interested in Walt Disney's life. It doesn't hide any details from his life, and you can see from this official book that he wasn't a saint as a human being, and you can also see what a genious he was. It is amazing to see all the psychological virtues that this man had to keep his employees giving the best they can, and even more, without praising them.This book explains his detailed personal and professional life.I read many other biographies and I believe this is the most credible one. An honest story about this genius, who was also nothing but a human being, having all the flaws that come with being a human.A must have for everyone (not only Disney fans)!!!"
4,WALT DISNEY: AN AMERICAN ORIGINAL,"Excellent.Most of the same facts presented by other books, & movies with unique points of view provided by Disney Family, Studio, and Company's source material.Refreshing."
5,Inspiring!!!,"Walt Disney has always been someone I admired as a child and probably more so now as an adult. He inspired so many and this book describes about how it did not just come easy for Walt. Every thing he did was hard and he had to work even harder to work for what he believed in. Whether it was lying about his age to go into the Red Cross or talking up a movie before it was even made that it would be great. There are sides to Walt Disney that was not perfect or definitely not simple. No, Walt was not a simple man. From even a young age he showed imagination and potential. As did his brother Roy always by his side.I am more inspired as a person to work harder after reading this book. It seems that Walt saw potential in everything and everybody he saw or met. I am lucky enough to have seen some of his creations like movies and Walt Disney World. Even if some of it did not pan out as he envisioned. A very inspiring man and book."
5,"Disney, A Man and a Mouse",I am very pleased with the poster overall. It is a bit light and fuzzy but that only adds to the era of when the picture was taken. The poster is not signed as in the photo for the review but thats a good thing as it would take away from the art work. I give this item a rating of 5 as it was just what i was looking for in a price range I could afford and in color it beats all expections.
5,13 Things I Learned,"13 things I learned 1 - Pigs can't top pigs 2 - Travel and bring fresh ideas back to your business 3 - Watch out for crooks 4 - Trust people who love you 5 - Always be in control of your destinty 6 - Split and diversify 7 - People will act differently around the boss - get comfortable with it. 8 - Stay Positive 9 - Save Time 10 - do something new and valuable every minute 11 - Continue my dedication to education for all 12 - For the Lazy - the Boss' approach could inspire terror, others sure of their accomplishments find it reassuring. It means that their might be a chance their work will be reviewed and approved. 13 - World's Fair Lesson - Business Partnerships can save time and be properous."
5,Awesome addition to my growing Disney library!,Love Bob Thomas' writing style. Can't get enough about Walt Disney and how he grew up and then created the Walt Disney company. Thanks for a good read!
2,Meh,"This book was okay. It did not grab me the way many books do. I finished it and the story was all right, but the pacing of the book was not good. Exciting fights read slowley, conversations dragged on, and so on. If you like characters that are simple to understand and a simple story this is a good book for you. I would defiantly rate it as a 'beach book.' It's a book you can pick up and put down and have it out of your head as soon as it's down. Sorry for the mediocer review but it's not a wonderful book."
1,Nightfall,"Most of the reviews here say that Nightfall was a wonderful book. I disagree wholeheartedly. The plot was cliche and the action dragged horribly. Prince Edward's naivete was completely overdone and implausible. Nightfall is supposedly a legenday thief, but he comes off as alternately self-doubting and incredibly arrogant. All in all, this book was a waste of time."
5,"Still Re-read this book, after 15+ years.","I picked The Legend of Nightfall up when I was 12, on a random whim, I remember thinking the cover looked interesting (and it was pink, another plus for a 12 year old girl). When I lost my apartment to a fire, this book was one of the few things I grabbed on my escape. Nightfall has always been my go to book for needing to get lost in a rich, vibrant fantasy world that keeps me on the edge of my seat. Nightfall grabs your attention and keeps you spell bound for every page. From the first line of the book I was hooked, and have been since. I would recommend this book to anyone to read, only because how addicting the story truly is, even after 15 years."
2,Legend.... or Lie?,"I have to admit, I liked the character of Nightfall, or rather, Sudian. I admire that he's created a reputation for himself based on lies and vicious rumors so that he is regaurded with fear by all who hear his name, even if that actually makes him a fraud. And I liked his name, so much that I named my black cat Sudian, even though she's turned out to be a female.But that's about it. What little dialogue there was was flat and weak. Most of the story seemed to revolve around Nightfall's internal musings. Nothing really ever seemed to happen that was interesting, and after plodding along through half the book, I set it on my shelf and went to bed. The story was so uninteresting that I wasn't compelled to pick it up again, and so have never finished it. I don't think I will. I'd reccomend the Nightrunner series for those of you looking for a more interesting fantasy read."
2,Too much of not enough,"Avant garde neo-classical chamber music does posses a few attributes which can sometimes take these intellectual scribblings past atonal indulgence, but altogether the work plays out like just another minor-key mishap."
1,Screaming Strings; Jarring Chords,"Sylvie Courvoisier's Abaton can only be understood and appreciated by trained musical geniuses or pretentious bores. What most fans of European chamber jazz would recognize as melody is non-existent on this double (and double-priced)CD.Courvoisier's piano is background on all of the 22 tracks in this collection almost serving as a base line for the violin and cello. However, that would imply that these tracks follow some sort of structure and they don't. The piano here just bangs out an occasional thumping cord as a counter-point to the wailing strings.Even ECM can't bat 1000 but Abaton is a joyless dirge of noise that is occasionally punctuated by a silence that may make you hope it's over and you can get on with your life."
2,Very disappointed...,"I bought this CD player over a year ago. I loved the look, yet the motor always seems so noisy. Last month, the CD player stopped working. It would have been wiser to have spent more money on something that would have lasted longer."
1,"Okay at first, turns sour later","This unit looked cool in the store and the display sound was promising. Two months later, there was a whirring sound in the fan in the back of the machine. Despite efforts to clean it out (thinking it was dust) it still whirs and is loud and distracting. Don't be fooled by the good looks."
1,Waste of money!,"I wish I read the reviews before I bought it. I thought it was wonderful, until my system had the same problem that was mentioned by another person. I also had the &amp;amp;quot;no disc&amp;amp;quot; appear. It's amazing that the problems started to happen almost a year after I bought it (yes, note the sarcasam). My advice - something more expensive is worth the investment. Don't waste your money on this, you'll just have to buy a new one a year later!"
5,dumb thingy,this thing sucks... it is a masterpiece of the art and science which I find very biblical: the masterpiece expresses a greal deal of nourishing banquetism and I didn't really find any comfort when reviewing this item... it should be banned.
2,Poor sound and loud cooling fan,The sound quality was very dissapointing and not adequate for loud bass thumping music. There is a small cooling fan in the back which one can hear over the music. This is quite annoying if I wish to play my music low while i fall asleep. The bright light on the front is even too bright in my room at night when turned off. It lights up my whole bedroom when turned on at night which can be very distracting. I am constantly putting a dark towel over it at night just to fall asleep. Do not buy this.
1,Thank God for a warrenty,"I asked for and recieved this as a Christmas present. At first, everything was great, I loved the sleek look, and it had a nice sound. The features appear to be great, but they don't deliver. After a bit over a month, the CD player started acting strange and wouldn't play CD-Rs any longer. A few weeks after that, all CDs would play the first few tracks, then the CD would just spin as the display blinked. I don't know if this was a problem in my systwm alone, but I won't chance another. I'm moving on to a different brand and model hoping for sucess. However, the product does have a 90 day warrenty, which allowed me to return it with no-hassle, so maybe someone else will have better sucess."
3,Ok but not Great,"The sound is great for the price of it, it has all the fuctions a normal stereo would have, althougth the lite is too brigth the price is great, if your looking for a cheap,ok stereo this would be perfect for you. Omar,Fl"
2,Its not as good as it looks!,"This stereo looks amazing, compact, and sleek. But I got this stereo for my birthday in October, and right away, the volume didn't work at all. I exchanged the stereo for the same kind, but after a month now, the screen is broken and is ""scrambled"" all the time, and sometimes I'm not even able to turn it on due to this problem. The design is great, but the product itself is not that great."
3,NOT TOO BAD,"THIS DVD IS OK, THOUGH THEY ARE ALL MUCH TO SAME, THEY SEEM TO TALK TO THE SAME PEOPLE IN ALL THESE SORT OF DVDS. BUT IT'S NOT TOO BAD."
2,ITS OK,"I THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY LIFELIKE AND I LIKE THE WAY THAT SHE USES SLIGHTLY BIGGER WOMEN IN HER PAINTINGS BEACAUSE TODAYS MEDIA LOOKS LIKE WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF PERFECT, SKINNY, SIZE 2 MODELS AND THAT DOESNT REFLECT THE GENERAL WEIGHT/MASS OF PEOPLEHANNAH MORTELL AGE 13"
3,just par,"A little bit of a disappointment to be honest. Every painting in this book has been published already except for 'torso 1'. I think I was looking for the ""complete works"" not just some selected ones that the publisher thought was representing. On top of that, the writings by the late David Sylvester and Linda Nochlin where also previously published. On a good note, the people out there who don't already have the Territories, Migrants or Macro catalogues need not spend thousands of dollars trying to acquire them now. I did like the studio photos and the close-ups. It does give you a sense of how she works and what makes up her paintings. Nothing substitutes seeing Jenny Saville's work in person but being able to see her brush strokes does help a lot. I guess it's worth the thirty dollars or so for the book. Just don't look for a Catalogue Raisonne."
3,Disappointing,"I'm a simple painter with a large collection of art monographs. I was excited to learn of this release that I pre-ordered from Amazon back in September. This would be the first comprehensive tome on the young Miss Saville. I have bit and pieces here and there, but as you know, it's quite nice to have it collected in one serious, single book. It would have been great had that happened. Instead, I found a confusing collage of frank source material and paintings that does neither justice. Her monumental human landscapes and faces lose scale and the murky and lurid studio images almost take center stage. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think a more focused book on her paintings would feel more satisfying, although less trendy."
4,I'm repulsed and yet I cannot look away...,"I have mixed feeling about this book. Jenny Saville is an amazing painter, but the subject matter is so grotesque I can never get through the book in one sitting without closing it in disgust. Dead meat, obese naked women, surgery & bloody flesh, hermaphrodites....I can't tell if she's disturbed or chooses these subjects for shock value to get attention in the art world. Whatever the case may be, her talent cannot be denied. The reason it is so disturbing is also the reason it is so great - because her rendering is so true to flesh. From the perspective of an art lover and a would-be painter, I am amazed by her talent and style. She definitely stands out, and this book deserves it's place in my art library."
5,Very Nice Book,"This book is top-notch. The reproductions are very well done, and there are tons of close-up shots of individual paintings showing Saville's brush work. I would highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in contemporary art, portraiture, or figure painting. As a painting student, it is great to be able to see the whole painting on one page and then examine a series of close-ups and even shots of the artist's reference materials. Very informative. Oh, and the paintings are stunningly beautiful as well!!!"
3,Got Rusty,"This mold was a good size and shape, and my pudding steamed up nicely in it. When I stored my pudding in it in the fridge however, it got all rusty. I don't think it is safe to cook in it a second time. I'm going to try to find a mold that doesn't corrode, maybe silicone or stainless steel, next time."
4,"Patient, minimal house","All around quality electronic thump-brooding that continuously builds, song peaks achieved through subtle sonic progression rather than redundantly timed bombast. Ends on a rather strange note, 4/4 kick non-existent, instead Melian's own Nico-esque vocals against bittersweet chello and choir arrangements. This could be seen as a very disjointed ending, but for some reason seems rather appropriate to the album. More suited for background music than attentive listening sessions, which is fine by me."
5,AWESOME - The best Electronic-House Album Ever!,"I have owned it for over 5 years and it is my favorite Electronic / House album of all times. SMU2 is an unbelievable collection of upbeat tunes so catchy that you'll find yourself singing them. ""Another World"" and ""Blow Your Mind"" are incredible and I never get tired to listen to them (even after few hundred times...). The album overall is fantastic and there are no fillers, in fact every track could easily be a single release. This is a must have for everybody who loves Electronic and House music."
5,Definitive text,"This was practically designed to be a companion to Michel Foucault's A History of Madness. Stiker focuses on physical disabilities but traces some of the same important fractures in the historical geanology of the conceptualization disability. Perhaps the most important contibution in here is his extension of this genealogy through what he calls ""The Age of Rehabilitation."" If you are studying the sociology or history of disability, this is a must have."
4,religious,For anyone reading or studying the bible this should be a must have. Unless you have the capability of memorizing the bible you can look up where to find most verses with very few words.
1,Poor Concordance,"This supposedly ""concise"" concordance was a big disappointment. For some reason it does not have complete listings of words. I was hoping to find a good concordance keyed to my New American Bible, but I will have to go back to using a concordance keyed to the King James Bible."
1,Just to small,I ordered this to learn how to make these tasty treats. When it came I was dissappointed with how small it was. It won't even fit on the burner right because of its size. It would however be great for camping over a fire or something. It just doesn't work well on a gas burner. I will have to get a larger one that will fit on the stove.
2,Too small,I ordered this instead of the one on Williams Sonoma because it looked similar but cost much less. I guess you really do get what you pay for. It is very small and it took a long time to make enough for 5 people.
1,aebeleskiver pan,nice cast iron but much smaller than the one my gramma used- TOO little- go for the 9 in. 9 cup size.
1,AWFUL METAL TASTE-WOULDN'T GO AWAY,This was GROSS I had to send it back! No matter how many times I washed it the METAL TASTE was still there! Don't waste your money buy a better quality pan!
2,Food stuck badly,"Even after seasoning this pan per instructions twice, my recipe stuck in the pan and I threw the pan away. I don't have time for something like this. I will buy an aluminum non stick pan instead."
2,Great pan but takes too long,This is a great aebleskiver pan but it's just not practical. It takes way to long to make enough to feed a family.
5,Pancake balls,"I grew up eating and making aebelskiver. They even were similar to the ones I ordered in Copenhagen. When my niece wanted to know where to find a pan, I went straight to Amazon. She opened her present on Sunday before Christmas. Taking the advice I had read online, she seasoned the pan three times and brought it down to use Christmas morning. It worked beautifully. We made aebelskiver with chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, cheddar and bacon and pineapple and marshmallows. What a feast."
5,one of Ohara's 70s classics,"A very comprehensive little book on Hung Gar boxing by a fine artist.Includes:breathing,stretching,stances,form&application,footwork diagrams for each movement,as well as informative reading.Back in the 70s Ohara was pretty much THE source for martial arts guidebooks and they set a standard that is still very competitive with the newly pulished works of today.This book along with:Wing Chun-James Yimm lee,Sil Lum kung fu-Leo T. Fong,Choy Lay Fut-Leo Fong,White Crane gung fu-Michael Staples,and Muay Thai Kickboxing-Hardy Stockman,are all fine examples of Ohara's great martial arts books of the 70s."
4,Hi-Yah!,I follow this style of Kung-Fu It helps to have something to refer to and I like to understand the reasoning behind the move... the physics of it all.Anyway - It works well for me.
2,It was delicious!,I can not tell you how effective the product is or is not. I placed it on my dog Ginger to get her adapted to it. I did not keep a close eye on her and she chewed the harness right off. Ginger apparently did not like it.
1,hated it,"I've read several Johanna Lindsey books. I've only been able to finish a couple of them. Usually, I get tired of her books and stop. I finished this book (by skimming it) probably because I hated the ""hero"" so much and wanted to see what would happen when he found out the heroine- who he had been raping and abusing throughout the entire book because she was a servant and he felt that he could- was actually a Lady. Not surprisingly, I was disappointed. This was one of the few books where I did not want the heroine to end up with the ""hero"". So if you want to read a book where the hero has no respect for the heroine and treats her like dirt then read this one."
4,Enjoyable,"I thought this book enjoyable, not the best I've ever read but definitely good. The story was a little lacking in the relationship development(the characters begin to care for each other in one chapter, when previously they disliked each other intensely)but overall, Brigitte and Rowland were strong characters. For those readers that think beating women in books is a disgrace: I completely agree with you, but the story takes place in the 900's, women weren't exactly treated well back then. I would even go so far to say that Brigitte was probably beaten a whole lot less than the women who actually lived in this time period. The story flows, and there is a plot, and a rather clever one too. All in all, a book worth reading."
1,not worth the time.........,"This is possibly the worst romance novel I have ever read. The only reason I continued reading it to the end was because I was perplexed at how the heroine(Brigitte) could ever possibly fall in love with the hero, Rowland. I could not understand how one second, the heroine would try to run away and proclaim she hated and then do a complete 180 three seconds later.This novel is seriously not worth the time if you're looking for quality character development. As I said, the only reason to read it until the end was because I wanted to know what other unbelievable bull was going to happen on the next page."
3,Not a bad historical,"I just realized my issue with historicals is that women had no rights. Therefore, it is always hard for me to believe they can 'fall in love' with such callous men. That being said, this is a pretty good historical. But I won't keep it. It is not a book I would pick up and reread because it was so great. Again, the problem is not in the writing, but my own tastes."
4,Very good for a romantic medieval read!,This is not my favorite time period but I do love Johanna Lindsey books and this was no exception. The characters were well developed and you truly felt the intense connection between the two characters. The misunderstandings between them were conceivable and not contrived and totally understandable. I loved Rowland as the hero - he had been raised under such tough conditions but it had not taken the very core of his good sole away from him. Several of the surprises at the end were touching effects to a beautiful love story!
3,Could've been better...,"This was a good romance, but like most of JL's earlier novels, the hero (Rowland) is just too mean at times. I hate it when the hero beats the girl he loves. Otherwise, it was good. Brigitte was very likable, and the time period and French setting were unique."
2,Wasn't my favorite,I'm a huge fan of Ms. Lindsey's books but this one did not do it for me. The only exciting part was almost toward the end. The heroine drove me CRAZY and the hero wasn't to much better. Overall it was not one of her best in my opinion.
4,Like it.,I like it. A good book... well worth the read. I usually don't re-read books but I've read it twice now.
1,"Good idea, Bad development","The overall idea for this book was a good one. But the way the characters are developed leaves much to be desired. Brigitte comes across as a shallow naive little girl who is such a wimp it's hard to read her ""supossed"" attemps at bravery. As for Rowland, he is coarse and rude and is forever so cruel to her. The book itself is slow paced and when finaly things start to happen the book is over. I do not recomend this book."
1,Nasty Tasting,"I purchased the 36 count Jolly Rancher Cherry Flavored Stix. I picked this item because I only like the cherry flavored jolly ranchers. When I tried the first stick, it tasted differnt. I thought it was maybe just that certain stix. Not So. Everyone tastes different. They taste nasty to be honest. Now I have 30 Cherry Jolly Rancher stix's in my draw taking up space. Just gotta wait till Halloween 2007 to get ride of the damn things. Basically, DON'T PURCHASE THIS ITEM. THEY ARE GROSS. Also, the shipping cost more then the darn product so it is a waste. I made that mistake and hopefully you won't do that same."
3,A thread in a new mystery series.,"Jonathan Steele warned his half-brother David that he must replace embezzled funds or face arrest. David laughs him off, stating that while he and his wife are out of the country, Jonathan will suffer a fatal accident. In short order, a mysterious killer murders David and his wife while Cynthia Morgan drinks poisoned coffee meant for Jonathan. When Cynthia learns Jonathan is now left with custody of his nephew, she offers her company's temporary nanny services. Jonathan agrees, if Cynthia will be the nanny once she is out of the hospital. Jonathan is attracted to Cynthia, but he doesn't believe in love and happily ever after.A nice tale with an unsolved mystery which will be addressed in another author's book. Jonathan's background clearly explains his reluctance to believe in love. The lack of FBI agents swarming around Jonathan after the murder was unrealistic."
1,Beware,"Beware, these are ""Brentwood"" DVD's that normally sell for four dollars or so on the junk racks. Ten films for twenty dollar is something of a bargain if you don't mind films that seem re-mastered straight from VHS. The black & white films are muddy. The color films are just adequate. Sadly, Hope fans must wait longer for viewable versions of ""My Favorite Brunette"", ""The Great Lover"", and ""The Lemmon Drop Kid'. Some of the other titles are available elsewhere in better versions."
1,Do Not Buy,"Beware of this collection. At least two of the films - Seven Little Foys and Lemon Drop Kid - are severely truncated, with musical numbers cut out, presumably to avoid paying for rights. That means you watch all of Lemon Drop Kid without hearing Hope and Maxwell sing the film's hit song, ""Silver Bells."" Shameful. So bypass the bargain pricing and spend your money on Hope collections elsewhere."
2,I Hoped For Better (get it?),"I hate to be the fly in the ointment, but although these are some wonderful films, the transfers left much to be desired in most cases. Worst among the lot is ""My Favorite Brunette"". You can download a cleaner copy of that particular film at the Internet Archive to tell you the truth! There were others that left much to be desired as well, but suffice it to say that none of these were taken from the best source material available. The films themselves are great, and even knowing what I know about the set now, I suppose I'd still order it considering the price. BTW, the packaging isn't great, but it's about what you'd expect on a bargain set like this."
2,no captions or subtitles,"we have a deaf family member who excitedly ordered this set after reading the Amazon specifications which stated that the movies contained on this set were closed captioned. They are not. We were very disappointed and had to return the package to Amazon for refund. Attention all deaf and hearing impaired Bob Hope lovers! No closed captions or subtitles on this set makes for a DVD box that deserves only two stars (one star for the lack of captions, four stars for the movies)."
3,Bob Hope Movie Collection,I enjoyed the movies but the case it came in was really terrible so many disc's in a very badly designed holder. I am afraid they will become scratched!
5,4 wheeler tires,"Very happy with this purchase. Tires arrived very fast and are exactly as discribed. Installed them as soon as they got here, they are just what I needed."
5,Black pearls,The earrings are very beautiful; my wife loves them and our oldest granddaughter (10 y.0.) already asked for them when grandma gets tired of the pearls.
4,sweet deal,"i really like the first song which isn't a remix, also i like some of the remixes too. you can't even tell that she (alsou) has an acsent. she's russian and she sings pretty damn well in english. so if yur bored and you wanna lay down and relax and u wanna dance. buy this album! you'll love it"
4,"A good book, BUT","This is a handy book, a lot of pieces shown, but I found one problem with the book. There is not enough info given on who actually made the pieces. I have found items, but not manufacturer, which is not a help when trying to accurately identify something. Some pieces have more info than others. It is a nice book though, the pictures are clear, in color and very easy to see. I just wish more info had been provided on who made some of the pieces."
4,A Great Updated Kitchen Glassware Reference Guide,"New 272 page, hardcover volume with laminated covers. It features over 5,000 items, clearly pictured in color for ready reference. The period covers from the depression through the 1960's. Featured companies include: Anchor-Hocking, Fry, Hazel-Atlas, Jeannette, Pyrex,and more. There are inumerable patterns and colors. Items range from batter jugs and bowels, coffee and tea pots, ice buckets and knives, to salad sets, salt boxes, shakers, straw holders and water bottles. There is a ""buyer beware"" section covering reproductions. A very useful and informative reference."
4,it's a keeper,An excellent resource superior to their book on Oven Ware. I would highly recommend. Lots of pictures and values.
3,Lacks Organization,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews. While the photos are crisp and clear, the book is not organized well and not enough manufacturer information is given. It is difficult to quickly find an item when you are trying to reference something. All in all, it is somewhat useful, but it is NOT my ""go to"" guide."
2,Not Good,"Too much static even when I change all the channels.Goes dead quickly (I brought it in September and it went out in December)Which is shocking because its always charging and the ringer is off.I change the battery in December and again it goes dead in May. Finally I return it back to the store and got it replace with another brand.Good thing about this phone. Its appearance, thats the only good thing."
2,Inferior to Panasonic or Uniden,"Bought this phone, plugged it in, listened to one message that I had recorded, and that was all it took to return it to the store. The clarity of the voice was very poor compared to equal priced Panasonic or Uniden. The set-up was less user-friendly than the others as well. The phone portion was good, but not better than it's competition. The quality of construction was very good. I do not recommend this phone, even at it's low price."
1,Negative Five Stars!,"(...)The battery life SUCKS (hello, this is 2004), it wont ever charge properly, when the battery life is dying (conveniently while I'm on the phone) it makes this high pitched ""You're phone sucks and you'll lose your call!"" sound, right in the ear.This is the worst phone I've ever owned, and sadly for technology, the most recent."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"The batteries didn't even last 6 months, plus I found it hard to find a place that sold the batteries since it only takes one type of V-tech battery. The sound quality sucked!!!! The only decent part is the answering machine. Skip getting this one!"
1,Horrible!,"I've had this phone for only about 5 months. What a horrible POS! The sound quality is unbearable, and has been since day one. Whenever I get a call, I pick it up, then immediately head downstairs to pick up my 6 year old vtech which sounds much better. And just recently, the battery refuses to hold any charge, after only 6 months use. Unexcusable."
1,"Good Looking Phone, Bad Battery","I bought this phone about a year ago and in a few months started having problems with the battery. It simply would not hold charge for more than a hour. Recently it got worse, so I got a brand new 1000 mAH battery and surprisingly still have the same problem. There is some inherent problem with the charging operation of this phone. My advise is - avoid VTECH phones if possible."
1,Poor Performer,Not a bad phone if you live in a studio apartment and prefer to talk for less than 15 minutes at a time. I would lose reception when I would move about my small home and the battery would die when talking for any extended amount of time. I recommend a phone with a cord. At least you'll get the same amount of range without the frustration of the limited battery life.
1,Horrible just horrible,This is easilly the worst cordless phone I've ever seen. The sound quality is terrible. It make deafening squealing sounds and the battery lasts about 5 minutes. Steer clear of anything by Vtech.
4,valuable and thoughtful addition to reflections on TLotR,"Thoughtful, very well written, intelligent and highly readable exposition of the spiritual substructure of TLotR, focusing on its not named, mostly hidden, yet still primary character: God.A notable, valuable addition to the growing body of literature on TLotR, one of the better books approaching the subject from a Protestant context. Definitely much worth it. Excellent source of potential Tolkien sermon illustrations."
1,Are you kidding?,"It is more than well known that Tolkien, even he said as much, took great inspiration for his stories from Beowulf, the Kalevala, the Poetic Edda, the Volsunga saga and the Hervarar saga, as well as ancient Anglo Saxon sources. There is practically nothing 'Christian influenced' about his stories, rather the inspiration comes from the Pagan past of northern European religions. Even Tolkien himself is known to have said this much. Geez, look it up!I'll never understand why some people cannot comprehend that sometimes a great writer is just a great writer regardless of his personal faith. The man had an extensive knowledge of northern European pagan literature. It is so sad to see that some cannot help but twist another person's writing to attempt to prop up their own version of their own little world, and legitimate scholarship and academia be darned."
2,He sadly doesn't get it,"Like nearly every other Protestant commentator (with notable exceptions such as David Wells) Rutledge just doesn't get it. It makes one wonder.Is it that most evangelicals (and I'm an evangelical) don't know enough about Catholicism or English literature to understand what Tolkien is doing?Is there something flawed and inadequate with the -American- evangelical worldview that shows up when they try to understand something Catholic?Rutledge is not alone in this failing, I don't think it is a unique personal flaw. There are other Protestant books out on Tolkien due to the movies, and they share the same shallow, technique-y understanding of life, the universe and everything that makes them so clueless in understanding the depth and layers to the Tolkienan corpus. When there is a pattern, you start wondering what it means.David Wells is an exception. Perhaps because he is an English prof. Perhaps because he loved the books before they became popular."
4,Cant lose with Nelson and Jeanette,"It was suppose to be in color, but with ongoing problems ...like always..MGM shot it in black and white. Im so used to see Nelson and Jeanette inblack in white that i does not bother me anymore... The Love stories arealways a pleasure to watch and the signing usually melts me down.There was some ongoing friction between the two stars when the movie wasfilmed but it does'nt show. Lots of people can sing, but none can beatthe duo of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Macdonald.....Music Gold."
5,Exceeded my expectations,The warmth and truism of the volume was inspirational and real...I appreciate the work and dedication exhibited by Ms. Coates to be an instrument for Higher Dimensional impartations.
3,St. George and the Dragon and the Quest for the Holy Grail,"Book is in good shape, some moister stains along page edge, some highlighting. Cover excellent shape. Well worth the $4."
1,License REQUIRED,"There is a license required for GMRS radios. It is $75. Funny how the merchants don't tell you that. Perhaps because of the &quot;extra&quot; cost? By the way... the fine for unlicensed operation of these radios is up to $10,000."
5,WoW!!! What a GREAT Radio,I cant believe how far these radios work. I have one at my house and another at my friends house (almost 4 1/2 miles away) and we get great clearity in ur conversations. I recommend this product to anyone.
1,TESTED THE 3 WATT COBRA RADIO,"PURCHASED A SET TODAY AND PUT THEM THRU THE TEST. MATCHED THEM AGAINST THE SP21 MOTOROLA PRO. TESTED ON GMRS FREQS. FIRST THE 3 WATTS DID NOT MEAN ALOT AS THE DISTANCE WAS ABOUT ALMOST 2 MILES IN THE SUBURBAN AREAS TESTED. I GOT MORE DISTANCE OUT OF THE SP21 AND THATS ONLY 2 WATTS. NEXT THE SOUND QUALITY WAS POOR. THE TRANSMIT VOLUME WAS LOW AND NOT VERY LOUD AS A SP21. THE DISPLAY WINDOW WAS HARD TO READ=TOO SMALL OF LETTERING. VERY POOR BACKLIGHT,COULD NOT REALLY TELL IF IT HAD A LIGHT AT ALL. POORLY CONSTRUCTED,FELT CHEAP IN THE HAND. BUTTONS HARD TO PUSH. I AM TAKEING THEM BACK TO WALLMART FOR A REFUND. NOT WORTH ANY MONEY IN MY OPINION. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL=BIG ZERO. ONE FINAL NOTE. IT HAS A GREAT DIGITAL ELECTRONIC COMPASS SO IF YOU NEED A COMPASS BUT IT BUT IF YOU INTEND ON USEING IT AS A 2 WAY RADIO FORGET IT."
1,Why is it called Sulfur Shampoo?,Is it me or is there actually no Sulfur in this shampoo? It has Triclosan which according to the FDA is under review and has no health benefits aside from treating bacteria in the mouth...hm...?
1,Not the same product,"Sulfur8 had sulfur in it at one time and it was a wonderful shampoo, why they messed with a good thing is beyond me. I will not buy this again."
5,works good and good smell,This works good and has a nice fragrance that's not overpowering. They don't specify on the advertisement but this product contains triclosan for antibacterial use for skin conditions that respond to antibacterial products. I like this better than the other antibacterial products available for this use.
4,Hard to draw conclusions.,"Evolutionary Origins of Morality is packed with interesting science, but the format makes it difficult know what to make of it all. If the experts studying this stuff don't agree, then how am I supposed to make up my mind? Since I live with several animals, it's easy for me to pick a side of the argument even though half the chapters say I'm probably wrong. The format of presenting a paper followed by a critique of that paper is enightening and befuddling at the same time. It will certainly make you think."
5,Old friends,We enjoyed each and every episode and loved remembering the old series. Steed and Mrs. Peel are still interesting after all these years.
2,Same Old Song,"Charles Whiting has a very low opinion of the High Command of the U.S. Army. In all of his books that I've read, he tells variations of the same story: the incompetence of senior American officers leading to the sacrifice of G.I.s. The Battle of Kasserine Pass in early 1943 should give Whiting the perfect opportunity for developing his theme: this first major encounter between U.S. forces and Rommel's Afrika Korps was badly botched by the Americans. But I finished the book not much wiser than I started about what exactly went wrong. Whiting seemed to be attributing the defeat to the alcoholism of the general commanding the American II Corps. A far more nuanced and balanced analysis of the battle is provided by Martin Blumenson in his book. The Blumenson volume is out of print, but, if you want to understand the complexities of the defeat at Kasserine, find it."
4,The Invisible Man,"This is a very good book for many reasons. I really like older books because most the people who wrote them are not even around. The Invisible Man has a very compelling background story. It is amazing how they came up with a formula to change men to be invisible. If you like scary books, this one will blow you away. This describes better than a movie ever could. I would like to see you finish this book."
1,What a terrible edition,"Both the endnotes and the footnotes in The Time Machine contain spoilers for plot and character. The laughably uneven footnoting of terms that appear in any dictionary as well as only slightly archaic usage is bad enough, but to explain away hints and glimpses we're given by drawing attention to them and revealing their meaning prematurely is unacceptable."
5,Science fiction back to back.,"Here you get a double dose of H.G. well's rare writing talent. The man who first thought up the time travel story and the invisible man one. I'm sure that all of you out there have seen a lot of time travel and invisible man movies but none of them compares with the wit and style that the father of that genre, h. g. wells, did. You must own this book! This double book is the best thing to read on those long trips. Although, I give you pre-warning, that the time machine is written straight from the an observer but the whole story is conveyed through him telling his tale. Likewise, The invisible man, in his story, has a dialogue that lasts for four or five chapters. But, other than all that, these stories are turly creative gems that you must dig up."
2,"functional, poor quality","Bought these from the web thought it looked great on the picture. When I got it I was disappointed. The handle is very thin and uncomfortable to hold. I guess the price speaks for itself. Though it serves the purpose, I don't see myself using it often. I guess I am in the market for another set of better quality ones."
3,"Obscure all-female disco group is nothing special together, but launched moderately successful solo careers for 2 of its members","A short-lived group featuring Marva Hicks and Sylvia Striplin among its members, Eighties Ladies have all but been forgotten by now, and while the album isn't terrible, it doesn't exactly have abundant staying power either despite being produced by Roy Ayers. Striplin and Hicks both had moderately successful solo careers, but the perhaps the most memorable turn ever taken by a member of this group was by Susan Beaubian, who, 8 years after this album was made, played O.J. Simpson's distraught wife in the hilarious comedy film The Naked Gun."
1,OMG put out a new CD!,"Alright the first cd was amazing, and the song on this cd is also pretty good, but we real trapt fans don't want a f****** t-shirt, we want an entire new cd of music. this is a complete waste of time for one trapt song, buy it on itunes or wutevr u have, but don't buy this cd/t-shirt combo, its a waste of money."
1,didn't work,"I spend several hours with tech support trying to connect a Win XP desktop to a Win 98 laptop and it never worked. I formerly used version 1.52 and it did work, but was squirrelly (and not compatible with XP). Obviously no progress was made with 3.0.Plus, you can only access tech support via chat, so every time you reboot you lose them. Annoying.Bottom line -- PCSync is at best way too complicated for a consumer product."
1,Wow! That bad!?!,"Very frustrating experience. After spending money bucks for this piece of junk and wasting hours-and-hours, I threw it back in the box, never to use it again. I have a pretty simple situation... ""old"" PII/233 running W95, new PC running XP. Simply wanted to transfer a bunch of MP3s, photo files, and a few other miscellaneous data files. It took three hours just to get it configured and working. Once it finally did connect (which it only did sporadically), it was SO SLOW in transfering the files, I simply gave up. Of course, you need to be a master dective to find a phone number to call for support.... After using the extremely weak manual, I went on line to find help, but found nothing more than the manual information. The error messages are cryptic and the online help is dismal. And, I could not find a phone number to call. So, do what I did... simply burn a bunch of CDs and call it a day... it will save you $ and hours of frustration!!!"
1,Save your $,"Wasted 8 hours trying to make PCsync 3.0 work. Failed repeatedly to make serial connection. Tried everything in support files, nothing worked. This program setup is not easy and not for the average user. Ended up transferring all files to new computer using CD/RW. Should have done that first, would have saved a day."
3,waiting for parts....,I too put this game together easily. Many pieces but instructions were great! The problem was with the scoreboard electronics. I called the company and they will send me a new piece in mid-January. We are having fun without the scoreboard but I am having trouble convincing my 6 and 11 year old grandsons to be patient.
3,Fun but needs adjustments.,"We bought this for Christmas. It is ALOT of fun! However, we had to take our nets off the rims because the nets were tangling up with the scoring paddles. And the ball return, while sturdy, is too high and too close to the rims. We unhooked the ball return behind the backboard to lower it. Now the balls have more room to drop (they kept getting stuck in the rims.) It was easy to assemble (my husband and I did it in about an hour and a half.) My uncle bought another brand pop-a-shot, and his nets only go 3/4 of the way around the rim, so the scoring paddle does not get tangled. I might cut my nets an opening for the paddles. We don't like playing without the nets. I was a little unhappy that we had to make the adjustments. It seems like that should have been figured out in the design process. That said, my family loves playing the game!"
2,Poor Quality Double-shot Basketball,"I want a refund for this unit. The electronic score did not work. The materials are so thin and flimsy, poor quality, pressed board backboard is like cardboard. The best thing about it was the little basket balls by Spalding?? It seems like a piece of crap from China. Oh it was made in China - go figure, Shame on you Spalding for selling out. Very embarrassing for the family get together I bought it for. I want my money back."
2,At least the kids love it,I read other reviews warning that this was a bear to put together. So I had it shipped directly to my brothers home for a Christmas gift for our nieces and nephews. Having my brother deal with putting it together was my best move of 2008. There was a wrong piece shipped that added to the diffcult assembly. Drove my brother mad but at least I came out looking good with the kids.
1,Spalding 4020 B-ball,"I purchased the Spalding 4020 Basket ball dual shooting electric game. Within 2 Days one of the basketball rims came apart at the weld. Also both nets ripped within the first day, the ball always gets caught in the net and score bar. When assembling the unit one of the poles did not line up and gave me a difficult time trying to bend it in place.I should have returned it then but my son's b-day was the next day. Do not buy this unit, even if it were50$ , it is not worth it."
1,Just another Cristmas disappointment from China,"Product was missing parts when assembly was ""tried"" on Christmas Day. I blame myself. One should probably expect situations like this when the product has the wording ""Made in China""."
2,Would be great if the Electronics worked,"Right out of the box the electronics would shut off, restart, or stop working all together. Cheap electronics. Called Spalding and another is on its way. We'll see...."
3,assembly not so bad...,"didn't have much trouble assembling (actually, all parts have decals corresponding to directions). not all good news, though: the electronic scoring system worked fine for the 5 min. that i tested it christmas eve, but failed to work the following morning or thereafter. solid and fun for my kids, though."
4,Fun and durable,"For the price, this product delivers what it promises. We've had it almost a year and the kids enjoy it. We've had no issues using it, and it is holding up nicely. Took my husband 3 hours to assemble, but the pieces can be awkward to work with alone. An extra set of hands would have cut down assembly time a lot."
2,Cheaply made,"I got this for my 9 year old. It lasted about 2 weeks before the scoreboard started messing up. Sometime it records a score when none was made. Sometimes it doesn’t record a score and sometimes it won’t turn on at all. Also, I’m pretty good and fast at putting things together but this thing took a couple of hour of nonstop work and was a pain in the rear."
2,Scoreboard broke after 1 hour!,I saw reviews but took my chances. Electronic scoring scores every time ball hits rim or even hits the other rim. Worked at first but quickly broke. Now I have to try to get replacement parts. Otherwise well made but without score who cares.
5,great game,very happy with the value. the kids love it. good price point for the game in comparing it to others.
2,not durable,"This system is not long lasting it flexes and fell apart after only a few uses, instead get the Lifetime double basketball game which has a much stronger frame and construction"
1,A Piece of Expensive Junk,"I bought this for my kids for Christmas & it was a lot of fun for two whole weeks before the electronic scoring malfunctioned. It now just blinks 88, and doesn't record any scores.I called Spalding, and was told it was still covered under the 90 day warranty. When I pointed out that Amazon's product description states that there is a one year warranty, the rep told me the one year warranty applies to everything but the electronics, which is only a 90 day warranty. In addition, the part is backordered, and I won't get the part for at least six weeks.I'm extremely unhappy that I spent a lot of money on something that lasted only two weeks."
4,All but the pump,"A real chore to assemble-a definite 2 person job, good instructions. Product worked as expected, seems to be rugged enough for rough use but the pump gave out after pumping up 2 out of 6 basketballs."
4,FUN,Kids really like playing. Looks like it will hold up pretty well. Was easy to put together and so far haven't had any problems with it.
2,"Fun, but electronics malfunction!!!","This was a gift for christmas for my 3 boys. It has been a blast for them and their friends! My main complaint is the scoreboard wasn't working on the first day! One side was giving you points if the ball just touch the rim. Called the next day and they sent us a new paddle within a week! Unfortunately now the other side is doing the same thing! Only had it for exactly 1 month and it's been broken twice! I'm going to ask for some extra paddles this time incase it does it again! It is disappointing that it isn't made better. But, it's still fun."
5,Very fun,This game is a blast. Setup takes 1 1/2 with 2 people. We have it in our basement and use quite often. It works great and scoring seems accurate.
4,It's BIG!,"We didn't realize just how big this game is, so I would definitely recommend measuring your spot before purchasing. We ended up having to put it somewhere kind of in the way because we didn't measure first. But the kids absolutely love it. Mine are a little small still at the moment, but with a couple of stools to boost their height, they do fairly well."
3,The Elephant Book,"My two year old loves this book even though it's very basic. It's more entertaining than factual, however. There are references to elephant's friends, hippo and rhino, as if they frolic together. But for an elephant lover, it has some nice illustrations to look at."
2,"Uncomfortable and too small for me, 5' 9"", 140lbs.","I bought two cushions because of the high reviews. Although I didn't have any back pain, I wanted a cushion to help me sit higher at my desk. I'm not sure if there's a secret to how you're supposed to sit on the cushion, but almost immediately I felt discomfort in my knees, similar to when I sit in a movie theater chair for a long time. I tried the cushion in my car, but it didn't fit the seat properly and made for a slightly uncomfortable ride.The construction seems to be pretty good, but a larger cushion with a softer seat would probably be more comfortable. The cushion is made with a hard flat foam which could be problematic fitting on a contoured seat, however, it would probably be alright for sitting on a wooden or concrete bench.If you have back pains and think this might help, give it a try. If you're looking for a seat cushion for your office chair or car, try something else."
3,"Could be Better, and how!","This is a decent product but it seems designed for those with a small chairand a small tush. As it is, I must admit I sometimes loose my balance on it.Would have preferred a larger cushion, about 18 x 16, with a 4 inch depthmade up of 2 inches each of medium density foam and memory foam."
1,how someone did better,"They made the hole too wide, taking away too much sitting area. I know someone who got sore from sitting on it. That person did better by improvising with two folded hand towels."
1,wasted my money,this undersize piece if junk does not do the jobI am sorry I bought it and its not wide enough for my fat ass and I ama medium sized guy
1,Useless.,This item flattened out after about one week of steady use. I couldn't tell it was under me. I only weight 190 lbs.
5,Good for sciatica,"I spend about 2 hours a day (or longer) in my car. The seats in my car are not that comfortable and in turn, have amplified the pain I experience from sciatica. The only thing that has helped is this pillow. Beware that you don't see instant results; it takes about 2 weeks to notice that it is working."
3,Not as soft as I expected,I thought this item would be much softer. It doesn't feel that great if you just had surgery.
4,Effective,I was surprised how effectively this releived my back pain. Thechange in posture induced by the sloped shape was effective withina few days and continues to be a month later. If it was 15% largeri'd give it 5 stars.
3,Returned,"Returned item. It did not help my back problem. The product seemed fine, maybe it just wasn't for me."
5,Great product,"I experience pain and discomfort from Sciatica, and there was a point when it made driving almost unbearable. After doing proper stretches and changing how I bend and such, combined with the tush cush, I feel much better. I noticed an immediate difference in how I felt while sitting the car while using this product. I recommend it to anyone with lower back pain."
5,Increased my productivity!,"I do a lot of sitting and typing for work, and often got cramps in my back, and numbness in my legs. With this cushion, my legs don't get numb, and my posture at the computer seems improved. Definitely worth trying if you get stiff from sitting at a desk all day. Fast shipping too!"
1,Caves In & Creates More Stress,"After about 3-4 weeks of using this cushion continuously at work (an office job), I found that it started caving in around the coccyx hole, creating more stress. Had to stop using it, too late to return it. Could be that a person with a larger frame would just naturally sit on it more evenly, but it was not a good match for me. I won't be buying another wedge cushion with a coccyx hole. In all other respects, this is a pretty well made item though."
2,Not real silver,This is a beautiful ring but after a few wears the silver faded n turned my finger green It's not real sterling silver
5,Warm & Passionate Non-Stop Reading.,"This book's central theme affectionately embraces the potentiality of reincarnation. After all, what else could better explain the connection and the foreknowledge of little ""Duski-Dog"". Moreover, the book also exposes deeper, more profound reflections. The telling is warm and passionate. Readers will not want to stop reading this book, even after it is finished. Both heartbreaking and heartwarming, the true story could not be better told nor more tenderly experienced even if it was fiction. Keep tissues readily available, but be prepared to smile as well. ENJOY!"
1,What good is it?,"I bought an item that was never received, so I paid for a plan with nothing for it to cover.... Amazon should be better at refunding this type of thing"
3,Messed up Packaging,The movies are great but the packaging was cut. The Polar Express disk has a little skip in it where the box was cut.
5,A Desert Island Requirement,"One of my all-time top discs, I wouldn't want to be stranded without it. Full of rich, thick guitarsand Ian Curtis-like weight-of-the-world vocals, it takes me to the existential plane its title implies. Stockholm and American Money are full-on rockers that balance out beauties like Bruises. ""So many bruises that don't show, found yours so long ago."" Just good writing from top to bottom. If you get a chance to listen to the disc before this one, Pigeonhole, you'll be equally impressed with the sound, but understand why this is the one you'd trade your last coconut for."
5,Pearls before swine,"I consider myself fortunate to have, by chance, heard the song ""It's not what you know"" on local radio and within minutes making purchase here of Body Exit Mind. This band in my estimation is one of the best examples of pearls before swine in a landscape of musical redundance that encompasses pop music. They had a real groove thing going, excellent rythmic structure, powerful and poinient instrumentation and lyrics. And puffft, they were gone."
2,"Nice idea, but doesn't work","I hoped this product would ease the work of staining the deck. However, the unit leaks through to the pad which cannot hold stain so it drips - flower bed did not appreciate their shower of stain. There was no need to use the trigger, since the stain simply flowed out to the pad faster than it could be spread. Therefore, the deck boards received half again as much stain as they should. At $35/gal the stain applicator is too expensive to use. The applicator resevoir fortunatly could not be filled, since if it had even more stain would have been placed on the deck.No comment on cleaning, since it has no further use for me."
4,A Nice Case!,"This case is an excellent option for folks with a 13"" Macbook. It is fairly sturdy and your computer will be protected from the zippers. The outer pockets will hold your power supply, but it will have a slight bulge. I am primarily using this case as a slip case to put in a larger bag, but I would be happy to carry it by itself. It is lightweight and should protect your computer from bumps and scratches."
2,"Received Sportfolio for MacBook Air, not MacBook Pro","I ordered this item and received the Marware Sportfolio for MacBook Air, not the Marware Sportfolio Max for MacBook Pro. This Amazon product description does not describe an actual product that Marware currently offers.The case looks like what I would want if I had a MacBook Air, but I have a new 13"" MacBook Pro, and it doesn't fit in this MacBook Air case.Check the Marware site and then search Amazon for a product description that matches the Marware product name exactly."
4,"Fits 13"" Macbook aluminum unibody (2008) perfectly","PROSPerfect fit for aluminum Macbook 2008 (now called the Macbook Pro, I think)Rubbery ""wet-suit"" material gives plenty of padding.Has 2 pockets on either side to accommodate papers, charger etc.Good-quality construction.Looks attractive.CONSThis case is pretty CASUAL--not good for a ""suit and tie"" setting at all.Rubber material is pretty grabby, and makes it difficult to get large notebooks in and out of the side pouches.Although the side-pockets do strech, they do not accommodate a lot of things. (and if you cram a lot of things in, the sides bulge in an unattractive way--would be better to have a more conventional laptop case with larger side pockets)Overall, this case is a mid-choice between a very simple sleeve with no side pockets and a bulkier conventional case."
4,"Works great,","I used this on my Macbook and it has worked great going through airports, TSA usually lets me leave my laptop in the case and just toss it in a bin and slide through, and the material is easy enough to clean and repell spills"
2,Don't bother,"I just read one of her previous books, A Talent for Destruction. I wasn't really crazy about that one, but I love discovering new authors, or new to me, so I read this one too. I should have stopped when I was ahead.The ""plot"" involves the disappearance of a reclusive elderly couple following a bad storm. The local police almost immediately suspect the son and a former neighbor. Just when the investigation is getting rolling, a detective steals a script of the neighbors autobiography. (Which would be against any police procedure) The next 150 pages are that book! What's up with that? If you wanted to write that book, write that book. I was expecting a detective story. It was very frustrating and disappointing. I am going to avoid this author in the future."
4,Seems big but works well,"Attaches easily, looks okay, blocks out almost all sun (except maybe if on horizon), the kid is ok with it (she does not like the plastic covers for rain or for sun).Would be nice if it was waterproof also. I am afraid to use it in the rain thinking everything will get soaked.Otherwise fine. A good value and a good product."
1,A waste of money,"Too big and bulky to sit easily on top of the canopy. It may be my stroller (Maclaren quest) that it the issue, but I wish I never bought this product. My baby hates it too, because she can't see where we're walking to."
4,Not bad,"I was excited when I first received this RayShade item, however, when I attached the back, the thread was about to come off. Easily, I thread it back together. It's good."
1,Don't Bother - Pay More for Something that Works,"I read the reviews for this and decided despite some negative comments to give it a try since it was so cheap....at first I was impressed with this shade because it attached quite easily to my stroller and actually provided shade to my baby (although not as much as it looks like it would - his legs were never protected from the sun even though it looked liked they would be because the shade is so big). My stroller is a pretty typical stroller, nothing special or comlpicated about it. But yes, it did flip up in the wind or even a small breeze very easily and i had to weigh it down which didn't really work because it is so flimsy. After about 2 weeks it lost its shape completely and the front of it flipped up and no longer provided coverage AT ALL. Piece of junk."
4,Rayshade rocks,"This rayshade is excellent value for money. It carries out its main function well, by keeping the sun out of my child's eyes. Its not perfect in that it doesnt cover my child's feet but I put suncream on which does the job.I like the handy pockets at the side and its very easy to attach and fold away.I havent tried any other types of sunshades but I would certainly recommend this one."
1,Returned this product,"Save your $$ if you plan to run with this on a jogging stroller. On a mild windy day it flips up towards you and off to the side. I didn't think it really shielded my baby from the sun like I thought it was going to either. I would not recommend this product. It's very cumbersome. When I returned it to the store, there were two others on the counter behind the customer service cashier that had just been returned recently."
5,The best invention!,This product is just fantastic. I ordered it for our trip to Disney to attach onto the infant car seat for our double stroller as the sunshade on the car seat alone was not enough It was totally adjustable and stayed in place. I highly recommend it. Most importantly you can angle it just how you need it based on where the sun is and you can see the child as it doesn't block your view completely. It folds up nice and easy and can be taken anywhere. I just Love it!
2,Too Hard,I bought it after I listen to one track and was a little dissapointed that there was no variation of the flow of music. Needs to soften it up in spots and get multiple producers to keep the whole album from sounding the same.
2,did not care for,I really did not like this product they did not taste fresh . Sorry but that is how i feel i spent a lot of money to get them because i could not find them in my area. The transaction went great!! I just did not care for the product.
3,Happy but sad,"I brought this camera and the picture quality was great! The down side is the video portion only gives you seconds, but hay you didn't spend a lot for the camera. The software that comes with the camera was very easy to use and for a younger person who is just learning to take pictures and use the computer it's wonderful."
3,to previous review,if you want it to record more you need to purchace an sd card...you can get a one gb for $75.00
4,Applicator?,Oil is good. Big bottle. My only complaint is there is no applicator. I have to dip a q-tip in it and use to apply. Other than that it was just fine.
5,Important,"This Compendium is very important, great guideline for those who want to know more about what is really important in life, important for Christians and not Christians."
4,Nice!,"This is a great book!I took one star away because it's not the only book you need on the subject, and I didn't appreciate the author saying that a child being raped may have raped a child in a former life and experiencing what it's like now. That's insane and simply saying that he don't care about children being raped.But much more studies into ancient Egyptian culture is necessary to understand what Maat is and exactly how it can help us to improve our lives."
4,Good First step towards Metu Neter,"I initially attempted to study Metu Neter, but I found reading this brief book was a better place to start in my journey to know self, from a Kamitic perspective. I have found that, like the bible, every time I read it, I discover new truths and wisdom. I have read it 3 or 4 times already and look forward to my next trip through it.This wisdom within this book was most valuable in helping me realize the futility of my past failures to overcome life challenges .. and the simplicity involved in adopting effective solutions to life challenges.I come from a christian background, and do not at this point in my journey agree with all aspects discussed. But, oh, what a giant step in my journey when I first began to see that no person, place, event, or thing ... no obect from the physical world ... could disturb by at-one-ness and peace ... as long as I chose to disallow it!Hetep!"

5,New York Times Gives Book Thumbs-Up,"“In the wake of the stock market collapse, with bankers being investigated by regulators, the raw material for the next generation of Wall Street yarns is certainly ripe for literary use… Man in the Middle has the plot line of early Grisham. Its main character, Peter Neil, a callow young man, goes to work for a hedge fund, runs up against a fleet of bad guys, saves the day, and ultimately gets the girl… There is plenty of violence and sex, too. .. A pulpy financial potboiler about life in the trading trenches… [and] a lush tale of evildoing in a San Diego hedge fund, Mr. Morris’ book, according to Amazon as of June 27, 2003, had a ranking of 512,876, his sterling reviews notwithstanding.”-- NEW YORK TIMES"
2,His heart is in the right place,"Sigh, I wanted to like this book. I really did. There is a lot of room for someone to write a whole series of business books that do for business what has been overdone by Grisham, Turow, et al., in the legal world.But this book isn't it. Mr. Morris tries very hard, and that is nice to see, and he is demonstrably working his tail off, it seems, promoting the thing, but there just isn't enough there there. The characters are thin, the dialogue is dopey, and he is desperately in need of an editor to trim the thick underbrush of cliches.Lest this seem like a complete pan, it isn't. I think he has the right idea, and he seems like the sort of fellow who won't stop trying, so here is hoping book one sells well enough that on the inevitable book two he finds myself a better editor."
1,The Dist-O-map is a GYP!,"This thing is a wonderful idea. But reading the discription and seeing the item are two different things. First, although it computes the distance between ""11,000"" locations, it does it with many maps, broken down by region on many different pages. also, its incredibly fimsly, and for the price, feels like it will fall apart on the first road trip."
1,Forget It,"This product is a waste of money. It only lists mileage to & from major cities. Use the internet or the Rand McNally Atlas, which is a good buy."
5,A must read for anyone who wants to get ahead,"This entertaining story brings clarity to difficult work situations -- something we all encounter at some point. We all know the characters, and now we can recognize them. Barb McAdoo has a keen wit and a nice writing style. I found this book very helpful and find myself referring back to it often."
5,Great Business Lessons,Is is a truly well written book about common business acitivities. I think it is particularly helpful for young people just getting started in the corporate world. It should be a must read for college students. I can't wait for her next one!
5,So true!,"This book is so true! I liked the characters, and even though they argued a lot, I have to admit I recognized them in the people I work with. A great story, with lots of good lessons and not just how to solve problems, either. And as promised a fast read. I saw somewhere (her website?) that there's more coming. I hope so, I can't wait!"
3,"Like a novel version of an episode of ""In Search Of""","If you've ever seen an episode of ""In Search Of"", the funky 70's show about true tales of the paranormal, then you'll find ""Sargasso"" very familliar - which seems to capture both the mysteries of the Triangle and a very '70s way of thinking about them. The story here has a group of vacationers sailing the Bermuda triangle and encountering many of the phenomenon that comprised that area's lore (time warps, lost ships and people, UFOs and a weird cloud of...something that seems nonexistant even as it seems to get grit on everything. Many of the characters already know a thing or two about the Bermuda Triangle and its legends, which robs the story of much surprise, although you spend much of the book wondering which way the story will go. The final ending is a bit off-putting, but it was fun while it lasted, and ""Sargasso"" is actually a great beach book."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I had the extreme displeasure of hearing this cd,let me tell you it was the first stand-up comedy cd I have ever heard that actually angered me, not because of anything contreversial or offensive, just how bad it actually was. I did'nt even crack a smile through the entire cd. In conclusion, your spouse,friend,coworker ect.. is prabably 10 times funnier and deserving of a cd being published."
3,Just average,"Seriously, this is not what I'd expect from Margaret. Based on her debut ""I'm the one that I want"", this revolution is just an average. Frankly speaking, the opening act of Bruce Daniel is the best part of the show.It's kind of making me feel like she started to run out of gag and trying to do away with something to fill the show."
5,I love Margaret Cho,"She is is such a trash talking nasty woman...and I love her for it! This time she was at her funnest talking about Asian stereotypes. And I agree that someone putting you down because of your race or sexual orientation attacks you at a very fundamental level. You can get skinny, you can change your hairstyle and you can change your style of clothes. But you can't change yourself at that level. As she said if you don't go there or give out too much information things don't change.I would love to see her in person."
5,CHO IS A KNOCK OUT!!,"I consider this DVD to be worth the money. Anyone who can say...""P**sy may contain nuts or other particles of nuts..."" and still keep a straight face is a true comedian in my book. BUY IT!!!"
2,New Revolution?,"I'm a fan of Margaret's work, but I have to say that she was way off in this comedy outting. Normally her comedic timing and jokes are the things that drives fans in droves to her shows, but for some reason, she lost that in this movie. She wears an outfit that doesn't have much of a purpose, and I think the effect is lost on the audience at home.It'll still be a decent watch if you are a hardcore Cho fan, but don't expect to feel like you've experienced a revolution by the time you finish watching it. Even her normally hilarious usage of her version of her mother is toned way down. The reason this movie is not a total bust is because she still delivers hilarious lines concerning some of her social observations.This one is better left towards her huge fans, and even the huge Cho fans may feel disappointed after watching it. Although, if you are new to Cho Land, I do recommend checking out her two previous movies (""I'm the One That I Want"" and ""Notorious CHO"")."
1,What the hell in this,"Margaret must have been on something when she filmed this because she is so spacey (more so than usual) and unfocused, I am almost embarressed for her. It seems like she is not really inspired anymore and has nothing interesting to say. Worst of all, this is the film I decided to introduce my friends to Margaret Cho with and they made me turn it off 30 minutes in. There are some funny moment s in here but not enough for a comedy show. If you want to be laughing you're butt off, buy her last movie, Notorious C.H.O. That movie is probably one of the funniest comic shows ever."
2,Not funny.,"I loved the first one of Margaret Cho's DVDs, I'm the One That I Want. The second one, Notorious C.H.O., was OK, sporadically enjoyable. But this one steps down a grade and although it does have a few witty remarks, they are not worthy of the exquisite torture I was subjected to by this disc. It is not funny, and the pussy jokes don't make it better - in fact they make it worse. One good thing I noticed is Margaret lost some pounds, and got a better makeup stylist, but she should also hire better writers, because the way it is now - her act sucks through the fire hose. Maybe she is on this special medication, which alters your perception so that the nonsense she is uttering seems funny, but unfortunately my druggist hasn't got it. But I guess the DVD does serve a higher purpose, maybe somewhere in California there is a young korean girl growing up, dreaming of becoming a famous comedian, and this disc will teach her how the gigs should not be done."
3,Just not up to par,"I am a self-proclaimed Margaret Cho Obsessee... however, Revolution just doesn't make the cut. It's not nearly as funny as I'm The One or Notorious. The jokes aren't funny or as well polished as the rest of it. I'd say the best part of this DVD is the bonus features - mainly the Cho/Daniels report (Sacramento Rally Edition) and Bruce Daniels' opening act... other than that, there were a few times in this that I just wanted to turn it off... ie: the ""i shat my pants diet"" - just wasn't funny at all. So really what it comes down to is me, a hardcore Cho fan THOROUGHLY disappointed. It's only my extreme love for Margaret that I gave this 3 stars... otherwise it would have been 1 or none at all. I laughed maybe once or twice... honestly. Disappointed."
3,"Dear Margaret,","Saw your show in Columbus OH and my friends and I had so much fun! I felt the material had evolved into more physical humor, something I've always liked in your performances. You had the audience rolling and I'd say a grand time was had by all!As I watched the new DVD, my heart sank a little, because it seemed that you were a little self concious and distracted. It made me sad because so many people will watch the movie and see you not at your best. Some of the other reviews I read seemed a little harsh to me. I'm giving it 3 stars...what saved it for me was the audio commentary which I love. Anyway, thanks for the great show in Columbus and I'm looking forward to more laughs with you."
3,Worth It,"Bought this as part of a gift package for a friend who loves crossword puzzles. He has enjoyed it and I would recommend this book. Of course, it could be better but since it is the only book I have seen like it, I was grateful to make it part of a fun and funny gift set of adult books."
1,$,"This looks and sounds like a fantastic book, unfortunately the price is expensive, any chance of bringing the price down???"
1,Awful,This monitor is junk. We got it as a gift and can't return it. My neighborhood is a bit cramped and I picked up all sorts of phone conversations. Even worse the baby side made all sorts of noise making it unsuitable for use. We'll apparently have to buy an alternative that has more than two channels and doesn't have the useless two way feature.
1,Don't even bother looking at it!!,"We purchased this monitor and it is junk!!! I am soo annoyed right now...it does nothing but snap, crakle, and pop etc...It could be in a Rice Krispies commercial. I HATE THIS!We are returning it tomorrow. Don't even bother looking into this monitor."
2,dont bother,"try another model,,,everytime the phone rings (even if its no where near) it just goes off and makes the loudest static noise...scares my baby and me"
1,not good,"I bought this monitor yesterday without reading any reviews. I now I wish I had. At first, I thought it was great with crystal clear sound. Then in the past 24 hours, I have heard portions of my neighbors telephone conversations, static and sporadic buzzing sounds. I did try both channels and that did not help. I am returning the monitor tomorrow."
1,Are you kidding me??????????????,I was so excited to buy this product. I went to 3 stores to find it. I got home plugged it in and tested the intercom part. Then at nap time I hear a loud static sound coming from the children's bedroom. It was the monitor. I checked the unit and it was on. I also could hear my next door neighbor's phone conversation- not cool! The portable unit was also making a banging noice as if someone was hammering. I immediately repacked it and returned it to the store. I was so disappointed in the product. i needed a unit that had the intercom since our bedroom is downstairs and the girl's is upstairs. What a waste of time and money. I should of stuck with fisher price and spent less.
1,"""Very disappointed!""","If there is any product that you want to make sure to avoid, it is this one! Everytime I used this monitor, I could hear every single neigborhood converstion at very loud decibals. I would just get my baby to sleep and horrible LOUD feedback noises would come through the monitor in my child's room and wake him up. Unforetuntely, I don't still have the box to return it. I did end up having to buy a new monitor. Don't waste your money, time or waste sleep on this monitor."
1,The WORST!,"Like many others, I wish I would have read the reviews before placing this monitor on my registry. It is by far the worst monitor. I have been in touch with the manufacturer on numerous occasions. Someone spent $50 on this piece of junk. Without any warning it makes TERRIBLE noises on the baby's end. I would strong recommend another monitor!"
1,Horrible static on baby's unit!,"This monitor is by far the worst one I have tried! I wished I had read the reviews online before purchasing it. I liked the idea of the two way communication since we have a two story home, but the baby's unit would frequently and all of a sudden make a horrendously loud static sound for no reason. I am glad I tried this monitor out before my baby arrived. I can't imagine having this monitor around with a sleeping infant. It went back to the store and we now have the Sony Babycall 27 channel which works great."
2,2 way option is bad!!!,"I think this could be a good monitor except for the 2 way communication feature. Just as with many monitors you can pick up interferance on the parents end,but since the childs end is also a reciever it picks up interferace as well. We have been trying to use it for a week and the monitor in our sons room picks up phone conversations in the middle of the night which of course wakes him up. Not a good idea!"
1,junk,"I recieved the monitor has a gift. I used it when I was at my parents house, because the babys room is on the other side of the house. I kept hearing other peoples conversations and I thought that was normal. Then I started hearing ticking sounds, then one moring I woke up and it wasn't working. Luckly the baby was looking at her mobile just laying there. Then I would hear strange sounds coming from both ends. This is my first time using thos product and my baby is seven months old. I am very upset about this monitor........"
1,"It's a baby monitor, what's to research?","I was attracted to this monitor for it's range, price and the manufacturers brand name. Boy was I an idiot. I research everything so I don't have regrets. But, a baby monitor? Comon! they've been around for decades, what's to know? You plug it in, you listen for your kid.Yeah...Simply put, there is no way this monitor could be any worse. The feedback in my daughter's room is out-of-control. Clicking, voices, and squeals.It is a compltely useless product unless your child is deaf."
2,Worked OK for a while...,"I registered for this monitor because of the two-way feature and long distance advertised. It worked well for several months and I really liked the two way feature--very handy to call for some help when you need it (I have twins). BUT, recently it has started making extremely loud static noises, which startle/wake up the babies and mom and dad, and also picks up phone conversations on occasion. So now we turn it off and leave our bedroom door open to hear the kids until I buy a new one. Very disappointed!"
1,Do not buy,"I have a baby that can't sleep through the night because a product that suppose to make it more safe for him and his parents to sleep well, scares him out of a deep sleep constantly, so none of us get to sleep. The two way use, which is its main attractive feature, causes a feedback that is a loud crackeling noise every three seconds over and over and over. It also picks up all the neighbors and construction workers channels of conversation via phone and walkie talkie during what's suppose to be a peaceful, quiet nap time. For the sake of all Mom's during your only chances to rest, don't buy this product!"
1,soooo not worth it!!,"Like many others, we put this monitor on our registry for the two-way monitor, thinking ""wow that's cool to be able to talk to baby out of the room"". Boy were we wrong!!! The feedback, picking up cell phone calls, and radio stations in the middle of the night keeps my daughter and I both up throughout the night.I made the mistake of trying to return it, but to my extreme disappointment, Toys R Us would not take it back. Not only did they refuse to take it back, but the customer service agent had the nerve to be rude about it! I was sorely disappointed. I will have to think twice about buying anything more from Toys R Us. At least Walmart gives you the benefit of the doubt and usually tries to remedy the problem!!"
1,Worst Ever,The second I plugged in the baby unit it started making horrible noises. I am taking it back the same day. It is horrible! Is there any good intercom monitor out there?
1,this monitor is a JOKE!!,"i was so excited to have a monitor where i could talk to my children witout running up to their room 500 times a night! well it was to good to be true, i either hear one of my neighbors telephone conversations or a loud banging noise coming not only in the hand held part, but the part in the babies room!! don't bother with this monitor it stinks!!!"
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT,"This product does not work too well. IT picks up interference from other phones, radios, etc. It scares my daughter when she's sleeping. I can hear other people's conversations too, which is disturbing when you need to be using the product but can't. It really isn't that great. My husband intends to dismantle our receiver and clip the cords that allow us to talk to our daughter. We're hoping that by making it a one way system, we won't pick up so much outside noise.I would not buy this again, nor would I register for it."
2,OH WOW LISTEN TO MY NEIGHBORS,"Although I do like the features of this monitor, it just isn't worth it for me. I live in a city and quite honestly all my neighbors must have 900 Mhz cordless phones. I have tried both the channels and no matter which one I am on, I hear the conversations of all my neighbors on the phone. The voices are quite loud when they come through from other sources as well. My son and I were watching TV and when the monitor began with its possession it really startled both of us. I realized what was going on but he is still upset every time it makes a sound."
2,No Peace and Quiet,"I bought this monitor for my older kids (6 & 5) for the feature that I can talk back to my kids if need be. But one problem the kids monitor picks up on my neighbors conversation very clear, it seems that they are sitting in my house. The noise is very loud and at all times of the day which wakes my kids up in the middle of night. When this interference in going on I cannot hear my kids."
1,Horrible!,This monitor maybe worked for one day - don't waste your money! I wish I would have read the reviews prior to purchasing!!!
1,Terrible product!,"The monitor made clicking and beeping noises on both sides. It was waking up my newborn and causing us much frustration. It also interfered with our cordless phone, causing a high pitched noise when the phone rang."
1,Good for eavesdropping!!!,I have to agree with everyone else. This monitor is horrible!!!! I live in a busy traffic area and I am constantly listening to people's phone conversations. I even picked up a police radio once. Save your money and buy something else.
2,Worked great until neighbor talked on phone,"I have been searching for a good 2-way monitor. I liked the way this one worked until a neighbors phone conversation came on the speaker in my son's room. I tried switching channels, but the other channel was static.Had to return it. Why, oh, why can't someone make a good two-way!"
1,1 only because i have to this SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,we bought this because our daughters room is up stairs and we are down expecting our second. she doesnt really need a monitor any more she is three but she doesnt get out of bed with out asking first and if she has to go to the bathroom i have to go all the way up to tell her its ok with the walkie talkie feature i dont have to go up and i can hear her when she is playing. but it makes these very loud noises and you can hear everyone on the block at all hours of the night she cant sleep and we can sleep. the idea is perfect but the product sucks!!!!!!!!!!! i wish i still had the box so not worth $50.
1,dissapointed,"I have this system and I can't stand it. I have sent away for a new baby monitor and it is worse than the one I had. I hear static in the baby monitor all the time and people conversation as well as high pitched sounds. It wakes my baby up and that is not what I need to happen, now the baby is back in my room until I find a new product"
1,don't buy it,"I don't care if they're GIVING them away. Don't buy this monitor. It should be recalled. The transmitter made so much feedback noise that it woke up our daughter. We tried unplugging the cordless phones in the house, turning off the other baby monitor, etc. to find out if that was causing the feedback. NOTHING worked. So I sent it back."
5,My kids love this book,My 9 year old daughter bought this in a gift shop at Disney world. As you can imagine it cost far more than the price posted here on Amazon. It is now a favorite book; my son is 7 and is equally enamored with it. They love all the little tidbits of information about the Disney villas and their childhood/ younger days. It is fun to read the background stories that have contributed to their becoming villains. There are many fold out pictures adding even more interest to this book. If your kids like anything Disney they will love this book.
4,Disney Villians: The Top Secret Files,My daughter is 3 1/2 and loves this book. She is a princess fanatic but somehow has gotten interested in the villians. She looks at it everyday. I think it really is for an older child but she enjoys it anyway. It has many neat features that make it interactive.
3,So So video tour,This video is just okay. It's fairly informative but it is not as picturesque as I had expected.
1,asleep at the wheel,"I ordered a wiper cowl for my 2000 mustang,I was sent a cowl for a 95-03 Blazer!!not even the same car make or model. NOT HAPPY."
5,It is what it is...?,"After doing much hunting for this kit at a reasonable price, Amazon had the best deal compared to most auto parts sites. Bought it for my 03 Mazda Protege5 and my mechanic had no problem with it. He was even happy that I'd gotten the kit because it includes the other parts needed when replacing a timing belt for maintenance.Not really much more to say. It does what it's supposed to. I learned that Gates took over making these for Mazdas, so while it may not be the original oem, it's the new oem, if you will.Leaving a 5 star review so people can see that this part is legit. :p"
1,Written by an person with NO CLINICAL EXPERIENCE,"This author has flooded Amazon and Journals with books and articles without an ounce of clinical experience. She has only taught college and has never ONCE seen a real-live patient. This book, along with the others, are so far off base and have no inclusion of important DSM IV and V criteria; differential diagnosis and solid clinical experience. yet she touts herself as an expert without ever evaluating or treating a child? Impossible to believe a word in any of her publications as she is skewed in relying on only "" her teaching a a few research articles"" vs true clinical practice. yet she pontificates from her ( retired ) teaching at a small college and criticizes true experts and feels she is some type of expert. Not even licensed.....another book written by an amature and non professional."
3,Works ok,"Dust-off works well. However, due to the bitterant, it leaves a foul odor in the air when dispensed for too long. The can design needs work, if the sprayer comes off it is difficult to realign, making dispensing VERY difficult."
4,Great for those Hard to Reach Places! So Many Uses,"I've used these for years in my office but I continue to find ways to use them in the household.Perfect for keyboards, computer CPUs and the internal fans, lampshades, nick-nacks, soft display items that can't be dusted like flowers, TV speakers, desktops, and on and on. You name it, they can probably be used.The only drawback is that they can't be used for any length of time. The can gets really cold and the air pressure dies out.So you have to wait a little and then tackle the next item.A great tool to have in any house, for any work are area or even in the garage for getting those bits that fall down in cracks in your car."
4,Need canned air?,...then this is what you want. Need or want six cans of canned air? Then this is the item. Only comes with one straw. That's pretty much all I think you need to know about it.
2,Fell apart,"Cheap quality. Cap / sprayer falls off when applying pressure, effectively breaking the entire product. Smells terrible; odor lingers. Avoid and pick a higher-quality dust-off product elsewhere."
4,Comfortable,"My son loved these but we did need to return them and get a size larger. We also got ""wide"" and it didn't look wide but did fit comfortably"
3,Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms,"This book is indispensible for collectors and sellers. The text provides excellent information not found in other publications that cover such a wide variety of items. The only consistent deficiency I found is its pricing. Pricing does not match with publications printed annually that are dedicated more to current firearms value than the value of information provided by Flayderman's. As with anything, no one is always right or wrong. I recommend this book based on the historical research done by Mr. Flayderman."
3,"Great for buyers, poor for sellers","Overall the book is decent, I have found that realistically prices in this book are low (at least for early model Colt revolvers,..dragoons, 1851 Navy, 1860 Army, etc..) As this is my only area of expertise, I cannot comment on the pricing of rifles, autos, etc....This books strongest point is the amount of detail it provides."
4,Flayderman's Antique American Firearms Guide,"Lots of info. Black and white photos, could use more color photos. Would like to see a section of accessories, holsters, etc. But all in all a very nice guide book."
3,Best Reference,"Ever since the first edition, Norm's book has been the standard reference for antique American firearms. No other reference comes close to the breadth of content. Unless someone takes over, this is likely to be the last edition as Norm is getting up there in years.The index is still difficult to use as it has been since the first edition. It can be frustrating to locate information on a specific, less common, firearm. The prices listed for most items tend to be several years out of date."
4,Flayderman's Guide,"I am a CW buff, and often would look at items listed on the various sites, not knowing the details. Now I can be sure I know the model, date of mfg, value."
3,Good looking shoes,These shoes are good looking however they pinch your toes really bad. The height of the heel is low enough for them to be really comfortable shoes but they're not.
1,BANANA ACCOUNTING.,"IM MORE AMAZED EVERY DAY WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE,AFTER LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THIS ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE I EMAILED BANANA AND EXPLAINED IM NO COMPUTOR WIZ IM NOT BLAMEING THE SOFTWARE CAN YOU HELP ME ALL I WANT TO DO IS RUN A LEDGER FOR MY SMALL BUSSINESS. RETURN EMAIL EXPLAINED THAT ITS PROBABLY THE SOFTWARE NOT ME!DUH THEN FURTHER EXPLAINED HE'D HELP ME GET A REFUND FOR RETURN? IM AMAZED FIRST THE WORD PROBABLY IS SPELLED WITHOUT AN A AS WERE SO MANY OTHER WORDS IN THIS EMAIL SENT BY BANANA.I SAY ITS ME NOT THE SOFTWARE BUT BANANA SAYS IT THE SOFTWARE . GOTTA LOVE EM FOR THERE HONESTY. IM GOING TO PEACHTREE NEXT."
4,Pretty good book!,"This book is pretty good to learn Japanese with. You definitely want to get some audio from another source or purchase the audio CDs (I have not tried those). As well, I got the accompanying workbook. Do not get it unless you have some instructions or the lab CDs of some kind. You could still work with it, but there are pages that ask you to write based on what you hear. So overall, book makes it simplistic to learn Japanese and ease into the alphabets, but be sure to get another source for audio learning."
4,"Good characters, good plot, pour research","I read this book very quickly because it was hard to put down, the characters and plot were wonderful. I understand the necessity of fictional places, but please Charleston is where birth records in WV are kept. Charlottesville is in Virginia. Do your research."
4,WOW--definite must read,"This book was nail biting, breath catching suspense. I enjoyed it up to the last chapter. Then I got confused, all through the book the woman I thought was the love interest of one of the major characters, turns out to be his daughter. This left me a little confused & wary. I'm hoping the author just lost her focus. Outside of that one thing, this book left me reeling to the end."
3,ROGER CORMAN PRESENTS: SAW MEETS EDWARD SCISSORSHAND,"An engineer quits his job, rents his home and buys a junkyard in the desert without consulting his wife. Then to top it all off he plans to be a mechanic, after all how hard can that be for an engineer to be a mechanic...in the desert.(Let me know how that works out).Once you get by that, his wife, Davina Joy sports a fairly nice rack, which she is very proud of in the movie for those who require some nudity. They are worth the price of admission. The wife is eventually taken prisoner by sicko, Motorman Dan. The husband sees his wife tied to a torture chair and is forced to kill people who stop by in order to keep her alive. The husband ends up in a silly metal costume to perform the deeds.Motorman Dan has a ""Saw"" quality to him. In the movie extras we find out that while rehearsing for the movie, Motorman Dan sneezed and did a twitch which seemed to worked pretty well. So in the movie, Dan has got a nervous twitch that adds to the psycho effect."
3,Not A Good Sequel,"I was hoping the sequel would be at least as good as Machined, but I was disappointed. While the technical aspects were slightly better than the first film, the plot was a hot mess. I think the actors did great, but the lousy script really held them back. I have no idea how this became a Lionsgate film."
1,"F- grade movie, above review is fake!!!","childish movie made by childish producers, a kid could write better script than this... actors are trash, directing sucks, no special effects, no story... can we give negative stars?"
5,Hope's Floor Revive,Better than anything I have used. The shine and protection lasts for 6 months with 7 people and a dog creating very heavy traffic across the floors.
5,Works Great,"I bought this last year before we put our house on the market and used it on the hardwood floors. What a great product! No stickiness, just a nice, clean shine. I've since used it on our kitchen tile and it brings out the tile details and makes the tiles look like new."
2,DISAPPOINTED,After seeing all the great reviews for this product I thought I would give it a try. I have a room that has a hardwood floor & could use a refinish. When I first applied it I have to say it did look alot better but when it dried after about a day it looked like it did before. I guess if you don't mind applying it every day then it would be fine...but for me it would be time consuming & too expensive.
4,Works great,I received the product a month ago and put it on our wood floor by the back door where our kids constantly go in and out to play. I immediately seen a remarkable improvement over what the floor looked like before. Now it's a month later and that test area still looks great.
4,Floor Revive,"Tried this product on two types of floor surfaces - vinyl and parquet flooring. Made vinyl floor look GREAT. Parquet floor took a couple applications because it was so dried out, but now it too looks wonderful. Great product for anyone to try & good value for the cost."
4,difficult to find,"Had a hard time tracking these down. Could not find them at any hardware store in town. Great product, but I wish there was more selection available."
3,World class quality companies.,"A nice little audio on some great companies. Not only do these companies value their employees, but they work with their suppliers and customers. These companies take a lead in helping their local communities and try to produce products which are environmental sensitive. These companies are in every sense of the word world class.The cassette is somewhat misnamed since this is more than about quality. The environment along with being a good corporate citizen is also factored into this rating system. The tapes go into great discussion about the Baldrige Award and how assessments help a good company became great. Good ethics also factor into this tape. In this tape series, a half dozen companies are described and how they have become world class in a number of different areas. This is great material to review, especially for corporate executives."
5,Doesn't Shred,This is the only collar we found that doesn't shred over time from our cat scratching. It looks really pretty too with its glittery flowers.
1,Buyers Beware,"Very little moves with amateur like performers. This dvd is neither fun nor can it be classified as a workout. Total runtime is only 24 minutes and it cost around $17. Very disappointing, buyers beware of this product!"
5,Perfect for cooking with spicy peppers,"When I first started cooking with spicy foods, like habanero peppers, I made the mistake of not using gloves and then trying to take my contacts out later on. Now I use gloves whenever handling such items. These gloves fit my large hands well and work just as good as any others that I've tried and they cost much less than they do at the store. I've also had no trouble with them breaking or restricting movement. I included them with another amazon purchase so I could take advantage of the free super saver shipping."
3,Good gloves for painting.,"I buy these gloves for the sizing option. I have small hands and the big box stores sell ""one size fits all."" I do faux finishing and I need to have a snug fit. They do break though and are not durable. If I use much pressure, or a thumb or finger nail, they will puncture. I have purchased thicker gloves before and when I run out of these I will seek a stronger model. They are called ""exam"" gloves, which I thought meant that they would be thicker, however I would not want to use these if I needed a barrier from something communicable."
2,american caesar,"I hoped to use the video in history classes, but too long and boring for most students"
4,Coralif Digital Thermometer (pretty good purchase),"Having read previous reviews on this thermometer, I was a little weary, but went ahead and purchased one for my biocube 29. It is pretty accurate, and I cross test it with an instant-read thermometer a couple times a week. If I move to a larger reef tank in the future, I would probably spend a little more money for an upgrade, but this one works great for the tank I have."
1,Complete crap,"This is just a marked up horrible thermometer. If you really search, you can get this for $4 elsewhere with no name brand, same product. The fact that the tip is plastic should alarm you that it is not accurate. Why do you think every medical thermometer has a metal tip...? Because they work. I got a $3 digital thermometer with the probe made out of metal that is actually accurate and threw this one away. Once again, do research and things can be found for dirt cheap."
1,Caution: not accurate,"I have 2 manual thermometers in the tank both measuring 70F, digital reads 77.9F.I have 2 more coming directly from Hong Kong will post those results."
2,Suction cups suck...actually they don't!,The probe side suction cup doesn't stay where I put it in the tank and keeps coming off. So the probe just floats in the middle of the tank...not fun. The off button is a pain also. This is a poorly designed thermometer and I would not recommend it to others. I will look for a better one for my tank.
1,Very poor quality,"I'm not a complainer, but I had to warn others about this extremely poor quality electronic gadget. It might be low in price, but your frustration level will be off the charts. The instrument's ""power on"" button sensitivity is a joke, the battery is weak and the reading changes will drive you nuts. Corolife should be ashamed of themselves for putting their name on this product."
3,Quality,"Well you definately get what you pay for. While it tells the temp it is very slow with changes. Not sturdy, and messes up every once in a while"
1,Not genuine Coralife,"Amazon seller (uxcell) did not ship a Coralife/Aqueon thermometer. It was a knock-off, without the Coralife branding, different packaging, and the battery was running. The genuine Coralife thermometer must have the plastic film pulled away from the battery for the battery to start functioning. Seller is dishonest in describing this as a Coralife product. Amazon credited me, and I will try reordering.I reordered, and they again did not ship a genuine Coralife product. It was a knock-off, same as the previous order. Amazon has been alerted to this issue, and will be investigating."
2,Worked for about 2 weeks,"I got this thermometer because the cheap thin glass tube one for my tank broke very easily one day while i was cleaning the tank. So, I got a digital one thinking it wouldnt break as easy. This thermometer has a small compact watch battery in the back, and after 2 weeks it stopped working. That was long enough for me to make sure the heater in the tank was working and was keeping the temp regular, but I am not going to bother to replace it and I do not suggest purchasing this product unless you don't mind having to change the battery all the time. To me, wasn't worth it"
3,Bulky for the outside,"I found no real way to hide the bulkiness of this product along with the prob and the wire, so I wnet back to my old magnetic thermometer."
1,Accuracy degrades badly over a year (10+ degrees F),I've owned it for over a year. It is over 10F low. Seems to be getting worse over time. Was better when new - within ~2F. Changing batteries didn't help. No way to recalibrate. Waste of money!!!
5,Very accurate!,"I've had it for a month now in my tank, and the readings match almost exactly with the temperature I set in my heater; unless both are wrong, the reading is very precise! I still have to test using another thermometer, but just to make sure;So far the batteries are working fine and no sign of wearing out; and you can always turn it off whenever you want; I turn it on only when I want to know the temperature, and then turn it off again; this will save you lots of batteries in the long run;Definitely better than those ""temperature stickers"" that we can never tell what the real temperature is, and all this for a very reasonable price!!"
2,economical,"I BOUGHT 2 OF THESE THERMOMETERS, BOTH ARE IN THE SAME TANK AND THEY BOTH HAVE DIFFERENT READINGS BY 2 DEGREES F. BUT I GUESS ITS OK FOR THE PRICE."
1,Wildly inaccurate - 10 degrees off,"Right now it's 82 degrees in my tank, and this thermometer shows 72. Could not recommend, it will kill your fish."
2,Your finger is more accurate!,"This product is great if you want a digital thermometer, but accuracy isn't important. If you do, for some crazy reason, want it to be accurate, try another brand. The only good point is that, while it is wrong, it is consistently wrong, so at least you will know if there is a temperature fluctuation."
5,Small and Precise,This is perfect for any size aquarium. It is a simple yet sleek design and it has worked great. The cord is long enough for it to work with any size tank. It has worked perfectly for us for the last year and it is still going. Great Product.
2,"Inaccurate, disappointing","After using the suction-mounted glass thermometers for years, I was sucked in by the concept of a digital thermometer. Fantastic idea, poor implementation. They're great if you need a rough estimate. Personally, I'd like my equipment to be as accurate as possible."
5,Works very quickly! Accurate,"I actually got this to measure the temperatures in various rooms in my house since our A/C works very unevenly. It's spot-on (within 0.1 degree) of the stated temp on our thermostat right by the main unit and shows me just how hot the other rooms are in comparison. It updates quickly and is a solid little product. You do have to remove the plastic between the battery and contacts before it will work, so just FYI."
3,poor quality control,"This otherwise excellent set is marred by an audio problem on ""The $50,000 breakfast"". The original show mix is combined with the music and effects mixouts causing the music and effects to be too loud and phasey.After A&E; did this on one of the early Prisoner releases, I had hoped they had tightened up on their quality control.Thanks A&E.; This episode is pretty much unwatchable."
1,Not good for gel polish soak off,I use gel polish and you are supposed to soak off gel polish with acetone. This acetone did not soak off very well. Cutex acetone worked much better. I was just looking for something cheaper than the gelish harmony acetone remover so I tried this.
4,It's fine.,"What can I say, acetone is acetone. They didn't send me the one in the picture though. Kinda slow on shipping too."
3,It's okay.,"I'd get a local drugstore brand acetone next to compare. Maybe I'll be back to Supernail after that?I had trouble removing a salon UV gel mani. It took two soaks and my cuticles were naturally showing stress. Le fumes, le fumes! The bottle has changed in appearance from the photo - a design update, shorter and wider.Anyway... I got that sucker off, mostly. Phew."
5,Good. It's acetone.,Good value for a large sized bottle.Seller shipped quickly and with good packaging. It is normal acetone. I used it for both nail polish remover but also to remove stains in granite.No complaints.
5,Great Acetone,"It is so much better than store bought. It is stronger, but what you need for shellac nails. It does the trick!!!!"
3,No complaints,"I have never looked for pure acetone before, so I didn't know if it was available anywhere else. I have since seen it in a store, and i think this was a little more money than the one in my local store... but it was convenient at the time and it's everything it's supposed to be"
3,good introduction book,nice book for introduction. a little bit too much detail though.I usually scan the book first and come back to read the details.
4,Good for controversial topic,Good read but a financial background or training is a must to appreciate the ideas inside.
1,Straps unsafe and very squeaky wheels,"When you see this many unfavorable reviews, you have to think twice. I would not recommend this product. We got rid of it as soon as we could."
4,"I bought it, I used it, It worked great","Okay, first time mom, wanted all the best stuff, and I wanted it to match. For those people w/complaints about the straps. I called Eddie Bauer when I had that problem and they apologized for my inconvenience, notified me that they had ""recalled"" the straps and sent me new ones overnight at no charge. They even talked my husband through replacing the old ones.The only ""problem"" I had with this was that I used it SO much that the wheel started to squeak. I started carrying PAM around w/me to spray on the wheels when they got too noisy.I LOVED this stroller. The ""spring loaded"" carrier underneath allowed me to store all my packages at the mall without waking my sleeping infant. Priceless!"
4,"the stroller is great, carseat not so great","my son quickly outgrew the carseat (he is a very big boy), but i do remember having some issues with the straps. now i just use the stroller. my wheels are not squeaky, and i don't find that it's heavy like some other people. i get it out of my trunk with one hand! while baby is in the other arm. i can also open it with one hand, which is convenient when you're holding baby in the other. i love the parent cup holders, i use them for keys and cell phone. the underneath storage is great, lots of room. it also seems to be very comfortable for my son. the footrest that flips out from the front is nice while we take our walks. our neighborhood is only about half paved with some very big curbs, and this stroller handles it like a champ! i recommend this product."
2,Not what I hoped for...,"I've had the same problem the previous reviewer mentioned. The straps on this infant seat adjust themselves after a few days of getting baby in and out and eventually come undone! This happens at least once a week! I plan on calling the manufacturer this week to complain- and I urge anyone else who has had this problem to do the same (that's how recalls happen!) It scares me to think what could happen if we were in a car accident and the strap holding my son chose that moment to come undone! The infant seat is also fairly heavy. I have not had any problems with the stroller, and overall- do like the look of both the seat and stroller...but would strongly caution anyone thinking of buying this infant seat!"
3,Nice looking but not sturdy,"We own the eddie bauer travel system. I wouldn't recommend this stroller to my friends. The wheels wobble, squeak terribly and are showing a lot of wear. My baby is only 7 weeks old so it hasn't been used over a long period of time. I'm very disappointed in the product. I wouldn't buy this stroller again."
5,This is the Lexus of strollers...,"My mom bought this for me as a shower gift. I only saw the picture of it online, and couldn't really tell what it looked like or the material, but the description seemed like it was everything I needed. When it arrived, my boyfriend put it together pretty easily (there was a lot of assembly, though). We were amazed. It's very light and sturdy at the same time. I couldn't tell by the picture, but it's got front shock absorbers which is awesome since I do a lot of walking. The handles are very cushiony. When you have the carrier attached to the stroller and you have both bonnets opened, it shields the baby from any sort of wind or rain or snow. (I live in Iowa, and I'll be having my baby in November.) All of the material is very strong and an eye pleasing color as well. The buckles in the carrier are very strong as well. There's 2 of them which I feel provides extra safety. (Always a plus!). This is a great buy for the money!"
1,"Unsafe seat, and bad customer service","I received my travel system for a shower gift in September. The stroller worked okay, but the carseat..oh my gosh! The straps come loose every time I used it. I was under the impression this product had been recalled (misunderstood) and I contacted my local Target. The manager advised me to bring the stroller back for an exchange, no problem. When I attempted to do so today, I was told there was no recall on this by an extremely rude worker. Glad I've given them so much of my business."
1,DANGER!!!,If you've had problems with this unit's saftey report to www.NHTSA.dot.gov and report it so we can try to get this thing recalled before a baby gets hurt or worse. My son is two months old and I barely go out so I just noticed the straps don't work properly. His left strap is always comming undone. I used a saftey pin to temporarily remedy this until I can return it. The wheels also squeak. My main concern is my child and other potential parents who are unaware of the danger. You don't know the strap is defective until its come loose and it doesn't come loose right away. It comes loose when you've been driving and you can't imagine the horror of thinking your baby has been riding without restraint. RECALL won't happen unless you report it.
1,My straps come undone too.,I also wrote a review before complaining about squeaky wheels. I called the manufacture and they told me they would send new wheels to me back in October.... I just received them in December. <br />My straps come undone too!! I wish the manufacturer or Target would recall this product before babies are injured. <br />I will not buy Eddie Bauer products again.<br />
1,If I only read the reviews,"If I had only read the reviews, I would have avoided this stroller system! I have the same problems as nearly everyone else: the straps constantly come undone, the wheels squeak despite lots of WD-40, the carseat is so heavy even without the baby in it, one set of fronts wheels is shorter than the others so it is REALLY difficult to steer, and the plastic flap that holds up the bottom of the car seat when it is attached in the stroller often doesn't engage so that the carseat falls. All in all I think it's a poorly made product and Eddie Bauer should be embarrased to have its name associated with the darn thing."
2,"***Unsafe*** RECALL, RECALL, RECALL","We bought this ""high-end"" travel system when our first child was born last year. I shopped around a lot, but believed in the Eddie Bauer and Target reputation for quality. I agree the system is well thought out and very convenient. However, like many of the reviews on this page We first notice the squeaking wheels, premature wheel-wearing, and the flimsy canopy, and the ""non-stabilized"" base belting system...but worst of all was when my wife arrived home from a 3.5 hour drive to find my son completely unsecured in his seat due to the rear harness restrain system slipping out of the retainers AGAIN!!! This is a safety nightmare and not only shouldn't Target sell these, Eddie Bauer should do a recall before both companies cause the unnecessary loss of a child's life.I had intended to use this for our second child well-on-the-way, but will now write the manufacturer and Target to request a full refund."
2,STRAP PROBLEMS!!!!!!!,"For those of you having problems with straps coming undone: As a temporary fix, my dad strung the straps through kind of backwards (or inside out) on the back of the car seat- and the straps haven't come loose since then. But I still urge everyone to contact the manufacturer about the problem!"
1,not good for nyc license,"I studied this book it has good information but not for the new york city exam, out of all the practice questions maybe 1 was on the exam, they should updfate or at least no whats on the exams ."
5,Great Book,"I bought this book for less then fifteen dollars and it was the best fifteen dollars I've spent. I recommended to two of my co-workers. The book is easy to follow; has plenty of diagrams, illustrations and details to understand what's going on. The best part is the quizzes at the end of each section. The quizzes make sure you're paying attention. I'm an architect by training, and now I'm pretty confident that I can follow along with a conversation about a refrigeration system."
4,Just another HVAC book,"I bought the book to study for my refrigeration license exam. The book is packed with everything from ""what is a BTU?"", to a list of all refrigerants, to the federal ANSI/ASHRE code, Absorption systems, compressors, and Math formulas.This book is not designed to help the experienced tech pass the license exam, there is just too much info to go over. This book is more geared toward someone who knows little about the trade overall and wants to learn about the trade.I ended up studying just the ANSI/ASHRE code and passed the test. Overall its a nice book and I just may have bought the wrong book."
4,great camera,"I took this camera to Hollywood, Ca and Florida and NY. I have great pics from everywhere and everyone! It worked for me! Downloading them to my computer was so easy. And than putting them on my digital photo frame completed my wonderful pic collection."
2,Ok for the Price,"It is a cheaper camera so for the price it does a decent job.But I would say about 60% of my pictures come up blurry when the target isn't moving, 100% when target is moving. No matter what mode it is in. So if you are buying this to take pictures of your kids it is a bad purchase."
3,it's okay but i realy like the title,not to sure about the stuf actualy encoded in the cd but i realy like all of the stuf on top of the cd!! twix rocks though the music is okay i think it would be better if it wre a little more upbeat in someplaces. and a little bit slower in some. it gets confuseing!
5,A must for the Plastic Surgery Resident,"This book covers all the basic info that a plastic surgery resident should know, in a small, pocket size book. You can carry it over, and let's you do quick reviews of diagnostic and therapeutic measures while on the move.I definitely recommend this book as an aid to have on the go, besides the basic books you should have in your shelf for a deeper reading."
2,Meet me at the quad after the surgery,"After a corn thresher accident, I turned to Michigan University students to do my reconstructive surgery.(Wolverines!) Two years later, if asked to describe the experience, I would have to say.....YOU BUTCHERS! YOU BUTCHERED ME! I knew better than to let medical students do my surgery, but I was broke after trying to do it myself.I thought since they had just beaten Florida in the Capital One Bowl, we all felt like we could do anything we put our mind too. I guess we were wrong. Rich Rodriquez and 1st year med student ""Mayday"" Montana are classic choke artists. Stopping Tebow was nothing like stopping my bleeding. Putting the ""clamp"" on Percy Harvin was easier than clamping my femoral artery. In the end, I guess we fans and victims probably feel the same way: We'll give you one more try, but that's it."
2,So frustrating!!,"I was disappointed and find that it spoiled my own happy Peter Pan fantasies.It was an interesting idea but I do not love the story the author chose to tell. Intentionally or unintentionally, she doesn't show Peter's charm or attraction or display any reason at all why these women would have loved him so much that they would attempt suicide and go crazy once he left them. I didn't understand the -why- of their bizarre dynasty. And then the author gives the narrator this awesome, tough, no-nonsense daughter and I would really have enjoyed reading a story about her adventures in Neverland, kicking Peter's rear into shape or going off and doing her own thing on the island if all they'll grant her is domestic servitude. But the author chooses not to explore this path at all. Then why create such an awesome character with such potential? Is it just to drive me nuts?"
5,Keeping your brain in shape !,"If you expect tons of memory excercises, this is the WRONG book for you. This book is about keeping your brain healthy, in shape. It's about UNDERSTANDING MEMORY, ESTABLISHING MEMORY, PRESERVING MEMORY and last but not least, EXERCISING YOUR MEMORY. My best take-aways;- non-sense and truth about the aging brain- the danger of drinking coffee on an empty stomach- when to take Calcium & Magnesium best- memory and motivation- the effect of sleep & excercises on memory- protecting your memory from overload in a high-speed worldFantastic book for everyone interested in taking care of ones brain/memory health."
3,Hard to believe that so many ppl found this book to be 5 stars,"I think I'm being pretty generous for giving it 3 stars. I realize that there are as many opinions as there are ppl but other than some general good advice on lifestyle change and communication with ppl, I didn't find this book to be very conductive to memory improvement. The book is very lengthy and doesn't grip you, which makes it very difficult to not loose attention. But the worst part is that when it finally comes to suggesting some techniques on memory enhancement, the explanations aren't very clear at all. So, I spent a lot of time reading the book and didn't take too much out. Sorry to say that."
1,Forget it.,"Do not buy this book. It is hopelessly padded and repetitious, and forgets to keep the promise of its title."
4,Stuffed toy Bee,"I bought this little toy for my great niece, and she loved it, its very cute and soft... im thinking of getting one for myself for my bee collection..lol. its perfect for a child to take to bed and cuddle. bright yellow is easy to see. easy to wash. an overall cute fun toy."
4,Handy for The Kid,"I got this dictionary for my 8 year-old son. He hates dictionaries, but this one seemed a little gentler for the kid who wants to know everything, which ironically he is. At the same time, it's not for little kids, and that's why I got it. Now he's 10, and he'd much rather use this dictionary than mine. For one, he likes that it's his, but it's also a bit easier to use than the giant archaic Webster's we have."
2,Not sure about this one,"I love Jennifer Kries other Method Pilates DVD. Her instruction is great and we are constantly moving.She talks wwwaaayyyy too much on this DVD for me. I don't like being lectured during my exercise routine. Too much inaction as I have a limited time and I had to fast forward to the moving parts.I read lots of yoga books and also read about other types of exercise. When it is time to move, I want to move."
3,"Probably ok if you can handle the ""crazy talk"".","So far I have only watched the first portion of the video which guides you through some self-massage (which seems reminiscent of traditional thai massage for those who are familiar). Now, I would love to do that routine if only every other sentence did not refer to nonsense like energy circuits and conduits (I think that's what your hands and feet are supposed to be). Apparently energy gets stuck in our elbows, did you know? Anyway, if that sort of stuff doesn't bother you, I'm sure this is a wonderful workout/routine."
2,Night and Day from the first album,"Was very disappointed when I first heard this album as it is very different from the first.As I write this I think it is topping at 39,000 in the Amazon list of most popular album sales. I didn't even know there were ever 39,000 albums every made.Rather than getting something original and unique we get stale bubble gum. YukThis now sounds like one of those rock bands one finds playing at clubs with $2 cover charges.Oh well - too bad"
2,Another Sophmore Effort That Falls Short,"Like the Killers and the Bravery, the Click Five have managed to hit dullsville on their second album. The replacement of the lead singer, always a band's identity, is a major problem, as are the songs. Only ""Flipside"", ""Jenny"", and ""I'm Getting Over You"" manage to get above the waterline here. One other track, ""Headlight Disco"", shows promise, but in a completely new direction a la Shiny Toy Guns. If the Click Five want to be anything more than a novelty band they better find a direction and stick to it, and soon. And bringing back the original lead singer wouldn't be a bad move either."
3,better at the time,this sounded cool at the time but the music and sound haven't aged well.i enjoyed sign o the times better.
3,lip synched,"yea - all the songs are there but.......cmon admit it, most of the singing was lip synched and i dont think his guiter was plugged in wasnt it?"
4,Okay...,"it's a bit kitsch... but the band plays soooo good !and it reminds me the good times I've spend with my first girl friend.Christine, if you read this, this one's for you, babe !"
3,It was pretty decent,"I'm a Prince fan, but too many times in this concert Prince got abit boring with all his random talking. It left me feeling like..fast fowarding through all the gabber-jawing."
4,Just As Good As The Movie,"I loved this concert, Prince sings all of the great hits from the film ""Purple Rain"" and his other greatest hits. The Revolution is a great band as well and I loved Sheila E on the drums. The music is really good and so is the whole show. See it if your a Prince fan."
2,Prince & the Revolution Live (VHS),"Due to technology not being very good back in the 80's compared to now the video was very poor quality. When the lights are down which is throughout most of the concert, the video is very blurred and you cannot see Prince or anyone elses face, but when the bright lights are on you can see them very good. Too bad the lights were bright most of the video. I didn't realized most of this was going to be out of focus or else I would not have purchased it. I did purchase Prince's video Rave un2 the year 2000 and that is an EXCELLENT concert video. If you are a Prince fan that is the way to go."
1,Beating a dead surgeon,"By this time the novelty of MASH had gone by the wayside. The movie had been nominated for an Academy Award and the TV series was in the works. Hooker was trying his damnedest to continue milking the cash cow, but its time was long past. You have to give him credit for trying, but taken out of the wartime scenario, the MASH characters become instantly forgettable."
1,Not worth reading,"I loved the TV series and thought that the movie was pretty good so I took this book out of the library when I saw it there. I read about half of the first page, read a paragraph or two on a couple of other pages and will be returning the book to the library tomorrow. Life is much too short to waste time reading garbage like this."
3,Sure Stop,"It workds fine, though when I hvae been practicing for several hours it begins to move. I was not aware that rubber stoppers are better than these."
5,Need more!,My son plays the cello... and this works great on the hardwood floor when he practices. I need to get another one so he can keep one at home and leave one in his case for when he plays elsewhere. It does what it's supposed to... and much easier to use than the ones that you have to adjust each time you use it and tether it to a chair...
5,Another Overlooked Winner !!,"Length:: 3:23 MinsThis little gem is a great utility knife that can skin, bushcraft and campcraft. The hollow grind, drop point blade is 3.5"" long with a 3.25"" cutting edge. ** WARNING ** It came razor sharp out of the box! The plastic handle has rubber inlays which makes it extremely grippy and comfy.But the real cool feature is the one handed release, roller locking plastic sheath. The spring mounted roller rides up the ricasso and locks into the finger grove when fully inserted. It will not accidentally come out! A push on the edge of the sheath with your thumb pops it loose with just one hand.The sheath has a nice horizontal drain hole which can accommodate a lanyard for a neck knife hang. One handed release also allows for belt, pack or boot mount.The knife and sheath weigh next to nothing and the cost isn't far behind. I highly recommend this knife!"
3,I'm sure there's better...,"There's a big difference between writing a biography and transcribing conversation by the subject into book form. This book is the latter. While it is certainly entertaining from an anecdotal standpoint, there simply isn't enough meat here to grab one who is wishing to dive into the creative process that made Fellini's films what they are. This book is by no means scholarly or academic. If you seek deep insight into his films, look elsewhere. If you're entertained by casual chat, this is your book."
2,boring,i love morgan fairchild - she is still gorgeous today but this movie was just plain boring. i could not bring myself to spend a couple of hrs watching it and simply put it off. the only reason i am keeping it in my collection is because morgan fairchild plays in it.
4,Tricky to get to work,"Getting this set up is a long trial and error process. I bought this for the sole purpose of stripping 28 AWG stranded wire from inside USB cables. Fortunately, I was able to get it fully tuned on the junk wire I didn't need.Like all tools, using it takes some practice. I think my 28 AWG spot is a little looser than a preset tool would be, so I end up nipping the stripping point around 10 times or so to avoid severing any of the super small inner wires. I have it set well enough for me, and I don't think I will ever change it.Pros:-cheap-gets the job done-can be extremely flexible in operationsCons:-yellow handle means I mistake this for my other yellow handle strippers-difficult to set at just the right spot-needs a flat head screwdriver to reset the stop point"
5,I love this cage,"I bought this cage for my 4 parakeets, it arrived 3 days later no instructions but was very easy to assemble. It arrived in the morning and I put it together in the afternoon and my birds moved in soon after that very same day and have been very happy ever since.I would recommend this cage to my friends."
5,Very Cute,"Not only an adorable ornament, but my daughter has it clipped to her softball bag. It is hard to find a lot of softball items - this one was really cute!"
2,So-So...next time buy better,"The discs started burning fine on my liteon 8x burner.Then I got 2 coasters, thought it might be Nero 6.3.0 giving me problems...NOTThese discs do burn at 2.4x and sometimes 4x, but unless you want a $2 coaster, burn at 2.4x.Or buy some better quality media, like I will be doing when this spindle is gone."
3,I think this works for some people.,"I bought this product for my father. He has dark spot in his face. He tried many products to remove his dark spot in his face. But this product did not work as like other products. After then, my mother started to put this cream in her face. My mother has kind of dark skin tone. She wants to have whiter skin tone. And it worked. Her face tone got little whiter. She's happy with this product."
4,Snappy Title,"It's a good book, get more, read them too. Spend some quality time in the lab.I strongly disagree with the comments of everyone uses software now so you dont really need an in depth understanding of geometrical optics. Brains and hands...not keyboards and software."
4,A good book if you're not in a hurry...,"The best thing about Hecht's book are the long and thorough discussions about every topic. This makes the book very adequate for self studying. On the other hand, it can be very incovenient if you're using to book to study for your exams (as I did). So I do recomend Hecht as a first reading in Optics, but be sure that you're not in a hurry..."
1,bad book!!! wasting time!!!,it is difficult to learn from. NO examples are found and I often found myself reading a section several times and still not feeling confident that I understood it.
2,"Good text, bad book","It's hard to give this book more than two stars. The material in the book is solid; other reviewers have gone into that at length. On the other hand, the book's construction is flimsy, and the text layout in mine is filled with errors. For instance, numbered equations are supposed to be surrounded by grey boxes. But the alignment is completely off, so the grey boxes appear in the middle of paragraphs. The book isn't in color, which is okay, but for a book this flimsy and this poorly put together, it's pretty expensive at $120. A book that is quite good, quite cheap, but not as complete as Hecht is an Introduction to Modern Optics by Fowles. I'm also not convinced this book is as good as Born and Wolf. It's not that bad a text, but the book part of it is really bad. I would suggest not buying a new copy, or trying to rent it or take it out from the library... spend your money on a higher quality book.Let me know if you have any questions in the comments!"
1,Not what I expected!!!,I read the reviews on this DVD and it sounded great. My husband and I watched it and we were disappointed. I thought it was going have more of a sexual story to it then just sex. They were real people but I wish it had more a of a story to it.
2,Interesting,Worked well as a contrast against the standard/mainstream. Lives up to being an erotic documentary. But that's about it.
2,Much ado about nothing,"I am sorry for all of the aficionados, this isn't that great of a movie, waaaayy too much talking that practically puts you to sleep. The sex isn't all that.Save your money, get something else.Unsatisfied"
2,Save your money,"I'm surprised by these glowing reviews. They inspired me to buy the film, but I found the film itself deeply uninspiring. I bought it to watch with my boyfriend-- and we're new to couples' porn, so I wasn't after anything too intense-- but it was 28 minutes (28 minutes for $24!) and astoundingly dull. The commentary between the husband and wife is interesting for a glimpse into the real life of people in the porn industry, but neither their conversation nor the sex scenes are arousing to any notable degree. Mainly, as another reviewer wrote, they talk about the relatively ""vanilla"" nature of their home sex life, and about the corresponding intimacy. They seem to love each other and enjoy the sex, but, as a viewer, there isn't much to be excited about. I certainly won't buy any other Comstock films, despite the giddy reviews, and I'm returning this one."
1,Stupid,"Don't waste your money on this dud. I thought it was a ripoff in that the running time was under 30 minutes. The whole movie was stupid. Somehow, I thought it would have more of a story line. What was I thinking!"
2,shirt,"Same as my Snoop Dogg shirt purchased here, this screen shot was not as clear as the image on the shirt online."
5,You could use these for an air freshner.,"Although it would be an expensive option just to make your house smell pretty.I use these beans to make my own vanilla extract and they work great! Cost effective, nice light but full vanilla flavor and just the ticket for my next batch."
3,Not a bad unit,Just about what I expected at the price. I use Simple Green in it - solvents are not usable w/ this w/o a serious hazard. After a year is has some rust in it but has held up well considering I wash fairly heavy parts in it. The pump system works fine and looks like it will last for a while. Good pressure out of the unit. I would recommend getting hose/brush with it though.
2,Larry Walker,"bottom platform was warped, bat doesn't fit in hand. If I would of seen it it first would not of bought it,"
2,poor construction,wasted all but one trying to punch through with a paper punch like the instructions said. The 2 that came already punched out work great but I ended up using black card stock and the aperature rings that came with the lensbaby to hold in my punch outs instaed of this kit. Do not buy unless you just want the heart and star.
5,"Awesome company, awesome product!","Not only was the price of the apertures low, but the company offered FREE shipping, which is awesome!!! They were delivered super fast in perfect condition. I would certainly buy from them again. My budding-photographer-husband will have a lot of fun playing around with these.Lensbaby Creative Aperture KitThanks for the great experience!"
4,very usable,"Although I have not installed this item yet, it apears to be very usable. I did not realize that it was a totally plastic part."
3,spread the warmth,"bought this along with the mojave heater so i could defrost my windshield. it works well at directing the heat but is not perfect in that the heat must be diverted to the side outlet closing off the direct heat to the cabin. on my chevy tracker i had to install a ""Rube Goldberg"" like affair of plumbing elbows tubing and plastic pipe to get the heat up to the window. silly looking but it works reasonably well.the plenum does add about four to five inches to the heater thus making mounting a little trickier on a small vehicle like the tracker. i took out the glove box to make room.overall i'm pleased with the functionality of the unit."
1,Does not fit 85 Brat,"This says it fits an 85 Subaru Brat, but it is completely wrong. It's too short and has this plastic guide on pedal side that isn't on the original."
4,This book gets an undeserved bad rap,"This book has been pummelled by reviewers who hate Curt Smith's writing style. Granted, sometimes he writes like someone in a mental hospital stitching phrases together in bursts. Other times he writes like your buddy telling stories in a bar. Because of the huge scope of content (ie. the entire history of baseball told via a tour of its ballparks), this clipped style works. At over 500 pages, this is still a weighty read. I would have given it 3 stars, but it earns a 4th one for the cool colour inserts that show a couple dozen paintings of historic and current stadiums at gametime."
1,A disappointment,"""Storied Stadiums"" is the most poorly written book I've read in quite some time. To illustrate, here's one example among many:""Note merely how offspring spurred the pastime's throb. Brooklyn baseball began a century before proving that even in the fifty-second World Series-Game Seven, October 4, 1955, Brooklyn 2, Yankees 0, after losing seven straight Series, five to New York-a franchise could run into luck"" (page 20).One must work extremely hard to deconstruct the author's circuitous (and sometimes inexplicable) line of thought and the device of using various song titles to introduce each section seems rather silly.Considering the author's qualifications, I would have expected a more polished and professional style. Quite disappointing on the whole."
1,Learn how to write,"Curt, I loved Voices of the Game and Storytellers, but you lost your way on this one. How about this sentence: ""Classic parks forged a Mayberry of puppies and emerald turf and picket fences and small-town marms -- frozen in amber, but fixed and sure.""WHAT? Claptrap....pure and simple....and that was only page 3.My real favorite was ""If Bogart means Key Largo, baseball can mean year."" HUH? At least match the verb syntax, Curt. Fantastic research, but you need to relearn writing for the reader. For God's sake, tell your editor(s) to find a new line of work."
1,DON'T BOTHER!,"I only wish I had read the reviews before buying this book. Very rarely will I put a book back on the shelf without finishing it, but this book is one of those rare exceptions. It seems to me that the author has forgotten one of the most important rules in writing, ""write to express, not impress."" He takes so much time being clever and amusing that the true stories of these glorious stadiums are lost in unreadable rhetoric."
1,Unreadable,"Don't waste your money. As many of the other reviewers have noted, the book is ponderous, and downright unreadable. I honestly don't know how he managed to get this published. Perhaps he had photos of someone that he used for blackmail. Honestly, you could pick just about any paragraph from the book and excerpt it as an example of his choppy, staccato, disgorging of facts, anecdotes, and bad puns. The author obviously thinks very highly of his own wit, and can't let a paragraph pass without trying to slip in some sort of pun, or play on words. Horrible. Absolutely, horrible."
1,Do NOT buy if your are not sure of compatability,"Please check the itech website first for a list of compatible phones before purchasing this item, I bought it for my Treo 680 and it wont recognize it. I even tried it with a Sony z525 and a Motorola RAZR, and it still wont pair up, so be sure."
1,Motorola V3 Phone cannot find this device,"I have been looking for a Bluetooth headset for a while. I like this unit simply because this type of the design eases the burden on my ear. After I received this unit. I tried to pair rhis unit with my Motorola V3 for three hours but I still cannot get them to recognize each other. Moreover, the ""MFB""(Multi-function Button)on the clip won't function anymore after serveral on and off.I ordered this unit with Amazon's one day service for the reason I have to go for my Christmas trip two days later. The freight cost more than the unit price already. It is really wasting my time.Sincere suggestion: Don't buy this if you are using Motorola V3."
3,Great Idea But,I bought two. One works still although it loses it's connection with my phone sometimes. Also is no longer found automatically by my phone. It's a great concept and alternative to the bluetooth on the ear trick. I like it overall.
1,Clickie background noise,Returning this one. Clickie background noise and it sounds like you are in a tunnel.
5,Very Confortable,Nice product. Excellent battery Life. The best thing you don't have a transmitter just a side to the most sensitive part of your brain.
5,Surprised - but very positively so.,"I have gone through several Bluetooth earpieces for my Treo 650 in the past year and this one has ended up as my favorite. When I first started, I bought one and traded it in because I was dissatisfied which the first few. Then I kept one out of frustration rather than satisfaction and lived with it for several month until I lost it. After a few months without one at all I decide to get another. I spent the money on one that looked sexy and was highly rated. But again, the sound quality wasn't satisfactory. When I saw ad on Amazon for the iTech clip at such a low price I decided to give it a try as a backup and am happier with it that any other. It isn't sleek and sexy and discrete, but actually seems more practical than the standard design. I imagine that having the mic clipped to my shirt right below my voice works better than over on my ear especially with wind or car noise. And the clip design makes it easier to not lose."
1,iTECH Clip IIe (Glossy Black w/ Silver Button) Bluetooth Headset,"This headset gives a lot of static compared to the other one I have. It was easy to sync with sony/ericson phone, but the sound is just not good."
4,Very good.,Very good product. Easy to set up and easy to use. The battery life is long. Simply a very good product.
2,Does she ever shut up?,"I think she was a little too ambitious and excited to ""impart her vast knowledge"" of wisdom to the viewer. Where's the workout? One has to put up with her detailed and long explanations about how wonderful and meaningful each activity is before evern getting to try it. There are some workouts that claim to be express, but you still have to put up with an overdrawn explanation before each and every one. And some activities themselves take only a few minutes. She tries to explain that this is the ""First in her series"" and promised the next video will be much more fluent. Well, I'm sorry Jen...I didn't buy this with the understanding that I'd have to buy your videos like I buy the book of the month.In and of itself, it could have been a good beginner video, but she tries to cover sooooooo much.Next time Jen, try writing a book. Oh maybe you have, I really don't care...sorry. --Rose"
1,not encouraging,"The product comes with this little tag ""...hand crafted, sun dried, and kiln-fired so it never wears out!"".It started wearing out after the first use. I won't buy this again. To bad you can't leave pictures here."
3,Worked great til' it broke apart,"This was my 2nd Terra Cotta Pumice and it only lasted for 2 uses before it broke into 3 pieces. Normally I would have said this is an awesome foot scrub, but I am very disappointed about this particular pumice. I wrote Gilden Tree about a replacement or a refund 3 days ago and have not heard back from them...poor quality and poor customer service."
2,Will use as bath decoration,"Looks nice next to the tub however using it was a different story. While it got rid of my calluses initially, it seemed they grew back even thicker if I skipped a day. A regular pumice works better for me."
5,velcro heels no more,I have used a terra cotta foot scrubber for the last 5 or 6 years - love the fact that 30 seconds of scrubbing my heels in the shower each morning keeps my heels from drying and getting prickly. My original scrubber met its demise when my husband knocked it onto the tile floor - it broke. I ordered my self a new scrubber and 3 more for the daughters-in-law stockings at Christmas.
5,I really really like this,"I had one that got lost in the move, so replaced it with this one. It is still fresh and works great after 2 years. It never makes my feet feel raw, but it definitely exfoliates the dead skin. My feet look great. It stays fresh even though I leave it in the shower. I do rinse it off after each use and I do use soap when I use it."
5,A Solution That WORKS!,"Like others, I have tried and tested numerous products to soften my foot. After numerous surgeries and casts on one foot, the other foot seems extra tough!After first use, I loved it! It did take 2 or 3 times to get the best results. Now my rough foot looks like the protected, smooth foot.Initially, I didn't think it was working because I couldn't even feel it. Watch out though, it's working! It doesn't even feel rough at all. Also, I used it on my sensitive foot out of curiosity. Normally, can't use anything because it hurts but this foot scrubber seems extra gentle.I would recommend this to others looking for a good solution to soften feet.My only suggestion would be to have a big handle on it, but this lack won't keep me from using it. It seems like it will last a long time, if it ever needs replacing, I'm going to get exactly the same thing!"
1,Totally fell apart,What a waste of money. Fell apart immediately. Clay disintegrated as it was used to make an orange tub. Handle broke after 3 uses.
1,Broke on use,"Recieved product in one piece, Dang man, my feet are not that bad, broke when started scrubbing.Tried to use a piece and that broke as well. Low quality. oprah gave good reviews on this so said what theheck. You are wrong Oprah. LOL."
3,"Useful, but...","A handy book to have, but more details (like in the Code Keeper series) would be helpful."
5,Works as advertised...,"Used this wrench to adjust the hubs on one of my road bikes. Worked great! Not the most ergonomic wrench on the planet, but is definitely a quality tool."
4,Gets the job done.,"Park historically makes quality bike tools. This one is no different. It does what it is supposed to do. Excellent quality for this price. A longer handle would make life a bit easier, but all in all, an excellent purchase."
4,"Good for hubs, bad for pedals","Works good for what it's made for, which is wheel hubs, but fails as a pedal wrench. I couldn't get mine off with this wrench. I had to go buy a dedicated pedal wrench.I would give five stars, but it gets only four for not being a exact tight fit for the 15mm end."
4,Sturdy but sharp edges if you plan to use as pedal wrench,"I bought this wrench as a poor man's pedal wrench since it can multitask. It does the job, but make sure you keep some gloves handy for use when putting a lot of torque on the wrench. The edges are fairly sharp and the wrench is fairly short so places to grab it is limited. Overall, a good product from Park as usual though."
1,Index? What's that?,"On top of what others already said about this book, the index is completely useless!! It is all of almost 7 pages long, and that is with a large font, double line-spacing and a single column. I think the average letter has 10-15 references. This is WAY too little for an almost 600-page book. Books of this size usually have an index of more than 25 pages, in a smaller font, with 2 columns on a page.I don't know how Prentice Hall could ever release this."
4,Makes You Think,"Unconditional Life: Discovering the Power to Fulfill Your DreamsMy brother turned me on to this author and so far I am understanding how his mind works and why we all need to re-evaluate our thinking about our purpose on this earth. I am still reading the book, but want to tell everyone to buy this one, if for no other reason than to have a different point of view in their list of titles to read at home."
3,lights,bought it because it was a great price didn't use it for what I wanted to it is good for people in the arts for lighting
4,Entertaining,"A rollicking adventure played to the hilt by Mr Lee. The plot was a little thin and the lines were slightly predictable, but all in all, still an entertaining movie. Terrific inclusion of characters of the time... such as King Edward, Lillie Langtree, Theodore Roosevelt, and Gugliamo Marconi."
3,ENJOYABLE MOVIE - BUT...,Enjoyed the movie. The only problem I had was the the audio sinc was slightly off on part of the movie - the dialog did not match up with the actors lip movement - annoying - otherwise I would have given it 4 stars
2,"Very Little Good to Say about ""It""","I suppose the high point of the film, for me, was the rather incongruous sight of Christopher Lee, as Holmes, and Claude Akins, as Teddy Roosevelt, riding a steam railroad locomotive from a rather unusual perch.I would have preferred to see it as an outtake on YouTube.Overall, I would have to say that if the people who wrote, directed, and edited this film have any sense for pacing or dramatic tension, or any ability for the construction of mysteries, they left few clues behind."
1,Not even close,This translation of The Odyssey changes and in sometimes excludes parts of the original work. I don't recommended to anyone especially if you need it for school.
1,Product Not Received,Poor. It has been a month since I purchased this novel. My daughter needed it forHigh School asap but product has not arrived from the West Coast yet.
3,Nice CD,"This is a great CD. It has his greatest hits but also several songs that were unknown to me. Some of them I like, some of them I don't. Overall, the songs I originally purchased this for are of excellent quality."
5,The Best of the Best,I really enjoyed the essential Neil Diamond because he really shows the true legend Neil Diamond truly is. He has endured greatly over the years and his music will stand the test of time. Neil's appeal has embraced all ages and his range is such that anyone can relate to. This CD is really enojoyable and will truly bring delightful memories for your listening pleasure.
5,neil diamond cd,it is a very good cd came in new condition and i have already listened to it several times. ive donebussiness with them before and they are still as good as they were then thanks alot.
2,Disappointed,"Don't repeat my mistake: I failed to read the reviews first, and am sorry I purchased this CD. This is the best song selection of Neil Diamond I have found, and ""Remastered Original Recordings"" was exciting. But, as some of the other reviews noted, these are definitely not the ""Original Hits"". A swath of these songs are from (much) later concerts, including one song where it sounds like he had a very bad cold and was only croaking along because he had to finish the performance to get off stage. ""Call me a relic, call me what you will;"" I like the hits better and will have to buy another CD to get them."
4,Good but could have been better,"This is an excellent cd with great sound. Unfortunately, there are too many live tracks when far superior studio versions are available (Shilo, Play Me) etc. While some of live work is good (mostly on disk 2) some of it is barely listenable. For instance, on Play Me, the crowd erupts into screaming cheers after almost every line Neil sings completely breaking the song up. The studio version would have been much better. As with any ""best of"" released in the lasst 10 years, many better tracks of this artist are left off while almost unknown tracks are included. This cd is valuable for tracks 1-14 on disk 1 and most of disc 2, and its excellent sound, so thats not bad."
5,If you love Neil then....,you will love this CD! His songs are so clear on this CD. Brings back LOADS OF MEMORIES from when Mom played them and you HAD to listen but secretly loved the songs. hehehehehe I LOVE THIS GIFT!
5,C'mon guys!,"-- the album has 38 songs... 9 of them are live cuts... what's the big deal to complain about an acceptable sampling of live materials for an ""essential"" collection? (ie, only one out five songs, is a live cut)... gimme a break!... beware that this is not a ""greatest hits"" collection, if that's what you're expecting to get, there's these couple of volumes previously released as such...... read the labels before you... write!"
4,Songs sung blue.,"This collection is very similar to his 2-disc ""Greatest Hits 1966-1992"", but I think this is the better one. For the casual fan, every song is here that matters, and with 38 hits, it really is essential. Included is ""Solitary Man"", ""Sweet Caroline"", ""I Am...I Said"", and ""America"", among many others. It also has my favorite ""Heartlight"", which wasn't a huge hit, but makes me feel good. It's true some of these tracks are live, but they're still nearly as enjoyable as the originals. Live ""Neil"" is pretty good after all. If you want just 1 disc, get the 18 track ""Collection""."
3,back to the future,"I saw this album & said, wow let me add that to my cart... then, I saw that the first 9 tracks were mono... are we back to the 50's ? And you wonder how anybody could consider piracy ? I'd like to BUY a comprehensive album like this of Neil D. but mono, no thanks. ONE track MAX."
1,Give us a break,"Why do the record companies continue to put out albums, with LIVE cuts on them?? If I wanted a LIVE album, I would buy a LIVE album. I was going to purchase this CD, but changed my mind because of the LIVE cuts."
1,Poor value,"I have almost all the recordings of Neil Diamond since the early 70's and to listen to this is does a poor service to the artist's career as a performer. The audio remastering is poor, the musical arrangements are even worse. Even though this is supposed to be live, make no mistake this is no ""Live at the Greek"" or ""Hot August Night"" this sounds more like elevator music. If you are an enthusiast of Neil Diamond's music and passionate performance don't dissapoint yourself with this recording."
1,"sad, sad, sad","I can't believe an Essential CD would contain live material from the 90's when Neil's voice became horse and unpleasant. Don't waste your money on this one. I highly recommend The Very Best Of Neil Diamond and In My Lifetime 3 CD set. These collections contain absolutely no dubious live recordings. Neil's live material from the 60's and 70's, in my opinion, are way better than the 80's, 90's, and 2000's. Neil sounds better in the studio nowadays than hearing him live as his singing on stage now is more sloppy and off key."
2,Good and bad,"Half of the songs are good originals. The other half are some concert recordings that suck, where Neil talks the lyrics instead of singing them."
2,The essential collection of bad music,"I wish I had paid more attention to the previous reviews. They are very accurate. This collection of songs lacks quality and makes you wonder if you really are listening to Neil Diamond at time. The old adage is true, you get what you pay for. Whoever produces these so called ""Essential"" albums finds the cast offs that would never make the cut on the original album release market. Save you money, buy one of the original albums!!!"
4,Is it Neil,My husband loves Neil Diamond and says this is a good collection.He is wondering however if there is a stand-in voice on disc 1. Ontime and a fun collection however.
4,Neil Diamond Essentials,The music is great about all you need.As usual Amazon delivered a good value for the price
3,Too many live cuts!,Probably the best collection of his music. Why do we have to settle for cuts that were not what we heard on the radio? Who makes these crapola decisions? Pefect set if not for someone's idea of what we should hear.GLK
2,Could have been so much better,"What a shame that gems such as Longfellow Serenade, Signs, Lady-Oh and Both Sides Now were left off this release in exchange for several low quality live recordings that DO appear.Given Mr. Diamond's long and illustrious career, this release disappoints. Again, what a shame. So much potential and so little fulfillment."
4,"It's the newer ""Live"" ones that make this set unique!","There are at least four Neil Diamond's represented on this collection -- from the (1) very early ""Bang"" pieces (Cherry Cherry, You Got to Me) to the (2) classic studio hits (Sweet Caroline, I Am...I Said) to (3) mid-career MOR pop songs (You Don't Bring Me Flowers, Forever in Blue Jeans) to (4) newly recorded ""live"" versions of often-overlooked, but quite substantial, ND compositions (Soolaimon, Captain Sunshine, Yes I Will/Lady Magdalene).It's the later group (found only on this CD) which makes it especially worthwhile, because in recording them here ND has (finally) learned to sing into the microphone, instead of shouting over it to the last row of the arena. Much better engineering than on previous ""live"" collections, excepting the full-throttle (original) Hot August Night, and 1997's hard-to-find ""ND Live in Concert"" 3-CD collection, whose Missa/Soolaimon and re-mastered Jonathon Livingston Seagull suites are not to be matched. Enjoy!"
3,"Looks decent, sandpaper-like rough surface","These doormats are really rugged despite its tropical appearance. They have survived through rainstorms, ice storms and all the road salt in the past year. Though it seems to absorb moisture really well, it seems to remain damp longer than other doormats that I have.I've used these exclusively outdoors now since they can withstand the weather - just not an ideal item for indoor."
2,retired,I just received my first edition yesterday. I think it did have some good infromation. I thought I was getting a magazine not a news letter other wise it was OK.
1,Awesome poems - Awful Edition,Apparently the best way to honor the 50th anniversary release of a Pulitzer prize winning poet's book is to publish it so freakishly small that people can barely read it.I guess they forgot that some of the people who read this poetry when it was first released in the early sixties are now in their late sixties and were not gifted with bionic vision...
3,Getting comfortable with the complexity of Live Wire,"Chris Beard is a Stratocaster blues player in the power-bandleader vein of Luther & Bernard Allison. With his third release and first self-produced album, Beard gives a nod to Luther with his own ""Live Wire"" record captured over two dates in Grand Rapids, MI and Chicago IL. At 22, he is already competent in the funk/rock power style that varies from the traditional 12-bar format, using extensive soloing and one-string electric leads that originated with players like Albert & B.B. King. Beard is more confident speaking through is guitar on this record than singing, as his tenor voice seems held back over the horn section. Regardless, his understanding of the melding genres shows promise and adaptability with an unaltered impression of our last generation's material. Previously nominated for a W.C. Handy award, he is a rising roadhouse soul who will bring the blues legacy to the next generation. - Brett Lemke - www.maximuink.com"
4,"Good socioeconomics, but dated","City on the Edge is one of the finest books written on the socioeconomic dynamics of Miami and Dade County. The overall history of the city is only lightly treated (and unfortunately, there are few works on the history of South Florida) as the book instead focuses mostly on developments in Miami's recent history, namely from the 1960's forward, as it began its Anglo to Latino ""transformation."" Be warned, however, that the book is somewhat dated (published in '93 originally, hence 4 stars instead of 5); Miami is a booming, complicated, rapidly evolving city and has changed fairly significantly since then, but the underlying city culture (and it's quirky, problematic socioeconomics) are still there, as analysed by this book. The analysis and overview of the various black groups in Miami in the book was also very revealing."
3,Miami shuffle....,"This book shows much relevance up until the early 1990s but it also suffers from being dated because Miami is a city in constant shuffle. Change doesn't occur but shuffling of priorities and communities in Miami because the individuals running City and State politics have always been invested in maintaining a similar status quo. White flight occurred in the early 1980s with Miami rebellions of 80, 82 and 89 but the violence of gentrification is missing from any chapters in this book because this phenomenon has been taking place within the last 10 years. It's important to read or re-read Black Miami in the Twentieth Century by local Miami historian Marvin Dunn. There have also been a mass migration of Brazilian, Peruvian, Central American people whose impact on the economy like the Haitian and African-American community has been over looked by major City and State politicians."
3,Not the Greatest Movies,"These were not the best movies I ever saw by any means of the word. The plot moved slow, the language was very bad in a couple of them, one them contained nudity, the description should have much more descriptive had these details been included I would never had purchased the movies with all the cursing or nudity. I have definitely seen better movies with Sam Elliott he is one of my favorite actors."
2,Sam Elliot Western Collection,These movies are fine for the person who likes allot of shooting and action . Sam Elliot is a cowboys cowboy . He's tough .
3,Not the best of Sam Elliot,"If you want to see Sam Elliot at his best, go for The Sacketts.I was quite dissapointed after watching his Wester Collection."
2,Not up to Sam's standards,"Of all of Sam Elliot's films this is probably the driest, most mundane he's done. It is not in his tradition in that it is somewhat sad and almost depressing. Not at all up to his standards."
5,Sam Elliott collection,Sam is such a fantastic actor there is no other like him out there today. Really enjoyed the set I bought and am saving for the next lot. Again Amazon service perfect and delivery really quick.
3,Okay but not great.,"Sam Elliot is the last great cowboy actor, but these are not his best films. He's as great as ever but the material is lacking and doesn't rise to meet his talent."
5,Sam Elliot Western Collection,"Sam Elliot is another favorite of mine. Not only in westerns, but in other action movies as well. This collection is a good one and the Rough Riders is actually a two DVD movie, part one and two. Good Sam Elliot movies!"
5,Can't go wrong with Hornady,"Great quality at a great price. These dies work great, and have a really nice case to hold them as well."
1,Very Unhappy w/ This Hard to Use Gate!,"It's not something you can put up in a ""pinch"" so forget trying to install it w/ your toddler around. Have to adjust the length then ""fine tune"" it for a tighter fit on all 4 corners.I bought this for my 3rd child so it's not like I'm ""new"" at this game. I'm returning it ... and I can't even get it to fold all the way down like it's suppose to!:o("
1,AWEFUL,"This gate is just aweful! It's hard to adjust and set up. Like another review mentioned, you can't even fold it back like it should, so you can put it back in the case. Unfortunetly, it was a baby shower gift and my son just started crawling and I just got it out and my husband threw out the box. Don't bother and get yourself something better!"
1,what is it,"having been out of the 'baby stage' for some time, a description like 'gateway to go' with no picture available leaves me completely in the dark. Have pity and if no picture is available, write a better description to go with an item"
5,Not just for toddlers!,"I recently visited Chicago and had time to visit their art museum. When I came home, my daughter was entranced with the pictures I had taken and the fact that I stood in front of famous paintings, like ""American Gothic"" and ""Sunday in the Park"".She's turning 9 and I'm buying this book as a birthday gift for her. Most art books are limited to a single art style or artist and I wanted a broader range collected in one book. It's great to show the books to toddlers, but don't forget older children who are starting to develop a true interest in things outside their own little world."
4,Great keepsake book,"This book is wonderful gift for children ages 2 and up. Age 2 children (like my son) will enjoy counting the apples on the A page, for example. Some of the art includes complex scenes that school-age children may enjoy losing themselves in. The book helps teach children about art and the alphabet in an intelligent, non-cutesy fashion. Each letter has a two-page layout: one page is: ""[Letter] is for [one word]"" in large type, and the second page is four different artistic intrepretations of that word, like: an Egyptian mural, a Japanese woodblock print, a Renaissance canvas, and nineteenth century French painting. What a refreshing change from cartoonish, character-based children's books!"
5,beautiful,"I highly recommend this book. It is beautiful, it works on letters and word recognition and hopefully helps grow an appreciation for art and it's different forms. Not only does my son have it, it is now the baby gift that I give to all new parents. Love it."
2,"Eh..well, its cheap","Well, you get what you pay for. This yoga bag really does serve its purpose by holding my yoga mat but now what do I do with my keys, wallet, water bottle, etc. For the price it is really not that bad but after buying this I got myself a bag on oGorgeous' website and that is the bag I would much more recommend if you are willing to spend some money on the bag. There website is [...] and I am able to fit the mat without struggling as well as everything else I want AND my new bag is so cute!"
3,"BARELY fits 1/4""yoga mat; not much else.","This is a bag for yoga mats; that's all. You're not going to fit your yoga blocks or towels or water in this bag if you've got a 1/4"" yoga mat. I have to physically struggle with the bag to actually fit the mat in the bag, but when it's in, it's in. I've added a picture as to what this looks like.Other than that, the common complaints are the same: its strap is too short, the material is cheapy feeling, and again, it's a little too tight.But you're looking at this bag precisely because it is cheap and it can hold a mat. If that's all you need the bag to do, then grab this for the 6$."
2,nice but cheap,"Serves its purpose well, although the bag is almost a little too short and narrow for the mat. You have to roll it up tightly and evenly to get it to fit, a little disappointed in the quality of it as well, cheap, thin material and netting, not really worth $9.00."
4,suitable & fits 1/4,"I bought this with the 1/4"" mat also from [...] They suggest that you get the bigger bag for the 1/4"" mat but it's totally not necessary. Unless you have problems rolling your mat up this bag is a roomy fit for the 1/4"" mat from yoga accessories."
3,yoga bag,This has some unique features but is built too small for my mat. Rolling it up super tightly to fit gets old.
2,NetObjects Fusion 11,"Originally purchased NOF 10, but the company didn't have that one. So they sent NOF 11. I upgraded from NOF 8 to NOF 11. I wanted NOF 10 because it has less problems than NOF 11. Ever since I upgraded I have had nothing but problems with this program. My site uploads great in IE, but not in Firefox. Half of my pages in Firefox won't even show up. I also can't get my Navigation Buttons to work like I want them. Some of my pages will center & some won't. I am truly unhappy with this purchase."
5,Accomplishes Its Goal - Well Done,This book will give you the historical background necessary to discover a mature conceptual overview of Satan in the Bible. This book is balanced and its conceptual information is rational and well researched.I would highly recommend this book to anyone - Christian or non-Christian. It is not a long book to read and it is not a difficult or highly theological read. It is objective and would be a great starter book for those who are wondering what the Bible really does have to say about Satan.
5,Powerful and Moving,"This book starts out good and then just gets better and better with each new Pilgrimage. Wright takes the reader on a journey with such descriptive writing that one wonders if his degree is in literature, instead of theology and history. Wright deals with the idea of Pilgimage on the road to Damascus, at the Jordan, in the Wilderness, in Galilee where most of Jesus minsitry took place, in Jerusalem, on the mountain where God is experienced in transfigurative ways, Gethsemene, where the agony of purpose takes place, the Cross (the best chapter), the empty tomb and then reflections on current day Israel. This book will take you away and cause you to feel like you were on the mountain, at the Jordan and was a witness of the cross. Wright's reflections are insightful, powerful and moving. Get this book."
5,A book for all women interested in staying healthy,"Innovative and delicious recipes, informative text. I like the fact that I can enjoy olive oil and canola oil without ingesting harmful fats. The author is obviously no stranger to the subject of nutrition. I have bought several copies as gifts for friends I truly care about.Truly a super book!"
3,"Full of useful information, but predictable recipes","Useful information on food sources for vital nutrients, but fairly predictable dependance on Italian and Mediterranean cooking styles and disappointing recipes. Some of us actually like our vegetables cooked until tender, rather than that half-raw, heated-through, but still crunchy texture that gives us gas. And I am tired of using olive oil on every thing"
2,Wasn't what I was looking for...,This set does contain sight words that children grades prek-1st grade should know. However for those who would like to use the Dolch Sight Words then this set of cards fall short in quite a few of words from the Dolch list. I ended up making my own set of sight words (following the Dolch method) using index cards.
3,1988 us open video is better,i was dissapointed with this cbs video because it doesnt feature the voices of pat summerall and tony trabbert like the 88 us open video does.also it only shows match point from the 2 mens semifinals and there was a 2nd round matchup between becker and rostagno and a critical match point against becker which he managed to win barely with the ball clipping over the net and this video doesnt even show that pivotal point that would have won the match for rostagno.this is unforgivable by cbs in my opinion.they could have shown more tennis highlights instead of wasting time on showing the grounds of the tennis stadium and spending time on dumb things like how a guy could sneak in to see a match for free by getting dressed up as a waiter and sneaking in the back.
5,great book!!!!,"I ordered this for a friend and had a chance to preview it. It is a wonderful book that explains a wide variety of ways to paint fabric, including projects and examples. I'm back to order myself a copy."
2,OK but not great reference,Perhaps I expected too much but I felt that this book barely covered most symptoms. There was very little discussion regarding different illnesses. Sometimes my child's symptoms met more than one criteria and then I was too often left wondering. I think that at times this book was actually more confusing than helpful.
2,Not very good,"This book has a little tiny bit of information, sometimes just a description, about a lot of things. I don't ever use it because it just doesn't help out that much when your child is sick and you need clear information."
5,Fantastic Baby Shower gift! Wonderful book,"A great all-around, general reference for babycare & childcare. Excellent baby shower gift - most pregnant women get too many baby clothes, stuffed animals, blankets and other useless gifts, but what parents need is good, sensible child care books. This is a good start for parents to have, and they can add specialty books about co-sleeping, or sleep-training, or discipline, and use the this AAP book to compare different solutions to parenting challenges."
3,Not what I expected to receive from my pediatrician!,"This book is poorly organized and lacking form and good information. It seems to refer to older children rather than babies and the ""if"" approach to your babies symptoms is lousy... It always leaves you in the dark. I would not recommend this book for a first time parent."
2,So-So,"I wouldn't recommend this book. it is hard to follow, it doesn't satisfy the answers to your question and I've already found 2 illnesses that aren't in this book that my kids have recently had."
4,ANSWERS FOR ANXIOUS PARENTS,"Why does my newborn baby scream every night? Why won't my baby sleep in her crib? Why does she spit up at every feeding? Breast or bottle - which is best?When a parent needs an answer, often it is when no one is available to answer. The middle of the night is no time to ponder whether or not your baby has an ear infection. Use this handbook as a resource for help and comfort as you try to navigate the complex channels of parenthood. The book provides timely advice and information on the most common baby questions, including great info on what to expect and how-to's for new parents, grandparents and caregivers. Keep a copy in the nursery, you'll reach for it often.Your baby did not come with a set of instructions -- this handbook is the next best thing."
5,Very helpful in a pinch,This is the first place I go when I have a question about my 5-month-old's health. So often I haven't been sure if it is something serious or something normal and this book has helped me decide. The format really helped to clear things up. I wish some of the sections (rashes especially) would have little pictures to help you determine if it applied for you or not. It also helps me to know the critical issues so when I do talk to the pediatrician I can describe the symptoms a little better.
1,Confussing,When looking at this book it was hard to find the symptoms and the solutions in the book. It was not what I was looking for.
2,Too Thin,"Very light, thin gold. Mine arrived broken but Amazon makes it simple to return. I shop with them all the time. Not impressed with this necklace at all for the price."
2,"scattered, incomplete",I realize this is not intended to be a factory manual or a step-by-step guide but what I have found is that more often than not the information I am looking for is not in this book. Maybe you will get lucky and there is an article for a particular job in this book but it cannot serve as your primary resource. I have also found that if you can dig info out of this book it would have been faster and easier to use google.
3,A well written book for the non nclear engineer,As a professor of nuclear engineering at the 1st. research reactor at the ARE Atomic energy Authority (ARE-ETRR-1) I have read the book and made some technical presentations to non nuclear engineers and proffessionals. I found the response of the audiance very encouraging to go into more details of this complicated subject. I am thinking of translating the book to the arabic language to be more useful to a wider scope of audiance. I like to know if there is amore recent publication later than 1973. I ejoyed readsing this book and congratulate Mr. Inglis for his effort.
2,Busfanatic,"Nice photos, text doesn't go very deep into VW history or technical stuff. It's a good intro in the world of VW transporters (splitscreens/ baywindows/wedges). But if you want the real stuff: buy the book Original VW Bus by Laurence Meredith"
2,Too Superficial,"I purchased this book as an introduction to Copper Canyon for a hiking trip just entering the planning stages. The book is a thin (think: Time Magazine), soft cover compilation of one to two page articles about Copper Canyon. It is the sort of thing you would buy as a souvenir from a tourist stand and it is written at the middle-school level. That said, even though I was disappointed, the book was a satisfactory orientation to the information I now know I need to go out and find. The Railroad Log, which describes notable sights along the famous Chihuahua al Pacifico railroad, will be useful as will the list of plants and birds in the back (I will just make photocopies and take them along)."
2,2010 Tour,"This booklet give a simple outline of Copper Canyon suitable for travelers interested in a ""quick look"" of the region. However, the lack of maps for orientation and rather poor illustrationsare significant shortcomings.Those interested in more details of Copper Canyons would be disappointed with this publication."
1,Not worth the money,This is definately not worth the money. It is a series of one to two page articles on a few topics with relevance to the copper canyon area.Do yourself a favor and spend an hour with google. You'll know more in the end.
4,"I do like ""You Won't Find Another""....","I'll have to disagree with Gassy Goon ....I do like ""You Won't Find Another Fool Like Me"". I love Lyn Paul on lead vocal and wish they would have used her more. Even though the song did not chart in this country (but #1 in England) it did get airplay. I thought Lyn sounded so great when she'd ""crack"" her voice as if she were singing during the roaring 20's. It was, and still is, Feel Good pop. However, note the New Seekers only had a couple big hits in this country .. ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing"" (#7) and ""Look What They've Done to My Song, Ma"" (#4). After those two, some listeners may not recognize many more.By the way..... Lyn is still gorgeous!"
2,well not everything....not even close......,"i purchased this book and was disappointed with the book,the author had the heroine who was the private investigator so sloppy and clueless and the whirlwind relationship was whack.then let me say i've never read where a hero cried as much as ben did in this story, and he was a CEO.... the only interested part was when deanne was kidnapped and ben's ex was not taking no; no matter how it was said but to be honest i didn't read where it was written that she was told no in plain english,maybe that was the problem....naaaa..the book just wasnt what i thought it to be. i wasted my money on this one."
2,okay read,it was okay..the headliners of this story was very naive..the woman in this story was really stupid..but once u get past that i guess it is ok..i just don't like reading stories about women who have their lives together..but can't see when someone is using them..her cousin really got on my nerves.and the way she always forgave her was stupid..didn't not enjoy this book..which was really disappointing because i really loved my angel..don't give up on this writer..
4,Very enjoyable read!,I really enjoyed this book! The characters were very believable and the plot twisted in the most romantic way! I looking forward to more books written by Mrs.Skelton!
1,Hated it!!!,"Can I have my hours back? Ugh....finished it, but why? A small twist gave it some interest for like 15 min, but the general reading experience was blah and anger over her stupidity about her cousin... Mann, I'm mad at myself about this..."
4,Good Read,The book is nicely written minus the typos. You really can't say much about its meaning because it's a romance novel...it does just what you want it to do...make you desire the need of being in love.
2,"Should be titled, My Not Quite Everything","It started out ok. Deanna (Dee) is an investigator hired by Ben to find a long lost relative. You can feel the attraction between them but somewhere - and I'm not quite sure where - I really begin to get tired of Dee. Ms Skelton turned her from this intuitive female PI to this nieve can't see passed her nose girl. I think Ms Skelton meant for Dee's relationship with her cousin Terry to look as if Dee were this caring, always there for her cousin, be the bigger person kind of feel but instead it made her look more like a door mat.At first I could feel the attraction between Ben and Dee (especially the little gifts and things they'd do for one another) and I liked that Ben wasn't afraid to cry in situations where crying would be the norm but I always felt he loved her more than she loved him.Overall, there were some good parts but it just didn't work for me."
3,Beware Spoilers Below!!!,"Especially the review by ""Barbara Bab"". I'm so mad that she actually gave away the ending!!! How mean is that!!"
2,two extra seasons for nothing,"I am just going to add that this is a pointless season, if you want to get depressed and see how everyone dies, buy it otherwise spare your time and money."
5,Everyone is Waiting!,"This show will stay with you for a long time. The characters are quirky and likable. ""Breathe me"" by Sia will become a favorite. And the... slight spoiler here.... end - Nate telling Claire "" You can't take a picture"" it already happened will definetly find you wiping tears away! And gosh could the guys be any sexier? And good for her for being the one to go."
4,"Lovely series, but...","..apparently HBO is releasing a REAL complete series set for just 280 bucks, that includes a new booklet (Obituaries), a family tree, and the 2 soundtracks that were released. It's coming out October 31! I for one am slighlty dissapointed that these individual seasons are so pricey (hence the four star rating) and yet this new set is truly a deal, with each set pricing under 60 bucks apiece."
3,Six Feet Under-The Complete Fifth Season,The complete Fifth Season consisted of five discs. The first disc had scratches which prevented me from veiwing the end of the first and third episodes. I chose to view the remaining four discs which I am happy to report had no defects. I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning the entire set when only one disc was damaged.
5,Highlight of my life,"I hadn't really thought of 6FU before a year ago but a friend recently let me borrow season 1. After the first episode I was hooked. The only reason I didn't watch all 5 seasons immediately is because I wanted to savor it. I have hit a mild depression watching the final episode. I am not one to cry but the last episode entitled ""Everyone is Waiting"", I cried my heart out. I think many people feel the same way. I had heard someone mention that it was incredible and I wouldn't expect it, and I really didn't. Please watch the full season. Gosh, writing this makes me sad. Really an amazing show and ultimately changed my view on life. I really believed in these people and I actually rarely thought they were acting. Give it a chance."
3,Disappointed,"Six Feet Under started out as one of the best TV shows around. 3D characters with complex emotional issues that drew you in because they were so believable.By the time this season has come around, the characters have become 2D sterotypes. The reaction to Nate's death by his family was SO out of synch with season 1 or 2 that I felt I was watching a different show. It's good writing, but not great - and that is the difference between the first season and the last.I don't know if I even enjoyed season 5...oh well, I am glad they ended it now."
2,Six Feet Under Final Season,"The Final season started out slow. The last episode had a very creative ending. Two of the discs didn't work smoothly. I will not watch it again, but I expected I would when I bought it"
4,The conclusion,"The defenitely last season of six feet under starts with a real blow, the death of Nate. His death is like a shadow over the whole season. Unlike the other seasons, the death of people is no longer so much important and part of the story. The action concentrates on the Fischer and Diaz family and how they continue in their lifes after Nate's death. Some very sad moments occur, but the end is promising when Claire starts her knew life apart from the family. You will enjoy the last season as you have enjoyed watching seasons 1-4"
2,They have severed their moorings!,"At the 13th minute of the 5th episode the word ""fun"" was finally muttered (as David was bouncing on a trampoline). I think the other f-word outnumbers ""fun"" by a factor of 100 to 1 on this show. These stories present a conception of modern American life that must be foreign to most people. The elements of human life (work, love, creation) that promise happiness and fulfillment are absent in these characters' existence. Their lives are shallow, aimless and empty as a result. I'm not sure that the series creators intended this syllogism, as it confirms the importance of traditional values."
1,Terrible,"By far the most convoluted and poorly formatted textbook I have ever had to use. Important concepts were not explained, and weird formatting of formulas (with no explanation) made it a challenge just to figure out what was written. Very little of the actual math was shown, and that which was did not clarify many issues.To put sprinkles on the mud pie it cost $125 and wasn't even bound. I mean seriously, if I'm going to pay that much money for such a crappy textbook I at least shouldn't have to worry about losing pages because it's NOT BOUND.What has the publishing industry come to?"
2,Good enough for a light snack,"This are skinny little chew sticks. Since I have a big dog who's an aggressive chewer, they don't last very long, but she likes them. Of course, this is a creature who will eat cat poop so she doesn't exactly have a discriminating palate."
3,"Okay at $1.75, not at $6-$8","I bought 8 of these when they were $1.75 and on sale for 4 for the price of 3. I would buy Dingo Dental Munchy Stix 10-Sticks, 3.1-Ounce again at that price because my dogs do like them. However, the price since went up to $7.70, then to $6.24 for a single package. They should sell several packages at that price. NOT WORTH anything close to that price, especially when you can buy them in the store for $1.52.Also, they don't freshen either of my dogs' breath much at all (even after going through about 10 packages of them), so they're just like a regular treat in that respect. For breath freshening (but not teeth cleaning) Chocolick Mints work well (not real chocolate, but you are giving your dog the taste for chocolate, not really a good thing, either)."
2,Chicken breath,I bought these for my pug to try to help his breath in between groomings. He doesn't like the sticks the way I thought he would. He pretty much will only chew on these when he is bored.
5,Pup loves them!,"My chihuahua/toy poodle mix loves these. They seem to be more appetizing and work better to clean her teeth/breath than greenies.She doesn't get one every day because I'm trying to not spoil her too much, but she sure wishes she got them daily.I can't beat the price amazon charges: it comes out to $0.17 each w/ free shipping, plus it is currently on the 4-for-3 offer so they come out to $0.13 each!"
1,Sugar,"Yet another ""dental"" treat with sugar. 4th ingredient... Rawhide, Chicken, Water, Corn Sugar. Surely can't be good for a dog's teeth."
2,"Lovely fabric, but sizing problems make it nearly useless","Even before washing (and shrinking!), this sheet is way too tight for a standard Stokke mattress. It is made of lovely fabric, but the sizing problem is really a shame because it renders the sheet nearly useless. The sheet arrives a bit too small for the standard mattress. Then, after washing, it shrinks even further. It can be used, but it takes two people to stretch it over the mattress carefully. Very frustrating, especially for the price!This is especially irritating as the special oval Stokke crib (which we LOVE) doesn't have very many options for bedding. We ended up buying high quality king size flat sheets and using the fabric to sew fitted sheets for the crib."
2,Not the comfiest,It's the most basic sheet you can buy for the Oval Mattress of the Stokke Sleepi. I'd recommend hunting down some of the other sheets out there on other websites (Sheetworld?) that are flannel or gingham. This sheet felt 2 steps away form sandpaper.
1,Not a fitted sheet,I am disappointed in this product. I had been looking for a replacement waterproof FITTED sheet and I just assumed that was what I was ordering considering the price. This is just a oval piece of material that isn't even as big as the mattress so there are about 1-2 inches around the mattress that can still aren't covered.
3,Well made but shrink quickly,I love the Stokke Sleepi Cot but find the bedding expensive and shrinks. This pulls the mattress in away from the rails which creates a hazard for babies. There are stylish and inexpensive sheets on [...] I prefer these to modernize the nursery.
5,Inspiration for everyday life,"This is a lovely book with all kinds of inspirational pieces - short, long, amazing, calming stories of faith through the power of the rosary. I felt good reading it. I gave one to a number of people as gifts, & all liked it very much. You can read one little story for a quick ""upper"" - or settle in for longer reading. It's GREAT!!!!!!!!"
5,Inspirational and motivating,"I read Sr. Pat's book as soon as I got it, and even before I finished it, a friend called and asked me some questions about the Rosary. Her book held just the answers I needed. The stories are very motivating to pray the rosary daily. Some people think the rosary is a ""chore"" or even a ""bore"" but reading this book made me realize that the rosary is one of the most powerful prayers we have. The mysteries are right out of the Bible-the story of Jesus's birth, life, death and resurrection, and of course all include his mother, Mary-our most powerful intercessor."
5,Very inspiring.,"I loved this book. Besides illustrating the power of the rosary, it shows examples of true faith, devotion and piety in everyday people, and God's wondrous presence in our lives. May the Lord bless the author and everyone who contributed their stories."
4,It does Inspire!,"I found Sis. Patricia's book to be heartfelt and inspiring. I enjoy the meat and needless to say, it was full of it. Unlike many similar books, Sister introduced the book and it's purpose then got right to allowing people to tell THEIR stories. I also appreciate the instructions and references that she included. I have purchased the book as a gift as well."
5,Stupendous book,"This book is about the best testimony about the Holy Rosary I've read. The best part is, the stories are all true! I can attest to the one about my brother entitled, ""The Blessed Mother in Kuwait"". Our Lady is always taking care of us, like a good mother should. Once you start reading, it's hard to put down. The stories are just long enough and some really give you goosebumps. It's a great book for anyone, not just Catholics. May God bless you all. :)"
5,Wonderful inspiration,I loved the book the minute I started reading it. It has shown me that ordinary people have miracles happen to them. I enjoyed it so much that I bought several copies as gifts for friends. Easy to read and enjoy just about anywhere. It is wonderful even if you only have snippets of time. I suggest it for everyone.
4,101 Inspirational Stories of the Rosary,"This book is simply awesome! Each story is a testimony to the power of prayer. The stories about the effects of praying the rosary are incredible; the kinds of stories that give you goosebumps. Whether you already pray the rosary daily or only occasionally, the stories Sr. Patricia has collected will inspire you. These stories are touching and telling; they gave me a sense of awe and hope. If you've ever doubted the power of prayer, you'll be convinced of its efficacy by the end of this book. 101 Inspirational Stories of the Rosary will make you a believer and a pray-er."
1,Silence would be preferable,"A PC primer disguised as fiction. I'm all for left-wing politics and social responsibility, but not when it's couched in bland prose and communicated by dull and mildly annoying characters."
2,just ok,"I agree with the other reviews that you have to go over your neck many times, and it still doesn't get everything. In all fairness I have never used an electric that can shave my neck well, but this one is really bad. It also caused irritation due to the many times I had to go over areas."
2,Thought it was ok until foil failed.,"It actually shaved the chin-cheek area efficiently after going over a few times..but then after four days the foil tore a bit and needless to say, you don't want to attempt to shave then or yep,definetly feral cats ravage your face! Has a tough time shaving the neck area like one of the previous reviewers stated as well. I actually ordered the Remington duel foil/cutters-titanium travel shaver"" recently and its a much better product than this. I recommend giving the remington titanium travel shaver a try instead. Works great."
1,Nice as a prop or paperweight.,"My girlfriend bought this for me, knowing the suspiciously low price might mean that it barely worked... but considering the testimonials on TV, gave it a shot.Big mistake. Maybe good for pre-pubescent kids wanting to shave off peach fuzz. For me, it did nothing to even a 5 o'clock shadow.On the bright side, the free travel kit was worth the price of the razor (unsure if this is available through Amazon)... but the tweezers that come with it do a better job than the featured product.(side note: I'm convinced that the reviewers who gave it more than three stars are all plants)"
1,Worked for 30 seconds,"After seeing this nice little shaver on TV, I decided to purchase it from Amazon.com. It proceeded to shave about as well as I'd expect (not close as a razor but nice enough) until it died about 30 seconds after I started it. It came with a pair of generic AA batteries, so I figured they were at fault. I replaced them with a new pair of name brand batteries, and the razor was still dead. I got about one half of a shave out of this product. Terrible."
1,Not thrilled at all,"Seeing this product on the infomercials, I found it very appealing. Wondering in to my local Walgreens, which sells as seen on TV products, I purchased it for around $10.65.I am so glad I purchased it there with a giftcard my employer gave me! I figured because of the price it was probably cheap and wouldn't work well or break easy! I was wrong! IT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL!This is a shotty product, and misleading advertising."
4,could be better,"I have had two. The first one lasted three weeks and the second lasted six weeks. They are both great shavers, better than my Norelco three blade(circular)except, they seem to break easy at the latch that holds the blade cover down. If this can be fixed, no other shaver is necessary!"
1,Complete Junk,"This razor is complete hype, it refuses to shave anything on your neck and leaves you feeling like you just dry shaved with a dull pocket knife."
1,Don't waste your money,It generates too loud noise for anyone to stand it. I have decide to return it although I will lose some money.
1,Titanium Turbo Tanks,"I tried the Titanium Turbo--it was the single worst shaving experience of my life.Not only did the shaver shave only some of the whiskers, it shaved them to randomly different lengths. There was not one part of my face or neck that really got a close shave.The T2 did do one thing very well. It irritated the heck out of my skin, not only on the neck, but even up on my face.If you get a chance to use this product...DON'T."
2,died fast,"I bought these because I thought they would be cool for Halloween. I think that they maybe were used 5 times and they both died. I did have the orange one outside and they are recommended for indoor use, but the black was inside and didn't last very long. I would recommend them if you were only going to use them once or twice, they did look cool when they worked."
3,"Half Good, Half Not","I jumped on this pair of lamps when they were a very special price. I can't tell you how pleased I was with the orange lamp (even after one friend thought it looked red - which wouldn't be cool.)The black one, however, simply looks blue or violet - like a old fashioned ""black light"" does - so it didn't work so well for the halloween theme. Two orange lamps in the set would be better."
2,Black light burned out in less than 36 hours.,A few days ago we installed these bulbs on our front porch for a Halloween display. 3 nights later the black bulb is dead. A disappointment considering they are now our of stock.
2,Not what I expected,I was really looking forward to getting this book but sadly I was very disappointed when I read through it. This isn't exactly what I would consider Gnostic. The author has used Gnostic thinking to basically create his own tradition. Most of it is harder to swallow than the writings of Jesus that we do have. I retured my copy.
2,Yawn........,"This is one of two books I bought from this offer. Unfortunately, his writing style does very little for me and I found very few significant insights to give it any praise. I do have to admit that I could not finish the book. it was just too drab for me. (Personal opinion)."
5,"Excellent!! Sammamish ,WA","This is a wonderful book!! Very well rounded overveiw of Christian Gnostic principles. Very helpful insights on how to apply Gnostic Living in every day life. Highly recommend it!! Extremely useful meditations, Highly recommend all of Tau Malachi's books. They seem to all compliment one another. Must have for any library. Thank goodness for such work!"
4,Not bad,"I used this book for a 2 semester course in E&M. I absolutely hated it for the first semester, but it's merits became apparent during the second semester. The treatment of statics is inadequate at best, but Pollack and Stump do a great job from the chapter on Maxwell's equations on. The chapter on relativity and tensors alone makes this book a worthwhile buy. I would suggest using Griffith's for statics and Pollack and Stump for dynamics, but given the cost of both books thats probably going to be an expensive proposition."
1,Dead On Arrival,"I opened the box and put the thermometer on my dresser. After about 3 hours it displayed 15 degrees below room temperature. There were no instructions suggesting this was normal, so I returned it to Amazon. Also, they say it's ""antiqued"", but the one I received just looked cheap and sloppy."
3,"Good Concept, Bad Delivery","Captioning is a great way to teach children how to read. Unfortunetly, the captioning in this video is small and hard to read. Also, the words change sizes as they are being read. You would think this would make it easier to follow along but it doesn't - it just confuses things.On the good side of things these are great stories, the characters are familiar to many children and the music videos are fun. The other languages are a bonus too.Read-TV is a much better way to teach children to read through captions. The text is big and kid-friendly, the stories are sweet and the production values are great."
2,Conspiracy theory,There were facts that made me think about it.It appeared to be biased against our President.I hope that this information is not correct
2,Some good info - but the producers are totally anti-semetic,"Okay, I love ALL the Alex Jones films, but the people that made this seem anti-semitic. LET ME BE CLEAR it is not anti-semitic to point out that the Rothschild's have incredible control of world affairs and if they didn't want Obama as president he wouldn't be. HOWEVER in this film they seem to use the fact that people are jewish as empirical evidence that they are evil. I would watch this on YouTube and not buy it since there is useful information in here but I wouldn't give them my money. ALSO THEY QUOTE FROM THE PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION WHICH IS MIDDLE AGES PROPAGANDA!!!"
1,Absolutely pathetic,"I was expecting some data and some serious thoughts. But all I found is and complete idiot saying totally random things, with an irritating self-made profecy tone. His racism and stupid ideas will lead even stupider people to believe in him, which is unbelievable.Obama is a communist? Being a homossexual makes you the devil? Texe Marrs you are probably the stupidest person I have ever seen. Go waste your time on something else!"
1,How to become antisemitic,"This report presents Jewish people as criminals just for the fact of being Jews through demagogy; it's arguments are poor and lacks of reliable information, blames a whole nation (Jewish nation) for the crimes committed by a small group, the Rothschild."
1,"Amazon should not be promoting ""hate"" stuff like this","If you hate jews, homosexuals, if you believe in the Illuminati controling the world and other conspiration theories, then you may be want to spend 25$ to buy this ""hate"" DVD."
3,excellant change the the same overplayed elves.,"The way they changed an almost over played godd creature like the elves, into a cruel and hateful society is refreshing and new. The authors are not eddings or R. Jordan, but the books are still an enjoyable read."
2,Fizzled out in the end.,"I thought this book would be a winner but instead I became vaguely dissatisfied with it. When I read the beginning (about Serina and the lives of the human slaves and the elflords as well as the dragons) I couldn't put the book down. However somewhere towards the middle or the end... something went wrong. The plot got dull and uninteresting and moreover, the ending was so quick and abrupt that it didn't fulfill the promise it had shown in the richly detailed and thrilling beginning."
3,Entertaining reading...,"It has a few rough spots, but it's good stuff: an interesting view on fantasy elements with a strong heroine and plot twists. One usually doesn't see elves as selfish and cruel, or dragons as (for the most part) the wisest and most admirable of the bunch. I have to go read Elvenblood!"
5,The BEST book ever,This book is the best book I have ever read. It hooks you from the first chapter and never lets go. You must read this book
5,Great knife - be careful,"Super knife with just the right features. Read other reviews for accurate comments.Note: The one handed opening feature means that in the ""shut"" position, the blade is not held in the sheath firmly. If you drop the knife, it usually opens partially. I've never had it open in my pocket, but I have dropped it numerous times and the blade becomes exposed. Once I dropped it (while it was shut) and the blade opened and was sticking straight up.Obviously never buy this knife for a child."
2,dissappointing,"I really like the author A LOT, he seems very approachable and friendly and definitely knowledgeable. Therefore I feel a bit sad that I own this book. It's basically a compilation of a number Thelema Libers EASILY available legally for free online.. and then some few comments written by the author himself about each Liber. The concept of the book would have great potential if he had actually written something substatial, meaning 5x more about each Liber."
5,SetiDraconis,"I recommend this book, alot of books on Thelema can be hard to understand and follow and this book is to the point.Excellent beginner book to Thelema and the Magick of Alister Crowley it will pave the way to more advanced books.SetiDraconis"
1,for babies????,"This book is a waste of paper. It is not proper description of the rituals. It waters down Crowley. It has little value to any magician. Lon Duquette is a wonderful human being, this book weakens the 93 current so badly that it is hardly any use. If you want to know about the magick of AC read Magick and learn the stuff by trial and error. Lon has other books that are great, but this is not one of them."
4,I like this..,"This is good. Lon Milo talks to youHey!..like he's your Bud.. and Makes Crowely's life coMe alive On eAch aNd eVery Page..RAndAll PikE wAnts to write a book about Crowely so we'll see..But Crowely biographies are supposedly steeped in so much arcane and hard to understand languagE. Who WAS this man? I also reccommend ""The Illustrated Beast"" by Sandy RObertson. Hope you all find your way to this mysterious man, who Lon knows wEll from study with correct Golden Dawn heritage lineages..If there's such a thiNg. Lon is quite a fair man, and Sandy Robertson's book should supplemenNT this.."
5,Love this book!!!,"I have used this book many times to make over 2 dozen bags. I have had so many compliments and requests for me to make bags for others. It has been great fun. I only use the basic design of the bags however, and embelish to my own taste. I do not use any of the suggested fabrics or embelishments in the book. The basic shape and design of the bags are great for me because I do embroidery work on the large blank space the bags offer. I use mostly faux suede for my bags and they come out beautifully. I do agree some of the designs as they are represented in the book are not to my taste, but the instructions are great."
2,"TACKY bags, not one practical bag in the entire book!","I was looking for a book to make elegant, simple and practical bags. This book has is all feathers and beads, nothing that I would ever give to someone as a gift! I was very disappointed."
4,good bag,"nice bag for my 15"" macbook. feels like good protection and quality. only thing is i wish they had added an extra compartment specifically for the charger."
5,Fantastic Carrying Case (Sleeve with Handles),This is a great carrying case. Neoprene protection that is specifically made for the Macbook Pro family. There is an internal fold of material that shields the zipper from the computer case. It's big enough to carry my Apple Mouse + Power Supply + Security Cable Lock + a couple of file folders worth of work.It's not oversized so that it temps you to cram a bunch of junk in to it. You take what you NEED and that's it. I love it!
4,Great product for teaching topspin and slice,My only issue is that it bends so easily when a student hits the ball with too much force. I wish it was a little more durable as its a fantastic teaching aid.
4,Worked for me,"I found this product worked rather well. I wouldn't want to run a marathon in it, but then who wears a stick on bra for a marathon? I found the sizes run a little large, though. So, if you're between sizes then best go for the smaller size. My favorite thing about it is that while no bra straps show, it still gives that ""I'm wearing a bra"" supported kind of look, which makes for fewer obnoxious comments when there are a bunch of rude men hoping the woman might be braless. (Not that she necessarily APPEARS braless; I think people just like the IDEA.) This is a plus side I have not experienced with many other varieties of stick on bras."
1,BAD,"This product is not good by any means,first the bra does not stay on very well and it takes forever to put it on,I ended up going braless,also don't wear with a white thin dress,you can seethe bra through it."
3,Interesting,"Good to read in parts if you are interested in uk literary scene in this period or in placing Fowles' novels in the context of his life and personna. Comes over as somewhat name dropping after a while but it is,supposedly, his private journal."
3,Aliage,"It did not smell like Aliage I guess since it is so old. I was disappointed but guess I should have known it would not age well, Not like wine right????"
5,perfect,"After searching for a pushbar for my full-door screendoor in local hardware stores, door stores, and the big-box stores, I found exactly what I wanted here."
5,Good stuff.. but the OZ math is wrong Amazon!?,Great stuff.. we use the liquid version of it a lot in seltzer water. But the PER Ounce math is all wrong.. its not (at the time of this review) $1.44/oz. $9.20 for 4 oz... closer to $2.30/oz. Buyer beware!
3,Religious agenda...,"As a pool player of some 22 years, I purchased ""The Pool Room"" expecting what the blurb promised; a story of ""some very unique characters that frequent a pool establishment"". While the book does deliver that, albiet in a rather pedestrian writing style, the later chapters introduce a subplot of Christian conversion of one of the characters, complete with biblical verses. As this was not what I was looking for, I was less than thrilled with the purchase.If you like your fiction to have an insirational message, give ""The Pool Room"" a try, by all means. If, however, you just want to read about pool, I would recomend David McCumber's ""Playing Off the Rail"" as a better choice."
5,Build A Gir In Six Easy Steps...,A captivating slice of life on how traditional nomadic tent dwellings- known as gir- are made from start to finish on the Mongolian steppes. Highly recommended!!!
3,"Not as ""cool"" as you'd think",The picture is misleading. The product was loose on my dog and not as cool as it looks. My son refuses to walk her with this set so I will have to invest in soemthing else.
4,good for 3 year olds but...,"beware of 7 minutes of anime previews that are very innapropriate and violent for the younger set (what were they thinking?). After fast-forwarding through this, however, the video is entertaining and tries to teach good manners and respect for the family. In short: expect fast-talking/helium-pitched Hello Kitty entertainment in a semi-anime style for children that spouts a few good messages. My 3 year old loved it."
1,Butcher knife scene is frightening! My 5 year old screamed!,"I previously reviewed this item but my review has disappeared. This video is mostly cute. But there is a scene with a cute character who turns into a witch and sharpens a butcher knife while cackling about how she has Hello Kitty and Mimi captive in her house. She grows sharp teeth. Another character tries to save them but the witch turns him to a statue. It scared the heck out of my daughter, who can watch even the scariest Disney films. I e-mailed ADV Films twice with my concerns but they didn't reply. I don't recommend this video."
1,Wrong title!,"When I purchased the book I thought that I would be receiving a book that talked about finances for the single parent. However, it is more of a book with very basic fatherly-like advice. While it may have given some well intentioned advice it really said nothing significant about finance at all. In fact, the other thing that even resembles finance was the chapter on making budgets. Which consequently, has nothing to do with a single parent. Again, the author may be a wise and very kind person but if you want to know about finances for a single parent, this is not the one for you."
2,Other releases more worthwhile... more for collectors.,"For the Phil Collins fans, there's way too much coming out that is worth buying: ""The Video Show"" on DVD containing 32 videos going back to ""Trick of the Tail"" (in 5.1 and DTS) and ""The Platinum Collection"" on 3 CDs, covering ""Trespass"" to ""Calling All Stations"". Phil Collins' solo material is covered on his live DVD being released in November which includes 22 promo videos (not complete, and some glaring omissions but still a pretty hefty set) and a bunch of other stuff (specials).Other than ""The Lamb"" having little footage, hopefully the Peter Gabriel era footage that does exist will be released down the line or buried in the ""extras"" on the DVD. There's a 45 minute film they did in 1977 while Steve Hackett was in the band, and a lot of footage they did from 1971-1973 that would be great to see as well as ""Live in Oxford"".The footage on here is nice to see, but if they release ""Three Sides Live"" on DVD from 1982, it would be worth the wait."
3,music,"The Very Best of the Rat Pack is a good c d. I was hoping for more of them singing together. All the songs on here I have on the individual cd's from each of them. If you want to hear each one sing alone, it's a great one to have."
4,Perfect background music for your next Mad Men party...,You gotta appreciate the intoxicating intoxication of the Rat Pack. Perfect background music for your next Mad Men party or any cocktail party.
4,cd,"i bought this for my wife who loves the rat pack and she has enjoyed the cd, not all thesongs are great but when the price is right, its fine"
5,Lou,I absolutely love Shepherd's Notes; I find it to be the most accurate reference tool available onscripture. They are easy to read and understand. I have about 40 of the 66 Books of the Biblein paper copies. But on the Kindle it is awesome because it is always at my finger tips.The Book of Mark is a must for every Bible scholar.
1,Impossible if you read your Bible as God intends,"Very readable and easy to follow. However>>>>Questions: If our free will limits God to nonawareness of our future choices to preserve genuine libertarian latitude, what's to preserve our freedom if God can know our present choices while we are real-time making them? Doesn't His awareness of what we are freely doing inhibit our freedom of action so we cannot now do otherwise than as He sees or foresees? If our futures must be private and secure from divine certitude, why not our presents? Isn't only the past beyond libertarian interference by divine knowledge?"
1,Open Theism is openly false,"From the start, it is safe to say that this book is an interesting read for sure. However, the whole concept of open theism, in my view, is not even close to being true historical Christianity. It is potentially dangerous for the modern church. This issue has been reviewed by people such as John Frame and Bruce Ware who have provided a great argument against it. Boyd is both wrong and in contradiction in his arguments. The very same hermenutical problem Boyd is charging against those who hold to God's exhaustive foreknowledge is being committed by Boyd himself in his arguments. Boyd suggests that we should take the biblical text at face value when dealing with instances where the text implies that God ""didnt know"". But Boyd doesnt seem to take the text at face value when it says that God knows the end from the beginning. Overall, open theism is a bust and should be researched by the church today in order to guard its people against the threat."
2,Heresy!,"After reading this book, this is my inevitable conclusion of this book! I cannot describe otherwise. This is one of the most serious heresy to strike the Church. I am of the firm conviction that if the Church Of Jesus Christ adopts his view she is returning to the dark ages. Let me offer a few reasons: firstly, Boyd is mistaken in his theology. He seeks to understand God from his the human - relationship view-point, science. His exegesis from Scripture is at best shallow. Secondly, his criticism that the classical view of God is founded in Greek Philosophy is mistaken. I recommend this book for critical reading and definitely not for a new Christian."
4,An excellent point of view,Boyd does a great job at presenting a true biblical view of relationship with God. This book will challenge you.
1,VERY UNHAPPY,"We are very unhappy with this particular video. When you purchase Molly, Dennis or Neville, there is a description that they make ""their debut"" in this video. The ONLY place Molly appears is in one of the songs and it is only for a split second. My 3 1/2 yr old is very sad and said, ""this is very strange, where is Molly?"" He recieved her for Christmas and has been waiting for this video to come out. He finally earned enough reward points only to be dissapointed! How awful!"
3,More new characters on the way,"I only know so much about this DVD. All I know is that there will be 3 (or possibly more) new engines. Dennis, a lazy diesel.Neville, a steam engine who looks like a diesel. Molly, a strong, yellow engine who is quite sensitive. That's all I know for now, I'll keep posting when I find out more."
5,thomas,the kids enjoyed it several years ago when I got it -- sorry the confirmation is late - thanks so much
1,Why is Toppem hat so pissed,"It seems Sir Toppem hat is ticked in all the episodes. he booms, his mother is stern looking on her birthday (who is stern on their birthday &*$# ?)Some of the faces scare my 19 month old. There is NO RINGO on this DVD."
2,I'm on my best behavior,"My mom says, I am going to be on my best behavior on This Tuesday, If I have a good day, then I'll get Tales From The Tracks when I get home!"
4,"Good product, not as versatile as I hoped","This is a nice quality play pen, very easy to set up. It comes already attached and you just need to fold it out. I wished I'd known ahead of time that you can not take apart the panels if you wanted to adjust the size or use it as a gate instead - they are all attached, so that reduces your options."
5,Best book on VLIW,"Great Book For VLIW Approach, got me kick started on my shader architecture project. Now, I am designing an back-end in LLVM."
3,Works ok,This charger does what it is supposed to do...charge a battery. It is nice as I have both 6V and 12V batteries in my RV
2,A word of warning,Sony doesn't tell you in advance but apparently this charger base will only charge the supplied NP-NH25 NiMH rechargeable battery. I tried using several NiMH non Sony batteries but no deal. The manual does say you need to use Sony's battery which being a specialty battery is both expensive and not readily available. I find this not only absurd but offensive since Sony is basically screwing around since any bargain basement AA battery charger will charge a variety of brands and maH ratings. This is NOT a bargain basement charger!
1,Zero stars--avoid this type of mute,"I had this type of mute (threw it away). It kept falling off the bridge due to the bridge's vibrations. Each time it fell off, it left a nasty dent in the top plate varnish of my instrument. I thought I wasn't putting it on tightly enough. Finally figured out what was going on. I bought a leather mute. A rubber mute would be better too. The metal mute is fine if you play a violin and hold the violin up all the time. Otherwise, like if you play cello, do not get this mute."
2,works... when it stays on,"While the mute does its job decently, I have the worst time getting it to stay on the bridge! The top-heavy design practically makes its effectiveness in muting irrelevant. That said, if you can get it to stay put somehow, this would be a great little practice mute."
4,Very Good Read,"This was my first book by this author, and I enjoyed it. Since this one, I have purchased/downloaded 2 other of her books."
3,slow moving and scary thriller,"allthe other reviewers gave this book a top rating.unfortunately,i do not agree.it was very slow moving with one dimensional characters.although it was a good beach or snowed/in read."
4,Eeek! Don't read alone at night,"That title might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it was pretty scary quite a few times; fast paced and frightening. I really liked the characters and much of the story was quite realistic. It kept me on the edge of my seat for most of it. I was so hoping it wasn't Dr. Shea who ended up being the bad guy. It would be a great made-for-TV-movie."
1,RIP OFF,"Northern tool wont ship the pack Qty. on the add, they ship wehatever they feel like you should get for the price you paid,then blame amazon for the mistake. If you try to return the shippment you have to deal with northern and they make it hard to do. I dont know if you pay the shipping cost or not, I guess you find out when and if you get your money refunded by northern."
2,"Not very economical, but cuts fast.","These are low priced but wear out faster than other brands, like the widely available Dewalt discs. These cut well and are tough. I will try another brand next time."
5,Looking Back: A Book of Memories,"Newbery Award winning author Lois Lowry offers her fans a creative look into her life. Using photographs, Lowry spins vignettes of memories triggered by each photo. Each chapter opens with a quotation from one of Lowry's books. From the vignettes, we learn how her life has influenced her writing. This autobiography is a very personal and intimate conversation between friends. It will appeal to both adults and children."
2,Replacement plan,"2-Year Replacement Plan for Electronics Products up to $24.99I haven't tested this product yet, but I rest easier knowing I have it."
3,"goof candy, horrid shipping prices",The candy was just what I ordered but the shipping charges were more than the candy. Bought $32.00 in candy and they charged me $36+ in shipping. We will not order from them again
2,Reduced my appetite a little,"I wrote a review that gave mega 5 stars last month, but I decided to deleted that one and give a new review with 2 stars after trying hoodia hoodia after I saw what the other reviewer wrote.Basically I was taking 3 before lunch and 3 before dinner for 750mg each time. It did reduce my appetite but I felt an empty feeling between meal, so I was still thinking about food. I had a fight a bit not to eat snack. As for Hoodia Hoodia, I take only 1 (400mg) before meal and it actually makes me feel FULL after eating a very small portion. I also don't think about food as often between meal."
1,Does Not work for me!!!!!,"Hello, i just got these in the mail 2 days ago. The first time I took it I took only 2 equaling 1,000 mg, IT DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.The very next day I took 4 equaling 2,000 mg, AGAIN IT DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.Bottom-line: I will never buy this product again nor will I recommend it to anybody."
3,It is OK,"Doesn't seem to be real ""denim""...but, it is heavier duty than most others I have seen. I read where it fits well on a 31"" tire. Beware, I had to pull and tug to get it on my 31"" tire...and it still really doesn't fit all that well. Otherwise, it is ok."
2,Bestop Black Denim 61031-15 X-Large Tire Cover,"I have a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited with 255/75-17 tires. In the product description, the manufacture does not have the exact tires this cover fits so you have to rely on the customer reviews. I thought the tire cover looked exactly what I wanted and ordered the Bestop Black Denim 61031-15 X-Large after looking at other reviews on Amazon. When it arrived I tried to put it on the Jeep spare tire and it DID NOT fit. I then went back to look at the reviews again and found that Amazon puts the same reviews for Bestop tire covers on all the different sizes. I found one review where the customer with the same tires I have ordered the Bestop Black Denim 61033 XX-Large tire cover. He said this fit his tire perfectly so I will order that one."
4,"Tight fit, Good quality","My vehicle is a Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40, Tire size P235/75R15 on 15""x7"" wheels. The tire cover size I bought is a Medium, which is for a 29"" tire and the tire dimensions is exactly 29"" across.First off, the fit was tight. The spare tire I was putting the cover on was brand new and seemed to have lots of friction with the inner ""cotton"" which lines the inside of this tire cover. After trying to put the cover on with the tire on the ground, it turns out it is much easier when the tire is already mounted to the vehicle. (I didn't have the tire mounted because I was still assembling the tire carrier when the cover arrived).Align the slit on the bottom first before putting the cover on because it is a pain to inch by inch rotate the cover into alignment.Quality of materials is great, I put water on it and it just beads up and rolls off. Based on the quality of materials, I would buy other soft top equipment from Bestop in the future."
3,Tire cover,"It says it fits a 33"" tire,it does but barely. What I mean is it slips over the front and the elastic part sits right before the tires goes down in the back. Seems like it could fall off on the highway. We will see how long it will last."
4,cover up,bestop has always been good quality merchandise.this product is no exception.very good quality fit and well constructed.make sure you know your tire size so you get the right fitment.
5,Complex and Intricate Mysteries Unraveled,"This is a rather odd but very enjoyable book. It begins with a very brief introduction to different number systems and beliefs about numbers, covering the Pythagoreans, gnosticism, the Cabala, Islamic mysticism, medieval numerology and numerical puzzles. The bulk of the book is a kind of encyclopedia of numbers: each of the numbers up to 21 gets its own chapter; after that they are dealt with ""en masse"".Each chapter is an unordered and unstructured compilation of beliefs about the subject number, mostly drawn from Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Unfortunately, there is no attempt at cross-cultural comparative analysis or at relating beliefs about numbers to other symbolic systems.This book might better serve as a reference rather than a complete read. It is very interesting but might be too much for one reading."
4,For Those In Search of Truth,"For those of you who are searching for an explanation for all existence, this book is the one, since mathematics is the universal language.This book helps to find patterns of phenomonah such as things that occur by certain number. With this book and a tad of imagination, one can see ""how it all is"" and go in further pursuit of the truth. This book feeds that intense curiousity of those who are searching. Enjoy........"
3,Where is number 23?,This book provides deep insights in the nature of numbers... but number 23 is completely omitted from the book without the slightest explanation.
5,A must see for Jarreau fans.,"Al Jarreau is one of the few artist to join Jazz and Popular music, this video shows why. You can see that he really loves performing before an audience. There is only one thing better than this video, and that's seeing him in person. If you can get this tape you're in for a great show!!"
1,Great product timely delivery,We love these maps and Amazon has made life so much easier by having them as organized as they are. It saves me driving from Book store to bookstore to find what I am looking for. Not to mention how well packeted they come to stay in the wonderful condition they come in.
5,Good snap repair kit for soft-top,"Comes with all required tools, punches and snaps to repair the soft top and body snaps on any jeep cj/wrangler. All that is required is time and patience"
4,Lemchaheb never miss!,"This album from the late 80's has a different sound compared to the 70's classics, in fact it is very heavy on the acoustic drums, electronic drum loops and synthesized instruments. The album sounds very produced and lacks the raw energy of the old records. But fans of the band need not worry: the madoline, bendir, tbila, and the powerful voices are always present. The lyrics talk about the same topics as usual: despair, treachery, and corruption that eats away people's hearts, and the message conveyed is that of perseverance, doing good deeds and keeping a smile not matter what. Too bad this is the only album from Lemchaheb available worldwide, you need to be in Morocco to get the rest of their catalog, either on cassette or CD. If you need any info on Lemchaheb, Nass el Ghiwane and Jil Jilala, or Moroccan music in general, feel free to contact me."
5,Superb Hoooooooooj ! ! !,"Another great compilation from the Hooj Choons label. The first disk is pretty good with such classics as Paradise - Miro, Dream Universe - CM, and Day by Day - Solar Stone mixed by HoojChoons compilation mixer Red Jerry. But the second disk which is mixed by Lee Burridge is the best.Lee Burridge + Hooj = breakbeat euphoriaIts that spectacular sort of breakbeat trance that just makes your blood flow. It has great mixes of Lustral, Lost Tribe, and LSG.Also check out the other two Deeper Shades of Hooj albums.Hail to Hooj!"
5,A Total Mind Altering State of Euphoria,"If you know excellent Dance Music and you know Hooj Choons, it will be difficult to express the pleasure you get from experiencing this MasterPiece. These CDs will move every inch of your mind, body, and spirit."
1,Gone!,"Do not buy if you plan on mountain biking. Use it 200 miles on the road, then about 1/2 in the woods before it fell of and GONE! Never to be seen again. The mounting bracket sucks. Any slight bump and off it goes. Caught it once or twice, but three times is a charm, GONE! Kinda hard to comment on durability and operation if it's not on the handlebar anymore.......... Better off using electrical tape to mount. Now all I have is some wires and a nice replacable face cover."
1,Someone tell us how to buy a good bike computer please.,"The Vetta RT277 is a bike computer that provides cadence, still can't get it to work right, and distance and speed (all ok here). I use this on a trainer in my basement...that is proabably all I would recommend it for. IF you plant to use it on the road, buy your own plastic zip ties. The ones that come with the computer are about as cheap and poorly put together as the instructions and the device itself. Altogether, it works but I'm relatively disappointed with the quality of engineering and thought into actual installation and use that went into this device."
1,POS,"I have had this for several months and still can not get the cadence to work. Don't waste your money on this POS.Update - After numerous emails with the mfg'r and the total lack of function of the unit, they finally agreed to replace the unit. Waiting for their response with a non functional unit and about to go on a trip, I bought a Cateye with cadence and it works fine. So much for Vetta. Now let's see if I can get my money back."
2,Same standard as other Biztalk documentation,"Having spent a (painful) month with BizTalk now, I have to say there is nothing in this book that has actually helped me with any of the issues I've encountered.BizTalk Unleashed covers a lot of ground by not resting in any place long enough. Expression editor capabilites? Half a page won't help. Correlation giving you trouble? Two wordy pages won't yield any greater understanding. Need to know about configuring the native adaptors? The appendix chapter C isn't in the book or online yet. The list goes on and on.This book is only useful as a feature introduction, and even then the webcasts offer a better use of your time for this purpose. Webcasts; samples; blogs; newsgroups and just old fashioned experimenting are still the only way to get started with BizTalk."
4,The Only Book Availalbe for BizTalk 2004,"I understand the frastrations of the other reviewers towards this book. BizTalk 2004 is quite different from the earlier versions. BizTalk 2004 is not well documented and there is no other reference book available. Many of us waited anxiously for the arrival of this book and hoped it would biring us extensive and in-depth coverage beyond what was available online, in particular since one of the authors is Scott Woodgate, the product manager of BizTalk, wellknown in BizTalk community.To be fair, I believe this book desearves more than the current 2-star rating of average customer review. The authors promised ""complete coverage"" and they did a reasonable job to cover this product. If you are new to BizTalk, you have not choice. You should read this book since it is an authorative introduction.Scott, I give you 4-star rating to encourage you to provide more in-depth material online at your blog site or in another book."
2,Where's the beef?,"We can all do better by following your blog. After waiting this long, it's just too much elementary material."
1,Big disappointment,"While the original ""BizTalk Unleashed"" by Susie Adams was an excellent book about a poor product, this is a poor book about an (apparently) excellent product.Hardly any hardcore technical content. Calling trivial examples ""patterns"". The chapters about HWS, BAS and BAM left me totally in the dark. Definitely a missed opportunity."
3,Not advanced topics,"I had been waiting this book for a lot of time, but the topics are for introduction to biztalk.I found a lot information (tutorials, hand on labs, presentations, etc.) about advanced topics in internet that the authors didn't go deep.The Appendix C (online chapter) isn't published at this time."
1,shoddy and replete with errors of ommission and commission,The least the authors can do is review their own work and provide their readers with an errata or a list of corrections for the numerous errors in the book.I would love to get my money back. Reselling it in the used-book market would be a disservice to the buyers.
2,"its ok, but I'd rather spend time online",You'll get much better luck and practice with the online free material than this book
2,A lot more to be done,"We also awaited this book with baited breath. We experienced a nightmare in development when Biztalk 2004 was released with no documentation. Microsoft needs to pull their game even the Microsoft employees I spoke to agreed this was not how a product should be released. Biztalk has some very fierce competition in the Enterprise Application Integration space and I've heard of a few companies in NZ (where I'm based) dropping Biztalk 2004 mid development to go to SeeBeyond. Hopefully a third party will produce a better book. I suspect however that Biztalk 2004 will be a short lived product as Indigo is not far away (2 yrs) from release. As Biztalk shares much of Indigo's technology there will need to be a another release soon, bad strategic planning by Microsoft. It is however a very powerful product and I believe a good starting point but please no more painful releases."
3,Biztalk Beginner Book-,"For a beginner book, the book does have alot of explanation.The books requires a lot of fiddling to get the examples to work.So far this is the best book out for biztalk server 2004. The book is very comprehensive and a very good tutorial.The explanations are a blast!It would be nice if the following solutions to the below problems could be provided. They are both very importanttechniques.The example submitting to a webservice enclosing an orchetration using infopath does not work p426-428The example in chapter 19 p598-599 does not work since the information to configure the machine to handle msmqt and msmqcould not be found"
2,SSDD - Much like it's predecessor (Site Server),"Like Site Server - you won't find a ton of material that is actually useful about this technology.[...]as well as other online resources.Sorry, guy. We want to give you a big pat on the back, but that's kind of improbable under the current book conditions. This has been a current problem since back in the day when Site Server first pushed into the marketplace (if you will recall that mess, and that BizTalk's features used to be part of the pipeline configurator mechanism for extending SS-EC to full EC-functionality).Give it another try. Still, something is better than nothing, but in terms of spending personal money, I'll pass."
2,Outdated,"This book was written almost 15 years ago and is no longer valid. I think the author is not from the US and has probably written Brittish comedy or something, if you can even call it comedy. The book claims that the author has been writing comedy since 1955. 1955 was probably the last time any of this information meant anything. If you want to become an obscure hack, read this book."
1,For Kindle only,would not work at all on my iphone or mac. It completely froze and Amazon had to disable it.
3,Definitely not for medical students in the MD program,"As much as it is a handy medical dictionary,I do not recommended it for medical students. It is very general and for someone in med school, it is not recommended for AP, Medical Biochemistry, disease or syndrome info, and drug info. The ""Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary"" or ""Stedman's"" is the recommended medical dictionary.For the layman, Merriam-Webster Medical Desk Dictionary is definitely recommended. :-)"
4,book review,"There are still medical some words/terms that are not listed in book. The book is good and helpful, but not perfect."
1,Could not set this as default dictionary,"Description of Kindle edition of this medical dictionary stated that this book could be designated the default dictionary, to be used for looking up words in other Kindle books. However, I could not set this dictionary to be the default on Kindle for PC. The ""Dictionary"" selection under ""Options"" did not offer that selection after this book was downloaded to my Kindle for PC. Did not see any warning that this book might not be installable as the default dictionary on Kindle for PC. Returned for credit."
5,Deep Insight,"This book presents a distinctly different look at the questions posed about the nature of psychopathy, and society's response to it. One achieves both greater understanding, and insight into the importance of individual responsibility and free will, even in the alternate universe of the sociopath."
2,Less than compelling,"Any belief system seems opaque to outsiders. Psychoanalysis was a very important step towards understanding and treating psychological problems but we have mostly left it behind, like Aristotelian physics. Without a basic sympathy for psychoanalysis this book becomes a series of unrelated assertions with the odd piercing insight; (the skewering of health bores is very amusing). Relatively low in ideas per page I'd say it is of mainly historical interest now. The awkward expression mentioned in an earlier review is certainly a problem. This shouldn't be in the first five books you read about this subject."
1,Dont waste your money!,"I purchased this case for my DSCS90. I hate it! It is only big enough to hold the camera and nothing else. There is no handle to the case, in fact the case only has zippers and you are suppose to use the strap from the camera itself for the handle. The zippers do not stay in place and the camera can easily fall out of the case so I don't recommend doing this. Look for a better case for your new camera."
