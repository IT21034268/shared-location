3,Mediocre for Clancy,"I've enjoyed many of Tom Clancy's spy novels, and was looking forward to this one. Although interesting, it's a pretty slow-moving tale, and not as exciting as previous books. I enjoyed the characters, especially the Foleys, who have been featured in other books, but the writing was repetitious in places. How many times do we need to be told that the Rabbit needs to get the hell out of Dodge City? Repeating information is good if you're trying to make a point, but try to find different ways of saying it! All in all, a minor chapter in the saga of Jack Ryan, and a mildly enjoyable summer read, but not on par with Clancy's best."
4,The Bear & The Dragon Was Better....,"I may be the only person who thinks so.... But ... I thought that The Bear & The Dragon was a much better book. I found my attention wandering quite a bit, althought I did finish it in a couple of days. The telling thing? I haven't re-read it, yet, and I've had it since the day it was released."
2,"Entertaining for Clancy fans, others should skip it","Red Rabbit was a pretty good read, but disappointing to a long-time Clancy fan. Clancy always makes me want to continue reading, but there are some major flaws in Red Rabbit.1. Way too much profanity, nearly all of it unnecessary. He needs an editor.2. Clancy continues to use the same clich√©s to excess. Everybody is a ""pro"". Espionage is a ""game"" and everybody abides by the ""rules"". The repetitious language gets boring.3. For a character who supposedly understands the need for secrecy, Jack Ryan spills a lot of details to people who don't need to know what he tells them.4. The plot was much simpler than I expect from Clancy. Not really any twists."
2,Disappointed,I couldn't wait until the release date - I read TC almost non-stop- the Bear and the Dragon was brilliant- I bought Red Rabbit on opening day - 3 weeks later I am on page 80- Need I say more-Has TC gotten too fat and sassy to use the creativity that made him famous ? - What a drag !
2,"A lack of suspence, pacing","In previous works Clancy's ability to build suspense and create believable characters is what sustained the reader through the flat spots, but this book lacks both these characteristics. Further, as noted by others, the dialog is exceptionally wooden which accentuates the poor pacing. (Parenthetically I note that if Ryan calls his wife ""babe"" one more time, I'll scream; I habitually refer to my wife as ""sweetheart"" but not every single time! I also note that, contrary to what another reviewer stated, Starbucks was started in 1971 but given it's extremely small size at the time and the fact that it seems to have had no retail stores, Ryan would have had to be clairvoyant to buy stock in it.) Save your money unless you need a soporific."
1,Very Poor,"If any writer on the planet submited this book to every publisher on the planet, they would have gotten a thousand reject slips. This is not only Clancy's worst, it is the worst novel I've read in several years, and I read fifty to sixty per year. I think Clancy needed the money, maybe had some bad investments, and banged out this nonsense to get it. This book could have been cut to fifty pages, and could have been an opening chapter to some other book. NOW, watch- the paper back will have great reviews: ""action packed page turner, kept me up all night..."" They all lie, big time."
1,Look what Tom Clancy found in his attic,"While looking aroung the attic one day, Tom Clancy found an old manuscript he wrote many years ago. The writing was boring, the plot dull and the characters unbelievable. ""What the heck"" he said to himself, ""I'm famous"". So the book was published, and millions of us bought and read (as much of it as we could) this drivel. Tom laughed all the way to the bank."
2,"Clancy has written some great books, this ain't one of them!","Let me start by saying that Clancy is by far my favorite author and has written some of the best modern American fiction in our time.Unfortunately, this book was the most disappointing of the lot. The build up tension was great, up until a certain point in the book, then it just got boring. The ending was entirely too predictable. I think it's time for Clancy to just end the Jack Ryan saga, revisit what made his first books so great, and start again with fresh new characters.Sorry Tom, you've just written far better books than this one."
1,Re-read an old Clancy instead,"Perhaps deadened by the numerous Clancy-sponsored, 'insert author's name here' Op-center paperbacks (or his non-fiction backgrounders on military topics), Clancy forgot the critical element of excitement in this one. Set back in the early '80s, we observe a very linear, very boring story play out over 600 pages--600+ pages you'll never get back. There were hundreds of opportunities for the plot to take an unexpected, interesting turn, yet in every case, everything went according to a dull plan. I finally realized that no twists were ever coming about 75 pages from the end and agonizingly paged through to the ending very disappointed.Here's a plot as exciting as the one in Red Rabbit: Cops learn of a bank robbery plot. They set up bugs in the hideout and overhear the plan. Police hide inside the bank to catch robbers. Robbers enter the bank. Police catch robbers. The End.Re-read an old one of Clancy's novels instead."
1,The Worst Novel Authored Solely By Clancy,"Remember the Sesame Street game: ""One of These Things Is Not Like The Others""? If you played that game with Tom Clancy's books, this book would be the answer. He usually writes entertaining techno-thrillers, but not this time. He's certainly entitled to an occasional screw-up. However, this one was a major boner!This has to be one of the most boring books I've ever read in my life, though I did actually slog through it. Too little plot, and too much dragging on and on. It might have been a good short story or novella, or a chapter in some other book. It almost seems like he had to fill a page quota.Do not buy this book, even from the bargain bin. It is not worth paying for. If you feel you must read this cure for insommnia, check it out of the library. Be sure to return it on time. I didn't, and ended up resenting the overdue fines I had to pay for it."
2,I'm still waiting for something to happen!,"The first 50 pages and the last 50 pages were pretty good Tom Clancy writing. The stuff in between was just that -- stuff. This was just a one-dimensional book - it had one plot - none of the subplots that Clancy's books always have. If you're a Clancy fan read it b/c it's still Clancy, if you're not, pick another one to read first!"
1,Red Rabbit Needs to Die a Timely Death,"I am a fan of Tom Clancy, but this seems to be his worst effort so far, except for the the collaborative work he has done. While it is interesting about the Foleys, the whole idea is small and drawn out interminably. I also found this novel to be his most jingoistic so far. Now, that is really going some. Clancy is an ultranationalist and has no time for the cultures of other countries whatsoever. The comments about the UK and Italy were especially loathsome. I am a Canadian and yes,we have to wait to for medical procedures occasionally just like the British. But, we do not have 40 million people (more than the population of my country) without medical insurance because they cannot afford it like the USA. I finished the book because it that is just the way I am, but it was not worth my time and I really am tired of Americans thinking that there country is the best place on the earth to live."
1,Save a bullet for me,At least that's what I told my wife if she ever saw me pick up a Tom Clancy book again. What a painful experience. There have been a lot of comments about the profanity in the dialogue but stupidity would be a larger concern. I have heard more intelligent conversations late at night at local beer joints than in these hallowed halls of government. It took Clancy (and us) 600 plus pages to get through a story that LeCarre would have made brilliant in half that space. Tom is like an aging ball player who has hung around too long. Hang it up partner and thanks for the memories.
2,Shouldn't have started,"Despite the numerous poor ratings, I gave this a shot. Like so many others, I was very disappointed. It's not an action story - there's three shots fired around page 625. It's not a spy story - every ""spy-like"" effort goes perfectly and there is little ... actually no ... intrigue. Everyone has a bad day, and I'll give Tom Clancy another chance on his next book. But once I started I felt compelled to finish in the hope that it would get better. It didn't. If you are looking for classic Clancy fiction, take my advice - skip this one."
3,College Student lover of Jack Ryan series,"First things first. While I do enjoy the huge war epics that Clancy has written, I am much more a fan of his intellectual small-scale 'warfare' novels. I agree with many reviewers on here that the book has some extraneous fluff. However, given the number of books and plots of them that Clancy has written, the options he has left limits him in plots of new books. Red Rabbit is a slow thinker-thriller that is average compared to other Clancy books and pretty good compared to other authors of the same genre. Red Rabbit takes you through the daily KGB activities and functions and gives you an idea of British intelligence services. While everyone knew what was going to happen at the end, it was fun to see how they got there. What keeps you in this book is Ed and Mary Pat. Though barely mentioned in Teeth of the Tiger, they ought to be a central role in the book after Teeth/Tiger. All in all, not a bad book if you enjoy the intricacies of espionage."
1,Short Story Masquerades as Novel,"Worst Clancy book by far. I used to like Jack Ryan, but Clancy has turned his once strong character into an ever-whining, sniveling wuss. The book has steered away from action and become a vehicle for Clancy to preach about every ill that ever bothered him. If you skip this one, you won't miss a thing. This may very well be the last Clancy book I ever buy. I will definitely read the reviews before committing to another Clancy novel."
2,A great 250-page novel - too bad this one is 600 pages!,"Tom Clancy had it all. His first four novels were terrific, and I literally stood in line to buy each new volume. Then, Mr. Clancy somehow made the grave mistake of believing he was above editing. His last four or five books are readable, but barely. Red Rabbit is unquestionably the most overwritten book I've ever read--which is to say Clancy could have used ten words when he used 40. Red Rabbit is WAY too long, and the plot drags along in places in a way I've never seen in a book from a major publishing company. The backstory on Jack Ryan should have been interesting, but this boring manuscript makes me seriously wonder why I would ever buy another Tom Clancy book again. If you love this author's early work, avoid this book--it will singlehandedly destroy the Jack Ryan franchise for you forever."
2,Worst Jack Ryan Book So Far,"I have to say I was pretty disappointed with this book. I think the same story could have been told in a book about a third of the size. Clancy repeats himself continuously and parts of the book even seem out of order, confirming my believe that Clancy writes his books in parts and sews them together at the end. I plodded my way through this book, reading an endless amount of rhetorical questions, waiting for some sort of Clancy pay off and was bitterly disappointed. A long time ago, Jack Ryan history left real world history. They shouldn't be merged back together, should they?"
2,Time to reread the earlier books,"What was he thinking when he wrote this? I need another few million bucks? As his novels have evolved, you tend to wait longer for the action to occur. But it finally occurs in the other novels. Not in this one. Absolutely nothing exciting happens. If you want an inside look at the spy business, this will be of some interest. If you want entertainment, start with Red October and read forward."
1,"You can afford an editor, can't you?","There is nothing worse than a six hundred page book that could benefit from not just good, but ANY editing. It is incredibly annoying to have the same trite metaphor, or the same random fact (dropped in to demonstrate that the author is clearly in the know) repeated within two or three pages of each other....multiple times within the book. Sometimes, it appears that Clancy writes each chapter, and other than the basic plot line, completely forgets what he has written, and so uses the same literary devices over and over. Yes, it is an interesting premise, but the writing has devolved so far in the past couple of years as to distract from the story. Please. Please. Hire an editor, and let them edit your books."
1,Take A Pass On This One,"This is not Tom Clancy's best day. I was disappointed in ""Red Rabbit"". It's too late for me, I already bought the book. But my advice to everyone else is --- take pass on this one. Read Bowden's riveting ""Blackhawk Down"" and Remick's outstanding allegory for what it is to be an American, ""West Point""."
1,A slow book,"I am usually a fan of Tom Clancy's fictional works, but not this one. I struggled to finish this book because of the slow pace. The book is filled with useless dialog which adds to the feeling of it just dragging on and on."
2,Red Rabbit... unpublished if not written by Clancey,"KGB insider plans to defect and tell his secrets. The CIA brings him out according to plan. End of story.No suspense. No suprises. No action.Let me look again, maybe this was written by Tim Clancey, not the Tom Clancey that wrote Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising.I guess he had a contract to write another, and ran out of time. He also ran out of ideas, so he just rehashed all the cliches he invented for his previous books, redeveloped (not as well) all the characters he already invented, and left out the suspense that he couldn't figure out how to work in.I felt cheated. Of my money, but moreso of my time."
2,Come on Tom Get Back To The Good Stuff,"This has to be, of the Jack Ryan series, the worst of the lot. I am highly disapointed. It is very dry, slow in action and plot. I love the series, or would have given it only one star. Yes it fills in some blanks, but after ""The Bear and The Dragon"" this book seems like someone else wrote it trying to copy his style."
2,Clancy needs to find new charcters and revive his writing,"You will be extremely disappointed- long and rambling without much techno or thriller. Not worth buying, even in paperback.Borrow the copy from the library and save the $$."
2,Becoming complacent,"Tom Clancy must feel that his status is secured in the literary world. Why? Well, simply put, this book is nowhere near the level with with Tom Clancy is capable of. It seems as though he (or quite possibly his publisher) felt that just putting a book out there with his name on it would sell thousands. Alas, that may well be the case.For me, the book seemed to drag on and on with no direction or purpose. While the story is centered around the assassination plot, there was no depth. It made me feel as though I were reading an amateur author's first attempt at writing. The characters were two-dimensional, the plot was weak for most of the book, and it simply was NOT a Tom Clancy novel.All things considered, I would recommend passing on this book. Tom, if you're out there, come on now. I am surprised you put your name on sometihng like this. You of all people are capable of so much better work!"
2,A Clancy Disappointment,"I'm a Clancy fan, having read all his other novels, and I must admit that this was a disappointment. What makes Clancy great is the treatment of so many story lines at once, keeping you interested in various story threads. In this book, though, the number of threads is greatly reduced and the reader is left wanting more.Reading this book is worth it only if you are a Clancy fan in need of a fix. Since I'm in that category, I can overlook many of the flaws but still ask Mr. Clancy to please take more time with his next novel and truly deliver like he knows how."
2,Boring,"I've read all of Tom Clancy's novels, and have loved all of them . . . until this one. Where all of Clancy's previous novels have been full of intertwining plot threads which weave and wind until they all come together and culminate in an explosive, breathtaking climax, this book just plods along and leaves the reader waiting for something interesting to happen, which unfortunately never develops. The usual complexity of his plot twists just aren't there, and what looked to be a promising and interesting story never really goes anywhere.If you're a casual Tom Clancy reader, or are new to Clancy's works, stay away from this dud because it's really not typical of his usual high-quality of writing and suspense."
4,Not Clancy's Best Effort?,"OK. Red Rabbit is not my favorite Tom Clancy book of all time. However, I found the book to be a very enjoyable read. There are many familiar characters from Clancy's earlier works, and he gets the opportunity to flesh those characters out. It is certainly more believable than Jack Ryan being the president. I particularly enjoyed the detail of ""spycraft"" that Clancy developed. This book could be a lesson book for wana be CIA operatives. If you want present day political situations, this book is not for you. However, if you don't mind re-hashing cold war politics, you will likely find this book very entertaining.I can't wait for Clancy's next book, and was grateful to have been able to read this one."
2,Limping Rabbit,"Ok, I'll admit it, I'm not really a Tom Clancy fan (in fact, I've only read one of his other novels, and that was YEARS ago). But the idea of a fictionalized account of the assassination attempt on JPII intrigued me. Boy, was I disappointed! This book has very little plot, and a lot of charcter development. A little too much for my taste. The assissination attempt doesn't happen until page 620 - the novel has 636 pages. Clancy uses the same terms and expressions over and over and over again, and he took poetic licence with the dates (the actual assissination attempt occurred in May 1981 and not August-September 1982) and he misspelled Cardinal Wyszynski's name (minor typo, I know, but it still bothered me).Clancy wasted an opprtunity to write a heck of a thriller. In stead of exciting the reader, the red bunny limps along. Over all, it's not a book I would recommend."
2,"Should have been called ""Hunt for a Red Editor""","One third the story, three times the words of Clancy's best. The plot: It's 1982. Russia is the Evil Empire. A KGB defector reveals a Soviet plot to kill the Pope. The Pope is shot but lives and Jack Ryan is somewhat involved. That's the story. Period. The other 620 pages delve into the fascinating details of Jack's preference for coffee over tea, the quality of Russian fur hats, the incompetence of British eye surgeons and why English faucets have both hot and cold handles, plus a million other pointless musings. After every journey down a new stream of consciousness, Clancy throws in a flashback to Patriot Games, Jack's helicopter crash, his career on Wall Street or his Jesuit education. Then it's time to repeat some other opinions of English beer, Russian architecture or what's for dinner. This could have been a fairly entertaining 200-pager but instead Clancy's bloated prose is as boring a 20-year old history lesson."
1,YAWN!!!,"Let me begin by stating that Tom Clancy was one of my favorite novelists, however he remains a casulty of the breakup of the Soviet Union. He hasn't really written a decent book since and this is a [bad] attempt to regain some of the past glory of his brilliant stories before the collapse of the Soviet Union.This book contains no suspense at all. The characters do not encounter any difficulties with anything they attempt, which would remain a problem even if this book was a third the length.And you could easily chop two thirds of this novel by freeing us from having to endure endless and repetitive information regarding the saintly qualities of all of the lead characters. Did I mention the repetitive nature of this information? Did I mention the repetitive nature of this information? Did I mention the repetitive nature of this information?By far the worst Tom Clancy novel ever and right up there as one of the worst novels ever written.Signed,A very disappointed fan"
1,BORING!,"Clancy must have had a book due under contract and this was the best he could throw together. I'm a huge fan of the Jack Ryan series and was eagerly looking forward to the ""next installment"". Well, instead Clancy hands us a historical look at Ryan that is far from thrilling and never captivating. If you really must read this novel, check it out from the library - then you'll be getting your moneys worth."
1,Worst Clancy yet,"There are not many positive sides to this piece of literature. The story is somewhat interesting if you are interested in cold-war politics and especially the intelligence service. However, personally I found the book too much biased to my liking even in this aspect. The characters are not very interesting and the way Clancy portraits Jack Ryan as a totally flawless jack-of-all-trades made me sick. Add a simply awful dialogue and a plot thinner than George W Bushs intellect and you have a book not worth reading in an isolation cell at Guantanamo.Considering that I really enjoyed Mr Clancys early cold-war fiction this makes it even more disappointing.How unbelievable as it may seem, this book is really as silly as its title."
3,What a letdown.,"Thought I was going to tear through this like I did the Bear and the Dragon. Still a good read, but not Tom's best by far. I found the fact that Ryan bought stock in Starbucks to be interesting the first time I read it, but by the last time I read it you'd think that they are part of the plan to bring down the Wall. That's it! That is the plan. American Consumerism at it's best. Open a Starbucks in Red Square and the virus will supplanted in the heart of the enemy! I know that this could have be incorporated into the next story and cleaned up a lot."
3,A Promising Start -- A Disappointing Finish,"I love Clancy's other books. I remember how captivated I wason reading my first, ""Red Storm Rising"". With all the shiftingbetween characters and settings in ""Red Rabbit"", I thought I wasin for another exciting journey. Sadly, this was not the case.I remember enjoying Clancy's treatment of John Clark's earlydays and was hopeful to get similar stuff on Ed and MP Foley.It was not to be...This book could've been really great. Instead, it feels likeClancy just decided to stop writing after page 545."
3,Its the Buda Hills and the Pest Plains,"Not the fastest moving of Tom's books. I probably enjoyed it more than most folks because some of it took place in Budapest where I'm researching a novel and the spy stayed where we stayed, but when describing Budapest in the book, he got it backwards! It is the Buda Hills and the Pest Plains! They are very different. I hope not too many Hungarians read that! I also believe that he does, as many other novelists do, and that is writing very thick books because it is expected both by the publisher and the public."
2,Clancy,Up to page 173 so far after 2 months picking it up and letting it down. Too slow and full of minutiae that was OK 10/15 years ago but is now well documented and passe. Does not seem to be written by Clancy. Maybe if I have the patience I will get to the ending!!A slow read.
2,Need more Jack Ryan,"Clancy hasn't written a good book since Executive Order. Bear and the Dragon is awful, as it this. No suspense, totaly predictable, my fifth grader could have figured it out. Clancy should be embarrassed. Sum of All Fears was one of his best. Executive Order was fantasitic. Red Rabbit was a waste of my time. I put down Patterson's ""The Beach House"" in favor of this. After struggling with Rabbit for 4 weeks, I finished it, then finished Beach House in 2 days. A fantastic book! I would highly recommend it, even though Alex Cross is not a character.Which brings up a good point. Ryan is only as good as Domingo Chevez, who wasn't in Red Rabbit. Maybe we have something here...I hope and pray Clancy comes up with his next book a winner!"
1,the book where nothing happens,"Tom Clancy seems to have lost the plot so to speak, and fails to find it in Red Rabbit. Essentially *nothing* happens in this book until about page 600 or so and then it's all over in 3 pages, so save yourself a lot of time and money by reading these pages in the bookshop as you browse and then replace the book on the shelf and walk out.If you are looking for an action packed thriller this is not the book to read, instead go and get Patriot Games or Hunt for Red October."
2,Disappointing and tedious,"Perhaps it's time for Clancy to hang up his boots. Red Rabbit is uninspired and frankly boring. Fans (like me) who have always found the Ryan tales an excellent airplane/beach read must be wondering why a good, potentially exciting, plot was wasted with endless repetition (count the number of ""get out of Dodges""), bad research (Clancy's England is unlike the one I grew up in) and unlikely opinion. The few occasions things looked to be getting interesting fizzled away to nothing. Ryan's younger character was not really believable and unlikely to develop into the Ryan of later books. I managed to finish the book, but read 3 others in between. Hard work."
2,Not ready for reading,"I remember the night I started reading his earlier book, Red October. I was down on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Dawn the next day found me literally holding my eyes open with my fingers to get to the end. That will not happen to anyone with this book. It is simply too formulaic. While Frederick Forsythe could turn an even less successful attempted assassination of Charles de Gaulle into the very suspenseful Day of the Jackal, Clancy has much less luck with the attempt on the life of the Pope. The idea actually has the potential for Clancy to have made a much better story, but he wastes it on showing how much he knows about the arcane world of spies and counter spies and on how much he thinks America is better than Soviet Russia was and how many hot stocks Ryan can identify before they take off. Sort of John O'Hara of the Big Board.There was never a willing suspension of disbelief and this book badly needed at least one, or two."
3,lack of action hurts a good story!,"this book has less action /blood/guts than your average clancy book,but it is still better written than a lot of other fiction books.It feels like tom clancy has peaked as an author three books ago.He is still one of my favorite authors but patrick robinson occupies the place that once was tom clancy's."
2,Wimpy,"I am a longtime Clancy fan and have read all his books. The thing I found most objectionable about this book was that Jack Ryan, who just previously saved the Prince from assasination and fought off various attempts to kill him spends most of the book agonizing over whether he is doing the right thing by taking a relatively non-hazardous field assignment. Gee should I be doing this? Gee what about my wife and kid? Etc. Etc. I found it to be utterly non-credible."
1,Don't buy this book,"I have never been so annoyed by a book as to wish to write a review of it. This book is not worth buying. it is truely atrocious. It has no tension, it is inconsistent and is a total waste of time. I have already wasted enought time on this. Enough said"
1,terribly boring.,"that says it all. make no mistake, i'm a clancy fan but in this novel, it seems to me that the author is experimenting in a different style of writing which has a shallow plot not typical of clancy. what's worst is when i listened to the audio book, the narrator's voice was so monotonous as if i was in a seance."
1,Sloooooooowwwww,"An easy book to put down. After his last novel I thought that was it. Then I thought that maybe someone else wrote it and I would give him one more try. Lord, what happened to the Clancy that wrote ""Red October""? I made it half way through ""Red Rabbit"" hoping for something exciting to happen and finally gave up. Didn't finish.There was too much political analysis here for me. I don't really care about the character of Lenin or Stalin. I know they were bad guys. I don't need Clancy laying it out for me in excruciating detail.It may be time for the author to see a ""pshrink"". (What's up with that anyway?)Try some Bill Buckley's Blackford Oakes or Ken Follett's WWII spy thrillers. This was the last Clancy I will try."
1,Not worth the effort it takes to read,"I'm beginning to fear that Tom Clancy has lost his touch. Unfortunately, not unlike Stpehen King, he will continue to put out book after book and continue to rake in the cash.This book is one you must force yourself to finish. I kept reading, determined to find where the excitement was. It never shows up.This book is full of long, rambling monologues spewing forth the right-wing, conservative slant that Clancy so firmly believes in. He could have shortened the book considerably by simply writing 'right=good, left=bad'.I will wait and read the reviews before buying another of Tom Clancy's books. Maybe he needs to take another look at what he is doing and reevaluate his style. But then why do that when every book you write, no matter how bad, is a guaranteed best-seller?"
1,Disappointing,"I've got all of Clancy's adventure books, and I've enjoyed them all up to now.This book was, utterly predictable, slow, and boring. At no point was there any suspense.Now that I think about it, this may be the closest any of his spy vs. spy novels has ever approached reality. I prefer his escapism."
2,Disappointing,About as exciting as Tolstoy (and as wordy). Clancy can't seem to let the cold war go (if he actually wrote this book). The only interesting parts are about Mary Pat and Ed Foley.
2,??? ! ! !,"This a major let down on Clancy's part. I wont waste my time on this book any longer than i have to. There are only 2 or 3 shots fired in the entire book. None of which are of any consequence. I am 14 and have read all of Clancy's books except for ""Red Storm Rising"". This is obviously the worst yet. I reccomend that you borrow this book from a friend. Dont bother wasting your own money on it. I love all of his books. The only one I hadn't liked so far was ""The Bear And The Dragon"", But this is going way too far.If you want to buy his best book of all time, buy ""Rainbow Six"". I hope this sends you a very clear message."
1,Clancy's getting worse and worse . . . .,"I've been a big Clancy fan ever since I was a submariner and Hunt for Red October came out. But his plots have become too predictable and his characters are too perfect. (Name a Jack Ryan flaw other than he sneaks cigarettes when his wife's not around.)Red Rabbit is the worst. The book contains some interesting insight into spy operations behind the iron curtain, but do I want to read a page and a half of the Ryan's morning routine or a several pages about how much Jack Ryan loves his wife? (No!)Tom Clancy is a father of this genre, but he needs to take some lessons from his proteges -- Neal Stephenson, for example."
1,repetitive blah,"here's a synopsis:a foreign government wants to do something to the pope; jack ryan doesn't like planes; america is the best; jack ryan doesn't like his father in law; the russians are pretty good, but the americans are better; the british are pretty good, but the americans are better; ryan doesn't like planes; cathy ryan doesn't like not sleeping beside jack; jack doesn't like not sleeping beside cathy; ryan doesn't like planes; america is the best place to live.... blah blah blah,THe first 3/4's of the book is boring and highly repetitive. The last 1/4 is OK.I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy's books containing more technical and suspensful content (i.e. most of the books before this one). This book had no suspense or cool technical stuff.THis book is barely worth reading and certainly not worth buying new."
2,Clancy Slipping!,The quality and readibility of the books of Tom Clancy keepgetting worse and worse.This book is just plain bad.The Russiansdecied to assassinate the Pope.His opposition to their policiesand actions make him a marked man.The Russians bring in a hiredkiller in the form of Agca.The Americans discover the plot and rush to stop it.No shots are fired until deep in the book.Thenthe book finally comes to an end.This book does not even comparewith the quality writings that we have enjoyed in the past.Thosewere the good old days. I hope that Tom Clancy rediscovers hisold self.
1,I won't blindly buy a Clancy book again!,"Normally, if I see a book written by Tom Clancy, I buy it. That won't happen again! I was very disappointed with this book. It plodded along for the first 300 pages before it got mildly interesting and once the Pope was shot, it ended with many questions unanswered.One was left to wonder what happened to the Rabbit family in America, who are the Minister, Neptune, and Cassius. What is the ""Masque of the Red Death""? Sounds like a cliffhanger sequel to me!Other things I did not care for were some of the slang that wasn't right for what might have been used in 1981. I.e.: sh..burger, wimp out. Also, I wish I'd counted how many times ""Getting the Rabbit out of Dodge City"" was used!All in all, not the ""Tom Clancy"" of old. I was extremely underwhelmed."
2,Who wrote this?,"After reading the first 50 pages, I couldn't help but post the question here that had been nagging me since I started Red Rabbit. Who wrote this? Is this the real Tom Clancy? Did someone else write the earlier and decently written books? Or did he write those and this is yet another ghost written book, only unattributed?Has Tom Clancy grown so sellable that editing is unecessary? Is he arrogant and uneditable? I search for an explanation because this book is miserable. It is poor writing, plain and simple. I can't finish it and wish that I hadn't spent the five bucks in the first place."
2,"Pretty disappointing, coming from the King","I have been a long time Clancy fan. This book is a sleeper. In fact, I am at page 301 right now, and I cant even read any more. I skipped half the pages actually, and didnt regret it... I dont want page after page of ... dialogue that signifies nothing. I want some action. I want suspense. Heck, I would even settle for some drama,... or even humor ...My advice is to go back and read Clancy's earlier books, and just skip this one."
2,Oh dear.,Well I don't really know where to begin. I hadn't read a Clancy book in a while because he was feeling a bit stale. But I came back to him for this one and found it to be hit and miss. Some great bits. Some flashes of old form. But largely this just feels thrown together. One for a completist I think.
1,"Worst Clancy Book, Bad for Any Book",How can a great writer do 600 pages of pure snooze material? The Bear and the Dragon dragged on for a long time but was vintage Clancy for the last two hundred pages. This book could have been written in 200 pages and it still would have bored me to death. Maybe he is just to busy to research and write the quality novel that we had come to expect. A true disappointment.
2,Clancy's worst ever,"I couldn't have been more disappointed with this disaster. Clancy is my favorite fiction writer, and I loved his books up through Executive Orders. But this one was a total loser.Jamming a story in between Patriot Games and Red October was a lousy idea to start with. We already knew Ryan's history, and by definition there couldn't be anything substantive in the book.Besides that, we all knew the Pope had been shot. There were virtually no interesting subplots, just lots of sleepy dialogue that didn't go anywhere. There were more false starts in this book than in any previous novel. Not a single interesting plot twist or thing-gone-wrong.Jack Ryan is such a terrific character - can't we find out what happens to him NEXT? Did we have to go back in time with a poorly conceived, disappointly executed, flat-out BORING story?If you're a real Clancy fan, be prepared for disappointment. No questions this is his worst book ever."
4,Fascinating read for history buffs,"The reviews for this book are all over the board. I think it is all due to what you want in a novel like this. Clancy's reputation for action and technical information is absorbing. But his research and clear knowledge of what seems like every little detail is incredible. In reading the book, I felt as if I, for the first time, really knew what the old KGB was like. The conversations between players such as Judge Moore, Greer, Ritter, Mary Pat and Ed taught me so much. Yes, this book is quite different from some of Clancy's books. Yet it seems thoughtful and well laid-out. I am a big Clancy fan and was extremely disappointed with ""The Bear and the Dragon."" It seems to me that Clancy has found his voice again. My only question is ""what's next?"" This has to be the last Jack Ryan book. There is nothing left for him to do. But if Clancy surprises me on that matter, he will truly prove to be a brilliant author. History buffs--get this book and enjoy."
3,Another good book by Tom Clancy Red Rabbit,"Another good book by Tom clancy.. He likes to have alot of charters and makes stand of the tips of your toes. Till the end, than it all comes out. So glad it wasnt a cliff hanger. The big thing is the big and bad KGB & his plot to assassinate the Pope. The book is set in the early 1980s. I dont want to give away the story. This is a very good book. the reason i didnt give it five stars is because there was not a huge amount of action than i thought there was gonna be."
4,"Good Read , At Least On Par with Other Clancy.","This book was at least on par with the rest of the clancy series if not better. The look into Soviet life and the feelings of the defector is really interesting. As well as the portrayal of the attempt on the Pope. Good book , i deffinetly recommend it. As good as Cardinal and in a similar style."
1,Russophobic junk,"I am not Russian. I am a Ukrainian. Yet I can not stand the fact that Tom Clancy always relives the Cold War in his books. This guy must have a deep hatred for Russians. He always romanticizes and depicts the CIA in a heroic light. This is the CIA that is responsible for the deaths of millions of innocents of the world. He idolizes Reagan, the same man who supported fascist dictatorships in Central-South America and Asia. The same man who provided fuel for the Islamic extremism that propagated the demon known as bin Laden. And I should not even get started on Margaret Thatcher. Oh, by the way, this book is damn boring!"
1,What a Shame!,"I started reading Tom Clancy after seeing my Idol Ben Affleck in the movie Sum of All fears. When I read the adaptation for that book I was not pleased the character based on the film is nothing like the book. They should of kept with the premise and character of the movie and not changed it. Well thats the least of the problems. I started to read this book and have found that it was a prequel to all of Jacks adventures. What I can't figure out is how he could have done any of this. His character in Sum is thirty, back track through the other stories and he would have to be 12, my age, it makes no sense. ..."
1,Giant Yawn,"Just echoing the reviews before me, but this was a giant yawn and a waste of time. Clancy is the master of the techno-thriller. However, Red Rabbit is a spy ""procedural"" in the genre of John LeCarre, but Clancy ain't no LeCarre.All the previous war, military, combat, technology, special forces emphasis covered up the fact that Clancy is a bore. Take away all that, as he's done in Red Rabbit, and you have nothing."
2,Disturbingly inaccurate,I like Tom Clancy and despite its many shortcomings noted by others I could have liked Red Rabbit too. But the incredible factual inaccuracies made me vince.His geography at times mixes East and West. He makes his Rabbit travel from Moscow to Budapest via Sophia and Belgrade and changes railroad tracks as they cross into Hungary.His geography and details of Budapest is a mixture of small irrelevant - but correct - details and sheer misinformation. A simple look at any tourist map would have shown him how wrong he is.How a writer of Clancy's reputation can efford not to have qualified reviewers - for a pittance - is beyond me.A disappointment that will leave me questioning all details in his books.
2,New editor needed...,"This book was disappointing, at best.Clancy needs new editors or he needs to listen to them better. How many times do we need to be subjected to the same lawyer joke, or Stalin's thoughts about the Pope's divisions, or that spycraft is easier than cutting eyeballs, etc.? The repetition became a distraction as I was reading the book - I kept saying to myself ""why did he mention this again?"".Either the editors don't have the guts to trim Clancy's books, or he feels he too great of an author to need an editor, or listen to one.A weak effort, with little suspense."
1,worst Clancy = almost worst book,"This book is an embarassment. It shows what happens when an author decides to just capitalize on past reputation. This book is so bad it actually makes you mad to be reading it. You almost wish for a government agency to protect the public from this kind of exploitation. Shame on the author, the publisher,and the booksellers."
1,"I'M sorry I ""red"" RABBIT","Oh No! A Tom ""Clunker"". This filler of a book between Patriot Games and Cardinal of the Kremlin is as exciting as STAR WARS Episode II. I understand a prequel or a sequel but these ""midquels"" have no surprises and are redundent. Len Deighton did it with great success but there was alot of mysteries to solve. In the first 100 pages, he repeats himself in this book dozen's of times(chess analogies,lawyer joke(not jokes),origin of KGB building,etc) Great title,read title and then throw away unopened book.I Loved his other books,so sad."
1,Far From Clancy's Best,"As someone who has read all of Clancy's novels to date, this was the poorest by far. It was carelessly edited so there are many typos and some scenes where military personnel are called by several different ranks with a few paragraphs. The plot is listless and unsurprising.Most distressing by far are the bizarre antics of Jack Ryan in this book. This is not the Jack Ryan of old - this one uses harsh and vulgar language freely - even with his daughter! He comes across as a very unlikable character.I was really looking forward to this book so I'm very disappointed. Mr. Clancy has shown he can do much, much better!"
2,Penance before redemption,"When you know the ultimate answer, did the pope survive an assassination attempt, before you begin, the writer needs to keep our attention. ""The Day of the Jackal"" accomplished this many years ago. This book isn't even close. Do we really need the personal political philosophies of every major character? Or the benefits of single faucet sinks? The last 100 pages is rewarding but not worth the effort of the first 500."
3,"Good, but not quite there yet","I found out this last book from Tom Clancy Ok, but it just feels that the story was made for a smaller book, since most of it just details a lot of stuff when A is waiting for B, and most of that could be skipped.Anyway, it's a good novel if you want to read large volumes (I do), but it's not up to the level of Hunt of Red October or The Sum of all Fears."
2,"Nope, not this one","A delicious mish mash of double entendre between those randy Foley's in Moscow. A compelling dialogue between the two Dr's Ryan. Gruff Admiral Greer and steely Yuri Andropov. You know, I actually put this book down in the middle of it (about the time Ed and Mary Pat's hand communications were going full bore) and read three old Forsyth novels, The Negotiator, The Fist of God, and The Deceiver.) I was begging to have a mole at Century House. I was crying to have one of the people around the Ryan's, whether it was the colleague, the Taxi Driver, or even the nanny, leave a note at a drop box and make a chalk mark on the wall. This one was a stinker. Come on Tom. I'm calling you out son, you can do better than this."
4,"Not bad, could be a decent movie (if made into one)","The latest book has similarities to the attempt on Pope John Paul II (from which Mr. Clancy obviously drew some of the story).Mr. Dennis Boutsikaris does a fair job of reading the text and keeping the story moving. He's better with the Russian accents than the British (but not as bad as some readers who sound ""forced"" when they try to do them). Better than most of Mr. Clancy's books. I'd also recommend his older The Hunt For Red October. Overall, could be a decent movie (as metioned in the title of this review). The story lends itself to be a made-for-TV movie, I think, rather than a theatrical release."
3,"Rather Tepid, Predictable and Unexciting","This book was quite a dissapointment. Not that it is bad, but it was not up to Tom Clancy's usual standards.There was no primary character or sense of danger, no real twists or turns, no excitement. Just a Ho-Hum narrative.The book concerns Jack Ryan just after ""Patriot Games"" but before ""Red October"".I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. It never did.The book is worth reading, but check it out from the library.If this is your first Tom Clancy book, you will feel cheated, and wonder what all the excitement is about.Any of the following would be a better choice for a first timer: ""Patriot Games"", ""The Hunt for Red October"", or ""The Sum of All Fears""."
1,Yawn,"Typically, Clancy spends a good deal of time and effort developing characters and the story, building up to a wonderful, fast paced ending. In this LACKLUSTER effort, I kept waiting for the Clancy of old but it is more than apparent that even Clancy has TIRED of Jack Ryan. A very DISSAPPOINTING effort and it has left me skeptical on any further Clancy books without thouroughly investigating reviewer comments."
1,Very poor indeed,"Not convincing, either in it's reason for the attempt on the Pope, the portrayal of the UK, or the characters.Regarding the assassination attempt he is at odds with the Pope's own memories and actions. ...On the UK, he is way out of line on the NHS. It is supported by all major parties, including conservatives, and the slur on surgeons is, frankly unforgiveable and narrow minded. Clancy does this a lot. In previous novels he has poked contempt at the UK for our gun laws, without mentiuoning the event that triggered it - a conservative member of a gun club slaughtering 16 seven year olds and their teacher.On the characters, Ryan comes across as a bit of an airhead.As a major fan of his work for years this is dreadfully disappointing.Will (Liverpool, UK)"
3,Continuing Clancy's trend of phoned-in efforts,"I have read all of Clancy's books, and I generally like the political minutiae and encyclopedic set-ups. What I liked the most about Clancy's work was that the characters seemed to have real challenges to overcome, and not everything when the good guys' way. This gut-wrenching tension has been missing in every novel since Rainbow Six. Everything in the book gets off without a hitch. The characters never seem to be in danger at any time, and that seriously limits the enjoyment of the story.Many of the passages seem to repeat themselves over and over again. There seems to be almost 150 pages of Ryan and his new cohorts telling each other that the Russians are predictable and that they can't surmise what's going on. There are another 75 pages of meeting between Ritter, Greer, and Judge Moore saying mostly the same things.Seems to be mostly a half-cocked effort on Clancy's part. Maybe the creativity is gone."
3,A Hard One To Digest,"RED RABBIT, loosely based on real-world events, revisits Jack Ryan's early CIA days in London, prior to his meteoric rise within the government ranks. He is debriefing KGB defector Oleg Zaitzev, who reveals a high-level Soviet plot to assassinate the Pope. This revelation pits Ryan against political enemies and allies which test his fortitude and put the balance of world power at stake.True to form, Clancy hands us heavy doses of technical information, evidence of his genius for laborious research. I found this ""regurgitation of knowledge"" a bit hard to digest, considering that the fast-paced dialogue and relentless action he is known for is all but devoid from this book.RED RABBIT is a valuable source of information, but can prove to be a formidable challenge, even for the most die-hard Clancy fan. It tends to read more like a 618-page documentary rather than a work of fiction."
5,Reading a book is not about getting to the last page,Tom Clancey has brought a number of fictional people to life in his books. Red Rabbit only goes back and fills in some gaps that have been alluded to in other books. What I like best about his writing is that the story is real and alive. It takes place like life one hour at a time. The only disappointment I have when reading one of his books is when I am nearing the end and know that in only a few pages my old 'friends' will be saying goodbye until I can find another book.If others are like me they will enjoy all his books and find them exciting at times but always believeable and his fictional people are just as real as if reading a reallife biography.In Red Rabbit there is the hope that there will be an unending stream of new books filling in other chapters in the lives of people readers have come to admire.
3,The Big Pink Bunny,I usually enjoy a Tom Clancy thriller. But his one didn't do it for me. At one time it could have been interesting to know how and why our Russian friends tried to assassinate the pope. But the Cold War ended about 12 years ago and with it so went the mystery and intrigue of what motivated mother Russian to do what she did.Less than two months ago President Putin visited the Vatican to speak with the pope. The reason for an assassination has long been lost and with it the drama for this story.I think this book could have been written with about 50% less words. While I found the story very interesting from the Russian point of view I did not find the lives of the Western spies so very engaging.I look forward to the next Clancy offering.Cammy Diaz Attny @ Law
1,Worst Clancy ever?,"This was absolutely horrible. I read it all the way through, hoping it would get better but it never did. Predictable, dull, uninspired -- and I usually like his books. And, come on, did someone at Starbucks pay him for a product placement? Skip this one, there are many better ones out there."
2,The Others Already Said It,"Not a good intro to Clancy. I did finish it, but for those used to Clancy, it's a slow-paced read. I didn't hate it and I did finish it, but my advice is wait for the next ""real"" Clancy. Probably the least interesting of Clancy's works (I've read them all, but won't touch Clancy and whomever)."
3,This bunny keeps going and going...for too long,"Certainly not one of Clancy's best. The book goes on about twice as long as it needs to for what actually happens; and what does happen is a little slow for the most part. If it didn't involve the Pope, this story would only rate as a subplot in one of Clancy's best novels. I also agree with the other reviewers about oddly repeated sentences and the numerous Starbuck's references (own some stock and trying to drive the price up Tom?). Worth a read if you like his other books, but you might want to borrow it instead of buying it."
1,The worst of the bunch,"I can't believe I read the whole thing!. What a bore, when we got to what I thought would be exciting (the border crossing, or the kill attempt), each was about one page long. The pontification about the Catholic religion was misplaced. And to hear the hero Ryan whining endlessly about being away from home for a few nights, please!"
2,Did he get paid by the word?,"Unfortunately, this wordy,ponderous,repetitious tree waster is no where near the quality I have come to know and love from Clancy. Clearly, he has done some terrific work , such as Red Storm Rising, Executive Orders, Bear & Dragon,etc. While a game attempt at some real history, Red Rabbit has none of the usual suspense and complexity I expect from this writer. Hey Tom, next time, when you are 1/2 way through it, and it doesn't look good, just trash it, and come up with something we can all be proud of."
3,Did I read the same book...?,"I must have picked up the wrong book at the store. They must be selling two different ""Red Rabbit"" books by Tom Clancy.While I'll agree it's not the best Clancy book I've read, it was a good read, and a quick read. I stumbled through Debt of Honor on and off for several months, but I finished Red Rabbit in under a week. I also thought The Bear and the Dragon was better than most reviewers, it seems, though.The one thing about this book was that it told a fictionalization of true events (somewhat, at least). I've not read many novels that fit into that category and pulled it off as well as Clancy did with Red Rabbit.Now, having said that, there were parts of the book that I felt could have been left out - about 50 pages or so toward the end (around page 500 or so). Also, I'll readily admit that I enjoyed Rainbow Six more than Red Rabbit - but Rainbow Six isn't Ryanverse."
5,Splitting the Iron Curtain,"This novel told me volumes of what I have always suspected life might have been like to live in Russia. Not only is the story about one of my favorite charachters, ""Jack Ryan"", but it give me a better insight into where he is coming from. If your looking for a book to grip you from the beginning, this is the one. It gives you a sense of being there and to identify with the charachters of this book. All of the charachters on both sides of the ""old iron curtain"" are so very 'real'. This is my first 'Tom Clancy' book, but it will not be my last. Probably should have read ""Patriot Games"" first, since they refer to incidents from that book. (saw the movie, so I am familar with the lead charachters) Actuall saw several of the movies, and now look forward to reading those books too. ""Hunt for Red October"", ""clear and Present Danger"". If there are other 'Clancy' fans out there I would like to hear from you and any reccomendations you might have."
1,If you suffer from insomnia...,"I have to say, when I saw the book, my hand went to my wallet. Now I wish I had read some reviews first. Very tedious, Mr. Clancy as usual, spends way to much time on detail after detail,instead of getting to the action. Of course in this book there is no action. Each time I picked it up, I was drifting off to sleep by the fifth page. Hey Tom, stop pontificating on your politics in your character's thoughts. Better yet, get new characters, instead of Mr. Clean Marine, who says ""love ya babe"" every third page! Gentle reader, do yourself a favor, and skip this one, or if you must, borrow it from the library."
1,Why Did You Write This?!?,"I buy your books, Tom, because of the largeness of scope, and plot complications, and close calls, and snazzy spyworks, and worldwide intrigue, and tens of thousands of lives on the line. But ""Red Rabbit"" felt small and plodding and there weren't any plot twists and nothing really ever went wrong. And where was the payoff? When I finished it, I just went, ""So?""There's a reason I buy your books, and this wasn't it."
1,RED RABBIT DOESN'T HOP,"I quite enjoyed Clancy's previous books and I will no doubt purchase the next one, but I would not recommend Red Rabbit to anyone. First off, Clancy has Jack Ryan talking like a foul mouthed hippie and it is very much out of character for Ryan. Most disappointing, though, is that there is NO suspense. Everything the Americans and Brits plan comes through without a hitch and the Russians are depicted as, if not stupid, then certainly quite naive. Rabbit's wife hardly questions his defection! A very poor effort from Clancy. Seems almost as though this book was written to meet a publisher's deadline rather than to entertain readers."
1,Shameless laughing stock,"This is the most disappointing work of any author I've read in years. Red Rabbit is an almost complete dedication to the shameless jingoistic bashing of everything Soviet, right down to the physical makeup of the Slavic man and woman. Not only is this work poorly researched (assassination attempt is incorrectly set in plot timing, assuming there's allusion to real-life incidents), it's thoroughly shallow in its depiction of character. Even Ryan, perhaps the least caustic character in the novel has uncharacteristically ugly words. The sign-language Idiots, Inc. spy team of Ed/Mary is completely ridiculous, but that's not wholly surprising as I've never been impressed with the covert worlds in Clancy's literature. There's really only one fiction spymaster - John le Carre.What happened, Mr. Clancy? Where's the wit, the drama and the maturity we saw in your other works, such as the Red October and Rainbow Six? I'm disappointed. And disgusted. What a waste of time, pen and paper."
1,Clancy mailed it in,If this was the first jack Ryan book it would have been the last. Perhaps it was ghost written by the OP Center scribes
1,weakest Clancy novel to date,"""Red Rabbit"" may be the last Clancy novel that this former fan ever reads. When I picked up the book, I expected the usual attention to detail, but this is simply excruciating. People talk. They decide to send a message. Somebody encrypts the message. The message is sent. The message is received. Somebody else decrypts the message. The message is delivered. Other people talk. Repeat every 40 pages. Arrgh!This book would be very difficult to enjoy, even for the most enthusiastic Clancy fan. Casual readers of Clancy have no chance.Skip it and read ""Red October"" again."
1,Needed to Fulfill Contract,Tom must have owed the publisher another book by a certain time. I'm a big fan but this was a joke. Read the other reviews. It's not worth it for me to repeat what this book was NOT.
2,Did Clancy have a headache???,"I certainly thought I'd never finish the novel! There is sooo much repetition. I got tired of rehashing the previous novel with the attack on his house...Sum of All Fears, I believe. I got tired of his smoking and thinking how Cathy would disapprove. Clancy seemed to have a bad headache when he wrote this. Yak, yak, yak by the characters. This one is a BIG disappointment!!!"
2,Will the Real Tom Clancy Please Stand Up,"Will the real Tom Clancy please stand up? I couldn't find him in this book. No high-tech weaponry, no complex plot (was there a plot at all?), no suspense, and no surprises. In this book Jack Ryan goes on European holiday, or may as well have. The story is so predictable that it is not predictable. You never expect a Clancy story to go so smoothly for the characters. There are always snags and plot-twists. I kept waiting for something to go wrong in Operation BEATRIX but the ""other shoe"" never falls. It's a text-book spy operation, almost boring. They all live happily ever after. The End."
1,Save your time and save your money.,"I saw Tom Clancy on The Jay Leno Show peddling this turkey,he said this book was harder to write than any book he had written in the past. He said the reason was he was had just stopped smoking. Well in my humble opinion he should either stop writng or start smoking again. Tom you should be ashamed to put your name on this."
1,Very Slow Reading,"Tom Clancy is following in the steps of Stephen King. Just because one writes more verse, it does not mean there is quality there. This book rambles on about one of Clancys favorite subjects ""the Catholic Church"" But there is little bite to the plot, especially since you know how things will turn out. Entirely droll and predictable."
2,"Feel Free to Skip this Ryanverse Novel, You Won't Miss Anything","This is an average thrown together Clancy novel. Does not focus on Jack Ryan, he is more of a bumbling ancillary character. If you skip this you will miss almost nothing in the Ryanverse. I read the book 4 years ago, so I do not remember the particulars , just that I was unimpressed."
2,Decline and Fall,"Although a Clancy from his first book, ""Hunt For Red October,"" I've found the quality of his writing has begun to decline in the last two or three novels. And this is especially true of ""Red Rabbit."" I almost feel that rather than write a novel for the entertainment of his readers, he's now writing to primarily express his own personal ideologies. This is, at best, a mediocre 250 page story that Clancy has managed to drag out through more than 500 pages."
4,"Great read, but a few times flawed by the excesses of fiction","Red Rabbit entertainingly unravels the life of a defector, but throughout you get the feeling that some parts are ""too easy"", and therefore do not mirror the true dangers and intrigues of espionage. Nonetheless, Clancy does a marvelous job of continuing his inspirational accounts of the Ryan Universe, and any fan of the series should seriously give this one a look. There is one scene in this book, (the hotel one) that is simply superb and unforgettable. Positively recommended."
3,Nostalgia,A revisit to the days of yester-year back when there was a worthy adversary to the world's premier superpower. This is a decent read but nothing like his earlier Jack Ryan books. It is hard to go back and write a book set chronologically between your other books.
3,Not as bad as I thought,"Although I'm familiar with the character of Jack Ryan through the cinema this is my first Clancy novel. Due to this books poor reviews I thought it would be a good place to start.As Jack Ryan is not the center of my literary universe, the fact that he is not the cental figure here does not bother me. As I began to read I expected the worst but I found myself enjoying this book more than I thought I would. The end was a bit of a disappointment, seemed a bit rushed and didn't tie up some of the loose ends like I would of liked. Where does the Rabbit and his family actually end up in the US anyway?I did enjoy the cat and mouse game with the Foley's in Moscow and really enjoyed the days in Budapest leading up to the actual defection. Plodding, a but slow but it still held my interest.I'll read more of Clancy and this is probably not his best work but it's not the worst book I've read either."
2,Off the mark,"I don't have a lot to say about this book except that it is boring and confusing. Clancy gets so caught up in his minute details that he forgets to actually write a story. Early Clancy is far superior to this read. The only reason I'm finishing it, is because I started it."
3,Not the best,"This really wasn't all that great. I've heard some complaints about the length of the book, but the problem seems to be more that he isn't saying much and taking a long time to do it. C'mon...200 pages so that we can find out the the Soviets want to kill the Pope. He needs an editor.Plus, this book kind of has two parts. I won't ruin it for anyone except to say that the book seemed to reach some kind of a conclusion ~100 pages from the end. Then rushes like mad to get ""part 2"" finished."
1,Red Roost,"Wow, the intensity, the techo thriller and the interesting plot are gone. I found this a bit to boring and predictable. Although interesting, it could have been told in 50 pages or less. I do not think I can handle another Clancy book, and I used to be a big fan. The creative juices from Clancy are gone like a burnt out rock star. Time for him to retire and read other's great novels."
1,Page Filler,"I've read all of Clancy's books, while most I find it takes a while to get into the story but generally once it has picked up it was a very good read. Red Rabbit on the other hand, Clancy must have been tired, this book could have been a short story, I felt that he could have done it with 200 pages. Very disappointed and will really check before buying another."
1,Not worth the 97 cents,At the time I write this review Red Rabbit is being offered for 97 cents for a used copy.Please believe me - it isn't worth it
2,Waste of time and money,"This book, like one reviewer has already stated, MUST have been written to fill a contract. It was a waste of my time & $$.I have all of Tom Clancy's other books, but this one I sold after reading...."
1,Invest Your Time Elsewhere,"Clancy, like Ludlum and Grisham has seemingly run out of stories to tell. In 600 pages Clancy, in Red Rabbit, provides details about the spy business and more characters than is comprehensible without providing any reason for the reader to continue turning the pages except that many of his previous books have been page turners. The story is trite and the ending is disappointing. When the reader finally gets to the final page he is left with the question, why did I read all of this? For me, it is time to find a new author with fresh ideas. Tom Clancy's formula does not work anymore."
2,Very Slow Read,"Tom Clancy's books usually are written so well that you hate to set down his books. Not only did I set ""Red Rabbit"" down several times, but I left it sitting on my desk for a month without ever feeling that I was missing something.The majority of the book is used to set the plot and introduce you to all of the characters. The final few chapters are used to bring the storyline to a conclusion. There is little action and, when there is something happening, it concludes too quickly and too easily.The story reads like something that would happen in real life with few surprises. This is definitely NOT a book to escape from reallity into a world of intrigue and fun. For that you will have to check out Tom's other books...."
1,Plodding and Predictable,"It's difficult to create tension when you backdate your story and focus on an assassination everyone already knows failed. But it is possible. Clancy did not do so here. Everything surrounding the plot is predictable, and there is virtually no tension in the storyline. This could have been made a much better book. Clancy focussed on the efforts to get a defector and his family out, which leaves ample room for tension, but then he made the operation utterly without danger, and we were told this frequently while the operation was going on. There was no suspicious KGB type hot on their heels, so to speak, no shootouts at midnight, no running through darekened streets, no action, in fact, of any kind. And then, at the end, what is our reward? The Pope gets shot anyway, of course, so where is the victory? If you were disappointed, as I was, with Rainbow Six, well, this one is much worse than that, and would probably never have been published if Clancy's name hadn't been attached."
1,Tech-Non-Thriller,"Tom Clancy's decline has found a new bottom in this book. Hopefully his craft turns around.The essence of a thriller is uncertainty and surprise. Alas, there is none in Red Rabbit. Nothing goes wrong; nothing comes as a surprise. Hence, there is no drama. There is just 618 pages of description - and we all know how wooden Tom Clancy's description can be.Here's hoping Clancy finds something more interesting to write about."
2,"Interesting, but not up to the Clancy bar","I am also a big fan of Clancy's work. Particularly his later books (Executive Order, Debt of Honor, Without Remorse). The only similarity of this novel with those is the names of a few characters.This book is not what any Clancy fan would expect. If the names were changed and the book was 200 pages shorter and written under another pen name or something, it might be a good read. But for Clancy fans that enjoy the normal time investment that his technical and long novels take, this one doesn't have the ""Return on Investment"""
2,"OK, Who REALLY wrote this book?","Slow is an understatement for this novel.If it didn't have Clancy's name on the cover I would never have believed it was his work.Because I already knew the outcome of the book from history, I expected the story to have more intrigue.Well, the intrigue was there, but it was spread thin through a lot of filler. Normally, I have difficulty putting a Clancy novel down. Not with this book. Don't try to read this one when you're tired or you will be asleep in short order. It does not require a lot analysis to follow the story.This Clancy novel has far more profanity than his previous works. Many will not find it objectionable, but it was more than I prefer and detracted from the story.This is the second Clancy book that I wish I had waited for the paperbook to purchase. I think I won't buy his next in hardback until I have reviewed a library copy."
2,Can't Seem To Finish This One,"I've read them all and this has been a lousy read so far. I'm half way into it and struggling. I'm a big Clancy fan and usually buy his autographed books after waiting in line to see him. Not this time though. He has started his book tour for years in New London, CT at the Paperback Booksmith due to it's proximity to the Submarine Capitol of the World. Well ... the Booksmith shutdown after his previous release and this must have changed his luck."
2,Red Rabbit Hops.....Slowly,"Tame plot, not much action. More of a sermon on religion than an adventure story."
2,Not his best...,"It was an ok read but I kept waiting for something to happen, it all went too smoothly. No real intrigue."
3,My least favorite Jack Ryan,"This is one of the earlier books in the Jack Ryan enterprise. It starts off pretty slow and does not really take off like many of the others. Jack and Cathy Ryan have just moved to London with Sally and Jack Jr. The Foleys, Ed, Pat and Little Ed, have just started in Moscow. The Russians are crazy as ever and want to kill the Pope. A Russian communications expert gets a case of morals and wants to try and save the Pope. I should not say much more, or I will ruin the best part. I have read many Clancy's and this would not be in my top 5 but it does put a few things together so I am glad that I read it. I guess I would give it a C+."
1,Strike 2,"It is a shame no stars is not an option for rating. It would appear Clancy was attempting to write the screenplay of another Jack Ryan movie with this work.With the high tension that was rampant between NATO and the Warsaw Pact during this time period, there was plenty of background to place many of the characters from his other books. And I had to laugh at Clancy's buildup of Ed Foley and the New York Times reporter, yet there was no further mention of this later in Foley's career. The NYT would have never lived down a sleeper CIA agent on their reporter staff.Instead, we get a plodding story that is lacking virtually everything Clancy had become well known for....and it only gets worse with the TEETH OF THE TIGER."
2,Boring...,"Tom Clancy really missed this one. The story within the 900 pages (Penguin pocket book edition) could be easily told in at least half of that. The large paragraphs with descriptions and characters thought add nothing to the plot and are passed through.Jack Ryan is a merely spectator. The guy in the right place at the right time.Where is the suspense? And all the hard decision making in the intelligence business? Who cares about the differences between american and british ophtamologists?I'll tell a small detail of the story now...the ""hard part"" of the defection, make the soviets believe that the Rabbits are dead, is easily solved with ""convenient"" fires in the US and Britain. That's awful writing."
2,Red Rabbit,"I have read most of Tom Clancy's novels and for some reason found this one to be one of the most boring of all of them. While Clancy can still put scenes together and craft some excellent dialogues, the suspense and intrigue wee old hat stuff. Pick it up Tom!"
1,"Review of ""Red Rabbit"" by Tom Clancy",This is probably the worst Tom Clancy book I have read. It is heavily padded and is probably three times as long as the simplistic plot deserves. I'm sorry I spent the money on buying it. A great disappointment.
3,entertaining but no knockout,"For Clancy fans, this is a very good book and another good story. It would probably get four stars from me but I have had trouble finishing it, and therefore it got bumped down to three. If you've got some free time, go for it. It is a good book. If you don't, you may prioritize this thing down to the bottom of your list."
2,When is something going to happen,I love Clancy but this book is a bore. Almost nothing happens. Skip this in favor of one of his older books you'll be happier
2,This is Clancy ?,"A disappointing book. One wonders whether Mr. Clancy used a substitute writer for this mediocre thriller. Compared with his earlier books which were terrific, Red Rabbit seems to have been written as an afterthought."
5,Fine Book,This book does a great job in analyzing the traits of the great wealth creators. I've read several books on this topic and most of them are very unfocused and biographical instead of focusing on the traits (not the person) and making an argument on why they are important. The book is very well-written and focused and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in what makes these successful people tick.
4,bygone era,This is a second mystery by Ms.Peale set in late XIX century Boston. She is masterful in describing the rigid class system of the Brahman elite and its tight hold on the pulse of the city. Her characters are well developed and seem alive. The only problem are her puzzles. They are not very complex and guessing a murderer doesn't pose a problem. Nevertheless I enjoyed reading this book and I rate it 3 1/2 stars.
4,One disapointment,"Enjoyed the book. Bought it for my mother who had me read it in the 50's because it reminded her of growing up in Chicago. Enjoyed it then and again now but was disapointed in the clumsy editing of my copy. For $40. I did not expect that pages would be missing and others run out of place. Example page 196 runs after page 191 and again in proper place after 195, there is no page 192. Then page 244 runs after page 215. There is no page 216. Would expect this with a cheap copy but not from Amazon. Other than that it is an enjoyable book."
1,NOT A Region 1 DVD !,The item here is listed as a region 1 DVD (USA and Canada). This is NOT true.This is a PAL DVD ! I just got mine and it will not play in my player.Thanks for screwing me over Amazon!
3,Not bad but his other book was much better,"""Dropping Ashes on the Buddha"" was a much better book in my opinion and explained his teachings better. Still, the book is not bad and was fun to read"
5,Not a Toy Implementation,"I bought this book with the expectation that the Bluebox message server would be a token implementation.Whoa! Was I wrong; this book shows the full monty! It includes a message server engine, a log server, a database interface, a license server, and auto update engine, recovery facilities, and a heartbeat monitor. Fortunately, the 100 or so classes that make up the distribution are well documented and a user manual is included in the book. The last few sections of the book also have some interesting anecdotes that are worth reading."
2,A Bad Taste in my Mouth.,"This show is rock bottom. ""Sunset"" should have made a good musical, but this???????The cast does a very mediocre performance.Hearn is really the best vocal performance on this CD. Close is a fair performer, but is not Tony quality. Campbell does a horrible version of Joe. Then there is the music. Once you you hear a melody, you are going to hear it again, and again, and again. ALW could have at least made original music for the car chase scene! Then the lyrics. In ""The lady's paying"" you hear joe say ""Golly Gee"" out of nowhere. That is totally out of character, and out of the blue. The two decent songs, ""As if we never said goodbye"", and ""With One Look"", are best heard on the Striesand album, ""Barbra, back to Broadway"". Avoid this and go directly to the ""Sunday in the Park with George"" Page."
1,sunset BORE - levard,"I've never been a big fan of Lloyd-Weber,so it was with some hesitancy that I approached this album,and my opinion that all his shows are gimmick driven(the staircase in this, the falling chandelier of ""Phantom"") was more than justified.From the ludicrous opening- "" sunset BOUL- evard, something BOUL-evard"",to the limp ending,I found this overblown and un-involving.Even the old L.P. I have of a proposed musical starring the original ""Norma"", Gloria Swanson, was better.In fact,I was so disappointed with this, I couldn't wait to give it away.And who told Glenn Close she could sing ?.After listening to this,I had to make sure it wasn't just me,so I listened to ""Les Mis"",Sondheims' ""Passion"", and even Andersson & Ulvaeus' ""Kristina fran Duvemala"" in Swedish,and found them all eminently more involving emotionally.Even a second listening did nothing to improve my original opinion."
2,Deeply flawed,"Everyone in New York seems to hate Mr. Webber, and this show is always on their list of excuses. I will admit that a lot of the music is exeptionally average, but he main problem is the lyrics. I could give you a lundry list of problems with the lyrics, but that would be tedious to say the least. Just trust me when I say they're bad. They are so bad that they ruin the CD, which has so much talent in it it should be hailed as a modern classic. Webber is definatly at fault for a the cheesey music, but I have a feeling the music would seem less cheesey with lyrics that don't absolutly reek of limburger. Don't but this is you have any taste in music or if you have any respect for the English as an art for."
2,Don't buy this deluxe edition -- buy the US release,"I recently bought this deluxe edition thinking that the audio quality would be better than the regular US release since it has been 'remastered'. When I listened to it, I could hear some noise specially in silent moments (such as in conversations). When I listened to my highlights CD (US release), the audio quality was much, much better. So, I suggest that this 'deluxe edition' not be considered if you're thinking of buying the original American cast recording of Sunset Boulevard. Better stick with the regular US release."
5,BABY AIN'T THAT THE GREATEST!!! GLENN ( AESOME ),"WOW!! YEAH!! The altimate Norma Desmond is performed by Glenn ( man whatta voice ) Close!!! I have seen this play performed 12 times by different people and man Glenn puts 'em all to shame!! She is so amazing!! Glenn Close proves that hollywood really does have talent (sorry LEO)ha, ha. Well HAVEN'T YOU GOTTEN IT INTO YOUR HEAD YET THE IT NOW!! Come on its SUNSET BOULEVARD ruthless boulevard and its great, superb, fantastic, amazing, and wow oh baby wow!!!!"
5,One of my top favorites of ALW,"I admit when I first got into Alw I relaly didn't expand beyond Pahntom and Joseph, but when I got the Now and Forever disc set that all changed. When I heard the selectiosn from Sunset I ahd knew right hen and there I needed to get sunset. So, i did and i'm loving it.I love Glenn CLose as norma becuase she is waht norma Desmond is. i liek the rest of the cast too, but the one thing that sticks out is the music.The overture to Sunset, as always with ALW, is very haunting and mystical , and gets the lsitener into the plot. After the overture, With One Look, Too Much in Love to Care, Sunset Boulevard, and New WAys to Dream really hit the spot. I think this version of sunset is so much better thatn the london cast. This is a very good buy."
2,Get the London Cast Instead,"Glenn Close is indeed a brilliant actress, and she can sing well enough to have pulled off the vocals for the Lion King, but a Broadway musical? Her voice is too weak and lacks the range for these songs. While her performance on stage might have made up for the weakness of her vocal performance, a soundtrack is an entirely different matter."
1,Andrew Lloyd Webber does it again,"Well, this is typical Andrew Lloyd Webber. He has a good melody or two in here, but he uses the same melody over, and over, and over, and over again. BORING !! The lyrics are dreadful. The performances range from good (George Hearn), to OK (Glenn Close), to absolutely awful (everyone else)."
2,"""Sunset"" Overdone","So, the producers felt the Broadway audience would much rather see Glenn Close as Norma Desmond than Patti LuPone. Though I disagree, they were probably right - the advance box office sales alone were amazing. Alas, big box office from a big star does not necessarily translate into a great soundtrack. Close is simply not a singer. As she over-does her Norma Desmond - losing any sense of vulnerability and fragility associated with the character- she turns Norma into a frightening stage clown. As she sings(?)/acts on the soundtrack, one can not help but notice her eyes focused on the Tony Award, and not the character itself. Certainly not to be out-done we have Allan Campbell out-diva-ing the diva herself, turning the character of Joe into a bloodless monster. For those who saw the play with Close in the lead (either LA or NY) this is probably an unforgettable souvenir from the show. For everyone else: it's a huge mistake."
5,ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!,This is an absolutely amazing song - I am simply blown away! It is rich and complex...but yet catchy. Madness are not just BACK....they are BETTER THAN EVER!!
4,SignLanguage,"Mortensen again choses to illustrate intentionally provocative ""capture the moment"" photos in his work SignLanguage. The layered multimedia works in this book reflect the increasing depth of this author's life experiences and are among the best pieces in the work. The stylistic underpinnings of his more recent work, Miyelo, are evident in the portraits of this book -- he has a gift for grasping emotion with his focus on a subject's eyes. A good work, but not his best."
5,Gerber Replacement Stems For Shower,"The Danco stems replaced Gerber stems that were around 26 years old, so I had reservation that theywould fit. They fit just like the old ones and even came with replacment seats. Fortunately, myseats had been replaced previously, so I can save these for another time. The Danco stems seem tobe of good quality and worked just great."
1,NO Charcoal! just a paper filter save your money,"I bought on price and of course name, a Purolator cabin filter for my Ford Focus , i was shocked to find in the nice box no electro-statically charged media layers with a layer of Activated charcoal sandwiched in between. oh boy! Just a Plane jane Paper filter nothing fancy at all. I bought a paper and charcoal filter at the local auto parts for the same money! Purolator makes a nice package and what a pile of malarky they feed usnot worth sending back only i will not be fooled again"
1,Disappointed,"Like most parents and grandparents who are releated to an autistic child, I had hoped to find something useful in this DVD but really found nothing. Due to the short length and lack of content, I'll be nice and stop just short of saying it's a rip off. Don't bother buying this one."
5,good dvd,But confusing which I guess is the whole thing to this video to show you how confusing autisim is. This is a good companion to the book 10 things the autisic child wishes you knew
3,Waterbells,"We are moderately happy with the 4"" bells. They were quite a challenge to use at first, but I am stronger for the effort. The ad was a bit confusing. I was under the impression that I was buying a set of 3 graduated sized dumbbells (I received only the largest size). The bells are used daily, and after 4 weeks the thin layers of foam are beginning to separate."
4,My daughter loves it!,"I purchased this chair about a month ago. My daughter loves it. She sits in it every morning with her dry cereal and milk - and her feet up on the ottoman. Both the chair and ottoman are very sturdy and well made. The chair is very stable and does not rock so easily that there is concern of it tipping too far back or forward. The only complaint I have is it looks great from the front, but unfinished from the back, as it has exposed staples that attach the ""leather"" to the back of the chair. At this price, I would think the back would be just as finished as an adult upholstered chair."
4,MANY FACES OF AN ANGEL,"Zoe Parry, a survivor of ritual and sexual abuse suffered from Multiple Personality Disorder/Dissociative Identity Disorder (MPD/DID). She developed over 100 personalities and most of them were opposites. Many of her personalities were extensions of her ""good"" qualities, henceforth, angels. She had a legion of ""demonic"" personalities who thrived in cultist environments and one personality was a coven witch.Zoe suffered with brushes with the law due to her DID. On February 3, 1978 she was jailed and subsequently hospitalized after she kidnapped a girl she baby sat for. From 1978 to the early 1990s, Zoe's life is a litany of therapeutic treatments and literally piecing herself back together."
3,Good but mmm,"I have a lot of this branch instruments pencils so I was wonder, what about fountain pens works,It was quite small that I had thing on mind, Dont feel ok due his oblique angles both sides,The ink does not work ok if you leave it without work for so many days.But still believe that it have a good looking, overall,the point is ok.but should be more appropriated for a Lady.sorry."
2,Georgette Heyer deserves a better biographer,"I recently found this in my basement and re-read it. I was almost immediately reminded why it was in my basement. Setting aside that it's quite skimpy on the ""biography,"" Ms. Hodge didn't do even basic research. There are several egregious errors, e.g. a paragraph where she mentions that the heroine of *Pastel* is jealous of her ""elder"" sister. This is not a forgivable lapse, as another reviewer would have it; this is a slap in the face when writing about an author whose books were so meticulously and lovingly researched.Ms. Hodge seems to have had either too little or too much affection for Ms. Heyer and I think it shows. The biography is lavishly illustrated and she mentions each of Heyer's works by name, but the rest of it is oddly lacking, and overall disappointing. Far better to curl up with a good Heyer book than to waste your time with this."
3,The Queen of Regencies wasn't nobility,"This is worth reading, not so much because Heyer led an interesting life (she didn't), but because it gives so much insight into her opinions of her own work, the research she did, and the reasons behind many of her decisions, such as her refusal to grant interviews or do publicity. It may come as a surprise to her fans to learn that she held much of her writing in contempt and regarded historical fiction as her true calling."
2,A bizarre Mix,"The historical presentation in this documentary is quite good. What is strange is the mixing of 18th century history with modern day images.For example, after explaining about Dorchester Heights and its role in the seige of Boston, they show a kid throwing a tennis ball against the monument on D. Heights. WHAT? Everything is presented from the British point of view, which is OK, but I have a few issues with that. They insist on calling it a ""Civil War"" which I'm not completely convinced the term is appropriate. Also, there are many innane references to the Vietnam War. The interviewing of people on the bus about the history is funny and seems SO out of place for the seriousness of the film.After watching 3 of the 4 episodes, I won't be finishing it. I've seen enough.In so many ways, this documentary just misses the mark."
3,The French did win the battle of Yorktown,"Despite the previous reviewer's statement, the British attempted to surrender to the French at Yorktown for two good reasons - 1.) the battle was largely won by the French (French naval blockade and Rochambeau's sizable troop and seige material contribution) and 2.) it was part of the larger war between the French and British at the time.Since the French suffered twice the deaths and provided the major effort for the siege, it would only be natural to call this a French victory - or at least a joint Franco-American victory. But in the revisionist view of American history, this French contribution must be downplayed.""Freedom Fries"" anyone?"
1,Even the title turns me off,"This definitely has a British slant and mostly sides with the British....the title itself says it all....""Rebels and Redcoats""......Rebels meaning criminals, non-conformist and trouble makers while Redcoats meaning ""brave British army""...."
1,Biased nonsense,"I saw this program on Public Television, and was struck by its absurdity.The program goes out of its way to detail American acts of violence and atrocities, and ignores, simplifies, or denies equivalent British acts. The entire revolution is redifined as a civil war, one instigated by greedy merchantmen with a lust for bloodshed. Particulary entertaining for me was the statement that the rebels where equivalents of the Viet Cong and the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan. I should like to think that any responsible documentartian would be able to understand the difference between George Washington and Osama bin Laden. Unfortunately, the documentary (using the Michael Moore definition of the word) labels the Americans as, and I quote, ""militants"". The same word the media uses to describe those individuals in the Middle East prone to destroying coffee houses full of Jewish children.Avoid this at all costs.Unless you're in the mood to laugh."
4,ridaz,the only reason i gave this record 4 mics is because i love pmp these guys rule its only a matter of time before they crash the industry like n.w.a did in 89 their first album was off the hook i dont understand why it wasnt promoted better but me and mine ent. isnt doing anything for their careers i cant wait for their next release playa-tite ridaz
2,"Tweaky, noisey","This is an OK first amp for your blossoming metalhead, but it wasn't what I wanted. The problem is that none of the amp models are really clean, and don't sound true. Running other effects into this amp results in disaster. It does have a nice noise reduction circuit, and it's needed.A design flaw is that they placed the power cord jack (back) exactly where the unit would rest on most stands available on the market for this size amp. So, you end up chopping the stand or forgoeing it altogether. That was kinda stupid, don't you think?"
4,Trancey and disturbing world fusion,"I haven't been able to find out much re this ensemble, who apparently are Belgian, but I can recommend this CD to anyone who loves contemporary elaborations on Middle Eastern music. Think of early Popol Vuh or Agitation Free (German bands midway between New Age and rock) and you'll have some idea ... Raksha Mancham uses samples of Arab speech and song over which they play North African instruments together with synthesizer and electric bass. The mood is haunting and quite dark throughout. A few tracks have a political message re struggles for freedom of ethnic minorities. This CD may not be completely representative of Raksha Mancham (it seems thay have earlier recordings influenced by Tibetan music) but it is well worth a listen."
2,"It's OK, but wasn't worth the price","I bought this for my son's 4th birthday; he had asked specifically for Packer & it was hard to find anywhere else. It doesn't take standard batteries & the battery died almost immediately. It's a little tough to put the ""oranges"" top onto the crate so it will stay (empty inside). It is a LOT smaller than I anticipated....probably my fault for not looking at the dimensions. It was overpriced, for sure. My son plays with it once in a while, but not often, so it was a waste of money, really."
1,this is NOT the naked music group--avoid like the plague!,"So you thought this was the newest single by Blue 6, the cool & funky group on the Naked Music label with Jay Denes at the helm? Oh, you are so wrong. At least I was. This release is really some crap Eurodance song that has the annoying quality of a jackhammer. Learn from my mistake and DO NOT buy this CD! Track down the Music & Wine and Sweeter Love singles instead, if you haven't already."
3,pretty good book for beginners,"I rated this book 3 stars mainly because I am already an experienced user in UNIX systems.I use this book mainly because it covers some basic about Unix System Programming.This book covers an overview of Linux including commands, shell scripts and system calls [...]"
1,wrongly categorized!,"While searching for books about ulcerative colitis, this title popped up on the search results list ... this is a computer book and has no relevance to ulcerative colitis!"
1,6 Months and the LCD Screen Stopped working,"Bought this portable Audiovox DVD player/tv in December of 2004 from Amazon.com. Was working pretty well. Did not really use it much (had it in my toddler's room). Used it in the car just a couple of times. Then last week, the monitor stopped working. Not sure why. Will try to see if Audiovox will repair it under warranty, but I will still have to pay for shipping."
1,Too Good to be True,"With the combination of screen size, features and price, I should have suspected that this product was too good to be true. To date, I have returned two of these players to the store where I purchased them. The first played one DVD, then quit playing altogether. The second one played DVDs fine, but produced sound from only the right side, whether using the built in speakers or the headphones. I will stick with Sony or Panasonic from here on out...Audiovox is not ready for prime time."
2,D1210 So-So,"I purchased this primarily because I wanted a replacement TV for the kitchen that fits under the counter. There are few flat screen TV's available that will fit within the 11 inch clearance under my kitchen wall cabinet. Although this was overpriced, I thought I preferred it over the hang-under-the-counter models that had much smaller screens.My main complaint is that unless you are viewing the picture from directly in front of the TV, the picture is pretty bad. That includes both side-to-side and vertical off-center displacement. My wife was very unhappy with the results, because she moves around lots when in the kitchen. As a result, my old TV is back in the kitchen and the D1210 sits in its fancy bag in the closet waiting for a more appropriate use."
1,Does not work!!,"I bought this over 1 year ago, used it for less than 40 hours and now it will not read DVD's. Also, just before it died, I hooked it up to a TV monitor for the first time, and the picture faded in and out for the entire length of the movie. This was consitant with other DVD's. I called Audiovox for help and they want to charge me $172 to have it repaired because it is past the warranty deadline. I offered them a compromise and they were not helpful. I recommend you continue to shop!! I will never buy an Audiovox product again!"
1,Only buy this if you have money to throw away!!,I bought this in December and after playing 2 videos it overheated and just showed colors on the screen. If you have even a tiny scratch on your DVD it wont play it. We only use it on long trips so it has not been used that much and now it wont even load the DVD at all. I called custumer service and without the reciept my warantee is no good and it will cost $180 plus shipping to fix. I even read the bad reviews and thought mine would be different!! HAHAHA. It will be my next yard sale item.
5,Great for Trips,"This has truely been a godsend on long trips to the grandparents house. It gets hot, ut you just have to let it cool down. We have had this model for over 3 years now and love it."
5,classic and excellent,"This is an excellent general fitness guidebook. It focuses on general strength training and aerobic fitness over a lifetime. The calisthenic exercises are presented clearly, as are the justification for the exercise. There are many good guidelines for maintaining fitness from an early age into late middle age. The calisthenic and weight programs listed at the end of the book are comprehensive and thorough, as you would expect from our military academies.This is a great book for general fitness. It covers weight training sufficiently, but it is not a body building guide."
5,frescura total,"Siempre es agradable escuchar estas grabaciones de musica antigua, tocadas como musica antigua.El interprete est√° genial en trasmitir la frescura y vivacidad de la obra de Sanz. Muchas de estas obras han sido tan escuchadas en guitarra moderna (incorporando los razonables y necesarios ajustes, adaptaciones y arreglos), que uno a veces pierde la perspectiva y agradece volver a escuchar las versiones originales."
5,Brilliant and wise.,"Roger Sessions had a reputation as a ""difficult"" composer, branded as an elitist, atonalist, and worse, an ""intellectual"" composer with no room for emotion in music. The essays, however, tell a slightly different story. His is an essentially Romantic nature, one which vibrates to what he called the ""imponderables"" of music and who had little use for analysis after the fact, except as a technical help for composers. Among the essays, you will find gems on where the power of music lies (perhaps the best speculation on this topic I've read), the current state of the musical public, a massive dose of common sense in the new vs. traditional music debates, portraits of five composers, all from a deeply cultured and incisive mind. I think even people who dislike Sessions's music will find much to admire in this collection. It may, ideally, lead people to Sessions's music itself."
3,good replacement for '04 Mini,"Some klutz in the midwest misplaced my oil filler cap.I needed a replacement immediately but could NOT find one on the road.So, I took emergency measures (don't ask!) and ordered the Stant unit to be waiting for me when I got back to town.Fits Ok - doesn't feel like quality stuff - but works fine."
5,Excellent read,"In A Question of Power, Bessie Head makes a deep exploration into the life of a woman in her world which is governed by every day efforts of the characters to exercise control or have an edge over those they are dealing with. Brilliantly written, this fast moving and deep novel is a recommended book for someone interested in women in this politically liberal part of Africa.I see echoes of other African stories like The Oaf, The Usurper and Others.This is an intuitively observed story with a fascinating plot and great narrative and dialogue."
3,Sad Story,"This story of three Americans being kidnapped brings to the forefront the dangers of people near the Columbian border. What a tragic ending, where the Americans were never found and the men who did the deed were never prosecuted. Such a sacrifice for people to give their lives for bringing the message of Jesus to a remote Indian tribe, the Kuna. The book is not written in a very compelling or spell binding way as you would expect but is a review of the facts around the kidnapping. Certainly saddens the reader that people who are so kind would be taken from their families and beheaded later. A great loss for mankind when people this dedicated are hurt despite their work. There are many missionairies who give their lives to help others and I was inspired by the story."
4,wonderful,This is a heartbreaking tail full of ups and downs. I learned exactly how much I have to be thankful for and how to trust in God even in your darkest hour.
1,vitaminlife sucks!!,I didnt order this item .. I came across it while doin a search .. based on previous experience with this supplier .. most probably u wont get it b4 it's expiry date .. cheers all .. and shame on u vitaminlife
4,My allergies LOVE this.,"I have two sheading dogs and I'm allergic to dust. Roomba has changes my life. The dog hair doesn't bother me, but the dust that accumulates in the dog hair kills me. Now, I run Roomba everyday in the rooms I'm in most and my allegeries are under control. There are lots of Roomba models and I don't know if I got the best model for dog hair. I do have to clean out the hair pretty regularly (a dust mask makes this a very do-able thing). If you are contemplating a purchase, check out RoombaReview. (That's how I found that Amazon had the best deal on this Roomba). You'll see a very active user community that regularly shares feedback / input. Also, I haven't used the scheduling feature yet."
2,"Good Idea, but not durable","While the Roomba is a great concept, they are not durable. We had our Roomba for less than a month and it died. Although the company is working with us to get the unit replaced, the fact that our unit died so quickly and we are having to spend money shipping the unit back and waiting on parts due to a backorder is unacceptable."
1,Roomba - Great Idea but Wouldn't Go,"The Roomba was a great idea but this unit did not work. The remote had very poor response - would take several attempts pressing the buttons before programming accepted. The Roomba itself would only run a few seconds and then just stop. No lights, no messages, no blockages - no known reason. We were using on hardwood floors in open areas but the response was poor and the unit really didn't run long enough at one time to see any results. We returned the unit and Amazon's return policy on this sale was excellent."
1,"After two units, I gave up","I have the original Roomba, and thought this would be a great update to a product I loved. The idea of the Scheduler sounded great so that it would automatically clean every day.The first unit I purchased worked for about a month. Disappointed, I returned it and brought home another unit. It died within a month, too. All the usual troubleshooting did not work.I returned the Scheduler and am back to my original (manual) Roomba."
3,Just ok,"We have had 3 of these Roomba vacuum models because my husband LOVES them. I on the other hand think they are just ok.When we first had it, after a few months, it started going nuts, just spinning and not going anywhere. We contacted iRobot and they sent us a software update. That seemed to solve the problem.The Roomba has done a lot of damage to our baseboards which really irks me. It has rubbed off layers of paint, not really dented them, but now we have to go into every room and sand and re-paint ALL our baseboards!!!!!!!!!! What a pain. You can buy an aftermarket bumper to put on your roomba to prevent this from happening.The other complaint I have is the battery. We have replaced the batteries several times but they don't seem to last. Roomba is really not made for a huge space, its made for a room size. It can't do my entire downstairs, because the battery will go out. So if you have a single room to do, its great."
1,Product didn't work,"I am still waiting for seller to respond back to me, as the product I purchased didn't work. I gave this item as a gift for xmas so you can imagine my frustration as well as the frustration of the person who received it.Until I see some action from the seller in this matter, I would reccomend that you DO NOT purchase anything from them."
1,Roomba,"We were extremely disappointed in the product we received. It has obviously been used and was shipped in two boxes: an outer box, and an inner box that was damaged in parts. The Roomba was filthy inside and out, including the dust/dirt receptacle that was filled with dirt. Additionally, we had problems finding a phone number to contact Amazon. When we were successful in contacting a Amazon representative, she was most helpful and e-mailed a return, postage-paid label."
1,Roomba is a cheap piece of junk,"The Roomba Scheduler is a cheap piece of plastic junk. The reliability is terrible. The roller broke, the platform that holds the rollers broke, the battery died and the gears came to a grinding halt. All within one year. The customer service is the worst. The design is terrible. When I opened it up to try to fix the broken gears I found that the inside of the machine was full of dirt. I threw it in the trash and I will never buy another IRobot product."
2,iRobot Roomba 4230 Remote Scheduler Robotic Vacuum,"One of my sons bought an iRobot Roomba 4230. He highly recommended it. Thus we bought one. It works fine, except the following. (1) It seems to repeat the same area too many times. (2) The remote does not work as well as the manual says. I tried to guide Roomba to its charger but the ""forward"" command buttom stops working after I push it more than three times. (3) I have not tried the Roomba long enough at one cleaning to see if it returns itself to the charger. We have a three-bedroom house. Perhaps we have to try cleaning only one bedroom to see if it will returns to the charger. (4) My son came to our house one time and showed me how to clean the surface of the sensors. He found out that my Roomba has only one sensor while his Roomba has two. I am not sure it it has anything to do with the problems I mentioned above."
1,what a piece of garbage,"This is one of the most horrible things my husband brought home. It is a filthy machine to clean... stupid plastic comb for the brush... give me a break... broke the first time i used it. The lines in the carpet are deplorable. I have to go over it with my REAL VACUUM to make the rooms look respectable. I would not recommend this to anyone. I guess if you are too lazy to use a REAL VAC, then this might work, but, not in this household!!! Really ticked when I saw what hubby paid for this piece of trash. I only wish we had not opened the box & tested it."
3,Robot Roomba,Way toooooo much money spend for this product. More time spend in cleaning the product than the work performed by the vacuum
1,doesn't work after a few months,The wheel sensors get dirty and send the device dancing in circles. To clean the sensors you need to void the warranty and remove six screws and carefully clean the delicate light sensors on each wheel.Then it works fine for another couple of outings before you need to repeat the process.
2,Third Roomba not the charm,"This was our third roomba. The first lasted two years before it had a stroke. The second one lasted 4 years, until it ran into a heavy high box that feel on it causing a concussion(our fault). This one worked fantastic and unlike the first that went through a battery every year, the batery on this lasted 4 years. So we obviously wanted something close to the second and did not need a lot of bells and whistles. This looked the closest to that model even though we did not need the scheduling.It was no where near as good as the second roomba. It is kind of chinzy compared to its sturdy predicessor. It can't even climb over the jam going into bathrooms like the earlier model, it stalls on vents and struggles on slightly thick carpeting. In addition we went through 2 bateries in a year. Now after 8 years of roombas we are back to the old vacuum cleaner. Wish I could get the old model back."
4,It's a great help around the house,"The Roomba is great to have in this busy world of ours. It helps keep the dust off our floors plus it is fun to watch it move around the house. It looks for dirt and picks it up. The bad part is the docking station, it has a hard time getting seated on the station, so it does not received a full charge. We just plug it in to the charging unit. As for all the other accessories we have not use them yet, so I have no opion on it."
1,A Racket,"This thing is a toy, nothing more. Will pick pick dirt from the floor but, even when new, had a relatively short battery life (returned to battery charger before finishing even a small room). Now, not quite two years old, the battery lasts approximately 10 minutes. The company is apparently aware of some problem because the website gives instructions for improving battery life. However, the procedure does not work. I have gone through the process four times with no improvement to battery life. Save your money, unless you want an expensive way to entertain your pets."
4,Love my Roomba!,"We purchased the Roomba Scheduler a month and a half ago. It can be loud, but I was aware of that thanks to other user reviews, and since I can schedule it to run when I'm gone, or just start it as I'm leaving the house, that was not a big issue. The benefit of Roomba keeping my hardwood floors clean without getting my ""big"" vacuum out several times a week definitely overcomes any negatives.Note: I did not realize that there are some ""consumable"" parts that will need to be replaced periodically (filter, roller brush and such). It came with a spare of each consumable, but you may want to research the cost and frequency of replacing these if that is an issue for you."
3,Not as bad as I thought at first.,"The first time I tried to use this, I was extremely disappointed. It seemed to have a hard time dealing with table and chair legs, and it was constantly getting hung up on the fringe on my living room rug. It didn't even do half of one room before it ran out of power. I wrote a rather uncomplimentary 1 star review and described it as totally useless.After trying it in other rooms, I decidd that I may have been a bit hard on the little guy. On bare wood floors and wall-to-wall carpeting, it worked pretty well. The rooms without area rugs are staying a lot cleaner than they were before."
3,Roomba Gone Crazy,"Machine worked well the first couple of weeks. Using it on a tile floor and does a fairly good job picking up dog hair and dirt. Then it started to go crazy and start and stop. Have not figured out the problem yet, but the manual that comes with the machine is not very detailed. Have not tried customer service yet either. Have done the basics of cleaning the machine and the dirt sensors."
2,Roomba,"After seeing good reviews and thinking of how easy it would be to just set a program and having my cleaning done I decided to buy a Roomba. Big Mistake. When I got it out of the package There were huge scratches all over the place. Since these were just cosmetic I went ahead and charged it. It took forever! I was about to put it back in the box and ship it back when it FINALLY was done. I set in the program and started before I went to work. When I got back I looked over at the dock and was not surprised to see it wasn't there. Unlike other reviews where it got stuch under furniture, mine was just sitting there. I immediatley sent it back to amazon. The cleaning it did wasn't very good either. The only fun I got ws seeing it move before I went to work.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,it sucks that it does not suck,"The IRobot is really fun to watch zoom around the room, but it does not really clean any type of floor. I tried it on carpet and hard floors and it did not perform well on either. I have returned this item."
2,Roomba Performance,"The Roomba worked great on the wood floors but, it could not redock on the docking station. It would go the station but would nto connect. I have to send it back. Now trying to decide if I want to try a different model. Hate the hassel of sending stuff back."
2,Roomba,The vacuum worked fine for one year. After that the battery died. Replacing it was a hassle and did not happen.
2,Loved it until it broke!,"I loved this little guy when I got it, but just after 5 months of normal use it broke! The people at Roomba wouldn't replace anything after the 90 day warranty had expired, so I ended up paying an extra $200 to have it replaced !The product is great, it's life-span is NOT!"
1,Great machine lousy batteries,"I bought our machine for Christmas 2005, by August after much use the battery had died. I tried several sources to purchase a new battery and none of them have one in stock, not even IRobot. I think that is absolutely pathetic.The fact that they are willing to take your old Roomba in on trade in, makes me think they are not very honest in how they do business. Too bad, I liked the machine!"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I have 5 dogs and cats and thought the Roomba probably wouldn't perform very well under the circumstances. I got a great deal from the Woot site on the scheduler and thought I'd give it a shot. I love how it gets all the dust bunnies out from under the beds, sofas, etc., that you just can't get with a normal vacuum cleaner unless you move all the furniture. I also think it does a pretty good job with the pet hair. Now, all my floors are tile so it's great in my home. Now, you do have to empty the bin a little more often than you'd want to, but I see that as only a tiny problem. I would definitely buy it again. I already have the scooba and think that it is wonderful too."
4,5 stars for entertainment value,"Our 4 1/2 year old has jumped in front of the roomba, but it doesn't matter, as it just goes on its way . . . . He loves it, and knows how to turn it on / off, work the buttons even, and even press the right 2 buttons to get it to self-dock; this robot-pet takes quite a workout from him, and is sturdy enough to come back for more.4 stars = really a 4 + . . . if the price were lower, and it didn't get hung-up sometimes under our kitchen cabinets. Othewise, the Schduler is awesome; we also started out with the cheper Red Roomba . . . while both have the same basic function, this one (2.1 sceduler) seems, well, a bit more revised and up-to-date.The daily scheduler just makes sense; programming is simple . . . also, we have lots of crumbs around. We got one for our Mom's 60th birthday -- esp. good w/ scheduler as a gift . . . then the person doen'sn't have to feel bad about not turning it on, because it does it by itself!"
4,Nice product,I was a little worried on this purchase. I know some models are not so good. I was very pleased. The only thing bad I can say is it does not like throw rugs especially if the have frilly edges. It will not work on thick carpet either. If you have throw rugs that are not too thick or have the frills on the edge invest in some carpet tape or Velcro and attach them to the floor. Otherwise the rumba tends to pull up the rug and get stuck. Battery life is not very good on carpet also. I invested in an extra battery which helps. Word of caution you really do need to dump the dust bin and clean the filter after ever use. Does a really good job cleaning. Not very noisy. It does get confused by the kitchen table sometimes. Cleans under the bed!!! Wohoo. Overall I was very pleased.I'm Jack and I give this little robot a thumbs up.
1,Unreliable and always breaking down,"Of the two I own, I had problems with both malfunctioning in less than a year. One malfunctioned within a couple of weeks and I ended up exchanging it for another. Both these have malfunctioned, and right now I have one that hasn't worked for over a month. IRobot has made suggestions on what is wrong, but the bottom line is that my roomba is STILL malfunctioning. $329 (plus tax) sitting idle. That's a lot of money to waste. While it was working, it was nice - kept white fuzzballs off my dark carpet."
1,Just OK,"Poor customer service at Roomba, No instruction book came with it, when I called I was on hold for 20 mins, I finally gave up & emailed them they said they would respond within 24 ohurs, they never did. About a year ago I was thinking of buying one & emailed Roomba a question, they never answered me then either. I have to give this item 1*, because while it works ok, it seems delicate & could easily break & I think the chances of Roomba actually honoring your warranty is very slim since you can't get in touch with them."
2,Not worth the price,"I bought this vacuum to save me some time but it is actually taking more time out of my day because I have to go over the areas again with our upright vacuum. The Roomba does not pick up what it should for the price, however my biggest complaint is that its ""random"" movement is not so random. It basically picks an area and goes around in circles until it runs out of batteries. I have a pretty small apartment and it can't even manage a whole room. In addition, it is not very quiet, especially for an apartment. My recommendation is that you same money and time and buy a regular vacuum!!!"
4,Like it but ...,"A newer, muuch better model was introduced approx 90 days after I ordered. Tried to get Irobot to upgrade (for additional cost) They would not cooperate. I know that they didn't have to do this but I have had other customer support depts. do the same. I really do like the product and would purchase again. You need to keep it clean. Takes a little effort."
3,Child of the KING,"Received book in good shape. Since I know nothing about music, it is a little hard to understand.If you are new to playing music, I feel a DVD (if you can find one) would be of more benefit to anyone for learning how to place your fingers and hold the instrument; (if you're planning on holding the instrument instead of placing it on a table)."
3,The famous mistake of a tower.,"Shrady does a good review of how the Leaning Tower of Pisa came about. It was due to building the tower on land that once belonged to a bog. When some of the sand shifted, the tower (companile) leaned. In 17 commissions over the years, more damage was done until finally in 1990, the tower was in danger of falling over. This is an interesting book about the history of the city state of Pisa, and its remarkable tower and cathedral. The book made me want to visit this historic building.This is a nice read about an interesting building and place. I actually learned something about architecture and soil conditions."
5,Glad to meet you..,"I'm so glad to have picked up this film. Yes, flying limbs and blood splattering.. decapitation and nudity. If you like LWC series you will enjoy this film. I plan on watching this film again soon. On the lines of Shadow Hunters, yet better imo. Cheers and happy slashing!"
3,Bohachi Bushido: Code of the Forgotten Eight,"Purchased this as a result of a review seen on G4 TV. It was a recommended ""buy,"" and I would agree--a great example of the genre that was being churned out by Japanese studios in the late 70's, early 80's."
1,save your money,"i bought this flick after reading previous positive reviews and after watching all i should say--save your money. yes, the cover is not misleading you--there are topless chicks in action but movie itself is done by kindergarden kids. the movie pretend to be reflection on real life events but when i see main character jump about 30 feet above ground what it has to do with reality?"
2,Not very exciting,"I was a little disappointed with this DVD. It's nice to have if you're a fan of Spain, but the content is limited and not put together in a very exciting or emotional way. There's also this one very out of place and annoying moment in the DVD where they keep showing close ups of people's eyes. I'm not sure what they were going for, but my family and I find it strange and annoying."
4,Breaking Musical Boundaries,"This CD has proven that country music can be diverse, interesting and cool. At first, I wasn't a fan, but after a few listens, I digged it. Shania's really strong on her uptempo stuff, but the ballads could use some work. The ballads wind up sounding similar and don't display the vocal range she displayed on her first album (listen to ""When He Leaves You""). She has great potential for better ballads. Too bad ""Come On Over"" wasn't as consistent as this CD. This CD shows that women have very complex sides to them. She also shows that you can be a diva without being mass stuck up. If you are a Shania fan, this is a good one."
3,"Good songs, not so good voice","While I love the songs on this album, I'm afraid I didn't much care for her voice. On the more upbeat songs she pulls it off pretty good, but on the slower ballads her voice lacks depth and emotion. However, I like all the songs on the album enough that I listen to it anyways. If this had been Trisha Yearwood singing these songs, it would have been a 5 star."
5,Excellent album!,"Every single song on this album shows her rich, deep voice and stellar song writing. It covers everything from boot stomping songs to slow ballads. The only dissapointment was God Bless the Child. The back ground music was excellent and the back up vocals by her ex husband were impeccable. With eight singles released from the album show it's versatility and appeal to traditional country fans. Six of the songs made it onto her Greatest Hits album. This is a goodalbum with longer songs than you will find on Come On Over, but there are less of them. No On Needs to Know was featured on the soundtrack for Twister and Any Man of Mine was her first number one single. You will find many fun songs and some slow touching songs."
5,Cool Album!,"Shania's huge vocal range comes throgh on this album with her venturing out and adding rough edges to the country sound and my favourite song ""If you're not in it for Love (I'm outta here)"" is just fantastic and I already own a copy so go and buy it"
3,OK.,"This is Shania's second album, and I personally think that it's OK. Not exactly my type of music or one of my favorites, but she still does a fair job. You see, I'm not a fan of country music, but I thought that Shania Twain's most recent album (1997) Come on Over is her best. So buy that one instead."
5,"Just as good if not better than ""Come On Over""","I like it when I purchase a CD like this, I enjoyed every song."
4,The Woman In Shania,"No doubt, this is Shania's best record to date. Too bad she has not follow it up with something as creative and powerful as this one. I became a fan of hers with this cd... so imagine my shock as she continues to slip from a true artist to a country Britney Spears. The uptempo songs on this cd are to die for. Not only do they kick butt, but Shania delivers the songs with such fire and twang spice that will keep you dancing and smiling all day. The best uptempo song is ""You Win My Love"". Her ballards are simply beautiful and is well thought out. She sings and writes with such meaning that you actually feel what she is doing. My favorite ballard is ""The Woman In Me"". Special praise needs to be given to ""No One Needs To Know"" and ""It Takes Two"" and ""Leaving Is The Only Way Out"". Listening to this album and then her other albums, its clear that Shania and Mutt is running out of ideas. ""The Woman In Me"" will stand as a true victory in both the country and pop field."
1,100+ New & Used for Sale - That should speak for itself,"The CD is monotonous and annoying after a few listens. After hearing the entire CD 5 or more times I realized that Shania has very little range. Hearing her live in concert further proved to me that she has very little talent, is the product of great marketing, sex appeal, and genius editing by her husband, Mutt. It's no wonder he is the best in the buisness."
5,"Excellent album, an ear opener!!","I have every tape of Shania's. I love them all!! This one really shows the talent in her! My favorite song is ""You win my love""!! Its beat makes me wanna dance no matter where I am when its on. I am looking forward to her next album!!"
5,This is Shania's best!!!,I think this is Shania's best album. The songs are all original. They don't sound like listening to the same one again and again. I would give up Come on over come on in or whatever for THE WOMEN IN ME. My faves are Any Man Of Mine and You win My Love.
4,"Very Good, But not as good as ""Come On Over""","This album has a great mix of ballads and country rockers. Take ""If You're Not In It For Love"", one of her best known songs, has a great beat that has terrific hooks and sticks in your head for a long time after. ""No One Needs To Know"", a song from the ""Twister"" soundtrack, is probably the best song on the album with its unique lyrics and sound. This album is excellent but it does have its shortcomings. There is a few filler songs here including ""If It Don't Take Two"" & ""Raining On Our Love"". But with most of the songs so good, a few filler can be forgiven. Her newest album, ""Come On Over"", is filler free as every song could be a hit. Get that album first and then this."
4,HAVE YOU HEARD...,"This album went something like 11 or 12 times platinum, so you know it's probably a keeper right from the start. The Woman In Me has a bit more of a traditional country music feel to it than Come On Over does, but it's still very accessible to anyone who's not a real country fan. The CD is full of songs that make you feel good, and might get you thinking ""country music ain't too bad""!"
1,I just don't get it!!!,"Icky music! What happened to old time country music? It's all looks, hype, not country. City slicker to the max. I saw her on TV and Yuck! As they said on ""In Living Color""- ""Hated It!"""
1,This is posibly the worst CD I have ever listened to.,This was so bad I went strait back to the shop and trade it in for somthing good like LIMP BIZKIT now they are good.
3,"""You Must Be Joking, Right?""","Bland ballads (she sounds bored on ""Home Ain't Where His Heart Is"" & ""The Woman In Me"") & obnoxious songwriting. The upbeat ""Any Man of Mine"" was the first of many sound-alike songs (I wonder how many times she can get away with recycling the same heavy beat)."
4,Love Shania,Shania's earlier works prior to her last 2 well known pop albums. Songs are still fun and have a bit of the country flair.
5,The Ultimate Shania Classics!,"I have owned ""The Woman In Me"" since it was released in 1995. In fact, this was the first country CD I ever owned. It's loaded with chart toppers and had awesome fun videos for the songs. This album is the truest country package Shania has done to date. Even the songs that never were released for singles were outstanding! This was the time she was in heavy rotation on country radio and CMT. I miss those days! I would give this more than 5 stars if I were allowed to."
5,"A solid, dependable read.","Belonging takes place in the same area of Scotland as Wild Highland Home. If you liked Wild Highland Home, you will like this. It is however, very different. The main character Sally is a take-charge character who finds herself suddenly adrift. A vacation/escape to a family -owned inn turns into more than she bargained for when she finds herself managing the day-to-day operations of the hotel. Alexander Raife has a light touch and absorbing prose. This is not your typical ""romance"" book. The characters are well-written and for the most part likeable. The day-to-day chronicle of their lives is absorbing. Clare and Donald from Wild Highland Home are mentioned as well as other characters from that book. Trudy, a character I liked in Wild Highland Home has a more prominent role in this book. A solid read."
4,nice Scottish romance,"A nice little story of a woman who goes back to visit an old family home of her childhood for a holiday only to become entrenched in life there. Instead of escaping life and having time to herself she is thrown into helping to manage a busy seasonal hotel.Not only does she not resent the change in her life, she also finds, as the title suggests, a sense of belonging.The story has a beautifully described landscape, however, it was a little slow for me, and perhaps too close to ""Wild Highland Home"", which is also set there, with the same characters."
1,Awful!,"Awful book! I like some of Alexandra Raife's books, but this one is awful. First there is the tease that is hinted at but not revealed. Just tell us, for pity's sake, so we can understand what is going on! Then the main male character is so unlikable that you keep hoping someone will show up who is really worth caring about. When I think of some of this author's other books, it's difficult to believe that this was even penned by her. The bad language and emotional shifts are excessive, and I don't care for the ""sex for fun with no commitment"" attitude. ""We'll just have sex and nobody will get hurt!"" What is that??? ""I want to see your naked body and make love to IT???????????????????"" A huge disappointment and I can't believe an author like Mary Stewart who has recommended this author has read this particular book."
5,My son's favorite video,"This is, by far, my 2 year old son's favorite video. And, considering the fact that he can watch the same video over and over and over and over again, I find that this particular one is actually tolerable."
5,A great re-visit,"I pulled this out today as a way to welcome in the summer and it's lazy mood. It's been over a year since I played ""Reformation"" and I am happy to see that it's subtle power is in tact. This cd epitomizes the UK sensibility towards hip and soulful electronic music. It's fuses sample based hip hop beats with soulful musiciality and soothing vocals. A perfect soundtrack for a lazy summer day. This album transports you start to finish to a stress-free place -- no jarring grooves, nor trendy remix edits, or cloying vocals -- just smooth up-to-the minute aurrial sophistication. This cd has a timeless-ness about it that I will no doubt keep returning to in future days."
5,Zenobia - Home,"Zenobia's CD ""Home"" is awesome!! Zenobia's lyrics tell stories of love lost and found. From the killer hook of the title track ""Home"" to the infectiousness of ""One and Only"", this album's a winner!! I enjoyed listening to this CD very much. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes good music.Eric Heithaus"
4,This is the best microwave cookbook I have ever used.,"Carolyn Dodson is the master of the microwave. The recipes she provides in her cookbook are delicious, easy to prepare, and down to earth. In the book you will also find helpful hints to show you how to use your microwave more effectively."
3,A Beacon Hill Mystery in the Shadow of Bertrum's,"I read all three in this series and this was enjoyable, but pales in comparison to Bertrum's Bower"
2,"I agree, Is this a bootleg or what?","I bought this item nearly 2 years ago but having read other reviewers' complaints of the absence of any sort of cover or artwork I thought I should add my concerns so that if Amazon are ignoring what's going on, they might finally do something.The cd I received was in a jewel case also with no cover at all. The disc itself has a colour rendition of the main cover image."
5,Kubrick At His Best,"This is a fantastic Kubrick movie. Based on a novel of equal respect, this movie details troubled youth, violence, and sex in a modern-yet-more-so world. The slang of the young men in the movie is a mixture of British and Russian slang terminology created by the book's author. A must-see for the Kubrick fan out there."
2,"Great album, but Caveat Emptor on this version","This version of Clockwork Orange Sndtrk is the same material on the original lp version, but the packaging seems a little lacking and might be a pirated copy.First of there's no covers in the shrinkwrapped jewel case, there was a UPC sticker on the shrinkwrap.The CD is a printed silver, not a burned blue CD, with a picture that looks like the original CD with the track listing and ""made in USA"", but the printing quality on the CD is a little off and looks like it came from a scan, not from WB or Rhino. It also lacks any publishing info and even most bootlegs have that info on them.If I bought this used for about $10 I'd be happy, but at the current, over $20 price, I would have passed and kept listening to the lp until it come back into print."
5,Viddy Well My Brothers Viddy Well,"Well, what can I say about the marriage of film and music other than this marriage has only been done to perfection one time. A Clockwork Orange Stanley K's seminal work, Burgess' bane and the best film ever made is matched in intensity only be the score. The music for this film was frightening, exciting, funny and PERFECT. I whole-heartedly recommend this soundtrack to all those that love the film!"
1,Pirated Music,The product I received was not a legitimate product from all appearances. I purchased this item as a replacement for my lost copy of the Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange OST on compact disc. The product I received didn't even resemble my original nor was it packaged in a manner consistent with published music. I immediately destroyed the disc and all accompanying materials.
3,Not as good as Wendy Carlos' A Clockwork Orange,"The original soundtrack album for A Clockwork Orange truncates too much of the music. If you are interested in this album for the great electronic synthesizer music heard in the film, you should instead buy ""Wendy Carlos' A Clockwork Orange"" (5 stars) which has the same music, complete and uncut, and has also been recently digitally remastered for great sound."
5,real horrorshow,"Oh my brothers, when you slooshy this horrorshow work of art you will feel all the hairs stand up on your plot like slow malenky lizards, gravity all nonsense now. Lovely Ludwig Van's glorious ninth and Rossini's ""Theiving Magpie"" will sharpen you up a bit and get you ready for a little twenty to one. So comport yourself publicwise and spend some of that cutter me brothers!"
3,Sounds like an old 45 on a cardboard box record player,"The music in this collection is great but the audio quality is just plain bad. I am no audiophile - tone deaf as a tin can - but even I can hear the poor quality of this one.I suppose that, because of their relative obscurity historically, there just may be no better quality original tapes to start from.I don't regret buying the CD but, unfortunately, I will have to keep spending on The Troggs in the hopes of finding something that is of better quality."
4,Insight into dictionary debates.,"I love dictionaries, and Webster's Third is the one I use most frequently. I had never thought of it as controversial. So it's delightful to read this book, which shows how controversial it was at first, and why. In doing so, it gives great insight into lexicographical theories as a whole."
5,Astounding!,These recordings have been beautifully restored- without sacrificing any of that pure quality that wax recordings picked up. 18 wonderful examples of both Segovia's work as well as that of the lovely Louise Walker. You will be pleased with this selection!
1,Save your money,I was EXTREAMLY disappointed with this book. Seriously save your money. In this book you get just a hand full of images which look like a zeroxs of a copy. You'd be better off going to your local library and wasting less money using their copier and getting better quality from it or getting something else for that price which is why I'd give it a zero in stars (but I guess this review doesn't give you that option hence the 1 star)... it's not even worth a quarter of what you pay for it or the time you'd take to click and order it.
4,one page wonders,"This spiral-bound book has a great one-page description/one-page map format which makes it easy to use in the car. Huegel has travelled backroads both familiar and less-known and his descriptions are accurate if a little bland. At times I wish he had expanded his prose beyond the rigid one page format but the visitor with a sharp eye can find the sites and sights he omits. He adventures with his family and avoids rough roads like the Lippincott Mine Road in DVNP (a wise decision as drivers need experience here) concentrating on easier routes, although the Inyo Mountain trip definitely needs 4WD (its pretty tough in spots). He also includes many routes outside the familiar park system proving that you don't have to go to a designated scenic area to enjoy driving in the California desert."
4,Sure does help one appreciate the desert!,"I bought this book for a spring fling in Death Valley and other desert areas. I never realized before the places I could drive to, all the little dirt roads to really neat places. Glad I bought it."
5,Great for that long drive.,We listened to this cd and others of Chonda's and laughed the whole way across the countryside. Everyone loved it.
4,Priceless music,"In this stunning 4 cd set you'll find the very best of Abba, a group now seemingly overlooked in the cannon of today's music. This is a shame, since the tracks here show how innovative the Sweedish quartet truly was, combining a pleasent mix of pop-based music with classical elements and the stunning vocals of the band members. The only reason I gave this set only 4 stars is the treatment of one of my favorite Abba tracks - the great lost song ""Just Like That"", which is presented here in the ""Abba Undeleted"" track mixed in with snippits of other unreleased songs. Here ""Just Like That"" is reduced to two repeats of the chorus only - hardly fair treatment for such a great track. I was sure this would be included in its full form, but sadly it wasn't. Oh well...maybe it'll slip out of the vaults someday..."
4,ABBA 101.,"A fine collection of ABBA's hit singles and key album tracks, along with an entertaining mix of outtakes and rarities. A few minor quibbles: the drastically edited version of ""The Name of the Game"" is used, rather than the far superior full-length album version, and the booklet does not contain the lyrics. All in all, though, this is all the ABBA most casual fans would ever want, and is a good collector's set for the more devoted fan."
4,great music,"Rocking every morning on the way to work...only wish that artists would put all the really upbeat tunes on one cd...love the voices on the slower songs, but when driving, would really appreciate more up beat on one cd, same goes for country/weatern, can appreciate the slower tunes, but would like to be able to just slip one cd in and rockout the entire time..."
3,"Yes, but....","A lot of their best music is in this collection, but there's a great deal of dreck here as well. I'm surprised that they didn't put the musical version of their grocery list in there, somewhere. All in all, I say that there's too much foam, and not enough beer."
2,Where's the beef?,"When someone buys a box set they are usually already fans so they don't need another copy of Dancing queen or Chiquita. Why not include some rarities like their final concert on the rooftop of the Swedish Embassy or a dvd of their Folsom Prison Show only available as a bootleg?I also think it would have been better to have the songs in random order as while their songs from the later years are catchy they pale in comparison to their groundbreaking earlier work and by the time I get to disc three I am sleepy tired. I mean how can you compare ""Put on Your White Sombrero"" to 'Happy Hawaii""?It's a shame all the infighting and Frieda's anorexia caused this great band to dissolve into a heap of doggy poo. Clam chowder is one thing but silly string can stick to the wall, I guess clam chowder can to now I think back to Bjorns drinking problem and his solo unplugged album."
2,Do not buy this for its current price($40),"I bought is product when it was a GOLD BOX DEAL, for $13. I was buying this kit mainly for the HDMI cable, so it thought it was a good deal. The HDMI cable produces a good picture, the fan worked but it was very weak, and the control charger is basically junk. The control charger charges through the USB, and only works while the PS3 is on. You can just as well use the charging cable that comes with your controller. Only one out of the three items in the kit worked well, so I would recommend you pass on this kit."
4,"Good read for managers and OO beginners, but hardly more","I will agree with the previous readers that it is an excellent book, BUT ONLY FOR TWO TYPES OF AUDIENCES: 1) programmers who have a very, very vague idea about OOD/OOP and feel intimidated and/or confused by official Microsoft Developer's Guide. 2) Project Managers who does not have clear idea how to approach the development with VFP correctly and want to get some knowledge fast. I will recommend this book to the programmers familiar with OO technology ONLY AS A FAST REFRESHER COURSE, since the most of them are familiar with material in the book."
4,"An excellent introductory book, but not just that.","Drawing on the best of two other books I used to recommend, this is a great book for those moving to Visual FoxPro.It combines the clarity of explanation of David Taylor's ""Object Oriented Technoogy: A Manager's Guide"" with the design principles and CRC approach from Rebecca Wirfs-Brock (et al) ""Designing Object Oriented Software"".With the benefit for Visual FoxPro programmers of examples in the FoxPro language instead of C++ or Smalltalk"
3,Tasty enough,The description sounds yummy. They were not as good as they looked or sounded. Not bad but tastes a little like paper. I prchased a whole box
2,Salty!!!!,"These chips, although tasty, are loaded with salt! The barbecue flavor was nice, but the chip had a 'prefab' texture and no fiber. Stick with your favorite T-chip...and never [I mean NEVER] buy any product with the word 'healthy' in the title."
5,New Pyle Pro 121 Speakers,"These Speakers arrived well packaged, in just a few days. They are lightweightand sound very good. I use them as floor monitors and they really get it done.For a great sound, and price these are just OUTSTANDING !"
4,Chronicles of Old Salem: A History in Miniature,"Here in the most selective form is covered the colonial expansion of England during which Massachusetts was founded. The growth of Salem is traced frm 1626 to 1932 against the state and national scene. The author traces the history of witchcraft from 1484, when a Papal decree made it a crime, to Salem's participation in the mass madness. The book covers the Quaker whippings, the military disaster of King Philip's war for Indian and white survival, the privateering years in which Salem became so great a sea power that Salem meant America in exotic ports of the world.Comprehensive in scope, the book is authenticated by leading scholars in America and England, contains bibliography, index, addenda, and is illustrated with twenty-eight selections from the Essex Collections."
3,"Odd little book, this.","Herge, The Shooting Star (Methuen, 1942)An odd little book, quite different than the rest of the series. In this one, a shooting star falls to Earth bearing a new metal, and Tintin and friends race to claim it before a greedy corporation gets their hands on it. Critics have speculated that The Shooting Star was a great deal more political than most of Herge's work, which makes sense given the time during which he was drawing it (the Vichy government ascended in France in 1940). Still, it's typical Tintin in that it's packed with action and intrigue. Fans of the series will enjoy it. ***"
5,This is a must read.,"I struggled with Photoshop Elements 4 until I found Deke McClelland's Photoshop Elements 4 one-on-one. His training methods are well designed and will lead you to an understanding of the power of Photoshop Elements 4 I never imagined. The video is better than first class and the book is written in a very clear way that leads the student on a guided descovery of Elements 4. I asked my local camera store for help and they promised something in the future. When I cruised through Amazon.com and read other reviews of this book I simply took a chance and bought it. Wow, what a wonderful surprise. Deke won't let you down. Paul"
5,Great book for learning Photoshop Elements 4,This book is easy to follow. I worked through the entire book in 3 nights.If you just got photoshop for your pc and you need some reference material than I reccomend this book. I learned all kinds of great things from this book.
5,Photoshop Elements 4 One on One,"The book and accompanying DVD are being used in a class I am taking on Photoshop Elements 4. Both of them make it much easier to understand what 4 is capable of and how to use the program, especially the tools. Without instruction, complimented by 1 on 1, I would not be able to use even a small percentage of the power of 4. 1 on 1 goes step by step in 12 chapters of ""how to"" fix, enhance, organize, and share photos."
5,"Fast paced, but deeply informative","O'Reilly is a quality publishing company. You really can't go wrong with them. And this book holds that tradition. The text is tight. The example images are great. The design is innovative. The topics are covered thoroughly. And it shares that with the other O'Reilly book on the topic; Photoshop Elements 4 The Missing Manual.What stands out with this book is the depth in the description of how each feature works. Filters in Photoshop are complex, and understanding how they work will help you use them more effectively. This book does a better job explaining the function of the filters.That being said, this book is faster paced than the Missing Manual book. If you understand the basics and are looking for some deeper material, I would pick this book. If you are looking for an introduction I would pick the Missing Manual."
4,Very Helpful,This book has been very helpful to me in learning to use Photoshop Elements 4. The lessons are given in a systematic way and Deke walks you through each one. He provides photographs for you to work with that match the pictures in the book so it is easy to compare your products with his. He integrates directions and keyboard shortcuts in all the activities so you learn a variety of ways to access the tools you want naturally and spontaneously. I use the book all the time and learn more each time I repeat an activity. It is a great reference for when I'm trying to do something with my own photographs. The only thing I don't like is he doesn't always explain why you are doing what you are doing and I can't always intuit what it is that tool is specifically best at doing. I wish he would clarify the tools' uses more directly.
3,Good Introduction But....,"The book is well written and organized. However, the step by step approach does not allow for a good understanding of the tools, etc. that one is using. There are still so many questions I have when I work on photos. It also needs a much more in depth review and instruction of restoring old photographs. The section on color was very good and I liked it the best. Since I have a Mac, the first lesson is worthless. The Bridge application that ships with the Mac version is very different and quite sophisticated since it is part of the fuller versions of Photoshop. It all added to the learning curve. On the whole, it is an excellent book to get started. Now I wish I could find a book that explains Elements so I can learn to use the program to its fullest."
4,it works.,it works. however i strongly suggest not drinking alcohol if using this as a supplement. it greatly decreases the speed at which you metabolize alcohol and subsequently takes less alcohol to get intoxicated. also suggest drinking copious amounts of water while taking BHT or you may get headaches.
2,Poor sound quality,"The music is good however the quality of the sound is so poor that it is annoying and I probably won't listen to this CD very often, if at all."
5,I love her work!,"A must have book for all photography fans and amateur photographers. Annie has her own unique style - she knows exactly how to seize the moment. Her early photographs describe her family, Rock stars and their fans and even simple people - in that special moment that will never return, that moment that Annie so creatively captured. Annie's Photographs, are semi-journalistic, and describe a given situation - no excess face powder and bright lights. Besides these, the book contains her most famous ""staged"" photographs, in which Annie took pictures of famous people from her own perspective. I must say, that the scenarios and poses chosen for most celebrities fit them like a glove. My favorite photographs are the one in which Woopie Goldberg is soaking in a bath full of milk, and the beautiful photo of Sting, standing covered in mud, in the middle of the desert (of course, there is also the famous photograph of John and Yoko)."
5,fantastic photo book,annie's book is an incredible collection of celebrity images with a series of text that describes her ascent to the top in her field
4,A pleasure to listen to.,"I heard the first two selections played on a classical station that broadcasts over the web. Both selections became instant favorites of mine. The suite in D has a haunting beauty (I love the intro), and the concerto no 2 in G has a wonderfully playful style. Both are a pleasure to listen to. I'm looking forward to hearing the concerto no 1 in D when I get my CD."
5,Worth the price,"While I was at first skeptical of the price per blade, after using a full 5 pack I'm buying more. They are initially razor sharp like any new blade, but the ""fall off"" is fantastic. I would have run through 10+ cheapies doing the same job as a single Lenox. I use them for tough jobs in the garage as well as cutting vinyl sticker sheets - which requires a nice sharp blade to make a clean cut. Highly recommended!"
2,OK for the Price,I was looking for a more durable blade for my Gerber folding box knife holder (which is great). These seem to last about as long as non-titanium blades and they cost quite a bit more. Not sure if it's worth it.
1,Positively un-Vonnegutesque,"Despite the hoity-toity tossing about of educational credentials, to paraphrase Bridget Jones (if you loved Bridget Jones, you will NOT love this), this book is positively un-Vonnegutesque.I didn't fall for the defensive reviews seemingly submitted by the authors' friends and school chums. I fell for the older trick: being seduced by the negative reviews into thinking that there was much ado about something. Occasionally people will pan a book just because it went against their ideology or they didn't like the author...whatever. Controversy tends to stir up interest. In this case, there was nothing to justify loving or hating the book.Bottom line: the book has the intellectual weight of meringue. A few recipes tied to personal stories that seem trumped up but still a yawn. That's it. Five minutes in the bookstore or using the online ""search inside"" function will give you the gist in a few pages. Most who do that ahead of time won't bother to take it home."
4,"Good recipes, good stories, good book!","I came across this book in my daughter's kitchen while visiting her in Oregon. I found myself reading the whole thing during the course of our one-week visit, but it was after I had copied out the third recipe (these are two unusual acts for me, reading whole cookbooks and copying recipes) that I realized another copy of the book deserved to be bought. For good recipes covering a wide terrain, and for short, honest perspectives on a lot of different relationships, it's an excellent book. And I'll admit: I'm far from a saint, but it is nice to be able to read about other guys and occasionally think ""well, gee, at least I never did THAT!"""
4,FIFA world cup 2010 - All the Goals,"A nice compilation of all the goals of the FIFA World Cup 2010 in South Africa. However, comparing to the previous world cup, Germany 2006 - All the Goals, it was not as exciting. Enough said. This would be a great collection for years to come."
2,poor quality dvd,"the content of the dvd is ok, but it is really poor quality for the amount of money I had to pay.Pitty for such a large price."
5,Very comprehensive coverage of ISO coding,"I develop CAD/CAM software for CNC-Lathes and Mills.This is the best book I have ever had in my hands, when it comes to the covering ISO coding of lathes and mills.It covers basically all aspect of machining with CNC Machines that uses ISO encoding.It is very detailed, and have very good examples and diagrams that explains all the described procedures."
3,Broad Coverage,"Given the number of CNC devices on the market - each with their own optimized control, it is likely difficult to write a book with sufficient depth in any one area to satisfy all readers. I found Smid's book to give a broad overview of the topic with good coverage of the classes of instructions and interactions between the instructions. Between his coverage of lathe specific material and focus on Fanuc controllers, the amount of information that I could apply to my Heidenhain controlled mill was significantly reduced, but still of significant value."
3,CNC book through Amazon,"The book was received in excellent condition, complete with the enclosed CD, which had never been used.The subject matter was not exactly what I was looking for, but close enough to allow me to learn much of what I was after.Time to receive the article was also acceptable."
3,CNC machining from a users point of view.,"This is a great reference book. If you were lecturing or designing CNC equipment, this is a must. It is the kind of book you will read once and then put away. If you are a CNC operator/programmer, this really is not the book. There are no cutting speed, or feed tables or suggestions on machining methods. You will still need your Mechanical Engineers handbook to get your CNC machining correct."
5,Rreplacement handle works great,"I bought this as a replacement for my original power handle toothbrush. I'm very happy with it, since it works fine with original charger. The only con, and it's a minor one, is that it doesn't have the charge indicator light of the original handle. Price beats replacing the charger too!"
3,Works as advertised,I bought this as a replacement for my 15 year old Braun Power Handle that died last year. This one works with the round charger with the slot. Accepts the brush attachements. I can only hope this one lasts half as long as the original.
2,bare bottom,this is just replacement drive unit doesn't come with charger ar single brush head. I don't think it was advertised this way. Therefore it is not a bargen at all. Dosn't even have a led indicating charging. You shopers out there go for better deal
5,Power toothbrush is the bomb!,"Ever since I got my Oral B power toothbrush, my dental checkups have been superb.I highly recommended the Braun Oral B."
4,Jerry's Braun electric toothbrush review,"ORAL-B TOOTHBRUSH VITALITY SONIC CLEANThe power toothbrush works great, cleans teeth very well. Theon-off swich operates much better than the older model."
1,Missing components,"The product was not in the original box and there was no charger base to put it on, no brushes, nothing but the engine. I still cannot use it. Furthermore, the pictures published in Amazon.com for the product doesn't reflect exactly what they delivered. It seems to be a try to deceive the customers.I DO NOT recommend this seller."
3,Is Product New or Used? Hard to Tell,"As sold by the Buy-It-Now-Store, this product arrived in what appeared to be a cut-up piece of the original plastic packaging held together by staples. There is no warranty or other documentation. As such, it's difficult to tell if this is genuinely a new or perhaps a used product. In either case, you're on your own should anything malfunction in the next couple of weeks. Knowing this, I would have purchased the comparable Vitality model in full packaging and with the charger and new brush head at the same price instead. I've used the Ultra I received, and it seems to function okay (less powerful than the Advance Power it's replacing) - but caveat on what you're getting."
5,Great tooth brush,My first one lasted about 15 years. When it gave out. I could not find a matching replacement in any store. But I found in on amazon.com. Works great.
4,Still Great at 70,"Though Porter is in his 70's this is one of the best albums he has made. The selections tell timeless stories of family, of love gone wrong, and love he'd like to have again. In other words, just good old country music. His delivery is still great and the music ain't bad. If you like Porter, or just classic country, buy this album."
3,read it on wikipedia instead,"Never ended up reading this book, but it was everything I needed it to be for my class (purchased it for a German Lit class but ended up just reading the book summary on wikipedia)"
3,A great Analysis,"In this book, Michael O'Hanlon suggests a way out of this budgetary fix. In contrast to the current military posture calling for the United States to be capable of waging two Desert Storm-like wars at a time, he argues for a ""Desert Storm plus Desert Shield plus Bosnia peacekeeping"" capability as well as selected economies in weapons modernization programs to save a total of $15 billion a year. He is a great analyst and I would definitely recommend this book to be read."
3,Sugar Blues,It certainly gave a lot of details of how sugar came to be in all our lives. It was to much detail for me. But it was interesting to know how it came to be.
2,A difficult read,"The focus is far too much on the history of sugar and not enough on why I should abandon it. It's a very dense read with small, dense typeface. Not much in the way of anecdotes or testimonials. I suspect there are more inspirational books out there."
2,Great history book.,I was looking for a book about the effects of refined sugar on the body. Sugar Blues was a book about the history of refined sugar. Duffy repeatedly says how bad sugar is for you but doesn't back it up with any explanations.
3,Got Blue Reading This Book,"I am sure this book is good for some people, just not me. Never finished it. Yeah, I know, refined sugar is bad for me. It is all about moderation. Abstinence in an ideal perfect world. Maybe someday I will wipe the dust off the cover and finish the book, but I doubt it."
3,"Thoughtful, if unscientific, indictment of refined sugar","This book gives a very persuasive case for eliminating refined sugar from your diet. Substantial historical perspective is offered. However, many conclusions reflect flawed logic and the author's bias. It's time for an updated edition, tempered with objective expert opinion. This book is particularly recommended reading for diabetics."
4,"Watching my sugar habit, but with a grain of salt","This is an important book on a vital subject. Very worth reading, as long as you remember not to believe every word. Parts of it seem to be well researched, but the untrue parts make it hard to know how to view the rest. The author speculates at length on the medical discovery of diabetes, implying it was unknown before refined sugar entered the diet in the last millenium, but in fact diabetes was described more than 2000 years ago. It would be nice if there were a revised edition or another book on the subject that was more based in fact. But after reading this it's hard to say exactly what differentiates sugar from opium or cocaine: they all have clear physiological effects, all are found naturally in plants, and all can create a dependency. Of course sugar is a lot cheaper and government sanctioned, and those who really can't tolerate it (diabetics) get insurance-covered treatment."
5,Awesome!,"This book should be a must read for everyone. It is very insightful and if you want to be healthy you need to know what an awful drug refined sugar actually is and how it is destroying your body. The truth is most people are sugar addicts and do not realize it, we are trained from an early age that sugar is a reward for finishing our meals, we are rewarded with candy for doing a good job, the media portrays soda and sweetened drinks as hip and cool ""it's the real thing"" and""Obey your thirst"" many processed foods are loaded with sugar and we consume them in mass without bothering to read the label of the ingredients, Why? because most of us are sugar junkies! we are addicted to the stuff! and the sad thing is that it's no different than cigarettes, alcohol, crack or meth! Do yourself a BIG favor buy this book, read it and take charge of your health, make no mistake refined sugar is POISON!!!!"
4,Truth is in book,"Educated on sugar for SURE. Sometimes, truth hurts but at least its the truth. Sugar is bad esp. in quanities we americans are taking in. I will cut back, but can't go without it completely."
5,Everyone's Got them Ol' Sugar Blues,Ever wonder why you feel like crap? Well just take a look at what's in the food you eat to find out why. Just get this books & see what it's all about. The Matrix has you addicted & under control & only you can break free if you know how.
5,I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PUT DOWN THIS BOOK!!!!,This book has shed new light on the evils of refined sugar. I have not been able to put this book down. I now read all food labels and it's scary all the sugar filled products I was used to eating.I now shop at organic food stores and amazingly my food cravings have dropped drastically. THIS IS A MUST READ!!!
2,A History of Sugar Consumption and No More,"If you want a complete history of ""sugar,"" then buy this book (I should have rated it 5 stars for historical background).If you are looking for a practical way to cut sugar from your diet, look elsewhere."
3,Not what I thought,"Interesting concept. I do believe that sugar does more harm than good. I want to get right into the facts but this book is difficult to read. I made the mistake of googling the author and reading about his wife, Gloria Swanson who was his informant about the ill effects of sugar. I discounted what she says because she seems crazy due to her bio (married 5 times). I will try to read this book again but I want more of a diet plan and hard facts."
2,Author bias makes it hard to read,"While the message has much validity, the author's presentation is so biased that it is very hard to finish reading the very short book"
5,Emotionally Invigorating!,"Cheryl St. John has done it once again! Her current release, ""This Week I Thee Wed"" is certain to pull at heart strings. Her detailed description of the characters involves the reader before they know they are entwined within these characters lives! Bravo Cheryl! Lori Kolin Mofield, Fan, Friend, Author"
3,Entertaining!,"My girlfriend told me about this movie and how much she liked it when she was a kid, so I bought it. It was well before my time, but I enjoyed it! While not among my favorite movies, I don't regret purchasing it at all!"
1,"Great movie, bad DVD, here's the solution","Buy the Region 2 DVD (released by Fabulous Films in 2008) from amazon UK. It's widescreen (*not* pan & scan), plus it comes with a Director's Commentary which offers good insights from Joseph Sargent (who also directed the original ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"").Admittedly, it won't be cheap. Current exchange rate amounts to eighteen bucks plus shipping. But you'll then be able to enjoy one of the classics of science fiction. It predates WarGames by more than ten years, and offers a more realistic--if darker--vision of the future of computer intelligence.*********************UPDATE November 2009Looks like this has been discontinued by the manufacturer. Wonder if that means a proper Region 1 release (widescreen) might be in the works? Maybe a 40th Anniversary Edition next year??"
1,4:3!!!!,"I knew going in that this was a 4:3 NOT 16:9 movie but I remember this movie from years ago and enjoyed it. Only 1 star because of the aspect ratio, 4 stars for the movie.Note to studios: The dual sides DVDs with 4:3 on one side and 16:9 on the other side are bad enough but this is the 21st century. Get those movies out in their original formats!!!"
4,Colossus - still a vision of the future,"Released in 1970, this an excellent motion picture still rings true today. Freedom is an illusion."
3,Great movie. ROTTEN DVD,"I saw this movie when it first debuted back in 1970. It's been a favorite of mine ever since. My VHS tape of the film is getting rather old, so I was really pleased when I learned that it was being released on DVD. Much to my dismay, this is one of the cheapest DVDs I've ever seen.* The sound is mono only.* The aspect ratio is full-screen, even though the original film was widescreen.* No subtitles, no foreign language tracks.* It doesn't even have a scene menu. (Want to get to a particular scene? Then just keep hitting the ""skip ahead"" button on your DVD player.)"
1,Help! I'm an interesting movie trapped in FullScreen format!,"A friend invited a group to watch this fun little movie. While the content itself was an interesting story whose themes are cited in modern science fiction movies, the presentation spoils the effect.One of those who watched it with us has worked in the TV industry for some time and had an explanation. He suggested that Universal just used the copy of the film normally sent to TV stations, making a quick-and-dirty version for DVD -- an easy and inexpensive way to produce a copy for home. Taking the actual film out of the vault, correcting color, and re-mastering would be more costly.My friend is returning his copy to Amazon, unhappy with the quality."
1,Great movie ... avoid this disk,"Colossus is one the best '60s SF films, intelligently written, well directed, with a fine cast. But if you're a fan (as I am) you should avoid this DVD. For some inexplicable reason, Universal has chosen to dump a pan-and-scan version on the market, totally destroying Joseph Sargent's widescreen compositions. Why these companies continue to ruin good movies in this way is impossible to understand."
3,Ahead of It's Time,"While science fiction has frequently dealt with creations getting out of control, Colossus' has enough grounding in reality to be frightening. Long before The Terminator, and the creation of Sky Net, Colossus was created to be the ultimate computer-controlled defense system, which almost as soon as it comes on line, wants links to similar computers in other countries. Instead of creating machine monsters to conquer mankind, it uses the threat of launching nuclear weapons to control the actions of humans, in order to create a machine's vision of a perfect world.As with many sci-fi stories there are themes that comment on our strengths and weaknesses, not the least of which is a warning about concentrating too much power in one system/entity.While the technology seen is obviously dated: in one scene Colossus has to design a data to voice system for the stupid humans; it doesn't mean that this film doesn't hold relevance today."
4,Ultimate Paranoia,"I first saw this film as a child and just the basic premise of computers with intelligence taking over the world was frightening enough. But the fact that in this film these man-made comfort devices were able to do so because we became so dependant upon them makes the story more relevant today. Colossus is able to intrude easily into the intimate lives of the main characters much deeper than Big Brother ever dreamed. And when it links up with other supercomputers when it sees mankind as a problem... well, let's just say they should have seen it coming and maybe we should too. The lack of a traditional music score only heightens the realism of the telling and the ending is not the most comforting. Still, the story obviously inspired James Cameron when he came up with the Terminator series. After seeing this you may look at your PC in a different way."
4,"Technically fine, now dated computer takes over the world","This film follows the standard plot of a gigantic computer taking over the world. Except this book and film SET that standard.A super-computer, Colossus, is constructed to control the weaponry of the United States. Unknown to the U.S., the Soviets have built a similar machine. The two machines join forces against their masters, and attempt to rule the world.A fine example of a cold-war techno-thriller.Occasionally stilted acting, well constructed visuals.END"
3,Colossus: The Forbin Project,This movie is presently only in Region 2. This means you will need a multi-regional DVD player to view this movie. Phillips has multi-regional DVD player from under $50. You can purshase the player on Amazon.com. Purchasing this DVD player will allow you to tap into movies that were not sold in our market. Well worth the money. Many great European and Asian movies never make it to this market.Also it's rumored on the web that Will Smith is in the process of remaking this movie. If it's anything like iRobot then it will be a winner.
4,Out dated now but great back then,"I remember seeing this movie as a kid and loved it. Since then, I've had a very hard time finding it in video (until Amazon came along - free plug). Now that I've seen it again, my opinion rests mostly on childhood memories. It has good acting and well written dialog but the special effects are just so outdated it takes down the rest of the movie. In addition, the plot is a little more outragous now that we're smarter about computers and just what they are capable of. I still like it ... just not as much as the fantasy."
5,Service review + brief abt film,"No problems whatsoever. Arrived promptly and in perfect condition.As for the actual film, it's part of what inspired Terminator and the Matrix series, being one of the first to examine the theme of an A.I we create taking over.The other film of note in this regard, again pre-terminator, is Demonseed."
1,How could you Universal Studio,"As others have mentioned, this isn't full widescreen, but instead pan and scan. But on top of that, the transfer looks incredibly grainy. Having seen the laser disc version, I just don't understand where they got this horrid version from.One of the most under rated and oft forgotten dystopian classics of the old style SciFi classics, ruined by a studio that feels fobbing the public off with such a shoddy transfer is acceptable. I'd return this lousy copy but I don't see how this is Amazon's fault. Universal Studio are 100% to blame for this horrible mistake.Please don't buy it."
1,Why not widescreen?,"I am starting to get annoyed that widescreen versions of movies are not being made available. The only choice being pan&scan. I have no problems with pan&scan for those that want it, but release a widescreen version as well. Especially when it is well know that this movie was released in a widescreen format. I will not buy this movie until a widescreen version is released."
5,Classic Sci-Fi,OK maybe a bit dated now but one of my favorite movies growing up and still holds up for the most part. Definitely one of the must see classic sci-fi movies. Plot? Think Skynet envisioned in the 60s
1,Not widescreen,"I got a chance to see an advance copy of this today, and to my disappointment, this DVD is a so-called ""Full Frame"" transfer (in other terms, Pan & Scan).Colossus: The Forbin Project was shot in 2.35:1 (I have it on laser disc in widescreen) so you will be losing more than half of the image on this version.What a shame! This is a classic SF movie, and it deserves to be seen as it was photographed. Sure, the price is low, but when you don't get the real film, so what? In any case, it may be reissued some day with in the special edition form it deserves, and then you'll have to buy it again. Purchase not recommended.""No widescreen, no sale!"""
2,Full-screen??? What's up with that?,"Colossus is one of my all time favorite science fiction movies. The movie inspired me to become a software developer, oh so many years ago. I missed it when it came out on laser disc and have been waiting patiently for the DVD release. My question to Universal is what were you thinking releaseing the movie in Pan 'n Scan? The movie was filmed in widescreen! Fans want it in widescreen. As another reviewer mentioned, if you must release it in Pan 'n Scan for those who feel they're losing something if the movie doesn't fill the screen, then at least release it with both formats. Other companies do it. Get with the program!!! I am giving this movie a low rating solely on the lack of a widescreen format. Otherwise, I would have rated it four stars (not the best movie I've ever seen, but like I said, one of my favorite.)"
2,"Well, at least it's not on VHS","Film gets a 4. DVD gets a 1.I own over 100 DVDs. This is far and away the worst DVD I own. It is worse than the original ""A Christmas Story"" DVD.Universal has released the worst DVD of the year for, sadly, one of the best 70s/cold-war flicks. The best thing I can say about this DVD is that the film is not on VHS.For starters, they didn't get the title right- Colossus: ""The Forbin"" project. OK, whatever. This attention to detail is representative of the entire DVD.Menu? Nope. You get chapters- amazingly enough- but I'd bet they were just generated by the mastering software. I can't say for certain though because there are no scene selections- because there's no menu. Load it in, and the DVD plays.The DVD has a screen that reads ""formatted to fit your TV"" which means they don't know about widescreen TVs yet. Thankfully, the opening credits are widescreen so you can read them. The rest of the film is pan and scan. The video transfer is lousy too- moire patterns abound."
3,great movied marred by poor DVD transfer (hope the remake fixes this),"This was a well-acted, well-produced movie that I had first seen in 35mm format in the 1980s. However, the DVD version lacks credibility as is not a widescreen version.Hopefully the remake project (written by Jason Rothenberg) will revive interest in the original and get a proper DVD tranfer. And I hope the Grazer/Howard production is as thought-provoking as the original."
2,Wrong Aspect Ratio for a great film,"I have to agree with other comments about this release. This is a very good sci-fi movie from the late 60's, but the impact is diminished because Universal decided to release it in a pan and scan version, which frankly sucks. I bought it without checking the aspect ratio which sucks even more. I hate it when a widescreen movie is redirected by a technician to fit a square format that very soon will be obsolete. Please Universal release a widescreen version of this sci-fi classic."
1,"4 Stars for a great film, -3 for Not Widescreen in 2012","I can't believe I didn't read the reviews which make it plain 8 years ago this is a ""Full Screen"" (4:3) edition of a widescreen movie, since the ad made no mention whatsoever regarding screen format.I'll eat the cheap price, and I'll enjoy seeing the movie again after 30 years, but the Amazon ad should have at least mentioned the Full Screen layout. Who sells 4:3 edition movies (that weren't full screen originally) these days? Jokers who want to make a fast buck, that's who. Amazon should be ashamed of itself.Sure, I'll keep buying from Amazon. But it won't be my first place to shop anymore, and a couple bucks' savings won't be enuff to wait a week for delivery."
3,"Great movie, wretched presentation","I feel that I should elaborate on the presentation of this film on DVD. Cramped fullscreen. No menus; it just runs on repeat. THE WORST box art I've seen for a movie from a major studio release, BY FAR. The disc is just the title printed haphazardly on white, and the kicker is that they misplaced the end quotation so the disc title is Colossus: ""The Forbin"" Project. The original title didn't have the quotes, so I'm just going to assume that some powerful higher-ups at Universal despise this film and everybody who loves it (like me). There's a double-feature laserdisc with Silent Running that might be in widescreen, but probably the best use of your time would be to get a VHS and just assume it will be in fullscreen and not have special features. What a travesty."
4,A Sci-Fi With A Twist,"Even though Eric Braeden did a wonderful job of acting, this was clearly an off-the-wall sci-fi that Charlton Heston should have started in. Colossus reminded me of sci-fi's like: Omega Man, Soilent Green, and a few other movies with an odd twist. Nevertheless... a good movie to watch, and one for the library.Thomas"
1,Best movie with no conclusion I've ever seen,"OK, I'm a SciFi fan. I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end. Just one problem, they forgot to write the end. What happened? Did they run out of money? Did the writer write himself into a corner? There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution. You can argue till you are blue in the face about ""pan & scan."" I prefer movies with an ending. If you are looking for a great unfinished story, this one is for you."
1,this book is just like the rest lately...Disappointing,"I swore to myself I would not read another DS book again but there I went the lure of a DS book in the shelves was to much for me so I went ahead and bought it. (Can I get a refund?) Ms. Steel your books lately don't come close to what your first books were. The Ring, Zoya, those were, are classics. You didn't spend chapters talking about closets or how much money they had or what the wine tasted like. You truly made us care about the characters. I suggest you take a real break and go back to the reason you became a #1 bestselling author. I know authors don't like to read bad reviews but this is a cry for the good stuff. We miss the Daniel Steel that brought us Message from Nam, No Greater Love. What have you done with her?"
1,The worst book I've read this year,"I have read a lot of DS books and this is the worst one yet. It was repetitive; the story was totally mundane, not even a little bit intriguing and the ending predictable. I read it to the end hoping it was going to get better but it never did. For a writer of her caliber and reputation she ought to know better. The only good point - it didn't take long to read. This is the last DS book I'll ever buy."
2,Doesn't she have an editor?!?,"Like several other reviewers, I found this repetitive and rambling. It is also very poorly edited, full of comma splices and run-on sentences - overall, extremely annoying. She can be a good story teller, but over the last few years they are more and more poorly written.The books read as if she just tells a story into a tape recorder, and no one cleans them up at all. Second Chances was one of the worst, and this story wasn't good enough to distract from the poor sentence construction, etc. The book seemed like just another she churned out to meet a publishing quota.One more pet peeve: I despise such long chapters with no breaks within them. Although I read a great deal - at least a dozen books a month - I seldom have time to read one of her whole chapters at one sitting, and I prefer having a real ""stopping place""."
1,Not her best,"So far I have read all of Danielle Steel's books and have kept every single one of them in hardcover. I look forward to reading Impossible and Miracle soon. But I just didn't care for the character of Fiona at all. Not my type of person so I didn't care for reading about her at any cost. I loved the character of John; he's a doll! Fiona was nothing but a self centered, self absorbed woman who thought only of herself and how she can constantly benefit herself. I have no idea what John saw in her; I guess it was her beauty. Talk about total opposites! I don't blame his daughters for disliking her! The other women in Danielle's books were much nicer and had much better personalities. Because of Fiona, I didn't enjoy the book at all. I couldn't wait to finish it. I was hoping that he would leave her altogether and find someone more to his liking. Unfortunately he stuck by her."
4,Typical DS!!,"I am a big fan of Danielle Steel. If you are a fan you know that the ending is predictable. It follows the usual format of romance as is her custom.It is a look into the world of women whose entire lives are wrapped around their jobs. Fiona lived, ate and enjoyed her job, her single life and all of the trappings. Meeting John was fun but love had a stronger tug despite Fiona's resistance to say no. Fiona had a very difficult road ahead as she wanted to know John's daughters but their resistance to her was even stronger.It is a great summer read and a quick one!"
3,A bit disappointing.....,"I was very eager to read this book and did in 2 days time..but it was a bunch of whining and fighting. I didn't care much for Fiona, a spoiled. selfish, unbending woman, or John, a pushy widower with two spoiled brat kids. All we seemed to dwell on in this book was the lack of closet space in Fiona's house....BOY...what a crisis...she couldn't marry a man because she'd have to give up her closet space!!!! And John kept pushing her to marry him and then when she did...he expected things to go his way. Two spoiled selfish people in the book...neither willing to bend for the other. Sorry, Danielle, but you'll have to do better to earn my 5 stars!"
2,Boooring,"Disappointing. I love Danielle Steel's writing, but the problem with Second Chance is that I couldn't bring myself to care one bit about Fiona, so I finished reading the book after skipping over large parts of it, because it was so boring. You might want to save yourself the five bucks and just skip this one entirely, no matter how much of a DS fan you are."
2,Not Her Best Work,"I have been reading Danielle Steel books for years. While most of the endings are fairly predictable, the stories themselves set you up to really be engrossed in the world of the characters and really be sad when you finish the book.This book was short, so I finished it in about a day. It is the first book that I can honestly say I didn't really enjoy of hers. I felt the storyline moved pretty unrealistically, and while the ending was predictable, I didn't feel the quick and easy ending did the story or the characters justice.I will continue to read her books, but this definitely will not have a place in my library and will soon be going to a used bookstore."
4,Informative Book,"This was the third ""how to"" book I have read and this one really does help! The other books I read on this subject were terribly written and the author was just trying to sell stuff from his mail order business. Not this book! The author really explains how to get things going and she presents the information in a well written organized manner. I just finished this book and I now know where to start. Other books are just direct mailers this book really informs you."
1,very underwhelming,"I bought this book since it had the perfect-sounding title. When I got it home and started thumbing through it, i realized it has some glaring omissions. For example, in the list of options for business structure, it omits LLC. Also it barely glosses over the arduous process for getting a merchant account to be able to accept credit cards. These are both very important issues that should be addressed!!"
2,Very Basic Information,"I recommend this book to anybody who knows nothing about starting business in General. It gives you very basic information on Marketing, Inventory Control and Accounting, thats all. Oh yes, it also gives you some of the advantages of a home based business."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"I bought this spiral bound book prior to taking the introduction to reading test. The copyright date is 2007; however, almost all of the questions are outdated and not truly reflective of questions on the actual test. National Learning Corporation needs to revise this study guide and take this version off the market!!!! It is actually filled with questions that use the words, ""retarded"", and has question formats that are NOT on the test. Did they just use the same old crap from 1970 and repackage it to sell the book? Don't waste your time or money."
1,Not Satisfied.,"I bought this booking thinking it was going to be a good study guide to The Introduction to Reading Praxis Exam. While reading I realized how difficult the material seemed to be. The information contained a lot of statistics, theories, researchers and other items that were new to me and I had never learned in my reading classes in college. When I took the exam I learned that none of the material from this book was included on the test."
4,This CD is cool,"This was the first Bosstones CD I bought and it's pretty cool. Even though some of the songs are so-so, songs like ""kinder words"" and ""jump through the hoops"" are really great ska-punk songs. This may not be the greatest punk album but it is still pretty good."
4,One of the few disks I can listen to from start to finish,"Question the Answers is one of the few disks in my collection that I can listen to from start to finish. Maybe less aggressive than some Bosstones albums, but a classic none-the-less. This is a staple in my car at all times. I love how raw Dicky's voice is on this disk and the guitar sounds are among the best ever recorded."
5,Dicky's Voice RULES,"Don't listen that punk, he's probably not even heard of the 'Tones. This CD is awesome. Kinder Words kicks and Toxic Toast is the absolute best song ever. Dog's and Chaplains is awesome too, so buy this great CD."
4,Ehhh...,"Some reviewers are right. If you loved Let's Face It you might miss this one completely. I did the first time I heard it...Question the Answers is an eclectic mix of ska and hardcore punk/metal. Slight funk and Latin influences also are present in the music. If you'd like an example, listen to ""Desensitized"" on Let's Face It. The majority of songs are like that, only slower and heavier. The heavy guitar and bass sometimes ruins the album's mood, however. Hearing upbeat ska horns against downtuned metal riffing is not the most pleasing listen. Needless to say, the Bosstones are very tight musicians, and as a band, they are very strong--but the music just doesn't 'work'.Highlights are ""Kinder Words,"" ""A Sad Silence,"" ""Hell Of A Hat,"" ""Stand Off,"" ""Toxic Toast,"" and ""Jump Through The Hoops."" Note that that's only half the CD. It's only MY opinion, however...The Mighty Mighty Bosstones still rule!"
5,Single Best Bosstones' CD Ever!,"All Bosstones' fans can appreciate this CD. Whether you're an old-school Bosstones fan or your the new ""Let's Face It"" Bosstones fan, you'll love this CD. I myself like the older ""ska-core"" Bosstones and the newer ""sell-out"" Bosstones. I like both versions of the Bosstones, so I REALLY enjoy this CD. Not one weak song on the entire album!"
2,Their worst outing ever,simply put the worst MMBT CD released. If you own everything else of theirs and need more then by all means be dissapointed.
1,The singer's voice sounds like crap,"I'm a big-time ska fan and I do like the Mighty Mighty Bosstones. I bought this cd when I started to get into ska a couple years ago. It was MMBT latest cd at the time. I liked maybe one or two songs, but the rest sucks. His voice sounds so bad on this cd that I couldn't even listen to the songs, even though the music part was ok. His voice ruins the songs and this cd. That my opinion . . ."
4,Nice socks,"Nice color and pattern. Appears to be very well made and sturdy. Elastic is comfortable. Great price, I'd buy more if other colors were available."
5,Happy customer!,"All the books I ordered are for my grandchild. I really looked at the reviews. Very helpful! Thank you.So, I did not read the books myself. However, I heard that my grandson liked them and wanted to take them to his school.I am very glad to hear that.The delivery came very quick and it was Christmas time!! I am a happy customer!"
4,solid title in great series,"I grew up reading TinTin and was excited to share the adventures with my sons. This title is a little off the high mark of other TinTin books but it is still a good read. I agree with another reviewer that it helps to read some of the other books to know more about the secondary characters, but it will not detract from the story."
4,Great Soundtrack but....,"I agree with Sarah's review....this is a great soundtrack. Much like the ""Menace II Society"" and ""Mo Money"" soundtracks, the music is better than the movie itself. I do like ""Little Girl Blue"" by Caron Wheeler and the CD feels incomplete without it. I've been going through my basement weeding out any tapes that I ended up buying on CD over the years and just don't have the room for any longer and had to remember to keep the cassette version of this just for the one song. I guess back when this came out they could fit more on tape then cd. In any even, good songs, solid release, and if you're a fan of a mix of R&B, Soul, and Hip-Hop then this is a great compilation even above just being a soundtrack."
5,Great CD,"This movie is one of my favorite movies, and I saw it the other day, and I loved the music in it, so I instantly got in Amazon to see if they had it, and they did..lucky me..I have burned this CD to my PC and then I added it to my ipod, I absolutely love it, and even though I bought this CD used, it does not have any scratches on it, great conditon."
3,promising Debut,"Having studied under Mary LaChappelle, I know her to be a warm, smart, perceptive individual. I also know that her more recent writing (yet to be published, sadly...)is superior to most of the pieces collected here. She knows this, too. That said, the title story is brilliant and worth the price of this book alone--it is one of those sad, piercing tales that sticks with the reader for years. In other words, it is a perfect short story. Some of the other works collected here too readily reveal the author's mind and pen at work, lurching and jerking along with very little insight and far too much forced whimsy. I'd recommend this book, but only for about three of the stories."
5,WELL DONE WELL WORTH IT,A GOOD SOLID READ. KEPT ME UP A FEW NIGHTS! THE STORY WAS GOOD AND MAKES ONE HOPE THE GOVT. KEEPS THE BLACKBIRD AROUND. WELL WORTH THE MONEY. BUY IT.
2,Bulwer-Lytton Award,"Good, if predictable, story, but terrible writing - I think 9 out of 10 sentences contains a cliche. ""It was a dark and stormy night..."""
4,Not bad - but not great.,The bottle seems to be fine - no problems with stopper as I've had on others. But the fleece cover is rather thin compared to some plush covers - I had expected something fancier. Rather expensive for what it is.
1,Not So Hot,"This hot water bag should be called a warm water bag. Though I fill it with boiling water, it simply does not emit heat. It is well made and the fleece is cozy, but the essence of the bag is a flop. I did a lot of searching and thought the Germans would produce a good quality HOT bag, but this is not the case. I spent a few weeks in Ireland this summer, and each night my hostess gave us all a 'hottie"" to warm our beds. The ""hottie was still hot in the morning. That's the kind of bag I wanted"
5,Warms it up,I liked this product. I use it to warm up my baby's crib mattress before I put him to bed. It does it really well. The night sky theme is really nice and matches the rest of his nursery. I like that the inner bottle cap is plastic as well. Overall I am very happy with it.
4,Mother loves this.,It's a little bit smaller than I thought but a lovely gift for someone who doesn't feel so well. Lots of covers to choose from.
3,Disappointed!!!!,"Couldn't do it!! Stopped trying to get into it at Chapter 17. You know those books that get ya at the first or very latest second chapter.....well this still hadn't even come close to gettin me at Chapter 17. Sorry, I tried. Boring and no action!!!"
3,Not My Favorite,There wasn't a lot of songs on here that I really connected to like in Toby's other albums. I still would recommend adding it to your collection if you are die hard Toby fan there's a few really good tracks on it.
2,Not very good,"I got this on recommendation from a friend. Although I like Country Western music in the older styles of Willie Nelson and George Jones, I was kind of turned off by this one. I just found the lyrics to be rather silly and juvenile and although Toby has a good voice and can play guitar well, it just was not to my liking. I would recommend later releases likeUnleashedandShock'n Y'allwhich are much stronger CD's of his and have more bang for the buck."
3,Solid Country Music,"Solid Country music, but there are not so many highlights. I like this Kind of music for driving with the car."
3,Not the usual Parker line on psychology,"Well, if you're gonna write about shrinks all the time in your thrillers, you might as well have one where they're central to the plot. That's what Mr. Parker does here, and the result is actually pretty entertaining. I especially liked the fact that the featured shrink is memorably evil. It really kept the pages turning!"
1,a stinker,"at approx 50 words per page,and very few pages. However,the large print made for a fast read"
4,A step up,"I gave a fairly negative review of the last Sunny Randall, Perish Twice. I liked this one a lot more. Parker is still working out his relationships, but this one was more interesting. The smart-mouthing didn't dominate the story, and I enjoyed the interplay of the psychiatric moves. Also thought it was one of Parker's best titles re: content."
2,Mediocre at Best,"I really cannot recommend Shrink Rap, for a number of reasons. There is not much to the story, the narrative voice is an unconvincing female and the plot gets ridiculous toward the end. The only positive thing I have to say is it is certainly a quick read."
1,woof-woof,"Robert Parker's Shrink Rap is a dog. As a long-time fan of Parker's - I've read 'em all and enjoyed most of them - I found Shrink Rap to be silly, contrived, sexist, and banal - and that's the good parts. This book shows the sign of too much success and not enough effort on the part of the author. After a good start - a successful woman is being stalked by a dangerous ex-husband and hires Sunny Randall to provide security - the novel simply whirls down the drain through some really messy plotting into a totally unsatisfying ending. This thing smacks of the typess of sicko fantasy a demented pre-adolescent might dream up. Go back to what you know, Bob! If Spenser had a problem like this, it would be a subplot in a better novel, because he or Hawk would dispense some street-corner justice and the ex-husband would be on the first bus out of town - as soon as he got out of the hospital. If the next one's this bad, no more Sunny Randall for me!"
1,"Dissapointed,sadly...","I've been reading Robert Parker since 1987,and this is the first time i was truely dissapointed...Sadly.There is way too much psychobabble in here for me,obviouslysome will disagree.I found myself falling asleep too easily.It was boring.I miss the RBP of old,Spenser and Hawk,the good old days.It's a KINDER GENTLER Robert Parker,where everything ispsycho-analyzed....It started with Spenser's Susan,now it's gone to other characters.I hope the Next Spenser or Jesse Stone is better,i don'twant to give up on him..Maybe he's just mellowing with age..i don't know.Advice..a little less conversation,a little more action(Elvis)."
1,Almost made me crazy!,"I listened to this book, and I regretted that within the first ten minutes. The constant use of ""she said"" or ""he said"" for every single line of dialogue almost made me roll down my car windows and scream like a banshee. Not only that, but the story was sexist and contrived and, well, rather stupid. This was the first book I ever picked up by this author, and I can't see buying anymore if this is any indication. Give me James Patterson or Patricia Cornwell for murder mysteries any day."
3,Breaking Free,"At least I hope that is what Parker is allowing the ex-husband to do. As far as selfish goes, this character is by far much worse than Susan Silverman. And why on earth would a tiny woman who is constantly seeking male help try to be a private eye in the first place?"
5,Loved it. Love the Sunny Randall series.,"Not even going to try and go into detail. It's a Robert Parker mystery, enough said. Have completed the Sunny Randall books, have a good start on the Spencer and the Stone series and have accumulated most of the westerns but am waiting to read them untill I have them all (not too many in that run). Love them all. Good, fun, mysteries with excellent witty dialogue; sometimes philosophical sometimes nonsensical, but actual dialogue. Film buffs watch the Thin Man movies and Bogie's tough guy noir films - book buffs read Robert B. Parker."
1,Worst of All,"I've read many of Parker's books and used to be an avid fan. This book seems to be one where Parker lost interest after writing the first page. Many details are utterly superfluous and seem to be fillers to enlarge the book. The plot is silly, and the characters are inane. I know Parker can write well. I wish he would do so all the time and forget about putting out books en masse without serious editing."
4,Sunny's fun to be with,"So far, I can't say that any of the Sunny Randall books have hit the high point that some Spenser novels have. But I find the three of them consistently good.SHRINK RAP does differ somewhat from your basic Parker story. It's one of the few that doesn't bring in organized crime figures. The principle bad guy is believingly creepy enough that he doesn't need gangster help. He does have a couple of confederates, and again, they are sleazy enough, and somehow more menacing than any of Joe Broz' or Tony Morris' hoods.As others point out, the disguise element doesn't convince. This evil character sure isn't going to be convinced by Sunny's disguise, and I'm afraid I'm not either.However, this book delivers what one expects from Parker...a quick entertaining straight-line read which while mainly diversion still has enough thought provoking elements to satisfy the intelligent reader."
2,Parker at his most lame,"I agree whole heartedly with the recent reviewer who advises us not to put Parker's works in the same league as the classics. However, just as there is good, enjoyable, challenging popular entertainment (be it in books, TV, pop music, theater or film) there is also subpar popular entertainment that wastes the consumer's time. I also agree whole heartedly with the other reviewers who thought that the plot in this book strains credibility and that the dialog and behavior of Sunny, Spike, Julie, the villainous doctor, etc., are just as difficult to accept. Just as Neil Simon isn't Shakespeare, audiences still have a right to quality entertainment from him. Fans of Parker's Jesse Stone and Spenser expect a certain level of craftsmanship from him, and this time he doesn't deliver."
4,Parker's best Sunny Randall Novel,"Despite plot devices that are bit too unbelievable, this is the first Sunny Randall novel I've actually liked. This is the first novel where Parker explores Sunny's character in more than simply superficial terms, giving her a life of her own beyond simply being ""Spenser in drag.""Here we find Sunny hired by a popular novelist as a bodyguard because her ex-husband is stalking her. The ex-husband also happens to be a manipulative psychiatrist preying on women. In getting to the bottom of the ""case"" Sunny begins to explore her own feelings, which begin to reveal a lot about her personality -as do her actions throughout.Parker fans should enjoy this one..."
2,Parker is coasting,"If this was the first book I had read by Robert B.Parker, it would be the last. But I keep reading each as they come out, because if the excellence of his early work. Nobody believes the silly disguise, silly plot in this one.Read it for the usual Parker sparkling dialogue. It is a very short book. Maybe Parker is tired."
2,Mildly amusing,"Sunny Randall must spend her time reading Stephanie Plum mysteries. There is no whacky grandmother in this story, but other than that it is pretty much a Janet Evanovich [clone]. Parker's novel read like a movie script in that they are almost all diologue. They also have more white space than a serious writer should be willing to foist on the public. There is really no mystery in this novel just a story of bringing a known stalker to a form of justice by your basically neurotic woman private detective."
5,Great,"I love Robert B Parker and this is a great book of his. If you like his other books, you will enjoy this one."
1,Worst Yet,"After reading 50 or 60 Parker books, and enjoying most of them, this was a huge disappointment. ""Shrink Wrap"" is a disaster. Unbelievable. Uninteresting. The thing that surprised me most is that I finished the thing."
4,Sunny Randall series from Robert B. Parker,"I enjoy a good mystery, Robert B. Parker does a good job of entertaining the reader. Sunny is hired to serve as bodyguard for a book author on tour who is being stalked by her psychotherapist/ex-husband. Sunny must find a way to get the low-down on him and find a way to remove him from being a threat to herself and her client. Along the way you meet Sunny's quirky family and friends that try to help her and provide a bit of personal drama.... including Rosie, Sunny's English bull terrier.The Sunny Randall series of books are ""a lighter fare"", but still quite interesting. With the love-interest thread in the series I have gotten my wife interested in reading them. I enjoy the characters he has created. Shrink Rap is as good as the rest of the series that I have read. It is a fast read, funny and predictable. Give it a try!"
3,training for ballet music,"good sound and recording.Most pieces are an adaption of well known classical music from operas and concerts.Sometimes strange timings. For my purpose to have additional longer pieces of music for advanced ballet students it is ok. Thank you for sending it so quickly and perfectly packed, Hannelore Imig-Jayasundara"
5,"It ain't no toy, just a nice model, premade.","I play World of Tanks Online. I always look for premade models of my favorite tanks. I have a German Tiger model, and love it. This model looks like the Russian IS3 in the game. I guess this is a real ""geek"" toy..... love it."
5,apert syndrome,"i haven't read the book yet, but am purchasing a copy. i can say, having someone in my family who has apert syndrome, i find offensive the description of an apert person. however, i will give the book a chance. i just wanted to let everyone out there know that if they would like to learn more about apert syndrome they can feel free to visit www.apert.org . there are lots of pictures and descriptions of different surgeries. i just have to wonder what connection to apert syndrome the author has, considering the rarity of it. i hope everyone takes a look so they might better understand before they judge.jenni"
1,YAWN! Strickly amateur hour.,"Mr. Wagner writes like the most clever boy in the Beverly Hills High School english class. He is obsessed with superficiality, has nothing to say, and is too pretentious to even be fun. Strictly ""amateur hour."""
3,beautiful until it tries to stop,"Two thirds of this book are awesome. The story is epic, and the writing is sharp, sharp, sharp. Wagner builds a great network of fanciful characters that are connected in perhaps a few too many ways for realism, and he somehow tethers this impossibly colorful structure to reality nonetheless, with an amazing glue of sparkling wit and painful grit. For a few hundred pages it's captivating, and then the unlikely interconnections amongst the characters become so numerous that even the very real pains they endure, as well as the pleasures Wagner's writing gave to this reader at least, are not enough to keep the whole tangle from collapsing into itself and rolling out into space. It's a shame I can't just recommend the first part of the book--the last portion really soured it for me, but a story needs an ending. Still, if you do read this, you'll probably come out ahead."
4,They Realy Got Me.,"Tom Keifer are good songwritter & vocalist. This album include best song that Tom write ""Hard To Find The Words"". So if you like glam music buy it."
4,I saw Cinderellas last night in San Antonio,"Man what a great live show. This band sounds as they did twenty years ago. The setlist and their catalog are tops. If you get a chance to see them live, do so. Very few bands can perform the way Cinderella does live and they are well worth seeing."
1,STILL FALLING,"Forget it. CINDERELLA will never be curd of their mediocrity in writing rock songs. THis album adds nothing to their horrible ""discography"". Blergh !"
2,Weekend at Bernies in Old England.....,"This is a somewhat implausible guardian/ward romance set in the 1783 Yorkshire England. Our heroine Gillian Ellicott is made a ward (is that even possible at 20 yrs old?) of Calum Marquess of Iolar, when her father unexpectedly dies.I found this romance novel difficult to get into. Gillian was an immature woman, whose 'hijinks' became annoying after a while. Calum Marquess of Iolar speaks like an extra from Braveheart... ""Och, weel, we know what that means doona we lassie?""I found myself skimming the second half of the book. I just couldn't get into it, and I found Calum's dialect distracting. Perhaps others might persevere where I have failed."
2,Stickers Not Sturdy,"Recently, I purchased this item, as well as two smaller Dover sticker booklets. I was disappointed with them. They are only somewhat reusable. As another letter-writer noted, they lose the stickiness. They also are flimsy, made of paper with a coating; they tore easily when handled and curled up when removed from the first place where they were placed. I hoped to purchase a product similar to ColorForms of years past. Not the case. While the idea is a good one for play and learning, these just aren't sturdy enough for rehandling."
4,Confusing in it's brilliance,"This movie was a beautiful yet dark glipmse into the lives of poetic greats. Though confusing at times, the cinematography was completely amazing-sometimes eerie. This film has the ability to engulf you, and the acting is excellent. This was an engaging, thought provoking film. The only negative aspect is that at times it gets a little confusing, however overall, an excellent, unique film."
4,Let's get high and write some poems,"I watched this movie in one of my classes and I loved it. I did not know that John Hannah was in it, and when I saw him in it I knew I would like it. It is a crazy drug adventure that is beautifully done. If you liked Fear & Loathing you will enjoy this movie, if not...don't bother. No, the movie is not historically accurate. I don't think they wanted it to be, but what they did do is make a great movie. The dialogue is great, and the acting superb."
5,"Great, poetic variation from historical accuracy","Ok, so it plays a lot with the truth, but it does have fun and in its fiction, reveals some essential truths to a modern audience an historically accurate version could not possibly hope to.The movie never leaves its 'modern sensibility as subtext' even as it embraces the nuances and detail of late-18th/early 19th century England.The acting is great, the photography beautiful, the plot fun: actually, the more you know, the funnier this is, and I think intentionally so."
1,Pandaemonium--Dumb and Dumber,"This movie is stunning in its stupidity. The writers are obviously incapable of even the dimmest understanding of the work of either Wordsworth or Coleridge. In their ignorance they must fall back upon a stereotypical pastiche bearing virtually no resemblance to the history or character of either poet. The legacy of these two literary giants offers a rich tapestry to exploit. Yet here we have an offering which might be summed up in one sentence as follows. ""Drugs--wow, man cool, no drugs?--bummer."""
4,just what we were looking for,"Lots of dragons to choose from - this one is just the right size, and sturdy, so should hold up with lots of play."
5,Red Dragon,"I purchased this dragon to use in play with the Imaginex Castle. It is lightweight, not too big and easy to handle. It is well detailed and different from the green dragon that I purchased, also."
2,Not the best quality,"The wings of this dragon seem to be glued on poorly. If a child were to play with it, they would easily break."
1,"Waste of money, avoid Safari ltd.","Would never have imagined that Amazon would allow cheap dollar sore toys to be sold through their services. I've purchased many items from Amazon and expectations have always been met or exceeded, with this birthday present purchase I was grossly disappointed. And to add one insult to another to be charged $5.00 shipping on top the $8.00+ that this tiny little plastic toy that probably cost less than 25 to make, unbelievable! Shame on you Amazon, and shame on Safari ltd.! It's too bad ripoff artists have the ability to take advantage of people via reputed trustworthy retail websites. Wish I could have rated 0 stars."
1,"Teeny, Tiny dragon","This dragon is the size of something you would expect to find in a kid's meal package. I paid $14 for this?? Even though I have to pay money to return it, at least I'll get some of my money back. I see it's now selling for about $5 - I'm not sure it's worth that, but if I only paid $5, I wouldn't bother sending it back.Of course, my fault for not looking closer at the size...lesson learned!"
5,Perfect Dragon,"Bought this to go with my 3 yr old's castle. He loves it. I wasn't sure if spending $8 on a plastic dragon was necessary, but it's by far his favorite castle accessory. The details are fabulous & it's the perfect size for his little hands."
3,Robert Taylor was very funny,"Interesting, not very close to historicaly correct.ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok"
4,excellent quality,"this cable does what its supposed to do, higher quality image. games look much better and dvd movies even better"
4,Undiscovered Gem!,"I just watched this movie on AMC and was pleasantly surprised. The opening shot of the film had me hooked. Watching this film it was easy to see that it undeniably had to be influential in the art direction and cinematography for the ripper film ""From Hell"" (2001), and even for the opening scene in ""Time After Time"" (1979). This film presents a pretty interesting whodunit story with great acting, great suspense, and great visuals. It also finishes out the story with a pulse-pounding finale. The murder scenes and the (for it's time) blatant sexuality of the ""ladies of the evening"" garnered it an X rating in the United Kingdom. The film has fine performances, an intelligent script with good dialogue, good humor, and plenty of action. Frankly, I found it to be as relevant, compelling, and as solid as any thriller made today. I was unaware of this film until tonight. Now I'm anxious to add it to my collection on DVD. Highly recommended for fans of the genre. Cheers!"
3,Ok obscure thriller.,"I like these kind of movies generally speaking, old obscure mysteries. This movie is from 1959. This one is about another Jack the Ripper typs killer in London. This was shot in glorious and gritty black and white & loads up on atmosphere. It wont be the best film ever but it is a decent effort and will appeal to those that like the Edgar Wallace Mysteries and other obscure who done its.The DVD from Sinister Cinema isnt bad, a nice average print and contains the color sequence at the end of the movie. I think it is one of those movies to watch on a gray, foggy Saturday mornings and watch this in bed wrapped in a blanket. Worth checking out for those into these kind of movies.."
3,Not as deep as you expect,This is like a introductory book to Triads. Telling a history of them and and explaining how to destory this threat. The Book doesn't show much updated infomation except from the perspective of Elite Hong Kong Police Officers.
3,Only ONE Song From Funhouse?,"The fact that there is only ONE song from the Stooges 2nd album says a lot, which isn't good. I mean how COULD they leave off ""1970"" or even ""T.V. Eye."" What were they thinking? This alone keeps it from my giving it a four star rating. Other greast songs not included ""Pumping For Jill,""""Loco Mosiquito,""Bang, Bang (which Bowie did a terrible cover of). I mean who put this together? This is NOT the definitive Iggy Pop anthology, but it will have to do for now. Best to make your own compilation, because this one falls way short."
3,Starts great then gets lame and then redeems again at the end,"This Anthology demonstrates Iggy's career perfectly. He started off brilliantly as a Stooge. He initated the punk rock movement with his raw hard edges music and unpredictable stage performance and antics. Then he cleaned up in the 80s and 90s and put out a bunch of forgetable glam pop Bowie influenced garabage. Then finally, he redeemed himself and came back to roots with Beat Em Up and Skull Ring. So, this Anthology is just like his career, it starts off awesome, then it sucks for a long time and then finally its great again."
1,worthless,"was told by someone who has a lot of pain it was wonderful stuff. I put it on and nothing!! It smells cool but thats it. It didnt get cool or hot Its basically blue lotion. I wish I had not wasted my 21.00, could have used the money for something useful."
4,great product,"Product is very effective in relieving pain and discomfort of arthritis when applied. Easy to apply, product received promptly, well packaged, I would recommend Super Blue Stuff to anyone. Ordered through Amazon.com"
4,Super Blue Stuff Pain Relief Cream,I thought I'd give this product a try for my worn out shoulder and soreness. Hey... it really helps! The relief is not instant. You will have to use it a couple times at night before bed time before you actually notice any difference. I have arthritis setting in (getting old is a pain... Ha Ha) and it helps relieve the soreness in my wrist and knees too. I give a good recommendation for this product.
3,it works,"my brother told me about this. when visting him . so when got home I order . some like it . it doesn't makeyou smell bad. but the effect doesn't last as long, as I hoped.thank youteresa"
2,not what I thought it was,"Around 2001, there were a couple of British guys arrested in Saudi Arabia for some car bombings in Riyadh. They claimed they were innocent, but the Saudis claimed they were rival alcohol smugglers.This book is an account of that, written by one of the accused, with a guest writer helping him.I had thought this book was more about Saudi Arabia in general, kind of an overall denunciation, but it is not. It is the story of one of the accused, Sandy Mitchell, from his point of view."
4,Helpful tool for electrical machine problems,I found that this book is a very useful source for solving problems related to elctrical machines. It provides clear and easy to follow instructions that are well laid out and easy to follow. It offers a varying level of problems ranging from the fundamentals through to the more complex machine problems. This is a useful aid or reference for anyone looking for a book to help them in their studies and wants to have more practice at solving problems relating to this subject.
4,Great book,"I bought the book to follow my electromechanics class, and until now it has been in sync with the class. Like other schaum's books it go strait to what matters, time isn't wasted on theoretical deductions."
5,"TinTin series, great read for boys! (and girls!)","The TinTin series were favorites of my two sons, now in their 20's. They gobbled down these books as fast as we could find them. TinTin was written in the 1930's-50's and is a fun way to learn basic world geography and light history. TinTin books left my sons eager to read more on certain historical time periods or countries. Don't miss these! Nice cartoonish illustrations as well."
1,Business to Business Marketing Textbook,"This book is tedious. The subject itself is very interesting so, if you are lucky like I was and you get a good Professor, then it will be OK. Just keep up with the review questions and you will be fine.The context itself feels repetitive at points and is not easy to read (coming from someone who usually has no problem reading, whether it be literature, textbooks or media)). Information is thrown at you (as can be expected in a textbook) in large, complex sentences full of lengthy examples that could be easily condensed, improving comprehensibility for students.Business to Business Marketing: Analysis and Practice in a Dynamic Environment"
4,Great Travel Size Skincare Product,I really like the Skin Smoothing Cream as it has extract of egg whites in it. The facial wash is very light and makes my face feel clean without drying it out. The toner is awesome! Botanical ingredients in a spray bottle -quite refreshing!
5,I love it!,"This is the best product ever!, it was recomended to me by a professional and it has helped my skin tremendously."
5,Vital Part Of My Move To Lutheranism,"This small catechism, though not a deal clencher on its own, certainly played a vital role in my move from the contemporary American evangelical movement to the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. If you're looking for solid teaching on the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, The Apostles Creed, the Lord's Supper, baptism, and Confession and Absolution, then the writing in this book will aid you along very nicely. For those who desire a deeper look at the Lutheran Confessions I would recommend purchasing a copy of the Book of Concord, which has a copy of the Small and Large Catechisms. That said, I highly recommend this version of the small catechism as it's nice to have as a resource when questions come up."
5,A replacement of something important,Great to have Luther's Small Catechism again. It was shipped very quickly and arrived in perfect condition. Thank you.
5,Love it....,"A great follow up with CPH's excellent tradition of putting out very good standard editions of Luther's catechisms with explanatory notes. Just perfect for instruction, complete with good clear Bible texts and thorough handling of the issues. Great for those preparing to go further in their walk with the Lord."
5,Like this version,I bought this for my husband as he has decided to join the Lutheran Church with me. I wasnot sure of it as I am used to the old blue book without all the explanations but was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful summaries of the content which explained things quite well. Highly recommend to all.
3,funny series,"this book was the third in the ""richest gals in texas"" series. It was not as charming as the other two. Quick and easy to read it will uplift anyone in a slump"
1,No support here,This product was a BIG disappointment. Did it provide support? No. It compressed after just a few days' use and is totally useless. I might give it to the neighbor's dog to play with because frankly that's all it's good for.
2,"Cheesy strap, too stiff for smaller people",The elastic strap isn't strong enough to keep the pillow in one place; it rolls up and down and you constant have to adjust it between your back and the chair. In order for it to sit correctly you have to tighten it so much that the elastic is sure to wear out in a matter of weeks. This model is too too stiff for those of us with smaller/lighter frames (it doesn't compress enough under my weight for my upper and lower back to come even close to the back of the chair).
2,Huge,This roll is huge and pushes me way too far forward. As an average sized woman I can't see using this size roll in any kind of seat unless it was really concave and wide.
3,It's okay after a little customization,"Initially, i didn't like this product. The roll was just too hard, and the foam was so large that I couldn't use any part of the chair back to support my back. so it didn't 't work for extended periods of sitting. However, I customized it by taking a knife and cutting off about 2/3 of the foam, making it more stable while wrapped around the back of my chair, and also smaller to suit my needs. I do agree with many reviewers that the elastic strap that holds the roll in place is of inferior quality -- mine has lost so much elasticity that it's useless and will need to be replaced with a better quality strap."
1,Worst ever lumbar role!,This roll is absolutely unusable. This lumbar roll is filled with foam and it changes its shape with pressure. It does not server its purpose as lumbar roll's must be slightly firm so that the arch in your back is maintained. I used this lumbar roll and stressed our my back muscles because of irregular sitting using this roll. I went to the physical therapist and they said that this is a low quality roll and gave me a much better one for little more than this price but it serves my purpose well. Do not buy this roll if you sit for long hours or have back pain. This roll does not help.
1,Squished and Limp,"After a week on my chair this thing was out of round and the strap could not keep it on my chair. It falls down and is misshapen, hardly of use. I wish I had bought something else because this thing is hardly even usable now. Spend your money on something else and you'll be better off."
3,WOrks well,"Works well, strap burst off the the roll after a few months however, but I still use the roll standalone against my chair in the office., Has helped my back a fair amount."
2,get original lumbar roll instead,I found this too thick to fit comfortably but did like the original mckenzie lumbar roll. I would get that instead.
2,Not long enough,"I use it when driving. It's too short. If it's not perfectly centered, I can feel the edge of the pillow (kind of) digging into my back. It doesn't hurt, but it's annoying. I have to continually reach behind me (while sitting in the driver's seat) to center the pillow. If it were longer, like 16 inches, I wouldn't have to keep reaching behind me (while driving) to adjust it. Also, the zipper handle occasionally comes up and that too digs into my back. Again, when that happens, I have to awkwardly reach behind me to adjust it. I guess they make it short to scrimp on costs. BTW, I'm not a big person (5' 11, 170 lbs), so I'm surprised more people haven't mentioned this. Aside from its length issue, the pillow is well constructed. No complaints in that regard. It's still firm after a year or two of use. Because it's too short (for me), I'm giving it two stars."
2,doesn't stay in place,It's tough to keep this in place on your chair - it slides around and is a bit uncomfortable. Wish I'd purchased something w/ a little more contour.
2,lumbar roll,Too firm and not comfortable at all. I don't even use any more. went back to using rolled-up towel.
5,Perfect,Absolutely what I was looking for. Truly has made a huge difference in my posture and my neck pain. I don't go anywhere without one of these.
2,Too thick!,"I found the other lumbar pillows to be usable, but not this one. It's too thick and hard. I also bought the slim model which is very good."
1,Roll was squished in under a week!,"This roll was very comfortable at first; however, after using it for less than a week it has deformed into an oval shape and offers no support. I was only using it for a couple of hours a day! My last lumbar roll lasted for years without losing shape. Very disappointed in this product."
3,A little uncomfortable for my liking,Product appears to loose shape after a while and become useless. Im sure the comfort issue is an issue of personal taste with me. Others may like it
1,i hated it,"I got this pillow thinking it would help my lower back while sitting on a reclining chair, but it doesn't at all. As soon as I laid back on the pillow, it collapsed and basically became useless; flat like a pancake. Plus, the pillow was much smaller than expected and the strap didn't even fit around my chair. I returned it and would never buy it again."
2,I don't know what the big deal is?,"I bought 2 due to my back problems and the raving reviews.The quality is alright but it doesn't stay in place and the strap doesn't really hold it in place.It slides down and ends up being in the bottom of the backseat.If I buy again , I'd buy something that fits the arc of the back and no need to spend a lot."
3,Quite soft,"The product .. the right size, but quite soft. Sober design, ideal for office and home. I hope I can get used to it in the chair."
1,complaint,the pillow quickly loses its firmness within weeks.Its quality is much poorere than when I bought one 4 years ago. I'll ask for a refund.
5,Mckenzie,Really good product for people who have to sit in a chair all day at work. But you have to do the stretches too!
2,Waste of money.....,"The concept of a lumbar roll is very useful, and this product fulfills that need, albeit with 2 major obstacles.A, after a few weeks, this becomes as flat as a pancake and is useless....and B, you can create as good, or better support with an old towel, or generic foam piece or any number of improvised materials. These people pray on one's desperation to feel better, instead of giving you simple directions as to use common household items they lead you to believe this will be that much more effective...well, it isn't so don't waste your money. Lumbar support it very useful, but you absolutely do not need this product to obtain it."
3,Good for the back,"I have this McKenzie Lumbar Roll strapped to one of my desk chairs and I am trying it out there. I did try their suggestion of wearing it attached around the waist and then having access to lumbar support wherever I sat. I find it bulky and the elastic is too loose for this idea to work for me.The roll is stiff and unforgiving. But if I am sitting in one position at my desk for a long period, then I appreciate the lower back support it provides. Probably could save money by getting a small, firm pillow for the same job.I greatly prefer the McKenzie Super Lumbar Roll."
2,Might want to try the firmer version,"I'm a fairly average sized guy (height/weight), but the foam in this roll isn't firm enough to keep it from going completely flat when in use. It does return pretty much to its original shape when not in use, however, it doesn't support my back enough to maintain the proper curvature of my lumbar when I'm seated. Perhaps I should have ordered the firmer version that some of its reviews claim was too firm. It's too late and not worth the time and money to return the two I received. Perhaps I should have ordered one of each. With two ruptured discs, this means I may end up buying a third lumbar roll (firm this time) when I only needed one roll."
2,OK big and soft,"for most people the super roll would be better, thinner and firmer but I don't love either strap lumbar good..."
4,Helps with my poor posture,"Keeps it's firmness and shape. Durable outer shell. The strap is sewn on at one end, so if I want to remove it I'll have to cut it off. This is rather inconvenient."
5,Driver's Back will love this!!,"Until I experienced a bulging disk, I took my happy back for granted, and could bounce out of my car with no pain, only occasionally feeling stiff from sitting without real lumbar support. That changed abruptly and it was agony to climb from the driver's seat and straighten up enough to begin walking. Even now that the back has healed, I will never remove this lumbar roll from my car seat."
5,lumbar roll,It makes my back feel better. You need to take the plastic off and squeeze it because it is very firm. My pt person told me to get this particular type.
3,McKensie Lumbar Roll,The roll is firm & maintains its shape well. The strap is a good length to circle the body or fit around a chair for stationary positioning.
2,I dont like it,"I work on computer 8 hours a day. I looked this product online and thought it might help me reduce back pain. I use it everyday on my office chair but, i am not satisfied with the product. Once you put it on your chair, you have to adjust it every time you change position. It slips of the chair and the elastic band doesn't hold it well. Overall it does help a little bit but its more of botheration for me."
2,Get the firm density one!,"After a back surgery, I purchased both standard firmness and firm density to try them out. I've used them on my work chair and a couch at home. Standard firmness one gets flattened after using it for few minutes and no longer gives any support on lower back. Firmness density one stays its shape no matter how long I use it and gives a good support. I hope that both have better straps so they won't move."
5,Perfect for my back.,Perfect support for my lower back.I use this for the chair in my PC room.Portable and perfect density for my lower back.I am glad I purchsed the Standard intead of the extra firm.)
1,worthless,We read the other reviews and were anxious to try it out. It was worthless. It was uncomfortable to use and did not offer any comfort only more pain.
3,Lumbar Roll,"This item was recommended my physical therapist. However, I can not get it to stay in position on my chair. The straps to hold it in place have too much elastic in them and the pillow slips down."
5,Lumbar Roll,I ordered for my Husband. He loves it. He has a very bad back so this really helps when sitting.
4,Great Product!,"I was skeptical about this at first, but after struggling with back pain for over 2 years, I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! This is the only product that has helped! I wouldn't be without it."
2,Weak Support..Useless,Only thing about this product is the cheap price. I have not thought it is a kind of simple sponge. You cannot consider a piece of sponge as a lumber support.
5,No more back ache,I had lost my lumbar roll while on vacation. I couldn't wait to get home so I could replace it.
4,Lumbar roll - great back support,"The Lumbar roll was exactly as described. Item arrived quickly, well-packaged. Item pricing + shipping was reasonable- not the cheapest, not the most expensive, however quality of the item was right on target.I would buy from this source again, without hesitation!"
3,Frothy,"Humourless account of the transition of 'By Jeeves' to the Great White Way. Mr. Jarvis is a little bit of a snob and I just could not get past that, but he did keep a thorough diary of his experiences. Many fussy details about shopping and entertaining himself in the U.S. and all at a remove. He seems a remote individual. It illuminates Lloyd Webber in a gentle, non-too-flattering light and illustrates the frustrations of trying to mount a production in uncertain conditions. Will they make it to Broadway? That is the question behind the title of this book. This read was a quick, light journey into an actor's ruminations."
4,Bang for the Buck,"OK so this is my 3rd Magic Blue. It may be my last because they aren't made any more and the closest thing to it at Sears now is more than twice the price I paid for this. Yes they die after a while, but while they are alive they do a great job! Plenty of suction and lightweight with a long cord. Very pleased with this product!"
1,This vacuum has a design flaw,Between all my family members we have owned three of these vacuums and all three have had a problem with them shorting out. The vacuum will be running and will go in and out of power. The design flaw is in the neck of the hose where it connects to the main body of the vacuum.
4,"Great vacuum, but waaaaay over priced.....","I own this vacuum and it is really great on hard-wood and tiled floors, but DO NOT buy if you have a lot of carpet in your home because, like others have said, it will not work well on carpet. On other floors you shouldn't find any trouble at all. JUST DON'T GO OVER SCREWS, or really big objects, AND THINGS THAT MIGHT ROLL AROUND THE ATTACHMENTS OR THEY WILL SURELY NOT WORK WELL AND MAYBE EVEN BREAK (as with all other vacuums)!Another thing: this vacuum is way overpriced at amazon.com!!!!! I bought this vacuum for $76 at SEARS about a year ago and it is still in great condition and I use it a lot considering that I have to constantly clean up after my kids. Check out the prices at other stores before considering to buy it here. This vacuum may run for probably about $100 now at SEARS..."
5,REAL MAGIC!!,"I have owned two MAGIC BLUE Canister vacuums. They are the best. I live in an apartment with all carpeted rooms and three cats. I am a daily vacuumer. This vacuum picks up everything (I swear it would swallow my plants if it could)!! The brush end of the wand pushes up the carpet and then sucks up hairs, lint, etc., with super-strong suction. I think this is a great vacuum for any home environment(single, family, etc.) I bought both vacuums at Sears in Burbank, CA for a very reasonable price and they each lasted about 5.5 years (I think I would have kept them longer, but the wands broke from daily use and I could not find replacements)."
1,Problematic,"I've owned this vacuum cleaner for a few years now. I have pets, so there's always lots of fur to vacuum up. Although this vacuum is light weight and easy to use, the carpet head constantly clogs with pet hair. I do not recommend this vacuum cleaner if you have lots of pet hair to vacuum up."
4,great for the price,"I received this vacuum and it is perfect for the downstairs of our house which is all wood floors and area rugs. I would recommend it highly for tile and wood flooring, but not for wall to wall carpeting unless you use this as a second vacuum for quick clean ups. It is very light and the suction seems to be great so far (I am pretty fussy about the vacuums we own). The best thing is that it is so small and light that I find myself taking it out to vacuum a lot more than with my old, heavier vacuum. So even if it doesn't have as much suction, I think that my house is cleaner b/c it is not such a pain in the butt to drag out the vacuum cleaner. Just one way of looking at it! Works for me!"
4,Great for homes without much carpet!,"I have had this vacuum for several years and LOVE it! I vacuum almost daily, and the vacuum has fablulous suction and is light and just keeps working. No problems whatsoever. I did throw the carpet attachment out at one point because it is heavy and unnecessary. We have mostly wood or tile floors, and one big living room rug, and the Magic Blue is perfect."
2,Great until the floor heads break...,This vacuum was really great until the floor heads broke. Both have gone in under 3 years.Parts are also a pain to find.
4,This is a MUST READ!!,"If you are a working mother, you MUST READ this author's story. Not only did she just print a story, but she also has provided ALL READERS with some concrete lifelong instructions for survival that we can use.Thank You for putting these feelings in print! Who among the working mothers population can't see themselves in any of the dilemmas that the author faced?"
2,No,"I'm really surprised at all the positive reviews this got. She did give some guidelines which are nice, but I found it very hard to drum up much sympathy for the author, who seemed very full of herself and self-focussed. Her life was, in general, not a struggle; she seemed to get everything she wanted easily and more than most people can dream of getting. She had a few bumps and now she's back on track and that's why she wrote the book. I would not recommend it."
1,too many mistakes,"Full of errors and mistakes -- not only this, but the author is impossible to follow. Had to buy another book on the topic. Stay away."
3,Not the best I've seen,"This book is for people with a reasonable knowledge of HTML 4 who want to learn the basics of Cascading Style Sheets Level 1. Damon Dean wrote ""FrontPage 2000 For Dummies: Quick Reference"" which was a very useful guide indeed, but this book falls short of that, both in terms of layout and content.Finding things is hard - as a reference it is pretty hopeless. The tutorials work but they seem to jump around too much. There is a section on how well CSS works with XML, but the author writes his code in CAPITAL letters, which is a no-no in XML. XML and XHTML are case sensitive and must be written in lowercase.You get a basic grounding in CSS with this book, but I suspect it teaches you some bad habits in the process. For someone who just wishes to add a little bit of style to an otherwise boring website - this will probably suffice."
1,Who edited this book?,"The writing in this book is muddy, and like another reviewer here, I had to buy a second book to figure out what this book was saying. Since Dummies books are for beginners, a logical order running from easy to difficult should be used. This author is all over the place.The above is bad enough, then add to this the obvious fact that the book was merely spell-checked but never looked at by an editor (or at least by one who knows grammar and syntax).The code isn't consistent, and the index has errors.Don't buy this book. It was obviously pushed out the publisher's door without any attempt to make sure customers get their money's worth. Don't you get ripped off too."
2,Not that good,"I find that as a book for people new to the topic, this is very confusing. The author jumps all over the place from basic topics to advanced topics and back again in the same chapter. It's hard to follow, and it's hard to figure out how to make CSS work."
5,A Valuable Resource,"I've put together a few web sites, and I wanted to expand my knowledge of web technologies. I picked up this book because I'd heard of style sheets, but had no idea what they were. This book is concise, well-written and uses good examples to show how you can improve your site with Cascading Style Sheets. It's a Dummies book, so it's not overwhelming, and that's exactly what I needed."
2,Only if you really are a dummy!,"While it's true that the Dummies series are supposed to provide a way for the less-proficient to easily get their feet wet, this installment is so annoyingly scripted as to be headache-inducing. The author attempts to lighten the load by injecting humor into the book. But the jokes are bad and they mostly just clutter the author's run-on sentences. The text is so cutesy at times I found myself actually getting fatigued reading it. This book could be simplified and probably cut down by 50 pages if the author would dispense with the ""funny"" interjections and just focus on the topic.Of course, it's just a beginner's guide, so the book serves no practical reference purpose after you get through it."
4,Little pricey,"I bought this for my den. I had cd;s ,videos video games all over the place. Got everything in one place. Problem solved. The only problem I had was one of the sliding doors was sticking. I wiped the cabinet down with furniture polish,got some in the track that the door slides in and that fixed it fine. I would recommend this product. It looks nice."
2,Crooked doors!,"While the color of the cabinet is right for ur decor, that is the only good thing we can say. Overall, the dimensions are off and the screws are too short, causing many problems -- particularly that the doors hang crooked despite lengthy, laborious adjusting. We are going to buy another unit from a better vendor and give this one to our daughter."
2,beware :|,beware :|if you buy an r100 get the supported toshiba cdrw/dvd drive: while you still can :)) otherwise you wont be able to boot a windows cd if u want to re-install operating system rflmao...ie:r100 has no cd drives hahaha...
5,Great Find!,"Got the Japanese CD for my birthday a few days ago. This has been on my list for years. this is such a great session. The arrangements are different, and they do indeed swing. Highly recommended if you like the 1958 Messengers and the Jazztet"
2,Why ?,"You have got to be kidding me. I understand that there have been different versions of THE GUIDE, but come on...Just from the trailer I was extremely unhappy with the following changes from the best book I've ever read1. Zaphod has ONE HEAD2. Marvin looks like the robot from Rocky 43. When do they save the universe in the first book...oh yeah, they don't4. A ten year old kid... where the heck did he come fromI can keep going but I'll stop.I want this movie to be good so bad that I have to stay positive.At least it was finally made.Don't Panic... Bring a towel"
1,Marvin says it best...,"""I have seen it. It's rubbish"". I was very disapointed with this movie, and people who have read the book also say they expected a lot more from it."
2,BARGIN BIN MOVIE,THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN AWHILE. IT WILL BE DOUBTFUL IF IT MAKES THE BARGIN BIN.
2,The Little Film that Couldn't....,"As a loyal fan of Douglas Adams, I am sorry to say that this movie just doesn't cut it. Sadly!. Its the type of movie that just didn't come together; editing, timing and a couple of key cast members seriously hamper the pithy, clever and bantering style of the books and even the early 80's television series.Its a shame, because the costumes, special effects and script are all good. But something went seriously wrong. It was just plain boring, and timed wrong."
2,Not very funny,"This movie has its moments, but they are few, short and far apart. It's mostly just not funny. It suffers from bad, unconvincing acting (or bad casting) - the actors somehow seem incapable of delivering lines. It's amazing how they got Marvin to *not* be entertaining. Slartibartfast's attempts at threatening Arthur don't feel like he's really trying, just going through the motions. When the plot does stumble upon some funny innovation (like the POV gun), it's overused and becomes annoying. The Trillian-Arthur relationship is irritating, particularly because it leads to cheesy moments involving cheap moralizing and quasi-deep thoughts about insecurity and love being important.The good parts are the dolphin song in the intro, the general look of the film (I particularly liked Marvin's design and the not very spectacular demolition of the earth) and the guide entries. That's nowhere near enough to make a movie though, hence the two stars."
2,They Disney-fied It,"The film version of ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" really doesn't work.The actor who plays Arthur Dent did not seem to have any comic timing, which is odd because I've been told the same actor is hilarious in the original version of ""The Office."" Maybe the director asked him not to be funny in this film.The inserted a Carpe Diem (sieze the day) message into the film - whereas the book had more of a Crappy Diem message (another crappy day).The add a new storyline on the Vogon home planet which is supposed to make fun of bureaucracy - but if the filmmakers think having to fill out TWO different forms is a hardship, then I question their sanity."
1,Snore...,"I didn't think a movie about outerspace and aliens could be this boring. I haven't read the book, but I sure hope it's more entertaining and lively. Thefilm was excruciating to sit through, and so disappointing. I really started to hate it the longer I watched.I expected a fun, lively comedy-sci-fi film. This one totally undelivered. I recommend skipping - you're not missing out."
4,"Quirky, weird, worth a watch",This movie is like something from another galaxy. While being very enjoyable it's also quite chaotic and hard to follow. Because that was the entire point of the novel (and subsequently the movie) you have to enjoy it for what it is. Mos Def's performance definitely made the movie for me.
3,You need to read book and watch original series to appeciate the title,I saw and watched the BBC offered series and read the book which was more extensive. The robot was better in the series. Arthur and Ford were better in the series. Trillian was better in the movie. Worth the watch for never saw either.
2,"Awesome aesthetics, horrible narrative","I remember I had seen this movie some years ago... and thinking how cool were things displayed on it. A few days ago, I was talking to my wife about this movie, so we decided to watch it.I could not believe I didn't remember how slow it was, and how mediocre the story was. This is not me being a snob critic, this is my wife and me, deciding wether to just stop watching it. And Zooey Deschanel is in it?! How did I forget that! Had I remembered she was in there, I would have never had the face to even suggest my wife we should watch it."
2,Boring,"As I liked the book(s) for their wit, often hitting the ground laughing, I found the film quite boring. It laks the interesting dialogue the book supplies and tries to work only with the imagery. For me, that was not enough. The film is nice to see on a rainy day and perhaps for a fan of the books a wannahave. But in the end you'll feel disappointed."
4,Is It Stupid Or Ingenious,I must let people know first that I knew absolutely nothing about this stories past or history so this was the first time I heard of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy but no disrespect I'm just a little young. The film is a bit long but as a newcomer to this story it's very hard for you to get bored of it because it has so much imagination. It's a movie that will definitely make you use your brain but it's something that isn't for everybody. I like that it was not the same old movie you always see and can't stand. Though it is good the first time I think a third or fourth time would be a little heavy on your brain. I thought it was pretty good and the visuals are very nice. It can get stupid at times but it's stays in a good blend of inteligence and comedy. I can't compare it to it's original novel so for the people that are just hearing about it it's worth at least one watch.
4,Fun but...,"a bit less so if you've read Douglas Adams' work before viewing the film. The spirit of the books isn't violated but despite the candy colored film's appeal and enjoyable (deliberate over-) acting, it can't reproduce the books' mind-bogglingly incessant creativity, deliciously cynical wit, and delightful whimsy and humor."
5,great for sci fi,"i am absolutely not a sci fi fan and when this originally came out and had such great reviews i kept wondering to myself what everyone around me was smoking because how could a sci fi movie possibly be any good. then i accidently watched it one day and fell in love. yea, it really is a great sci fi movie. its goofy so if you're not into that sort of thing, avoid it but coming from a non sci fi lover, if all sci fi movies were like this i would definitely own more movies of the genre."
1,About the worst movie I ever saw,"The only reason I stayed with this movie thru most of it was because I was watching it with my granddaughter. Had never heard of the book it was based on, or the authors. But this may well be the worst movie I ever saw. Imbecilic characters, an impossible plot, and I cannot tell how it ended because, when the granddaughter fell asleep, I turned it off and went to bed. Had to give it one star because Amazon won't let you leave it blank."
3,Hard to Follow for Uninitiated,"I've read Hitchhikers about a dozen times, so I knew what was going on all the way through. My wife, on the other hand, had no clue as she had not read the book. It seems you need the book to ""get"" the movie. I give the film makers credit for trying and I can only imagine how hard it would be to make this film stand apart from the novel.The performance of by the actor playing Arther Dent was mediocre. Mos Def was spot on, as was the fellow who played Zaphod. The actress playing Trillian was a bit annoying, but a good physical match.The sound quality of this movie is terrible! Dialogue is too soft and ambient noise is too loud!If you are not a fan of Douglas Adams and the five or six books in the Hitchhiker trilogy then you should probably pass on this movie."
4,Randomness,"When I was a young teen, till my now current 28 year old teen, I have always enjoyed the humor that came from the random. Monty Python, Animaniacs, and this movie all have this often misunderstood and hard to perfect trait of randomness. Random for the sake of entertainment and humor really isn't all that random, but follows a somewhat deranged and curiously built train of thought. For those that either think that way or simply can see the humor in it, this movie is a pleaser. I'm sorry to say I haven't ready the books that this movie is trying to encapsulate, but I can say that my far and away response and review to the film is 42."
4,Fun! But not the same at the book,"I enjoyed this movie, bringing such a great book to life. But as is such with most movies, it really doesn't come close to the book."
3,"Amusing in places, but thin","I never read any of Douglas Adams' books, so I approached this movie with an open mind. My wife and I both found it mildly amusing, but no more than that. The plot, such as it is, is episodic and skimpy. There are some funny bits, and the visuals are nice, but there's not much character development or real substance. There are better sci-fi comedies, and worse."
2,poor translation of classic book,"If you have not read the 80s classic, do so now. All too human space aliens, explore the nature of the universe, with the helpful Guide. The premise is that the Earth was just a supercomputer designed to answer the question, 'What is the meaning of life?', as a few survivors of its destruction learn.This is one of hundreds of films based on a books, that do not make the translation from reader imagination to the screen. The absurd images in the book, are not so much unfilmable, as not funny as seen here. The cynicism and 'clever clever' humor, is not only very British, but pretty dated at this point.The book is an afternoon well spent, and should not take much longer to read, than to see this mediocre film."
4,Mr. Dent....since when are you the pimp?,"I really thought the love connection between Author and Trillian really detracted from the story. It's like Americans have to have a love story in every single movie. I bet Douglas Adams is rolling in his grave. On a more possitive note, I thought they did a marvelous adaptation of Marvin the Paranoid Android. Sulky and depressed as ever. I wish the horrible poetry of the Vogons was actually horrible. I was hoping it would make me hemirage, but alas...my organs remained stable. Overall I thought this was a good movie. Something just wasn't right about it though."
3,"Funny, the best comedy I watched sooooooo far...............","The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was cernitly NOT the best movie ever.It's OKAY.But the funny pars or whats so ever are GOOD.Although, I'm not getting it on DVD.I'll probaly rent it or something (or not <giggle>.)One or two parts were disgusting like when Zaphod's head got cut off.....EW.Marvin and Zaphod and Trillon are my faviorite character.....but I think I'll like Star Wars Episode 3- Revenge of the Sith better.P.S. I'M VERY DEPRESED NOW!!!!!!P.P.S. NOT REALLY.....P.P.P.S. DON'T PANIC WHILE WACTHING MOVIE!P.P.P.P.S.S. HI."
1,What the ?,I had more fun reading the reviews than watching the movie. The movie was horrible. Like other readers said it was very choppy.The movie was made as if the script was taken from randomly ripped out pages from the book. I am angry I lost 4 bucks renting it.
1,"Awful, Absolutely Gastly","This movie is awful, absolutely gastly. Oh, I guess the Vogon poetry was OK, but it went down hill from there. And don't talk to me about acting because there wasn't any. And I found the lack of directing disturbing. Arthur and Ford were the worse, and then it went into a decline. Trillian reminded me of Liza Lupner. Eddy was the best actor and then Slarty. Oh how I hated it, and that awful little whining football shaped robot. Call that depressed, because I don't. I can't wait to skip the sequel."
2,Introducing the World's Most Expensive Cult Movie Ever Made.,"Whew! Originally Disney had this one opening against Episode III. Wouldn't theat have been somethin'. A film version based on books should be faithful to the book, and I grant you this one is. Too faithful that is. Too many inside jokes and references. Suffers from what David Lynch's ""Dune"" suffered from. How could you just make one movie on these books? Take the cue from ""Lord of the Rings"" and do it as a trilogy. Do it right. The fans deserve it, not a run through of the story at warp speed. Take your time, develop the characters, and for goodness sake, get a good cast. This was just plain awful. The only saving grace was the special effects. Even then it really twerent special."
1,Lackluster adaptation of a fantastic novel,"I love the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books. I love the radio series. I love the unabridged audiobooks. So I was very, very excited to hear that there would be a big-budget film adaptation at long last.It was the most disappointing experience of my life.I hardly laughed once during this fiasco. It simply fell flat on every note. I know, I know, I'm too demanding; fans always are. But this wasn't just mediocre. It was dreadful. Painful!If you can spare yourself this uniquely unfunny travesty, I implore you to do so! There's still time. Do something worthwhile with your life! Read the books!"
1,"God awful, NOT for fans of Douglas Adams!","This movie died at every possible opportunity. It starts off with dropping the biggest joke in Adams' career with Ford Prefect tricking the demolition crew into not tearing down Arthur's house. The original demonstrates political bureaucracy and irony, as well as human gullibility, whereas this movie, Ford just bribes the crew with a few beers then leaves with Arthur. The movie is NOTHING like the book, the TV series (Made into a movie, rather cheaply made but WELL done). Everything in this movie past the first three minutes is NOTHING like the original. I can see why they waited for Adams to die before releasing it in the theaters.This movie will make any more-than-casual fan of Adams vomit in disgust. Not even worth a free rental! You've been warned."
1,Monty Python Meets 'Sesame Street' . . .,"If you enjoyed such films as _Mega Force_, _Top Secret_, _Red Sonja_,_Van Helsing_ and/or _Time Changer_, this film's for you.As for myself, whatever curiousity I felt regarding the novel has been irrevocably quashed.Alan, Alan--what possessed you?!?"
1,VERY Disappointing,"Loved the books but the movie was extremely boring. It was all I could do to sit through it. The 1980's BBC TV series was WAAY better even though it did not have the special effects the movie did. All characters in that series really fit the part and did a much better job. The Zaphod in the movie was terrible, as was Marvin, Arthur, and just about everyone else. Don't waste your money."
3,could have been better,It was alright. My nephews 10 + 12 loved it. The books were so good and this movie took so long to get made that I expected much more.
1,"awful, worse than vogon poetry","The only bright moment in this wreak is the casting of Alan Rickman as Marvin. The rest of the casting is just awful, this was an un-needed remake, the BBC series is perfect and needs no changes what so ever. Avoid this like a Pan Galactic gargle Blaster unless you love torture or are unfamiliar with teh BBC TV series.They lost me with Mos def as Ford and Zaphod's head? UNDER HIS CHIN!!?? DAFUQ!!??There are not enough terrible words in the dictionary to accurately describe the horror of this movie. When it does follow the script it hangs like a turd when it goes off book (and god does it go off book) it leaves you wondering how Adams could have ever been behind this slaughter of his workThis doesn't deserve one star in fact it owes us 5 stars"
2,Awful... does no justice for the books,"I literally did not laugh once during this whole film. The casting was pretty bad; I always imagined Ford Prefect to be a more confident and cool type of character, which was not at all portrayed. The cast had very little to no chemistry, and none of the moments meant to be funny were funny at all. I did like Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin, and John Malkovich did a wonderful job as well. It was interesting to see the novels come to life, and some parts did reflect the imagery very well, but to someone who did not read the series, this film would be very confusing and just plain unfunny. I hope sometime in the near future another film based on the series will be made that better represents the quality humor and amazingness of the novels."
4,I know it is not the book but...,"The problem when you try to fit 5 books in one movie, is that you have to cut out so many things. This is the case. Even if I had fun watching it, there were so many things that I missed from the books. But, after all, it was a good movie."
2,"Kill Zaphod, prior to the movie","I enjoyed reading the book but the movie doesn't live up to the book. It was a bit of a chore to get through it. The character of Zaphod Beeblebrox was annoying and the character of Ford Prefect was boring.I don't understand how someone else could find this a funny and entertaining movie. It just goes to show that we all have our own taste.Why did the movie fail where the book succeeded? Why did I enjoy the humor in the book while finding it tiresome in the movie?Also, I don't remember having a negative reaction to Zaphod while reading the book, but in the movie he was an absolute load, a bad joke, an annoyance.The most enjoyable characters in the movie were the villains, the Vogons. They remind me of the races of muppets in Dark Crystal and of one of the races in The Fifth Element.Zaphod's ""I'm an absolute moron, and annoying besides"" character wears very thin very fast."
3,Whats not to Like,If you are a fan of either the books or radio broadcasts you should not miss out on this crazy ride.
5,I Really Like This Movie,"I watch it every time I see it on TV, had to buy it. It is so much better unedited."
2,"Like the Vogons, Hollywood just zapped the show into pieces","Those that truly claimed the new 2005 movie is great is obviously no fan of Douglas Adams. Perhaps you all should watch the previous 1982 tv series or atleast listen to the radio adaptation or better yet, read the books.The whole Hollywood assimilated production's just another feeble attempt at adapting another great book title into motion picture. Rather sad they butchered it. If not for Alan Rickman and Stephen Fry's voices(the greatest thing in the show), I would have given it a 1 star.Well just expressing my displeasure at how a good title ended up being vulgerly slapped. But if u all really wanted to experience a better Douglas Adams works in visual and/or audio form, I do recommend you all get the past productions. I especially like the British Radio adaptations. They are rather good with them British flair.. Get them now before I read you a Vogon's poetry!"
3,Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"The book was just so much better! I've read the books, and this was the only film I have seen. Heard there was a short series on tv (British); anyone know if it was good? The movie was pretty cute, but the books were tons better!"
3,"Funny, But Did Not Live Up to Its Hype","I was frankly disappointed in this movie. I had loved the books (it actually incorporates elements of all four books of Douglas Adams' trilogy) years ago, and I expected to love the movie. Well, I did enjoy it, but love? No.Perhaps it is too British. I keep seeing Monty Python, which I found tedious at times. The monsters are just too ugly to be funny; or too funny to be so ugly. It's as if we are to understand that their loathsome appearance is itself humorous. I don't know; maybe it's a guy thing.On the other hand, the males all seem so foolish (except the black one) and the one female so sensible and courageous that I wonder: is this really all about liberal stereotypes?There are some fun parts, no question. There are even a few really good lines. But frankly, I was seriously disappointed."
4,Great fun,"Before I saw this, I had heard alot of bad things about it. I have read the book many, many times, and was a little worried about watching it. I finally got to see it right before it left the theatre and I have seen it about a billion times after that. I don't know what everybody was expecting. It is insane to think that a movie can be just like the book. The book is so full of subtle humor, there is no way that they could translate that into a movie format. I think that the movie caught the spirit of the book extremely well. It is the fun ridiculous universe that Douglas Adams introduced me to. If you are looking for something fun to watch, especially if you like british humor, you will love this movie. And if you are a lover of the book, don't shut it out just because it didn't live up to ""what you would have done"". Accept it as the classic commedy that it is. It was definately on my list of things to buy for my new blu-ray."
3,Bring a towel,"It's been a long time coming for this film to arrive for all of the Douglas Adams aficionados out there. Seeing as I love the book, I knew that the film would be hard-pressed to live up to my lofty expectations of the incomparable work of fiction. With such imaginitive and bizarre goings-on and creatures in the book, I feel that the movie tried and succeeded for the most part to live up to the book, although in the end it left some creativity to be desired. Sam Rockwell was dead-on as the carefree spirit of Zeephod Beeblebrox; and the superb voice and acting of Marvin the irretrievably depressed robot was undoubtedly one the film's other bright spots.In summation, I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie unless you've read the book prior to viewing. It's worth a look-see...just bring a towel."
1,Do Panic! PLEASE MAKE IT END!!!,"There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this ""movie"" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film is based on Douglas Adams' novel, though the end result is neither funny nor entertaining.The acting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are way ""below average.""The special effects-oh my-the special effects are beyond words...As for the dialogues, school plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better dialogues! It is truly sad...And for all this sadness, it is the writers and director who are mostly to blame.In conclusion, the potential for a good movie was there if only the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct! A shame really..."
1,They sucked the life out of the story with this version of the movie,Gone is Adam's dry wit. So many jokes are only half told that anyone not familar with the Adam's books will not understand the draw. The old TV series is so much better that anyone connected with this work should feel shame.
4,a zany book makes for a zany DVD,"I have been a big fan of Hitchhiker's Guide for many years. There is an excellent radio version of it, and I think this video is more than an adequate rendition of Adams' zany cast of characters and events. Pure escapism!"
2,Pointless and Not Funny,"My introduction to HGTTG was via the BBC TV series, then the books, so I suppose that biases me in a big way. But after watching this, my thought is it was like redoing several classic Monty Python TV skits with different, unfunny actors and a higher budget. In other words - not good. Basically, I think it should just have been left alone - you can't really improve on the TV series. Special effects don't matter - in fact - they make it worse, because special effects aren't funny. Low production values actually add to the humor."
2,Should have been better,"I fell in love with the Hitchhiker's Guide through the radio series, and maybe that's part of my problem with this movie. The voices weren't quite right. I love Alan Rickman and thought he'd be perfect for Marvin, but somehow, it just didn't work. Whiny rather than depressed. And the voice of the Guide didn't quite capture the deadpan goofiness required. The acting is fine, especially Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent, though Sam Rockwell's over-the-top performance did get a bit annoying after a while. But the thing that bothered me the most was that the movie just isn't funny. I'm sorry to say that despite Douglas Adams' involvement in the original script, it just falls flat at almost every turn. I didn't expect the movie to match the radio series - there's really no way a movie could - but even so I was greatly disappointed. I still guffaw at the radio episodes and even the BBC TV series, but I barely cracked a smile through this movie."
3,"Better than expected, and yet ... just missed","The other reviews have spoken to both sides of this movie, and the truth is, it lands somewhere in between. Long-time fans will be disappointed because one of their favorite bits will be missing, (Some of mine were.) BUT ... the overall film is fine. It's entertaining, funny and even manages to expand upon the original in spots. The whole Humma Kavula storyline was a bit slapdash and did nothing to move the film forward. In fact, I thought it pulled attention away from the delightful Vogons, who don't need to be hired by someone else to be badguys. Anyway, there are surprising bits, and many funny bits. If you enjoy a good comedy, this one's worth the price of admission.BTW, anyone got a line on what special features will be on the DVD?"
5,My Hitchiker's Guide Review,"It was hilarious. It kept me smiling. I gave it as a gift to someone who likes comedy and dolphins. My favorite was the singalong with the most intelligent species in the world, but the humans and ""humanoids"" were very funny also. I hope the one I gifted it to shows it next time I go to visit and I can finish watching the clips at the end which also were great. I'm sure the one I gave it to will be happy to know that there is a dolphin sanctuary in the world somewhere where the dolphins can give you a ride if they choose to, but don't have to if they don't want to. I think it deserves the five star rating I gave it."
3,Interesting enough,"Being a monstrous fan of the books, I had to watch this. It was interesting enough but nothing special. If I hadn't read the books I would not see any reason to read them after I saw this. Nothing struck me as funny. I thought that Zooey just simply did not act very well in this.The scene where the philosopher-kids asked Deep Thought for the answer was awful. The BBC series one was very funny.This movie was just like the majority of big movies. Acting was fine, production was fine, etc. but nothing special. Too bad. I really wanted to love this."
4,42.,"Personally, I think Mos Def is a little TOO cool to be playing Ford Prefect. Arthur Dent, cast pretty much perfectly. Zaphod, cast well, but the hidden second head...nah...you need the full-sized, wise-cracking, second personality right there in the mix.I still watch the BBC's mini-series every few months, and still read the novels every year or two... Die hard? Perhaps... Wait, let me cover up the '42' sticker on the front of my computer...."
1,Really not good,I wish I had this 1 hour and a half of my life back. Just wax your whole body instead.
5,4.5 stars! Not as great as the book but a damn fine movie!,"Well, I went to see this yesterday and It was awesome. I read the book and I loved it so I saw it and I found out it wasn't as good but DAMN fine!PLOT: Arthur Dent, an Earthling, and his friend, both hitch a ride one day on a spaceship and are taken through space to explore.THOUGHTS: The s/fx are amazing. everything else is good. I especially thought MARVIN was cool. so go see this movie today!"
2,Dopey and unfunny,"This is a terrible excuse for science-fiction and comedy. I have never read the book but sure wouldn't want to after seeing this film. The humor resembled Monty Python movies in a way but in a ""sillier"" and a more annoying way.Sam Rockwell's character as the captain of the ship they are on really baffled me at how annoying he can be. This is a slapstick not to be viewed by except for HIGHLY devoted fans of the book because the humor just doesn't work.The f/x is this are unbearable. This is a cheap low-rent version of a Star Wars movie. By the way, speaking of Star Wars, this movie should've never been placed 3 weeks away from it b/c sci-fi fans will be so enthusiastic over Sith that this will seem like some cookie-cutter cheaply made waste of time, which is exactly what I thought of it."
1,"If your masochist enough to watch a truly horrible movie, Just One-Click this DVD","If you didn't like this book, you'll hate the movie as absolutely nothing happens.If you liked the book, then you'll hate the movie. The makers of this film spent a lot of money, followed the plot perfectly, and ended making an absolutely humorless adaptation of the book.How bad is it:Think about ""Equus"" but only without the deepness in thought.Think ""Phantom Menace"" only without any battle scenes.Think ""Planet Nine from Outer Space"" only without the cheapness and bad acting that makes it so bad its good.Think ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"" without Death in it.Due yourself a favor and pretend that this movie was never made. Go buy a copy of the actual book or an Audio Book version and you will be forever grateful to the greatness of Douglas Adams."
1,Panic,"After seeing this movie, I think it is very possible that Douglas Adams' death was a suicide. At the very least there should be an investigation."
2,Pure Drivel....,"That is all that I can say to describe this movie....just got done watching it for screening purposes for the video store I work at, and this movie was one of the worst that I had seen in years...the script was not very well put together...acting was something not to be desired....I have to say that some of the alien characters were interesting...effects were so-so. I would not recommend anyone buy this movie...if you must watch, rent instead....and please as someone else has pointed out...sequel????PLEASE NO!!!!"
3,Was I the only one ?,"Am I the only one to think the trailer looked somewhat Pythonesque ? I'll suspsend judgement, proving the movie isn't done like I-Robot that was ""inspired by"" - I wouldn't mind a little new materiel (I know) I've read the books so often & have the show on CD - It's great & I want more."
3,Dr. Who with production values?,"Actually it is more than that. I've not read the books this nonsense came from. It is a bit derivative of Monty Python or Saturday Night Live in that it seems like a series of bits. The Plot? A strange assortment of nuts are thrown together as they roam the universe searching for the meaning of life. Earth has been destroyed by the Vogans, an anal race of bureaucrats who are building a by-pass through the galaxy. Apparently Earth did not have it's paperwork in order. The Vogans were the best thing in the movie but they are frightenly familiar. The movie doesn't hold together very well as a movie but it is fun & funny. Maybe it would have benefited from the vision of the author. Unfortunately he is no longer with us. See it now or later. Maybe the producers can explain it to me on the dvd when it comes out."
1,How was I to know?,"I bought this movie when it first went to DVD because of all of the hype when it was released. I had no idea what the movie was about and I got suckered. Which I admit, has happened before.All I can say is let me warn you before you do the same, if you haven't already. I can count the number of times on one hand that I was unable to sit and watch even a bad movie through to the end. This one didn't even make it half way before I was so disgusted with it I had to stop the torture. No review necessary, just 3 words. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE!,"This movie is awful.There has never been a stupider movie. It is a total time, energy, and money waster, and I can't believe it even made it past the editors of the movie.1)The actors can't act. (although,who could act such a horrible plot-line?2)The movie makes no sense what-so-ever. It is utterly dumb, and skips from idea to idea like none-other.3)It seems to praise Darwin-ism, and then diss it, all in one scene. It also disses the Christian church, along with many other things.4)And to top it off, it made fun of one of the best movies of the century, Star Wars.5)Plus, this movie was not even funny. At all.Don't waste your effort on this movie. It was an awful waste of time."
2,Hitchhiker's Guide to Stupidness.......,"I am an avid DVD ""collector."" Movies that I tend to miss at the theater that appeal to me, I will often run out and purchase as soon as available. With a collection of over 500 now, and watching more movies than my collection contains, I feel that I am qualified to make critical assessments. Last night, I purchased the Hitchhiker's Guide, in of course widescreen, and two friends and I watched it over some pizza and Rolling Rock. Folks, I felt so compelled to write a review, that I did it the following morning. THIS MOVIE IS STUPID. It has a plot, one with great possibilities, and although it did contain a subtle few quips that were mildly intertaining, it was a complete letdown. If it were not for the beer, the pizza, and the company, I would have felt totally dissapointed. BTW, in the event that you may see me as overly critical, my two friends felt my pain as well, except for the sting in my wallet. THUMBS DOWN, all the way. Cheerio."
3,Adapting British Books/films,"When are people going to learn that adapting British comedies very rarely works? Britain has it's own brand of comedy that should stay British. If you want to adapt something, you have to acnoledge that it will lose this unique comedic quality of its original country. The same could be said of most Japan/America adaptations. Why not just write an entirely new story for the American audience? Of course then you wouldn't get any of the fans from the original work. Feel free to rip this review apart, just try to make the critisms somewhat specific. P.S. It's a little strange that we're forced to assign a rating score to something that hasn't even been released yet."
4,Hilarious comedy!!!,"A little on the dimwitted side but very funny and always great for a laugh!!!! A raucous, weird, understated comedy!!!!"
2,Leaves a lot to be desired,"Two stars goes with ""I don't like it"", but I wouldn't say that. I didn't expect much, but it wasn't that great. It's been a long time since I read the book, and I think the story might have been trying to cover too much information in a short period of time."
3,Very bizzare,I don't know what I was thinking when I thought I wanted to see (and own) this movie. I think this is more of an insiders movie and I'm not sure it I'm on the inside. The attempted humor made me feel like I was listening to a series of inside jokes that I knew nothing about. It was pleasant enough that I could watch it again and maybe it would grow on me the way Napoleon Dynamite did. My guess is this is probably a very quotable movie I just don't know if I could convince any of my friends to watch it and quote with me. The PG rating is accurate and appreciated. It's not a bad movie. But a little to far out for me.
3,Loved the Guide; Missed the Restaurant,"I saw this one in the theatre. I read the books years ago, but never connected with the TV or radio series. The film was fun, well-cast and relatively faithful to Adams' spirit. I particularly enjoyed the Vogons and the Guide itself. I was disappointed by the miserable robot and by the failure to depict the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which I remember as one of the highlights of the books."
3,Entertaining but a disappointment for Adams fans,"If you missed the NPR broadcasts of the BBC import, this movie is a nice intro to the series that has become a true cult classic. It gives you a taste of the quirky and insightful thoughts of Douglas Adams as well as his wicked sense of humor and irony. Trying to make a satisfactory film version of this show was going to be hard because of Adams' vision as well as the die-hard fans who are used to hearing the voices of Stephen Moore, Simon Jones and Mark Wing-Davey. Nevertheless, a few of the performers - Sam Rockwell (Zaphod B) and Bill Nighy (Slartybartfast) in particular - establish the possibility that die-hards such as myself need to let go of the past.It has its cute moments, hopefully enough for people to be curious about the original radio show and check it out. That said, the movie is more Hollywood than Adams."
3,Not for me,"It was what I expected.There's okay comedy , not the best and not alot of it.But it's a very different movie , which I always love.This movie is by far the most different sci-fi comedy movie than others.I cannot say to buy it because it's not worth 20 dollars let alone 15 dollars.It's worth renting if your gonna sit down with your kids and watch it.I don't recommend renting it and watch it yourself.Give it to your kids , they should like it."
3,More clever than funny.,"This movie is more clever than funny. At the funny points in the movie you smile instead of laughe and say thats funny. It's a cute movie, I thinks it worth a check out."
5,THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY (2005),This movie was so sweet. It was like a existential british Star Wars! There was alot of british humor in the film that apparently a lot of people did not understand but I did and I was laughing out loud! This was a very neat movie and I recomend it.
1,"It's CRAP - Get the 1981 BBC TV version instead. This movie is a waste of money, time and space.","I had high hopes for this multi-million budget film version of the HHGTTG. I had prevously read the book and seen the 1981 TV series, which was superb! The casting on this movie was horrible, the delivery of the lines, as if they were asleep, and the voice of the robot simply boring and without any reason to laugh. Do yourself a favor: go to some popular video clip website, watch the TV series, and then buy that DVD (also available on Amazon), but skip this piece of dung movie. It totally sucks."
4,Hilariously Funny!,"Don't be fooled by what other's say. This movie rocked hard. Although I wasn't a Hitchhiker fan until I saw the movie, I've read all the books up till 'So long and Thanks for all the fish'. i've got to say that this movie is a little different from the book. But it's still funny to watch. I'm going to see it again!"
1,"Pointless,makes no sence and just stupid",Ok maybe you have to read the books to get what this movie is about. I did not get what the movie was about. the story is spointless and dose not make sense. The acting was bad and event the visuals were not good. There is lots of stuff that did not fall into place. Overall was really bad.
2,DO Panic!!,"Please tell me that the little shiny thing in the picture is not Marvin. I understand some unimaginative greedy sods in Hollywood need to change some things because they think they know what fans really want, but a shiny-midget Marvin? a one-headed Zaphod?They took the Lord Of The Rings trilogy and came up with a descent movie series (still bummed about Tom Bombadil) but at least they brought the book to life. From the trailers and the stills of the Guide, I am wondering what book they are getting their ideas from.Yes, we have to give it a chance...but there are just some things that do not get changed."
1,What the hell is this??,"I'm at a total loss for words. This movie defies critique. I watched this whole inane thing from start to finish and had no idea what the hell was going on. I kept wondering if there was something wrong with my TV because I could barely understand or hear what anyone was saying.The Easrth is destroyed by some alien race who look like rejects from Jabba the Hut's palace. Two survivors catch a ride on their giant ship and are then blasted into space, where they are picked up yet again. This ship is commanded by some Jesus looking dude who is crazier than a rat in a porta potty.It's a shame millions of dollars on special effects was wasted on this film. The money should have went to feed the poor. I never care to see this movie again, but would be interested if someone (not on drugs) could explain it to me. A British Sci-Fi movie without a plot is just a waste of time for me. Sorry."
5,Cult Classic,This was my 4th viewing of this oddball cult classic. I wish I could buy an electronic copy to download so I could view it on a whim.
1,Very lame movie,I could not even get to the end of the movie. Shouts of joy went up in the room when we turned it off.
3,Family Entertainment,Quirky comedy about the demolition of earth. It was entertaining but I probably would not watch it twice. More of a family friendly movie.
3,Stick with the books or the TV mini-series,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has some smiles but it becomes an uneven love story between Arthur and Trillian instead of that mass of dry humor that we all know and love.The expansion of the Vogons, Marvin and the gun were good additions as was Zaphod's autograph bit. Removing the real reason for the Earth's destruction and the subplot involved was a bad move as was the rescue of Trillian.The election subplot and the subtle dig at religion was mildly amusing, but only mildly.Simply there is too much in the book to translate into such a short film. My kids who have never read them will now do so but I wasn't impressed. I'd stick with the books and the BBC mini-series."
4,Good,"Not excellent, but good. I have watched this previously and enjoyed it. It's a personal taste kind of movie - not for everyone."
5,Enjoyed the movie,"Have always been a big fan of Douglas Adams, and even though it didn't follow the book exactly, it did a good job of following the theme."
4,So Long and Thanks for All the Fish,"There are so many words appropo for this movie. Zany, whacky, psychadelic, campy, quirky ... I think the word I like best for this movie is silly-funny (because I really couldn't pick just one word). It's definitely not your action-packed-shoot-em-up Sci Fi epic. It's charming in a ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" kinda way. I still have the song in my head.It's too bad Douglas Adams isn't still around to continue his Trilogy (of 5 books). He'll be missed for sure, but I hope his legacy lives on. This movie ends perfectly as a setup for ""The Restaurant at the End of the Universe""."
3,New Hitchhiker Movie: Mostly Harmless,"Like so many fans of the Hitchhiker books I anxiously awaited this movie but I was also a bit worried. How would BIG HOLLYWOOD adapt the dry humor of Douglas Adams for a mainstream audience? The answer is: Not very well. I myself found the movie to be hysterical at times but only because I knew the full context of most of the humor as it was presented in the book. The bottom line here is that the humor found in Hitchhiker's guide is made to be read and comes across as confusing in a fast-paced 2 hour film. The book is simply too dense. On a positive note, Marvin's character was probably the best executed and many of the scenes are exactly how I imagined them. I also am a huge Mos Def fan and thought he made a great Ford Prefect. If you are at all interested, definitely read the book before seeing the movie."
2,frantic and univolving,"Granted, this movie had some funny moments and some decent effects, but, who cares? There's some moron who looks like the lead-singer of Nickleback in charge of the galaxy (yet he seems to have no power and is running away with his earthling girlfriend for reasons that aren't clear) who unknowingly authorizes the destruction of earth. One social throw-back who saved an unwitting alien from being hit by a car is saved and together they mostly wonder aimlessly from one set-up gag to the next with an ending so obvious, so fruitless, so poorly executed you're left with nothing but one hilarious song that plays over the credits.Yes the one bright point in this movie is the doulphin song! It's great, but not worth the price of admission."
1,Ugh!,"Take a brilliant BBC TV series, remove the wit, humor, and social commentary and what do you have left? This movie. This is what you get when the marketing folks make a movie. Bland pablum. Get the original it is several orders of magnitude better!"
3,"Great book, Pretty good movie, Okay disc","The transfer is average, I like the movie, but there is virtually nothing on here but the movie. When you put it in, there are no menus, it goes straight into the movie.I'm hoping for an upgraded quality copy of this to see the light of day. Douglas Adams deserves it."
2,"Entertaining, once....","Some funny parts, some ok ideas and special effects. It's a renter, not a buyer."
3,What could have been...,"I read that Adams had picked Hugh Laurie and Jim Carrey to play the leads in this, but it was changed after Adams died. I bet that would have been something great."
4,I enjoyed the movie,"I really enjoyed the movie when I saw it in theaters, and I just bought it on DVD. While not entirely faithful to the book, I still found it very amusing and watchable."
2,For HHG fans only,"This movie is ok. There are a lot of inside jokes that the readers will surely enjoy. However, if you do not like the type of humor found in the books, you most likely will not enjoy the movie.I saw this movie with someone who likes Sci-Fi movies, but doesn't care for this particular genre of books. The only thing he liked about the movie was the opening theme-song ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish.""I am a HUGE HHG fan--played game, read ALL the books--however, I will not watch this movie again.This is one of those movies you have to see ONCE if you are already a fan, but probably will not want to see ever again."
2,Not impressed.,"I hate to agree with the reviewer ""John Q. Public"", but I am forced to here. I wanted very much to like this movie. I remember the books fondly from my teen years, and I have always been a fan of British humor such as Python and Blackadder. That being said, this movie just did not work. I was left feeling flat about the acting, the plot decisions, the special effects, and it just wasn't that funny.The character of Ford seemed incredibly wasted here, and Zaphod was over-the-top in a way that distracted from the story. Trillian was pushed to the foreground in a way that felt forced. Arthur was the character I tried hardest to connect with, and yet just couldn't. He seemed to take all of this a little too in stride, and that pulled me out of the movie."
4,Galaxy Adventure,"Excellent sci-fi, with unusual theme and story. Well done and presented, with several twists that do add to the story (rather than side-track), and it draws you in to root for the good gal and guy. Oh well!!!"
3,Fun for Adams' fans,"One of the main concerns of the critics was that people who have not read any of the Hitchhiker's novels, they won't want to after this. The movie was funny to me, but it was only because I have read the novels and I get the inside Adams jokes. For anyone else, they will watch this movie and really not get it. It loses two stars on my review because of this. When you make a movie, you must must must make it for everyone, not just people who will get it. That's lazy. But, since I am a Hitchhiker fan, I have to say that I liked it, other than the fact that no one but an Adams fan will get it. I chuckled enough throughout to give it 3 stars, but I must say that I was a little disappointed. The actors are funny, especially Freeman and Rickman (as Marvin), but this film is average and eventually forgettable."
1,Worse than Vogon Poetry,"Go ahead and panic because this version is every bit as bad as you've heard. This movie is like the book on acid. Ridiculous casting, and utterly superfluous new sub-plots. Zaphod's second head makes him look like a combination of Spicoli and Charles Manson. Stick with the older BBC version. It doesn't have fancy effects, but it's actually like the books, which means it's funny and enjoyable. This one? As Marvin said, ""I've seen it; it's rubbish."""
4,Quirky Fun,"I have never read HHGTG, how is this possible coming from a sci-fi fan?, haven't gotten around to it. That said this movie is quirky goodness for fans of sci-fi. The cast is great, the Jim Hensen Company's Creature Shop does a fabulous job with the aliens (thank you for limited CGI!), who doesn't love Alan Rickman and Bill Nighy?Martin Freeman is wholy believeable as the everyman trying to make his way with a clueless President of the Universe (terrific Sam Rockwell), depressed robot (hello Alan Rickman), fellow Earth survior (Zooey Deschanel) and laidback cool alien bud (Mos Def) looking for the question to the ultimate answer to life, the universe and everything.Do yourself a favor, don't be put off by the scathing reviews of book fans. The film makers clearly had fun and the audience is invited along, just remember your towel."
4,nice funny movie,"the movie follows the book up to one point, then changes the script completely. If you dont mind aout that, then you canb enjoy an original and fun comedy"
4,neither here nor there...,The issue is how to 'adapt' Hitchhiker - a book that sprung from a multi hour TV series into a movie length version. Hard to do. The movie in the end tries to have it both ways - you really need to have read the book to understand the movie fully or in some cases at all but if you've read the book you realize just how much (and there was a lot) was cut.But I'm not sure that the producers could have done much different. So the '4' rating? The book was great - the movie was just good. I had to explain certain things to others who hadn't read the book but they did laugh at somethings almost reflectively.The best comparison I can come up with is reading the Readers Digest condensed version of a good novel - you get the main points but you miss the odd little things that make the story great.
1,...And People Like This????,This is honestly one of the worst films I have seen in my life. The underlying message of the writer is the most worst part. That Hitchiker's Guide could ever become popular is an indictment against current day culture.
2,Absolutely nowhere even remotely close to a substitute for the book,"Despite the fact the the screen play was originally written by Douglas Adams himself, this is a terrible movie, while the book is amoungst the best I have read, simply because it is so funny."
3,"The Short, Sweet Verdict","Is it great? No. Is it bad? No again. Is Sam Rockwell a freaking comedic genius? Highly probable. The CGI is pretty good, the creature-effects are a taste of 80's nostalgia, and fans of the book should be glad that the author wrote the screenplay.Over all it IS entertaining, but it probably won't add up as a ""lasting winner""."
3,GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS MOVIE!!!!!!!,"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has amazing special effects and it has a good story to it!!!!!! When Arthur finds out that his best friend is a alien from another planet he ends up on a mission through space to rebuild his home planet earth!!!!!! This movie is good,but needed to be more funny you only get a few laughs here and there,but it does have amazing special effects and for a night at home its a perfect movie to relax for at home!!!!"
5,Worth if for any fan,"Well the fans of the book will like it, well atleast most of them anyway. Ofcourse it doesn't really have a plot in the traditional sense but neither do his books really, they just hold your attention and make you laugh and love them. As for the casting I loved Sam Rockwell as Zaphod, its was a thrill to watch. And Martin Freeman from the office was great as well, they couldn't have chosen a better Arthur! I liked everyone they casted except for Mos Def, I think a british actor would have been better. Ford did live on Earth for 15 years, you'd think he'd pick up a bit of the accent, eh? As for the movie, its great and a must have for any fan. But as a movie it isn't that great (unless you've read the book ofcourse)."
5,Great Book=Great Movie,"This is a hilarious movie, but I strongly suggest that you read the book before seeing it."
3,This only works in fairy tales and Meg Ryan movies.,"I liked this book a lot until the last page. It's hilarious and occasionally poignant and a fun, light read.But it was the last page that killed it for me. I was disappointed, reading it and realizing it *was* the last page, and that the closest I was going to get to a happy ending was that the female lead and the male lead exchanged a few words. Their eventual romance was built up throughout the entire book, only to come to a screeching halt just when it might have been going somewhere. Meeting twice and saying two words to each other does not a love story make, no matter how much I like the characters. I would have liked to see them interact more with one another. When I go looking for a love story, I want to see the characters actually fall in love."
3,Not the best chick lit.,"I can't say I hated nor loved the book, I'm about neutral with it. However, I didn't keep it so that means I wasn't dying to keep it in my collection or share it with friends lol.The beginning was slow. Very slow.The middle it got good, even great at some times! I was turning pages..pages...pages....Then it's like the author hit a wall again and I was bored still. Though I always try my hardest to make it through a book even if it's terrible.The ending also seemed rather abrupt and kind of put me off too. I'd only recommend reading this if you have no other options and/or you can get it incredibly cheap or free LOL"
4,Good escapist fun!,"I picked up this book as a light Summer read. I was utterly hooked! It was so outlandish, the story line that is, that I just fell - period. It was a great escape, and I would tell any woman who loves the Bridget Jones-type stories to grab a copy and go. Do you want to lose yourself in some good old fashioned silliness for a while? If the answer is YES, then this book is for you. It's a page turner my fellow chicklits. Enjoy!"
3,Bit of a disappointment,"I'm a huge fan of chick lit, however this book seemed to fall short of others that I have enjoyed so much. I thought that initially the book was very good and then it seemed as if it dragged through the middle to again pick up in the end. I was also disappointed with the ending."
4,Great escapist tale!,"This truly is an ""escapist"" tale - I use that word and so did another reviewer on the book flap. I just think that is the perfect way to describe this book. I read and enjoyed For Better, For Worse by Carole Matthews and this book I enjoyed as well. It was such a quick & easy read. Short & enjoyable chapters...great touches of humor as well as drama. Sometimes it tended to be a bit unrealistic & over the top ... but Carole Matthews has a way of endearing herself to you that it doesn't even matter. Enjoy!"
1,"Long, tedious and not funny","I am generally a big fan of chick lit, especially by British authors. This book was a HUGE disappointment to me. Although the initial concept intrigued me, that's all this book had going for it - a clever initial idea. After that, it all fell apart for me. This book could have benefitted by some major editing by cutting out at least 100 pages, if not more. It dragged on and on endlessly, as the reader waits for the main character and her dream man to finally meet but they frustratingly keep missing each other over and over again. I skimmed to the end and felt cheated by the ending. I know the other reviewers seemed to love it but I definitely feel I wasted my money on this one and I would not recommend it at all."
1,Boring. Boring. Boring.,"I love light, fluffy ""chick lit"" as it's been described. I'm a big fan of the British girl genre, too, Bridget Jones, Shopaholic, etc. This book is horrible, horrible, horrible. The author doesn't even seem to be British, I'd bet she couldn't tell you the difference between a fry, chip or crisp. The inconsistencies really just got to me and I couldn't even get half way through it."
5,I didn't think they could top Sunshine Barato. They did it!,"Yup, they did it. They topped ""Barato"" big time, by creating something different from it. The sound is more mature and intimate, the instruments more varied and interesting. I'm so sorry I held off getting ""III"" under such false pretenses!Note to the band's keyboardist: The Mellotron and acoustic piano flatter the band in a big big way!"
5,simply biting,"i got their first (i think) and pop it in often...then skipped to this....this is a great ""mood"" cd....excellent sound, performances, and bite!"
3,Criticism-It's what you'll wish you could be dreaming about at 3am,"The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism offers students a comprehensive introduction to theory and criticism. The student will also be pleased with the biography section before each critic's essay. However, I did find that it did not provide adequate supplemental material that could further assist comprehension."
3,Product description deceiving,"This product shipped very quickly (arrived much earlier than estimated), saving me from worrying whether or not it would arrive in time for my class to begin.The negative comment I have to say is that, yes, I understand I purchased a used book; however, the product description didn't mention that it is without the cover jacket and had highlights and notes written w/in the text."
3,Flimsy,"What can I say about Norton anthologies? The paper is like tissue, the binding doesn't hold up, and selection of material is biased. Of course, this was required for a college class so it isn't of much consequence whether or not I like the book."
5,comprehensive,"The norton anthology picks up the modern interest in critical theory with an edition that is rigorously comprehensive, cross disciplinary and contemporary. The problem with 'theory studies' is that lately theory has evolved quicker than critics can categorize forms. (Rather like pop music: hard house, house, hip hop, trip hop, downtempo...more genres than performers) The editors have made a valiant effort to find and catagorize everyone. Invaluable. Ranks with the John Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory."
5,Perfect for your Honda/Acura rims!!,"So I bought some rims off craigslist for real cheap with a lot of tread still left. However, they were full of curb rashes. So rather than just driving with them, I take on the daunting task of fixing them. Just google fix curb rash and you'll receive plenty of instructions. This spray paint makes all the difference. It flawlessly matches the paint on the rims so even if you paint more than it's needed, you can hardly tell. I've fixed two sets of rims with this. 2005 Acura TL 17inch rims and 2010 Honda Accord Coupe 18 inch rims. I highly recommend a dremel if you don't already own one..."
5,A Classic!,"This classic collection will bring the 40 something crowd back to their childhood! It is fun to view something that was so cool then and is so fruity now! My kids, however, were not nearly as entertained as I was. I made them watch it to get them back for all the years of Barney and Teletubbies to which I was subjected! If you watched this show as a kid, H.R. Puffnstuff is still your friend when things get rough! ;-)"
1,Boring read,"I got this from the public library. I didn't want to buy the book, as I was a bit suspicious about the glorious reviews that this book has received by the 3-5 other reviewers, who all seem to say the same things in 1 sentence about the book. (If you click on them you'll see they've only written 1 review each, and its about this book-probably the author writing the reviews themselves). Its really a boring, hideously put together book. I unfortunately started to skip paragraphs just to finish the book."
4,amusing beast,"Mysterious and most enjoyable. Witty, lively and entertaining. It retains one's attention and interest right to the very end.Brings to the reader's attention very profound characteristics of the British Empire."
4,good stuff,I was skeptical but am happy with the purchase.it is not the most rugged item but does the job.
3,Good Book!,"This book covers that part of admiral Burke's carreer when he served in destroyers in a fairly interesting fashion. The author spends a lot of time developing the characters of Burke's destroyer captains, and the descriptions of the actions are somewhat overblown. Otherwise, an ok read."
1,I am disappointed that the book turned out to be fiction.,The Author does comment in the his preface what Bull Halsey does not note his forward that the book is fictionalized non-fiction. I am probably not being fair to the author but I just don't enjoy reading accounts where you continuosly wonder whether or not the events are real. I did not finish the first chapter.
1,nothing I didn't already know..,"I didn't look closely at what I was buying, so I bought a book telling what I already knew about Sigmund Freud. I was a Psych major in college so I already knew what this book had to say. It would be a wonderful book for first timers looking to understand Freud but for those already educated in the field, pass on this one & buy a more comprehensive book. This rating has no reflection on the sellers in any way, just the book."
1,Not a good study guide,"This book is full of practice questions. But, the book does nothing to prepare you to answer them. The barrons book has about 20 pages of information about each topic (supervision, patrol, community policing etc) and then asks questions based on what you read. This book skips the information and jumps right to the questions. Not recommended for learning.The barrons book helps is much better at helping you learn and retain information."
3,sgt exam,I did locate the item yesterday after over a month. according to amazon and the post office the item was shipped in early November. As of yet i have not reviewed the item.
4,Good Questions,"This book has a lot of good questions, but the Barron's 4th Edition has much better reading and explenations."
3,Neutral,"Joel Kasow gave this disc a neutral review in Fanfare 24(2):340, finding small faults in style, soloists, and notes. For more complete selections of male choruses he suggests a 4-CD soloist collection by Sawallisch on EMI or a 7-CD medium-sized-group collection by Ortner on Teldec. For a single dic sample I love Knothe's 1987 rendition for small groups (including 4 songs with or by women's chorus) on Capriccio 10 152: this is one of my all-time favorite CDs, for its very Germanic early Romantic singing of a varied and dynamic Schubert program. Absolutely luscious. However, I can't seem to find it on Amazon...."
4,A DISPLAY OF HER VERSATILITY,"This is not one of Donna Summer's more memorable albums like the late 70s classics, but still a good listening experience that displays her versatility. There's bit of everything: some soul, some pop, some disco, some rock and even a bit of jazz. My faves are Love Is In Control, Protection, Livin' In America, and of course, the soaring, spiritual State Of Independence, which is why I'm awarding this album 4 stars. Essential for fans, this album is not however the ideal entry point for those wanting to investigate her music. For those I would recommend one of the Greatest Hits collections or her magnum opus, Bad Girls."
3,Titled differently when it first came out,"When this album was first released, copies of it were titled The Woman In Me. I remember that distinctly. A month later, this title was removed from the cover and it was simply known as DONNA SUMMER. Not sure why they did that, perhaps she changed her mind and didn't want the album to look like a feminist opinion. This album was a hit and miss for Donna, it had a couple of good tracks (including the Woman in Me), but sadly reeks of the early 80s now. Donna herself hated this album, and who could blame her after the problems releasing the album she really wanted to (I'M A RAINBOW).I owned this CD many years ago, and foolishly traded it at a second hand CD shop. Little did I know it would become a collector's item."
1,Buyer Beware! Not Donna Summer!,This is NOT a Donna Summer recording! Donna Summer is Not on this record!People are trying to cash in on her success. She has stated for years that these are not her recordings.Please keep your money.
5,Easily her best!,"I cannot believe those who don't think this isn't her best effort. ""State of Independence"" is easily her ""best ever"" track. And ""Finger on the Trigger"" is arguably the best ever dance track. When Quincy Jones challenged her to equal Chaka Kahn, he got the very best out of her. This is a VERY fine disk. peace."
4,ear candy for hot summer nights,"Although this release contains only 9 cuts it is a must have for summer fans. from ""love is in control"" to springsteens' awesome ""protection"" to ""the woman in me"" summer warmly grooves through jones' stylish production. listen to ""love is in control"" and flashback to hot summers past and future."
4,"""DEDICATED TO THE LOVING MEMORY OF EVA CASSIDY""...","TIMELESS is exactly that, but second to THE OTHER SIDE."
3,Barely Worth Watching,"Brian Dennehy is an excellent actor and that's why I bought this DVD. The acting is OK. The plot is OK. But ... if you took the day off to watch a good movie and relax, don't watch this one. It's only an OK movie."
5,A classic!,"The book was an excellent read when I read it first many decades ago. When a film is made based on a book, it becomes difficult to capture the overall feel and characters of the book due to the lack of narrative capabilities. However, this film is one delightful exception. The characters, plot, speed, theme, and settings have been kept very close to the book. Gripping tale that is narrated beautifully, acted very well, and overall flow of the movie is great. If you haven't read the book, I highly recommend at least watching the movie."
4,good lense protection,I found this helpful in keeping the actual lenses clean and protected when I had to take my camera into the field for a series of photo shoots. I can't vouch for the UV filter but protection of the lense was the reason for my purchase.
4,It does what I want it to...,"I got this filter free with my Canon camera bag, and the filter does what I want it to. I haven't noticed any great reduction of UV haze or whatnot, but the real reason you want one of these is to protect your lens on your camera. It screws right into your lens, and the camera lens cover still snaps into the lens filter, so you actually double your protection.The first time I got some rain drops, dust, dirt, sand on my lens filter, I was really happy that I had one. I can easily just clean the filter haphazardly using my t-shirt, or whatever I have handy, and not worry about it. If I had to actually clean the lens, I would have to be a lot more careful. But if I scratch/haze/ruin the filter, I can just throw it away, and get a new one, for less than $20, whereas a new lens would be hundreds more.The quality of the filter is perfect, it does not make my pictures fuzzy or any less clear, inside or outside.A smart and cheap investment for your camera lens."
2,you get what you pay for,"This filter is cheap and works well in well lit outdoor settings. However, when you move indoors without flash, strong light sources (such as a candle or window) cause internal reflections in the photo."
1,Not Recommended,"I do not recommend this filter. I used it on my efs 18-55 kit lens for protection. However, I found that it increases flare and lowered the sharpness of my images. My kit lens is now filter-less and taking nicer photos.I use a Hoya Super HMC 58mm UV filter on my EF 70-300IS lens and have experienced none of these issues. It only cost about $25."
2,open item,"I received this filter and it had been used, seals were open and case that holds filters cracked, piece of plastic floating loose inside, smug marks on it. I was shocked, I order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this."
4,"Canon glass is great, what else can you say?","I would have given this 5 stars but the first one sent to me was cracked. Amazon.com promptly sent me out a replacement and even paid the postage for the return. Thats why I am a customer, thanks Amazon!"
2,Poor quality workmanship,For the price I guess it's ok but not 2 days after I put it on my camera the glass came loose and started vibrating in the frame. It's very light and thin and will probably break easily.
4,not bad,"it is nice but have to be careful not to scratch the glass. it helps to protect the camera lens from scratch, finger print, and dust."
1,It did not fit the camera,This is made to fit the lens that go with my camera and not my actual camera lens.
5,Good Glass,"Why put a $10 piece of glass in front of your $500 lens? When ever I put anything between the lens and the subject I always make sure that it is of the same quality of the lens or better. Canon lens, Canon filter."
2,CAN'T USE WITH CANON S5 IS!,"This product is tagged to be used with the Canon S5 IS...so I purchased it with the thought of saving my lens from wear and tear.Upon receiving the filter (and the lens cap that I needed to buy to use with the filter), I found that itA. Doesn't attach to the Canon S5 IS unless you have the optional adaptorB. Needs a new lens cap since the camera's won't fit the filterC. If you do use the optional adaptor and attach this filter, you get terrible pictures due to the odd light reflections.I do not recommend this item if you intend to use it with the Canon S5 IS"
2,Can't close housing cover,"It's impossible to close the housing cover after install it even though Amazon, Autozone, Oreilly auto all indicate that this model fits 99 Honda civic LX. Too bad that I have to return it."
3,"Pretty good, not perfect","It fit pretty well into my 1994 4-cyl non-VTEC Honda Civic but it was a little larger than stock so I had to really lay into the air filter box to get it to close even after trying several times to see if it could be shifted or repositioned or if possibly it was hung up on a spot, but it wasn't. Seems fine since then though."
4,I'ts Okay,"Amazon has a feature where you could type in your vehicle's information to see whether this filter fit your car. At first it says this filter fit my car, but then later I try again and it says this filter don't fit my car. This is the K&N 33-2120 air filter. So I went to K&N's website and found out this filter does fit my car! I bought it on Amazon because it's cheaper than buying it directly from K&N. My car was a 1999 Honda Civic DX."
1,Just too tight to be convenient,"When it arrives you will think your ordered the wrong size. Then you will see the size is right, but it fits sooo tight that it is a struggle to take on and off. I would use it daily if it would slip on easier, but holding the Mac on its end with one hand, then with both hand stretching this thing as far as it will go to fit over. So it's great for people with 3 hands. The rest of should keep shopping."
2,You get what you pay for,"Functional, lighter-weight climber; assembly was hindered by poorly illustrated instructions and poor quality control (holes not lining up, difficulty passing cables thru tubes because of excess burrs inside tubes). Construction is adequate but far from confidence inspiring. I really wish I had spent an extra fifty bucks and gotten a better stand."
2,I'd have given it an 8 or 9 three or four years ago,"I'm an industrial strength Quarker, and snapped up this book when it first came out. Although the Xtensions might still be available, they've mostly been upgraded, and therefore changed, and so many more are available, that it really needs to be revised.With Quark 4.0 due out soon, it might be wortwhile to wait to see what works with and without the new package. I hope this once valuable resource will be updated."
5,My one-year old studies the illustrations!,"This little book is a winner. My one year old son, after one reading, loves to study the pictures. The chunky shaped pages are durable and perfect for countless page-turning. The rhyming is outstanding,..it is fluently well-written."
4,Good investment.,"This my second set of B&S calipers (first was stolen) and I love them. They are very acurate and I like the .0005"" graduations on the face, but... Where the heck is the wood box?! I know they got bought by TESA but really, a cheap plastic box?"
5,The cream of the crop!!!!!,"Very smooth action, repeatable readings, well built, best reputation on the market make this the best choice for a caliper. This is probably more than you need if you are reloading bullets but it can be your only caliper you will need for a lifetime. My only complaint if anything is I wish the face was dull WHITE instead of a LIGHT GRAY. I guess with my aging eyes lighter colors are more appealing to me but thats only me. I use this primarily indoors so light reflection is not an issue which the gray face may be an advantage. The storage case it comes in is made of very sturdy plastic and outstanding in my opinion. Outstanding caliper and still Swiss made."
5,One of the Greatest Recordings of the Cello Suites.,"I saw this mentioned in ""1001 Great Recordings to Hear Before You Die,"" and since Steven Isserlis wrote the preface to the book, and since Isserlis' recent recording of the these suites won the 2007 Grammophone Instrumental Record of the Year, I figured it was worth the buy. It is fantastic, even better than Isserlis. It has the forcefullness of Casals and Pergamenshikoiv with the poetry of Starker and the sweetness of Wispelwey. In the same category with Isserlis, but slightly more beautiful. This is now my desert island version of the Bach Cello Suites."
2,it could have been much better,"We were disappointed in the movie. The acting wasn't bad and it looked as though it had potential but there wasn't enough explaination given as to why this was all happening. Also, there wasn't alot of background/relationship information given Layla and her brother/mate.I guess it is suppose to be suspenseful because of the lack of information provided?? The fear of the unknown...I don't know but it just seemed lacking without it.A guy and girl who are brother and sister but are oddly intimate apparently go house to house and live in it...why do they do this? The question is never answered.Also, the neighbors, family, friends, ect. never think to report something suspicious? So the duo have been living in peoples' homes and the police has never caught onto them? Oh yeah...they move from place to place frequently....but why they do this is never answered.There are more unanswered ""why"" questions but I don't want to give too much although there isn't much..."
3,different,It was different and worth the watch. Not a big fan of the movie. But need to watch once. Great cast.
4,suspeneful,never knew what was going to happen next. i didnt turn it off so i ues it was good enough compared to half of the other low budget movies on here that i had to fast forward to get to he moral. didnt understand the ending but i can use my imgintion
2,that's ok,sometime boring in movie but good picture dvd than vhs not clearly in movie good active made it no idea add.
1,Boring,This movie lacks substance. The story provides no explanation for why the main characters are killing people. The whole story doesn't make much sense.
3,IT'S PERFECT. IT'S HOME,"Josh (Stephen Moyer) and Alice (Rachel Blanchard) are getting a divorce. They opt to sell their home on their own during a buyer's market. Alice lives in the house. David does not. Alice gets the feeling someone is in her house. This was a well shot good creepy scene with the proper music. You could sense her anxiety as she calls around for her girlfriend. Unfortunately it doesn't last and the next thing we know Alice is a prisoner in her own home...during open house. David (Brian Geraghty) is our clean cut intruder who looks like a prospective buyer. Based on early events and conversations, things are a bit strange as a mystery develops. Who are these people? What do they want? Why this house and couple?Bad girl Tricia Helfer as Lila provides the token eye candy. Brian Geraghty has got that Anthony Perkins creep working for him.F-bombs, no nudity, dry humping, women kissing"
2,Doesn't do the job,"I found these nearly worthless for drying dishes. They are not absorbent enough. I gave these two stars only because you can use them for something besides dishes, and because one towel in the set is a thick, loose weave that actually absorbs water."
4,Great looking and nice to embroider on,"These look very nice, expensive, and feel nice. I embroidered on them for gifts and they came out beautifully. (you can see the embroidered towels on my personal site [...]UPDATE: I've since ordered several of the other brands in the same price range and they can't compare to these. For the price, it's a very good value and I plan on purchasing other colors as well as more of these. I should have given them FIVE stars!"
1,Not worth buying,These towels come out of the dryer so wrinkled you can hardly fold them. They also don't absorb well. I would not recommend these or buy them again. Not even sure why I gave one star.
3,Basic towels,"Nice set of extra towels. I'm using two of them for decoration. They do wrinkle, especially at the edges. There is one fairly absorbant towel in the 5 pack, the rest are pretty thin. I got these for $4.99 as a filler. Not a bad deal for $5.00."
3,Okay towels...,"They look nice,but dont absorb a lot.They do get better with each washing however, so dont give up immediately!!"
5,Exactly what I expected,"These towels came just as pictured and match the setting perfectly. They were a little stiff out of the package, but once washed came out nice and soft. Good price, shipped when promised, very satisfied."
2,please dont read this,In Vienna a town witch has been peaceful until the nazi come and invade it in this town there are two best friends inge and lieselotte they have been friends since the first grade but there is a problem inge is a Jew and lieselotte is not but when lieselotte family has to move inge wants to stay friends but lieselottes dad and brothers are nazis and don't want them to stay friends but they are determined to keep there friendship alive.
5,Best Friends Stick Together!,"Hi, Girls! This was my FAVORITE book when I was a kid. I am now 34, and I recently found my old copy of it. I started reading, and couldn't put it down, even though I read it several times when I was younger and still remembered every detail.If you've ever had a best friend move away, or had a friend that your parents didn't like, you'll be able to relate to the ""Blood-Sister"" heroines, Lieslotte and Inge. If you're curious about the life of ordinary girls during the Nazi era, this book will fascinate you.The book is MUCH better than the movie adaptation, ""A Friendship In Vienna,"" which left out the most interesting part of the story: Lieslotte's experiences after she moved to Germany. Imagine going to a school where you have FIVE hours of Gym, every day!"
1,Arrived defective,"Received the watch today in the mail and it turned out to be defective. The display goes blank when I try to use the backlight and the backlight doesn't work either. Contacted the seller for a return or refund, will see how quickly they get back."
2,hard to understand,"I dont want down this book, its complicated to understand for a small book, I'd rather read Dolores Cannon's writting on this stuff, it more understandable."
1,Word of Caution,"I read this book in earnest and must concur with other reviewers who warn readers. I read this over a week, and during that time had strange, terrible nightmares. My sense is that there is enough truth in it to make the reader vulnerable to what is at best a ""flat"" message, and at worst something to be avoided altogether."
3,Will pay for this in the next life,How can you trust a man that takes another mans writings (Talmud Jmmanuel)and says its his. Is this a man of a good spirit that is trying to teach us to be spiritual? I give it 3 stars because the messages of peace is good but writen by a poor soul.
2,A Trickster of a book,"I have no doubt the author was channeling information from somewhere else, but I do have a doubt that the information is all true. When I read through the book I found that it was filled with some truth and some distortion. I felt no love emanating from the book, only a kind of feeling of conspiracies and lunacy. God is all love and I did not feel that with this book. I did however feel love and peace with David R. Hawkins books: ""Power vs. Force"", ""The Eye of the I"", and ""I""."
1,Incorrect paper size information!,"I have been wondering why the A0,A1, and A2 paper size listed on page 52 did not jive with the Autocad prints I was compositing in Adobe InDesign. the metric dimensions listed that was using to make conversions were incorrect. Listed for A0 is 841 x 1198, it is actually 841 x 1189. A1 is listed as 610 x 914, it is actually 594 x 841. A2 is listed as 914 x 1219, is actually 420 x 594. WOW How could you mess this up??? This is a semi-easy mistake to spot if you are familiar with the standard sizes of paper."
2,"Only very basic information, not intended for professionals!","I am a licensed architect, and have been in professional practice now for 15 years. I thought this book was going to offer me some of the common reference tables I need, or perhaps some of the general ADA measurements that must be exact, but it fell well short of my expectations.It's not really suitable for anyone in the design profession, and I think much of the book is littered with detailing and CAD standards that are not necessary for your normal do-it-yourselfer or home builder. I think it may be appropriate for architecture students, however, it really does not have sufficient information to instruct students, and much of the material selection information and detailing is flat elementary."
5,Great little reference!,"This is a wonderful little reference book of architectural data, something like what you would imagine Graphic Standards would be if you reduced it to its most useful 10%, and organized it better. The material is clear, concise, and beautifully presented. In fact a book so graphically striking and thoughtful is fairly rare for a reference book.I think the book would be useful to have around any office, but because of the introductory or foundational nature of some of the material (for example how to lay out a drawing sheet, numbering conventions) I think the book would be most useful to an architecture student or intern."
1,Extremely overpriced for what you get.,"The trick shots are amazing....to watch. The talking, and talking, and interviews, are a complete waste of time. This DVD is worth about 12 bucks and no more. Over half the video is just senseless yapping. The trick shots are just for show and not actually being taught to you."
4,Crucial Brazilian rock'n'roll,"Cazuza""Codinome"" (Box Set)(Universal-Brazil, 2004)--------------------------------------A 7-CD import box set which gathers all the albums by this Brazilian rock pioneer -- includes ""Exagerado"" (1985), ""So Se For A Dois"" (1987), ""Ideologia"" (1988), ""O Tempo Nao Para"" (1988), ""Burguesia"" (1989) and ""Por Ai"" (1991), as well as a tribute album, ""Codinome Cazuza"", featuring the likes of Gal Costa, Cassia Eller, Kid Abelha, Rita Lee, Marina Lima, Ney Matogrosso, Elba Ramalho and others... This is pretty much all of his stuff, other than the earlier albums by his first band, Barao Vermelho albums. One thing that's nice about this collection is that it also includes his first solo album, which came out on a non-Polygram label (Som Livre), so it's a very authoritative collection. If you want to check out Cazuza's work, this is the way to go! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
3,Good But Not Great,I really enjoyed the look at SHAG and his art but the pace of the documentary felt too slow. If you like SHAG's art you'll probably this inside look. The details are interesting and I'd watch it again but look for it at your library first.
3,Look Before You Buy,"I bought a remaindered copy of this book and was so disappointed with the quality of the reproductions (too many of them seemed fuzzy or printed out of register) that I gave it away. That one may have been a fluke. Try to physically inspect the book before you buy, or make sure it's returnable if you don't like it. I admire James Bama's work, though, and this book does show quite a few examples."
4,Sweet,"my BF mentioned that he would like new england sport team towels for his bathroom, and here's one set i ordered, though not all teams have them bummer"
4,"Different, not worse, than science-fiction version.","Readers look in historical novels(which often are long and lumbering)for different qualities than are usually found in science fiction. ""Great Maria"" is a portrait of a culture and era, not as snappy or fast-paced as ""Floating Worlds"" which I found unnecessarily complicated and plot-driven (the author's only science fiction novel, as far as I know). Sadly, too many wonderful Cecelia Holland historical novels are out of print."
3,Not as good as the Science-fiction version,"An interesting historical novel with a feminist angle, strives for accurate historical detail in what seems to be 12th-century Sicily. This novel shares its plot almost exactly with Cecelia Holland's later (?) science-fiction novel ""Floating Worlds"", which is in my estimation one of the great unknown masterpieces in the SF genre.This one doesn't quite take off, though..."
2,Beginner!,"Beginner! HA! In this case beginner is defined as PhD. Mathematics professor. If you don't have a in-depth math background, do not purchase this book."
5,"Loved,loved,loved it!",Absolutely Jaci Burton books! She never fails to bring her characters to life and suck you right into her world! MUST read and so can't wait for the next book!
3,Very sexy book,"I felt like even though it was rushed, it was still a good ""fantasy"" story. I enjoyed it...sexy without being raunchy."
2,Not the best writing skills,I'm used to Lora Leigh's hot romance books so when I read this one it seemed kind of boring. There were some hot scenes but overall the plot & sloryline where lacking something to keep me interested.
3,Paradise awakening,"Well, the book had some good sex scenes but the love story left a lot to be desired. The ending was nice."
1,I don't understand,"I read this book due to the good ratings it had received, and I have to wonder if I read the same book as these other people. The dialog is amateurish, the characters one-dimensional sterotypes, and the sex scenes were boring. It was like reading a Cinemax After-Dark script. I only finished it because I kept thinking, ""It has to get better. It got all those good reviews!"" Now I wish I hadn't. The only good thing about it was that it was free, so at least I didn't waste any money."
5,OMG!!,This book was so wild. Loved the instant attraction and how the book played out in the end. From start to finish this book was both sexy a d romantic making me wanting more all the way though. Great read and left me warm flustered at the end!
4,definitely addictive,"very engaging! read it in record time..close to the Fifty Shades series, but much better written. you won't put this book down for longlong!"
2,Very predictable,The book is a fast read but sooo predictable! I looke at the other two books but didn't buy since the books were really not a continuation of the love story that occurred in the first book. The book ended abruptly for me and I wanted read more about the couple...
2,Ugh,So predictable. Sex scenes were steamy tho. Should just have just written all sex scenes at the resort......yup. fantastic masturbating material.
5,A BOOK WORTH READING,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT WAS A REAL EXCITING BOOK TO READ AND I LOVED THE ENDING. TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
5,My new faovrite author!!,I really enjoyed this story! I love it when I find a new author to read! Jaci Burton is truly gifted! I hightly recommend this book if you need a little spice in your life!!
4,"Juicy, Fun, Enjoyable","This book was a great beach read. It gets your juices flowing!!! A must read! Erotic, Fun, Enjoyable, Juicy & Sexy"
1,If you are searching for a book with no real story this one is it.,I was really disappointed in this book. One of my favorite authors recommended this book & said it was one of her favorites. I guess I just wished there was more of a story line. It was not even remotely believable. Just a very disappointing book as it was literally nothing but sex and now real story.
4,BOTH HOT AND ROMANTIC JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT,I would have given this book 5 stars except it could have been longer. It made me wish that my husband and I were 40 years younger and could have tried out Paradise Island. I enjoyed the character development and their interaction in all situations. I would have enjoyed a longer ending.
4,Definitely for Beginners,"I believe this book would be very helpful for someone who is just beginning to consider printing a book. It is simple and very detailed, and points out the time and effort it takes to get something written and printed. There is lots of practical advice.In my opinion, for those of us who have already ventured into the field, the book is a little simplistic. I hoped to get some helpful hints, but am finding mostly what I already know. So if you are new or just thinking about self-publishing, check it out!"
5,Oops!,"On a personal note to Mr. Carroll, and in response to Mike Swickey's negative review above, this is a good book that new writers would find helpful in spite of the fact that there are glaring copy editing mistakes throughout. Since it contains no advice on working with an editor, my guess is Mr. Carroll perhaps doesn't believe in them, and assumes the self-publisher is up to the task of editing his own work. My advice: ""Good editors make good books better"". Find one."
3,Good Travel Stroller--Light and reclines-Bad customer service,This is our second stroller. We decided to buy it cause we go for long walks and our baby likes to nap. She was at the time only 3 mo and it was important for us that the stroller could recline. This one reclines almost completely. It's a great travelling stroller. It's fairly light but not so compact. But the quality is iffy. I just recently stepped on the wheel and it bent. Poor quality. Called customer services and they were not very helpfull. I ordered a new wheel and it will take 6-8 weeks to arrive!! She said it very matter-of-factly. Thank goodness it's our second stroller and we're not travelling soon. Not only do you have to wait but you certainly have to pay for any damages. I would now give it 2 stars for bad customer service.
2,what study?,"The authors claim it covers the findings of a landmark study funded by the Macarthur Foundation. First of all, only the first 20 pages discuss this study that apparently millions of dollars was spent on. The remaining 180 pages tell us about work done by other people. Their main point, stated blazingly on the cover of the book, is that genes don't matter... what kind of nonsense is that? (And, the Macarthur Foundation had nothing to do with genetics) What makes us who we are anyway??? Who are these guys kidding? I am sure aging can be done well with the right motivation and common sense... but this is not the book to go to for authoritative, well thought through advise."
5,Should be a classic,"The research findings reported in Successful Aging have been supported in a new 20-year study by an independent group of researchers. The study by Becca Levy of Yale Univerisity, et al, was reported in 2002. Simply stated, we can decide now to live longer and better. Having a positive attitude about aging is alone responsible for extending life by 7.5 years, and years of activity and involvment, not suffering. This is a very worthwhile read, despite what some stupid old fools have written before."
4,New perspective,"Easy reading in simple language. Encouraging and uplifting. I love how it details the connection between social inter-actions and quality of life. Really good advice for maintaining independence in old age from a physical and mental perspective. Best of all, there is no pressure to rush out and make special purchases. I am getting copies as gifts for siblings - worth reading."
2,Successful Aging,"This book is not only helpful for us who are aging but for those who are giving care to aging relatives or friends. We are to keep going strong not giving up work, daily tasks, family and friend relationships until a ""have to"" situation occurs. There are helpful suggestions to our aging successfully."
3,Good value. A couple issues.,"This is a good value for a set of 10 fairly large organizer trays. I have 2 complaints. They don't stack evenly; you have to offset them one notch front to back. Also, they arrived filthy, all covered in some kind of dust."
2,lost space,"Lots of wasted space because of the 'corrugations' on the inside of the compartment. I guess this would add strength if you're stacking them, but for me it amounted to lost space. Careful if you're counting on all the advertised inside dimension."
4,"Solidly built bins, easy stacking, could be a bit harder plastic","I have a small computer store and needed some sort of stacking bin system in order to tame the mess of parts and cords I had laying around. These bins are big enough to put most of the parts in and they stack nicely. They also have a nice flat front spot for attaching labels. These aren't the nicest stackable bins I've seen, but they are cheap and work well enough. The plastic feels sorta flimsy, but other than that they are fine."
2,immature pulp,"After being blown away by DIFFERENT CLASS and THIS IS HARDCORE, I went out and got this.... A major mistake, in retrospect. Very, very lame stuff. I don't even want to know what their even earlier records must sound like...."
4,His 'n' Hers,"His 'n' Hers being Pulp's 1994 release and is commonly seen as their major breathrough album. Songs that stand-out on this release are ""Lipgloss"", ""Babies"" and ""Do You Remember The First Time?"". The booklet is quite simple and nice with a nice portrait by Philip Castle, All the lyrics are included and we get a nice list of what the band members play on this release. 4/5."
4,"A sassy, sexy and sarcastic lost classic!","His n Hers is one of the albums of the 90's. I think it overshawdows the likes of other Pulp recordings such as: This is Hardcore and Different Class. His n Hers is basically a whole album epic and it ranges though many feelings and topics. Pulp frontman 'Jarvis Cocker' uses the most beatiful yet freaky style of vocal i have herd. Songs like ""Do you remember the first"" and ""pink Glove"" are songs we all can relate to and feel the emotions that Jarvis and the band are trying to portray though these poppy and sweet tunes. There are a few mood swings in the album from a nice eroticly charged ""Babies"" to the freaky and disjointed ""She's a Lady"". His n Hers only lacks in the song ""Someone like the Moon"" other than that a wonder."
5,WARNING: This is not a radio friendly album.,"My favorite album by my favorite band. Different class was an amazing album, but I must say that His N' Hers is by far my favorite Pulp record. It has all the drama that makes Pulp Pulp. Pulp represents an entire scene, a subculture if even. You'll either love it, or hate it..."
5,A CLASSIC IS BACK!,"This is a must-have album for any true hip-hop fan. Mantronik's production was truly ahead of its time. As with the sound of hip-hop in the mid to late eighties, the songs contain plently of 808 and 909 drum kicks and snares. This was probably one of the most underappreciated albums in the culture. I'm glad to see it's back. We can only hope that Warlock will reprint 'Music Madness' and Capitol will reprint 'In Full Effect'."
5,Ahead of their time,"This was definately a record ahead of it's time. It brings back memories, but let's not go there. If you have never listened to MANTRONIX, but like current hip hop this would be a good choice. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!"
1,"CHRISTIAN CASTRO CD ""ORO""",I HAVE NOT RECIEVED IT YET!!!!!! I SEND A EMAIL AND IT SAID IT WAS ON ITS WAY!!!! I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE UNTIL NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Magic for the Heart,"What David Copperfield does with illusion, Schlatter has done with this collection of stories. True Magic! I started reading this book and didn't set it down until I'd finished the whole thing. What a delightful and heart warming book of stories and essays. It is like Chicken Soup for not just the Soul, but also the Heart, Mind, Body and Spirit. Whether it was the tributes like I AM A TEACHER, the motivating stories like THE FINEST STEEL GETS SENT THROUGH THE HOTTEST FURNACE, the common sense thinking of DECLARATION OF RIGHTS FOR TEENAGERS, the clever insites of CHILDREN, ADULTS, & MONOPOLY or the humor of HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY MAKE YOURSELF MISERABLE, I was captivated throughout."
5,Great,"The product I purchased as being ""Beyond Paradise by Estee Lauder For Men"" was received and described as stated and I am very pleased with it."
4,Trance music / Africa,This kind of musics connects to the tribal environment wich can found in Africa making it you easier to connect to old wisdom annd acient powers of the shamans
5,Dance joy into your life,Very easy to listen to and I felt moved to dance & play from the first few cords. Fantastic addition to dance journey work that I have begun & alows me to work on my own & at home if I choose.Enjoy!
5,Don't leave home without it!,"To know your craft is power. Having read Sheila's book, studied with Sheila for 6 years, moved to Nashville as a songwriter, and written with hit songwriters in Nashville for the last 7 years, I cannot imagine being a songwriter without this book. It has inspired me, taught me, and is always there to refer to time and again. I believe every serious songwriter would benefit from this book. Sheila is a songwriter who knows her craft and has laid it all out in this easy to read, easy to follow, inspiring book. Go on, get the power!"
5,great insight into lyricwriting and the creative process!,"If you want the nuts and bolts of lyricwriting at your fingertips this is it. Not only does this book touch on the subject of lyricwriting but the creative process as well. My lyrics have become more focused and structured and writers block is a thing of the past. Also the references made to other authors, books and songwriters has turned me on to a whole new world of literature. My greatest fear as a lyricwriter is to have my work rejected because I overlooked a fundamental lyricwriting principle. ""The Craft of Lyricwriting"" has eliminated this fear."
2,Hmmm,"If you listen to the radio you'll discover that there are no rules, no rhyme (so to speak) or reason, to successful songwriting. It helps to be lucky, well-connected, etc. Fate is fickle. If you want to be a GOOD lyric writer; that's different. Practice writing prose as well as lyrics; listen to good lyrics--analyze them.Recommended: ""The Moviegoer"" by Walker Percy (not to teach you lyric writing, silly!)"
4,Good Reference,"After reading the book and reading my lyrics, it was quite a revelation. Changed how I approached writing, which was not easy at first but gettingbetter every day."
2,Obscure . . .,"Maybe I'm just too young, but I became frustrated with the references to obscure songs from the roaring 20's. Most of the lyrical references in this book are before 1950. Surely there are some modern songs containing good lyrics, right? The book reads like a reference book, and is quite preachy. Not a joy to read. I suggest ""88 Songwriting Wrongs, and How to Right Them""."
5,Easy way to customize your Chevy.....,"This is an easy and inexpensive way to customize your Chevy in your own way. The fit on the vehicle is as perfect as it can get! To install them all you do is peel the cover off of the adhesive strips, and stick these covers on the trucks tail lights. Easy as it gets!"
3,For dedicated EN fans only,"This album is not for those who are just staring to get into EN. Unless you are really into german industrial noise this album is rather difficult to listen to straight through. If you are a long time fan of EN and wish to hear where they are coming from and how they evolved into what they are today then you need this album ,but even then you might find yourself skipping through tracks.I rated it 3 stars mainly because I'm really into EN ,and enjoyed the history lesson."
4,If you're into jazz ...,"If you know how to interpret jazz as being the only 'real' music, than you'll love this kind of music."
1,noise,this stuff sounds like some kids beating on garbage cans in the alley. I didn't car for it to much.
1,What a joke,"You have GOT to be kidding! This is as much removed from the definition of music as would be hanging out at the local steel plant - without ear protection. Why not just move to some industrial area in your neighborhood and have this ""sound"" all the time?"
3,"not their best, but definitely not horrible","there are some incredible tracks, but as a whole this is not very consistent...if you've never heard EN i would suggest ""halber mensch"" or ""drawings of patient o.t.""...if your looking for EN at their harshest and most primitive, this is the album you need though. honestly i would say this for dedicated fans only."
5,strategies against depression,"`back in 88 this stuff sounded so horrible, german kids nihilisticaly banging on dying machinery, but now in my 50s all I hear is their youthful exuberance. Buy this for anyone having problems with depression, it will help them."
3,Bistro cooking,A good book for those who like French Bistro fare. More difficult to get some of the meat cuts in the common US grocery store meat market. Have a butcher make the cuts for you. There are interesting tips on Bistro life and cooking in France that make the book worth buying. Important to buy fresh ingredients which may take some time extra at the market.
2,Disappointed,"Having enjoyed Ms Wells ""Trattoria"" for years, I decided to order ""Bistro Cooking"" based on its many favorable reviews. It's not the book that ""Trattoria"" is. The recipes are more difficult and the ingredients often call for special shopping. These differences may just be the difference between French and Italian cooking, but differences they are."
2,Basic bistro eats,"Very basic advice: a roast beef and tomato sandwich with creme fraiche for example. Simple recipes with thrifty cuts of meats for stews, soups (just add liquid!) along with many potato recipes (with more creme fraiche) from well-known and obscure bistros throughout France. Note: quiche is called 'tarte' here with no cross reference. Salads with anything you'd put into a sandwich, oil and vinegar dressing. Good new-cook gift or a quick read for the armchair traveler but I expected more from this famous food writer."
5,bistro cooking,"This book is a classic of simple French Soul Food recipes. So far I've tried about one third of the recipes without a disappointment. And not a single trip the local botique market for pricey, exotic ingredients. The descriptions of how Patricia found these gems adds further warm and fuzzies."
5,Indispensable,"Honestly, for the average home cook, having this is more useful than having Mastering the Art of French Cooking (I am a BIG Julia Child fan, but generally I just don't have the time to make her recipes, wonderful as they are). The vast majority of the recipes here are both uncomplicated and inexpensive. (There are a few exceptions, of course, but it's very easy to tell which ones they are.) There's a whole chapter of potato recipes--what can be better than that? We usually have a few extra copies on hand to give as gifts after dinner parties. If we cook out of this book, our guests invariably want the recipes, and it's easier to give them a copy than it is to write them out, especially as used paperback copies can be had ridiculously cheaply. No serious cook should be without this book (or her book on trattoria cooking, which performs the same function for everyday Italian cooking)."
5,Puppy life saver,This milk right hear saved our dogs when they were puppies and helps them transition into eating puppy food and was wonderful for the mom to keep up with the added nutrients she needed for nursing.
2,very disappointing after reading the other reviews,The title offers a lot but unfortunately this book does not deliver much. It may be useful for a 2 week self- defence course but the set self-defence drills are not really guided chaos and are very basic drills in most martial arts' curriculum. Attack Proof and Systema offer much more for the serious martial artist looking for a 'random' system of self defence. I was very disappointed with this purchase.
2,Served their Purpose,I bought these shoes for a specific occasion and they served their purpose for that occasion. The shoes were painful to walk in and left blisters on my feet and have since gone in the trash. These were really cute and I was hoping the quality would be better.
2,The VRML 2.0 Handbook,"As mentioned before by other customers, the URL for the case study cannot be found. This book has been recommended by a professor teaching computer graphics, which is why I purchased it. Not finding this code on the web as promised infuriates me. Time is of the essence in classroom assignments and wasting time searching for something that turns out not to be there is frustrating. SGI, Hartman and Wernecke should be ashamed of themselves."
5,The definitive VRML 2.0 book: gorgeously written and USEFUL!,"There are surprisingly few books which are both accurateand well written. This is one of those few. I've read mostof the VRML books on the market in search of insights, andthis one is clearly written by folks who have them. Kudosto the authors for a clear and USEFUL book about VRML 2.0.I can take their examples and put them to work immediately."
4,Nice set...but packaging...,Great set!! But the packaging was awful......tried to stuff all 10 sets into 2 boxes and almost 1/3 was broken.
3,Lists & illustrates concrete examples of this illusive celeb,"I loved reading this book with my son when he was young. Shabbat is such a difficult holiday to describe to a young child, yet it is the only holiday mentioned in the Ten Commandments. The pictures and examples give many concrete events which can help your child learn to set this day apart."
5,great for beginners,"This guide is for the ultimate beginner who is thinking of being a writer. It covers the very basics of creative writing. She starts the book off by saying anyone can be a writer and the point is to not get intimidated and just do it. She covers the process of writing, the other sections cover fiction, poetry, nonfiction, drama, scripts, and screenplays, she then tells you how to go about selling your work. How to deal with literary agents, contracts, fees, and bookkeeping. There is even a section on contests and grants. In the last chapter the author talks about editors and writer's block. This book is packed with info for the very beginner, so if you're thinking about being a writer and are just starting out then get this book to guide you."
5,Best Help Yet!,"Here's a superb reference book! It's packed with helpful hints for writing better short stories, poetry, plays, and nonfiction. But the winning part tells readers how to make money with all that wonderful writing. How clever to put it all in one book. Now when I meet struggling writers new to the business, I tell them they can find the answers to their questions in this text. And a few weeks later they call and thank me! So thank you, Dr. Rozakis!"
2,Trying to do too many things at once...,"The first part of this book deals with overcoming all the mental obstacles people may have in writing... Once you buy a book on writing it is reasonable to assume that you are determined to write and that the mental obstacles are not your major concern. Further, a lot of the advice given on overcoming obstacles boils down to; at best common sense - at worst being downright ridiculous.In the second part of the book the author tries to cover everything from short stories over poetry to script writing and offers very little advice that readers with an average IQ wouldn't already have figured out themselves.Last part of the book deals with how to sell your work, finding an editor etc. and a substantial part of this is devoted to address lists that are most likely already outdated at the time of printing..Unless you regard yourself as a complete idiot - which I assume that very few aspiring writers do - don't waste your money or time on this book."
1,horrible customer service,"Looking at the reviews,my problem is not a rare occurrence.i received this cd-rom software that was defective. I emailed them 3 times but never got a response. they only responded after a complaint was put through amazon. I wouldn't buy anything else from oc tech."
5,Mavis Beacon Typing Course,This course is really easy and fun to use and my typing speed and accuracy has started to improve almost immediately!
2,The REAL review!!!,"This program is just ""OK"". The bad parts about it are that it is a fairly crappy production in its layout and overall quality. You cant control where you want to go in the lessons for example, once you're past a point where it says ""lets try some new keys!"", and you're like: ""God D*&$#it, I'm not ready for some new F^&#%*@ keys yet!!!!!"", too bad!!! The only way you can go backwards is to start all over from the beginning. Also, the games are extremely crappy and lame. I (or almost anyone) could have made a program 10 times better than this, it could be so much more user friendly and entertaining."
2,Trouble with screen size,"I purchased the Mavis Beacon(Version 17) to increase my typing speed. I don't bother using it much because I have to change the pixel size of my screen to make it small enough to fit. Then the appearance is a little too small for my liking. After my lesson, I have to change the pixel size back again. As a result, I don't bother using it much. Fortunately, I also purchased Typing Instructor Deluxe (Version 17) and I am very happy with it! It is easy to navigate, has very pleasant graffics, lots of variety and features, and loaded up perfectly (Win XP Home). Typing Instructor Deluxe has everything you need and is fun, too!"
3,typing,the program is just ok. i can't seem to make it larger to take up the entire computer scrren. i would prefer the keyboard pic on the program to be much larger.
4,Beacon typing tutor,My daughter used this product and found it useful.The first shipment of the product had a flaw in it but AMAZON corrected the product with a replacement item. I was satisfied with the procedures for replacement.
5,The best typing software ever!!!!,"Once I started using Mavis Beacon my typing skills went up.On first it took me forever to finish a sentence,but now since I started using Mavis Beacon I'm an execellent typer.Thanks to Mavis Beacon!!!"
3,Good for improving speed and that's about all,"I was familiar with this product before I purchased it because a friend had a copy on her computer. So I knew it would help with improving my speed, however, it is a little harder to fix finger placement on the keyboard, which is what I wanted to work on. And while the practice lessons did offer some guidance re. finger placement, its not enough. And, there isn't much variety with the games and lessons, so I found myself remembering the lessons and typing from memory as opposed typing from the screen."
1,"Buggy, Unstable, and Tech Support is Zero",Almost new PC with Windows XP and all upgrades. This program purchased and won't even run. Borderbound's tech support is pathetic - basically nothing at all on this product.We have never had a problem with any other program running on this Dell computer.I would not recommend this at all. It's a paperweight and a total waste of money. Can't speak to features since it won't even run.
1,Flawed product,"Unable to load (multiple attempts) successfully into either Windows XP or Vista. Corrupted. Avoid this product or if you have to buy it, get it from a local retailer so it will be easy to return."
4,"Works well, but not perfect","This program does a great job of teaching typing. My 8th grade daughter has voluntarily worked with it daily for the past two weeks. She has gone from 35 wpm to 50 wpm (adjusted) in that two weeks. My 11th grade son uses it, too, but his typing skills are weak and only slowly improving (from 10 to 12 wpm). My complaint is about the manuscript training; we cannot figure out where the manuscript is that the students are to be copying from. If the program showed where to find them to print them out for the lesson, this would get 5 stars."
3,"Good, but could be better","I learned typing in 7th grade, the old fashioned way, but I liked the idea that this program, for my daughter, would be similar, going over the home keys, and teaching positioning. I find, however, that this program doesn't go over things enough to practice them. The games that are stuck in are just annoying, and not fun at all. My daughter is so frustrated with not going over the letters enough before advancing, and the stupid games, that she is often in tears. However, she is 11 years old, so take that as you will.I did find, however, that the program was very good at picking up what I needed to work on, which is numbers."
5,Santana Brothers,"Years ago a friend lent me this CD, I made of cassette tape but always was looking for the CD. Finally got it! This is one of my 10 CD's to have on a deserted island; could listen to it over and over. It has the sound of Carlos Santana but some twist with the help of his brother and cousin. It's a great CD to listen to on the deck on a summer evening."
1,"Jorge leads, Carlos follows, Carlitos sits on it.","The review title basically describes the album. Jorge's soulful tone and elegant improvizations are at the heart of this album's sound. Pieces like Blues Latino, Morning in Marin, and Aranjuez, all have his stamp. Interesting that they are not written by the performers. The utterly forgettable rest of the album are more Carlos' style. Two of his pieces stick out like a sore, pulsating thumb - the opener and the bizzarre The Trip (to musical la-la land?). As for the little Carlitos... well, his dental-drill guitar is terribly restricted stylistically and inept musically, and his only composition is not going anyplace in particular (except maybe the rubbish basket). So we are left with Jorge to save the day. Is it not ironic that he is virtually unknown? Una puente para Jorge, nada para los otros, pardon my Spanish."
2,What were you thinking?,I am baffled by this CD. I love Carlos Santana and even have a certain affinity for Jorge ( I was the one who bought the Malo stuff) and I appreciate that they wanted to give their relative a break but this is crap! I have tried to listen to it and I have tried to appreciate it but it has worked it's way the the bottom of my Santana stack.
3,Nice change of pace,"I like this cd because it definately stays away from the corny vocal based tunes Santana had been making for some time, and unfortunately continues to make. Most of the songs were written by Jorge Santana and he proves himself to be a competent song writer, but the soulful guitar playing mostly keeps it above musak or fusak. The first song transmutation is kind unusual and leans toward speed metal.My favorite tune is definately thoughts, it make me feel like I'm parasailing on a clear day in Seattle,I have not felt that since Caravanserai. El aranjuez has a nice feel, but I really don't like that antiseptic sounding synthesizer effect. El brujo and the trip are for guitar freaks, and it ends with the beautiful morning in Marin.Maybe Carlos will give us real fans something more in this vein again."
4,"3 Family Members, One Great Cd","Three members of Carlos Santana's family come together to make this great cd, the cd by Carlos, his brother Jorge, and their cousin is a great instrumental find. The cd features all three of these guys trading off licks on their guitars. Great Album!"
3,A call for editing,"Like its predecessor, Exile's Song, The Shadow Matrix is a decent story that is severely undermined by misspellings and horrible grammar. Plus, you know it's bad when even the author can't keep track of all of the character names (Mikhail's brothers are twice called ""Lanart-Alton,"" and shouldn't ""Lanart"" be after ""Hastur"" anyway?). Did anyone actually edit this book, or did it go straight from MZB (& friends) to the printing press? These problems were very distracting and kept the book from being otherwise enjoyable."
3,reminds me of a soap opera,"The latest enstallment in the Darkover series was mediocre at best. The author relied too much on the characters and their stagnant relationships rather than plot. It took too long to reveal an uncreative ending. The meat of the novel, the male and female leads' relationship, reads like a ""trashy"" romance novel. Very dissatisfying."
3,Please tighten the stories up!,"I have and have read all of the Darkover series up until this on an enjoy them all. I enjoyed Exile's Song quite a bit, though it did seem a little different from MZB's usual style. The first half of this book is simply told in order to set up the second part of the book...if there was any reason for it at all. Personally, I could have lived with the first half being told in only one or two chapters. This might have actually created some excitement to that story instead of a boring tedium. The second half of the book, though, was as good as Exile's Song. It's not good enough for me to add this book to my collection, though."
2,Attempt to stuff two novellas in one book.,"The first half of the book is only tangentially connected to the second, and I'm being generous here."
4,Not quite as good as Exiles song,This book had a few dragging plot points but overall it was still quite worth reading
3,Bland - not as involving as other Darkover novels.,"While it was still Darkover, and I enjoy reading all of the Darkover novels, I was disappointed with this book. Dialog was bland, development of characters was superficial, and the end just seemed to have been slapped on because it had to have some kind of ending.Glad I waited for the pocket version to come out and didn't spend 20 bucks on the hardcover."
4,Ashara,"This book tells us why Ashara was so bent on crushing Margaret, which would explain a lot of other things like in ""The Heritage of Hastur"" and ""Exile's Song"""
5,It is one of the best books that I've read recently.,I love this book. It was a real joy to read. This book really devopled some of the minor charcters in Exile's Song. I loved all of it!!
1,Disappointing entry in Darkover series,"Having been a Bradley and Darkover fan for years, I was greatly disappointed in this latest offering. It lacked the character depth and richness of all of the others; very superficial."
5,I Enjoyed This Book,"I liked it b/c its small and easy to carry, which makes it a great reference and it discusses herbs in combinations which is useful"
5,Tremendous!,"I had never listened to Aterciopelados before, and I don't speak Spanish fluently. Neither of these points was an obstacle to my enjoying this great CD.I love all the songs. While there are electronic touches, the overall feel is acoustic and natural with a definite ""Latin"" flavor. Her singing is very heartfelt. Best of all, the CD is free of the sonic ""sheen"" that seems to dull most recordings these days. There's a crispness and clarity to the sound and singing that is like a breath of fresh air.If I had to find a fault, it would be the hidden track. It's a lame remix of ""A Eme O"" that doesn't fit with the feel of the rest of the tracks.More and more over the last few years, I've found myself looking to musicians outside the US and on independent labels to deliver the quality music I need. Everything on US major labels is either Britney-esque or sounds (and smells) like ""My Humps."" If you relate and need an escape, then I strongly recommend this CD!"
3,GREAT CD !,"I really enjoyed listening to this CD, its very refreshing and comforting; it includes very interesting rhythms and acoustic sounds delightful to hear. I think Andrea is a great artist. A+"
3,"pleasant, but not nearly as good","I won't say I'm a fan of everything Aterciopelados has done. In fact, I don't much like their older stuff. But I do consider their more recent CDs, Gozo Poderoso and Caribe Atomico, to be fantastic discs. Even after several years, I still listen to them often. I was very much looking forward to their next disc. Instead, we now have Echeverri on her own. The result is a fairly bland disc. The first few songs start out strong, but from there the CD deteriorates into pleasant, very similar sounding songs that aren't memorable or distinct. It's still nice background music because I enjoy Echeverri's voice, but I wouldn't recommend it for Aterciopelados fans."
3,Pleasant...,"Maybe 2 1/2 stars, actually. A pleasant album, but disappointing to me. I miss the fire and drive of ""Pipa de la Paz"", for example. Has motherhood killed her spirit? Why not step up the tempo for at least a couple of cuts? This becomes almost dreary after a while. Maybe the moms will like it."
2,Andrea Eceverri,"The CD is okay, not fantastic. I missed the punk/folk music that Andrea did with Aterciopelados. She writes/sings a lot about experience with motherhood, which got a little boring. I am a mom myself and did not get that thrilled about pregnancy/nursing, etc. which is what she sings about throughout the CD."
1,Worst album of the year,"This album is horrid, Aterciopelados was a ok band that went from good to worst, in Caribe Atomico they were at their peak creatively, but now this album is nothing more than a shrine to this woman's ego.I would give it zero stars if possible, please better check other options like Julieta Venegas or Ely Guerra, don't waste your money on this."
1,"""I, Sell Out""","Do you what the three biggest mistakes in the history of rock & roll were?1) John Lennon leaving the Beatles to make albums with the inferior Yoko Ono.2) Paul McCartney leaving the Beatles to make albums with the inferior Wings.3) Alan Parsons leaving behind his fans to make an inferior album of lifeless dance tracks, barking dogs, and baby noises.This almost matches John & Yoko's Two Virgins as the most horrible and unlistenable album I have heard in 30 plus years as a rock fan. Major jeers to Alan Parsons for selling out after such a long string of excellent melodic music. Will he ever make good music again? This is so bad that I doubt it. Let's hope that the Moody Blues & Jethro Tull aren't next. After this disasterous letdown anything seems possible."
5,Forging A Valid Path Into The Future,"Alan Parsons has never been one to conform to traditional album format or currently popular genre melding. Rather, as the title of this new disc suggests, he moves alone down a path of his own choosing, ever changing, ever strivng, always uniquely intriguing. Here Parsons toys with everything from drum loop club beats to dissonant jazz fusion as he pushes the envelope of his own invention even further down the path of musical experimentation. Interestingly, while forging ahead into new areas of computer-oriented composition and production, Parsons twice looks back along the way to see just where it is that he has come from, and the perspective of that vista shows us all just how far he has traveled over the last three decades. As always, very highly recommended for anyone with an open mind as well as open ears."
4,"Could be better, but then again, maybe it can't.","Well, it's been a very long time for AP fans to wait. Is this album worth it? Hardcore fans will love this album. For the most part, AP has kept up with the times. David Gilmour is a pleasant surprise, and a very welcome addition. They could have left track two in the ""better not use it"" file. The instrumentals are worth the price, but the vocals are lukewarm, at best. Add this to your collection, if only because the instrumentals are great!"
1,Horrible Release!,"There is really not much to write about this. I cannot believe that AP project could get into these waters and sink so low. A horrible CD, better forgotten as soon as possible. I still don't understand the rational behind this release. Why do people like AP need to reinvent themselves...A totally catastrophic release that will leave a dark shadow on an impecable career."
3,Valid Path is.......,"Valid path is interesting. But, That's all. To be honest, I was disappointed at first, because I was expecting the music to be comparable to TIME MACHINE or ON AIR. I really miss the signature Ian Bairnson guitar. Check out ""Ignorance Is Bliss"" What a fantastic SONG!! Some of the other longtime Band Associates are missing as well. Electronic music is OK but, not a favorite of mine. This CD is Interesting but, previous CD'S are better!"
2,A disappointing introduction,"This was my first introduction to the work of Alan Parsons. I am not really a prog enthusiast, but rather someone who quite likes classic Yes and who has been into electronic music for about 10-12 years. I founf this album fairly disappointing. Most of the album is derivative and lacklustre. I'm sure for APP fans who haven't listened to much electronic music this probably seems fresh and vibrant, but from someone approaching it from the other side, it is anything but. For someone who is interested in seeing how another progressive musician made the crossover to doing electronic music, I'd encourage you all to check out what Robert Fripp (formerly of King Crimson and others) has been doing with some of his side projects with Brian Eno and also the FFWD project with Alex Paterson of The Orb. Also recommended: System 7, with Steve Hillage's wonderful guitar work."
1,AWFUL,"Absolute techno crap. This is just electronic dribble with no emotion or feeling; obviously released ONLY for commercial purposes. There is no concept here, the bass is overblown. This is a great album for a noise war with your neighbors or if you want to get thrown out of your apartment. Otherwise, it's a worthless piece of junk."
1,oh dear oh dear,"just as genesis should have quit while ahead and avoided the very average calling all stations, alan parsons should have stuck to what he's good at, instead of producing this batch of mind numbing repetetive dirge.Yes there is a market for this kind of stuff but he should leave it to those who are better at it.His albums over the years have been classics but if you were expecting the same you will be very dissapointed.There is nothing more embarrasing when someone who patently isnt, trys to be hip.What a sad episode in an otherwise brilliant career"
5,Awesome!,"Being a long time AAP fan this was a very welcome release. From the get go this CD grabbed me with ""Return to Tunguska"". The tie ins back to previous CD's with ""Mammagamma"" and the ""Return to a Dream Within A Dream"" are good for nostalgia's sake. ""Chomolungma"" is a great way to end the CD.To AAP - Thanks for this release. I hope to see more from you."
4,Alan Parsons goes Electronica..,"Think Alan Parsons meets the Chemical Brothers. Take Parson's hypersonics and merge them with electronica, dance sensibilities. Old time Parsons fans will need to listen an extra time or two to get it. Very cool album. David Gilmour soars on ""Trunguska"", Parsons himself sings a fine lead vocal on ""We Play the Game"".""Mannagamma"" a riff on his earlier ""Mammagamma"" actually succeeds better than the original.And ""Chomolunga"" with John Cleese, is well.. classic quirky Alan Parsons. Extraordinary sound engineering as you might expect. I would put this in the upper half of Parson's albums overall. Not the best, but certainly far better than some of his early efforts. Highly recommended for die hard Parsons fans, who are flexible enough to appreciate trance and electronica variations on the Parsons approach to music."
4,Transition,"This album is the definition of a great potential that needs some time. AP is transitioning his music by synthesizing different sub genres of electronic music into it.Some songs are very exciting but some leave a mild disappointment - most of which are related to the content, or at some places even the existence, of the lyrics, and sometimes the bitter taste of a mixture done with not so right proportions.Failures of the album, in my opinion, are; More Lost Without You and You Can Run (lyrics spoil them so much that they feel like recorded with only Billboards in mind); Mammogamm 04 (that distorted mumbling thingy with turntable shifts killed the whole song); Tijuanic (pace does not fit in).Yes there are some bad apples but you should listen to this album! Because other than the failure songs, this album is full of pleasure and it will keep you waiting for more, dreaming about how AP will come up with something even better."
1,I bought....I played.....,...it sucked....and I returned it!That's about all I can say about the album. There is nothing redeemable about this album. What an inferior album from an artist of superior talent!!!
5,Well worth the wait,"Best description of my reaction, WOW! After the departure of Eric Woolfson from The Project, and the long wait for a new release, and word that Alan was going in a new direction with his new release, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Well, Alan never disappoints! While his new CD is nothing like the Project albums I've loved in the past, it still has the Parsons signature on it, and is very addictive. I've not been able to take it out of my CD player since the first playing, and have listened to it perhaps 20 times since. Every listening is just as enjoyable as the first. Fans will rank this as one of his best.UPDATE: THREE MONTHS after purchasing this CD, I STILL listen to it. I've ripped it to my PC hard drive so I can easily listen while I'm working at home, it's on my zip drive so I can take it to work, it's on my iPod so I can listen to it while I workout at the gym, and I made an extra copy for the car... Obssessed? Yeah, maybe... But I can't get it out of my head!"
4,Worth the risk,"I wasn't sure of the concept, but AP has always delivered so I gave it a try.I'm impressed. Guest musicians include David Gilmour with a dissonant, high end guitar, Crystal Method backing Alan Parsons as he handles vocals as well as he does live--I always wondered what he'd sound like in the studio (Good. Like everything else he does). There's even an odd bit with John Cleese.The music is cerebral and surreal, electronic but not repetitive or trance. It's definitely rock, with an edge. Mostly somber, but not depressing. Alan delivers the goods once again."
5,The Third Greatest Parsons Albumn!,"All you true Parsons fans, just disregard all the negative reviews about this albumn! Believe me, its their third greatest (after Tales... & On Air) effort!!"
4,PARSONS PREVAILS,"While not as perfect as some of AP's classic albums, A VALID PATH is a welcome addition to his discography.As noted in earlier reviews, Alan's exploration of electronica is a perfect fit for his expertise. The instrumental tracks are the strongest tracks, while the vocal tracks are not special--just okay enough not to ruin the collection.As always, Parsons' knack for subtle layering and creative repetitions is in full force here.I've got all of Parsons' original classics, and this one receives a special welcome---only wish he'd make more with his old crew."
3,Alan Parsons goes electronic?,"Yes, this definitely has an electronic sound, it's a new sound for Alan Parsons. If you don't like electronic music, then you might have a problem with this. Personally, I like electronic music okay, and I don't see anything sacrilegious about this CD. There are three tracks that I particularly like. Mammagamma 04 and A Recurring Dream Within A Dream are both overhauls of classic Alan Parsons tunes. I wouldn't want a whole CD full of retreads, but I found these two changed enough to make them sound fresh again. The other track that especially sticks with me is the last one, Chomolungma. This is probably the least electronic sounding track, but is very proggy and in fact sounds to me like something that should have been on Pyramid. I like Pyramid a lot, and I like this track. Aside from these three tracks, the rest of the sounds less inspired but not unpleasant to me. I call this CD not a great effort, but a pretty good one on the whole."
1,Could not believe my ears,"I simply could not believe my ears that this was an Alan Parson recording. After all the years of producing albums with wonderful melodies, I was left stuned by my disapointment at this effort. The new instumentals are almost devoid of melody or buried under techo noise. The reworked old stuff vastly inferior to the original. The vocals..well to tell the truth, I don't remember much about them as nothing could save this ""work"". If you're as big a fan as I am, you will ignore this and buy it anyway, but this is not anything like he has done before and I pray like anything he will do again."
3,Interesting but short lived,"Context: Big AP fan going back to 1976. Bottom line: Interesting effort but with only 9 songs (including 2 remakes), not enough music to consider an above average AP disc. The remakes are quite good. The rest of the music different enough to make it listenable. If you are an AP fan, get it. If not, wait for the used discs to show up."
1,What happens when you take X-tascy and go to a Euro disco...,"Ugh! I have been an AP fan since 1976's ""I Robot"" and I have suffered through highs (""Eye in the Sky"") and lows (""Ammonia Avenue""), but nothing can prepare you for this shock... and I was so looking forward to a new Alan Parsons CD...What a mess. If AP was trying to make Dance club music, he's failed. Others do it better.Painful to listen to... arrangements are all over the place. Nothing memorable or melodic here. After listening to ""Vital Path"", just to remember how good things used to be, I had to listen to ""There Must Be More"" from ""Try Anything Once"" to re-affirm my faith in Alan Parsons abilities. Very disappointed."
2,Let's see...85% Invalid Path...,"I'm not sure of the percentage, but a good deal of this is just plain crap. You who buy it, even you Parsons fans, get your can openers out to open the can because that is what you are going to get--Canned Music. I give it two stars because there is one pretty decent song, but one pretty decent song does not make an album. If you are into electronica and not musicians playing real instruments, you will really enjoy this probably. If you respect a little electronica, like me, but prefer to hear a lot of real instruments that Bairnson and the others used to provide, go to the back catalog of Parsons."
2,Onward with progress........,"In 1979, I first heard I Robot. That album (at its time was way ahead of itself). I guess you could say it was new electronic. All of APP and AP albums have helped me through hard times in my life. It seemed as though when I was growing Alan Parsons was growing. I have read all of the above rates and I have to say that I am disapointed. I guess I am too old now. If I was young and going to Rave's, then this music might come close to something I was looking for. I get the feeling that Alan's son had a lot to do with this CD. I will buy the next AP CD. However, I am 43 now and my party days are over. I guess Alan needs to key into the new younger crowd. I am saddened by this CD. Too electronic/techno for me...."
1,A Not-So-Valid Path,"As an Alan Parsons devotee all the way back to Tales of Mystery and Imagination, I had never had to apologize for buying one of his CDs. Finding a new Parsons CD in the store was an unexpected gift and an automatic buy until now. I know that some albums have been weaker than others, but there have always been at least 1 or 2 strong tracks that make the whole album worth listening to. Not so with this effort. The usual and expected skilled use of synthesizers and vocals to create textures within the songs has been obscured by so much techno-clutter that it is difficult to recognize the themes. This is especially true in the two tracks that were updated or recycled for this album (3, 7). The fact that this is the first time I've ever felt the need to write a review demonstrates the level of my disappointment. I hope your experience will be better than mine."
2,"Sub ""Par""sons","First, let me say that this is NOT a ""Project"" album. Gone are Woolfson, Powell and all who made it a Project. Alan is on his own here. Very well engineered and produced but falls somewhat short in the delivery of the final product. I must say that this CD is disappointing. Not quite what I expected from AP. Only 9 tracks and two are redo's so actually only 7 tracks of new music. Not much for 3 years worth of waiting. The lyrical aspect is overly simplistic and not very catchy. Too many experiments on this to be able to follow what Parsons is trying to say. Instrumentals are hip and more in tune with what we have come to enjoy from Alan. Overall, he doesn't quite seem to know which path is valid but still wants us to follow him. I will follow him and hope that his next album find him on a clear path and off this rocky road that he seems to have found himself on."
3,Valid Transition,"It was perhaps inevitable that Alan Parsons would move into electronica -- so inevitable that perhaps he arrived here too late. In some ways, Alan Parsons is one of the key links between progressive rock (he produced some of Pink Floyd's best work) and electronica (no accident that The Crystal Method pays homage to his influence by walking through this album). This collection works, it is worth the price if you are an Alan Parsons Project fan. I don't know if it is a disappointment, because I'm not sure Alan Parsons has ever had a ""great"" album (although ""I, Robot"" comes close), but this album is certainly not unworthy of his catalog of music."
1,"DISGRACEFUL SELL OUT!!! Why, Alan, Why?","I love art rock. I love Alan Parsons. I Robot, Pyramid, Try Anything Once, Time Machine, they were all brilliant albums. But now PARSONS HAS SOLD OUT TO THE ""CLUB MTV"" GENERATION! Here you will find not one scrap of the depth and tunefullness of the previous albums, just simple-minded kiddie schlock played with the subtlety of a jack hammer! Every song (if these can be called songs) sounds like a clone of all the worst MTV-approved groups. Babies goo goo-ing? Computer gurgles? Distorted voices? Plastic sounding drum machines? IS THIS A JOKE, MR. PARSONS? This is an obvious SELL OUT and a kick in the teeth to all of the fans who have stayed faithful over the years. I'm afraid that I will never again but an Alan Parsons album without sampling it first. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,"A Valid Path - hey, Try Anything Once!","It's very hard for me to write a review about this album without resorting to comparisons, so here they are. ""A Valid Path"" is to Alan Parsons what ""The Division Bell"" was to Pink Floyd.You'll begin to wonder whether this is, in fact, Alan Parsons. Or, were Stuart Elliot, Ian Bairnson, Eric Woolfson and the whole gang what made Alan Parsons tick? Hey, why did Polly Samson write a Pink Floyd song (oh, I got my metaphors mixed, sorry). And that will be the easy part about listening to this album.If you want not to be so shocked about what you'll listen to, I'd strongly recommend to listen to L'Arc En Ciel first, then to Return to Tunguska, and finish it off with Tijuaniac, then listen to the rest of the album. Why? Because I feel that, if you are happily surpried at first, you'll be willing to accept whatever comes next.And believe me, it's nothing short of... well.You'll have to listen to it and make up your mind yourself.Me? Check out my rating..."
1,Slightly better than Marvel's Captain America movie,"Well, after Ultimate Avengers 2 I kinda figured Iron Man would be pretty bad. But I didn't realize how bad.I am assuming Mavel thinks the comic book fans will just buy whatever they release.With cartoons like Justice League, I was pretty shocked that they would give the green light for a story this bad.When it comes to comics, make mine Marvel, when it comes to cartoons, DC is the way to go."
3,Arggg Another RE-MAK!!,"I love Iron Man and have been an avid comic buyer since the mid 80's and Marval has put out some good stuff; however, who ever is writing for there movie/animation dept should be fired.... The orignal story line is butchered, almost as bad as my spelling, and the new story is wipafied.... The Animation is very good and sharp.. Don't get me wrong it was ok and I did not pay too much for it, but if you are a purist you will not enjoy it as much as you could. Please try again and get it done RIGHT..."
1,Animated- who knew...,"Want my money back. Watched and forwarded after 5 min to see if there was a real movie in there. Nope. Maybe story line was good, I don't know because I didn't watch."
3,I AM IRON MAN!,I thought this was a pretty good DVD. I think Marvel does a good job at the animation and also at making it interesting enough for adults and not on an insulting 'kiddy' level. One thing that you will find with these Marvel DVD's (at least the ones I have seen) they are not a 30 minute action fest like you would see on Saturday morning. They are really into telling the story so some might think it moves slowly. I like this cause it is more like a movie and less like a cheap roller coaster ride.
2,Rental only even if you a Iron Man Fan,"If the live action movie didn't release, then this movie might had higher rating, but due to the fact this movie has too much conflict in story line with the live action film, first of all is try to explain the original of Iron Man, but it was very choppy and poor script. Every where you compare to the live action, live action is far better. Ending wasn't as good it didn't focus the main villain. Anyway is only rental for sure."
1,Bait and Switch... clearly an issue with marketing by MARVEL,"I too sat down with my family to watch Iron Man. It was only once opened and the movie started that we realized that this IRON MAN was an animated version.Unfortunately as with most there is a regulation regarding exchanges once the packaging is opened.At least now the price of this annimated cartoon nightmare is $10 dollars less so you might be warned you arent getting what you expect.Good luck with trying to get a credit... I think with speaking to the right customer representative they might realize that with the ""customer satisfaction"" consideration this is an advertising and labelling issue and the customer should not be held liable for such misleading labelling."
2,"Boring storyline, hardly few things to keep back for re-watch.","Having liked the previous animations done by Lionsgate (Avengers 1 & 2), I was expecting something better from this Iron Man production. Unfortunately, the story takes like forever to come to one of its highly anticipated moments (Tony donning the Iron Man suit). Afterwards, there are few moments in the storyline that could really leave you in awe.For my taste, the only parts where I liked what I saw, was some (not all) of the CGI-induced animation, where some of the movements were very life-like.I saw this downer just yesterday, and to tell you the truth, I already forgot pretty much of everything that happened in the story!! Pitiful!I'll take this space to HIGHLY recommend JUstice League Unlimited, Season 1. A GREAT surprise, indeed!Enjoy!"
2,disappointed,"After watching the two Avengers animated movies this one fell flat. The Tony Stark in this movie did not have much personality, and the story was slow. I wish I could give it a better rating, because I love the fact that Marvel and Lions Gate are putting out these animated films, but I recommend saving your money."
3,"A lot to look at, but...","This movie is great to watch because I've never seen a good representation of Iron Man on film, but overall, the story was so-so. I think that more depth could be achieved, but what to you want for an animated feature like this? I don't know. It was okay, and I enjoyed seeing the character. For a better time, my suggestion is to check out ""Avengers"" and the sequel, also on video."
4,Thought it was great.,I thought this was a great movie. I actually thought that this was the better of all the recent animated features from marvel that I know own. The art was great and so was the storyline. I think the negative reviews that I have read from this movie are just that some people are never satisfied. Yes they did change some things about his origin but so what. It shows that Tony/Iron Man is just a very intelligent man in a suit. He is a knight for all this movies shows. I think marvel has a great thing goin with these animated series. I myself have found some of the movies a bit disappointing and with these features you get a better chance at nailing the animated series. Hey marvel I hope you guys work on some Xmen ones soon. You guys need to make up for Xmen 3. lol.
3,The Traditional Iron Man,"After reviewing the Invincible Iron Man, I found that the writers had left the story pretty much the same as the original Iron Man. There were changes made that were updated to a more 21st century version and Marc Worden stuck to the same story of ""ol' shell head"" when I was a boy. Iron Man's armor was different then (red and gold) along with the golden make-shift suit he has in his armor room. Of course, I did not understand why Tony S needed his armor to keep him alive then either. In this present updated version, I found out why. Iron Man back then was was a bodyguard for Stark Enterprises whereas the movie, Tony Stark was befallen by an accident and is in origin. The story is very much like I remembered it, with the exceptional feature of the armor room. The extras in the movie/dvd are really good too. They will assist you in understanding Tony Stark as Iron Man."
1,HORENDOUS!!!!!!,"This was appalling. I actually watched the whole thing, hoping it might get any better. Being a die-hard Iron Man fan, there are too many flaws to list. Not even remotely close to the true story. What were they thinking?!?! Do not buy, rent, borrow, or glance at this movie!!!"
1,Another terribe Marvel animated movie,"The animation on this movie was so bad. It's as bad as the Avenger movies. Terrible animation. The animation reminds me of Gi-Joe cartoons from the 80's.The only good animated scenes are the scenes the elementals, but that's not enough to make it worthwhile.Plus we don't even get to see IronMan in his suit at all the first hour.The movie is just terrible."
1,IRONSCAM!,"I GREW UP READING MARVEL COMICS AND ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TO THE NEXT ISSUE. WHERE IS THE TALENT THESE DAYS? MARVEL HAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY WITH THESE NEW ANIMATED FEATURES TO BE TOP DOG SO, WHY PICK A NON USA PRODUCTION TEAM TO BURY THE FRANCHISE? THIS DVD IS PURE NONSENSE HOWEVER, THE CREATORS OF THIS PRESENTATION ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES AND I GUESS THESE DAYS THATS ALL THAT COUNTS. IRON MAN FANS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WAIT FOR THE RE-ISSUE OF THE 1966 MARVEL SUPER HERO CLASSICS."
5,Iron Man Animated Film,"I really enjoyed this film. I thought it told the story rather well. The animation used CGI for a few parts, mainly covering the suits. Tony is a bit of a jerk at the beginning, but he comes around. I thought it had a good ending."
3,Ehh...,"I bought this to watch with my 9 year old over the Christmas break. The plot was hit and miss. Found myself having to explain the plot every 10 minutes because the plot had no real meat to it. The graphics were ok. For the price, it's tough to complain. Had I paid more I would have taken away yet another star. I would keep looking for a different Iron Man plot and bypass this mind numbing one."
1,The Invincible Ironman,"I was really excited about this DVD, to my knowledge no one had ever done anything like this before, an animated movie about Ironman (COOL!!!). I wish my expectations met what I received. The story is weak, the animation is thin and the voice acting is poor. How could so much time have gone into something so cold, this left me feeling nothing for the characters or the storyline. I really hope more time goes into the live action version because this animated movie does not work on any level."
2,Broken Promise,"Long on story short on action. The other two Avengers movies were put together so well, that it makes for this movie to be a let down."
3,Wasn't that good,I was disappointed by this film. It starts out great but devolves into a robot bash rock-em/sock-em. The story line is both confusing and not memorable. I watched the movie and cannot remember nothing about it at all. It's really not that good of a film. It could've been much better.I would not recommend it to anyone but hardcore Ironman fans
3,My review,"The whole Iron Man storyline had to be explained within a short time frame. Even so, the movie was better then average. The background artwork was great but the character artwork was less then average. It has bonus features that were a plus."
2,Eminently disappointing,"As a Marvel connoisseur, I tried to enjoy this film, but too many liberties were taken with the origin story for the sake of ""updating"" it and too many random changes were made (such as reducing the Mandarin's 10 rings to 5 and changing the appearance and size of the original gray armor). I agree with the reviewer who found similar flaws in the Fantastic Four film; it is sad that Marvel allows so many random, gratuitous changes to be made to its characters and their histories."
2,What's up with Tony Stark's voice?,"This was a boring movie. They needlessly ruined the Mandarin and turned him into some kind of ghost,and for what?The worst part of the movie was the voice characterization of Tony Stark.His breathy ""I'm a sexy ladies man"" was the most ruinous thing I've ever heard. Every time Stark opened his mouth, I expected him to start acting like Quagmire from The Family Guy.Giggidy,giggidy,goo."
5,Very pleased with the movie,"I've been collecting comics since the early 70's. Iron Man was one of my top 3 along with Hulk and Ghost Rider. Story is great, audio and video quality is great. My wife is not even a comic fan and wouldn't let me pause it for more than a minute because she was enjoying it so much.Highly recommended for kids and adults."
1,Terrible Movie: Avoid,"This is one of the absolute worst things I have even had the unfortunate experience of sitting through. With the plethora of high quality animation coming out of Warner Brothers for their DC line, I decided to give some of Marvel's stock a crack. I found this movie on Ebay for 99 cents (seriously, thats all I paid.) and I still feel as though I was ripped off. The earlier reviews give a good overall gist of this terrible plot so there is no point in me rehashing. All I can say is Marvel is extremely lucky the Motion Pictures turned out so well."
4,"Hey, I liked it...","I read many really bad reviews about this one, so I was prepared for the worst. I thought it was pretty darn good though. Yes, I prefer DC's animation over Marvel's, but this is quality animation. It is clearly its own style. I look forward to the next installment."
1,The Invincible Iron Man Blu Ray,"What a waste of blu ray space. The story itself is garbage, it's so boring i was falling asleep and i Do NOT fall asleep when i watch my movies. Animation is drawn well but that is no excuse for how boring it is."
1,Waste of Time,It was boring and lacked most of the elements you would expect in a comic superhero. Nothing positive for promoting a Ironman franchise. Marvel should have killed this project.
4,Ironclad fun..,"This ""reinvented"" Iron Man tale has many of the exciting aspects of theIron Man mythos without the corny or outmoded terms of the sixty's storytelling style.I just wish the Mandarin appeared sooner in this part cel animation,part c.g.i. production."
1,Poor Attempt for an Iron Man animated movie,"This movie was an overall dissapointment considering the hype it got from Marvel. Iron Man's origins were no where close to his Marvel comic origin. The dialogue was downright cheesy as well as annoying...and not to mention the stereotypical characters! The worst part was that the plot line was so obvious it bore me to death. I am so glad I rented this movie, otherwise I would have bought it. Do yourself a favor and save $15 to get yourself something else."
5,Iron Man is Awesome,"I don't agree with some of the other revewers on this one. this movie rocked I can't wait to see the live action Iron Man movie coming out next year. So far most of the marvel movies stuck true to the comic books, Except the Hulk i can't understand why Stan Lee let Ang Lee screw that movie up big time, Ho well Mabey The Incedeble Hulk will be Better. All in All Iron Man rules!"
4,Iron Man rocks,"I don't know why some folks thought this film was 'poor'.It's a cartoon, gee whizz. Even the brief 'woman in the tub' snit, she was covered at all times, steam, towel, behind glass, not like there was any nudity for 'kids' to see.The animation is awesome, they blended CGI and 2-D animation very well.The Engineer was o.k.,I mean, I didn't see much fault. He does honestly point out to Tony some bad char traits of his. Some STARK board members were total creeps, but hey, thats Corperate America.We do see Tony change into a more thoughtful person after his accident. There's only so much char developement you can do in one show.The action was great and movie had a twist at the end.As to the 'original Armour being used a lot', this movie IS an ORIGIN story. You get to see Tony use various models as well. I like this DVD and am very happy to own it. I hope MARVEL makes another!"
2,"As much as I like Iron Man, I was...","disappointed. The animation is good, but the story and dialogue were weak.The ending was what REALLY ruined it for me. The entire Mandarin sub-plot was confusing, LONG and boring. I actually couldn't wait for the movie to be over (so I could pop in my Pink Panter cartoon DVD)...but since I'm a 35 year fan of Iron Man, I rode out the storm. The writers were trying to make some kind of french cuisine with the story, when all i really wanted was meat and potatoes (if you get my drift). There was a shortage of dialogue in the last battle sequence.What a shame for fans of the franchise."
3,"Yes, finally on DVD but what a transfer ...!","Priceless masterpiece but unwatchable on my 16:9 TV because it was encoded in 4:3 aspect ratio. Of course I could zoom the picture to fill the screen but lost the subtitles (I don't speak Russian). Ultimately I had to reencode the movie in 16:9, adding ripped subtitles.But that's not all. The DVD is 29.97 fps (video) and not 23.976 (film), as if encoded from S-VHS (picture quality is good-old-VHS like). So if your DVD player or display's deinterlacing is sub-par you get bonus picture artifacts.I also bought the also priceless Hamlet of Kosintzev from the same publishers and has the same problems (but with burnt-in subtitles).Well, in the end it's better than nothing ..."
1,It's the Russian Film,"T'would be nice it were the Peter Brook film, which I remember liking quite a bit (cinematography by Sven Nyquist if I recall correctly). But in any case, if you enlarge the image here, the film being offered is ""Grigori Kozintsev's King Lear"", which, given Facets' propensity for issuing, shall we say ""second tier"" E. European film, could be something good or something utterly sleep inducing."
3,Not as pictured,"The wallplates I received do not have the humidity indicator that is pictured. They do show the temperature, but I am not sure I would have ordered them if I realized they did not tell the humidity also. The written description of the product is correct, however, I feel it should be correctly represented in the picture as well."
4,space rock,this is the second last album they put out which is good to fair. go back in time guys and make some real music again. captain nemo.
3,The last real Amon Duul II album ?,"Ok so Amon Duul II reformed a few years back but I consider this the last real Amon Duul II album .Just about anything released after this album is god awful and not worth your money .You can tell the band is bored and falling apart by the time this album hit the shelves .It's a run of the mill pop rock album but you can still here the Psychedelic Kraut rock coming through in places especially on the last half of the album .It's easy listening Duul before they got really bad.Other Classic Amon Duul II albums to consider are Yeti,Live in London,Tanz Der Lemmings , Vive le Trance,Carnival of Babylon or Wolf City all classic albums and must haves for your collection."
3,satisfied,I liked this product. But you cant balance just one guitar on the stand at a time.This can be a problem.
2,very cheap,My guitars have fallen off a couple times. The Neck part is sturdy. But the bottom wont stay on.... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR :)
5,Great Purchase,Great double guitar stand! I placed both my Yamaha APX-500 acustic electric and my Fender stratocaster. The neck holder and body are pretty strong so your instruments won't fall easily.
3,ghidorah,my grand son was down on his luck starting kindergarden with his mom n dad spliting up this toy made his day
5,Santa will be a hero this year!,Got this for my 5 year old as a Christmas gift. He's an avid Godzilla fan and is absolutely obsessed with the Godzilla franchise. I can't wait to see his face when he sees what ''Santa'' brought him this year. My only complaint is that it's more than just a tad pricey. These figures can normally be found in K-Mart for about $9.99 each.
5,gift,"This was a gift for a friends daughter. I don't know much on the fine details of how it's made or anything like that. I know this little girl is a collector and plays with all her toys she gets from the godzilla series, and from what I hear she loves it."
4,A funny and informative look at employee theft.,"Told in a funny and very personal style, Mr. New expertly examines the greatest threat to small businesses: employee theft. There's no white-washing here! New looks at employees for what they are -- people ready to steal you blind if you don't take precautions. Anyone running a small business -- no -- anyone running any kind of business should read this! It sure got me thinking"
2,I have an issue with the image representing this product,"This would have been the perfect product, but I relied too heavily on the image for size reference, not the actual dimensions listed on the item. It is far narrower than this photo would suggest."
4,"If history repeats itself, this is a history worth studying",The personal essay is worth something only if the author has something to say. Harold Simonson has used the essay in a way that would speak to most of us if we found ourselves able to take the time to listen. How has the northwest become what it is? How does the life of the father affect that of the son? What does it matter what the old farts think or do? Why should we care? No book has ever moved me more than this one.
5,Sapolsky - Darwin Updated,Robert Sapolsky does not disappoint with this series of essays. He instructs and leaves you with a greater understanding of our own condition. Plenty of Baboon stories as well.This is the fourth Sapolsky book I've read. All are great.
4,Science made fun!,"I was assigned to read this book for a physical anthropology class and I enjoyed it a lot. Sapolsky writes in the style of Stephan Jay Gould, connecting scientific abstracts to everyday life. I enjoyed reading it as it was rather lite material, but in some sense that was a problem with the text. Each chapter had one central point, and then a lot of extraneous words. So overall an interesting read, but not the best ""popular"" science I have ever read."
3,For this review I was called a retard. So no need to read further,"Even the extended title is false marketing. The book contains around 20 short essays on how biology influences our behavior. Only one of the essays deals with testosterone.The acerbic essays are actually quite interesting to read. Sometimes the author is really too full of himself, but that is more an issue of style. The content of the essays are a little bit over the place so do not expect systematic knowledge. What you get is interesting nuggets of knowledge, for instance how testosterone does not make you more aggressive.Book is worth three stars, but I deduct one stars for picking such a misleading title."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"While I bought this book expecting an ""engaging and erudite"" insight into the biological causes behind human behavior, I ended up getting one scientist's narrow perspective. Although the concept of the book is promising, its goals would perhaps be better served in a multi-author collection of essays. This book, written by a researcher of primate stress and its effects on their behavior, might be better titled ""What Baboons do in their Spare Time and Some Obscure Connections to Humans""."
3,It works but doesn't hold much,"Unless you are actually at the stage of your baby/toddler self feeding, it's not really good to spoon feed your baby.I find that the spoon is very flat, so there isn't enough room to hold food to put into my daughter's mouth to eat. The best use I get out of it is a distraction so that she has something to hold on to while I'm feeding her. Until she learns to self feed, she won't be using these utensils. Pretty expensive toy to use if it's only used as a distraction."
1,I'm really sad that I didn't like this book,"I have enormous respect for Merrill Markoe, and I expected to love her book. Unfortunately, I couldn't get past the first few chapters. This was a great idea, but the humor and wit I anticipated simply weren't there. Please try again Merrill!"
2,Misses the Mark,I bought this book thinking that the author had some respectable comedy chops. Sadly this book is just not that funny and as this was my primary reason for purchase I was disappointed.I read it to the end but it just didnt go anywhere and was a largely pointless excercise. The mysterious flower delivery was obvious from the beginning and the relationship with the parents barely comprehensible. This is NOT Bridget Jones and has none of its charm and wit.
5,hilarious!!!,"This is the funniest book I've read in a long time. I went in not expecting much, and I ended up laughing so hard, I had tears in my eyes. For anyone who has ever experienced embarrasment at the hands of your parents-you'll appreciate this. For anyone who needs a good laugh, this book is a great choice."
1,Bitter Birthdays,"I got this book not so surprizingly on my birthday. At first I thought the title was funny and the back excerpt seemed hilarious. But the actual book was not so funny. Typical of may thirtysomething single woman books, it focus on the narrator's lack of a positive love interest. True there were some really funny moments, but mostly I sensed a depressing undercurrent. The totally horrible relationship with her parents and obsessing over a past breakup became tiring. I was also a bit bothered with the narrator's ""detective"" work, it bordered on weird.There were some lessons to be learned. Don't take the bait with people that want to pick a fight with you and try to learn something new each year.However, this thiry something single lady is glad...no overjoyed that I find much more happiness in my life that the narrator managed to squeeze out of hers!"
2,OVERRATED in my opinion,"After reading all the rave reviews on this book I couldn't wait to read it! Unfotunately it didn't live up to all the hype.The premise of this book, as you probably know by now is a high school art teacher who writes to herself on her Birthday (beginning with #36) reflecting on the past year, what she learned and what she hoped to accomplish the following year.The premise of this book is both unique and original. Unfortunately the content was so dark and depressing that it just wasn't fun to read. I kept hoping that the something/anything good would happen to the character, just one year, but noooo...each year was just more and more depressing then the next.Don't get me wrong, I realize that life's ""downs"" were what made the book funny (in parts) but couldn't she have had something/anything GOOD happen one year???"
1,Not what it seems,I definately bought this book because of the title. Expecting this to be a funny/touching novel was my mistake. The funny moments are few and Markoe's relationship with her parents just becomes uncomfortable. She never really examines the dysfuntion...she just relays the brutal events of each birthday visit. But the breaking point had to be when I figured out the mystery of the flowers in the FIRST CHAPTER. This woman is clueless! I could NOT relate!
1,What a rip off!,"With such a great title, I expected this to be an excellent read--it was quite the opposite. Dull and repetitive. I finished the book, however I don't recommend it."
2,Not As Funny As I Thought It Would Be,"Too much bitter info. about the character's parents. If they are so awful why doesn't this grown woman grow up and spend less time with mom and dad? The flowers from the former flame that she receives each year for her birthday is so lame and contrived that it has to be true. Some laughs, but mostly sad stuff because the character and the author both seem stuck in the past."
3,Good way to spend a weekend,"What a quick read! This book is witty and light. The main character, whose name remains a mystery, has the worst relationship with her parents and even more unlucky romantic relationships. Her hijinx, though brief, are comical. This story isn't going to change your life, but it is a nice way to spend a weekend.**Disclaimer** This review comes from a person about 10 years too young to relate to the main character, so it's entirely possible that I would have gotten more out of the book if I was 10 years older."
3,Mildly amusing,"I know Markoe has great credentials, but having already seen ""Sex and the City"" through all 6 seaons, and ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" there's not much new here. I haven't finished it yet, about half way through. The opening chapter describing her horrific parents is pretty fun, but I just can't quite get a feel for main character or the people in her life. But it's a mildly entertaining read, especially for any woman who's had to endure being single in her 30's."
3,A So-So Read,"""It's My F---ing Birthday"" is a light read and is a pretty decent book. There were some funny moments, and I was so happy to read that she has a ""dumb girl"" too.I do, however, have a few complaints about this book: the main one is her parents! Both of her parents are way too neurotic and made me so mad! Maybe I'm the weird one because i have a good relationship with my parents. I can't believe her mom and dad would act like that to their daughter (especially on her birthday) and that she would just sit and take it. The other complaint is that i don't really think she learned her lesson at the end. She says that she has finally figured things out, but that is what she says every year!I thought that the concept of the book was very original, and if you can get past her crazy parents, it's not too bad of a read."
2,"Good start...then, eh","I anticipated a sly, witty look at the world of a single woman over 35, which this started out to be. But I became really disturbed by the dysfunction surrounding the character's relationship with her parents, and the way she embraced being the victim, or fall-guy. There is nothing sly or witty about a 30-something woman who can't walk away when mean, hurtful words are the inevitable outcome of a family gathering, or can't ask a straight forward question to get to the bottom of a nagging question. I wanted to see her stand up for herself, instead of chronicling another failed year."
1,Lazy Writing,"Someone below says they read it in one night. That's because Markoe wrote it in one night. With her eyes closed. Talented, funny writer that she is, she must have looked at Helen Fielding's success and thought, ""Hey, I can do that . . ."" Maybe she can, but she doesn't pull it off here. Buy her essays instead."
1,bland,I really thought this novel had promise. The author writes for David Letterman no less. It proved monotaneous and not funny. ... Save your money.
2,I was misled!,"The title is funny. The premise is funny. The book itself is not funny. I only laughed at her comment about Hillary Clinton at the end of the book. In the beginning of the book the issues with her parents were moderately interesting, but were just repeated with no originality added throughout the book. In the dearth of chick books that have been published since the success of Bridget Jones' Diary, the only thing that stands out about this one is the title."
1,Waste of Paper and Money,"If this woman never worked for David Letterman, I doubt this book would have ever been published. It was a waste of my time and totally annoying. I will argue that this is not even a novel but a poorly written compilation of personal essays written by a clueless, emotional woman looking to make a buck.Do not waste your time or money reading this ""novel."""
3,"Not really a ""feel good"" book","This book started off with me thinking it was hilarious and I was laughing so hard I was almost crying. But after the narrator's first birthday was over her bitterness towards her parents got to be not so funny. I often wondered, why does she not just stop spending her birthday with them? They were awful people who treated her very badly for the most part. I read the whole book but I was not laughing anymore by the end."
1,Tedious,"This book is written in a clever style. But it boils down to only two things - the gifts of idiotic clothing to the main character on her birthday every year, and the bouquet of flowers from an ex-boyfriend, also every year on her birthday. This got to be tedious after the first birthday. The main character, who apparently has no name, was so weak and spineless I felt like kicking her in the you-know-where. I would have told the parents and the ex to go to you-know-where. Why the author thought the same old-same old for 7 years would be interesting to read about is beyond me."
2,"Funny moments, tempered by depressing storyline","I had high hopes for this book after reading a few glowing reviews, but I ultimately came away disappointed. The book starts out promising, and Markoe's writing is breezy, funny, and occasionally clever. Midway through, however, the incessantly bleak existence of the main character wears you down, and the writing becomes heavy-handed and over-the-top. The character becomes less and less sympathetic, because she does not mature or learn anything with each passing year, and continues to make the same relationship mistakes over and over again. There are those that would argue that this is a lot like real life, but one would think that a book would have a higher purpose to entertain. Unfortunately, there's nothing entertaining about this sad, lonely, mixed-up woman with low self-esteem who spends an inordinate amount of time obsessing over minute relationship details, and expects us to care."
2,Humorous,The book read quickly and the author is gifted at humor.The insights into the main character's life were interesting and entertaining.The book was lacking in solid content.
2,not the greatest ever,this book is very hard to get in to. once you read a few chapters it still doesnt really pull you in. it is sort of depressing as well. if you enjoy reading books about people who are sad and lonely this is the book for you. other wise i would skip it!
4,quick read,I enjoyed reading this book-I love the Haardrad family and how they took care of each other through thick and thin. I loved Selig's character and how the author portrayed him as this uber handsome Viking.
5,Perfect,"I do not believe there is a Johanna Lindsey book out there that I would ever give less than a five star rating. Johanna introduced me to romance, being the first author I read as a teenager and continue to read to this day. She has a way of writing that is smart, sassy, engaging, erotic, humorous and intelligent ... all at the same time. If you've never read a Johanna Lindsey book, shame on you and start NOW."
4,surrender my love,This book is a typical Lindsey which is not a bad thing. She has a way of bringing these characters to life and it makes you wish you knew a Garrick or a Selig. I hate when her books have to end. If you want a fast read this is it
4,alright,i thought the book was alright. better than some of the newer j.l. books. this one didn't dwell and dwell and dwell on the fighting/argument between the two main characters. (you know the kind that makes some small part of you hate the main characters just a little bit)!
3,Not one of her best...but still good,"The first two books of this trilogy are wonderful. I've read them several times since getting them. I always wanted to hear Selig's story, and feel it probably should have been told before Kristen's. This book seems to center around dialogues between Selig, Kristen, and Brenna, instead of focusing on the relationship between Selig and Erika. I don't like weak female characters, but not all women are strong so it makes since that not all characters will be. Of course, Erika started out that way and then seemed to sort of die in her enthusiasm to be free of Selig. Though it's not one of the best stories Ms. Lindsey has told, it's not as bad as Captive Bride. I would recommend this book, though it does seem a little chopped up in places. If you can get passed Kristen's temper, it's a good read."
3,Where has the passion gone to?!,"This is the book about Selig The Bless, son of Garrick and Brenna from ""Fires of Winter"" and brother of Kristen from ""Hearts Aflame"".The storyline of this book is similiar to those of the previous two books that I have mentioned above. Selig was captured by Lady Erika's men when he was wrongy accused of being a spy. He was treated with cruelty that he vowed revenge to the lady. When Selig was saved by his sister, Kristen, he wanted to bring Erika back with him, not as a lady but as a slave, to repay what she had done to him.I feel that this story has lack of chemistry and passion between Selig and Erika. There was even a lack of trust between the two parties. I didn't see love blossom between the two as in the other two books. I must say that the previous two books are superb! ""Surrender My Love"" is a story that can be told in fewer pages than the full 403 pages.Quite disappointing..."
2,Not What I Expected,I could not wait to read Selig's story but what a disappointment it was. The book was more of a family reunion than a story about Selig and Erika. Although I enjoyed hearing about the rest of the family his story did not stand alone. I thought a couple of chapters could have been eliminated. The first two books in the Viking series I highly recommend they are excellent reads. Find this one at your local library.
2,Slow and Plodding,"I was given this book at the beach by my friend and had not read the previous two. In fact didn't know there even were other stories until a few chapters into this one. Maybe if I'd read the previous two I would've cared more about Selig and Erika.However, if you are a big J.L. fan make sure you read the previous two before this one. If you don't you may find it as I did. Sloooooooowwwww and a bit dull. I didn't care for either of the characters and although all romance fans are guarunteed a happy ending Selig and Erika's personalities made their actions and motivations in the book so foregone that it was a trial to finish it out.Seems like Selig was a bit of a fan fav. for this trilogy and it's a shame that more wasn't made of his story."
3,The Third in a Trilology,"This is the final book in the Viking Haardrad clan saga. The other books are better, and this is the weakest of the three. Yet, it is a delight to read about the characters from the previous books as their lives progress. The heroine in this book, Erika, is a Dane, and is weakly drawn. The dashing eldest son of Lady Breena and Garrick from book one, Selig, is disappointing. Other than his supposed good looks, he seems capable of real cruelty. Yet, reading the other books first, one understands the genesis of it, that this is expected behavior of Vikings and part of his heritage, resembling his grandfather and father. This is not a bad book, but it is not brillant either and lacks her exciting plotlines and excellent character development. But even when Ms. Lindey is not up to 5 stars, her books are worth reading."
3,Good Read...but just once,"I have not read the first two books from the trilogy, but I hear they're wonderful and I have the feeling I should have gotten them instead of bothering with this book. Its incredibly underdeveloped concerning plot. Selig did not seem quite angry enough over Erika's involvement in his horrible ordeal, Kristen was nasty and mean as hell the entire time, and Erika...well, I just didn't get her. The ending was kind of creative, though."
5,Not disappointed,Funny and sweet at the same time.I really do love Johanna Lindsey's books. The Haardrad Family is one of my favorites from Lindsey.
2,Blah,"The second book was definitely the best one in the trilogy. I think that Lindsey should have taken her time w/this--Selig deserved better. The heroine was so weak and passive--not to mention totally unlikable. Ulg, don't read this book; better to reread a favorite or something."
1,Borrow it from a friend or the library,"I would definitely recommend borrowing this book over buying it. The plot never got fully developed. After reading Hearts Aflame, I was looking forward to reading about Selig. In this novel, he appears as a mere shadow of himself. He and Erika are very shallow characters the likes of which are usually in the background of a novel. Even his nickname is corny and not fully thought out. This is another of those novels when the hero and heroine fall in love and you have to ask yourself why. They know nothing about one another. For that matter, we as the reader don't know enough about them to care either."
3,Surrender,"Surrender My Love was the very first Johanna Lindsey novel and the very first romance that I read. After I read it, I was completely hooked. I absolutely loved this story, and if I would have reviewed this story right after I read it I probably would have given it 5 stars, but since then I have read many of her novels as well as other romance novels by other authors and I have found that this one is a little bit lacking. It doesn't have very many romance scenes which I believe is key to a romance novel, but the story is an interesting one, its pretty suspenseful and the characters are very likable. I do recommend this novel just based on the story line, but not for the romance."
5,Excellent,This was a great buy it allows me more room I don't have to sit close to the tv when it's charging a great buy.
1,Does not function,"I purchased this cable (total of 4, one for me and a few for others who are in country), had it brought to me because I live in Chile. Wouldn't function. Check the cable with my meter, and there are opens. In other words, it was broken when it was received. So were all the others that were purchased. Due to living in Chile, I cant return it nor can I get a new one. I must make this very clear, do not buy this cable. 4 out of 4 were bad, that's not a great average."
1,wouldn't charge,this product wouldn't charge my controller and only worked when it was plugged into my ps3. I like the convinience it provided but the poing of a wireless controller is suppose to work without it plugged in all the time
1,Very disappointed,I ordered this and it arrived in a very timely fashion. It charged my controller perfectly fine once. After that it would not charge at all. It was a waste of money. Do not buy.
4,Awsome,This items work great and is longer than the original cable. I will recommned this item to all of my friends.
3,Not really a game...,"Some of these reviews need a little work, the accessory works well, good enough to plug into the controler of the PS3 and keep the controler's charged. Works good, in great condition, good stuff, plus these type of charging cables often go along with other sony products as well. Thannks for reading and have a nice day."
3,Cable durability,After a couple of weeks in use the cable began shorting. The otherwise the cable was everything I expected. Its is a great product for it's price
3,Good Details,"This master work is very rich in detail and, as such, makes a great referrence guide. However, Gibbon's prejudice against Byzantium and the bad press he gave it deter young people from learning about it even today. That being the case, it could be argued that even it might have been better had these tomes never been written. They certainly would have been much better had he kept his personal animosities to himself."
5,The Master Stylist,"The subject was worthy of the man. One of the three or four greatest works of English prose. I am twenty-three, and have just now finished reading the Decline and Fall for the second time. Perhaps that will give you an idea of its greatness. The Latinate vocabulary is perfectly suited to its subject; Gibbon's irony is always brilliant, often funny; what else is there to say? Avoid abridgements, get the complete work, and lave yourself in the neoclassical splendors."
2,Kindle ed: Footnote numbers missing (in the text),"I ordered a sample for Vol-1. Although, the footnotes are present but the corresponding numbering (within the text) is missing.For, example in chapter-1 (The Extent and Military Force of the Empire in the Age of the Antonines), teh first footnote reads ""1.Dion Cassius"". But the corresponding numbering (in this case, 1) is missing from the text (end of para 2 ""..defeat of Crassus"")I had to wait pretty long on a Amazon customer chat session, to get this point across the concerned dept.I hope the publishers, would take a note of it and try and rectify the prob asap !Also, it seems volume 2 is still not available (Vol 3 is). Don't know how useful will it be to purchase Vol 1 and then skip straightway to Vol 3 !"
5,Excellent,It was exactly wat I was wanting to purchase and I am mor√© than glad with the result. Everything has arrive in perfect condition and incredibly fast.
1,Cheap JUNK!!!!!!,"I had this less than 2 weeks, accidentally dropped it in the shower and the portion of the handle above the rubber grip broke off! I'll be investing in a more expensive wooden one next. This is a cheap piece of junk. Do NOT waste your money."
4,"Very Nice, Excellent value","I also ordered these to get away from the problems with the wooden brushes. It's an excellent value and a very nice brush. Long handle like it's wooden counterpart, gives plenty of reach. Nylon bristels are just right, might be too stiff for a woman. The nylon doesn't lather as well as a natural bristle either, but will certainly last a lot longer. If I ever have to replace it ... I'd definitly get the Feng Shui again. Recommended"
4,"Gee, my brushes have lasted for almost a year","I am surprised that the other reviewers have had such problems with their back brushes. Our family has both the green and the blue brushes (his and hers), and they've lasted almost a year. The brushes are hung on hooks inside the tub area when not in use, and the tub is an acrylic surround over an iron clawfoot tub. Perhaps it's the acrylic surround that's making the difference, because it's not because I've never dropped the thing.I gave the brush four stars, because the bristles on mine are a skeevy yellow color that it picked up from some lemon body wash. I thought that the plastic bristles were fairly impermiable to such things. Otherwise, this back brush does everything I want a back brush to do."
5,Catherine cookson has done it again!,"Catherine cookson has written another delightful novel that travels through the generations of one family. The curse of the Mallen Streak is filled with tragedy and forbidden love, it takes you right to the heart of lifes trials and tribulations with all of its wanting to be accepted in a time when scandal was everything and could not be forgiven. I highly recommend this novel whether you are a Catherine Cookson fan or not!"
5,Captivating,Wonderful beginning to a trilogy. I can't wait to read more. Just as enthralling as the other Catherine Cookson novels I have read.
4,great!,"This is a great little book - quite a few pattern, various designs - snowflakes, an angel, butterflies, little doiles, and a 3-D umbrella! Great for a shower, or if you have Travelers insurance. (use black thread)Small section on Cluny tatting - and it's all you need - i'm a beginner and i learned cluny just fine from it! I think there are basic tatting instructions, but i learns from Linden's Easy tatting, so I breezed by them.Great book for the price!"
5,A good one for the tatting library,"This book has some great basic patterns. It's always a good standard to go back to when I need a quick pattern for something. The patterns are written long-hand, but are fairly easy to follow. The majority of the patterns are easy enough for beginner to intermediate tatters. Advanced tatters can modify the patterns to eliminate some cutting and tying. Overall a very good book."
3,not really my kind of book :-(,"This is the first tating bok I ever bought, and I have been quite disappointed with the patterns.There's some angles and some snowflakes, but a lot of the patterns are ""one shuttle"" works and I just can't make those look right because I can somehow never get the ""bits of thread between rings"" to be the same length.However the book has some very interesting patterns in it, like a 3d butterfly which I really want to make but since I have no clue of the english crocheting terms and those would be necessary to finish the butterfly I'm a little stuck *g*Anyway. if you're able to do ""one shuttle work"" really well and like stars and collars (3 of those in the book) this book might be just the thing for you :-)"
3,Good Christmas Patterns,"This booklet offers nice Christmas patterns, my only dislike and reason why I only gave 3 stars is the way the instructions are presented. They are crammed as text and very difficult to follow if not rewritten and reorganized for clear view. Other than that, I enjoyed shuttle tatting for Christmas projects."
3,Not As Advertised ...,"i purchased this item via ""Pre-Order"" to continue my collection when it was still being advertised as ""With T-Shirt."" that's what was on my order confirmation, and that's what was on the shipping confirmation. what arrived instead was a version of the product with the cheesy ""collector card"" other reviewers have mentioned.i note that the product is currently correctly identified, but if you're expecting a T-Shirt based on the article description from, say, a link saved in your wish list, you will be disappointed.i note that the price was -not- adjusted along with the table of contents..."
3,The good and the lies,Ok bought this right as the store opened today. The regular one was $16 this one was $30. There is no T-shirt in the deluxe edition one. For double the price all you get is a plastic keycard with the majors picture on it. I love the series but Bandai really pulled some tricks with this one grrrr.
1,waste of money,I got it and it would barely even spray. Dont waste your money. I didnt notice the difference when I put it on my tires.
2,It may not work that well but at least it's expensive.....Hi,"High hopes, expectations and price....poor spray pattern....much more time consuming than similar cheaper products....shine and durability mediocre....please save yourself time, money and frustration.....buy another brand...."
2,"Shine is moderate. Doesn't last long, and stains my driveway.","This tire shine gives the shine that I want (minimal, not really shiny just a bit of gloss) but does not last more than 5 days or so. Unfortunately, after 2 uses the can no longer works - it makes noise but nothing comes out, unless you turn and hold the can upside down the whole time you are spraying. It also stains my driveway with crescent moon shaped swoosh-marks where I spray the bottom half of the tire wall!Final note, it arrived with a broken cap, and I believe the cap was broken prior to shipment because it appeared the only way it fit in the shipping box was because the cap was squished."
5,Whacky and entertaining mysteries,"We love New Tricks. The mysteries are good, but it it the interaction and actions of the three retired policemen brought back to solve unsolved crimes that is like the three stooges. Jack has conversations with his dead wife enshrined in his back yard, Gerry, the lad, with many ex-wives has an eye for the women, and Brian the near bipolar with a total recall memory. Sandra, the chief inspector, tries to rein in this zany bunch. They solve crimes in many unorthodox ways, which they can get away with as they are not really cops. The acting is supurb. They can do as much with a glance as with a paragraph of script. WE order these as fast as they are available. Series Six will be available in January. May may not have noticed that Jerry Waterman also sings the theme song as he did in previous series that he starred in. This is not a mystery series in the vain of Midsommer Murders or Frost or Lewis, but for pure entertainment it is one of the best."
3,Cristian Castro's first,"For a debut, is quite good, but compared to later albums, it shows that he wasn't prepared completely, too many tone variations, and also you may notice some differences in the quality of recording between songs. For fans a must buy, for others you may pass it up."
3,Buy this only if you cant live with out NO PODRAS,"The CD has easily about 4 very good songs, but its True, Cristians voice on this CD isnt very good (he was only 17). But if your a Cristian fan now you should buy this CD if only to appreciate how much Cristians voice has improved. Few artists can say that they have consistently improved thier voice with each new CD as Cristian can."
1,I refuse to believe that this is even Cristian singing!,"It doesn't sound anything like him. The vocals are awful, and do not sound anything like Cristian's voice which is fantastic on his CD's Mi Vida Sin Tu Amor and Lo Mejor De Mi. So I don't know what the deal is here. I think they had another singer actually do the tracks on this CD, and then put Cristian's face on the cover of the CD, unless Cristian got some SERIOUS singing lessons in the span of one year (this CD was in 1997 and Lo Mejor De Mi was in 1998 and is EXQUISITE). This is bad bad bad."
3,Wrong title,The intentions were never good. It is being revealed by the results.Liked an interview of the author in The Kathmandu Post though.Rate the book I must.
4,Homestead was the Balls...,"I saw this record in a horrible galleria mall record store in 1987 and liked the title, so I picked it up. For the first time I heard Dinosaur Jr, Big Black, Naked Raygun, and the astonishing Squirrel Bait. ""Valley of the Gwanji"" by Phantom Tollbooth, and ""Ft. Belvedere"" by Live Skull are also amazing. It was a smorgasbord for a starving lad. An excellent cross section of postpunk in the (L)eighties."
2,So so,"A misguided compilation at best mixing some of the best indie bands of the 80's (Naked Raygun,Squirrel Bait, Big Black,Dinosaur jr) with some of the lamest(Reactions,Big Dipper,Great Plains,Death of Samantha). Antietam, Live Skull and Breaking Circus hold their own but overall this comp misses the mark and I believe Homestead pretty much disavowed it about a year later. Ultimately(sic) there are much better mid-late 80's indie comps out there."
2,"Bad Movie, but Worth it for SRK","I bought this movie simply because it's the only Bollywood movies that has a SRK sex scene, which hereafter, he has promised never to do. I bought it for that reason, since I am a SRK fan and will pretty buy anything with him in it. But other than that, it was poorly made."
5,"Engaging, lively and witty","The topic of this book seems off-putting, for some reason. It seems that we all assume that the history of dueling would be grim, dull and depressing.But on a whim, I checked this book out from the library. Within a day or two, I had placed my order to buy it. It is an intelligent and a very engaging read. Barbara Holland brings her charming wit to every page."
3,"Good, but annoying at times- and terribly formatted for Kindle.","I found this a good read overall but it's about as deep as a puddle. My main problem is the author's tone- most reviewers call it light and satirical, but to me it's often flippant and forced. Maybe a little too much straining to be clever. Still, I only paid $2.99 so I;m not complaining much- I've certainly gotten my money's worth in entertainment and a little education.The Kindle formatting is terrible. Words are frequently run together or split and at one point the font jumps to a very large size for several pages. Chapter XV is titled WIND IN GDOWN - it took me a minute to realize it was WINDING DOWN."
1,None,this is not a good book. she makes crazy generalizations about men to add interest and drama. passes her opinion off as historical fact. feels poorly researched i never review $3.99 books but this was not good
1,Don't waste your money,Dancing in the hype. This book is all fluff - there is not any real truth to grasp. Don't waste your money - or the quick click on amazon will be a regret. And will you really take the time to send it back?
5,Dancing in the Light,"Shirley Maclaine is a remarkable woman, interesting and complex, intelligent and funny. I love all her books including this one."
3,A good effort but needs help.,"If you're looking for a helpful perspective on statistical methodologies related to ""groundwater detection monitoring,"" this book is a good place to start.The book contains much valuable information for properly implementing detection monitoring plans. However, extracting this information requires much effort. The book appears to be multiple publications cobbled together. Thus, consistency between each chapter/section is poor. This, plus some misprints, made the understanding of the subjects presented more time consuming than should have been necessary.I little editing and this material would be of great value to environmental professionals involved with this complex topic."
1,Somebody Shoot Me!,"Because I just listened to this CD and I need to be put out of misery. Self-indulgent, whiny and insipid. I'd rather listen to two cats fight over a dead bird than this CD again."
1,Grotesque sizing!,My husband has big hands. But these are really ridiculous. The fingers overlap at least an inch longer than any normal large hand's fingers would.Don't buy unless they're for someone with a growth disorder!
2,What a disappointment,"I purchased this video, and the companion video, for some ideas for teaching a Back to Health class. If I didn't practice yoga myself, I wouldn't have known what was going on. There is no voiceover on these videos. The instructor just goes through the motions. No talking, no instructing. I was very disappointed."
3,Got this for my sister,"I gave this to my sister. She has a back problem and I was hoping it would help keep her loose and comfortable. She hasn't sent me any overwhelming praise about it, so I guess it's ok so far."
2,Was expecting much more,"I thought this text would provide more detailed analysis of the content, but I found it to be quite over-simplified. My traditional texts did a better job providing the ""short course."" However, for the layman (not a nursing student or nurse), it does provide a good, adequate introduction to med vocabulary."
5,seems nice,"They're kind of small, but they stretch to fit. I have the white color and got mine for free(they must have accidentally placed it in with my order)."
1,The aerobics off the musical beat!,"It is not that the movement are not good movements,it is the fact that they are not in time with the music that makes this dvd really hard to follow. I took it from the library, did it once (it nearly drove me crazy) then returned it. Don't waste your money!"
1,DoubleD review,I agree wholeheartedly with Brother Cadfael's review of this DVD. They do not keep up with their own music; they do not look professional and I was very disappointed with this DVD. I would not recommend this DVD to anybody and it should be recalled.
1,Junk,"The guys from Arcade Fire are too good to gives us a simple live DVD... Their intellect is soooo big that they had to play it ""nouvelle vague""...You're supposed to become cathartic and have a trance watching their ""experiences""... Alas, even the (so good) music seem to be recorded in a litter bin...Hey ! That's an idea ! Give that dvd the place it deserve : the litter bin !!!"
3,Arcade Fire on Austin City Limits,"I too was disappointed, and like others I first learned of Arcade Fire from their brilliant performance on Austin City Limits.I contacted ACL about a possible DVD release, and was told:The Arcade Fire episode is not available for purchase at this time. We encourage you to contact our distribution partner New West Records and let them know you'd like to see the show as part of the Live From Austin TX line. Thanks for writing.[...]I've written New West Records urging the ACL show be released as a DVD; I now urge all of you to also write them (nice, encouraging, etc) notes to the same effect. IF New West Records is convinced that the dvd would sell, then there is hope we might get what we want"
2,Much more to be desired,"Apparently the band has said that this production was true to the band. The band may be satisfied but many viewing this DVD will be unimpressed. Very little connection with the band on viewing, not informative at all, and just isn't interesting most of the time. Some highlights are some clips of live performances from interesting views and the scenes of them in the studio making comments. Other than that, very below average."
4,A great help!,This book is a great help for one interested in learning about biblical exegisis. No teacher should be without it.
1,Carlo Bergonzi DVD concert,"Unfortuneatly,I cannot review the content of this concert as I received 2 flawed DVD discs; neither would play in several new DVD machines; the first disc did not fit properly and appeared warped; the 2nd disc would not load properly and had a malformed edge. I would defintely like to have a working disc as Bergonzi has always been a favorite. The score of one does not reflect the content; just the fact that the discs received would not play."
4,Delightful variety,"Children Go Where I Send Thee: A Christmas Celebration Around the Worldis an aptly subtitled. This collection combines unfamiliar carols from many countries and some interesting arrangements of familiar carols. All are presented with pleasing performances and sound. There are a couple of songs that don't appeal to me, and one piece where the conductor, in my opinion, loses the national flavor (Bethlehemu, Nigeria), though you might like it if you aren't familiar with the performance that I love (very likely, because this is a rare carol). The first song, while it has nothing but ""spirit"" in common with Christmas, is nonetheless delightful.Highly recommended. Good addition to collections filled with the standard Christmas fare."
3,get rehab doll\dry as a bone,"I really like this band, but after listening to the clips, rehab doll\dry as a bone is much better."
2,"Good cast, great production, but weak script and direction","The Walter Matthau version of ""Little Miss Marker"" tries very hard to capture the authentic 1930s Damon Runyon flavor. The art direction is superb, the Henry Mancini score is wonderful, and Matthau is fine as always, but the film promises more than it delivers. The original Runyon story tells of a hard-hearted bookie who reluctantly accepts a little girl as security for a wager, and gradually thaws out as he cares for the child as his own. The story (faithfully told in the 1934 Adolphe Menjou-Shirley Temple film version) strikes all the right notes as the plot progresses, but the 1980 script rambles aimlessly and often overlooks key plot points, with many missed opportunities for the Runyon warmth and humor. Still watchable thanks to Matthau and villain Tony Curtis, but what should have been a sure winner finishes out of the money."
4,"Interesting Movie, But Many Details","This movie goes into so much detail until it takes time to figure out what is going on. I bought it and watched it, but it will be one that I will seldom watch again. Good buy for fans of Walter Matthau or Julie Andrews."
5,Best heartwarming Matthau movie ever,I have always loved this movie and was thrilled to find it available on DVD. Have had the original since it was first released on VHS. It is a fun lovely film
5,"Movie 'Little Miss Marker""",I loved the movie years ago when it came out. It was wonderful to enjoy it again.
1,go away shirley,"If i watch one more film oh Shirley Temple acting ""cute"" and sickly sweet for the camera, i just may lose my lunch. All of her movies depend oh her being ""adorable"" to carry the plot. Well i'm here to say that not all of us find Temple cute sweet or adorable. In fact i actually find it extremely annoying and just down right sick sick sick!"
4,Use your Hand,"Dude is serious about his horoscopes.. a little too serious lol.. no but its a good read, although it has a lot of scientific numbers in it that the average human being will draw a ??. I had to skip almost half the book because of all the useless information.. like I said, this book is for the extremely advanced, and I was very knowledgable on my horoscopes before reading this book. other than that its a good read, opinionated, but I learned a few things."
1,Portray of oriental inferiority,"This is bad translation. It's a 5000 year old book, which gives the details of an ancient civilization, and it has been treated in disgust, as it seems.It was disheartening to see the imperialist views of oriental cultures in the 21st century."
1,Vedas translations are not correct,"Per your comments, i saw that vedas are showing agni,vayu,indra are different gods.... which means its incorrect ... FYI, vedas talk about one god and thats Ishwar, all you read named agni, vayu, indra, shiva, and whatever it is ... its name of one god... Vedic culture is different from current hinduism, the one who follows sanathan dharma still exists and they are called Arya Samaj... Arya Samaj has proved that Vedas translated by Griffith and Muller are incorrect. you can compare and find out yourself ... By the way, Griffith introduced new verses which were not in vedas and if you look at 10th mandal he translated some words to be female organ which is not the right meaning... One has to understand sanskrit to read the authenticity of vedas and find the truth...If the Author of this book is also following the same thing then You are reading completely incorrect picture of Ancient culture."
5,"Classic book, great service","Service was great. Got combined free shipping on it along with two other books, fast and easy service."
4,Thousands and thousands of astonishing images from all times,"The Dover Deskgallery Mega-Bundle is perhaps the most complete trace-art image bank in the world. Optimized for both Windows/MacOS systems, the 15 cds contains everything you can imagine in old-fashioned art prints. The best item in it are the images from 19th century selling catalogues."
1,"Should be called ""How to Start a Drapery Business""","The title is truly misleading. The authors ""Interior Design"" Business is a window covering business. She sells window coverings, flooring and wallcoverings but is apparantly not a designer. Don't expect any in depth advice on working with clients creating integrated room plans, using trade-only showrooms etc. If you want to focus on one aspect of the business, simply selling floor or window coverings, great. But, I feel cheated even though this book was inexpensive"
2,This book suggests an education in design is NOT necessary.,"As a professional interior designer who is now ready to start my own business, I found this book of little use. The author seems to think anyone can become an interior designer just by reading this one book. I strongly disagree."
4,Interesting and Overlooked,"After a string of otherwise-inexplicable disasters (the loss of his wife, his job, and his house), Seth becomes convinced that, for some reason, God is out to get him. Since prayer doesn't help him--on the contrary--Seth decides to break every one of the Ten Commandments. That puts him on a strange path, where he reencounters his sister-in-law, who's stuck in a miserable marriage; and literally faces death. The end is strange, unexpected and quite beautiful."
4,this was a great movie,"since you've read the reviews above, i won't bore you with another one. the basic plot is that Quinn is wondering what God is doing to him. his wife died, his dog can't use one of its legs, and so forth. Quinn starts breaking all the commandments, but along the way he got more than he bargained for. he falls in love with Cox (his wife's sister) and realizes it's hardere to break the commandments than it looks. i think the movie is an excellant heartwarming tale, but the ending is kind of far fetched."
2,"Pretty odd movie, Courteney is what makes it worth seeing.","I have to admitt, I didn't like this movie much at all. It made no sense and it was just messy. Courteney was lovely as the wife but the other characters, especially the two lead-brothers were hard to get what they were all about. So, unless you really like CeCe, I don't recommend this one."
4,Under-rated,"Commandments is an unfairly overlooked movie. It didn't get a lot of promotion, and took a long time to come out on video at a sell-through price.True, the lighter moments don't always sit well alongside the heavier moments, but the movie still holds together fairly well, even managing to make a few points along the way.More importantly, unlike a lot of other movies these days, Commandments emotionally engages the viewer; you actually care what happens to the main characters.Finally, the cinematography is fabulous. The film's visual tone is arguably the central element that holds everything else together - but it does so without overwhelming everything else.Neither light comedy nor heavy drama, Commandments is the kind of movie that will have you wondering why you didn't see it sooner."
4,Not recommended for religious people with no sense of humor,"But still good for the open-minded! I guess I should say you shouldn't see this movie unless you are a big fan of one of the cast members. The characters could have been developed better and the movie could have been longer (it is about an hour and a half). But still, it's a good movie to see if you like dark comedy, and I mean really, really dark. I myself liked it a lot; however, it is pretty strange and the ending could have been much, much better. Harry is a rather static character that you will probably hate, unless you love Anthony LaPaglia, and Sparky the dog is an added bonus. Rent this movie - you may regret it, but you probably won't."
1,Wrong picture wrong price,The picture shown is not the 317-U (go to Destaco.com and see). Also the price is out of sight. Try toggleclamps.biz for great (fabulous) pricing and service.
3,Not for the faint hearted,This is a very good book if you have studied neuroscience. Otherwise it is quite hard going. This is an important source book for facts and research that backs up much of the recent theories on the practical use of the brain. The ability of the brain to 'create itself' and to constantly change is a reletively recent understanding and it is extremely significant in all areas of thinking and personal development. Just don't take it to read on the beach!
5,Turn your thoughts into REALITY!,This book is interesting from a psychological perspective- the author conducted his own experiments proving the capability for subconsciously willed manipulation of brain restructuring.
5,The Mind is a great book with a mix,This book combines research and his own experience and life involvement with mindfulness. The book was informative and helpful. His arguments of the cruelty of some behavior techiques was compeling I highly recommend this book for those wishing to examine how you can better understand and control the anxiety and stress that washes over all of us.
4,One of the best books I've read in a while,"Jeff Schwartz writes a great book that ties in his personal Buddhist experiences with mindfulness, experience as a well established UCLA psychiatrist who has had groundbreaking progress with OCD patients, and many important historical people and points. The book is well written and contains a lot of valuable information. The reason I give it 4 stars, is because in some parts of the book- he gets a bit redundant. It almost seems as if he is trying to stretch his book to be thicker than it needs to be. Also, organization- although some chapters were well woven together- there were a lot of additional facts and concepts that didn't need to be there. He dedicated a whole chapter to quantum mechanics, in my view, to impress his colleagues more than having relevance to the rest of the book. Perhaps I am mistaken, I'll have to read it again in a few years."
2,Dont be misled by the title,"Scholarly and valid, but doesnt really expand on its intriguing premise.Much better is Gordon Rattray Taylor's Natural History of the Mind"
5,Counting Book,"This counting book has simple text that invites the reader to find a certain number of items on a page. Bright color photographs, and good math questions. Excellent book for students from K through the 2nd grade, and is recommended for the teachers, as well."
3,Blah!,"This album is sort of boring.. it seems all of Nick's creativity went into ""Tupelo"" and he didn't know what to do with the rest of the album. There are maybe two other songs that are passable but then he waxes a little too experimental with his delta blues persona. I could live without this one in my collection, but I suppose since I already own it..."
4,Hellvis Presley,"Nick Cave is a man who has inspired extremes of loyalty. Heralded as a Messiah of Goth during his Birthday Party years in the early '80s, his career as singer-poet with Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds has followed a perverse and fascinating road.Melding Captain Beefheart with bone-hard blues, the record suggested a new melancholy in Nick Cave's writing. First Born Is Dead is all about Nick Cave's obsession with Elvis Presley, as the opening rainstorm of Tupelo bears out. The accents of the American Deep South tangle with grim Biblical imagery of retribution, death and prophecy: Well Saturday gives what Sunday steals/A child is born on his brother's heels/Come Sunday morn the first-born is dead/In a shoebox tied with a ribbon of red."
4,looks like good quality,I came on time and is pretty hefty. very convenit that is comes with 4 terminals. only reason im rating it a 4 star insted of 5 is that the page lies saying that it is a 8' cable it is only a 6' like in pic.
1,a company you want to stay away from!!!,"my statement above are based on bitter experience with this company, for some time in terms of unfair costumer service attitude and support."
1,Looks like a nice product,"DOA out of the Box. I must say that it's probably the worst type of MOBO to come DOA, ever try installing a Micro-ATX MOBO?Everything powers up,all LED's on MOBO are green, yet no video out....Disappointing."
4,Almost Perfect,"I bought these headphones more than a year ago at a local bargain store and was shocked to find out how good they were. The sound is absolutely amazing. In fact, I'm having a difficult time finding replacements for them because when I actually do side-by-side comparisons between these headphones and other sets, these come out on top.For all of their amazing performance, I have to say that I do wish these headphones were more durable. The connection at the switch is weak, and takes a little wiggling to get working properly. I was concerned about the fragility of the swivel connections - they don't look very strong - so I have taken extra care to make sure that I put them away properly. They haven't broken.For the most part, the minor connection issue hasn't been enough of an annoyance to inspire me to get another set of headphones."
5,WOW!,"These Headphones are GREAT! They sound PHENOMENAL! And, for those who unlike me find the length of the cord to be too long, simply fold up a section in the middle and use either a bread tie or a rubber band to tie it up. Better to be too long than too short. And from a materials engineering point of view, this Company is indeed generous. Thank You, New York!"
2,I'd rather have Sony or Koss,"These things were fine when I first got them, but within an hour of listening to them the right earphone started fading away. As far as sound goes, they can not be compared to Sony, or even Koss. I tried these phones on my stereo, iPod, and TV and with all three it felt like the sound was coming through a tin can.After I bought these things I wished that I had gone to a retailer and tested them before buying them, if I had I never would have bought them. Do yourself a favor before buying headphones on line, and go to a retailer that sells the headphones your interested in and test drive them before buying.P.S. as far as comfort they weren't all that bad, that's why I gave this product 2 stars."
4,A-MAZE-ING,This book is amazing! It was very detailed about every story. Every heading provides the perfect place to stop for the night so you have the energy to read the next day. This book is just simply enthralling.I would recommend this book.
1,Rip Off,"I have not even read the whole book and I`m mad. This book is GREEK myths, not Roman myths. Not one greek name is used. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. They started talking about Diana. They mean a DIFFERENT goddesss. I am 11. Even i know the difference.-APPALLED"
2,Favorite Roman Myths!,"Good stories, but as the previous reviewer commented, this book uses all Roman god names. It is totally wrong. Some Greeks would be seriously insulted."
3,"poor reception,poor battery life, but nice sound quality","This radio has some very nice features to its credit---size, digital tuning, battery operation for portability,MP3 input,decent sound quality from the speaker, but the AM reception was horrible and the FM was not much better,even with the antenne. If your just interested in close local stations its fine. I purchase this mainly because of the portable use with the built in battery.After a week the battery would not hold a charge, I call customer service, and the tech told me the batteries were only meant to last a year????? I exchanged it for another r2, same battery problem same reception problems."
4,good. Not as good as boston's models,Ignoring price difference I'd give this a good rating. I'd give excellent to the boston models.This may only be problem with my unit:Aux input has a hum problem.The battery which came with it does not work. As soon as power is lost you lose all your settings. It uses a 7.2V teac nicad battery.===================They sent me a replacement battery which worked. But battery life is short. Radio reception is average. Speaker sound quality is very good.
2,Read on...,"I picked up one of these for our bedroom for twenty five (with a discount coupon). It's great looking radio with good reception and above average sound quality. It's also very easy to use and the built-in rechargable battery is a smart feature. Unfortunately, it has one critical flaw. The display is so bright that it's practically unusable at night time in a dark bedroom. Even in the dimmed state it lights up half the room. In addition, when the battery is charging, an extremely bright blue LED light (ever more overused in electronics these days) next to the power button keeps flashing until charging is complete. Unless you sleep in a very bright room (next to a street light) and have many night lights in your room, I would not recommend this radio. Perhaps a future R3 will replace the LED with an ambient light sensor to automatically adjust brightness. For the price I paid, I decided to keep it and use it in the garage."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,"To even call the Teac R2 AM/FM a radio is to do a disservice to real radios. It may look like a radio but in reality it's designed to best serve its owner more as an overpriced paperweight. Its AM reception was consistently somewhere between feeble and non-existent ... do not buy a Teac R2 radio if you want to listen to a station that has a broadcast tower more than two miles from where you live. It will not pick up any AM signal any further away than that. Moreover, what others have said about the ""flashlight"" like qualities of it's display module are also true. After nine months of trying make a go of it with this POS (which wouldn't even work properly when I added a Select-A-Tenna AM antenna to help it out) I've given up and gone to a C Crane CCRadioPlus."
3,Good for what I paid,"I paid $29.00 at Microcenter, and have been using one of these for several years now. It is generally easy to use and looks and sounds good. The bright blinking LED while charging is an annoyance, so occasionally I have to cover it. My biggest gripe is the power of the backup battery. I thought this could double as an emergency radio when the power goes out (we have a lot of brown outs), but when it loses power it only keeps the time settings. If you try to turn the radio on, it flashes the display, and promptly loses all power and all settings. So you have to take a few min. to reprogram everything. Otherwise I still like it."
1,Good sound - poor battery life,"Got this on sale from a local store for a lot less than the prices listed here. Have been very satisfied with the sound quality and it's reception, although the station that I listen to is very local. I agree that the brightness of the dial is annoying and I had to put some black tape over the LED so that it wouldn't bother me. The big disappointment is that the battery pack has now died and even though I never planned on using it without power, it will now not work at all. I presume that since the battery pack is now dead that it won't pass the power on through to the radio even though it is plugged into AC power. I haven't yet spoken to TEAC to find out how much a replacement battery pack is. Having the battery pack is a nice feature, but it should work even without a battery pack installed."
3,Shame about the middle bits,"I agree with another reviewer on this site: the introduction and summary are the best bits. Mr Stove has an annoying habit of letting his personal politics interfere with the story. This does not come through too badly in the earlier pieces, but his right-wing views become obvious when discussing the 20th century and unnecessarily so.It is a fascinating topic. I would love to read a better book about it."
2,Pretty Pathetic,Not compatible with about anything. FM reception is terrible. Pretty sorry product even for $20
1,You get what you pay for!,"The FM tuner didn't work and downloading music was next to impossible. I would have returned it, but my son threw out half of the original packaging. I thought it would be a inexpensive option for my 10 year old, but it turned out to be a $20 piece of plastic."
5,Comparison.....,"""To Bring You My Love"", P.J. Harvey's third album, is one of the best albums that most people haven't had grace their ears. The best description I can come up with is this: ""TBYML"" is like heroin for your eardrums. And I'm talking the best heroin, EVER. If you haven't heard this album, I pity you."
5,Perfect,"Perfect albums come very rarely. But PJ Harvey has done it. She is my favorite, and even though I love all her stuff, this is her best, without a doubt. There's something here for everyone: Meet Ze Monsta and Long Snake Moan recalls her Rid of Me and 4-Track Demos- era raw wailing, but she also transcends to a more epic, almost theatrical style here. It's not a long album, but the SCOPE of it seems huge. If you are a PJ Harvey fan at all, buy this one. It will change the way you perceive women in music, and you will realize why Polly Harvey is so underrated."
4,PJ Brings It On,"PJ Harvey came into her own of her third release, the guttural To Bring You My Love. The title track starts the album off with a reverberated, fuzz guitar attack that sets the tone for the album. It is a personal, fierce song and is brilliant. ""Meet Ze Monster"" follows with the same piercing effect. ""C'mon Billy"" and ""Long Snake Moan"" are top-notch tracks as well. Ms. Harvey summons up the ghosts of Marianne Faithful & Patti Smith with deeply personal and feral songs that rage with an underbelly of understanding & softness."
2,"questionable service, questionable quality","It took the company 3 weeks to ship this one cd. 2 weeks after I made my purchase, I sent a polite email stating that my credit card has already been charged but I have yet to receive my product. My email was never returned! When I received the cd, finally, it has some skips in it and was not playable on my computer for some reason."
4,A few duds but otherwise extremely creative and unique,"Every once and a while, and artist releases material that is deemed as ""groundbreaking"" because it combines elements from other music to produce a sound that is all it's own. Be warned - TGYML is not very accessible, save for a few tracks; is moody and somber - just the companion to listen to alone in the dark. Most listeners have heard ""Down by the Water"" by now. Other highlights include ""Working for the Man"" ""C'mon Billy"" ""Telco"" and ""Send his Love to Me"". In a perfect world PJ Harvey, Liz Phair and Elastica would be enjoying the exposure the likes of Alanis Morissette, Jewel and Melissa Etheridge have during the decade. But, hey, this is the nineties..."
1,"Yoko Ono????????Gross, Bad Hippie Vegan music...","My girlfriend found this cd at a resale shop and we put it in and groaned at the long intros, and the flailing voice of a self proclaimed misuderstood artist. Not even 2,000 years from now will she be famous. No real artistic talent other than being weird, and usually weird is good, but in her case it wa Yoko Ono weird, and that's not good, not good at all."
1,This Is Crap,"I know it's not me, but I found nothing on this CD even remotely listenable. This is horrible crap. Apparently, those who deem it great and all must have all of their taste in their mouth. After I listened to my copy I am now using it as a coaster. Works better that way."
4,To Bring You My Love,"To Bring You My Love being Harvey's 1995 release and received great reviews from the critics when the album was released and the album did reasonably well peaking at #12 in the UK Album charts and #40 in the Billboard 200. Singles of this album where ""Down by the water"", ""C'Mon Billy"" and ""Send his love to me"". The booklet contains no lyrics, some nice photos of Ms Harvey and a list of whom and what they play on each track. 4/5."
5,Masterful,"Polly Jean has always suprised us with her incredible music. But on this landmark disc she launches herself to a upper level of greatness of musician's of the 90's or any other decade. Yes, that's right this may one of the two greatest dics of the 90's. It opens with one of the most powerful and scary songs you've ever heard. It ends on a beautiful but very unique note. Get this disc, take your time with it and the payoffs are nothing short of amazing !"
5,This IS Beyond Everything...,"That quote below about God being here - is so captivating. When she says it, the faint sound a swinging guitar riff begins to come in and the bass truns up. Sheer brilliance.By the way, ""I Think I'm a Mother"" isn't really a dud. Of course, it's different. She sings strangely on it - but it's still catchy and the bass is AWESOME.This is truly, along with Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" and Portishead's ""Dummy,"" one of the GREATEST ALBUMS OF THE DECADE."
1,Through The Years,"I thought Doc Holiday was supposed to be Southern Rock, this album is crap. Don't buy it unless you into slow, mushy music."
