5,A Review of Angels & Ministers of Grace,"Michelle O'Leary has written a great Sci-Fi adventure and love story with her second novel Angels and Ministers of Grace. All the characters-whether human or alien-are well written and come to life on the pages. The worlds she creates for her characters have the complexities that Sci-Fi lovers enjoy, and the romance that evolves between Anya and Jason is a wild ride itself! Full of emotion, world-building, and alien creatures, this is a wonderful story to curl up with and read in one sitting.AJ CaywoodAuthor of Stay in the Light"
1,not true to picture,The picture of the items for sale is different from what I got. The picture clearly shows 3 (three ) items.. I received only one! This is a rip off! I am extremely unhappy with this purchase!
5,My son LOVES it!,"My son loves this book, every night he wants to read this book. He even took it to school saying that this was his FAVORITE book! =)"
4,spiderman,"It is very nice looking and well made. Just be careful when apply the legs, it wrinkles when you apply them."
5,nice and easy,"from unwrapping to sticking them to the wall took about 5 mins. Very easy to do. There are five pieces of the spiderman's body, you just need to be little careful to peel them off. It sticks to the painted wall well and looks quite cool. My 4 year old son loves it! Highly recommend it!"
5,Awesome Decal,I purchased this wall decal for my son who loves spiderman. I was very impressed with the quality of color! very bright and vivid. The size is also great. Totally worth every penny.
4,Solid for the price,"The character looks great on my wall, but it is tricky/impossible to get the seams of the arms lined up perfectly. That said, you can barely tell from any reasonable distance, hence the 4-star rating."
3,Keeps falling down,The idea is great and once it stays up it looks good but each part of the body has fallen down at least once. I don't understand why.
5,Excellent Poster,"Very easy to put together. Sticks easily to the wall and comes off cleanly. Nice, big size, looks well-made. Perfect for any kids bedroom."
3,Quality OK,"Seemed to work well for the first couple of days.... until it kept half falling of the wall, have put it back up many times. Its been up for about 5 months now and you can see all the areas where the stickers meet (comes in 5 different pieces) because it shrank!"
3,Didn't stick,When we put it up on my son's wall he absolutely loved it! Then the next day when he woke up in the morning it was hanging half off the wall. Every day we had to fix it when it was falling off again. Until finally we left for a weekend and it had fallen off and wasn't fixable. I'm not sure what kind of walls you need for this to stick?
5,"Great Decal, Reasonable Price","I got this for my Uncle as a Christmas gift. He is a huge Spiderman fan and put this right on the wall of his living room.Let me say, this is the first wall decal that (not only that I got) I have seen. The shading really makes this thing jump out, no pun intended. It went up easy and looks like it isn't just going to peel off by itself any time soon. And compared to the costs of something of a more known name like FatHead, the pricing was fantastic.Also, even though it is just a decal and not really fragile, they made sure it was protected during shipping. The product came encased in those air-packet things in a box three times the size of the product itself. And it was two days earlier than the expected shipping dates!"
1,Dunno what is wrong with spidey!,"I have put Thor, Capt. America, Ironman and other decors at my kid's walls, with the movie he wanted spiderman, so I got it, same brand, roommates, it lasted one week, and then started to peel away and fall from the wall. The others are great after 4 months now, this one for some reason is a piece of crap, the vinyl is a bit thicker, so it might be it, but it does not holds to the same wall where the others are.I also have cinderella, snow white, aurora and bella at my girl's room, no problem, when I bought this one I also bought her Merida, no problems, it is just spidey!"
5,Spiderman the protector,My son is obsessed with Spiderman. This was a Christmas gift. He told me the other day that he sees ghosts & bats at night but he's not scared because he has Spiderman in his room to protect him. I wish I had one when I was a kid.Very easy to install. Removeable & reusable. I would buy this item again & wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others. Very cool looking. I feel like I am a hip parent who did something cool for his boy.
5,AWESOME!!!,This is my son's favorite thing in his room. We hung it above his bed and he high five's spiderman every night before we tuck him in . . . this is a great addition to a little boy's room . . . AND it is VERY reasonably priced . . . I have seen similar items that sell for over $120!
4,The Essential Edgar Cayce,"""I have become interested in A.R.E. I have read most of ""There is River"" which is Edgar Cayce's biography. So far I have not been able to fully understand just what Edgar Cayce's positions are on various spiritual matters. ""The Essential Edgar Cayce"" is much more useful for understanding what Edgar Cayce is saying. It is well written and gives many insights."
3,Not that great!,"This author talk way too much about nonsense and then follow with a couple of Cayce's readings...and then talk more nonsense and then a couple offical readings and more nonsense and then readings and then nonsense....readings, nonsense, readings, nonsense...you get the idea. This and the Akashic Record book belong in dust collection shelve. I recommend There is a River and No Soul Left Behind."
2,Pretty cheap,"While the price is low, it's not nearly as low as the quality. The item looks like something that you would get from a 25 cent machine at the enterance to a grocery store. The mold marks are painfully evident, it doesn't look like the manufacturer put any effort into cleaning it up after it came from the assembly line, and it just screams ""massed produced shlock."""
5,Awesome product,A nice replacement to the stock Toshiba AC adapter. It was smaller than the stock product and contained a breakaway in case of an accident.
3,Ac Adapter,It works fine. Has a real tight fit which I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Very disappointed in the length of the cord. Other than that it powers the laptop as expected.
1,HiCapacity Sux,"I got this adapter as a result of my original frying out. Had a 3 year extended warranty through BestBuy and they gave me this instead of an original toshiba product.The actual plug that goes in to the laptop power socket is detachable, so it looks more like a part of a universal power adapter. I thought that was an advantage, but after about a month or so, the cord started falling down. Finally the connection between the universal plug and the adapter to fit the laptop also became loose! Even when it looked like it was connected, my laptop was frequently shifting to battery and going to stand-by very often. Figured out it was due to constant internal sparking due to the loose connection.bad design! Stay away from this. It is cheap for a reason."
1,The real Hendrix was good enough!,"This is junk. If you want to hear a real violinist, there are plenty of players far better then Mr. Kennedy, who's playing seems to be deliberatly ugly and shapeless. If you want to hear the real Jimi Hendrix, he left a rich recorded legacy."
5,"Stunning renditions of Hendrix ""classics""","I gotta agree with the music fan from Michigan...kudos to NK for this bute of an album.Knowing full well that this wasn't to be symphonic classic music, I found this to be very refreshing. All me fave Jimi tunes being set to the frantic urgency of Kennedy's flailing bow, and the accompanying musos bringing their brilliance into line with him, seems to work for me. Of course I was really anxious to see if he would colour between the lines, or would it stray. I think his interpretation is truly wondrous.I'd like to see this guy play with Daevid Allen and Gong, which he was rumoured to be doing for this years Glastonbury Festival, but alas, it wasn't to be.Allinall, a worthy cover of Jimi, but probably not everyone's cuppa tea. Oh well....4tea6zee"
2,Head phones plug broke in 2 months,Work okay over all for two months then the head phone plug broken from the inside so no more music. Have to return for service :-)
2,Sergey,"The worst MP3 player I've ever seen:1. I need to reinsert SD card after turning it on, it won't find files otherwise.2. It doesn't remember settings and last position3. Crappy quality, SD slot broke the same day I received itAnyway it is dirt-cheap, and it works (hence 2 stars)."
1,Returned it without opening,"After doing much research and comparing quality/efficiency/cost I decided on the Blueair line of purifiers. I contacted the company to find out where the 250E was manufactured. I was told that it was manufactured in Sweden/Germany/Texas USA.When the purifier arrived, I noticed, prominently printed on the box, MADE IN CHINA. I returned it without opening it. I can not justify owning a heath product manufactured in a country that allows the use of lead and other poisonous material in manufacturing."
5,Awesome machine,This is the best purifier I've ever used. Removed odors from kitchen within 10 minutes. Also removed dog odors very quickly. It is also very quiet. I have a pair of Honeywell 500250's that I paid 158.00 for each. They work well for dust etc. but are loud and do not remove odors near as well. The downside to the BlueAir is the cost of the filters. I would buy again however.
1,"Made in China, Fan motor chirping","It's designed in Sweden but made in PRC.I actually took it apart when the motor started making this annoying chirping sound after less than 24 months. If you look at the Blueair website, they sell a bunch of refurbished ones because all they do is replace the fan motor.The housing looks hi-tech but it's just held by rivets and cheap machine screws. Inside the thin steel is a styrofoam casing and a plastic cover. A super quiet bathroom exhaust fan with a large car cabin filter!It does filter stuff but the retail is ridiculous for what you get. I would give it 5 stars if it was $80 and it came with 2 filters.If you're ok with throwing it way after 2-3 years, get it."
3,New to Us,We have other Makita tools use Boush mostly in this type we are trying for the first time so far so good.
2,Not that good,"I loved the Wingman series! But this is just trash. Somehow being as bad or worse than terrorists doesn't inspire me. In too many scenes the ""good"" guys don't know if they're killing the enemy or just innocent by-standers. How's that going to stop terrorism? It won't. It will just inspire others to act against the US since the US obviously is acting out of hate, not out of a sense of justice. The ending of the 1st book means I'll give the next book a chance, but if it's just more hate killing, I drop this series fast."
1,SUPER HAWKS - STRIKE FORCE ALPHA,THIS BOOK STUNK!!! I WAS NOT AT ALL IMPRESSED WITH THIS BOOK. THE STORY LINE WAS WEAK AND IT HAD TO MUCH VIOLENCE. IT MADE THE USA LOOK BAD! MR MALONEY'S BOOKS ARE USUALLY 100% BETTER THAN THIS ONE!!!
5,A breath of fresh air from the past...,"The concepts here are age old, and at the very core of the American People. Remember Pearl Harbor, Remember the Maine and Remember the Alamo were battle cries of the past. The current battle cry of ""Remember 9/11"" is right in line of the American design of rallying around a specific incident. Mr. Maloney is absolutely carrying on the American Ideal. If you attack this sleeping giant... be afraid, be very afraid. This is a mirror of the Mosad's tactics. It would definitely be useful in counteracting terrorism. Thank You Mack Maloney for yet another awesome book."
5,top notch,"Pure stainless,very sharp and made in Japan by Fijiyama...some vendors sell these for 2x this price.Paid $62.00"
4,Dough Blade,This is my third Cuisinart Dough Blade I've had to order during my ownership of the Cuisinart food processor (over 15 years). This is an essential tool for me. The inner component will break if under too much pressure. The item I received was not a used item but it was old because the plastic had yellowed. I hope the inner component is secure and does not break because of age. We'll see as I continue to use it.
3,Fun to watch but useless for Male travelers,"I enjoyed the videos but to be honest, now that I'm in Europe nothing they had to tell me was of any value. The travel information was too vague and there wasn't enough city specific information taht I could use. I'm thinking a travel show that focuses on one city is a smarter option. Too much to see and too little time in one hour to give any clear hints, tips or help.It is also unfair that they use a female host since so many of the places she visits won't allow stays for men. ""This convent is only for women, but it's cheap and quiet."" She might want to add, ""Oh, did I forget to mention anything to help out you guys, well sour grapes to you.I miss Ian.I still love Globe Trekker but I'll view it with more than a few ""grains of salt"" next time I watch."
3,"good, but problems","This shoulder rest works very well, but after only month of use, the padding has peeled back."
5,A delightful story,"I have never seen this book before today, but it caught my eye because it is illustrated by Robert Lawson, one of my favorite illustrators. It is about a city woman who moves to a farm. She misses the noise of the city. One by one she adds animals to add noise to her little farm. One day, she is driving down the road and hears a wonderful noise. She investigates and discovers that it is coming from a home for boys. She decides to take the two noisiest boys home with her and finally solves her problem! Sweet story and delightful Lawson illustrations throughout."
3,Great for Smoothie,"I just bought this blender a week ago. Not from Amazon because its price was too high. First when I added it to my cart, it was about $45. Right after I did, the price went to $69. I decided to check out Brandsmart and saw two blenders that had same functions as this one. Mine came with frosted glass which was cheaper than the clear glass. I got mine under $30 + sales tax. I've used it 2 times so far and think it does the job (I only want to make smoothies. I don't use food processor I've had.) I gave it 3 stars because I don't know how long it'll last yet and I wish that it could probably had 2 variable speeds for other purposes. But so far, so good..."
1,Defective Blender,After two uses the Oster Pro Blender is total junk; leaking water from pitcher bearing into the motor compartment destroying the motor. Warranty policies are deceptive and evasive that such a disreputable company as Better Chef Direct shouldn't be allowed to advertise on Amazon.
2,1/2 horse power?,1/2 horse power is only a little over 300 watts? so this blender has less power than a $10.00 blender not sure where the Power is coming from???
2,too noisy,"I made this purchase because I saved $30.00 by apply for the amazon credit card........otherwise I would not have bought this item.......it looks good but, not all that impressed has only two speeds....and it is extremely loud.........."
2,OSTER BPST02-3 BLENDER,"The blender arrived with a broken glass container; however, after checking the other parts of this blender, I was very disappointed because the plastic parts looked very cheap. I returned the blender for a refund, and I have purchased a different blender."
2,Loud enough to wake the dead!,"I don't like it at all. The blender is soooo loud I actually need hearing protection (think concrete drill). The kids all run from the room when I'm making smoothies and I plug my ears. The product works great though. It crushes ice well and makes creamy smoothies. I think by ""Professional Series"" they mean it needs to be in a blender box when you turn it on (like Starbucks). Other than that it's ok, but because of the noise, I hope to replace it soon."
5,Oh what a joy to use!,"This blender is fantastic! I make fruit smoothies from frozen fruits every morning and the old blender I had would take 10 min to make it and this one less than one minute. Who ever said it was hard to attach the jar to the base must be joking, it could not be easier, you just put it on and thats it. I absolutely love this blender! The base is heavy and sturdy and sits well on countertop due to big rubber feet, the jar cleans easily in dishwasher. Oh yeah, and its nice to look at too, no need to hide this one away when not in use. Not a single bad thing to say."
3,"good, bad & ugly","first thing it did was suck the pour spout topper into the chamber and grind it to a fine pulp. blender action -- good, with caveat. then the base cracked -- always hand washed and never seen a dishwasher -- during a mayo production. nice mess. haven't even bothered to replace broken parts -- just about a third of the cost with shipping. blender action is very good though, all other things aside. noisy as hell, though. spend some extra bucks if you plan to use often, otherwise, for the occasional whirl, it'll do -- until something breaks."
3,Same problem as pictured,"I have had an Oster beehive blender about three years and have used almost every day to make smoothies; that's about 1000 times of heavy duty use, chopping ice and frozen fruit. I have always been satisfied with Oster; my last Oster blender lasted about forty years being used almost the same way. So, I was very disappointed when today my blender broke...the same as in the small pictures above. I am reluctant to purchase another brand as I now have a few extra containers which come in very handy when making drinks for a crowd so, I am undecided on what brand to purchase."
5,Great Blender,"I decided to get this blender after seeing all the positive reviews and the price really clinched it. I especially like the glass jar as all my other blenders have had plastic jars which over time developed small cracks. There is only 2 speeds with this blender but that's probably all that is necessary, because the motor whips, grinds, chops everything without any problem. You can't go wrong with this purchase."
2,"OK for a little while, then Poof!","Trying to go up market to a reliable blender, I got the Oster after my super-cheapo burned out quickly. Thinking, ""It's Oster, right?"" - so it will be good, I got this one, intending to use it to mix up puppy mush using already-finely-ground meat and milk. Since I have maybe one litter a year, this task should not exactly be heavy lifting for a good blender. It worked fine last fall, then was used a couple of times for routine kitchen tasks afterward. Today it burned out without warning while pureeing puppy food. I know it came at a good price, but once a day use for a total of perhaps 3 weeks over a year... not good value, no matter what the price."
4,Fine Blender,"Works well. Crushes ice and makes drinks pretty well. It's better to push the toggle switch down which causes it to run at a lower speed. The liquid keeps moving and the ice crushes just fine. With the switch pushed up and the blender on, the blade spins at higher speeds which sometimes causes a thick drink to have an airpocket to form above the blade so nothing moves. Not the end of the world but causes one to either stir the slurry or jiggle the blender."
4,Works great!,"This blender is all I needed. Two speeds is plenty and simple for making milkshakes, smoothies, frozen drinks, etc. It is a tad bit loud but mixes quickly, so the loud sound doesn't have time to get obnoxious. I recommend it!"
2,Sorry I bought it,"I bought this blender to crush ice in protein shakes based on all the glowing reviews. I thought the complaints about the noise were over reactions. Boy, was I wrong. The sound that this blender makes is horrendous! If it weren't so much effort to send it back, I would have done so immediately after my first use. And, it really doesn't do that great of a job crushing ice. The number of times you have to stop the motor, scrape the contents down so that they will continue to blend just isn't worth it! Contents just can't get over or around that air pocket that forms at the bottom of the jar. Far better to buy the Waring Pro electric ice crusher and use your old blender. I did and am much happier. If this is your first blender, try something that doesn't come with an ear protector warning!"
3,Powerful But VERY Noisy,I own the Oster BPST02-B and it runs very very noisy. On the plus side it is very powerful and the all-metal drive does seem solid. Note that this only has one-speed (if you count the pulse option then its two-speeds). I wouldn't waste money on the 1-cup (mini-jar) chopper attachment. Its too small and all plastic.
2,Don't get it for Smoothies,"I'm having trouble understanding how people could be raving about how great this blender is. It is nice-looking, and I don't care that it only has two speeds. But ice or other frozen chunks don't get pulled down into the blades, perhaps because the jar is narrow. And it is so loud it is like having a helicopter in our kitchen."
4,nice blender for the price!,"I drink a lot of smoothies using spinach and kale. Because of this, I've been through a couple of blenders. It's just not something that every blender can handle.This blender has done a really good job for me. Mixes everything I need for a ""green smoothie"" and does a good job of it. Not was powerful as some blenders I've used, sich as the Blend Tec or Vitamix, but it's also about 20% of the price.If you're looking for an inexpensive, yet powerful blender, this one does a great job!"
4,Oster BPST02-B Blender,Very prompt delivery on the blender! This Oster blender is sturdy and simple to use and in the design of the appliance. Looks great in the kitchen.
2,Bad design,"I liked this blender. Powerful, attractive and makes a nice smoothie. After light usage for 3 years it broke. The plastic base section that connects to the jar broke. I read some reviews and see that I am not alone. I usually dont write amazon reviews even though I buy dozens of products but thought I'd give everyone a heads up. Now I am back on amazon looking for a more durable blender. :-\"
1,This is not a professionl blender. The rubber piece in tha all metal drive breaks.,As in the pictures there is a part that breaks in this if you make smoothies. Ice Plus Bee Hive equals lots of failures. I have complained to Oster and they did send me a free blender but it has the same problem and apparantly the new part are not very good because I had one break after less than a week. This blender is not for professional or any kind of hard use. The company is not responsive at all to fixing the problem.
1,weak motor,"I purchased one of these and I have to say, they are made in china and have a weak motor. It is 1/2 a horse power, which is equal to 372 watts. If your looking for a blender that is completely made out of metal, the base and the drive system are solid steel and the pitcher is made of all glass. Get a older Oster. The ones made before the 80's are old school, but they are made to last. They were made in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, not CHINA and come with 800 watts of power, back when they used big motors on things.Your not going to be able to blend frozen fruits and chop ice with a 372 watt motor. The reason why VitaMix are good is because they are made just like the old school Osters, but you do not need to spend $500+ on a blender. Just buy vintage Oster and your be able to get one for under $70 used. Things made in the 60's and 70's that were made by Americans were made to LAST!!!"
4,"Works great, powerful",This great looking blender works great. We also use the attachment for the single cup to easily make smoothies. It only has one mode but thats all you need.
1,The Lid Stinks,"Be forewarned, as two other reviewers have pointed out: unfortunately, the pressure that the machine puts out causes the liquid (soup, in my case) level to rise to the point of dislodging the plastic center cap. In my case, I had my hand over the lid and the cap popped into the blender (and soup) and promptly cracked and broke. Considering its price and appearance of durability, I planned on using this machine for much more than just mixing a marg but I have a feeling that's going to be its limit for me. Now, the next dilemma is finding a replacement cap..."
2,Disapointed,"This blender worked great while it worked, but after a year, the motor stopped working. My husband said that the motor burnt out. I would not spend the money to repair because it didnt make sense."
2,Does Not Blend Frozen Fruit,"The blender is a nightmare for those trying to blend frozen fruit. Because it only has one speed, it does not allow you to gradually increase and immediately creates an air pocket which stops the blending process. You have to keep stopping and bring the smoothie back down with a spoon to the blade so you can try to finish. This is also an unusually loud blender and one we as avid smoothie drinkers were really disappointed in. It does crush ice and blend well if you are not using frozen fruit, but again, if you like a thick smoothie, it still makes that air pocket."
3,Easily replaced breaks and those that cannot,"Breaking a rubber gasket is not cause to criticize a blender, but breaking the driver shaft is most definitely.It depends what is put into the blender to make it break. My last one died after a piece of unchopped parsley was caught in the turning mechanism and burned out the motor. Since motors cannot be repaired or easily replaced that means a new machine. A big negative.The rubberized gaskets are nothing. I bought 10 of them last time I ordered at the hardware store. They are inexpensive and need replacement now and then.I want an Oster like the one I received after I was married 40 years ago. It would made out of metal and lasted 35 years."
4,Loud but Functional,"Love the look of this blender. It is, however, as other reviewers have mentioned, VERY loud - much more so than any other blender I've used before. I use it primarily for smoothies, and find that I do need to use a spatula or spoon mid-spin to get ingredients to move down toward the blades. So, for the price, not bad; but also not perfect."
5,Blender that CRUSHES ice,This one is LOUD when working but does the job. I've used it every day around 6:00pm with no problem except splatter until I found out how to stop that. I really don't like the rubbery lid.
5,WEDDING GIFT FOR DAUGHTER,The BEST blender I have seen! Oster has done it again. Simple powerful good looks AMAZON can't lose.
2,Not good for frozen fruit - smoothie makers beware!,"I bought this blender because of all the rave reviews it received in using it to make smoothies. Please note that if you plan on blending FROZEN chunks of anything, it has a hard time pulling chunks to the blades. I use it primarily for fruit smoothies with small frozen fruit chunks and everytime I make one I have to stop the blender several times to manually push the chunks down toward the blades. It spins incredibly fast, creating a pocket of air right above the blades, which is probably why the frozen chunks don't get pulled down to the bottom. Not sure if the taller skinnier jar design has anything to do with that, either. Once everything reaches the blades, it does completely pulverize solids, but it takes several manual attempts to get the food to reach the blades.Also, WOW, this is one loud blender! You almost need ear protection to use it! Best of luck!"
2,I'd Find Somethig Else Before This Blender,"It is the loudest appliance I've ever owned or heard in my life. I can be in the back room of the house when my wife is using it and it will still drive me crazy. You can imagine how loud it is when it is me actually using it.The second downer is, while being extremely loud, the unit goes berserk vibrating and moving all over the counter while blending. It is literally a chore to try to hold it still and keep the jar and everything in place.Third bad thing is that we've had it only a little over a year and it is starting to break, we are looking for a new one now from a different manufacturer. The reasons we bought this unit originally were from the good reviews and the single serving cup attachment, sadly it wasn't worth it.The only one thing i can say good about the blender is when it does work it does blend ""okay""."
5,Great Blender - Best One I've Had Yet...,"GREAT BLENDER! I've had mine for about a year and a half now with no problems. I blend frozen bananas and blue berries daily. The entire blender appears to be made of quality workmanship. My only concern is the bottom of the glass container is plastic, so I could see it cracking if it's sat down on a hard surface too hard. However, I would definitely purchase this item again (hopefully I won't have to for a long time). A+++"
5,Powerful Blender,"After reading all of the reviews, I decided to purchase this blender. I use it almost exclusively to make smoothies with fruit, juice, yogurt, and ice. Other reviewers complained about it not mixing thoroughly. I found that it works best if you pulse twice to thoroughly circulate the chunks of fruit, juice, and ice that are near the blades. After the pulsing, use the switch in the ON position until thoroughly blended. If you put too much ice in, the mix gets too thick for the blender to circulate. I remedy this by adding more ""warm"" juice. I have no complaints about this blender. I am 100% happy with my purchase. (I use it once daily.)"
4,Paid too much!,Last week I went to Brand Smart and they had the same blender for 28 dollars. I paid 42 dollarson Amazon. Very disappointed with price difference.JC
2,Not good with forzen fruit,I bought this blender because of the excellent reviews on Amazon.com. I wanted to make smoothies with frozen fruit and the blender really struggled. I had to stop and stir several times. My previous Braun blender did a much better job but it is no longer available to purchase.
5,BEST BLENDER EVER,"This is by far the best blender I have ever used. Blends ice like there is no tomorrow, I mean no chunks what-so-ever. I highly recommend this blender for frozen drinks....."
5,Like it a lot - would recommend to everyone,Got the item the day it was projected to come to me. Looks sharp - works great. Other reviewers are correct when they say it is a bit loud - but it's a blender - what do you expect?
1,Disagree!,"The 2nd time I used this blender was to blend soup. The liquid spurted up, dislodged the plastic cap which then sank into the soup and was pulverized. Goodbye soup. Basically, it does look like a very strong motor but the immediate high speed and flimsy top have their liabilities. My hand was on the lid so it wasn't a matter of inattention. Maybe good for ice but if you are using this for a variety of kitchen tasks then definitely get a model with more speeds."
1,Broke in only two months!!!,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM. I bought this in July and it broke by September. The plastic holding ""the only all metal drive system in its category"" broke while using it to make smoothies...Needless to say, I will not purchase this item again."
1,Plug In Jet Engine,"Though this blender was extremely powerful and industrial looking, it was WAY WAY WAY too loud. I mean ear splitting tooth grinding loud. It was a cross between a 747 engine and a dental drill. It's practically unsafe to operate this blender without hearing protection.If you don't mind the noise, this Oster performed well. It made pretty good smoothies and I could throw in whole frozen strawberries without slowing it down.Due to the noise, I gave it away after using it a handful of times and bought a Vitamix blender instead, which I'm very happy with. If you use a blender a lot, the Vitamix is worth the money."
5,Great Mixer,"My wife loves this new mixer I got for her, and I enjoy the friday drinks she makes with it.It is not fancy but just works great. You won't regret getting it."
1,Worked For Three Weeks,"I received the blender on 06/04/08 and began using it shortly thereafter to make daily smoothies. However, on 06/27/08 I noticed that the blades had stopped turning. When I took the blender apart, I noticed that the silver thing that fits into the center of the base (the drive?)--was no longer attached and could not turn the blades. I was very disappointed because I expected great things with such a powerful motor.Amazon gave me the option of replacement or refund. I'm going to try the blender again. If this one does the same thing, I will request a refund."
2,Same problem as others - not good with frozen fruit,"Since the only thing we use this blender for is fruit smoothies, it's a bit annoying that the thing can't really handle frozen fruit. The fruit doesn't get down to the bottom and it creates an air pocket. I have to use a wooden spoon to stir every few seconds of blending.Huge disappointment. I think this would work better if the base was wider and if the blade went in both directions. My parents have the Oster Fusion. We tried the frozen drink button and we got the perfect smoothie. May go ahead and try that one."
1,"If You Don't Want Hearing Loss, Don't Use This","This blender really does work very well, but the noise has too many decibels! It actually hurts my ears and because of that is going back today."
5,Great product great price,"Oddly, one of the things I most like about this blender is that it reminds me of my electric train when I was a kid: solid, heavy, powerful. The motor sounds metal instead of hybrid or plastic. And finally a blender that will really crush ice without cavitating (forming a bubble around the blades). I cannot believe you can get something of this quality for such a low price."
4,Loud Awakening,"I Purchased This Blender after reading countless reviews. It looks great, Can handle almost anything...I usually blend just fruits and greens with it. the consistency is very smooth just after 5 minutes. Sometimes I have to cut the frozen fruit into smaller pieces so it can blend...No complaints pretty much does it job ."
2,Not worth the price tag,"I just received this blender in the mail. I bought it after the cheap blender that I had been using started failing mechanically. I thought I would buy a more expensive one this time, and I liked the looks of the professional Oster. To my disappointment, the blender looks and feels very cheap. The lid is plastic and very flimsy, as well as the silver colored plastic piece around the pitcher base. The bottom of the unit is also plastic. I haven't used the blender yet, but I am so put off by all its cheap qualities. Its so different than pictured, and I don't feel its worth the price tag."
2,the all metal drive broke after 5 uses,"the suppsedly all metal drive is actually plastic and rubber and it broke withein the first 5 uses while makeing hummus!(not using frozen fruits, just chicken peas out of the can...) i have not been able to get the replasement part on hte web, i might have to send it in. good luck>"
4,Great Customer Service!,"Model # PST2. Looks the same as the BPST02-B and was sold as the Prof Blender 2 months ago. Great Blender till the bottom came off. I can grind grain w/ it up to a point (then I sift it and grind the large parts again). Grinds spices very well (all spice, cinnamon sticks and smaller spices). Makes great smoothies. Malts are better w/ the shake attachment which is sold separately.About the bottom: The black plastic bottom's threads seem to have worn out. I've had the blender almost 2 months. The bottom just keeps turning and doesn't grip the glass base tight enough to hold it on. The last smoothie I made ended up all over the counter when I lifted the jar off the blender and the plastic bottom remained behind.I've e-mailed Oyster. I'll update when I receive a reply.4 hours later: No need to update at a later date. Their Customer Service Dept has already responded. A replacement bottom is on its way to my house. That's CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
5,Awsome,This is the best blender I have ever owned. I almost purchased a blender recommended by Consumer Reports but after reading customer reviews on Amazon I went with this blender and I'm glad I did. It seems to be extremely durable and the two speeds are all I ever need. I've used this primarily for Margaritta's and it does a great job of crushing the ice. You will not need to manually assit the blender in creating the top to bottom swirl/suction. The noise is not a bother since it blends faster than the average blender.
4,Does the job,"This is a good, heavy duty blender. As some others have noted, it is loud, but one gets used to it. We have used it for everything, from blending soup to making ice slush. I would give it five stars if it had more than two speeds, however it gives good value for the money and we are quite satisfied with it."
5,Miracle Grow for Writers,This book has so touched my heart and helped me work through God's plan for my writing. Marlene has an incredible ability to put into words the perfect perspective and insight to draw out a writer's thoughts. I'm taking my time with this Bible study so that I can glean from it every ounce of spiritual nutrients I know I need. God obviously knew I would need it also because he laid it on my heart to buy the book.I encourage anyone who wants to be led by the Holy Spirit in their writing to buy the book. It's worth every penny and then some.
3,Some good information.,"I enjoyed this devotional. The only thing I would change is the number of Bible references in the Appendix. It's too hard to read in a daily devotional way, when there are so many verses to reference. Other than that, it is really chalk full of information that helps in the writing process. I think you will really enjoy it!"
4,Write His Answer,"Great book, Marlene will walk you step by step. You will learn what it takes and will know for sure if you are called to wirte."
5,Balm For A Writer's Soul,"I have just read this remarkable book for the first time--for I plan to go back and read it again, slowly. It is sorely needed refreshment for the struggling Christian writer. It's also practical, easy to read, supportive and yet challenging. The book consists of thirty-three short chapters, with a supporting structure of Scriptural references, simple homework assignments, and plentiful examples from the author's own struggles. Just reading it is refreshing and soothing--thre is something remarkably restorative about the author's plain-spoken style. Some of the subjects she covers include dealing with rejection; doubt and despair; maintaining balance; and keeping up one's physical health. In short, this is a powerful book about the spirituality of Christian writing. I recommend it most highly."
2,Something's Missing,"I purchased this book to review for the CEN, and to brush up on my general emergency nursing knowledge. So far I have made it to page 451 (out of 800+) and I am rather disappointed. Many of the nuances that could make this a great text simply aren't there--such as tricks of the trade and drug info and more background on conditions. In addition, there just doesn't seem to be any life to this book. Ok, granted it is a textbook---but I have read textbooks before with some life in them, and this isn't one of them. It is so boring and dull it just makes me want to cry. I start to read and find myself several hours latter drooling all over the book, wishing that I had been abducted by aliens as that would have been a better way to past the time. Finally, this book glosses over several common ER complaints, does not cover several others, and seeds the material that it does provide with errors and outdated facts. I am, however, determined to finish reading it and to pass the CEN."
2,What a disappointment,"I purchased this book because the ENA Core Curriculum has gone to a new edition and used copies don't seem to be available anywhere. (Have been trying to get one since June 07.) This book seems to skim over many important topics and I find that although I haven't yet completed my BSN, I already know most of the information in the book. Like other reviewers, I was expecting more skill/technique information and emergency nursing insight."
3,Where's the beef?,"I'm a new grad RN going to the ER and I think I'll function better and learn faster after reading this book.Book has a lot of filler but not a lot of good crucial information. It seems the author's goal was more to get the page count up than to deliver needed info.Way, way over priced for what it is."
4,Bad girl makes goooood!,"This is a hysterically funny song that had me in stitches when I heard it, and when I saw the video, I just rolled about laughing whilst thoroughly enjoying the outrageous lyrics from Princess Superstar.Of course I only heard the ""edited"" version, but when I went out and bought the CD, I also got the ""unedited"" version which is quite explicit in parts so if you are easily offended don't buy this song!It's not real rap as we know it but sometimes you have to take the Mickey out of a subject that sometimes takes itself too seriously.I mean remember Afro-man and his ""Crazy Rap"" that was a big hit a couple of years ago? Now that is a song as wickedly funny and downright rude as this one, even more so in fact!So enjoy ""Bad Babysitter"" and try not to think, ""Hell, is my Babysitter like this when I'm not at home?????"""
5,Great book for meditation,"I have had this book for one of my meditation courses at the Advaita Meditation Center. My instructor refers to this book as ""the"" translation for Bhagavad Gita. Leaving aside all religious connotations, the book gives the reader a chance to understand the verses word by word. Sanskrit never seemed so easier to understand. Each sutra is worth its weight when you set it aside for meditation. We were advised to take one sutra, say ""Austerity of Speech"" (Chapter 15, verse 17) and practice it while interacting with folks in home, work, or elsewhere. Meditating upon it brings deeper insights which you then go back and try it on field (implying in practical life).I am having this book from the library but I hope Amazon can come up with a kindle version for this. You can carry it everywhere. Imagine the possibilities :-)"
5,May God Bless Sargeant W,Sargeant W's efforts are helpful to Sanskrit lovers/learners. Sargeant Krishna & Sage Vyasa's message is made more transparent to sanskrit learners.
5,Eminently fulfills its aim,Simple Layout and really a fantastic effort. Only feedback is Fonts could have been little bigger. Cross referencing Ramanuja's interpretation where applicable was really unexpectedly handy and fabulous. This book is a must for any begining student of bagavat gita.
1,conspiracy ...flop,arab conspiracy ...and the next man ..are the same movie...and sean connery had done better movies than this ...
4,Good Sean Connery Movie,This was a gift for my wife who is Sean's biggest fan. This is a good movie. Not his best but far from some of his others. A must have if you collect Sean Connery movies.
1,Sound Engineer With A Mind Of His Own,"This DVD was a HUGE disappointment. The promise of an exciting and wonderful concert by the magnificent James Levine turned out to be a farce. The fault was NOT with the Berlin Philharmoniker or the conductor, but with the sound engineer, who had a mind of his own. Like old-time radio engineers, who pulled back the loud sections of music, he (or she) decided that some sections of the music were just too much for home listeners to stand. I have hundreds of DVDs, many of the Berlin Philharmoniker, and none of them have this problem. The excitement of the music was destroyed by the distortion of the music and its dynamics. I am certain that Levine and certainly not the producers of this DVD are aware of the problem i havedescribed. It never should have been released. It is not the fault of my DVD player or sound system. Three friends also havecomplained to me of the same thing."
2,May be OK for CDs but not good for DVDs,"I bought these for labeling DVDs. While the labels are very thick, they do not completely mask the printing underneath.Also, after labeling a bunch of DVDRs, I had trouble with read errors, stutters and freezes. At first, I attributed it to bad DVDRs or scratched discs, but it was happening on almost every disc. As a last resort, I scrubbed one label off with a brillo pad. There was still residue on the disc, but the read errors were gone.So, unless the three different DVD players I tried them on are unusually finicky, I wouldn't recommend these labels for DVDs."
2,cd's ok dvd's no,"the older labels work great the newer ones are great for cd but not dvd freezes and comes up with error codes on three players.real drag because i found out after labeling a large amount of dvd's. like other review took a couple labels off dvd plays fine, bummer.labels looked great."
5,Avery 98122 CD Stomper Labels,I have been using these labels for about 5 years now and find they are simply the easiest to use because of their included handles and they display very nice images from my ink jet printer.
4,Better than Avery name brand,"I print 20 to 30 CD labels a day, sometimes one at a time, and I much prefer CD Stomper labels over the Avery name brand labels for one simple reason. You can run the sheet through the printer a second time after one label is printed. On the Avery brand labels, the backing has cuts/slits in it that get caught in the printer if you run the sheet through after removing one of the labels. I do wish the perforations around the center circle were cut a little better on this brand. It's sometimes tricky getting out the center without ripping the label. Perhaps Avery can work on providing the best qualities of their two labels."
2,not a good pick,"CCR is one of my favorite bands, but this is a poor collection of songs minus a few. Unless you are a real fan, you are best to look elsewhere (the chronicals vol 1 and 2 for most)"
3,Heavily Edited,"Warning to those thinking of buying this book: the music is heavily edited according to late romantic sensibilities. The editor has added dynamic markings and crescendos as well as slurs. For those wishing to play these pieces on the harpischord or organ with the original articulation--the text is not clean, and it is not at all clear which markings are original and which are editorial. This is unfortunate, because many of the other Dover early music titles reporduce reliable editions (for instance, the Dover editions of Bach reproduce the reliable Bachgesellschaft Ed.)."
3,surfing into the a psychedelic retro summer.. egads!,"Maybe this is pathetic .. but I like it, as much as I hate it,because it reminds me of how much I wanted to be like morrison at one point, and yet as purely a fan of morrison, I think my allusions are sickingly blatant to the point of overkill, and the whole thing kind of embarrasses me, but then I listen to it,and it's like, that's OK.. because even so, it is different. I step outside myself and forgive my over zealousness, and tounge-in-cheek references, and find myself hearing it as though someone just came out with it... and I immediately think Doors.Most doors fans hate me, and I don't blame them really.. because theyreally can be only one Jim Morrison, and he remains someone Igreatly admire, but I'm a different person than I was back when I was growing up and playing music. This music is a part of my past; a tribute to The Doors, The Dead, my friends, music, and history."
5,Macho Man Rules,WCW did a great job with this movie. It tells all about his career in WCW and the sucess in his career. If you are a wrestling fan you must have this.
2,It was ok. Couldve been better,"I have all of the Superstar Series movies and this one just doesnt live up to the other ones. I dont know why its so hard to find.I hope they come out with more in the series and updated versions of the current ones. Id go for Goldberg, Sting, or Nash before this"
3,Decent for the price,I bought this to have as a dog model for fleece jackets I'm making as gifts and it serves my purposes. My only complaint is that the legs are not sturdy and it does not stand well on it's own which makes it hard to work with sometimes. Overall I'm pleased and would buy from this seller again.
2,Not as advertised,"This was supposed to be ""extra small"" It turned out to be a small. I have a small one already."
4,"SO FAR, SO GOOD!","I used this oil for my last oil change in my 1998 Chevrolet Prizm (115,000 miles), and I've noticed that my gas mileage is better. I usually fill all the way up every week, but this past week, I didn't fill the tank all the way, and I was still able to go a full week on 3/4 of a tank without refilling :)"
3,Not a pretty good choice,This book doesn't contain all the essential medical words encountered at normal situations. It's worth of 3-star rating cause it encloses 16 pages awarding-winning illustration. Recommend to advance users.
3,Chance to see how mores have changed,"I saw this film first run my freshman year in college. I probably was amused by it, since it is clever. Watching it again is a good lesson on how attitudes can change over time. The movies is 40 years old and tells the story of two straight men who want to avoid the Vietnam draft by acting gay. Michael Greer is the best in the film, he is gay and was able to be 'real' in the part. There is no heavy message here, more of a time capsule piece."
2,"Dated, sub-par, sitcom-feel spoof","It would be okay to be a little dated if the story and writing had been tighter, more interesting, and if the movie had a better ending. I kept expecting something to happen or some change to occur, but it pretty much just lurches on with a one-joke storyline until it runs out of steam and is mercifully over.There are a couple good scenes and some interesting moments, but the story wanders all over the place and never finds it's rhythm. It's interesting for its time, but still sub-par.This isn't really a ""gay movie"" as it's really about two straight men pretending to be gay, even though they are somewhat homophobic. I guess it would have been too shocking to depict them as accepting, although they seem to make some progress toward the end.Dated and not very involving or interesting (or funny.) I'd avoid this one unless you like older movies and feel like tolerating the homophobia."
5,The must have for WKO+ user,"First I've bought power tap hub. Started to train with power. Than I've started to use WKO+ software. But thanks these book I do realy feel what the trainings with power are all about it. Very supportive, easy to understand, easy to implement."
2,"Not a Complete Waste, but...","This book is worth buying for the sample training plan in the appendix. The rest of the book is pretty poorly written and it seems a lot of chaff to wade through (and compelling arguments why you should subscribe to their web service) for the substance. But my FTP has jumped nearly 30% in the last year and a half, in large part due to that training plan in the back."
3,Triathlete Training with Power,"not a book i have sat down and read from cover to cover, however i have read areas of interest or need. helps one better understand how to train with power"
2,A Promotional book for a website,"I was expecting this book to help me learn about my power meter and it's usage. I read over half of the book before I droped it. This book is for the ""BIG RACER"" not for someone that just wants to have fun and ride. From my understanding you need to buy webservice from them and ride for a little while and then spend twice as much time after each ride recording the information. What you eat, what you drank. What you ate and drank the night before and the morning of the ride.I guess the book is ok and would be worth having if you use their web service. Really seemed more like an instruction manual that should be given away free if you are a paying customer on their website. All charts in the book are from their website which you have to sign up for."
2,Too slow,"It took far too long to receive this order. I inquired if this order had shipped and sender told me yes. When I received it, the order was actually shipped two days after the email was received. Total of 14 days to receive. Not anxious to place another order with sender. Item was in good condition once received though."
5,Rhymes of Passion a great CD!!!!,"This CD is one of the most creative efforts I have heard in a long time. It is Americana at its best, with strong and pure vocals and wonderful guitar pickin'. There are many musical surprises on this CD that are tasteful, and blend into a cohesive whole. Definitely worth a listen."
3,Surprisingly Watchable,"The premise is simple: some friends get trapped in a sauna, it keeps getting hotter, and they've got no way to escape.The movie is surprisingly watchable for such a premise. It wasn't scary or anything, but as you get to know the characters more and more, and as their time runs out, the movie draws you in. Unfortunately, it takes far too long to get you drawn in. By the time you're fully invested in the characters and their fate, the movie is 95% done.It's not easy to make any movie that's confined to such a small space. So that 247 did a reasonable job at it is commendable.While 247 isn't the best movie in the world, if you've got nothing else, it's not the worst choice you could make."
4,You will not go to sauna any more,"This of course in no way is my favourite movie, but it pretty descend and interesting experience. It was filmed in my country and I went to see it in theatre, with a very sceptical attitude. What I saw I was surprised, because it is not only just an intense thriller about kids locked in sauna, but rather a story full of suspense, that makes you wonder about... well I better not say what you wonder about, because it will be a spoiler, but it definitely holds on your seat and at the end in it makes you never want to go to sauna.Well one thing I can say for sure when people were leaving cinema, I just stood there and observed a very heavy faces, full of thoughts and not knowing what to say, other than considering how real being locked in the sauna can be.It's not a movie that if you don't see you missed a lot, but it's a definitely worth seeing it."
2,I think I saw this movie before when it was still called The Chaos Experiment,"I'm normally into the people-trapped-in-a-confined-space genre, but this one, not so much. Four friends go out to a lakeside cabin. Michael's Uncle Wade got them tickets to a Pagan festival, but they want to check out the sauna at the cabin first. Have I mentioned that Michael is a world class screw-up? Ian, Jenna, and Renne are trapped inside the sauna because of Michael's drunken shenanigans. He puts a ladder in front of the door, then promptly passes out on the couch. Renee's body is prominently shown off, and Jenna's is invariably covered up. Think this was a contractual thing? I have to admit Ian's breakdown scene was pretty amusing, like Ash in Army of Darkness. Don't know if that was intentional."
4,Being trapped was never so miserable..,"They have some water but they cannot fight the increasing heat, and then they start to lose it mentally as well as physically. Watch the tense tale unfold as three friends try to survive a horrible trap."
5,Great buy... highly recommended.,This item is great and so far very reliable. Highly recommended for the individual with a life on the road.trust me.
5,Great thumbdrive!,Great little drive for moving data between computers. Price was very good and delivery was fast. Highly recommended!
3,"Unbeatable price, but....","At $17.99 for the two memory sticks, I figured I got a great deal... however... these memory sticks don't seem to run at the 'full' USB 2.0 speed. They operate faster then USB 1.1, but not as fast as it should.I borrowed one like it from someone who got theirs more recently and NOT in a twin pack and that one definitely carries out I/O much faster.Guess there was a reason they were so cheap :p"
4,Kingston 1gh flash drive,"I bought this twin pack, the units are compact and give me a way of hauling around some data that would otherwise need a CD. No failures, no problems, plug and go. I recommend the 2 pack, it is a good bargain."
2,Harvey Toons Complete Collection,"These are not the original cartoons. It would be fine for kids under 6. The discs, however are double sided, and I think they would scratch easily.If you are a geek like me and wanted the cartoons... what this appears to me is a Saturday Morning Cartoons show that just used the old harvey cartoons. The original credits are cut, and worse the cartoons are cut up.There are no menus as well.Avoid this set till a better one rolls along."
2,damage discs,"this collection contain five disc, two of which were damaged. in the future, i will make sure to purchase new disc products."
4,"Coulda Been Better, but....","This is a collection of set half-hour (well, 21 mnutes to leave time for commercials) Casper and Friends TV shows. As the other reviews say, no booklet, some cartoons no titles, and worst of all, each ""show"" ends with a ""Toon Take,"" which is a severely edited cartoon clearly whittled down to fit into the half hour format. That last is unforgivable. BUT.... after waiting for years for these cartoons on DVD and even VHS and only finding the same few public domain titles mixed in with a lot of junk, at last we can live the nostalgia, even if not in an ideal format. I had to get it ~ I'm not holding my breath for a more complete release anytime soon. Obviously the producers decided it was going to serve mainly as an electronic babysitter for a generation of new kids who don't know any better."
2,disappointing,"I always expect complete credits on any video I buy. This CD did not provide credits. This was expecialy disappointing for this collection because my father was an animator on many of these cartoons. An email to the producer of the CD was apparently ignored. The collection should not have been titled ""complete"" without complete crediting."
3,"Sub-par presentation, but only way to have these classics","I'd forgotten all about these cartoons until recently which I'd watched throughout my youth. As a fan of these shows, it was great to see them again.Purely from a nostalgic standpoint, if you're looking to remember some long-forgotten cartoons this collection is for you.However, it fails in comparison to other DVD collections. As many have stated it lacks any kind of track listing. If you're a completeist, you're going to find cartoons missing (as well as the closing credits to some of the cartoons).I'm glad I found it just to have a set of Harveytoons, but if ever a more comprehensive and better packaged set of these cartoons comes out, this set should fall by the wayside."
3,"Complete, but No Listings.","This compilation was complete in that it gave you all the Harvey Cartoons available. Unfortunately, it had NO LISTING of the Cartoons inside, so I had to go ONLINE to locate someone who was wise enough to indicate what cartoons were made and their titles and order. It was a headache and I was not Happy with all the work involved just to locate my desired cartoons. The copies are clean and bright. Just hard to locate. Box is strong and sturdy."
1,What were they thinking??,"First of all...this is NOT the complete collection. Secondly, the cartoons are butted together with hardly time for one to end before the next one begins. And lastly, there is no booklet, no listing, no menu of any kind on the DVD itself.Very shoddy package of some very fine cartoons and characters. I hate to sound like an old-timer...but why do most people not care anymore about what they produce? How could you sign you name or be part of a team that worked on this very mediocre (at best) packaging, and walk out of work with any sense of pride?Dramatic, I know, but fight the urge to be any part of mediocrity. Be proud to sign your name to anything you produce. No one should be proud of being any part of this packaging."
2,"Great concept, despicable quality...","I bought this as a x-mas gift last year. When I was able to get my hands on it, I realized that a child would have a difficult time workign the toy. Also, the mechanism was a bit faulty. The kid has a lot of fun, but it left me to wonder why Nerf didn't stick with a classic design which is not only simple but higher in quality as it cuts down on parts that break.I'll definitely preview the toys at the local toy store before buying online. I recommend that for rather than relying on advertisement and reviews."
4,Best toy gun for the money,"I purchased this for my kids at Christmas time. I only paid 5.00 for it and got free shipping due to ordering other products at the same time. For 5 dollars, it was the best bargan that I found last year and my kids still ove it."
3,Ok book if you have Linux up and running already,"This book is good only if you have Red Hat Linux 7 installed already, and everything working properly. The book is dedicated to the graphical interface: KDE and Gnome. If you have it all set up, then you're good to go and start learning. If, however, you don't, look elsewhere. The book does a poor job on how to install Red Hat Linux 7 and troubleshoot the installation and other problems. It assumes everything you did went smoothly. Overall I think if you need help navigating around Gnome/KDE, and aren't familiar with ANY Linux tool, then go for it."
4,"Do you really want to do jazz, Nigel?","I have much admiration for Nigel Kennedy. I love his classical CDs and I LOVE his rock interpretations, but somehow he misses the mark with jazz. I don't really know why--he is such a good musician. But I don't think he understands the fundamental nature of jazz, the way it lends itself to improvisation, and the ""conversational"" expression that takes place among jazz musicians while they play that makes jazz so distinctive and compeling.This is still an admirably creative endevor and worth a listen. It's just not as entertaining some of his other work."
2,"Stick to Mendelssohn, Nigel!","I have great enthusiasm for NK's classical recordings. When I found this CD in a thrift store for $1, I overcame my fear that it might be as bad as other jazz ventures I've heard by classical musicians. Even those with genius-level talent generally don't have the flexibility and spontaneity to play jazz. But for one lousy buck, why not give it a chance?Despite some nice licks by the pianist, this is going back to the thrift store immediately. Kennedy's idea of jazz playing seems to be mainly playing with bad intonation. NOT the same as some carefully chosen blue notes! Also, the violin tone on the record is horrible, and sounds like either an electric violin or a ghastly overloaded digital recording. Not recommended, even for the curious."
5,a review from the U.S.A.,"I recently not only had the great privilege of reading ""Walking to Valdieri"" by Albert M Sharon but of actually meeting Lynn Sharon, the late Albert Sharon's wife to whom he dictated his memoirs! most books about the Holocaust are always terribly depressing, but this one made me laugh and cry from start to finish! inspite of all the hardships that Albert and his family had to endure while on the run from the Nazis, it is filled with hope and optimism and I highly recommend it for both old nd young readers."
5,Really makes you think!,"Fred Petrovsky does a super job making this book come to life. As you read it, you forget this is a work of fiction, and start to think that the first brain transplant has actually occurred. The characters are so real, and their challenges and feelings so genuine, you really feel their conflicting emotions."
4,Nice ideas,I do love the ideas in this book...the only setback is that they aren't very practical for middle-class living. It's nice to dream though :)
1,noisy,"My husband likes the way it cooled the bedroom, but the sound is too loud and I could not sleep with it on. Noisier than hotel window units. We returned the product after three weeks and hope to find a quieter unit."
4,It Cools But....Could Be Better,"I recently purchased this for my girlfriend's room. The 10,000 BTU version says that it will cool a room up to 350 square feet. The room that it's in is about 150 square feet. While it does cool the room I was thinking that it would do a better job since the room is less than 1/2 the size of its maximum coverage area. It is more quiet than some window units, but it does not cool as well. I would have purchased a window unit, but they are not allowed in her townhouse complex. Maybe a 12,000 or 14,000 btu air conditioner would have worked better. Also, I purchased this at a local Lowe's store for $300 out the door. I used a 10% off coupon that I got from the post office which covered the California sales tax."
4,Wish i had more time,"i got this book for my Land Policy class and it was surprisingly good. unfortunitly i never got a chance to finish reading it but it brought up an interesting perspective on the forestry service, BLM, and the start of many other conservation organizations. its a good book to use if you are researching the history of American conservation or the reasons behind some of our laws."
5,Fountain pump,"It is quiet pump, all is plastic( except the screws ) so you won't have problem with the rust and has a long cord. I use for a 2 meters high fountain and works fine. Very good pump that I would recomend"
5,"A well written, well illustrated how-to guide on fisting","There is a difference between sex and really GOOD sex, and that the difference demands deep understanding of what the other person is feeling, physically and emotionally. Interesting sex is about communication, using rhythm, time, sensation, and mood as language. It is amazing and frustrating how often otherwise appealing people don't get this. The woman who wrote this book gets it. She does an excellent job of describing why one fists or gets fisted in the first place. As aggressive as fisting sounds she makes it very clear that it can be, in truth, an incredibly intimate experience, requiring tenderness, empathy, and patience. If you already are into it, if you're thinking about getting into it, or your partner wants you to think about getting into it...then buy this book."
5,"Fisting, I never though it would feel this good!","I loved this book. It was great, I never was intrested in fisting until I read this book, now I fist all the time, with my partner and by myself since the author goes over self fisting. I highly recomend this book for the experienced and the none experienced fister."
5,A Fistful of Fun!,"This book has changed my life! My girlfriend and I have revolutionised our moribund sex life - no more tedious doggy stuff. Now I can't wait to get home everyday from my prestigious investment banking job and lube up to the elbow. Eh up, Mr 'Erriot."
3,heh,"man...so check it out, before you actually try this on your girl, make sure it's cool first or she will get totally pissed off and ditch you and file restraining orders and stuff. It's bad news, so if you're not 300% positive, don't even go there mmmmkay?"
3,Double fisting,"I read this book and it wasnt too helpful, in the art of fisting you either have the natural talents or you dont. The only problem with double fisting is that after its like throwing a hotdog down a hallway if u know what I mean but Im past fisting its time for foot fisting. Are?"
3,I was expecting something different,I don't know what I was expecting with this book but it was a little more hardcore than I was thinking. Although you don't have to go as far as they talk about it is still a good educational book.
3,Don't waste your Time unless your a beginner...,"While the book IS loaded with info (highly advised for Beginners or Info Seekers) if you have fisted successfully more than once you probably have figured it all out already. On the other hand, er fist...if you are interesed in poetry and Deborah's ""I'm a lesbian/bisexual with multiple lovers and I'm OK"" message,which is over 1/2 the book, then get it as a conversation piece."
5,When Nothing else will do..,"When -nothing- else will do for a picky Mom, this brilliant 'how to' is your best bet. I gave it to mine this mother's day, and she's taken to her new hobby quite well. She never even has time for the grandkids! She even refers to herself as the ""Gardener with a little more than a green thumb"" with a wink in her eye. Good for you, Mom!I myself am a fan as well of the wonderful pleasure fisting brings. And I urge anyone with even the slightest interest - purchase this book! Extra kudos to the chapter dedicated to double fisting.""Love is a Fist"" -- Chasing Amy"
5,Fisting for all,I found this book to be exceptionally useful. Fisting is a long-forgotten art and one that my wife and I thought we were in a minority for enjoying. I recommend this to anyone interested in perking up their bedroom life.Raoul Duke
2,Been there done that...,My friend Dale advised me on this book. Was very dissapointed there wasn't anything on triple or quadruple fisting inside. Maybe in the revised edition when it comes out.
5,An unadulturated masterpiece,"Have you ever been fisting and thought 'Am I doing this right?'--well wonder no more. Why is this not in Oprah's book club?!? I was opposed to fisting before reading this book, but now I am one of it's most enthusiastic advocates."
1,Not worth it,Illustrations are weak (hand drawn). The author attempts to disguise her lack of writing talent by throwing as many curse words as possible into each sentence. I did not learn anything from the book.
5,Love this movie,"I am a big damsel in distress fan.I do love all those movies with giant plants thatwant to grab and suck in it's victims.I love the sacrifice scenes, the girls seam so willing at first.Time for someone to remake this classic."
1,A Difficult Meal To Digest,"Have you read the cover of this DVD?SEE: The nerve shattering Dance of DeathSEE: The Woman Eater ensnare the beauties of two continentsSEE: The hideous arms devour them in a death embraceWho writes this stuff? Well I did SEE this movie and guess what, no nerves were shattered. There are a couple of attractive women such as the popular British model Vera Day and a young redheaded beauty named Sara Leighton in her one and only movie appearance.And what about the horrific Woman Eater with the hideous arms and death embrace? Just imagine a very large, bristly pipe cleaner with appendages. Got the picture?"
1,A High Quality Film which will be remembered for years to come?,"If you were looking for such a film - then this is not the film for you. It is in the realm of a Movie Cliche like Death Race 2000, Bloodbath at the House of Death and the Conan series. It is a fun film for when you are half awake.If you want fun, watch it, otherwise give it a miss."
1,Pathetic jungle opus,"In this (ho,hum) typical quest for an elixer to prolong life, the villain will stop at nothing to obtain his syrum, feeding it to his wife while giving the bodies to a vegetable like creature returned from the jungle along with a worshipper. BORRRRRRIIIIINNNNGGGG!!! This flick is not quite as good as KONGA and not quite as bad as anything else (see Ed WOOD). It probably qualifies for some laughs."
5,Steven Raichlen Tuscan BBQ Grill,"We use this grill on everything, our gas Weber grill, camping on top of the campground grills that who knows what has been on them. The triangle shape of this grill gets extra hot and it makes nice grill marks on steaks, chicken or whatever. We don't use the legs we just set it on top of our gas and charcoal BBQ's and use it with the legs in the fireplace in bad weather. We like it so much we have bought others for gifts."
2,wallet,"I bought this wallet for my husband who is quite rought with his accessories. When I received the item, I didn't think it would hold up to the ""abuse"" he inflicts on his wallets because the wallet didn't seem sturdy. The material was a bit soft and lightweight."
2,Too big and too small,"It's unbelievable that a wallet could be both at the same time. In the ""too big"" case, its almost twice as big and just as fat as my old trifold with the same amount of stuff in it. In the ""too small"" case, I can barely fit my bills in it. Another annoyance is they put a mesh where my ID would go. What is the point in that? I have to pull it out anyway to show it because the ID cannot be read through the mesh.On the plus side the zipper does seem to hold up very well and that is the only reason why I haven't chucked this expensive wallet.UPDATE: It has been two years since I bought this thing and the zipper finally gave out. Bad wallet. Now I can buy another one."
2,Too small...,Nice wallet...but who are they kidding? The bill compartment is even too small for US dollars. The zipper would cut into the bills every time I wanted to close the wallet.
2,Disappointing,"I purchased the based on the positive reviews but was very disappointed with this product. Especially from a company that makes an excellent product such as their pocket tools range. The wallet is just too small and does not hold your currency properly. In all fairness they did say LIGHTWEIGHT TRAVEL WALLET and they meant it, hence only three slots for your cards. If you are looking for an everyday wallet this is not for you. On the positive side the build quality seems solid."
3,NOT for the global traveler!,"Great wallet in many ways - secure and durable. But the description says it can hold almost all size currencies and is great for the global traveler which is absolutely not the case. As a USA only wallet it gets 5 stars, but for global travel only 1 star."
5,Victorinox zip around wallet,"I bought this wallet for my husband's birthday and it was a big hit with him. It is light and slender and he loves the zip-around feature,says it is the most comfortable wallet he has carried in a long time. It arrived in good time, shipped faster than I expected."
4,Awesome while the zipper lasts,"I have had two of these wallets over the past 4+ years. They last ~2 years for me personally before the zipper starts to wear out completely. I love the idea of the wallet and they're great while they last, but the most critical feature isn't high enough quality to justify the price in my opinion. If they could beef up the quality of the zipper (stainless steel maybe?) I would gladly pay twice the price for a longer lasting (ideally lifetime) wallet. However, I still give it a 4 star since I love the wallet while it works."
5,Perfect solution for credit cards falling out.,"This wallet has solved the problem of credit cards falling out. Normally, a wallet will start to lose the ability to hold credit cards as leather gets stretched out, etc. This wallet has a zip-around feature so nothing is ever going to fall out. It's also very slim... a perfect 5 star from me!"
2,Do these guys have a Conductor?,"I am a very hearty Percy Grainger fan, but I am very dissappointed with the quality of the pieces on this CD. While the strings and Phillip Martin on the piano seem to carry their weight fairly well (the recording of Mock Morris is very nice), the wind players leave much to be desired. Balance and stylistic problems plague this CD. The first trumpet plays decent but can't time his breaths worth anything and the low woodwinds and brass put out a pitiful amount of sound. The flute's interpretation in ""Blithe Bells"" is stylistically terrible. There is also a horrible electronically synthesized solo in ""Green Bushes"" (Imitating Bassoon maybe???) which completely destroys that piece. Overall I'm very unhappy with this CD. If you're looking for Grainger, purchase the Chandos Grainger Edition CD's with the Royal Northern College of Music Wind Ensemble. Those CD's are vastly superior to this poor attempt at Grainger."
5,Salmonson is better than your favorite fantasy author. :),"In my opinion, Salmonson is among the five *best* fantasy authors of all time. In this particular oh-so-bloody-hard-to-put-down series, she writes of a female samurai's adventures in feudal Japan--a Japan replete with all of Japan's traditional magicks and supernatural creatures--in a completely believable, serious, and captivating manner. If you've a love of Japanese animation, or Japanese culture in general, or if you are one of the fantasy readers that is finding most fantasy is too juvenile for you nowadays (try Beagle also!), give her a try."
1,L.A.M.B Leather braided watch,"I am a huge lover of all things LAMB. I have bags and wallets from the collection. I have wanted the leather braided watch for 2 years so I was very excited when it went on sale. However, when the watch arrived I was very disappointed. First, the leather was very cheap and looked more like plastic. Second, the watch did not fit. I have very small wrists and it barely fit me. Third, there was no real place for the clasp to go through so you were forcing it literally through the leather. The face of the watch was small as well. I promptly returned the watch.I would not recommend this product at all"
3,Useful but not an exhausive resource,"The book is pretty good for most aquarists as all should have something to help with the diagnostics and treatment of their pets. There's some pretty good photography of various diseases that simplifies the text, and in each section there is a little box of explanation of a point in the text, be it a bacteria type or similar. Where the book falls slightly short in my opinion is in the treatment section. I would not advocate the use of all the chemicals in this chapter and some may well be impossible to obtain for most people. In this case, I would recommend using the book then visiting a professional fish keeper, specialist shop or vet with your diagnosis after consulting the treatment section to see if there is an alternative.All said and done anything that can help easy diagnosis and lead to the correct treatment of fish disease is a good thing."
4,Have No Worries About Fish With This Book,This is a huge information database on fish health and diseases in my opinion that greatly signifies the authors authority in that field. I have nothing but gratitude for this book as I have already cured my fish once with its help. The only negative is that I bought this book once on amazon and the order was canceled because of damage to the book. I got it as a birthday present later though.
2,The Trailer Trash Biography on Ethel Merman,"Obviously, this man has nothing on his mind but sex and secrets, because that is all this horrific book is about. With the exception of several interesting tidbits about ""Gypsy"" (Her dislike for Sandra Church, etc.) all this book covers is secrets about Ethel Merman and her sex life. We needn't hear about how one of her breif marriages was ruined because her husband couldn't get an erection. We needn't hear how Merman desperately tried to have an affair with ""Gypsy"" composer Jule Styne. What we want to hear is stories about her shows- the staging, the backstage turmoil and triumph.There is an interesting listing of televison shows, films and stage shows featuring Merman, however, besides that, this is utter trailer trash."
1,"Don't bother, unless............","Don't bother buying this book unless you are a fan of supermarket tabloids. There are many factual errors & the author seems far more interested in speculating about Ms. Merman's private life than in providing factual information on one of the greatest performers in Broadway history. I was furtunate enough to see Ms. Merman in all of the shows she did after 1940. She was a true original & deserves nuch, much better than she receives from this author."
1,Everything's Coming Up Razzes,"Absolute drek. But where to begin? The author's constant use of the heretofor unknown nickname ""Mermo""? His skewed critical facilities (Merman's overbearing ""Mad World"" performance was worthy of an Oscar nomination?!)? Or his near complete disregard for facts and a fractured chronology that will have even the most casual Merman observer rolling their eyes? The ""Ethel Merman Disco Album"" of star bios."
2,"Fawning, gushing, sloppy and poorly written","The book is nicely produced with excellent photos and a polished, professional look. The professionalism ends there. The writer flits randomly but amiably among first, second and third person, with breathless accounts of events that, in some cases, are exaggerated beyond recognition. The book appears not to have been fact checked (Merman and Robbins embracing after ""Rose's Turn"" in 1954????). So there has yet to be a definitive Merman biography. This one brings us no closer."
1,Not Coming Up Roses,"I thumbed through this at the bookstore; Ethel Merman is overdue for an examination of her life and career. Jumping to the end, I noticed no reference was made to her final screen appearance (a cameo) in AIRPLANE. It was as if it didn't exist.I put the book down and walked away.'Nuff said."
4,"Not just Merman, but the Broadway scene and how she fits in",Ethel Merman's stardom came from her fame in the Broadway musical; yet it's surprising to note that there aren't a large number of books on the market covering her life and career as it relates to the concurrent rise of Broadway shows. That's why ETHEL MERMAN: THE BIGGEST STAR ON BROADWAY is an important survey of not only her life but the Broadway scene as a whole: she worked with some of the biggest names of her time and their stories blend with hers in a fine biographical survey. Very highly recommended indeed.
4,Soccer Coaching: Drills That Kill!,"Drop whatever you are doing and pick upADVANCED SOCCER DRILLS. This complementary programfits in perfect with Marty Schupak's othersoccer DVDs. Detailed soccer drills!This soccer DVD set is also popular with soccer coaches, leagues, and parents.Soccer Coaching:Schupak's Soccer 6 Pack DVD Set"
2,Gilding the Lilly,"The selection of songs for this cd is excellent, however unable to leave well enough along they include overblown intros, restarts, embellishments etc making the original tune almost unrecognizable. The arranger should be shot."
3,"Great photo camera, bad video camera","Excellent camera for taking pictures, but sucks at recording videos.The quality is SO poor that the video looks as if you have recorded it with a web cam.If you are going to use it just for taking pictures, this camera is great, pretty simple, but does the job, but if you want to record videos, this is not the camera for you."
2,Not the MTV series!,"I purchased the boxed set for my son's 12th birthday. He had seen the MTV NC series, and I could see it was a fun mixture of the guys doing crazy stuff, travelling around etc.I therefore purchased the boxed set on the assumption that NC1, NC2 and NC3 meant the MTV series 1, 2 and 3.Not so!As others have mentioned, the boxed set is really just dirt bike riding, which is OK, but it's not what attracted us to the purchase. It would have been much more helpful (and accurate..) to ensure there was a clear distinction in the description, between the MTV series, and what is shown on these DVD's in the boxed set.I still don't know where to get the MTV series from!So not bad, but not actually what we were after.."
2,Not the MTV series,"Just like the other two reviews, I bought this under the assumtion that it was what my husband fell in love with on the MTV series. Not so. I wish I would have read these reviews before I made the purchase. When I saw the MTV versions listed first on the amazon search list and then I saw the box set below, I thought I was just buying the whole set of the MTV series of Nitro circus. Please read before you buy!!!"
2,Almost unusable product,"I attempted to use the grinder for over two hours, trying to grind up some chicken breast. I could not manage to get the grinder to sit still on the counter while turning the handle, and it also did not force the chicken through at all well. I finally gave up and threw the whole mess into the trash. Not a product I can recommend to anyone."
4,good product!,"It is a good product,good quality and good in using.only one thing make me confusing is the handbook. it is so simple and I can not know exactely how to assemble the 3 pasta attachments."
2,Shipped incomplete,"Product received with one part missing (coarse blade). I tried to reach Amazon via e-mail and have written the company customer service department in Everett, WA. I'm hoping to receive this part so I can at least TRY it out. Due to the ""pink slime"" news report lately I refuse to buy chopped meat."
2,Too hard on the arms!,"Bought this grinder so that I could make store-bought ground beef even more tender so that my ninety-year-old dad could chew it. But, the ground meat would not pass through the holes of the grinding plate well at all. My husband and daughter helped me by taking turns turning the handle. It took us about an hour and a half to grind 4 pounds of ground beef. Then, the meat still was not tender enough for Dad to chew. I never tried the grinding plates for mincing and those for making pasta. So, I did not give this grinder a 1 star. Perhaps it would have performed better with nuts and noodles! Return and full refund were completed in record time. Bad grinder; great customer service!"
5,Great little grinder,"We bought this to grind up deer meat (venison), and it works great. It's a sturdy little grinder that gets the job done. I'm glad that we didn't waste money by buying a more expensive one. We look forward to trying this little guy out for pasta making. I expect to use it for baby food once our little guy is old enough too."
1,Lasted 6 weeks,I purchased this grinder solely to grind chicken wings for my older dog.We used it maybe 3 times per week but after six weeks the blade broke apart.I had had a cheap traditional grinder used in Latin America for corn. This had done the job over a decade ago when our dog was a puppy. But then we would break up the wings with his jaw and I gave the grinder away. Big mistake!
4,HAven't tested it,"Bought this for my father cause he likes to make sausage and stuff with meat. Not really using it to make pasta. It comes with too many athachments, it has a great quality looks resistant, and the base sticks to the table by pressure or that stuff."
3,spend more,"small, the suction lets loose from the counter top while grinding. should've returned it for the all metal grinder think it wouldve been better"
4,Good Quality,"This grinder is pretty good! I suspect that it might grind meat a little better than it makes pasta, however. Given the fact that I had never made pasta dough, I wondered if it might be recipe-following related, but the dough was springy, as indicated in that recipe.The main thing I noted, was the pasta attachment for linguine is very easily clogged. The rotini attachment, however, worked a whole lot better."
5,Great grinder for a great price,"I feed my cat a raw food diet. Buying ground meat from the store was getting to expensive so I wanted to buy boneless meat and grind it myself. After some research and reading other reviews, I chose the Norpro grinder. For the price I paid, which was very reasonable, I am VERY happy with it. It suctions to the counter great and have had no problems with it slipping. I only use it to grind boneless raw chicken, so I can't comment on the pasta maker. It is made for smaller chunks of meat so keep that in mind. You have to make sure the attachment is screwed on tight or it will losen as you put stuff through and can get messy. After I figured that out everything worked fine. It is NOT dishwasher safe though. That's fine with me because I like to soak it in a little bleach water since I use it for the raw meat. Cleaning is easy as long as you do it right away before everything gets stuck on."
3,"No good for pasta, okay for meat","This is a sturdy item, small, not good at all for pasta. Mine just clumped up no matter how I worked it. It works fine for making sausage (patties, haven't tried links yet) the chamber is small so you can't make big batches very quickly, but it's okay for my needs. I am disappointed about not being able to make small batches of pasta though."
1,Very flimsy,"It was very light, flimsy, could not be firm with suction on the work surface. One person needs to pin it down firmly so the other can grind.I sent it back the same day. Looked and felt like a toy. I won't recommend it to anybody."
1,Poor quality control,"There are nipples on the mincing plates that fit in slots in the mincing cup to keep the plates from rotating. However, with the one I received the shaft is too long to let the nipples on the mincing plates easily fit in slots in the mincing cup so the mincing plates rotate as you turn the crank and no meat is ground. I was able to tilt the plates sideways on the shaft so one of the nipples fit in a slot and held the plates in place with one hand while I tightened the cap with the other hand to grind the meat I had. This is probably the same problem others have had who complained about the device not grinding meat. It's just poor quality control. I returned this and bought one that works fine from a local butcher."
1,Nice grinder but useless because of an Achilles' Heel,This is a nice compact grinder that suctions well to the counter (we have Formica). Unfortunately when we were grinding meat the plastic piece that receives the metal crank stripped rendering the grinder useless. It might work well for softer foods. Also the instructions were extremely minimal and it takes a while to figure out how to put it together and operate it.
2,"Works, mostly","I received this a week or so ago and have used it a couple of times since then to mince some beef.The grinder part works pretty well--nice long lever so it's not too hard to crank. But the suction cup is terrible--I ended up having to hold it with one hand, hard, while it skittered all over the counter. It slowed down the grind and made it a lot more work to use. I feel like it might work better on a perfectly smooth counter, but I wouldn't hold my breath. I still give it 2 stars because it's easy to clean and assemble and the mechanism works well."
1,Not easy to clean,"I was excited and after the positive reviews of being easy to clean, stays on your counter top, does not slide - great reviews.It does not stick to my counter top (granite, which is very smooth!), I made pasta (which was delicious) but the pasta dough came out in the front and the back and for cleaning I needed a toothpick to get all the dough out, which is now in the drain... Very painful!"
2,Disappointed,"Grinder did not adhere to surface to stabilize for grinding. The grinder did not grind in uniform pieces, thus making it's usefulness pretty dissppointing."
5,Love it!,We ground ham and it worked perfectly! It didn't take long and we only had to run it through once. I haven't used the pasta attachments yet. So unless you need to grind meat on a large scale I don't know why you'd pay for the super-expensive grinders.
2,Plastic and cheap,I bought this in hopes of having a cheap way to process a few lbs of deer at a time. The cheap plastic didn't even make it through 4 pounds... the spindle started to sheer and leave plastic bits in the meat and then the blades completely stopped cutting and wouldn't even push the meat through the front. Terrible product if you plan to use for grinding meat.
3,An adequate counter-top grinder,This grinder does the basic job of grinding. It would be improved if the shaft of the handle were longer - so it could be mounted further from the edge of the chosen surface.Assembly was a bit confusing - the instructions required more analysis than expected.It grinds meat (the reason behind the purchase) well enough to satisfy my needs.
4,Decent Light Duty Grinder,"The suction cup will fail every 10 minutes or so, but otherwise this is a decent meat grinder for light jobs. It cleans up easily (not dishwasher safe) and stores compactly."
1,Unless you like to eat plastic with your burger,"This is a very bad meat grinder. Everything gets stuck after a few moments of grinding - pasta dough, meat, etc. The worst thing, however, is that it leaves plastic shavings on the ground meat. They are so tiny that you can barely see them. Unless someone likes eating chemically processed plastic... This product couldn't have possibly passed quality control! I had to throw my meat away because of the plastic shavings! What a waste of perfect meat! It is unacceptable to sell something like that. Shameful! I am returing it as soon as possible."
1,How disappointing!,"I bought this grinder to make fresh vegetable relishes. Bad choice! It doesn't grind zuchinni, onions or bell pepper at all. The turning section did not pull the vegetables thru the blade and I couldn't force them thru either. I wouldn't recommend this item to my friends or enemies!"
1,Plastic bearing wore out in two weeks with light use.,"Used a handful of times for pasta and grinding some chicken breast. Handle fits into plastic bearing, this bearing is what wore out after two weeks of use. Poorly made."
1,It's a mistake and I don't recommend this for making noodle,"This is a terrible machine and I would like to return it because the noodles stick together and turned into a dough. After a while, the dough turned dark and grey. I suspect that the plastic materials contain contaminated harmful chemicals and should be tested."
4,GOOD BUY FOR SMALL GRINDER,"For in home limited use, it does the job very well. Quality is good..Cleaning is easy Would recomend for any home kitchen."
3,it's okay,"this blander dose the job, but if you are doing something everyday on it, don't buy it, because it will be so hard to clean it. Also, there is small empty spaces that keeps the meat on it. so if you are doing a lot of stuff with this blander I don't recommended.It work okay, and it's worth $10 not $25."
4,Good little item,"Was thinking I needed a ""heavy duty"" metal one like my mom and grandma before me, but this little guy does a great job when assembled correctly. Only had to take apart and reassemble once when a strip of tendon got wrapped around and kind of slowed things down. Can't wait to try it on some nuts, etc. Using partially frozen meat cut in strips was a great tip!"
3,For very very small light Jobs,"I tried this meat grinder. It works for burger meat (what I tried it with). The crank arm feels rather flimsy and I know if I tried to do sausage with the pork fat and the rest of what might get there I would have not been happy.So if you want to do burgers into meatball stuff and occasionally, this one works just fine. It is also very small and stores in very little space. All plastic with the exception of the crank, the cutting blade, and the cutting plate. Did I mention it is very easy to clean compared to others."
4,Rigatoni A+ Fettucini C-,"My first project with this was to make Rigatoni. I used the recipe that came with the Pasta Maker and it was super. As a matter of fact, I'm being questioned by my family as to when I'll be making it again. I thought I'd try to make fettucini instead for my second pasta making foray... the top part and bottom part of the stuff that came out was fettucini, but the middle rows spit out big globs of dough. Perhaps this was some form of ""user error"", but I was a bit dissappointed in how much more difficult it was than the rigatoni.I haven't used it to grind meat yet and will probably try to make fettucini again, just to see if I get a different result.The product arrived before expected and was packed great. It REALLY clamps down to the counter top well and I would have given 5 stars except for the fettucini fiasco."
4,not bad for the money,"This grinder works well,it will do the job.You do have to cut up the meat pretty small,if you plan on grinding more than 40 - 50 lbs. of meat,I would suggest spending more money on a quicker model,Pasta plates are nice to have,pasta is easy to make your self,, eggs and flour, oil, (optional) you can make a ton of pasta for a few dollars,and fresh pasta does taste better,and cook quicker and that saves money.It does come completley apart for cleaning pretty easy to put back together 5 seperate parts total.I choose this grinder/pasta maker because I wanted a non electric one,and it was a good price,and it had a bonus with the pasta plates.I am hppy with this item,"
1,Not happy,"This grinder does not work well. It doesn't stick to cabinet as advertised, the food hangs up in it, and lets liquid run all over. I would not buy it ever again."
2,Not great,The machine didn't work well when we tried to grind cooked meat and spinach into ravioli filling. Threw it out.
3,Grinder,I bought it for someone else so I really don't know I know that mine is older and I have had it for 40 + years and I love mine.
3,nice meat grinder,this is a nice and neat meat grinder. i was able to grind chicken and pork meat on it for my homemade sausages
4,Great for my needs,This replaces a similar grinder I had for years. I hope this lasts as long. The reason it works so well for me is that I seldom use a grinder and then for small amounts. This takes up little space and sets up easily when I need it. I only wish it could go in the dishwasher.
4,"Performs well, But it is not Made in the USA","We bought this product for making miso paste. We use it to grind the cooked soybean. It is very easy to set up, use, and clean. My mother has no problem cranking away 1 and half gallons worth of soybean paste. She is almost 70 and she felt that it was easy on her joints. The plastic is good quality plastic and the unit is nice and compact. I would have given it a 5 stars review, but the unit is made in China and not in the USA as advertised."
1,broke after 1 use,Machine jammed when I tried to grind pork. Started leaving shavings of plastic in the food when I tried to make pasta. Returning it.
2,Thought it was too good to be true for the price,"I have been interested in making my own pasta and mincing and saw the general feedback for this was quite positive so for the price I thought I would give it a go. Only got to use it once, I thought I would use it to make pasta and this struggled big time. Cheaply made machine and it showed it, really struggled to push the dough through the attachments and NO the dough was not too hard. Barely made it through this job and I cleaned it up although the handle was quite sloppy at this point, I thought that I would try and make mince with it next time as I figured that maybe the mince would be an easier chore for it. Had been in cupboard for a few months then I decided to throw it out. Cant recommend on my experience and learned the lesson that if you want a good tool you need to pay the money for one."
4,Nice little grinder,I have used this grinder many times with no problems. It is east to clean and takes up little space. Grinds both beef and pork very easily.
3,Not too bad,"This meat grinder is pretty much what you would expect for the price, it works but requires plenty of effort. Cleaning takes a bit as well but I used it to turn some good sirloin into awesome meatloaf. I tried to get it to grind bacon to put in a cheeseburger and it just mashed instead of grinding."
1,Broken on first use,"During the pasta making process, after about 20 ziti, the spindle wore against the hopper and ended up melting the spindle. The broken spindle continued to work, but not as intended. If you don't want plastic in your diet, I would recommend NOT buying this piece of junk.I can't imagine how it would work for grinding meat if it can't handle pasta dough."
1,A terrible cheap product - you get what you pay for.,"Growing up, my family used a meat grinder all the time. It was cast iron and clamped to a table and was easy to use and clean and lasted forever. I got this product thinking I would see if I liked grinding my own burger and making sausage (thanks to the pink slime reveal) before purchasing a higher quality more expensive appliance. From that perspective this inexpensive product did what I needed it to. I will be buying a better grinder. This product reminded me of the E-Z Bake Oven - like a toy. It will grind things but you will spend more time prying stuck meat out of the grinder than you ever would want. Moreover the grinder handle is longer than the body of the grinder which means that you have to awkwardly position this grinder to use it. Grrrr! Anyway, if you want to experiment a bit, this will be OK but I'd generally still tell people to go ahead and buy a better one even for your first try."
1,TERRIBLE!,"I give this 1 star only because 0 isn't an option. Pasta comes out in clumps and was unusable. Unless you are a body builder, you won't have enough strength to grind the meat for even 1 burger. Sending this back. I should have known at this price it was too good to be true"
2,Norpro Meat Grinder,"I purchased this Norpro grinder based on the feedbacks of others who bought it. My first project was green tomato, sweet pepper, and onion relish. The tomatoes wouldn't grind at all nor would the onions. And the pepper just kind of mashed up instead of grinding.. definitely NOT the grinder I needed to be using. All parts except the blade are plastic including the spiral feeding device. At most I believe this would grind COOKED meat not raw, and definitely not uncooked vegies."
1,Horrible product,This product is a joke and waste of time. I had to return it back. I can not believe Amazon would sell this item without testing it.I would never recommend it to anybody. Stay away from it....
1,Falsely advertised,"The product description mentions ""Made in USA"" multiple times. The product and manual state otherwise: Made in China for Norpro. I was expecting to receive a Made in USA product. Instead I got what I suspect is another item destined for the trash in short order."
1,MADE IN china,"The product description states that this is made in USA, but it is made in china. I've had enough experience with chinese goods to know better."
2,"FALSE ADVERTISING,",It is falsly advertised as being made in USA while it is actually made in CHINA for Norpro. To me that is false advertising. If I had known it was made in China I would not have bought it.
3,NOT MADE IN THE USA!!!,"Just received the grinder today and just to let everyone know, this IS NOT MADE IN THE USA. In the description it says it IS. It is made in China! I hope it doesn't break when I use it!"
4,Works well for most things.,"I am going to keep this review short...If you need a cheap pasta maker or meat grinder this will probably satisfy you. Despite its small size, its only real disadvantage over more expensive grinders is the ability to grind the fattiest of foods. excess fat MUST be trimmed from steak or the grinder will back up. This grinder has been fine with everything I've thrown at it other than a fatty chuck steak."
2,Mushy meat,"This review is from: Norpro Meat Grinder, Mincer, and Pasta Maker (Kitchen)I've used this food grinder twice. The first time the grinder seemed to work alright, but not super, but alright. The second time the grinder made meat mush. Both times I sliced the meat thin, chilled it well, and tried to grind it.The positives about this grinder:Easy to assembleEasy to cleanDo not recommend."
4,Good grinder,I have used this one time since I purchased it. The suction cup on the bottom is quite strong and makes the grinder very stable. The quality of the ground meat was also very uniform.
2,Too hard to use,I bought this grinder last year. My purpose was to use it for grinding meat but I found it very hard to use it. You have to hold it when you grind the meat and you will also have to clean the plate often. Each time I ground about 2 pounds of pork and my hands ended up sore.
5,Can't beat it for the price,"I've only used this quite a bit for grinding meats and it works just fine.Although a lot of it is plastic, the ""business"" components are stainless steel, and the plastic is a very hard smooth plastic that's easy to clean. Everything comes apart easily for cleaning and there are really no parts that would trap any particles. All internal parts are easily accessible.The suction cup base holds fine on any reasonably smooth surface. The handle is quite long, which makes it easy to turn, but it extends past the bottom of the base so you have to position it so that it hangs off the edge of the table or countertop.Have to say that I have no complaints, especially at this price."
4,6 lbs of sausage the first time with no problem,Bought this to make deer sausage for the first time and it worked great. The suction mechanism is awesome on granite counter and no way was it going to release. The grinding mechanism was smooth and I ground 6 pounds in probably 15-20 minutes with little effort. The clean up is easy in the sink with hot soapy water. For the cost I don't see how you can go wrong. Why pay for an expensive kitchen aid attachment unless you are making 30 pounds. For the every now and then use I would recommend this grinder.
4,Great grinder,If you are looking for a industrial grinder this is not it. I use this grinder for making cat food and general kitchen grinding. It works great. I tried it for pasta but went out and got a pasta machine after the second time I tried it. It will do pasta but does not work well like a pasta machine. It cleans up nicely and sticks to the counter very well.
5,Nice Grinder and easy to clean,"It is cheap, compact and light, easy to store and easy to clean. It is good for small amount of meat."
1,The promise was fake,"I was delighted when I received this grinder, mincer and pasta maker, BUT the handle that you turn to make it stick by suction to a counter is two small to get a good hold on and I can't turn it. My daughter did turn it for me but the suction didn't last. The product is unusable."
1,Cheap,"I bought this product for two purposes, to grind meat and make pasta. The grinding of the meat was ok, minus having to constantly clear out the blades, because they would become jammed with meat that it wouldn't push out. The second day I had the product I decided to my demise to make pasta. Once I was through about half of my dough, the piece that connects to the handle broke, rendering the entire device useless. My recommendation is to buy a meat grinder that does not have cheap plastic to form a vital function of the machine. This machine worked for meat, but couldn't push out dough. Do not buy this item, invest in a better product."
5,Works fine.,"I needed a small grinder to grind chicken breast for my kids, so I could get more out of expensive organic chicken that I buy )This little grinder does the job right.The only negative is cleaning it, but its the same for all of the meat grinders, electrical or not.Have not used for pasta making yet."
1,As International Diva said...........,"I only gave it a ""1"" because I couldn't give it a ""0""!! Don't bother.Same experience as above.I should have purchased this from Amazon, I would have gotten my money back.The store I bought it from refused to take it back and told me to call Norpro. Norpro would not replace it and referred me back to my retailer, even though I told them they had already adamantly refused it. I then suggested that perhaps Norpro could send me ANYTHING in exchange - even a pair of kitchen tongs. The refused that, ""not in our policy"".Amazon would have done me better.Terrible product. Terrible customer service from manufacturer. Amazon should discontinue this item."
1,Thew the entire thing into the garbage,"I let my frustration get the best of me with the Norpro Meat Grinder as I was trying to grind up a piece of tenderloin for meatballs. Any amount of fat not trimmed off of the cut of meat will jam up the blades and the entire operation comes to a halt. Twice in the course of grinding up two small tenderloins I had to disassemble the entire thing, pull strings of fat & partially ground meat off of the blades and strainer, rinse the entire thing and reassemble it. After it jammed a third time into the garbage it went.If you only want to make meatballs and you are willing to trim every last bit of fat off of the meat then the Norpro Grinder is inexpensive, works very well, cleans easily, is small and doesn't require much storage. I really like the idea of having total control over my food so I am going to keep looking for a different unit."
1,A Superficial Overview,"You might like this book for a quick reference, but it offers very little. It certainly is not worth the full price."
5,"Elegant, atmospheric, amusing","A charming summer idyll that re-creates the gracious era of great houses, wealthy eccentrics, langourous flirtations among the well-mannered guests. The authentic period details and likable characters make this a wonderful vacation book...or a book to help recapture that hedonistic vacation mood."
3,Plays ok,"This set plays ok. The sound is not bad. It just does not have an ""off"" button. Haven't figure out how to turn this thing off yet. I mostly use it nowadays to turn cassettes into mp3's using the male to male adapter and plugging into my computer."
3,sony wm-fx290 tape walkman,"I bought this Walkman to listen to some old cassette recordings, including mostly conversations and some music. I'm glad I bought it, and would buy it again for the same reasons.PROS1. plays my old cassettes with adequate (music) to good (voice) sound quality2. easily jacks into my computer and inputs into my SOUND STUDIO (Mac) recording program, which does an excellent job turning the contents into CDs.3. affordable relative to the reasons I needed itCONS1. no counter or any way of telling where you are in a cassette, or even which side is playing. All of these disadvantages can be overcome, but it takes time. Easiest is to dump the entire cassette to the computer and edit from there.2. only runs on batteries"
3,disappointing,Sony Walkman Digital Tuning Weather FM/AM Stereo Cassette Player (Silver)Pretty cumbersome to use....wish I had purchased one with auto reverse. The headphones are uncomfortable( become too snug quickly). I found getting device in and out of belt attachment quite awkward. Good sound.
4,Good tape player.,"I used this to transfer around 80 audio cassettes to my computer so I could get rid of the tapes and save space. Overall it worked well and did the job. No tapes were eaten in the process There are only two things that I wish were included in the product. One was some way to adjust bass & treble. Also, I wish there was an AC port so that it can be ran using an AC Adapter instead of running it off batteries. Other than that, it did the job. Now that I'm done transferring my tapes, I'll likely keep it around in case I need a weather or portable FM/AM radio."
5,"Excellent, helps with grieving of your loved one","During the devastating period of time when I lost my father suddenly, this book really helped me work through the pain and the void I felt. I looked forward to learning more interesting information every day."
1,This item is made in China,"This book/statue combination is fabricated in China. By purchasing it, you are supporting a government that represses the religious freedom of countless MILLIONS of people."
3,"This is not a book, but a pamphlet!","Content-wise, the information is good to excellent, but at only 54 small pages of BIG print, (plus several pages of completely out of place exercises) is disappointingly sparse. However, since this is strictly a ""how-to"" book with no theory, a little info. goes a long way. Would have liked to see more info on proper neutralization & disposal methods since he is delving into the use of very hazardous and environmentally damaging chemicals such as cyanides and chromates. Users are best advised to avoid these baths unless they are thoroughly experienced with their ramifications. In short, this is a a pamphlet that is a bit overpriced, but contains info that can't be found anywhere else."
1,Not as good as original HD broadcast. Marginally better than DVD,I would expect this to look as good or better than the original HD recording. From a distance the players are blurry and distorted. The grass is blurry and distorted. Very disappointing. I already had this on DVD--this Blu Ray isn't much of an upgrade.Garbage.
5,Another great Dale Watson album,"This 12-number Dale Watson CD is the ""tightest"" sounding release of his career.....and I certainly believe that it's due to the Ray Benson (Asleep at the Wheel) production. Of all his albums, this one is heaviest on Western Swing, and Benson's influence has created a more refined (I dare say Polished?) Dale Watson album. Still, the signature, Lefty-influenced voice of Dale is in complete control of every song here, including an outstanding cover of the classic ""Fox on the Run"". And, while the Western-swing sound is prominent, Dale's ""Never Ever"" is perfect Bakersfield Country. Unlike many albums, this one remains strong throughout. It is just criminal that Dale's music has not received the recognition that it deserves. But, as long as he continues to put out albums, I will continue to buy them."
1,Sometimes it does not work,"my cable provider gives this box when someone in my area orders the DVR service. Unfortunately, it does not always let one view what has been recorded in the past or anything you have recorded.Sometimes in order to see a recorded list I need to unplug the box and wait a minute. Then I replug it again. Then after the box reset itself ""sometimes"" I can see what I have recorded and sometimes not.Recently, after replugging the box, I went to my recorded list and everything was erased meaning all recorded shows. So right now I feel it is completely unreliable.Right now this is ONLY good for when you have 2 shows coming on at the same time and you or a group of people want to watch different shows at the same time."
1,Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8300HD DVT,"I bought this unit from my cable system provider and have a recurring problem recording programs with the unit. I've reported this problem numerous times, as it happen every two weeks, and the response of Rogers Cable in Brampton, Ontario, Canada, is to unplug the unit from the AC outlet to initiate a reset. This works only temporarily and the problem returns. The unit was bought brand-new from Rogers who is offering to replace it with a refurbished box. All my efforts at obtaining a permanent solution to this problem have failed to produce a positive response and it is impossible to get any response from the manufacturer, Scientific Atlanta, whish is now owned by Cisco. My advice to anyone who is considering investing in this DVR is to stear clear of this product."
2,Scietific-Atlanta Explorer,"Be very cautious. I do not think you can buy one of these and expect it to work unless you have the card that corresponds to your cable company.This was a waste purchase for me but I cannot blame it entirely on the dealer. I asked if it should work with my cable company and he said he was not sure.I think if you are buying to replace a bad receiver and you have the old card to put into the slot it goes, you might be OK. Otherwise, plan to get a box form your cable provider."
1,Cable Guy,Working for the cable company I can assure you these boxes are indeed not sold to the public. And as far as the company I work for if you were to purchase this box you wouldn't be able to use it. Ever. I would assume all other providers would be the same. As far as avoiding the eqp monthly charge. Your best bet is buying a TIVO. But at that time you would need to rent 1-2 (depending on the tivo) cable cards.. Which run about $2 ea per month. Is it worth the $3 savings? Maybe?
1,A Piece of Junk,"I obtained the Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8300 VDR from my cable provider. Performance went from bad to worse to dead in two weeks. Initially, HD TV video was heavily pixelated with freeze ups and gaps. Sound was garbled with gaps as well. Non-HD video was not as bad as HD, but was still poor. Later, response to the remote would freeze so I'd have to reboot the VDR and wait five minutes for it to restart. Then it would no longer record. Finally it rebooted itself and never restarted. I returned it to my cable provider and asked for a ""brand name"" VDR. They said they were out of stock of Samsung VDRs, so I opted for just a Samsung cable box rather than another Scientific Atlanta VDR. The Samsung works perfectly, and I look forward to eventually getting a Samsung VDR. As I was leaving, a guy waiting in line said: ""Those gray boxes [referring to the Scientific Atlanta VDR] are pieces of junk"". I agreed with him."
1,RUBBISH!!!,"I had this junk when I was a TW inmate, oops, customer. I went through 4 of these and 8 or 9 (maybe 10), of the SD version of this box. They would just die, some after a month or two, some after an hour. My local Time Warner actually has a drive through window with STACKS of these things on shelves...drive up and turn in the old garbage and they'll give you new.I've since gotten a SiliconDust device and EyeTV to hook into my local network. Now I have HDTV on every computer in my house, even my iPhone when I'm away!DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!!"
2,Only Okay,"I had heard one of the Slavonic Dances on my local classical music station and thought that Bernstein's interpretation was excellent! It was different than most readings and ""Lenny"" made the piece novel and very interesting. Next I checked and read some reviews. They made this CD sound rather ""ho-hum,"" but I decided to buy it anyway. I still enjoy that Slavonic Dance every time I play it, but in its entirety, this CD generally is a lack-luster set of performances. The New York Phil can be brilliant, but sometimes they just crank out the war horses, almost like circus band. In my view, this was mostly a recording session to ""crank out the war horses."""
4,A challenging read,"The novel explores a world the movies managed to miss -- the working bohemian class of the late 1940s. The narrator is extremely chatty, and there's a lot of telling instead of showing. But the effort is worth it. The two main characters -- an itinerant scholar and a playwright who props up her physically challenged husband -- are not too sympathetic, but at the end you're glad that they end up the way they do. Intertwined into the plot are some great observations on a world long plowed under by the Donald and the Rudy."
2,Mildly amusing but disappointing satire,"This satire of the New York publishing scene is full of stunning insights, to wit: publishers can be crassly commercial; the success of a book can depend more on who's pushing it than on its quality; book people can be snobbish, etc. Powell can write amusingly, but she has such distaste for her own characters that they never come to life. Her prose should have gone on a low-cholesterol diet: some of her sentences get clotted up with their own cleverness. This is the only book of Powell's that I've read; a friend told me that her books set in the midwest are better (i.e., *Dance Night*)."
1,Problems w/ Deskjet 3847,"Could not get these to print properly on my Deskjet 3847. When I printed on a regular piece of paper they came out perfect, but with the vellum paper it prints above the top margin. I think the vellum is too slippery for the rollers."
2,Magellan could have done better,"The cord works just fine, but by the time you get the USB cord and the 12v cord together, there is a lot of cord. It would make more sense to have a cigarette adapter that pluged into the back of the unit the same way the USB cord does, that way there isn't a bunch of cord attached to the unit."
3,"Does not work on eXplorist 510, 610 or 710","This says that it works on Magellan eXplorist series GPS units, but it does not work on the newer eXplorist 510, 610 or 710 units. These units require a mini USB charger cable."
5,Very Pleased,The adapter works great. I can now use my G.P.S. on the boat with no wories of the battery going dead.
3,Not all that great if you want to be heard.,"It is not really loud enough to play outside of practice without some help. Then we have the feedback problems. Very hard to overcome, but if you play with it, and find the proper place for the mic placement you can get around it. I use external mic along with attached mic to get around the low volume, high feedback issue. And it has worked out ok. But as it ages, the case leaks more and more sound that diminished even more of the precious volume needed. I have never tried any other external effect like this, so I really do not know if there is better out there. I would not buy it again if lost or stolen. And I am always looking for a better unit."
1,Don't Even Bother,"This is probably the worst talk box i have ever used. I used to own the original ""Heil"" talk box and i now own the Rocktron ""Banshee"". They tried to put everything (effect and microphones) into this little box and everything came out mediocre. Save your money and pay the difference for the ""Banshee"", it is worth it."
2,Watch band,"Beautiful watch. Obvious high quality. Do not have average sized wrists if you purchase this item! The band is definitly TOO SHORT! The description of the watch says the band is ""ladies standard"", but beware. It fit my 13 year old daughter, and that is about all."
5,Great for $19.99 and not a penny more!!,We have this and love it. I saw the price tag of $150.00 and had to write that this seller way over priced! Go else where to buy this!!!
3,Adequate,"I do like some of Stokowski's Bach transcriptions, especially the Passacaglia in c and the famous ""Komm susser Tod"" which are adequately performed here. There's probably better out there, and be aware this is a reissue of a recording done in the late 70's and is ADD. It doesn't sound that great."
3,A challenge,"Reading this book is challenging because it makes you take a hard look at yourself & your expectations. Sometimes God allows us tough situations to grow us. If you need extra conviction to hang in there in a tough marriage, read this book."
3,How to,"For the most part, this was an enjoyable and informative book. I almost always try to be kind and put 'the other person first', even when at times it feels almost impossible. She makes some good points and I enjoyed the examples/stories she used. It would be beneficial for all couples and anyone wanting a better relationship."
5,BEST Relationship Book,"I've read a lot of ""How to"" make relationships work books and she has hit the nail on the head with this one. My only suggestion, get it for the partner that does wrong! Especially if they are the type that turns things around and blames you, this book is for them. It will help you too in dealing with them. So, maybe a copy for each of you.Would help for other relationships too, not just marriage."
5,so practical,"a book for everyone. the principles apply far outside the immediate context of marriage to include relationships with children, co-workers, church family, neighbors -- all relationships. we truly need to grasp the issues of the heart in order to be the person God wants us to grow to be."
5,Excellent. A must-read for anyone who struggles with relationships!!,"Finally, a book that describes marriage for what it really is: God's gift to allow us to see Him, and make us more like Jesus. I can't recommend this book enough. It speaks on such a deeper level than 99% of the other marriage books that are superficial at best, and self-serving in general. This gets to the heart, and if you're looking for a real heart change and closer walk with God, then this is the book to read."
5,The PERFECT ice scraper,"It may seem a little foolish to bother with writing a review of something as cheap and comparatively insignificant as a simple windshield ice scraper. But I've been frustrated for years with every single plastic bladed scraper I've ever bought, until I saw this one for sale. The first thought of course is ""Oh no! The metal blade will scratch the safety glass!"" but this blade is of a softer metal than the glass coating. What's so great about it is that being metal, and thin, it shaves the ice off the windows perfectly, effortlessly, and neatly, almost as if the blade was heated or something. Buy one for every car & truck you own. Of course a bigger longer brush type window cleaner is much better for removing accumulated snow, but just for ice or especially heavy frost, this scraper is PERFECT."
5,brass scraper,"i was looking around town for a simple, basic ice scraper. all i could find were cheap brittle plastic ones or ones with all kinds of gimmicks such as padded handles. found this one here on amazon and decided to try it even though i had never had one with a brass blade. the brass blade works great. doesn't scratch my car windows. handle seems to be plenty sturdy enough. easy to store because it is not too long but still fits in the hand with room to spare."
5,Does the job quickly,"Takes hard frost off the windshield like plastic scrapers never will- very quick. Narrow blade helps get the frost off quick. After a season or two will need replacing as the edge will dull, perhaps can be sharpened but I am not sure if that could lead to scratching the glass so I just replace them."
5,The best scraper on earth,I thought that they'd stopped making ones with a bradd blade. They work 10 times better than any plastic scraper.
4,Does the job,"I wish it had a better handle, but for a woman a year out of surgery on a broken wrist it definitely solve my issue with scraping windows this winter. All the other scrapers I tried required so much pressure that my wrist would ache for hours afterwards."
5,This hits the spot,"I have to admit...I bought five of these...yes...five. This is my second brass scraper. I love them but, the first one I bought was a different style/manufacturer and the blade was very thin. If I looked at it funny, it bent, and then of course, it wouldn't scrape worth a darn. So I bought five, worried that I might get another thin blade. Boy was I wrong, the blade is thick and sturdy, and while the plastic handle is a little flimsy, I don't have any worries about the blade! A half inch of frozen rain on my windshield...not a problem, gone in seconds! I LOVE THIS SCRAPER!! There, I said it, I love it. I now have one in each of my vehicles, I gave one to my next door neighbor, I gave one to my best friend, and I have a spare in my house that we can use on our ceramic top stove if needed. Not only am I happy with my purchase (remember, I bought FIVE, yes FIVE) so is my neighbor and my best friend (and his wife). LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scraper!"
5,Awesome!,"This is the best ice scraper ever made. The blade is metal so it cuts through the hardest ice on windshields with ease. I love it so much I bought 10 the first time and passed them out to the whole family. Just bought more this year because I gave away my last one. After six years of Minnesota winters, mine hasn't worn out yet."
5,THE BEST ICE SCRAPERS,"FANTASTIC PRACTICAL STOCKING STUFFER IDEA AND THEY WERE A WELCOME GIFT. WELL MADE, THE HANDLE WON'T BREAK OFF. A MUST NEED FOR FOLKS LIVING IN COLD CLIMATES."
5,Best Ice Scraper I've Ever Owned,"I have owned one of these scrapers for over ten years a moved it from car to car as I've traded up, down and sideways. But I've never been able to find another one like it until today and I've looked every fall at the local auto parts stores and places like Target but all they carry are the crappy plastic scrapers that don't scrape the window and break by the third or fourth use.Well today I fixed that problem and ordered five scrapers so that I have one for every car, a spare and a couple to give away.Buy one and you will be glad you did.Note: I like in Oregon so while we have a lot of thin ice and frost we don't get the really bad sleet and ice storms very often so I can't attest to its use in really really nasty icy areas."
4,The best for fine frost!!,"This is a great product and it gets rid of that really fine frost that regular plastic scrapers take FOREVER to get off. It makes scraping your windows off in the winter faster and less of a pain.My reason for 4 stars though is that I believe that the 2 corners of the blade make fine scratches on my cars glass and that after many scrapings, they add up. But I can forgive this scraper for that because of the excellent job it does!!"
4,Nice and compact,"This is a great little scraper for your side windows. It's compact and flat so it's easy to store and it scrapes as efficiently/more efficiently than any other ice scraper I've had.I was concerned about it scratching the glass, but based on all the reviews and the manufacturers claims I gave it a shot. It hasn't harmed my glass at all.Overall great bargain for the money."
5,WOW,This thing works wonders. I was a little leery at first about using brass on my windshield. It does not scratch at all. Ice comes off in one swipe. The plastic scrappers would take multiple passes where this only takes one. All they need now is to make this one into a glove!
2,Scratches,"Though the scraper works great, I found that, after a few uses, my windshield was covered with tiny horizontal scratches that are only visible from the inside of the car --- especially when there is direct sunlight on the windshield. Though I always held the scraper correctly (i.e., I did not dig the corners of the blade into the ice and/or glass), perhaps I applied too much pressure as I was scraping. Whatever the reason, I now have a windshield that is covered with tiny scratches."
5,Awesome,Works so much better than anything else I have ever used! Would definitely recommend you buy this. 4 Bucks for a scraper that lasts forever. Worth it? I SAY SO!
5,Best ever,"My husband found these after researching the best scrapers. The brass is too soft to scratch the glass in your windshield, unlike steel blades. His only caveat is to be careful not to run the blade into the rubber gasket around the windshield as it can cut it. I've given them as stocking stuffers to everyone."
2,Not has I pictured from Picture.,This scraper is tiny. I think a picture of it in someones hand would would properly identify it's true length. I am sure it's a lot better than using a credit card and I will find that out tomorrow morning.
1,scratches,I bought this after I moved to Nebraska to use on the thick ice that formed on my car windshield. This worked great for the first 2-3 weeks I had it. Cleared off ice that any other tool I have used before could not. Then the last couple weeks I noticed small scratches on my window only visible from the inside. After a few more days it was getting worse and worse and I realized this scraper was puting fine horizontal scratches in my window whenever I put pressure on it to scrape off the ice.Stick with the plastic ones. They may not get all the ice off your windshield but at least they won't scratch it up.
3,"Great if you are a midget, driving a Yugo...","There is a reason this thing got an average of 4.5 stars.... Brass is the best scraper, and this is the ONLY brass ice scraper on amazon. A good competitor would have a long handle. As others have said, this thing is tiny.If you are listening manufacturer, a couple requests. 1. Please make a longer handle! Like, a lot longer. If you have to make a second model, and charge $11.99, people will still buy it. 2. Please make the brass part WIDER... it's got a very small surface area, which in turn takes longer to take ice off. 3. Please make the sticker removable. It's impossible to get it off.Again, I feel 3 stars is fair, because, although brass is inherently the best and worth 5 stars on it's own, the width of the brass and handle size of this item is ridiculous.PS... the model I received in the mail is yellow, not red. Just in case someone would like to know."
4,pleased,"i bought 5,their good little scrapers,good price, i would recommend them. the only drawbacks were their made a little cheap,and they get bent in shipping. i was able to straighten the blades, and for the money, it's a good deal."
3,A bit flimsy,"While the scraper is very reasonably priced and the brass blade is great, the handle is flimsy and I'm afraid it will break in icy conditions. Also, the shipping and handling costs from this supplier were very high...much more than the scraper itself."
3,Blade is a bit thin for my taste,"The only kind of ice scraper to have is one with a brass blade. Having said that, this ice scraper has a thinner blade than I am used to. I am concerned that it will not last as long as previous scrapers that I have had."
5,old school work every time,"Why are these things so hard to find in stores? The plastic scrapers are useless most of the time, this metal tip clears the ice better from the windshield than anything else I used. My old one lasted 8 years before the plastic handle snapped!"
3,Great scraper for the price,It's like this....For a couple of bucks it's worth buying because it scrapes well and if you're very careful it should last a while. The main criticism with this product is that the plastic is very thin and if you put too much torque on the scraper when scraping your windshield you will break it. You have to have a bit of patience when using this item which will be hard sometimes when you are outside in the freezing cold. Overall still a decent scraper.
3,Why are people so amazed by this??,"After reading reviews on this ice scrapper I thought this was some sort of miracle invention. The price dropped to around $4.00 so I decided why not give it a go. This thing probably cost a quarter to manufacture. The size of this scrapper does not make it very practical. I guess if you drive a smart car and the ice storm left a light dusting on your windshield, this is the scrapper for you. So if you need something to do a ""quick"" job and can fit in your glove box this is the scrapper for you."
2,Cheaper and smaller than I thought it would be.,"My headline says it all. I have a brass ice scraper that I bought 15 years ago. I felt like it was time to replace it. What a bummer to see this weak, little scraper. Disappointed is how I feel."
2,Would not buy this junk again,Cheap flimsy handle. The metal blade doesen't scrape very well. Overall I prefer a beer can or and expired TGI Friday gift card over this ice scraper. This thing is a piece of junk.
5,Best Ice Scraper EVER!,This is my second winter with this little scrapper and I'm so glad I bought one! Cleans the ice off better than any other scraper I've had and doesn't scratch the windows. I love this thing!
1,The worst computer programming book I've ever read,"I've been so unfortunate to buy this book a few weeks before it went out of print.To start with, it is outdated, as it covers Visibroker 3 (not 4) and BOA (not POA).It is very inaccurate: Not only you can find a huge lot of typos (yes, in the source code as well), but also incomplete/swapped figures (e.g. delegation vs. inheritance approach), concepts repeated over and over, entire sections copied and pasted from the quick reference Appendix A.It is also pathetically organised: The authors alternate in a masquerade of inconsistent examples, there are continuous and irritating forward references, and several acronym used without being introduced or a glossary.Take a look at this line of code, as an example to explain ""Any""s:theAnyServer.the_any(theAny);I just don't understand how could 15 buyers have rated this book a ""five stars"". No wonder it hasn't seen a second edition. Save your money."
3,Good but you need JBuilder3,"This book give a good explanation about the most famous ORB in the world, Visibroker. The short problem is that the writers don't explain how we have to integrate with a useful IDE. If you plain to buy this book, get Jbuilder first and enjoy it with Visibroker."
3,several omissions,"I was rather unimpressed with this skimpy text. It quickly skims over many aspects of our digital society. Without having the space to adequately address these. For example, no mention of the rise of blogging. Though this was already common in 2003, when the book was published. The biggest omission is of search engines. Google was already popular in 2003. But even aside from that, other search engines had already been widely used by the late 90s, like Yahoo or Altavista. It was recognised that they played a vital part in enabling access to the Web's riches.The index is sloppily put together. It lists Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, who is described in the book. But it omits Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the Web. Though Berners-Lee is in fact also mentioned in the narrative. While the crucial ""browser"" inexplicably does not have its own entry in the index. Instead, it is put under the World Wide Web item."
1,patchouli plant,"Plant arrived quickly, but was very small. It immediately started dropping leaves. Of the other 3 plants oredered at the same time one was small amd spindly and one is now dead (one week later) I live in Sarasota FL and the weather is not a factor. I followed instructions and watered right away and did not over water patchouli. Am contacting grower for refund. Seller refunded my $$ immediately :-)))"
5,Simply delighted,"Shipment was fast, plant arrived healthy and with care instructions. Price is very reasonable ($7.99). Patchouli smells wonderful and I look forward to growing my plant the enjoying the aroma."
5,Love it,I have had it for about two weeks and put it by a window and repotted it and it is doing great. I live in the North East and didn't think it would do so well in the winter..........
3,Heart-wrenching,"I have not read the Karen Kingsbury book, but I will say the actors in this movie were very authentic and extremely convincing in their roles -- so from that standpoint, this is an excellent movie. HOWEVER, the topic was absolutely heart-wrenching... just so, so heavy... my husband and I both cried. I don't know that I would recommend it to a friend -- and definitely not to a friend who has adopted children or is considering it! It would have been a more redeeming movie if one or both of the couples, in their time of desperation and despair, turned their lives over to the Lord..."
4,Not For Toddlers,"We received this stroller as a gift from Grandma who always goes over the top. But my daughter is just past 2 years and is very frustrated by the various seat belts. She calls out for help every fifteen seconds which makes me HATE this stroller. Also, the handle is quite high (a plus for most of the reviewers but in our case a real problem) and for that reason it's very hard to push. Just know your audience; it's very well made, and it's clear that all of their money went into its construction. I love the fact that there are three places for the dolls or toys to be part of the action and the basket is good sized as well. Since she's already seen it, and wants it, we have decided to buy a smaller and very light weight stroller for her that is more geared to a 34"" child, and she can grow into this one."
2,Unremarkable,"I am Jane Austen fan. I also enjoy the humor in novels by Georgette Heyer and Dorothy Sayer. I had high hopes for this one, but I found it dull and slow going. I did finish it, but have no desire to explore other works by the author."
5,Vocabulary and story to please!,"There is not one complaint to be found in this book, or author. I recently picked up ""An Accomplished Woman"" and read it and felt such joy at finding an intelligent romance written similar to the style of Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer. I quickly picked up another, ""Indiscretion"" and devoured it. The vocabulary used in the book challenges me to type in the word at my computer to get the definition. I find her word choice perfect and varied throughout her book. In fact, I find it hard to find those special words used more than once, to my chagrin as I have a hard time remembering a new word unless challenged with it often enough. If you read her books, you will find complete satisfaction!"
4,"A ""best sellers"" of administrative law","This is a complete and remarkable book about administrative law, in which the study of administrative procedure is preponderant, especially from the perspective of the cases."
1,Night Watch - bad movie,"If you didn't read the book, don't even think of watching the movie. It doesn't make any sense. Actually it doesn't make any sense even if you read the book. It's just a pretty bad movie with pretty bad actors."
4,Fitz Shows Up,"Interesting style and premise for a Doctor Who story, involving what amounts to an insane asylum in 1960s London, but then things get a little bit creepy and it all goes horribly wrong, just like in a Who story. Sam doesn't fit in here, as she insists, but then she gets heavily involved in the story, and the Doctor must save her.Fitz is introduced here as the son of one of the patients, and he also gets to play a role in the proceedings before becoming a long-term companion for the Eighth Doctor in the rest of these books. His introduction here is not too great, though he does try his best to stand out from the rest of the crowd, and he does succeed in making some head-way. He will become even more memorable in the future."
2,Not easy to use with Windows 7,"Not what it sounded like advertised, you have to turn a number of drivers off, and still don't work well in Windows 7, thought about returning it, but hoping in time ADS can come up with better driver, and work with MS to make it more users friendly, specially for the price."
1,Picture NOT what I received,"Picture not what I received. It will someday do what I wanted it to do, but I'll have to put a lot more equipment with it. It absolutely was not what I read about and thought I ordered."
3,"Works great, until you get to Vista or Win7","Loved this and it worked great...until we upgraded to Vista and Win7. It simply does not work with those operating systems, the program will not even open."
1,Vista Problems - Doesn't Work For Me,"Won't work. Maybe it's Vista, maybe not. I have a brand new machine with killer specs, so it's not a tech problem, other than Vista. Weird error messages don't make sense. Says the driver is out of date which is weird since I JUST BOUGHT IT. Don't buy it."
3,Ads works great,The capture device works great and the Ulead video editor works well alsoThe biggest problem is the lack of documentation. It is basically trial and error.
3,Product OK Support sucks,The product works okay for what you pay. But be advised if you run Vista you must download all new drivers and files before you try to install or it will freeze and crash your system. Go to ADS web site to get downloads. The online or phone support is at best horrible. There are some issues with syncing video and audio but hey for $80 what do you expect. The seller on the other hand is responsive and will address your problems in a timely manner. Overall I give the product 3 stars.
1,never works!!!,"bought this device and regret it!...cd driver never work, first i thought it was my driver, so i went i bought another similar thing from radioshack and its been working flawlessly (including the cd driver with arcsoft software also). have been called and send email....the phone call of course useless...never recieved reply, the email have 2 responses and the 2nd response is..."" I do not quite understand your question""!!. my question was so simple.....make this device to work!!!"
2,failure to produce,"The DVD Xpress DX2 was very simple to install but the provided software failed to run properly. After loading the software, connecting the box, and 15 minutes into transferring old memories from VCR to my hard drive, I was thrilled. Then an error code popped up, the program shut down and now it will not restart. I've requested assistance from ADS Tech Support but as of yet, no response. The concept is good, execution is poor. I would not recommend this product until they work the bugs out."
3,Inadequate software support,"I have not been successful in my attempts to copy, edit and transfer movies from my VCR to a DVD. The primary problem is inadequate instructions for Ulead VideoStudio 9 bundled with DVDXpressDX2. I have not received a reply to a query sent to Ulead VideoStudio 9."
1,Still trying,"Although a month and a spindle of disks have been trashed, I don't have it working yet. I've just sent it back to ADS for repair. Seems that it starts okay in direct tape to disk but freezes on a video frame while the counter and audio continue working. At that time, the green capture light of the DX2 stops flashing and becomes steady and the DVD recorder stops burning. A program upgrade was installed, but the problem continued. Several calls to ADS Tech, when I could get them on the phone, offered the upgrade and blamed the problem on memory, but my 512 RAM had nothing else running except Norton Internet Security. So it went back for whatever ADS/Tech5 can find wrong with it. I haven't given up hope, yet!"
3,Eh..,"First of all, the product does what it says it does. The DVDXpress DX2 captures analog video in real time with decent quality. The downsides though are many. For one,the support for Vista is non-existent outside of a beta driver from last year that is unstable at best. The device is only compatible with the bundled software (CapWiz) which sucks compared to more popular and Windows bundled software packages. After a 1/5 success rate within Vista, I ended up dual booting with XP to effectly use the product. Under XP, the device works as promised but why should I have to go through this trouble when all computers sold retail today are pre-installed with Vista. How do you not support the standard? For this I rate this product a most generous 3 out of 5."
1,doesn't work,"I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to computers. But I haven't been able to get this to work. Seems to me from reading the reviews that it's 50/50 that'll it work for you. I recommend you try something else. I'm totally frustrated with this. Their website is no help whatsoever. After two days and 10-15 hours of effort, I'm giving up.UPDATE. I called the helpline and explained the situation...they immediately told me I should return the unit...so I got a new unit and it works. Apparently their quality control can't be that good...I still stick by the statement that it's 50/50 that this will work...but now that I have a unit that works, I like it. It's not the total solution, but I can do what I need to...mostly...one meaningful drawback, there's a filesize limit that cuts off the recording after about 75 minutes. I'm hoping I can find a way to increase the filesize."
3,Adstech DVDXpress DX2,Pros- Good quality product and good results capturing VHS to HDD.Cons- $20 cheaper at Walmart. NOT Vista Ready. Took weeks of tinkering to get the Vista Beta Drivers to work. Bundlesd Ulead video editing software won't run on Vista.
2,Wouldn't work on my computer,"The hook up and downloading the software was very simple. There was a error problem with the drivers. My computer is fairly new with windows xp. I called there support and was told to try it on another computer. I install it on my neighbors computer and the same happened. I sent it back to Amazon and credit my account, and bought an other brand. Amazon is so great about handling returns."
1,Avoid this product,"I purchased this quite a while ago and was able to use it for a short time on an XP based system. When it did work, I would say it was ""ok"" at best. Verry buggy and would crash. I have been unable to get it to work on Vista or Windows 7. Software support is horrible and software is extremely unreliable. I am looking for another product to use and recycling this junk. Too bad, I had high hopes."
1,Product not working for me.,"I am certain that people have purchased this product & are enjoying it without problems. But I am not one of them. I can not evaluate it because none of the software will install properly. I have tried a number of times but although it installs properly, I still get an error about driver problems. The extra software included continues to freeze up & eventually crashes my system. Since I am running Windows 7, I did not expect this to happen."
1,DON'T EVEN BOTHER,"I purchaed this item with the hopes that I could follow the extra instructions to make it work with my Windows Vista. I followed all their instructions to the tee and it still doesn't work. I'm shipping it back right away after spending nearly a day trying to get it to work. And, when you call their tech support unit - forget it! They sound like it's an effort to answer or help you."
1,Software causes computer to lock-up,The software that comes with this Video Converter causes my computer to lock-up! This has happened several times now. I was going to return the infernal thing but discovered that the seller has an 18% restocking fee on returns! Beware of making ANY purchase through Amazon before you check the 3rd party sellers' policies.
1,Don't buy if you have VISTA,"Drivers on disk don't work with VISTA. Drivers on ADS website for VISTA don't work. Don't buy this unless you are running XP. Some people have reported that it works on their VISTA machine, but don't take that chance. At least one person got his DVD driver wiped out, so he couldn't reinstall VISTA or its drivers from the drive because the driver for it was hosed!"
4,Surprisingly easy,"This product works as advertised. I was able to copy vhs tapes from very old tape which did not work with older conversion units. It appears to copy purchased tapes as well. The software that comes with it is OK, though I like Sonic mydvd better."
1,Poor quality and DivX problems...returned unit,"I was very excited about this unit when I ordered it, but the pixelation was very bad due to the variable bit rate (VBR) encoding, and the DivX recording feature didn't actually work most of the time. (A blank screen or a green screen was the result.) Unfortunately, given these problems, I returned the unit. I think I'm going to look at an older ADS unit without the VBR feature to ensure quality, and then do any DivX transfers by software. It seems that the fewer variables involved may make for a higher quality image. Too bad...this one really had a lot of potential."
1,Do not buy this company's products,"Would strongly recommend against supporting ADS Tech with your business. I had the misfortune of buying the precedessor to this product (the Video Xpress) a couple years back, and upon my upgrade to Vista the product stopped working. Contacting their Tech Support (which was very good actually -- responsive), they quite politely told me that my product was not and would not ever be supported with Vista and that I could buy their new product. Yeah, right. Never had a vendor just completely back away from supporting their products and customers like these guys. Have older things than this that work fine with Vista because I bought those things from reputable companies that stand behind what they sell.Buyer beware with ADStech -- support isn't there; go elsewhere for your video capture needs, or else you will get to buy their garbage again next year when they stop supporting what you just bought!"
1,"Needs drivers, I think; doesn't work with Win7","I got this product to convert some home videos to DVD. Does not work with Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP. I tried to download from the company's website and there was nothing and no help from customer service.Maybe they're going to put out some newer drivers, for Win7 for example, but until then, stay away from this item.Don't buy a product where there is zero customer service."
1,Worst Thing in today's world,"This product is of such poor standards in today's world, it appeared I was trying to make a 1980's computer work. I tried installing on 4 different machines with different operating systems and none of them worked."
1,NO VISTA DRIVER! - Stay away company doesn't support,"When I bought this product I did so on the basis of a Vista beta driver posted on their website - dated 5/2007. Incredibly, 4 months have passed since I purchased and the same non-functional beta driver is still the only thing posted. Install this driver and the product will not install every time.I have emailed the company with no satisfactory response. If you ever intend to go beyond XP avoid this company at all cost. Their other products too because they still list this product as current yet do not support it. A very bad sign for the integrity of a company.AVOID BEWARE AVOID BEWARE AVOID BEWARE AVOID BEWARE AVOID BEWARE AVOID BEWARE AVOID BEWARE AVOID BEWARE AVOID BEWARE AVOID BEWARE"
1,Do Not Buy If You Have Windows Vista,"This device was made for Windows XP and I have Windows Vista. Initially when I tried to set it up and convert my videos, when I clicked ""Record"", my computer automatically shut down, and did this repeatedly everytime I tried to start over. So I called up AdTech's support center and the guy told me that he would have to email me instructions to download some sort of program that would make it work with Vista. Well, their downloads do not come with a ""Driver Device"" for Vista which you need. As it turns out, AdTech has these downloads that allegdely make the device work with Vista, but they don't have a download for a Vista compatible ""Driver Device"", and they don't know when they will have one........So the whole thing is pointless. So now I'm going to have to return this item since it is completely uncompatible with Vista and find something else."
1,WORKS ONLY WITH WINDOWS XP!!!,"This is a great VHS to DVD recorder providing you still run Windows XP. On windows XP it is flawless. Since I upgraded to Windows 7 it is 100% incompatible. I tried ever tweak I could to get it to work, and it just won't. So now when I want to use this I have to drag my old machine out, which is a pain in the you know what.DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU PLAN TO RUN IT ON WINDOWS XP!!"
3,ADS Tech DVD XPress DX2,"The hardware is functionally acceptable having the virtue of being powered only by the USB port. The limitations of the product, and why I only gave it three stars, come on the software side and all of this applies only to the XP version of the software. First, the maximum capture rate is 4mb/sec. The version of the capture software provided with two previous ADS capture devices, the ADS Instant DVD 2.0 and the ADS DVD Express, captures all the way up to 10 mb/sec. Second, the editing software is limited and unsatisfying - even for a novice. The worst one is ArcSoft Showbiz. When you render a file it uses uncompressed audio - which makes for enormous files (a one hour video won't fit on a standard DVD). Finally, the Vista drivers work but the Vista version of the capture software is junk. It loaded but produced a file that crashed every video editor I tried to use to open it with."
1,Works well when it works,"The ADS Tech DVDXpress DX2 Video Converter worked well for about 4 months and then stopped. The company's tech support said to use Window's System Restore to go back to when DVDExpress and Capwiz worked. So, as long as you don't want windows fixes or any new software DVDExpress will work fine."
2,"Direct transfer or VHS to DVD, no audio, none.","I wasted several DVD's trying to create a DVD by direct transfer from VHS tape to DVD. No audio gets transferred. The worst part of this is that there's no Customer Support. I have a question in to ADS Support site, a response was added once with no solution, and was closed. I re-opened the question, but no response has been made since then. I bought this product late January and it's end of May and unable to use this product for the purpose I bought for. I am very disappointed."
1,Just Doesn't work period,"The Tech support for this product is poor.I was told unplug this, unplug that, now plug it back in and your PC is not compatable.Well if thats so then I tried this on 7 PCs with no successful recordings' and I also had others try it too with no success.Sometimes it would get video and sound only to be incomplete later program stops or has so many bugs it can't complete.If you are in the market for a video conversion tool like this I do not Recomend ADS Tech devices.I was never offered by ADS a exchang or a newer model and never got a refund either due to it being so long trying to get it to work.Good Luck if you do buy one."
4,Mental training for improved performance is important,In the book are some practical exercises that help you think about how you perceive yourself as a person and as an athlete. It is a subtle way of making you aware of the importance of training your mental ability and improve your performance as an athlete.
5,WeatherTech is the only way to go,"I have had several vehicles and I use WeatherTech in all of them. I have tried the cheaper brands, don't bother... Just buy WeatherTech."
2,Christmas gift,"Not quite what we expected. Did not work as intended, but that could be because my son is a heavy sleeper!"
3,Nice and simple to use.,But if I sleep behind the back of my fiancee I have too much shadow to wake up. It needs to be right at your face.
2,It works the first night then....,"The clock works the first night, but after that it doesn't seem to do the trick. I wake up at 5am on the weekdays and I seem to be too tired to even notice the light coming on. I still wake up to the sound of the beep. Try it if you want but I don't think it's worth all that money."
2,"Boring, Disappointing, Just OK","Hey... I bought this hoping to see interviews with Jerry Garcia, and other prominent and famous people yet was disappointed when such footage was not in the film.From the description it seems like such content is on the dvd but no it is not.Interesting people are on for seconds, and I only felt an emotion to this film maybe once or twice.The whole film is about ""what do I do with my life, yada, yada""... meanwhile!...!..... the guy who made this film- the main dude in the movie- is makin money off the film. So thanks man, make money off the people (who bought your movie) who really need direction in their life.And also, thanks for having such a decieving description of your film, on the back of the DVD and on the product description on amazon."
4,Inspirational,"This documentary is inspirational and funny at the same time. It encourages you to just ask for help whenever needed. At worst, you can be ignored, at best you will receive the help you asked for - and more."
5,Well worth the extra cash -,"Any Dream Theater fan will want to own this import. It improves upon the European releases with an extra track - the Home radio edit - which is very nice to have, plus better liner notes and photos in the cd package. It also comes housed in an actual jewel box, not the thin kind where the cd goes in face down.As far as the quality of the music, if you are a DT fan, you already know. If not, then you need to prepare to be amazed, moved, and totally blown away.Enjoy!"
3,Save your money...,"As a big DT fan, I've got to steer you toward better recordings if you are interested in the content of this CD. This CD was released prior to the ""Live Scenes from New York"" CD and DVD, and I was hungry to hear the live versions contained on this disc. Unfortunately, James LaBrie's strained and tired voice nearly destroys an otherwise desireable recording. I find myself cringing as he drifts out of tune and simply misses the notes during the peak of 'Home'. I don't understand why the band chose to publish this recording because it is certainly not representative of their collective talents. Go buy the full live set on ""Live Scenes.."" instead - you'll be glad that you did."
4,Through My Eyes,This Cd is worth getting just for the two live tracks of Home and the melody of stuff from When Day and Dream Unite and Images and words. The radio edit mix is hardly any different than the cd cut. The only difference is the woman is not humming at the beginning of the radio edit. Hope this helps you all out there.
3,TOO SHORT - BUT GOOD ENOUGH !!!!!,"THIS ONLY HAS 5 SONG'S ON IT.IT IS PRETTY MUCH A SAMPLER!BUT IT DOES BRING BACK SOME GOOD MEMORIES OF THE HIGH~SCHOOL YEARS!AND YOU WILL NEVER SEE THESE SONG'S ON MTV OR VH1 EVER AGAIN.SO FOR THAT REASON ALONE THAT IS THE REASON TO PICK THIS UP.AND I KNOW EVERY ONE WHO IS A FAN OF R&B;/HIP-HOP LOVES THESE SONG'S.OR AT LEAST DID BACK 10+ YEARS AGO.AND THESE SONG'S & VIDEO'S WERE GROUND BREAKING AT THE TIME.AND WERE PLAYED A 100 TIMES A DAY ON MTV.SO RELIVE SOME OLD MEMORIES AND PUT THIS IN YOUR DVD PLAYER.THAT IS HOOKED UP TO YOUR T.V.AS WELL AS YOUR STEREO AND TURN THE ""VOLUME ON MAX"".AND JUST REMEMBER AS LONG AS THE MUSIC PLAYS THE MEMORIES WILL NEVER FADE! {TONY~TONI~TON`E}-[NEW YORK,NEW YORK]"
4,"Title of book - Chickamaugs (The Civil War Battle Series, Book 7).","It was an interesting book, but not a ""can't put it down"" one. I would give it four stars out of 5."
4,Needed addition - good stuff,"Just about anything by the White Stripes is worth it and this short CD is no different. The rendition of ""Fell in Love with a Girl"" is, as you would expect, raw and edgy. The other two songs (B-sides from a Japanese release I think) are the same. This small group showcases the Stripes energy and experimental freedom. A need addition to any fan's library."
3,Why?,"After reading lots of other underground building books I find myself asking, why build with tires? Anyhow, if your interested in underground building you might as well check this technique out. There is lots of interesting, and useful information inside, but the book could have used a lot more photos, especially colour ones. You will also learn about a new style of living in tune with the earth."
4,Informative but could have used more/better pictures.,"This book was informative, and it pretty much gave me all the information I wanted to know about how to build an earthship, but the pictures it uses is mostly hand drawn which still leaves a lot to your imagination. I wanted to see color pictures or at least real life black/white pictures that show me different layouts, designs, and other options for building one. Keep the hand drawn ones but add more that show off the idea. Also it seems that for me to even build one requires a lot of money and a lot of paper work with the state. It was a great book but in my mind it didn't make the possibility of me ever owning one for an affordable price any more realistic. I love the idea though."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY.........THEY DON'T WORK!!,"After reading reviews I purchased this product. Like other reviewers noted, mine were NOT terra cotta colored, but are white and came with limited instructions which I followed. The plants were not watered. I did more research and found a video on U Tube with instructions on use. Followed those instructions which were more detailed than the minimal instructions that came with the product. The waterers still don't work. This was a total waste of money, save yours......................DON'T buy these!!!!"
3,Worked but Not very well for small plants,"I had a total of 5 barbjewels tubes in 3 different pots ending in a depth of about 1"". The very small plants died after a month despite a friend coming in and refilling the water containers. The larger but still small plants didOk, after 5 weeks away, probably because their larger root system reached to where the tubes supplied water.So the tubes had some effect but did not distribute the water widely."
5,Easy watering system,"I have used these self watering probes for years and feel they are the best way to deliver the water needed for my plants. They are also great when you are away for any length of time because you know your plants will always get just the right amount of water. The probes do not deliver more than the plant needs. If it's a larger plant, I use four probes to make sure the plant is well hydrated."
1,not as advertised,"I just received these, and they are not as advertised. The product write up specifically says ""Made in Austria. Careful, there are Made in China knockoffs on the market. Rittenhouse carries the real Made in Austria version."" What arrives? A product clearly labeled ""made in China"". They are white, not the terra cotta color pictured. I really need something right away and so will try them, but this feels like bait and switch!"
1,Do not buy this item,"Just got my package. First off they do not look like the photo at all. The packaging looks worn. And there are no instructions.For the price, I would have expected more. Wishing I had choosen the less expensive Hydro probes."
2,the five pack is two three pack minus one probe!,"I bought what was supposed to be TWO five packs (shipping was expensive)--received TWO three packs, with one three pack cut open and one probe removed and paper stuffed in its place. The items probably work fine, but ended up being more costly than same item for another source that advertised a THREE pack. I have ordered more from the other source because 1 2/3 packs is not enough for me and I am not paying the shipping from this source for their mistake."
2,Poor Instructions,"I followed the directions, and it overwatered. I asked for some help on their website, (contact us) but it was ignored."
2,Packaging was old and damaged,"Did not come with any instructions. Emailed the vendor twice asking for some. PayPal says it is beyond their control. Bought for a gift, but cannot give without instructions."
1,Dsappointment,"After setting all five of my watering probes up before my two week vacation, I was incredibly disppointed to arrive back at home and see all of my planters with dead or dying flowers in them. Many of the reviews said these were great items and I was super excited and hopeful that my flowers would stay alive while I was away."
1,They did not work!!,I went on vacation for around two weeks so I purchased these self watering probes so my plants will not die. I followed all the instructions such as pre-soaking the probes and filling them with water. I also made sure that the probe was higher than the tube that was receiving the water. When I came back mostly all the plants soil was dry and one of my plants almost died. Luckily I put water into the plants and they revived. I ended up returning this product because it doesn't work. You get what you paid for! I think next time I will consider the Claber 8053 Oasis 4-Programs/20 Plants Garden Automatic Drip Watering System which is $71 but it is probably worth it. Lets see!
5,Works as advertised,I was a little skeptical about this product but it performed wonderfully over the Christmas break. 5 stakes were enough to water a small herb garden I have at my desk at work for 10+days without issue.
1,LIES,the description said the item are made in austria. but when i got the package it said the on the back of it MADE IN CHINA. ! FAKE FAKE false ADVERTISEMENT. I paid more than other item just the get the same crap
2,A litte disappointed,"The 5 probes arrived in a plastic bag (like a ziploc). It looked like someone returned them without the packaging. One probe was broken on arrival, one probe leaks too much water into the plant. The other 3 are working fine so far. It's a good concept but the probe is poor quality."
2,not satisfactory,"I used the probes for 2 plants while I was out of town. The water tubes didn't stay in the water properly. One plant completely dried out, the other plant had some moisture, but not as much as it needed."
2,white and orange,"product not as pictured or described. the ceramic is white, the plastic top is bright orange. I would like the pictures to represent the products for sale."
4,Works well,"I purchased 1 pack of 5 probes. They work very well so far. I am using them to water my plants I am over-wintering in the greenhouse. I just put a couple of buckets of water about the floor and dropped the ends of the tubes in. I have to refill or top off the buckets every so often.Overall, I recommend the probes, they seem to do the trick."
1,very disappointed,"Going to Europe for 2 and 1/2 weeks and have tried twice now as a practice run. Each and every time, the plants are over-watered. I have spent the last hour or more cleaning up all the water that has overflowed from the plants. Complete Mess and Complete Waste of Money! Instructions were not included in the package -- so I went to you tube to see how to set them up. This is the biggest piece of crap that I have ever purchased from Amazon."
5,planat watering probes,I bought several of these two years ago and put them on my plants. I'm away from these plants for a month at time...I just feed them with a 3 gallon container that my local McDonalds hamburger place gave me. French fry oil comes in these. I haven't lost a plant from lack of water since. They work great!
1,Terrible Product. One star is too many.,"Followed the directions to the letter. Did not work at all. Tried to use it when I left on a business trip, and came back to dead plants. It didn't transfer water even a little bit. Soil was bone dry around the probes."
4,Self Watering Probes work very well.,I was a bit skeptical when first prepping the probes wondering how the syphon would ever get started. The instructions are limited. I was surprised on how well the water was drawn up into the plant. I started out with a bowl of water but shifted to a large canning jar to provide a weeks worth of watering. Only problem I found was that you need to weight the end of the tub or it will float to the top of the water container. Overall this system meets my needs.
3,Too much salt !,"I found these chips to be too salty. The chips arrived fresh, no broken chips, thin and crispy, 12 nice sized bags . I could not tell to much about the barbecue flavor, I was too busy wiping away the excess salt. If they could find a way to make these barbecue potato chips, with %30 less salt, it would be a good potatoe chip."
2,Can you say SLOW!!!,"This book is very slow and to tell you the truth it did not have much going on. The part I hated about this book was when the chapter was devoted to the women and all they did was speculate in their minds. Very boring. ""If I do this then this will happen but if I ask him I will make out better..."". That sort of thing. Very boring."
2,Beware of 'Objectionable' Content,"Overall, Bray's trilogy develops slowly with decent characterization and action sequences. However, for me, by the time I reached the torture scene that included graphic homosexual rape, I knew this was no kind of 'fantasy' I was interested in exposing myself to.I am of a mind that authors can write what they want to and publishers can publish what they want to. I am also of a mind that readers can read what they want to. The content of this book became so repulsive to me, that it took away any desire for me to read these books.Some have written well of the books, and so perspective buyers should consider their opinions. If the kind of content mentioned above offends you, though, I recommend you pass these books by."
4,A good start to the story of Josian,"Josian is a monk and a lighthouse keeper on a remote island who has no reason to doubt his past till an assassin tries to kill him and he responds with deadly skills he knows he never learnt. Forced to leave the only home he has Josian finds there is more to his past than he ever suspected.This is a good opening instalment to this trilogy. Josian is a likeable, if somewhat conflicted and tortured character. This book is a good introduction to Josian and his world but by the end of the novel you have the clear feeling that this is only a starting point and the main act is yet to come.My only reservation with this series is how it will end given the very poorly written 3rd novel in the Devlin series by this same author, but based on this book I'm willing to give this a series a chance to prove itself better overall than the last one."
3,I'm not quite sure on this one...,"I finished this book, so there's an extra star for that, but I'm not quite sure if I'll pick up the sequel. I like the author's writing, but I'm just not sold on this story. In the beginning of the book there was definitely enough to intrigue me - evident in the fact that I stuck with it to the end - but once the climax hit I was pretty much done with it. I don't know who to like here. I connected with two of the prominent characters, but then everything shifts quite abruptly and my ties to them were lost. I will admit that I am curios to see how this ""Chronicles of 'Josan'"" will play out, but my indifference to the story line is winning out. Maybe I'll check out the sequel at the library. But until then I'll be filling my time with other stories."
2,"Solid, but it doesn't sing.","The First Betrayal is not a bad fantasy novel. Patricia Bray does a nice job with her characters and plot. For me, however, the characters never transcended the solid writing to resonate emotionally. The plot, which starts out as an interesting mystery, never lives up to its early potential. I can't decide whether to pick up the next book in the series or not."
3,It was okay,"As one person mentioned, the plot is multilayered. I liked that I couldn't predict the ending. Complex plots like this book feel more realistic, which I like.However, I gave this book three stars because I have no interest in reading a sequel.I felt that the characters were 2-dimensional and under-developed. When introducing characters, rather than showing or describing the character's character (for lack of a better word), the author described the locations and circumstances of the character. A description like that doesn't tell me WHO the character is. It only gives me a snapshot of the character in one moment. Then when he's out of those circumstances, I don't know what to expect.I like realistic characters - characters like people. And people are more or less predictable, once you know them well. I never got to that point in this book.However, my concern over characters was my only complaint. A reader who doesn't care about that one point will probably really enjoy this book."
4,SRAM Attack Trigger Shifters,"Living in Arizona and riding hard on my mountain bikes, I have a tendency to crash now and again. Needless to say, I break parts on my bike. Last couple of crashes took out my shifters. My buddy has SRAM and he told me he really liked them. I bought them and I concur. I now have three bikes with the SRAM Attack Trigger Shifters on them. So far they have been bullet proof.Pros: Works with Shimano, front and rear derailleurs.Value and cost effective.Very easy to install.Mounts nice under my Shimano brake leversCons: Had to train myself to use them. Rear derailleur triggers are different than Shimano. I still catch myself up shifting when I want to down shift and vice versa. Argh!Overall I recommend, but I kind of wish I would have stepped up the SRAM line a bit more and got their better shifters. For what I paid and how I ride, I really enjoy these."
1,poor information overall,not instructive shows overly complex moves and questionable knife usage a disappointing tome
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"While this book is a good general overview of unarmed combat techniques, it lacks specificity and the illustrated techniques can be learned in any credible martial arts dojo. The author's credibility is also questionable, as the U.S. Army Combatives School at Fort Benning, Georgia does not teach any of what he espouses here. Also,his claims of having been the chief instructor for the U.S. Army and for the 2d Infantry Division and 8th Army in the ROK and other areas is not what I remember nor do any of my service compatriots. What is in the book is not what Special Operators or infantrymen are taught. While Mr. Holifield may be an accomplished fighter by his own account,the book raises many doubts as to the usefulness of its content.I would recommend it to beginners only as a reference."
2,An inferior Hand-to-Hand Combat Manual,"This is simply a poor book. The moves are, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, overly complex. The moves borrow too heavily from jiu-jutso, which seems to be endemic among the Army's hand-to-hand combat program. A much bettter book on the subject of Close-Quarters Battle is ""CLOSE COMBAT"" by USMC; the Marines' system is much more simple and pragmatic. Their book is also almost half the price of this nonsense and 10 times as detailed.Though the book was definetly a waste of money t does have, however, a good psychological ops section and some good techniques for the reversal/counter to punches.Other good books besides ""CLOSE COMBAT"" regarding HtH include ""Get Tough"" by Capt. Fairbairn and ""Commando Fighting Techniques"" by Jim Wilson and Paul Evans, all availible through Amazon."
2,limited practical use,"The grappling section of this book is extremely poor, so are throws and the failing techniques. The fighting techniques are basic hard style karate. The pistol disarms, if actually used would likely end with the death of the hostage. The only thing I liked were the rifle techniques and even then they were used on an unarmed opponent. Save your $ and go see an instructor."
3,"a fair book, but lacks depth","This book contains hundreds of well photographed techniques, some of which may be practical for the real world. However the author does not talk at all about the psychological aspect of combat, gives too little input on training and conditioning or the applications of the techniques that he demonstrates. the book is just a collection of pictures with short phrases written beside them."
2,Damp stupid movie,I bought this DVD mainly because of the 2 - 3 mins naked scene of lucy liu and also the good reviews given by the previous owners. Damp stupid story line and a stupid kidnapper having shot and also knife in his head but running around not dead.
4,INTERESTING !!!!,"Yes,it borrows the crossed stories structure from Pulp Fiction,so what ? The technique made history and many films have used it without harm whatsoever to their plots/stories.Plus,you get to see Lucy Liu at her sweetest and youngest,with some nudity and sexual scenes.If you?re a fan of this hot asian chick,you?ll go nuts about this movie (I did)."
4,Fun!,"Like most people, I've bought this movie because of one or two appealing things it contains. Watching it, though, was a nice surprise. There was lots of scenes where I coundn't stop laughing! Of course, those appealing things were there too but, in the end, the whole was worth much more than that."
4,fine trash from the troma team!,"As far as low-brow entertainment goes, it's hard to beat a Troma team video. This is a fictionalized account of the Manson family's murders back in the 70's of some affluent California residents (actress Sharon Tate, pregnant at the time, was one of them). Okay, not a great spoof premise, but the video is creepy and funny at the same time. Some cool nudity and nifty jabs at the establishment."
4,Solid overview of Enterprise Java.,This book boasts a solid overview of the major Enterprise Java technologies. Those wanting more specific coverage of a cerain technology should refer to another book; as this title simply dedicates a couple of chapters to each key technology. But those looking for a solid base in each of the major technologies should find this book helpful.
1,Developing Java Enterprise Applications,This books tells you a lot of nothing. First 12 chapter does not even gets into EJB. The example code does not work unless you have some experience to debug them first. I would not recommend this book to any one accept someone new to java wanting to learn the new buzz words.
2,The price for this book is expensive for outdated coverage.,"The authors try to give some good coverage of Java enterprise applications but they examples are as old as ""java.awt.swing.*"" classes.Need to debug the examples to make them run on on Java 2 platform. The emphasis is also on printing debugging statements. (An additional debugger class for most of the examples).It is time authors updated the contents of the book or reduced the price."
2,Good book but very outdated,"The content presented in the book is very impressive but the examples are so outdated that this book is useful for ""Theory of Enterprise applications"".The price for this book is simply outrageous for the outdated examples (oops! minus theory)"
3,poor writing,"For the most part, I agree with the other reviews here. I just want to add something I'm suprised others left out - the author is no writer! Sometimes you have to read a sentence several times to understand what it really means, and even then some guessing is usually involved."
5,Better than I expected!,I was so pleased with the silver Menorah I bought from Sabrina Silver a year or so ago I thought I would check out their Star of David. It was even better than I anticipated. The picture doesn't do it justice. The cut of the silver really makes it shine. Just the right size and a great price! I will likely buy more for gifts.
5,pretty yet not distracting,"This star of david is perfect. The cuts make it pretty, yet it is not so fancy that it is distracting. The chain is a good length. I have had this for a little over a year. I frequently receive compliments on it and I wore it when I went to the Kotel in Jerusalem this summer (my first trip to Israel/Kotel)."
2,"Good, but no Nurnberger.","These sausages are very good, but they are not the Nurnberger style I had when I lived in Nurnberg and ate many many times at the schnellimbiss stands. This version is much larger and more of a regular, off white brat. My search continues..."
1,laughable!,"I have to say I had my hopes up when I bought this book, but this book is non realistic, who has time to explore their bodies, for hours on end. It wasn't disgusting in anyway but the terms she uses for body parts some times I could not stop laughing! Rose buds, petals, love bud I mean come on who uses terms like that? I certainly don't and never will!!!!! Good Luck to the next person who reads this book!"
1,Lowlife,"Poorly written & executed Highlife. Trite writing, cheesy over-the-top artificial-sounding production, uninspiring percussion. If you are highlife saavy, this album will displease you greatly and you will likely be forced to destroy it. Instead I highly recommend:""Electric Highlife"", ""Classic Highlife"", ""Sankofa"" by The Highlife All-Stars, or ""Heavy on the Highlife"" by the Oriental Brothers!"
4,"Good Value, But Must Upgrade the Video","It's a good deal. It would have been impossible to build a system with similar specs for the money. The wireless KB/Mouse works very well. The keyboard is excessively noisy though.That said, there are a few other problems. The integrated Video is very, very weak. But that's OK. I realized that as I ordered it and ordered an PNY nVidia 7900 GS 256 MB PCI-E card at the same time. Once installed and decent speakers and monitor are attached it's a really good gaming rig.Vista. Ughh. Not ready for prime time. Looking forward to Service Packs One and Two. Quite quickly Vista stopped autoplaying CD/DVD media and had to be restored. Microsoft has yet to release an Autoplay repair tool for Vista.The usual OEM bloatware comes pre-installed. Get rid of it is my advice."
5,Sweet Machine,"Could be better if it had another Lightscribe DVD SuperMulti Drive/CD writer.Most certainly enough power for most folk, and a real pleasure to use. It is unfortunate that HP needs to add all that extra stuff (ebay, experian, Vonage, Easy Internet).But nothing is perfect. I believe I got the best buy through AMAZON"
1,Save your money and use it for a Nutribase or Netzer book,"The publication has very basic information. My advice is to apply the purchase price to ""The Nutribase Guide to Sodium, Calories, and Fat in your food"" or a similar type book authored by Corrine Netzer. Either provides the basic information contained in this publication plus many more listings."
1,Guide to the sodium content of your food,"The original cost for the book is $1.75. You are being ripped off if you buy it. I purchased one from Bookmans, 5120 S. Julian Drive, Tucson, AZ 85706. I paid over $17 but that also included postage."
4,"It's good, but sometimes you have to look around 4 features","The previous poster was wrong, you can delete files, but only one at a time, and it's a process that takes a few steps for each file.I find Contribute to be a good program, and easy to use. the WYSIWYG is not the greatest, and I find myself constantly adjusting margins because it has it's own way of doing things.One of the coolest things about it is the ablility to transform office documents into flash paper, you have to see it to believe it, it's that cool.Not a perfect program, but great for the application in which I am using it for, which is maintaining and updating a website that was built off of a template. I don't have to worry about messing up the design of the page, just the content"
2,Little clear information,"Odd little book. It consists of two not-very-informative short biography sections on Moina Michael (one by Michael and one by another writer), as well as a selection of speeches, poems, and official documents related to World War and/or the poppy as a symbol.Only of interest if you're desperate for more information on Michael and the development of the poppy as a European/North American symbol and charity tool. The most intriguing bit is that it sounds like the idea may have been developed in parallel by Michael and by Madame Guerin, a Frenchwoman--and it looks like Michael went to pains to establish that she developed it first. I suspect she was bending the truth."
3,"Quality, but not quantity","I got what I needed, but it would be a lot better if I could order a pack of maybe 10 or more of these, rather than individuals only."
5,Thomas McMullin is the premier American Urban Historian,"I had Proffesor McMullin at UMass-Boston and he was incredible. There is probably no human out there with more knowledge of American Urban History. I read this book at the library after taking his course and was blown away. It is an engaging and consise guide to the Governers of the American Territories. We got Scoundrels, Heroes, the Author of Ben Hur, and Brigham Young! BDATG is like 17 great books. The writing style, much like the teaching style of Professor McMullin is exciting and informative. This man is a Great American Historian."
2,XTR8CK Bad reception,I have had this unit for 5 days now and I am already having trouble with it. I have tried every frequency possible on the unit itself to see if I can get static free music but it just doesnt seem to work. I get full reception from the sirius satellite but the output FM frequecy on the radio seems to be defective. All frequecies that I have tried have static on it. I am not sure if I can connect the radio directly to my car stereo but this seems to be the only alternative at this point.I would not recommend buying this unit.
3,Sirius XACT radio,"The receiver/radio seems to work OK in my car. I've had it for about a week. However, forget about it in the house. You need an extension (cost $39) for the antenna which you'll then put on the roof and wire it into the house. Seems to work fine - except I plugged it in today and the power cord blow! Called Xact and they are out of stock! Could be weeks to get a new cord. Howard - this is getting very difficult!"
1,antenna,i was never told that the antenna was not included..really disappointed...what am I going to do with the radio with no antenna
2,This is my second one,"I liked the features of the player, but the power plug in became loose it was always cutting off and jiggling it a little seemed to work, then after some time I could not use it at all.I mainly ordered a second one only because the car mount was super glued to my car dash. That is mainly because the sticky pad was useless (as is with any other thing like that on my weird car dash shape). The player itself is OK, though watch the cables and how you handle them. Also, I am sure the channel 1 preset button, right over the power plug in, being mashed all of the time didn't help. It used to be for Stern, which was always getting mashed.I'd definitely get another player if you are new and shopping around. I only got this unit because it was in a bundled package at costco a few years ago. It is not very well made, and there are lots of other options out there now."
1,Dead In Two Weeks...,"This thing appealed to me because of it's small size and easy price tag. Simple yet effective. Then the trouble started. The first thing I noticed was just how hot this thing runs. It would literally burn your hands. The signal was great but two weeks later when I tried to turn it on, it would simply turn itself off and on again. Over and over. Suddenly, it's was just worthless. I should have come here first and read the other reviews because Xact is just putting out a cheap product.Take care,Thomas"
1,Xact should be avoided!,"Unless you plan to buy an external FM relay switch that plugs directly into your car stereo's antenna jack, the XTR8 is useless. I've owned 2 of these now, the first was purchased Dec of '05 and it died in 11 months due to the power plug in the unit failing. The original worked wonderfully in my car with clear FM modulation and even covered my entire house! My new replacement (covered under warranty) which is mounted 2"" from the car stereo produces pure static and is completely unacceptable. The FCC has mandated that these companies cut their FM output power.A quick note about Xact's warranty return process. If you buy the car kit and one day your unit malfunctions (which is likely), Xact will ask you to return EVERY component of the kit or they will charge you for each replacement item. Yes that means you would need to rip the antenna out of your car or they will charge you for a new one! Look at the other stereo brands, AVOID XACT!!!"
4,African American Folklore with the classic Hurston Flavor,"These legends, folk tales, poems, and short stories, spendidly told, created and rewritten by Hurston, beautifully illustrate the pathos, passion and pleasure of the African American existence."
1,Don't buy from this seller!,"I ordered Tripp-Lite cables, and they swapped them out and sent GT Max cables instead without my authorization. The GT Max cables do not work for my situation.Did I order GT Max cables? No.Did I get GT Max cables? Yes.Beware, this seller employs false advertising!"
5,Gamelan music for prog rock lovers,"I like to consider this type of music as the symphonic rock equivalent of Balinese gamelan. While the size of the ensemble (about 30 players) reminds of a classical orchestra, the energetic, virtuosic yet melodic playing is not unlike those found in progressive rock compositions. Hard to believe that a group this large could show a very tight playing, especially when the music is so full of sudden start/stop with frequent changes of tempo. On top of that, the harsh-vs-mellow contrasts that often appear in the same piece make the music so explosive yet beautiful and mystical at the same time. Fans of prog rockers, such as Yes, King Crimson and Thinking Plague, would enjoy this CD."
3,Good,"This book is good. Very informative... but can be quite ""dry"" reading. I bought it to use for review for the IBCLC exam. While it's good it's not my favorite. I like Jan Riordan's book better because of her writing style."
3,Could have been better,"A good concept, but the text is clear as mud. Why is it so difficult a thing for writers to write lucidly and clearly? This book is filled with so much jargon and overdone text that if you don't have the stamia you will fall asleep after 5 pages. I understood Hobbes better my first time around more than this. Remember Hobbes???"
3,Independence Day needs a little help,"I just had to have this game since i own a copy of the video, yes video, and realized the credits mentioned that the there was a video game availailable. For the price, under 10 bucks, i gave it a try. This game loaded on an XP system with no technical problems. Once my son started to play though, it dawned on me that my expectations were a little high. The graphics weren't as good as i thought they would be. But, perhaps looking back, they would be ok for its age. Then again, there are other 90's games that look better (Monstor Trucks). I rate this game a 2/12 or so stars for its lack of visual graphics. I gave it a good rating because it loaded into my XP system. Its just fun to have in our collection."
4,came as expected,gave as a gift & came on time for the boy's bday. durable balls with no unexpected issues.
3,Lower quality than the original balls,"I bought the extra Playhut Magic Balls for my grandson to go with his new Playhut. The extra balls were made of a thinner, lighter, plastic. When they arrived most of the balls were smashed in, not round like the original balls. They will ""do"" but I will not buy anymore. You might want to try other brands."
2,Not like the originals playhut balls...poor quality,"Extremely disappointed in these balls. We were recently given a Playhut ball pit with some balls and wanted to order extra balls for our son. I knowingly payed 10 dollars extra over another brand on Amazon simply because I figured the Playhut balls we have now are very sturdy so it's better to stick with the same brand. Well, I was wrong. These new balls don't even have the ""Playhut"" name stamped on them like the original balls do, they are made of a much thinner plastic and collapse easily. I am so disappointed in the quality, I am debating sending them back and ordering the cheaper balls I saw. I mean....if they are gonna be crappy and thin anyway, might as well pay less right? The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because my son loves the ball pit itself."
4,Great product but check quantity,"These balls are always a hit. At least I hope they will be when my daughter gets to open them this weekend. Anyways I wanna state that you need to check to make sure you get the right amount of balls in the box. I ordered one box of 100 balls I got one box of 96. There were 20 red, 16 green, 20 blue, 20 purple, and 20 yellow. I called and reported that I was missing the 4 green balls; and the operator said that they would ship me out a new set of 100 balls free of charge and that they would be here the following day. Sure enough the next day I received the other set of balls and now this set has 102. ok fine with me, I received 20 green, 22 purple, 20 red, 20 yellow, and 20 blue. Now to decide how to get the 2nd set mailed back."
4,Playhut Magic Balls 100 Pack,"These are great balls. Seem durable enough. My one-year-old son plays in his ball pit with these balls everyday. 100 seemed like it would be enough to fill a ball pit, but I would suggest buying at least two. One package does not go very far. But, good product. Would recommend."
4,Beautiful,I was thrilled when I received these beautiful kitty cat earrings. They arrived promptly and were well packaged. The only concern I have is that over time they have started to tarnish. I'm not sure if it's because they've gotten wet or what has happened but on the backside the metal is starting to change color. The front still remains as beautiful as ever and I guess that's the part that counts the most.
4,just what it says,Just what the item says. Clearly Charming. These earrings were cute and small and i could keep them in overnight which was one of the main things i was looking for.
2,Packaging is inadequate,Initially I ordered 6 plant caddies when they arrived 4 of the 6 had broken wheels. There was no padding of any kind in the box and the caddies were not secured to the box so they were able to bang against each other in transit. Amazon covered the postage when I returned the broken caddies. I ordered 4 more to replace those thinking that the packaging problem was a fluke and the next shipment would be adequately cushioned. Wrong! The next order was the same but this time only one was broken. I sent it back again and and the last order arrived in one piece despite the fact that there was no padding. It helped that only one caddy was in the box.The caddies look very nice and work quite well for large plants.
4,Pretty good,"This is a heavy iron plant caddy with wheels that turn pretty freely. The wheels have some rough spots on them - looks like mold imperfections - so if you are using this stand with a heavy plant or on hardwood floors you might want to take a file to the rough spots to keep from marring your floors when you roll it around. Otherwise it's a great item that can hold a fairly large/heavy plant with no problems. It arrived in good condition despite the less than desirable packaging - it was not packed very well and I fear that if I had purchased more than one they would have damaged each other in transit. But all in all, a good experience."
4,I liked it,"The movie was alwrite, but it was weird how two very young people got married. And also how they managed to get out of all that troble."
4,"""The Moment of a Lifetime""","Being a fan of Saved by the Bell obsessively forever. I could totally relate to everyone on the show. I just liked Zack, Slater was cool, and Screech was the bomb! The girls were fabulous. Jessie was my favorite because she was so smart. Kelly was alright, but she was a little dense. I did admire her relationship with Zack though. Oh, Oh! But Ms. Turtle was the BOMB!!! In Junior high school, I acted just like her. I wanted to be her! Take a cool school, add six attractive teenagers with killer clothes and you have magic! How's that for a self-conscious, but smart young man. The show helped me learn alot about myself, I incorporated many of my thoughts, actions and talents from the students of ""good 'ol Bayside High."""
1,It really stinks,"Isn't it rather odd how two well-to-do young adults who had been grounded in the yuppie work ethic decided to forsake college for marriage? Somebody should have told them they cannot afford everything they are accustomed to without the right kind of funding.And while we are on the subject of bizzare occurences, why is the title date listed as 1989 if the college series obviously was not produced until much later? Some food for thought before blindly proclaiming it the best (or even one of the best) teen dramas."
4,"Artificial, but Jovial","This TV show is rather artificial, as teens and collegiates are not too much like this, but it is a nice show anyway. The movie shows Zach and Kelly, both 19, getting married and all the trouble they go through to get married. The story is fairly lame, but it is a nice conclusion to the show's incredibly long run."
3,"Interesting, but deceptively packaged","Nothing on the cover of this book or in the publisher's blurb indicates anything other than that it is a non-fiction biography. As another reviewer has noted, this is NOT a work of non-fiction, but rather something that should be categorized as historical fiction and clearly marked on the cover with something like ""A NOVEL."" Once I got over the frustration of this bait-and-switch, I enjoyed the portrait, but shame on the publisher for giving it such an academic title."
2,Good start,Although might be a good start to get to know Zoroaster but is very superficial and might have a opposite effect on believers of the doctrine.
2,Great mini-series - but don't buy this version!!,"Framed is one of Timothy Dalton's best pieces of work. But this version has been cut to shreds. The original is four hours long. With this DVD, half the film is missing and it was not padding they cut. If you can find the full version, then great, buy it. Just don't purchase the two hour version."
3,Try to get hold of the uncut version,"Why the studio would decide to release this version is beyond my understanding. I bought this version by mistake several months ago while looking for the full version. I purchased one full-length version from ebay not long ago at a very good price and am very happy to own it (the UK 3,5 hours VHS PAL full version is deleted and you can only hope to buy it secondhand). It is as one reviewer said 'a mind boggling' thriller and lots of cuts were made that are important to the plot.Three stars for this version, because it has been cut to shreds. The uncut version deserves its full five stars. 3,5 hours of film as opposed to the 2 hours cut version, you can imagine missing a lot of suspense!Additional note on September 21st 2009: The R2 uncut DVD version is available."
2,Where is the rest?!,I am a fan of Timothy Dalton and was elated to see this movie being released for I have both a copy off of A&E tv anda copy of the orginial via a good friend but when I played this I was simply heartbroken!! DVD's can hold so much more so why did they release such a version? The plot is very hard to follow and the movie doesn't flow like it did in the full version! If you can somehow obtain this version from British TV or the A&E copy by all means go for that and see what you are missing!
3,Cutting Room Floor,"yes, this version has been cut, cut a lot! I don't know how I would react to this version if I weren't so familiar with the original. I miss the missing footage. It added texture to a work that is now little more than plot. Why do this on DVD? and to a character driven film? The original is more than twice as long as this version.I long for the original."
4,Framed,"Being a big Timothy Dalton fan, especially from his role as James Bond I decided to give you the true feeling about some of his other credits. Here wee discuss 'Framed' which I think is one of his better works. Why? Because it has a very good plot, good supporting cast and a good twist to keep you guessing what is about to come next!Tim's character was well written and it seems he put a lot of thought into picking this role, something he tends to lack in other choices!Timothy West puts in an excellent performance as ever and the two work well against each other, if you were hesitating about whether to pick this film, don't hesitate any more it's worth getting!!"
5,Great pedal for the price,"I wanted a pedal to get a good rockabilly slap back echo (Setzer) and this does it! This pedal sounds great. It is much warmer than most digital pedals and just has great tone. It simulates tape echo quite well however if you want the true tape echo sound, get a tape echo. For gigging and budget minded musicians this thing is great. I have even found the longer delay settings to work great for Pink Floyd and U2 songs. Keep in mind if you want a nice boutique pedal then go buy one but for $150 this is a steal and a great pedal."
1,Ain't nothing like the reel thing...,"Hmm... I play pedal steel, and I usually use an Echoplex to get some slap back and a few other tricks. I have a show coming up, where I am going to have to fly cross-country. So, I figured I get a Reel Echo, and leave the old `plex at home. When I first saw the unit, I was impressed that they designed it to resemble the sliding tape head instead of a knob for the length of the delay. Needless to say, it's just not the same. Doesn't have the right feel at all. And you can't get that great feedback loop either. Now I will admit, for the sound on sound function, it's perfect. But I've never needed to use that on my Echoplex. I will say that it is a good delay pedal, but if you want the sound of a real tape delay, the Reel Echo is not it."
1,Not what is advertised,"Since my first edition O'Reilly ""camel books"" on Perl were a bit dated, I decided to take a chance on what *seemed* like a more comprehensive book on Perl. If you are buying this book based on the number of pages, expecting a ton of information and lots of code examples, save your money. The size is totaly deceptive. The book has large print, lots of whitespace and many repetitions used as filler. Of what little actual content there is, most of it is ""chatty"" and lacking substance. The disorganization of this book makes the Perl language structure and syntax seem elegant by comparison. The only thing good about buying this book was buying it from Amazon so I can leave this scathing review, hopefully saving some other poor sod from buying it. Get the O'Reilly Book, Programming Perl instead!"
2,"excellent book, useless CD","The books is excellent.The CD has extensive unreadable (blacked-out). I have not been able to contact Coriolis through email, telephone, or theirweb site.I would have the given the book a 5, but, because of the CD,I give it 2."
1,If your looking for a helpful book -- skip this one,"I purchased this book amongst others to help me with learning and using perl. Any question I had to look up in this book, the answers were useless. There's sample code but generally little or no explanation of the code. The pieces of code I tried to copy into my scripts didn't work. I found a book CGI 101 much smaller but much more useful."
1,just pretty pictures,I was disappointed - thought it had ideas of more things to make...but great pictures -
5,"Ms. Knight pours forth history, advice, and humor.","I have spent happy hours curled up with this book, leafing through the pages, planning parties and sipping tea. One can read for little known facts or recipes as easily as straight forward tea information. Ms. Knight's book is well researched and informative, but at the same time, it is creative and practical. She has a keen sense of humor which is reflected in her writing and in her ideas. The illustrations in Tea With Friends are charming. In our antipodal world, I have enjoyed adapting her calendar's teas for ours; wintery July and summery January have just the right tea . I look forward to the very great pleasure of this talented author's next work."
2,"Recipes, please!","Easy to be taken in by the outstanding text design and well-wrought illustrations, it is, however, a book that one buys as a gift or to leave out for guests to see and appreciate as part of the lovely decor of the type of home it fits into. If, however, you want to actually make the overwhelming majority of the food listed in the menus in each section of the book, this publication quickly disappoints. Recipes, with food names obviously taken from other recipe books or menus, sound great, but of the five or six listed, only one dish listed typically is followed by an actual recipe. There are far better, if less-lavish, books with ideas and actual recipes for food to accompany tea."
4,Eat gravel,"Michael Gira's Angels of Light is essentially a collection of very masculine lullabyes. Generally the songs contain the hypnosis that was utilized in his earlier swans albums but the sonic scale and the attention to detail, both lyrically and structurally has been evolved. What does that mean? I don't know. But I like to think of evil cowboys alone on the prairie at night when I listen to this."
1,UGH!!!,"This camera drinks battery juice like an alcholic drinks beer. Piece of junk that takes horrible, low-quality photos. Not even worth $50 new. One of the worst digital cameras I have ever used."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I just went through TWO of these cameras--so many problems with the first one, HP finally sent me another. Also, problems with the memory cards (I've gone through three of those; again, HP sent me 1). Anyway, once, with a card full of photos, that I'm ready to print at Wal-Mart, the camera says "" Unsupported card"", another time the photo center machine says ""No images found"", and for awhile, no pictures taken with a flash would work. HP Customer Service said that was ""not a problem"", because I could still take pictures. MANY EMAILS LATER, (from me), I received a new camera (""refurbished replacement""), and after several more emails, a new memory card. Now it happens again, as I am printing photos of my children to send with Christmas cards, including photos of my daughter's 2nd birthday. Next time, I will buy a Kodak camera. VERY, Very dissapointed with HP, although I did get one helpful person in customer service."
1,Do not waste your time and money on this product.,"This camera was a gift. After using it for three months, the LCD screen became unreadable and the pictures stored in the memory disk were pixelated to the point of abstract art. I do not recommend buying this camera for personal use or anyone else for that matter. Another alternative would be Nikon or Canon brand point and shoot digital cameras. (Not endorsing other products but HP are not known for digital photography, though a admirable attempt at it)."
2,I've had better.,The pros about this cam is that the pictures.. were decent. And the software was pretty cool.But the cons? You could not keep enough batteries around to keep it goin.. and the flash is way too bright.. it even actually effected the pictures.
3,Okay for a cheap older camera,"Good for quick and easy shots at parties and such. It's not a tiny little camera and obviously not pro material, but the quality is reasonable considering the cost and age. At 3MP, it is a good choice for someone who wants snapshots to post online or wants only smaller-size prints. I'm the world's worst about fuzzy pictures and this camera is fast enough to offset my shaky hands.The only real drawback - and it's significant - is that the lens cover slides open too easily. Mine opens inside the camera case. Considering that opening the cover also turns on the camera, that means battery drain as a side effect. Presumably everyone uses rechargeable batteries these days. Even so, I'd recommend keeping the batteries out of the camera until you're ready to use it, or you'll find that you don't have enough power to snap anything."
2,Pretty shabby,"This camera is alright if it's your first one since it's so easy to use but, after a while you notice what a waste of money it is. Like some other people, I got this camera for Christmas and thought it was great! So, after a month when I dropped it and it shattered, I bought the same one. Bad idea. Sometimes the pictures just show up as static or with a green or blueish tone. The flash barely works and it really does eat up the batteries. I never ever used the LCD screen because the batteries would die in about 2 minutes. Also, you can't access the main menu without the LCD and the LCD doesn't work when the batteries are low. I would still use this camera because I really would rather not spend money on a 3rd one in 2 years however, the USB cable broke and I haven't been able to find one I can buy seperately.Tip: For young kids, it's an alright buy because they probably won't know the difference. My 12 year old cousin loves his."
4,Snazzy,"Takes great pictures, but however it is a little bit expensive and it could use some more memory. 4 stars for PhotoSmart."
4,I'm happy with it,"Being as this is my first camera, this review goes out mainly to my fellow teens. Until I bought this thing, I only used disposables, so my thoughts on uqality can be somewhat subjective. I personally love this camera, it works really well. The price is great for teens and well in our reach. The picture quality can be a bit on the bad side sometimes, but you get what you pay for. I really enjoy this camera and reccomend it to whoever is just gettting started into photography."
3,Ok for your most BASIC photography,"I got this digital camera after having my son last year and it has done well for just getting the BASIC 4x6 photos, though if you dont want a flash, thats too bad cause youll never be able to hold still enough to get a non-blurry (ie:good) picture. The red eye was pretty bad too in alot of photos, though the editing software that comes with is OK at taking the redeye out, though sometimes didnt work there either. Ive also had a few problems w/ the software stopping working and having to ""re-load"" it. I am upgrading this year to a different brand and more MP."
3,Cool Camera,This camera is a very sleek camera and works great for the price.Pro's:InexpensiveEasy to useLooksNice sized screenCon's:SUCKS up the BatteriesThe Front slider(which is the On & Off button)This camera is overall a nice camera for the family or the Real Estate Agent but should'nt be used for enlarging.
5,I LoVe It!!,"This camera is great!! I don't see why it gets bad reviews!! You people just must have really, really high-quality taste, like expect it to be god!! This camera has everything!! From black and white pictures, to color recording!! I have printed off several different pics; and they all have came out EXCILLENT!! So, YES!! I would recommend this camera to anyone who has a brain!! This is a great camera, where do you get &quot;-5 stars from??&quot; That is really underexagerating!! You are probably just stuck up!! So, believe me!! This camera is wonderful, and I could, I would give it 10 stars!!"
1,Terrible Pictures.....,"I was extremely disappointed when I took picture's with this camera. The picture's did not come out clear, they were very pixilated, dark, too bright- yellowish, etc. On top of horrible pics, I had this camera for 3 days and went thru 3 sets of AA batteries...it's a battery hog! Do more research before you buy, I wish I did before I waisted my time and $, although I returned it for a wonderful Canon S230...highly recommend!!!"
5,Its Great!!,"This camera is awesome. All of the pictures I take come out crystal clear and It doesn't eat up my batteries. And for that women who got a bad one, oh well you should've traded it in for a correctly working one. Mine is great all of the moments I want to catch with my friends come out awesome. I am very smart and I know for the price this camera is selling for on the internet and in stores, it is better than more expensive camera's dollar cameras. My dad uses mine now. That's all."
2,HP should be ashamed,"I got this little nice camera for a very low price. I was supposed to be happy and eager to used but there is only one word to describe this product: Dissapointment. I started using it and I noticed that you can only get good pictures when you're outside and there's bright sunlight. When you take pictures inside the quality is just awful, and the flash it's not the best in the market. Don't use the Zoom! or your quality will drop to not even 1MP. I don't know really how can this camera be 3.1 MP, it doesn't even get close to that. I have a 1.3 MP Olympus and the picture quality can't be compared. So I would recommend this camera to those only living in desert areas where there's always sunshine and to people who do not take pictures inside, if you match this criteria you'll have a good camera for low price, but if not don't even think about it."
2,So so...,"I bought the camera because it was 'cheap'. I could have got the 635 for the same price, but thought that a 3Megapixel camera w/5times digital zoom must be better than a 2Megapixel with a 3times optical.Less than a week after I bought it I returned it to 'upgrade' to the lesser HP 635.3x optical, 4x digital with more features. Odd. I take better photos with less 'megapixel' than with the higher. Oh well. Live and learn.Batteries are gone in like 20minutes, the screen is slow and choppy, indoor photos are a waste of time.Spend the same money and get the HP 635. You'll be happier. But as an entry level, it's pretty good. You WILL get tired of it fast, took me a whole week."
5,best camera ever,this is a great camera that has a lot of pixels and comes at a low price. it is the best digital camera i have ever owned. i have had 5. this is also cool looking
3,"In this case, you get what you pay for...","If you're looking for a camera with lots of creature features and super clear pics, look elsewhere. This is a basic camera, with the right amount of features for the price. It's a good starter camera, but do not expect to use alkaline batteries with this one. You WILL NEED 2100mah or better AA NiMH rechargeables. It does have decent battery life with a set of those, but for all day shooting, I'd recommend carrying at least an extra pair of these batteries. The software that comes with the camera has good features for a beginner. If you're looking to do professional pix with this camera...FORGET IT. If you want something that will take acceptable pictures for digital storage or email, then this camera will fill the bill. It does decent 640x480 video with audio, with a 256MB SD card, it will give you about 20 minutes (provided your batteries do not run out first)."
4,"come on, it cost $122 folks!","I think the key here is to evaluate your expectations, and this camera meets my expectations and then some. Seems like some of the reviewers on here are scolding hp for creating a camera targeted at the ""snapshot"" crowd. If you bought a $25 Forman grill and expected it to do a pig roast you'd be disapointed too. Look back at the pictures your parents took of you when you were a baby, its likely that the hp435 is a big step up. I like the ease of use, and the superior printing to the digital camera I bought 5 years ago, and the battery drainage is drastically overdraumatized, I got aquainted with the new camera on the included batteries and in future plan to use the rechargables i bought with the camera, because again, I EXPECTED IT TO DO THAT. if you want a magazine cover outcome, keep shopping, but if you want a fun little camera that is surprisingly flexable and has a lot of bang for the buck, you're here."
4,compact affordable with many features,This camera has all the features of the big boys at a fraction of the cost and size.Takes great snopshotsVideo/audio is so-so but still fun to play withWell constructed and has many featuresCan be played back on TV which is a plusI'm really enjoying this camera and have as much fun with it as my brother is with his $800 camera.
2,Don't Drop the Camera,"Whatever you do, do not let this carmera hit the ground!! Dropped it once after only a few weeks of use and I am now the proud owner of a high-tech paperweight -- out-of-warranty repair $85. :(It is also a battery-gobbler! Photo quality is adequate for snapshots."
3,Value its price,"Great for outdoor pictures and travel: fast, light and reliable. Pictures taken with flash at night are not great, and tend to a blue tint, but they are pretty decent, you can fix them with Photoshop. This is not a big deal, since practically all the pictures I take with a canon Powershot G2 always need a fix in Photoshop too.It is quite obvious you can't do professional photography with this camera, but if you have to travel, and don't want to risk an expensive digital equipment, this is a great choice. Buy from the start a couple pair of recharchable batteries, because the life of an alkaline in this camera is a joke."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this from a leading store. The pictures were good and the camera looks beautiful, but it guzzled batteries like there's no tomorrow. I used NiMH rechargables, but within 5 shots, the battery level indicator was at its lowest, and with 8 shots, it had died out! Of course, the software was another issue. It installed all kinds of icons on my desktop. I hate a cluttered desktop, so when I removed the icons, many features of the program just went dead! I returned and got myself a Kodak."
1,So dissapointed!,"Please don't waste your time on this camera. I bought this camera for Christmas and for 2 weeks I took pictures and without a single shot that I liked. Every picture is blurred to some point, some more than others, but all blurred. I'm just so dissapointed.I have returned the camera. It is NOT worth the money! It should be discontinued or recalled it is so bad.I have nothing good to say about it. Worthless."
2,Decent Camera but Disadvantages,"I bought this camera, It would turn off by itself sometimes. I could deal with this but after 4 months I decided to get a new one. I like the image quality was good so that was a advantage. Also the easy to use software was an advantage. It was so so simple to use so i bought the same one the. Big Mistake. I bought it 7 days ago. This one was even worse. the LCD would go white after about 2 minutes of being on. The pictures came out so dark and the Night Mode made pictures that were not even close to the original. I am getting a Sony camera which it suppose to be really good camera."
4,great camera,"I bought the hp 435 as my first digital camera. It is everything I expected and more. the picture quality is fine. I used it on my vacation and the pictures were great. I took over 200 pic on my vacation and have no complaints. It uses batteries fast, but I expected that with a digital camera. I bought two sets of rechargable batteries so I always have a set charged. The camera is very easy to use as is the software. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Not a good camera for those interested in photography.,"I found it hard to believe that the quality of the photos I took with this camera was very poor. It was impossible to get a clear shot of anything. A lot of pictures taken in loer than normal light had a lot of noise. Overall, this camera is very poor quality for the price. I couldn't believe that it didn't have a macro mode. I found that the Fuji FinePix A205 was a MUCH better camera when it came to the price."
1,"ok, but expected better","when i bought this camera i was told it was pretty good...what a joke. it drains the batteries after taking only a few pictures, there is no optical zoom and the digital zoom does nothing for your pictures...they look very pixelated. low quality pictures at night, you cant tell what you're taking pictures of if your not looking through the viewfinder where then you can't use the zoom. it looks like you are looking through night vision goggles. ok pictures during the day, but some color distortion. its an ok camera for someone who doesnt really care about the quality of the pictures and doesnt want to spend too much money. on the upside, it is very easy to use, is very lightweight, and is very stylish, however mine is going right back to the store!"
3,Decent quality,"You get nice pictures at the daytime, though the digital zoom doesn't help much, When you get used to the light adjusting features at night, you can take decent quality pictures. i had problem when using it on cold temperatures because the camera didn't turn on but after several attempts. This could be the major drawback of the camera, but in summary I recommend it for those who don't need an excellent quality on their pictures. The price tells us that."
2,I wouldn't recommend it.,"When I saw the camera, I thought it was too good to be true, and I was right. I thought it was awesome to have a 3.3 MP camera for only around $150. When I got it the first think I noticed was the the LCD screen was choppy. It kind of disappointed me, but I thought maybe it was normal and I continued using it for awhile. The pictures seemed fine on the camera and on the computer, but when I got them developed they came out awful. A lot of them were dark and blurry, only a few came out good. The zoom feature made the pictures blurry too. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this camera."
1,Horrible Product,This camera should be taken off the market. I understand at this price-level you can't expect the quality of a $500 camera but even at $20 this camera would be overpriced. The image quality is very pixalated. I have seen 1 Megapixel cameras that take better pictures than this one. The battery life indicator is always showing batteries that are half drained; even with new batteries. The viewer looks really bad and cannot keep up with any movement. I brought this camera back the next day. I purchased a Kodak 6330 for a few dollars more and am very impressed with it.
3,Not what i expected,"I was expecting big things from this dvd. Lets go to the good points 1st. The Bio is really good. His matches are great for most part. Bad points No entrance music They didnt show Austin flushing Pillman head down loo. Not 1 promo,Wheres the promo from when he reunited Hart Foundation? No footage leading up to his matches This isnt the best dvd out there by wwe. This was a Xmas gift im very dissapointed that wwe didnt put the effort in to it."
3,Rumored matches! Somewhat of a let down considering the Superstar,"vs. Lex Luger, Halloween Havoc 1989 - Good Match, best on that card!vs. Goldust ""Loser wears a Dress"", SummerSlam 1997vs. Jushin Liger, WCW Monday Nitro 9/4/95vs. Steve Austin, Clash of the Champions XXV 11/10/93Hollywood Blondes vs. Ricky Steamboat & Shane Douglas ""Steel-Cage Match for the World Tag-Team Titles, Slamboree 1993vs. Goldust, WWF Ground Zero - Pillman's Last Match RIPhighlights from ECW, Austin & Pillman's Gun incident from RAW, Austin attacks Pillman interview from WWF Superstars and more highlights.The Matches are rumored and are a let down much like the Ultimate Warrior dvd."
3,Another Good but not great WWE DVD set.,"My father was a huge Flying Brian fan. And this set was originally given to him, but once you get past the documentary, the dvd set falls flat. Seems to be a problem with some of the WWE DVD sets released during this time period."
3,Entertaining,"The reviews seem a little harsh. The author puts his heart out and I find it admirable. I did enjoy reading this series. If you are into romantic graphic novels, you can find these issues on the cheap, and they are worth reading on a budget."
1,JUNK,this 3-hole punch broke when trying to punch holes in 4 pages - not 40. First time out. A terrible product. Better to go to staples
3,looks good but....,After umpteen attempts at installing this light it's finally up and it's super cute. Just wish it wasn't such a pain in the rear to put up. Instructions left a lot to be desired and I found myself wishing for an extra hand or two.
2,Poor Quality Ruins a Good Idea,"I was excited to receive this little guitar, as I am traveling for one month. Based on its dimensions and price, this seemed like an ideal travel mate to keep in practice. Sadly, after it arrived its defects were immediately clear. The build quality is poor. I may not be Joe Satriani, but I have been around guitars for more than 25 years. This is the poorest quality guitar I have encountered. Frets that buzzed, dead spots, and constant retuning. Given the limitations with the bridge I wouldn't even attempt to perform an intonation on it. For the money you can easily find a small scale acoustic by Yamaha and others, or for a little more spring for a low end Steinberger. Don't waste your time or money on this."
3,Smell,The guitar sounds ok however it does not stay in tune. The worst part is that the case smells just like gasoline.
4,Fun in a case for very little money,"Quite a lot of fun, this little guy is light and airy and plays as such. The carrying case and extras (strap, picts) make this an easy purchase for someone who would like to take a guitar on little trips. Easy to tune and easy to play right out of the box, but don't expect a big sound. While I'd recommend the electric Traveler guitar for better play and sound for a small travel guitar, you're going to pay triple what this Rover will cost after buying an effects filter and cables and mini-amp.So for cost and purpose, this is a good purchase."
2,Ordered twice 1x Good 2X Not so good,"I ordered this guitar and it came wrapped up nicely, but without the strap. I called and they immediately sent a replacement which came in an old box that had been damaged and taped up and still did not have the strap. I know they had a problem in the past with the straps smelling funny. Maybe someone removed them and never put new one's back in. Also, the 2nd guitars woodwork was not nearly as nice as the 1st, and the case was coming apart in the ""hinge"" area. It was probably a previous return. Returning everything and going to brick-and-mortar store."
4,Excellent Fingerboard,"This is a great guitar for practicing on the road. It has great action, a fretboard comparable to a full-size acoustic guitar and good fit and finish. It's not too loud for a hotel room and the case is light and strong with good storage. I appreciate the backpack straps. The sound, with provided strings, sounds like a blend of banjo and mandolin - definitely not appropriate for jamming. It's easy to play with the strap, but hard to hold without the strap. Speaking of the strap, it has some really noxious chemicals in it. I suggest you throw it away immediately - probably should be treated as hazardous waste. Don't do what I did: I took the strap out of the plastic bag and then stored it back in the case. Next time I opened the case, everything smelled like the strap. I'm airing out the case and instrument as I'm writing this review. I took away one star for the strap, however the guitar and case are surprisingly good."
1,"Forget it if you actually play guitar,","Needed a travel guitar to practice while sitting in hotel rooms on business. I wasn't all that concerned about sound quality. Mainly wanted something that was playable and had a decent neck and string action.Very disapointed. String action was so high I consider this thing completely unplayable. Tried adjusting truss rod and it helped, but still very unplayable.Sound was about what I expected, not going to play a concert with it, but good enough for practice use.Nice case and accessories, and a great idea. But too bad the guitar itself is unusable and unplayable. I'm amazed at the good reviews, so I can only assume that most of these folks are not actual guitar players or have no experiance with anything other than a walmart guitar..Returned and decided to look at other options instead..."
2,"Little Rover, Little Tone","This was an affordable package deal but I wasn't happy with the poor guitar tone.I sent it back and purchased a Samick ""Greg Bennett"" ST62 for $139.00.The Samick isn't as small but has much nicer tone and workmanship."
4,Washburn Travel Guitar,got this for my son for his 15th birthday. He loves it but finds it a bit harder to tune than his full size guitars. Great product for the price!
1,Strap is Hazardous to your Health,"The strap has an industrial glue that has not and will not cure. The result are noxious and dangerous fumes that get in your eyes and lungs. No amount of airing out will change this issue and I was forced to return not one but two guitars to Amazon, as the chemicals permiate the case, guitar and anything else that it comes in contact with.After my complaint Amazon was responsive and even took the product off of their inventory. But now it seems to beback on. Buyer beware, this is a problem in the factory in China, not correctable from the states."
3,Good nice travel guitar - the strap however is incredible...,"The guitar definitely delivers what it promises and is very good quality for the price. I would have given 4 or even 5 stars of rating, if it wasn't for the straps (and the case, I fear): I thought some of the reviews were exaggerations but actually the stink of chemical products is incredible and hard to get rid of.... it is frankly disappointing that Washburn uses that kind of - probaly toxic, certainly disgusting - stuff."
2,I thought I could take the smell,"I thought I could take the smell. I couldn't.Otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding.The case is nice too, but everything smells like the Chinese rubber smell at Harbor Freight Tools. (sulfur?)I tried airing it out for a week with no success.If you have no sense of smell, get one."
3,"Neck heavy, smells of laquer","This washburn guitar does indeed have a great sound and is really compact. However, the neck is really heavy compared to the incredibly light body of the guitar. And when i first opened it, it wreaked of chemical, from the laquer I'm assuming."
3,If you can stand the smell...,"The sound of this little guitar is very good given it's size and the construction looks very good, but the smell of it could make you pass out! I don't know if it's the glue, varnish, or foam in the case, but it WILL make you ill if you're around it for more than a few minutes. The case is much worse that the guitar but I've put both out in the garage to ""air out"". If it's not better in a week, it will be going back."
4,"Great book, save for a few omissions","Ah yes, the start of the GI Joe craze. The comics are far better than the TV series ever was. The interesting thing about the first ten issues of GI Joe is that, except for the 2-part Oktober Guard intro, they are all single-issue stories, most of which impact very little on the rest of the series.I liked having them in a single volume, but I do not like the fact that the back-up story in issue 1, nor the pin-up extras that were in the original somics, are included in this volume. Would it have hurt them to have put those add-ons in the back? That's why I can only give this volume a 4 out of 5."
3,Needs Updating,"This book gives a great overview of the hikes available in Ohio. However, I found this book to be very disappointing. The directions to the trailheads are often unclear and some of the features of the hikes have changed since the book was written (i.e. big trees have gone down). In addition, important information is lacking. For example, the fact that dogs are not allowed on many of the Ohio metro-park trails is not mentioned in the book. I think this book was probably excellent when first published, but times have changed and this book needs to be updated."
1,Not Good,"This video was horrible. I showed it to my class, and we all fell asleep. The woman that narriated it was boring, and the whole thing was put together poorly. I'm hoping to get my money back on this."
1,Soul Food: Classic Cuisine From the Deep South,I don't like this book at all because the recipes are not good at all.
2,NO,"This book was full of food that if you eat on a regular will probable cause heart problems, high blood pressure and high colestoral. Let find a better way to eat black people.We are not slaves any more we have options."
5,Good food and a good read too!,"I've had this cookbook for several years and have referred to it numerous times for a refersher on stuff my grandma used to cook. If you're unfamiliar with southern cooking you'll find the directions easy to follow. If you're pretty comfortable with the style but need suggestions on how to improve a recipe or remember what basic ingredients are needed it's great. Additionally, the book tells the story of this family. My husband, who is from south Georgia, found himself getting homesick and hungry just reading it. Enjoy!"
4,"If you love southern food, you need this cookbook","I purchased this book years ago and recently misplaced it and just ordered another copy. I enjoy the recipes, the short stories... it's good reading and the recipes are very good. Brings back memories from the south."
3,Good book,"This is a good edition to any kitchen. I haven't made alot out of it, but there are plenty of recipes that i needed."
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, I've only been able to find one repeatable recipe in this book - Cousin Beverly's chocolate chip cookies. It is lots of fun to read the narrative and look at the pictures.No one noticed all the flies on the dessert tray goodies? Very unappetizing."
4,Different twist,"Sheila Fergurson's soul food book is different. A former singer with the 70s pop grop, the Three Degrees her food has it's roots in North Carolina. She now lives in England and first published the book there. Each dish is presented with a introduction to her original English readers and the book contains the longest and most thorough description on how to correctly fry chicken I've ever read. Like the great Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine you get an interesting story about Fergurson's family history. It's an interesting little book that nicely presents soul food cooking to Europe."
4,A Keeper,"A good cookbook makes you want to roll up your sleeves and get to it. I found Ms. Ferguson's stories and directions to be entertaining and clear. You can't ask for too much more than that in the kitchen, so I'm keeping this one, too."
5,Great Down Home Style Recipes,"I am a mom of a large family, and I love this cookbook.The recipes are **great**,I also like the stories (and the history of some of the dishes) that come with the recipes.These are Down Home Style recipes that use things we have on hand in our kitchens and pantries.All the recipes I have tried in this book have turned out well, and my family loved them.GREAT Southern Soul Food Cookbook.My Grandma taught me how to cook and some of these remind me of her recipes (of course none were ever wrote down, she knew what to put in them though, and how much). Enjoy!!"
5,Fantastic Cookbook!,"I use this book all the time. The author infuses authentic soul food recipes with tales of her and our rich cultural heritage. From sumptuous buttermilk biscuits to delicious sweet potatoe pie, the recipes are easy to follow. Every recipe I've made in this book has turned out delicious. This is also a great gift for newlyweds."
4,Doing their job,"I have used these to hang light pictures and even a very heavy mirror. They are all holding well. The only downfall is they tend to mark up my picture rail when they are moved around. So make sure you completely remove the hooks to reposition them, don't slide. It could just be my paint, but just so you know."
4,They work as advertised,"I live in a pre-war 1920's building in NYC that has picture rails in several rooms. These hooks allow for the hanging and moving of pictures without having to nail into the plaster (or sheetrock) walls. I use eye hooks and mono-filliment line to hang my pictures and it looks great. I found that some pictures tilted too far forward when hung and after some research learned that if you move the eye hooks on the rear of the frame closer to the top you'll get less forward tilt. Move them down and you'll get more. Overall these work great, no slips, easy to hang and use and generally disappear from sight once hung. Recommended."
5,"First came Homer, then Vergil, then ... Trowbridge!","Golf Made Difficult is epic poetry which, in parts tragic and parts comic, speaks to the non-sensical, unreasonable, and wonderfully passionate golfer inside each of us. Tom Trowbridge deftly rhymes his way through the world of golf clubs, golf lessons, and golf games with the inside knowledge of a man who has spent long hours of unspeakable agony on a golf course for those brief seconds of delicious ecstasy. In this Iliad, we have found the Trojan horse in our golf bag but are having much too much fun to toss it out. This beautifully written and illustrated book will probably not drop your handicap but will surely make you stop crying about it. I would highly recommend it for anyone who loves golfing, and for anyone who loves someone who loves golfing."
4,Great back to back DSL device,This is one of the few DSL devices that work well back to back. I use them to connect offices over short distances < 5km over 'dry pair' or an point to point alarm circuit. There is a small panel on the back of the unit. Set switch 1 to ON for one of the units and they will connect. I can't figure out why this feature is not documented.Great product.
4,Peaceful passionate balinese rythymns from axis mundi,I Nyoman Windha is an excellent gamelan composer who is recognized internationally and performs in the Gamelan Sekar Jaya group. Mickey Hart has put some of his compositions on his most recent release.The rhythms will most certainly help you digest your nasi campur prior to pulling into a big deep barrel at Padang Padang.
1,When a bargain is not a bargain,"I purchased this set thinking they were the Clover brand bamboo knitting needles which I use all the time. The set seemed like a great value, however when they arrived and I saw it was not the brand I was expecting I took a close look at them because as long as they were quality that wouldn't necessarily matter. Upon inspection I could clearly see that these were inferior needles with very rough joins and cables entirely too thick. The construction is very poor and these are not usable for any kind of serious knitting. I returned them and got a credit."
3,Usable,I needed several sizes of circular needles that I could afford and this was some that I could use. They are not as smooth as I would like but they work pretty well. I probably wouldn't purchase them again because the yarn tends to drag.
2,dissapointine,"Not reccommended. Though they were very inexpensive, they still weere not worth the money. very difficult to read the size imprinted on the shaft."
3,Not the best quality for serious knitters,"I needed different sized circular needles for a few Christmas projects I was making, so I ordered these. The needles are fine, but the tubes they attach to them are tight when sliding my stitches. It takes a lot of time out of knitting to push the stitches back up on the needles. The more expensive ones I have are made of smaller diameter and stitches freely slide on and off. These are okay and work, but I will not buy anymore of these sets."
2,"Win some, lose some","Pros: like the bamboo and the assorted sizes, haven't had a problem with the bamboo breaking or splintering.Cons: Many of my needles have broken at the connection point and they cannot be glued together successfully because they just break again. The first time this happened, I wrote to the company asking for a replacement, which they sent me free of charge. The second time, I asked for another replacement and they sent me a whole other complete set, which I didn't need, but I figured if the needles keep breaking I might as well have extras. Now I'm slowly getting metal indestructible ones to replace the ones that keep breaking. I would suggest going for the ones that don't break because you'll save yourself the frustration.(I don't use very small needles in my knitting so I'm not sure how the little ones hold up.)"
4,A nice alternative to a fuzzy top,"My landlord has a fuzzy top, carpet style seat cover on the toilet seat. While comfy to sit on, I think it looks a little ridiculous. I chose this product as an alternative to the fuzzy top. The seat-sock fits well over the seat and the fabric is soft. It's not a thick fabric nor does it have any cushion. So as not to the lose the cushion of the carpet top, I stretched my seat-sock over the existing carpet cover. Now I have comfort with a little more style. My only complaint on the seat-sock is that the the stitching that reinforces the stretch opening of the sock is a very noticable white (my seat-sock is midnight grey). You don't see the seam in the photograph. I would have prefered the seam thread match the color of the sock."
5,Bernstein Did The Best Shostakovich No. 5,"I have heard many recordings of Shostakovich's No. 5.For all of you critics of Bernstein who say that he ruined Shostakovich's No. 5 by playing it too fast, I have one word for you: ...!!! No. 5 sounds so much better with the tempo that Bernstein employed. Some of the recordings of No. 5 are performed so slowly that I have trouble listening to them (particularly on the fourth movement). Bernstein's No. 5 is the one to buy. I have a copy of Bernstein conducting the NYP in Tokyo in the early 80s for a Sony digital recording. I do prefer the sound quality of this recording over this older recording done decades earlier. However, both are worth adding to your collection."
1,Bernstein-Shostakovich,"Since his death, Bernstein's reputation as a conductor has been steadily diminishing (in contrast to his legacy as a public educator and, to a lesser degree, composer). In my opinion, this recording gives an indication of the reason for that. Here we have a technically impeccable performance but absolutely boring in terms of real musical interpretation. If you just want to have a faithful reading of these works that's an adequate recording, but if you want to get a taste of the real emotional power that make them qualify for the title of masterpiece I'd recommend any of N. Jarvi's and K. Kondrashin's interpretations. Specifically for No. 5, Maxim Shostakovich's RCA recording is my absolute favorite."
1,Ridiculous tempos,"This review is confined to Bernstein's performance of the 5th, because I couldn't stand to listen to his performance of the 9th after suffering through the 5th. The recording is muddy, and the tempos are bizarre. His ""moderato"" is ""allegro"" and his ""allegro non troppo"" is ""allegro very troppo."" The last movement is breathlessly fast -- 8:55 where Haitink takes 10:35. Get Haitink instead, although I agree with other reviewers that the first Rostropovich (on DG) is very worthy as well, particularly in capturing the screams underlying the false note of triumph in the last mvoement.By the way, the Hurwitz review seems to indicate that the performance on this disk was recorded in Russia. I think what he means to say is that Bernstein presented this interpretation as part of a TOUR that took place the same year as the recording, but this performance took place in Boston."
3,"Good in quality, typically unusual Bernstein style.","Shostakovich's music (especially the symhonies) is filled with wit and sarchasm, but this recording does not express these aspects. It takes just about all of the music at the kind of brisk pace more appropriate for period performances of pieces like Beethoven's earlier symphonies. One of the things strongly emphasized in this piece is the competition between the lower and higher pitches, and the dynamics of this performance are relatively flat and don't emphasize this. Also, I MUCH prefer the more modern ironic interpretation of the finale, wich is featured in Rostrapovich's recording, among others. Here, Bernstein seems to raise the tempo MUCH faster in the finale in order to force it to be a triumph that it simply is not. I highly recommend Rostropovich's recent recording of this work with the LSO."
2,Disappointing performance of the Fifth,"This performance of the Ninth is very good, but the Fifth is a tremendous disappointment. I agree with other some reviewers that Bernstein destroys the soul of this work by rushing through the Finale.I can't help but get the feeling that this performance has received such rave reviews simply due to nostalgia. It's worth a listen, but it's certainly not a benchmark reading.Rostropovich/National is head-and-shoulders above this performance. Haitink/Concertgebouw is recommended as well."
2,an incorrect interpretation,"The Shostakovich 5th is interpreted incorrectly. The tempos are always way too fast. Bernstein perhaps should have done more research before he conducted this Shostakovich. The ending is misleading. Because of the fast tempo, there lacks sorrow and pain. Buy the Rostropovich recording instead."
2,just buy a new gel seat,"the cover moves around too much, no matter how much i tighten it. just doesn't look cool either. i gave it away and purchaced a new gel seat. looks much better and stable too. the person who i gave it too likes it better then me, but also complains about it moving around. it is still better then her hard bike seat. its just better to spend the cash on a new gel seat, especially if you ride agressively."
4,Works great,Bought these to mount my bicycles in the back of my truck. They hold secure and work great. Even though they offer a location to place a lock all a person needs is a pair of pliers and they could easily get the bikes off. I'd still buy them again just don't advertise them as lockable.
4,great for the price but not as secure as it appears,"I used this to replace the bolt on an old roof rack I use. It does the job very well. I like that it ""appears to lock"" the fork for security, but reality is its not truly locked as all a thief would have to do is turn the nut on the other side. I always use a cable lock to lock it to the rack if I have to leave the bike on the car while at the store anyway. Its very sturdy."
5,Easy to install and easy to use.,"I purchased 3 of these bike locks and attached them to a large wood board instead of drilling them into the bed of my truck. These locks work great and keep bikes secure even while driving on bumpy and windy roads. If you are using multiple locks, I would suggest using a single cable to lock the forks and and front wheels. I will be ordering more once the need arises. Great product!"
4,Great Locking fork mount,A very solid bike mount with hole for pad lock. I put this on a 2 by 12 board in the bed of my truck. Works great.
1,"Amazon is ripping you off with this fork, sending the cheaper model","They say they will send you the ""Delta Bike Hitch Pro 2"", but when it comes in the mail, it's the ""Delta Bike Hitch 'regular'"" model. It looks different than the picture, and doesn't work as well. This has happened three times to me. My business depends on getting this fork, and Amazon can't seem to get it right. The cheaper fork that they send you can be bought for $12 elsewhere, so why pay $16.50 for it here?"
3,No Hardware?,"Great construction, seems to work well but it didn't come with any hardware to attach to my Delta truck rack. Bummer!"
1,Mmm,Didn't have enough pictures. Which is what I bought it for at the time. I think it's somewhere being recylced at this point.
4,Learn to Assess Logic,"This course primarily teaches people how to think about the assumptions, arguments and assessments we make every day. Much more often than we realize, humans automatically use assumptions, analogies and other tools to help us comprehend, communicate about and make decisions regarding ideas and situations. Listening to this course quickly makes one aware of how little we really consider the methods these practices, and how often we fail to reason them through as effectively as we might.Whether you're in business, education or just a citizen trying to cut through the political debates surrounding election issues, this course will help you determine the validity and strength of someone else's arguments and more effectively craft your own. Decidedly worth one's time and effort, this is another great offering from The Teaching Company!"
1,Not at all Practical,"I initially was attracted to this course after studying a course in Philosophy and Logic at my University. In comparison this course was so bloated, theoretical, and obtuse that I got very little from it. I would recommend looking in the actual practice of debate, argumentation, etc.To provide an analogy: Imagine a piano instructor describing the finer points of music, the greats of classical music-its history, evolution, etc. versus an intsructor sitting you down and having you go at it...point is you cannot learn argumentation from listening to this course.I believe the only reason this course got 5 stars is that other listeners haven't had the benefit of a comparison...I am on lesson number 23 as I write this and I cannot wait for it to be over."
5,Wonderful,I would recommend this to anybody that wants their animals to get that added help to get better and they loved the taste.
4,A Great Read,"This book is great. An adult woman accidentally turns herself into a pre-teen superhero. But that doesn't begin to describe what makes this book so charming. Don't get me wrong. There's plenty of superhero action. But what makes Skye work for me is the characters. Marcy is someone I'd like to know personally, both before and after her transformation. And while it would have been easy to surround her with stereotypical characters (the angry boss, the unbelieving FBI agent, the unfeeling politician), Metzger instead gives us real people with real responses to what has happened. So, I'd recommend this one to anyone whose ever wondered what it would be like to fly like Superman. And I hope Skye makes a return appearance real soon."
4,Intersesting Angle,"Skye is a very interesting book. It explores a new angle on the superhero/wish-fulfillment myth, and is about a wish that both gives and takes away. Would you want to become a superhero if the cost was both your identity and your physical maturity?"
3,Grateful Dud,"You can probably get most of the Dead's concert stuff on youtube, which is probably the best thing on here. Tom Snyder is such a square he might as well be speaking another language when trying to grasp Ken Kessey and Jerry Garcia. Still, it is interesting to see the Dead so well behaved, playing short versions of songs acoustically. Probably the ommission of Phil Lesh from the interview sequence (let me guess, he said ""no way"") probably kept it cordial though arguably Bill K. and Mickey H. are about as interesting as a paperweight. I bought this DVD at a store in Haight-Ashbury, I was definately in the moment. My Dead Head buddies will love this rare glimpse when they were still more or less on top of their game."
4,"Classic Snyder, Great Garcia Interview","This is s a great transcription of tape to DVD,IF you are a Tom Snyder and/or Grateful Dead Fan.The interview with Jerry Garcia is just a hoot, and theDead in-studio performances are pretty good also.The remaining Snyder interviews with Tom Wolf and Tim Learyare OK. I always felt that Snyder had the most interesting andintellegent talk show on TV. This is a good example of his interviewing style and format.The quality of the DVD is not the greatest, since the showswere recorded between 1978 and 1982, and just transferred from tape."
2,Ripped off,"The Tom Wolfe interviews have zero to do with the Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, few chuckles and nice tunes from the Dead, Leary acts like a fool. The Dead should be embarassed to be involved with such a misleading product."
5,Good Ole Grateful Dead MUISIC,...doesn't meet up to the book's version in any manner.Synerder's dsicussin with Leahry's version is worthy of colletction
5,One Great Parenting Book!!!!,"Obviously Mamma Bamma did not read Good Parents Bad Parenting. This book was nothing on how she described it. Lisa Dunning offered great support and advice for parents to get on the same page. The book never blamed parents nor did it imply if you did x then you are a bad parent, only the contrary. Good Parents Bad Parenting was a very supportive and well thought out book. There were also a lot of research and support to back up Lisa Dunning's views.I recommend this book to everyone who is a parent-It really helped my realtionship with my husband as well as improved my parenting skills."
4,Enjoyable,"I find the Pennyfoot Hotel series an enjoyable cozy series, and this book is the same. A guest at the hotel appears to die from food poisoning, but Cecily expects something rather more sinister. The mystery in this one is a little simplistic, but I do love the characters and getting to know them more with each new book in the series. These books are a lot of fun to read for anyone who enjoys the cozy genre. But, alas, it appears there are changes on the horizon for at least some of the staff at the Pennyfoot Hotel. I would certainly hate to see the last of Gertie Brown. She is the best character in this series. I look forward to the next book in this interesting and fun series."
4,Fun but a little slow,"This is the first Pennyfoot Hotel book I have read and I will definately read more. The characters are fun, some reminding me of characters in Fawlty Towers, so they seemed like old friends. The mystery is a bit predictable, and the solution rather evident as you get about half way through the book, but there is alot of enjoyment along the way, although it sometimes is a bit disjointed, jumping between characters suddenly. It is a great book if you want something to relax and escape with for awhile."
1,I didn't really like it,"It's a nice cover, as journal covers go, but the inside isn't as good. The pages aren't lined, which makes writing messy and confusing. The headings take up a lot of space, and ruin its purpose as a journal- they limit creativity. I don't think it is worth the money for a journal without lines that tells you what to write."
3,Not the worst Harry Potter tie-in item I've purchased,"One of my daughter's favorite activities at school is journal time. The teacher writes up a topic on the white board and the kids write a short composition based on the topic. I assumed that this book would consist of short topics related to the world of Harry Potter with room to record one's own thoughts below. Well, nearly. The book is nicely printed and bound on good paper. The layout is attractive. Unfortunately, the topics are very sketchy. For example, one page contains ""My best friends,"" underneath is printed ""Ron, Hermione."" Well, duh. In many cases, it will require participation and some imagination on the part of the parent to elaborate on the topic sufficiently to fire the kid's imagination. That notwithstanding, this is not the worst Harry Potter tie-in item I've purchased. I expect my daughter will enjoy it as a stocking stuffer, along with all the other Harry Potter and Eloise related gifts this Christmas."
2,Disappointed...,"I was very disappointed in this product. I had ordered it new and paid extra for Priority Mail. Not only did the journal come in the time it would take for normal shipping, it was already written in! In pen. I had ordered this in hopes that it would bring back childhood memories, but it was really just a waste of money. If this product was marked new, then the person who sold it was lying. It was not new! It was used! You can't sell a journal that's been written in as new! Maybe someone else wants to write in it. Very disappointed."
2,Hugger Mugger Back Massage,"this item is O.K. in that is does what it is supposed to do. It is vastly overpriced, with a substantial amout added to the cost by a cloth carrying back with minimum usefullnes."
2,When Did You Last See Your Father?,"Sorry, folks.I love Colin Firth, but this movie was quite depressing, and his performance was not up to ""Pride and Prejudice"" standards.."
2,Jim Broadbent - Amazing,"I watched this film simply because Jim Broadbent is in it. He is one of those actors who could not give a bad performance in his sleep. Colin Firth is a bit too ""Hugh Grant"" for me, but I was willing to endure him simply for Mr. Broadbent. However, I don't 'get' the film. Supposedly, it is an exploration of a father/son relationship. In the film, Mr. Broadbent's character (the father) has a lifelong affair with another woman, occasionally calls his son 'fat-head' and exposes other human flaws, but other than that appears to be an involved and caring father. It leaves you thinking that Mr. Firth's character (the son) is just a selfish whiner who spent his life alienating himself from his father for no reason. Perhaps the book explored the potholes of their relationship more fully; the film sure doesn't."
1,What a pointless boring movie!,"Where do I start - horrible script, boring acting, moronic ending. 1 star was the lowest I could give it. How Colin Firth has fallen from the P&P days."
2,Not What I Expected,"Santa brought this to my daughter and the sound quality is very poor. She was not really interested in it, i think for her age, she's 3, she needs something bigger. I was not imppressed."
1,Fun for 2 minutes.,"My daughter received this as a Christmas present. After playing with it for two minutes (no kidding) the toy broke. I replaced the batteries but it still didn't work. I wasted my money on this, don't waste yours."
2,XP SP2 requires special treatment,"This card turns out to be compatible with Win XP SP2 only if you limit yourself to installing the drivers. The Netgear utility that comes with it as part of the installer is not compatible with SP2, and causes a blue screen crash. I found this out the hard way! So when Windows prompts you for drivers, browse to the Drivers/XP directory on the CD, and let Windows do the rest. Don't use the installer!"
1,Poor reception,"I have this on a desktop with Win XP. This adapter goes through cycles of good to poor reception repeatedly. It will occasionally drop the connection. Whereas, my 2 laptops placed at the same location receives excellent signal constantly. Go figure."
3,For Vista and 7 make sure you get version 3!!,"Make sure you get the WG311v3 model if you play on using this with Windows 7 or Vista. Netgear actually updated the driver for that model to support it. Even with that said, 64-bit versions of Windows on PCs with 4GB or more of RAM like to throw back an error code 10 with this card. If you're rockin a 32-bit setup, this isn't a bad card."
2,Not worth the 10 bucks,"This is not the router you want if you are looking for a cheap wireless card. The product is what it is but you will probably want a card with a little more ""ooph"" the range is abysmal and throuput is spotty even with line of sight. Spend a few more bux and get a better card"
3,Don't download Service Pack 2 yet !!!!!!!!!,"Product works great on Service Pack 1, but I downloaded updates for XP and SP2 came up so I went ahead and downloaded it. Then I couldn't connect back to the network, regardless of what I did. Did some research and found I wasn't the only one, so I am uninstalling SP2, don't need it anyway with a wgr624 that has a firewall in it anyway. Good luck"
1,very very poor product support,"i had some difficulty getting this to work in the beginning but the product support was helpful in that they got it to work--for NO CHARGE! at least for the first 90 days. occasional dropping of connections for no reason, it has been working fine. Now i can't get connected at all but since it's been more than 90 days since i bought the product, they are asking me to pay--more than the cost of the product! of course, there is free email support which takes more than 24 hours to reply and their suggestions are not that helpful. i haven't been able to get the connection working now more than two weeks!! so, while it works, it's great. after 90 days, count on buying another one as their technical support costs more than the product."
1,"Poor support, unsupported drivers and freezes WIN XP","I purchased the wirless g router and pci card, which all installed fairly easy. I initially (first hour or so) got a constant connection of 54mbs but then the system would freeze after about 5 minutes and I would have to power off and reboot. I tried all the pci slots updated my motherboad's drivers with no luck. I searched Netgear site for support and checked message boards. I found out that a lot of people were having similar problems so I decided to return the card and try Microsoft's pci card. WOW!!!!!! constant 54mbs connection, no pc freeze and no dropped connection."
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought this card since I didn't want to pay the higher price for quality products like linksys and belkin. I purchased two of the cards, one of them is functioning fine. The other card stopped working after a couple months suddenly and for no reason.Their tech support is in India so they are very difficult to understand, and you can expect to spend two hours per phone call trying the same basic troubleshooting techniques over and over. They determined my card was defective and they agreed to send me a new card. However, DHL sent it to the wrong house and it sat outside in the rain for two solid days. The new card doesn't work and as of yet Netgear will not take it back!"
1,Garbage,Bought this for its vista compatibility. It does not work with Vista despite numerous attemptes. Searching for resolutions to this online reveals hundreds of other frustrated purchasers and not a jot of evidence anyone got it to work. Netgear should be ashamed of themselves for this product and the pitiful support they offer.
1,Netgear WG311 54 Mbps Wireless PCI Adapter,The absolute worst product. Stay away!! There have been zero days that i have not had a problem witht this adapter. I get the Windows BSOD EVERYDAY. Went out and bought the Linksys equivalent and have not had any problems thus far.
2,"Cheap product, cheaply made.","My card worked off and on for about 2 weeks. It would lose the connection and sometimes a router reset would help, sometimes it wouldn't. It doesn't support WPA as it is now shipping. Upgrading the drivers to 2.0.0.7 to enable WPA-PSK resulted in my never being able to connect again. I have a dell axim x30 which does not experience these problems, so I'm pretty sure it's the card. I tried to adjust the antenna once, when it was still working, and the whole thing fell off. To be fair, I bought it in the marketplace, so it could have been an expertly repackaged refurb, but even when it was working it only got 50% signal 20 feet from the router, in the absence of interference. It has been suggested that heat may be a problem with these cards, especially under heavy use."
1,Dell does not support this product,"I am having exactly the same issue as some others with a dell dimension and a wg311 Netgear card. I get the same ""NMI: Parity Check / Memory Parity Error"", hardware malfunction blue screen on shutdown. When I remove the card the computer shuts down normally. With the card installed, I always get the blue screen on shut down. This is completely reproducible and consistent.I just got off the phone with Dell technical support and spoke to ""Dhocz"".I was told that Dell Dimension is not compatible with this Netgear card.I don't know what else to say, but I'm P.O.ed. She said to call Dell sales department and they would be happy to sell me a compatible card.If I were Netgear, I'd be a little worried or at least offended since Dell has such a large market share."
2,System freeze with Win XP Home,"This works fine with Windows 98SE but I moved it to a spanking new Windows XP Home machine (P4 2.4GHz etc).The Netgear control panel would often disappear by itself without connecting to the network.This morning, the system froze everytime the Netgear control panel came up. I had to disable the wireless card in order to boot Windows normally."
1,old product,"I expected to get a WG311v3 instead I got a WG311v2. Also, Netgear is not abble to supply a driver for Windows Vista at this point. v3 would have at least a beta driver."
1,Very poor and inconsistent connectivity,"This adapter went into one of four wirelessly networked devices on my home network, and is the only Netgear Adapter on the network, and the ONLY one to have issues, every day, day in, and day out. My office laptop sits right next to this desktop and NEVER drops it's connection, so I know it isn't location (signal is excellent, full 5 bars).Having had good fortunes with Netgear previously, I suspected interferance, too close to metal, etc, but even after adding an external Netgear antenna, my woes of dropped connectivity, and actually overall slow system performance continued.Interestingly, I just installed a Linksys WMP54GS and the system is running better overall and no dropped connectivity. I'm obtaining an OS reported 54Mbps with the full 5 bars.The Netgear card I had was a v2, by the way. It seems this card missed some good quality control and I cannot recommend it. Go with the leader in WLAN technology, Linksys (Cisco). You'll have much better luck."
2,Time Consuming with Dell Demension XP Pro SP2,"Comapring to my other machine which has a different card used to be at the same location, This card gave me weak signal and dropping connections as many folks have mentioned earlier. With XP Pro SP2, this card always caused ""NMI: Parity Check / Memory Parity Error"" blue screen at system shutdown - Dell Demension 3100.I was with a Dell Cust Rep on the phone for 2+ hours this afternoon to go thru all kinds steps to finally identify that this card caused the issue. Here when I did a seach with keywords NMI Netgear shutdown and finally found this forum. I am ""glad"" to see that this card caused same issue with another Dell customer! Wow, lots of people have problem with this card!"
1,WG311v3 WON'T WORK WITH W7 64BIT,"I purchased this adapter several weeks ago for use in a new build. Should have researched it first. The driver for this card will not install correctly. I've used NetGear's and Microsoft's and both fail error code 10. Went to NetGear's website and they are aware of problems with both win7 64bit and using more than 4 gig of memory. They don't offer any solutions. The driver and software they have are the same as on the install disk. Customer support? There is none! (they don't respond). If you are buying an adapter, check the manufacture's website about compatability issues."
1,Does not work with Windows 7 OS,"Despite what it says on the box, this wireless receiver does not work with Windows 7. I spent hours on the phone with a very courteous tech rep in India but was not able resolve the driver compatibility problem. I eventually returned the product to Amazon which, as always, was a simple process. If you read some of the negative reviews for this product you will see that others encountered the same problem."
1,stay away from netgear,"bad xp SP2 compatibility. not sure if it is my AMD chip or SP2 because even the XP update from netgear woulnt help. BSOD's daily needed a restore to get them to stop. buy a linksys, havent had a single problem with them. linksys wmp54g is worth the extra money."
3,Problems with Windows XP SP2,"4 stars for price, -1 star for bad Netgear driver.I downloaded the latest 2.0.0.7 driver which supposedly fixed problems with Windows XP SP2. I could never get the card to work with only the driver installed or with both the driver and configuration utility installed. The Windows XP and Netgear configuration utilities would see my access point, but couldn't connect. I'm running the latest BIOS and drivers for my Asus motherboard.I resorted to using the driver for the US Robotics USR5146, which uses the same chipset."
1,Card was defective VERY poor support dept.,Would rather give it a zero star if they had one. Installed the card with the ver.2 drivers. Card worked for a few hours then started switching on and off about every 30 seconds. After about 5 calls and to tech support over in India and 20 hours of playing around I gave up and bought a Linksys card it works great. Netgear should look at what Linksys does for Tech support. Would never think of buying another Netgear product.
1,forget Netgear; go check out Linksys,"I purchased this adapter instead of the Linksys PCI Adapter because it was cheaper. Big mistake. In addition to having a painfully awkward setup and installation process, it just plain didn't work. When I called Netgear's (outsourced) tech support, they were functionally useless as well. They were unfriendly at best and downright hostile at worst.I can't comment on Linksys's tech support, mostly because I've never needed it. In addition to a wireless router I've purchased from them, the PCI adapter I bought works great. Don't be a skinflint here. Buy a Linksys product now; otherwise, you'll just end up buying one later."
2,Does not work reliably on XP PC,"I have wasted many hours fiddling with this card trying to get it to work on my XP PC. No matter how I configured it, it would intermittently freeze up my PC. Netgear's tech support tried to help but to no avail. Ultimately, I found that the MSI Turbo PCI card [ASIN:B000M5U9GI Super G 802.11BG Wireless Pci 64 Bit Xp Compliant Turbo Mode] works 100% reliably on my XP PC and, ironically, gets a much stronger signal from my Netgear router."
1,Doesn't work with windows 7 64 bit!!,"Tried to install this on my brand new PC. It doesn't work on Windows 7 64 bit, even though it says it has Windows 7 support. Installed the latest software and everything. Found a list of ""known problems"" with the latest software, which included the ever helpful ""may not work on some PC's"". Save your time and money and don't buy this if you have Windows 7. Tech support was worthless. Talked to some guy in India who was more concerned about who my ISP was than my actual problem..."
1,Disappointing,"A little summary of my experiences:1. The software package messes with the login screen on XP. You will no longer be able to use the prettier XP login screen with the users' images.2. The connection is dropped on a regular basis, and not re-connecting until a re-boot.Re-installing the driver, disconnecting other hardware, using it on another computer etc. have not made the slighest difference.I have no comments on the speed of the network connection because I just don't care. If the thing would stay connected for long enough then the speed would be relevant."
1,Low price = Low performance!,"80% of the time this ""thing"" tells me that the signal is poor even though the router is less than 12 feet away and the transfer rate is equal or less than dial-up. Even with it's ""simple to use tool"" software that really serves no purpose since you can't make any real adjustments, it's mostly for flash to make it look higher quality. Every time I start up the PC I get a prompt telling me that there is a critical error and the software needs to be reinstalled or updated (which I have done). I just can't figure out this ""thing's"" problem. It's not worth much so it was no big loss when I replaced it."
1,"Know this, problems for Windows Vista 64","Bought at Best Buy with the recommendation of the sales tech. Box includes a line that says ""works with vista"" brought it home and went through the install process. After having trouble went online and found that most people use an updated driver that is not sold with the card. install updated driver only to get error code (10) more internet research an I found that Windows Vista(64) users with more than 2Gb of ram are sol. returning this morning. will not buy Netgear again. Considering leaving Best Buy as well..."
3,"OK for the price, but has issues","i installed this on a PC i only use for quiescent data backups, BT downloads and the like(speed is not really critical), so i guess i am happy with this thing for the price. i got it becuase i didn't want to run a cable to the router. i run win xp pro sp2.but here are the issues it does in fact have. whether or not they are a problem depends on your application: sitting about 20ft away from the access point, it doesn't show ""excellent"" signal strength (indicates 1 bar less than the max). i am aware of the external factors that can cause this (lot of metal around etc.), but the environment i have it in is pretty clean. connection goes off at times, needs a kick start. the antenna can be better. i haven't upgraded the firmware in a while but other reviewers have said that the new firmware fixes some issues.[...]"
1,Horrible product & customer service,"This wireless card causes my windows xp computer to crash non-stop. Uninstalling the Netgear supplied software solves the crashing problem, but the card can not stay connected to the Netgear router. The two laptops I have stay connected with no problem. Talking to customer service just resulted in additional hours of wasted time.Worse than wasting $40 on this card was the wasted hours of my life. Will not be buying any Netgear products any time in the near future. Apparently tech support must be so cheap, that it was worth wasting hours of everyone's time to avoid replacing an obviously defective product."
1,Not What was advertized,"There is no way this ""man purse"" will hold a cell phone. Geez. What a waste of money."
3,An interesting story,"I read _Essence of Decision_ for a class, and if it hadn't been for that, I probably wouldn't have read all of it. The chapters detailing the Cuban Missile Crisis were interesting, especially the way the authors arranged it, so that the further you read on, the more and more unstable the whole siutuation seems to be.The chapters detailing Alison and Zelikow's ways of looking at the Missile Crisis were interesting, but they did not serve to trap me.For a shcolarly work, it is interesting, though I reccommend picking and choosing the chapters you read."
5,Three models - a classic for students of decision-making,"Graham Allison may not have released that he created a cottage industry in decision making analysis on the back of his three perspectives of one crisis. The research into the Cuban Missile Crisis involving the United States and the Soviet Union over the deployment of short and medium range nuclear missiles to the caribbean island of Cuba is gradually being built upon and overhauled by the opening of archives. However, the three cut approach to explaining and indeed teaching the dynamics of government (and indeed, large organisations) approaches to decision-making is the introductory text to the subject.ESSENCE OF DECISION; EXPLAINING THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS [BY] GRAHAM T..."
2,Text Book,"I'm a bit of a policy wonk at times, and I have a B.S. in Poly Sci. I had to use this book in a graduate class and was bored to tears. Poly sci is never thrilling, but this was especially boring. As a jumble of information it's good enough, but as with most poly sci books, it gets bogged down in irrelevant details and often creates distinctions between terms and ideas where perhaps there really isn't."
1,Kindle edition has too many restrictions,"This book is excellent. Unfortunately I cannot recommend the Kindle edition. It can only be read on 2 devices and I routinely use 3 (Kindle, phone, cloud reader). The publisher wants me buy another copy so I can use the Cloud Reader? It's restrictions like this that make me second guess my Kindle investment. Additionally, this is a book a that cries out to be highlighted yet the publisher has placed serious restrictions on the number of highlights. The Kindle doesn't tell you this until you try to view your notes & highlights and they're not there. I will not purchase another book from this publisher."
4,Cheap but what did you expect.,"The plugs work as it should. I used an RJ-45 crimper to repair 3 plugs in my home network. All plugs have this feature in common. After crimping, the plugs have a tendancy to not click into the RJ-45 port.Simple fix: bend back the top of the plug about 60 degrees. Don't worry it won't break off, unless you bend it over 90 degrees. Once you do that, it should ""click"" into the switch/hub/router.So I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because of this workaround."
2,Use caution when purchasing,"Use caution when ordering, if you don't buy the item from Amazon itself. The vendors selling the ""same"" item for significantly less are likely to just send you a bag of generic jacks, not the nice C2G ones with the load bars. I was able to get a refund from the vendor and I'm probably going to go ahead and use the jacks anyway, but it wasn't what I had hoped to receive."
4,Good exercise while on-the-go,"I like this book. It is not required reading or anything, but it contains unusual endgame positions (some bordering on the bizarre!) and it is fun to work through while on-the-go (or at least that's how I used it). Of course you could set up the positons, but I preferred to go through it in my head to practice my visualization skills.Endgames CAN be tactical, and this book, if anything, is a reminder of that."
4,Good Effort,"This book is good, but not great. It covers many common endgame themes such as zugzwang, and how to draw, etc. There are a few good examples on tactics, but more examples on common endgame themes. This book is more for the advanced begginer/intermediate player."
5,Truth and Transcedence,"In Star Rover Jack London writes with the searing pain of the light within the Sun. The journey is horrific, the reward is truth."
3,good first half,"the first part is really great. the events of a convict's life is presented in an interesting way. the convict finds a means to escape, sort of a meditative way, that makes him fly to far off places. but the story doesn't really develop or continue from there. instead it ends up being a bit boring, although starting promising."
4,"Good content, poor binding","Although barely known, this novel is one of the greatest works of Jack London; the reader will certainly feel trapped by the deep voice of a narrator who reveals the mysteries of other lifes, and life and death themselves, without leaving the four walls of an early 19th century prison. The problem is not the book but the binding which is too tight and makes it very difficult to flip the pages comfortably in order to enjoy the journey."
5,Poignant and hilarious,"I suppose I am now some sort of Lewis Nordan ""groupie."" I first loved ""The Sharpshooter Blues"" and went on to enjoy all the rest including ""Lightning Song."" But, tonight I think that ""Music of the Swamp"" is my favorite. (Or, is it just that I read it today and so it is Nordan's work most fresh on my mind?) Sugar Mecklin is a very special character - but only as special as his family and friends. Sugar has a dad who has worn yellow plastic shoes and lived to talk about it. Read this book and read Lewis Nordan."
5,"Magical, heart-warming and heart draining at the same time.","This is a masterpiece of work, it takes the reader of a young boy and leads you throughout his life, filled with many downs and a lot of very bleak humor. Once you pick it up it will be very hard to put down until the last page is turned."
1,More like discord in the swamps!,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. The language and content was awful! If you are planning on buying it,please, don't. I usually try to stay open-minded about books I read, but this was awful!"
1,"bad, bad, ugly","HP635:1. ""Red eye"" mode does not work at all.2. Does not save options.Amazon:1. I can not return this item.I hate Amazon.com and HP635"
2,"Horrible battery life, good camera otherwise","This camera takes awesome pics for the value, but you will make up for it with all the batteries you will need to purchase! I took this camera to a car show after having it for a couple months and took a 10 pack of batteries with me, I used all 10 batteries up within 2 hours and only took about 80 pictures! True you could get rechargable batteries, but you would still have to carry all of them around with you. I would reccomend finding another camera that is better on batteries, one that you could get away with not carring a small energizer plant in your pockets!"
2,Garbage,"I bought this camera in September and it managed to last a whole 3 months before it broke. I didn't even drop it or anything. The batteries fell out of it while I had it turned on. The lens is stuck out, and now the camera won't turn on or do anything. I've tried numerous different batteries, and tried troubleshooting, nothing works. I contacted HP customer service but they were not much help. Essentially they told me that all they could offer me was to trade it in and pay around $200 for an upgraded camera. No thanks, HP. I think I will try purchasing a camera from a company that doesn't sell junk next time. Also, even when this garbage was working, it zapped battery life like nothing I have ever seen before. Avoid this garbage."
3,Very bad return money,I have ordered this item thinking that this is cheapest price I can get.After I waiting 4-6 days I got the package.But I found that this camara is used one not new. Then I returned back But I got only $88. They have included some stocking fees blah blah....I recomment to buy some good shops like staples or office Max as they dont send used items as amazon.
2,Battery problem a big downer,"If you're having a problem with the battery life, judging on other reviews, you aren't the only one. This camera does work decently when the batteries are working. It takes video with sound in addition to the pics. If you have a HP computer and printer like me, the software loading pics/video is even easier.Here's what I have found is a way around the battery problem:Keep 3 sets of rechargable batteries. (I use rayovac IC3 6 total)The moment you put the batteries in the camera, it starts sucking power whether it is on or not! IF I limit my viewing of pics already taken and take pics without the screen on, the batteries will last about a day (40 pics).Leave the batteries in the camera overnight. By the next morning, the batteries will be dead or close to it. Take the old batteries out, and put new charged ones in while the others charge. The reason why I keep 3 sets is in case I use one up too fast.Hope that works!"
3,Not too shabby; one complaint though..,"I wouldn't call myself a [digital] camera expert. I have a few friends with digicams and this my first one. All the features on this thing are great! Lightweight, practical, and it's not too slow taking pictures or loading them. It's fun to play around with, too. My camera drained AA's like nobody's business; but then I got rechargeable ones. Still, the battery power is a problem-- Enough to make you conscious of how long you leave it on, and how much you use the screen (which drains more power) rather than the oldfashioned viewfinder. Hope this helped, and GOOD LUCK with your search!"
4,Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition,"I ordered the book for one of managers and he was happy to receive it. So yes a happy costumer!Thank you, Jacqueline"
5,this blew me away,"Gosh...I was amazed when I first saw this. I touched me more than I could believe. Neal Morse has an amazing testimony to tell and I am so happy he is telling it, especially through music! The music is pure genius and the musicians are definitely up to Neal's composition. This is a must have for anybody, not just Neal Morse, transatlantic, or Spock's Beard fans. BUY IT!!!!!!!"
5,I couldn't put it down...,"This book is really good because it actually tells people about how other peoples' life is like. Three best friends getting along and not getting along at a certain time. And one of the girls' parents are getting a divorce, which is really hard on her, and with her brother running away, things just got out of hands. Her parents are always getting into fights and she just got so tired of it, she's putting on more pounds. Which in this case, it's actually really happening in real life. I know this is a really good book, so, I preferr every girl to read it!!!"
5,Friendship is told through the writing of one great author.,"There are so many questions that children just don't know the answers to. In all of Judy's books, there is an answer. Just as Long as We're Together was a true novel that had a perfect seeting and perfect characters. It went through the torments of starting a new highschool and the sadness of fights in friendships. Just as Long as We're Together gave you a point of view and the answer through the pen of one talented writer! Expect a good read from this!"
5,Just As Long As We're Together review by me,"This book is about three friends, Stephanie, Alison, and Rachael. It is from the perspective of 12 year old Stephanie. Stephanie is friendly and optimistic (according to Rachael). Rachael is very senstitive and a straight A student, and Alison is friendly, funny, and senstitive. The three friends get along well together but they do come to some problems.This book is all about friendship, school, and 7th grade girls. It is a book that once you start, you cannot put down."
4,One of my favorite Judy Blume books,"If you are thinking about buying this book then BUY IT!!! It is a great book for preteens and teens. Once i picked it up i could not put it down. The story line is wonderful. I can not wait intil i get the next book Here's to you, Rachel Robinson. So anyone who asks me if they should buy it or not i would say BUY IT!!!"
5,The Best Book I've Read!!!,"I've read this book more than any other book I have! Stephanie is someone I can relate to, not so popular, not so perfect, but happy the way I am. I read this book when ever I can. If you're a fan of Judy Blume, read this book, it's her best work ever (and even if you're 9 you'll love it, that's when I got my hands on this book)!!!"
5,GREAT!,This book really relates to teens and what they are going though in life. I reccomend this book to any one who is looking for a great book to read. You feel like you are really there in the story.
5,A refreshing look on what's really happening in teen's lives,"Usually books about teens are fake, not showing wht we really have to go through in life. The book ""Just as Long as we're Together"" was a real outlook on friendship, how difficult it is to go through in a paren't seperation. This is a great book for people all ages. This has been my fave book of all time (except for a few other books!) I should know after reading 9 times. Trust me, you'll never get tired of it."
5,Simply the best.,"I read this book so dang many times in my early teen years that the cover of the book finally gave up and fell off. I of course still kept it- it's worth a hundred reads. Great story of 3 best friends, the boys they crush on, and their coming into womanhood. Buy it for your daughter or granddaughter."
1,Toxic Clothing,"Their clothing contain 95% of PVC, a toxic plastic known to cause cancer over the long term. The PVC is mixed with plasticizers in order to make it soft for clothing. Not to mention the company runs a Multi-Level Marketing scheme.Dont' waste your money and put your health at risk."
4,Cook's,"A good way to get a whole year of Cook's Illustrated in bound form and cheaper than buying the magazine by subscription. I got 4 of them and got free shipping, so how can you go wrong?One can learn a lot from this source, and being in a bound, book format is icing on the cake.The only thing is, it's hard to locate individual tips or recipes in such a large format, so have your bookmarks ready!"
2,Scattered,"It was hard to follow and a bit disappointing.I think some one else should write about Darby Crash,because his life was very interesting.A lot of the stories are conflicting."
5,Darby-The 'Glitter' influenced performance artist,"I love The Germs. I love this era of punk rock. I love that Southern California had it's own punk rock cult leader . We went to the same high school! I like how this book portrayed Darby as kind of nerdy and idealistic. I appreciated that he was such an earnest fan of David Bowie,searching for hidden meanings in his lyrics on LSD. I was also fascinated by the strange relationship with his mother. I thought the book did an excellent job of humanizing an ""icon"". I could really see and feel him as a disturbed young man creating work that still has profound ripple effects."
4,Living In The Past was written by J.Tull; stop doing it!,"Somewhere in my garage is an original pressing of ""G.I."" I was listening to Rodney Bingenheimer's show the night Darby gave out a satellite number so you could call long distance for free, and yes, it worked. But . . . and this is a big ""but"" . . . had Darby lived he would be 45 years old now! I loved the time, I loved the music, I think he had tremendous potential, but it should be like a high school yearbook, something buried in a box you which crosses your mind in passing maybe once a year. Time to let it all go. I see young punks in the street, dressed in black with chains, spikey hair and Clash/Germs/Sex Pistols/X t-shirts, and I want to walk up to them, wearing my suit and tie, and say, ""I saw those bands. I spoke to them. That was over 20 years ago! Make your own history, stop wearing it."""
2,One of the most overrated Punk bands ever,"Lets be real for a minute. The Germs music [stunk] andDarby Crash is the all-time worst Punk vocalist. He's bad even by Punk standards (that's really saying something).This book attempts to make Mr. Crash into some sort of Intelligent, misunderstood,/Punk Rock messiah. The problem is, he comes off looking like a complete Peabrain.If you're to believe this book, Darby Crash was a sad mess. Just another lost kid too screwed up from his family life (or lack of), who in the end, killed himself because his Homosexuality didnt jive with his hardcore punk image. It's not even interesting, it's just sad and stupid.At the very least, I was hoping for an Insightfull, behind the scenes look at the late 70's LA Punk scene. But the book is a total snoozefest all the way through.You wanna know about Darby Crash? Watch him stumbling around in a drunken stupor in the punk bio, ""THE DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION"" one more time.Thats all you'll ever need to know."
5,"Milhaud, a new favourite","I have only discovered the music of Milhaud lately while researching for a show. I love his quirky funny music, different keys going at the same time. The woodwind music is lovely, chortling and weaving. There is a joy about his music, and this CD certainly expresses that!"
4,an excellent movie - great actors and humor !,"I really enjoy Bad Boys because Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are very cool and funny. Michael Bay knows very well how to film Miami and cars chases ! I have seen BAD BOYS many times and each time it is a real pleasure. You'll love the movie, you'll love the music... I don't regret to have this 2 DVD-set bought !"
3,Don't Wait for the Collector's Edition,This version of Bad Boys has a lot more extra's than the collectors edition and that edition is missing 30 mins of footage
3,Durable but a bit too bulky,"Well constructed with a solid feel, lots of compartments and zip closure. Unfortunately, it is bulky and I wound up by something a little thinner that would slide easier into a vest pocket."
5,This is very convenient.,"This organizer is unisex, stylish, and conveniently fits everything you need without having to rummage through carry-ons at the airport. My boyfriend was even jealous and now he wants one."
5,Excellent!,"Althought it doesn't look like the picture in the outside, it is exactly the same in the inside. Great quality, confortable for keeping in hand all the basic stuff you need to travel. I love it!!!"
1,Received the wrong thing from Vendor,"I ordered 4 of these for Christmas presents to be delivered to my parents since I live overseas and they were traveling to meet me. The company sent one shoulder bag instead. I contacted the company and basically I now bear the responsibility of returning the item and dealing with Amazon to get a refund then re-ordering them. Needless to say, these will not be Christmas presents this year. This is especially frustrating to me since I do not live in the US ordering online allows me make certain that my family in the states are remembered during the holidays."
3,From a kids point of view,"I know this book was writen more for a parent. So my parents got this book for them and the book Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors for me. However, we both ended up reading both books and we both liked the Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors Book a lot more because it covered a lot more important information and was simply more enjoyable to read. Don't missunderstand me, A Parents Guide to Chess is a fairly good book, it is just I feel the newer one has simuler material, and more and is just a lot better. I acually recommend getting both!"
5,"An informative read, written for moderate custody disputes","I just read the book and as a product of divorced parents I found it to be quite informative. I was comforted to learn that there are many, many people in my shoes. I would recommend this book to both people going through divorces, lawyers, and adult children of divorced parents."
1,"Worth the read, but with caution.","This book depicts the judicial system as corrupt. If you start out with that in mind you will tend to feel victimized. The system is a collection of laws, attitudes, accepted norms and people doing a job. To expect everything to come to halt to take care of you and your children is unrealistic. Judges, lawyers, mediators and the rest of the system didn't get up this morning bent on doing you harm. They are doing a job, just as you do your job. With guidelines, bosses and parameters they have to meet.To see everyone as ""despicable people have zero regard for children or other people, but only for the money that they can extract at the expense of other people's pain and conflict"" is debilitating.This book is only a tool. A marginally good tool. You can see the low price for which it is being resold. It is worth the $7.00"
2,Very depressing to read.,"I am a woman and read this book for the benefit of my fiance and his daughter. While there were some excellent tips for figuring out a good strategy for winning custody battles, the examples of men's situations and numerous defeats was depressing! I was especially surprised by the number of men implying that their former spouses just suddenly went nuts and started acting crazy. If men can't get a CLUE, then they shouldn't get custody. If you're a man and you like the idea that women for the most part are stupid, bi-polar, and downright vindictive then you'll love this book. I do have to say that the advice given on looking for a good lawyer, and how to ""act"" in the courtroom were fairly good. If your ex is so awful that you feel propelled to read this book, I recommend ""Joint Custody with a Jerk"" instead."
2,A BOMB,This bombs it is a bunch of movies just the preview and they are old really old. There is no sex or nudity nothing it sucks don't get it.
2,2 big,"They're built tough. However, they're big. really big. We really don't use them now because of there size. I wish they were smaller a bit half way then back to there big size again, at least you would be able to use the first half."
2,Okay,"Not as excited as I thought I would be. Good for grilling b/c do not rotate on the grill, but bad for skewering b/c so wide."
4,Grilling skewers,"After watching a show featuring Chef Bobby Flay using these (or a similar product), I was convinced these would be much better than the $2.99 batch of chinese made junk skewers from Walmart and and am happy to say, these work great to prevent the food from rolling around on the skewer. However, the raised handle causes the handle end to stick up and away from the grill surface when turned over and so one side/end is not done as quickly as the rest.I have since moved on to the firewire/cable type and am very pleased with them. After skewering the food, slip them into a ziplock bag with marinade. When the grill is ready, pull them right out of the bag and onto the grill. It still takes two hands to properly rotate the food but a small price to pay for the convienience."
2,Skewer Review,"While there is no doubt that this is a quality item, I found them to be much too long and unwieldy. They are huge and would only work well on the largest of grills.I also found them to be difficult to skewer anything with. They are very wide (I know there are narrower ones) but any vegetable I tried to put on them (onions, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, bell peppers) split almost every time no matter how careful I was.So I guess if you have a large grill and want to skewer large firm items such as beef or swordfish, they would be great although still difficult to manuever."
3,"Lives up to reputation, but too expensive!","I really like these skewers, but was not impressed with the price. I feel they were too expensive."
4,STAINLESS STEEL SKEWERS,"THE 3/8-INCH WIDE STAINLESS STEEL SKEWERS ARE VERY NICE AND LOOK LIKE THEY WILL BE GREAT, THOUGH WE HAVEN'T YET TRIED THEM.THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT AND SHIPPING WAS FREE!"
2,Good product but the edge is too sharp that it cut your fingers,"Solid skewer. Good quality for the money. However, the pointy edge is razor sharp. I actually cut my index finger trying to skewered the meat. I know it's me being careless, but the damage would have been less had the edge not be this sharp. As my finger still hurts badly after 3 days, overall not such a great product."
3,stainless steel ? barbecue skewers,"The actual skewer is wonderful to use, keeping the meat and veggies from moving around. However, after putting them in the dishwasher to clean they came out with rust on them, so are they actually stainless steel. I recommend hand washing."
5,Essential for Asian and Middle Eastern cooking,"Just what you need for Turkish style kebabs and vegetables that would otherwise be hard to handle on the grill. The flat design means no rolling around and the food is held better than with the cheap round skewers. However, you need barbecue gloves to handle these safely."
3,"Work ok, but cheaply made and blunt ends","I bought the skewers based on the reviews listed here, and the work ok. The stainless steel used to manufacture them is of cheap quality and they are a flimsy, I can easily bend them. The skewers arrived blunt, so I had to sharpen the pointed end so that they would not rip the meat.I expeted a better quality product from a brand name like Steven Raichlen."
2,Not all Stainless is rust resistant,"These skewers showed slight rust after running through the dishwasher. For future cleaning I will wash by hand, which seemed to eliminate the rust.Ok for the price I paid for them, but not the greatest."
2,incomplete,"The worst documentry in the WW2 german series.The series of DVDS this belongs to cover in a 5 star rating the U-Boats,Tanks,and Support weapons of WW2 but when it came to doing this DVD the research was just not there nor did one learn much about German bombing missions during ww2 other than bombers were used as extended artillery.Skip this one and look for much better in the series."
3,"A good book, but not the best reference","Software Inspection by Gilb covers the subject a lot better. However, Freedman and Weinberg's book has a lot of good points on group dynamics and politics and such that Gilb doesn't get into. Freedman's book is a quick read too."
4,"Review of Walkthroughs, Inspections, and Technical Reviews","The book Walkthroughs, Inspections, and Technical Reviews is a very informative text that is organized in a unique manner. The organization of the book takes a while getting used to. I am curious if the book would take a different approach in the era of lean systems engineering."
2,Not My Favorite,"On one hand, I appreciated that this was not a cookie cutter period romance. And yet it left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. It's not the adultery, but the fact that the hero is the man through whom all the murders for hire, gambling, and prostitution in London must go. As he tells Isabella at one point, if her kidnappers had gone through the ""right channel,"" he wouldn't have batted an eye at her murder. Yes, he has a vague sort of moral compass (not hitting women, etc.), but I don't find that it makes up for his greater flaws. As a previous reviewer said, his unsavory career is never really addressed, which I find unsettling."
3,I've Read Better,"I have read most of Karen Robards novels so my rating is based soully on comparison. Most of the time she is great but some times the story is a bit flat. I found this one to be a bit flat. This is not the worst, I still have not finished Heart Breaker out of sheer disgust.Judging by other reviews I appear to be alone in that opinion. By the sound of things I don't like this author very much so I must redeem myself. I would highly recommend Green Eyes, Scandalous, Maggie's Child, Desire in the Sun, One Summer, and Whispers at Midnight."
5,Rivetting,I think this book was wonderful. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I couldn't put it down. It's definitely a must-read!
3,Not her best,I really didn't like this book. It is not up to K.R. standards now. The plot was silly and unbelievable. The hero and heroine were annoying. I only read it because i spent my hard earned money on it. I kept waiting for the plot to heat up but it never did. What I could have done with a king of the underworld plot i don't know but it has to be better than this. There was no chemistry between the hero and heroine and I wanted the hero to be a dangerous man. But he wasnt. Oh well that's all.
4,worth reading,"Robards is a good writer, whether she's doing historical romance or romantic suspense her stories have tight plots and well developed characters. This historical is not quite as fast-paced as some of her thrillers but never boring, and the unlikely romance takes unexpected turns along the way. A good rainy day read."
5,"excellent company, excellent product","I have ordered several products from this company. This shipping is fast, the quality excellent. Will check here first if looking for more sterling silver jewelry"
5,rich man poor man book,book was in excellent condition (like new) and my friend was estatic that i found it for her. she loves it! thanks sooooo much.
5,Great Book,"I got this book recently for a friends kids (twelve years old) birthday present. It got a casual thank you and put aside for the other action toys, video games and the like. About 2 weeks ago my friend rang me and said that his son had picked up the book, started to read it and was hooked, he is right into the book now. He is building the toys in the book himself (with his dads help) and has the hang of it so much he even attempted to create his own optical illusions."
2,"One word: ""meh""","Like most of us, I got hooked on Jel when my buddy let me borrow his copy of Greenball. In a desperate, year-long search to locate my own copy I eventually decided to try out some of Jel's other offerings and came upon 10 Seconds. The format is similar, but the tracks on 10 Seconds struggle to capture the essence of what made Greenball so successful, and fail to recreate the intensely mellow beats that make Greenball such a good driving disc. If you're a huge fan of Jel or spin your own music this CD will likely yield some good things for you. Casual fans stay away."
2,"will not fits oils filters from 2 3/16"" as advertised","I tried opening oil filter on two toyota cars. Camry and Rav4. The specs says it Fits oils filters from 2 3/16"". This is wrong, the minimum is 2 1/2"", so it wont fit the small filters of toyota 2.4L engines.If you have a bigger filter, the product is well built."
2,Not what I thought,"The product was deficientely described. It should have been clearly mentioned that it was a condensed version of the works by Pearl Buck. I was very disappointed since no serious reader reads condensed versions of books. The title ''A Pearl Buck reader'' does not indicate clearly the condensed characteristic of the books. Had I known, I could have easily ordered the other versions available on Amazon."
5,Book Exceeds Expectations,"This book was a pleasant surprise. I expected it to be either a sordid tell-all type book or a slobbering fan's paen to his beloved Jesse. Instead I discovered a well-written, intelligent, honest, and entertaining biography. It is not perfect. The author errs on the side of caution, not discussing the darker elements of James' life, but such sordid details seem beneath the author. If the quote in the above review is an example of Mr. James' writing ability, this is the book to buy."
1,unforgiving,i bought the book. read the book. didnt believe half the book. then spoke directly to jesse james himself. only to find out that 99.9% of the book was unauthorized. so i then trashed the book.mike seate did his research and implementing of information WRONG. He attended jesse's annual no love party just to take pictures to publish in this book.i do not recommend reading this material.look for information and books out in the future that mr. james himself had authorized and contributed to himself.dont believe everything you read.
1,not worth the cost of a friendship,"Lots of old photos,lots of innacuracies. Nothing at all new. Un-authorized piece of you know what.The author betrayed Jesse and put this out without his permission.A 17 year friendship thrown out the window for a quick buck. Save your money. It`s junk.I didn`t even want to give it ONE star,but I had to."
1,Worthless,"first and foremost, it's an un-authorized book about jesse James and secondly, no facts in this book were checked. Many of the photo captions are incorrect, bikes are not credited to their actual owners, information has been twisted out of shape.Save your money folks, you'll be glad you did"
1,If you are a true MG/WCC/Jesse James Fan,"If you are a true fan, you will not support Mike Seate by purchasing this book. Jesse James, himself, has come out and publicly stated that he did not authorize this book. Mike Seate violated and abused a friendship. If you are a decent upstanding person with good morals and high standards, you will not purchase this book."
4,Great fun,"Funny how some folks like something, and others don't. I don't know why this game has some strong negative reviews, but put my name down on the side of loving the game.The 2 player game is really great. My friends and I play for hours and hours at a time.While tetris was great, I also like the added game play. The sliding colors take a while to learn, but add new aspects to the play."
2,I Must Be Doing Something Wrong,Because I find this game to be quite easy and pretty boring. I loved the original Tetris and don't think this is a worthy successor.
3,"not bad, but not fabulous either","Good things: The gameplay is pretty good, but I didn't much care for the timed single player mode.Bad things: The background music! Just awful. And the voices, congratulating you every time you finish a level. Sheesh.All in all, it's great if you can get it a good discount but certainly isn't worth the full price. Just turn off the background music and voices and play your own mp3s and it's fun."
2,The graphics are horrible,"The graphics on my dads Original Atari system from the 80's are better than the graphics on this remake. I expected better from a playstation game. I love Tetris, but this version is horrible.Save your money."
2,"I Don't recommend this item, spend more on a better scope.","This Scope is ok, however the zoom is very,very hard to turn. I am using it as a non-zooming scope and it works fine. Zoom feature is bad."
4,Classic Ron Goodwin,"Classic Ron Goodwin soundtrack, probably outshining the movie itself. Not quite as good as Battle Of Britain, better than some others, decent recording quality."
4,"Great quality, great price","I purchased this to include in the toolkit I carry around in my truck. It's great. Solid quality, great price. I'm by no means a full-time auto mechanic, so cannot attest to reliability in repetitive daily use. But as a shade-tree mechanic that needs certain tools to function at occasional (but crucial) times, I'm more than happy with Tekton and their other products. If you need a back-up/emergency kit, don't think twice."
4,Fairy Tales of a scary world!!,"Ive read many versions of this book.. Its the same story pretty much.The fairy tales seem a little out there put there fun, the main character of the book isthis ""god"" who loves everyone yet wants them to fear him by threatening a endless afterlife of horror and fire...HmmmThe other part to the story is the ""son of god"" or ""jesus"".. i got a little lost but its a great tale about him being a cosmicjewish zombie. The bad part is about the people having such a closed mind!Anyway i cant seem to find an author who wrote this and thats a little weird,but if i do id like to read more stories like this!!Oh one more thing i found out that makes this book very creepy is a cult of people actually believing the fairy tales!!!!!!The cult being called religion that seems to overtake the earth having the whole world have war over this!!!!Holy Crap! Thank science that none of this is true!!!!"
3,FINALLY!,"With this small, lightweight and aesthetically pleasing version of God's word, I can bring my shame for my body along with me everywhere I go!! Its a must have for ANYONE that needs confirmation from a God that your life has meaning."
4,Be Blessed,"The ""Bible"" is always a book that I cherish. This particuliar one was purchased for my teen daughter. It has word big enough for her to read and the table of contents is even more detailed. Everyone in my home has their own bible."
1,Not The Best Historical Fiction Novel I've Read,"The whole things start off with two contradictory creation accounts in the book of Genesis. The first, in Genesis 1:1-2:3, claims that humans were created AFTER the animals and that man and woman were created at the same time. The second creation account, in Genesis 2:4-25, states that humans were created BEFORE the animals, and that men were made before women with some sort of Supernatural BBQ Rib recipe. The bible just gets worse from there. The plot is non-existent, the characters are totally unbelievable, and the writing style changes from page to page. The stories of bloody human sacrifice, rape, and torture make this fiction book totally inappropriate for any child under the age of 17. Pass. One out of five stars."
2,Boring,"I read this book because a lot of people suggest that it will answer some profound question intrinsic to the human condition. I found it to be boring as hell. On top of that it is essentially worthless and chalk full of nonsense. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. I think some of the gospels are pretty decent. That's about it. The book of Mormon is every bit as worthless philosophically but at least it's interesting. I think the ""Christians"" should seriously consider revising this book. If creator of reality really wanted people know this stuff he should of ""inspired"" the writers to make it more entertaining and relatable not to mention believable. If you are considering buying this book, I recommend against it and suggest you buy Aesop's fables instead. It has the morals as well and is much more entertaining without all the pretense.I will give this book 2 stars because the gospels are a good read and the price is pretty reasonable for the about of book your are getting."
2,Too Po-mo by half,"I am so tired of this kind of magical realist, self-referential claptrap. There is such a thing as too much foreshadowing guys... No one is impressed by having your characters quote the author. We've seen it all before Rushdie! And what is the deal with the Book of Numbers? I get that you're trying to ""deconstruct"" whatever it is you find oppressive about ""narrative"" but seriously, come on. At least that one was accurately titled. You can't call it Revelations if you don't explain anything.Mine must have shipped without a dust jacket because I couldn't find the author bio. I bet it's some elitist new england hippie."
1,Not the same as Toyota's air filter,"I've learned the hard way.... These do not allow air to flow in the same way as the Toyota filter. After a few months, the ""check engine"" light came on, and the code led to the air filter. The replacement filter was an extra 10 dollars, but the diagnostic check by the dealer cost 79 dollars more. Most expensive air filter I've ever bought--three years ago.Stupidly, when having my oil changed recently at a Firestone dealer, they told me the air filter needed to be replaced--""go ahead""--and another Fram air filter placed (I forgot...)Two months later the check engine light is again on, same code and another expensive air filter replacementAt least for a 2000 Avalon, be careful with this one."
5,Fram CA7351 Extra Guard Round Plastisol Air Filter,Came on time. Fit like a glove. No problem. I have a 2001 Toyota Camry Gallery series. It is automatic with 6 cylinders. no complaints.
2,not Mac compatible,"nowhere in the description does this product state that it is only compatible w/PC's. i was excited to load up some pictures on it for my daughter. when i hooked it up and attempted to open the program, i realized that it would not work on my MacBook. now i am going to have to transfer all the pictures i want on it to my husband's computer. so much for quick & easy. i have no idea if it even works at this point. and a minor detail, the description states it takes 2 AAA batteries. it does not. it takes 2 AA batteries. can't give this toy a higher rating because i have no idea if it works, and my frustration level with getting a product i cannot currently use is annoying."
5,Thrilling Book!,"After reading ""Chasing Demons"", all I can say is, make sure you have time to read this book from cover to cover when you start, because it's one you'll get so caught up in, you will not want to put it down. It's just thrilling - especially when the author moves the story into high-gear - when Tony gets an inkling as to Kendra's whereabouts and goes after her.The love story between Kendra and Garth is gentle and caring, a complete antithesis to what Kendra experienced with her abusive husband Tony. Tony's demented efforts to locate his wife are filled with violence and brutality.Ms. French is an author who can hold a reader's attention, no matter what she is writing about. I would love to see more by her. Exceptional book."
5,"""I enjoy this writer's southern style""","Ms. French has a unique writing style all her own. I find that refreshing. After enjoying her first two novels (Chasing Horses & Wayne's Dead) I was eager to read the third. What a BLOCKBUSTER she has created with her newest offering of romantic intrigue, 'Chasing Demons.' The characters are real to the reader and the plot held my attention until the finish. A most impressive combination. I plan on rereading this book for possible consideration in my next film.John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures Inc.California"
5,Would Love to See This as a Movie,"""Chasing Demons"" has all the elements of a thrilling movie: romance, suspense, action, good vs. evil, a woman who is willing to lose her life in order to remain apart from her abusive husband, a man who is seeking forgiveness for a tragic mistake, a beautiful love story, an evil, violent man tracking his runaway wife, and a killer with a heart of gold.The story is well-paced and kept me entertained throughout. Another reviewer referred to this as a page-turner, and believe me, it is. There is nothing disappointing or lagging about this book. I loved it!"
2,Not up to par,"I started reading this book after having read all of the Bodyguard series, and was terribly disappointed. The characters lack all of the spunk and spirit of the ones I'd grown fond of in her other books, and the plot is certainly not up to par with the others. I didn't originally realize that this book was published earlier than the others, but after reading just the first chapter, I thought it surely must be since it lacks so much that I've enjoyed in her later works. I'll give 5 stars to the Bodyguard series for fun and originality, but this one certainly lacks those qualities. While I raced through the others in a day or two, I've been dragging through this one for over a week, and still haven't finished it, but the outcome is already clear."
3,Good story but a little too dark,"Ms. French seems to enjoy writing books in this genre. I just finished reading Wayne's Dead which was a story I found to be a bit on the 'severe' side, that is to say, until, I finished reading her, Chasing Demons. I usually enjoy a good thriller but not when the writer takes the storyline overboard. Not only was the storyline a bit overdone, but more attention should have been given to the editing of this book. Bottom line, Chasing Demons is a good story but a little too dark for my tastes."
1,Worst book I've ever read,"It was a struggle to get even half way through this book. It is so amateurishly written, poorly edited and incoherent that I didn't see the point of even finishing it. Just like the author's other book, Chasing Horses, this one is horrible."
3,Meh...,"It was alright...if you like Lifetime Movie Network, you will LOVE this story. I, however, can't stand Lifetime movies because its always the same kind of story. I was expecting a good thriller, but this was just a love story with some violence here and there."
2,Danger - wrong item shipped,"If you're ordering an impact socket, you probably already know that regular sockets can literally explode if used with an impact wrench. I ordered a Michigan Industrial Tools 1/2"" drive x 15/16"" shallow impact socket to use with my impact wrench. Unfortunately, the merchant shipped a regular socket rather than an impact socket. I would have rated this item one star, but Amazon stepped in and refunded my money without requiring me to ship back the regular socket. Five stars for Amazon and zero for the merchant, which averages out to 2.5 stars. I'm rounding down to two stars because I'm still upset that someone who didn't know better might have been injured by this mistake."
4,Worth reading,This is a very extensive review of the vaccine risks faced by young children. The exhaustive list of resources and information presented is clear and detailed. It's not a light read but it is worth reading for anyone considering whether or not to follow the vaccine schedule.
5,Great anthropomorphic adventure!,"The Claw and the Spiderweb tells the story of a despondent hero, the cat Sir Pontipaws of Meadow-Wood, and his fight against the vicious Lord Claw, a bear ruler who has become evil from power. After his friend Sir Adkins the owl is captured while traveling to Claw's kingdom, Pontipaws sets off to rescue him. With the help of a small spider, Webberly, a white owl named Lady Snowdrop, and a brave beaver, they manage to infiltrate the castle and rescue Adkins. But it is only with the help of the Great White Eagle, a legend no one thought was real, that they together are truely able to defeat Lord Claw. The novel is very well written and Reddix really has you worrying for her characters. Pontipaws, too, is an appealing protagionist, but unlike you would expect a hero to be, he has flaws, which also helps to make him believeable. If anthropomorphic fantasy is your thing, be sure to read this novel! ^_^"
5,Charming,The photographed subjects in this book are totally charming - these folks are so in love with their livestock. Just like in our household!
4,"""An UnAuthorized Success!""","Charles Kader, academic librarian writes: ""<This collectible guide to the world of the Planet of the Apes movie series is a comprehensive attempt to balance color photographs and subject content. The author Sausville succeeds in a commendable first effort, drawing upon his own zeal as a veteran Apes collector. I personally own a medium sized collection of Planet of the Apes print and non-print materials, and found this volume to be the new subject centerpiece, as well as pathfinder. About the only place Sausville does not take us in this 1998 glossy cover is into the world of the Apes collectors who the author has met as a tireless collector of this science fiction genre. Hurrah for an unauthorized success! We now await the ""official"" guide, in light of the anticipated remake of the 1968 film. It already has big boots to fill>"" Charles Kader, MLS (Mohawk Nation) cjkader@yahoo.com"
4,Dave's third and best 80's album,"Chosen People is easily the best and the most accessible of the three albums Dave recorded in the early 80s. While the first two albums sounded like heavy metal work outs, with the third album Dave chose to introduce acoustic guitars, keyboards and strings. This makes the album more diverse and the songmaterial is more mature and much stronger. Would be nice if Dave would add some tracks of this album to his setlist if and when he goes back on the road. Cheers dave!"
5,YAY!,This is exactly what I was looking for. I bought it used and it was practically new. Great quality. I would definitively buy from them again.
2,The plot dies early,"I know there is a lot of hype on the series, but its beyond me why it deserves it. Episodes 2-5 do show some potential, but after that the series fizzles out in a string of sub-plots that have nothing to do with what was supposed to be the premise of the series."
3,"One to See, Not to Own","This is a really good show, but it's definitely not worth it to pay 30+ to own it. I had watched about 5 episodes online before I decided that it might be worth buying the series (it's that good) however I wish I had seen it all before I did. The ending is unsatisfying and leaves you wondering why such a great show was canceled before it could be finished! Watch it online, enjoy it and then move on with your life."
3,"Warning, this does NOT include season 2!","Not really a product review, but a warning.This is simply a cheaper packaged version of the season 1 box set.I pre-ordered this directly from Bandai Entertainment thinking it contained both Haruhi season 1 and season 2. I was led to believe this from Bandai's website which stated ""Episodes: All of them!"".I also knew that season 2 was due to be released this summer, and this had a July sale date, so I assumed that THIS was going to be season 2.You almost have to wonder if this was done on purpose to get some more sales from confused folks.You can imagine my reaction when I opened the package!At any rate, the actual release of season 2 is in August apparently; there is a pre-order here on Amazon somewhere.In good faith, I can't give this a ""1 star"". It is Haruhi after all. I just wish that they were more clear on their marketing."
3,Typical Judson Philips/Hugh Pentecost,"Judson Philips/Hugh Pentecost novels are always enjoyable if not memorable. The plots range from fair to good. The characters are one-dimensional. However, these novels are well-written and move along at a good pace.""Bargain With Death"" is one of the Pierre Chumbrun series. Chumbrun is manager of the exclusive Beaumont Hotel in New York City, and he takes it as personal affront when one of his guests is murdered in the hotel. Such an event occurs in each Chumbrun novel (I wonder why the head of the Beaumont security never gets fired.) he has become an accomplished detective.The plot for ""Bargain With Death"" is more complicated than usual but below average. There are some plot flaws: What kind of professional allows his boss's room and telephone to be bugged? What murderer, professional or amateur, holds onto a murder weapon for five years?"
3,I did not expect this!!.,"After a long research, I bought this system with a great expectation. My previous home theater (Panasonic SC-HT05) was only 600 Watts.This system has enough power to fill a BIG room. It did very well with movies; the six speakers works great and give you a real theater feeling. When I tried some music CDs the sound was muddy and there was no punching effect. I expected more from this big speaker but was very disappointed. I tried different bass/treble settings, tried to adjust the speaker/subwoofer sounds and nothing helped.If you are like me buying this system for music and movies, be aware of this. Returning this system will cost you lots of money!!."
1,Awful!,"Harvesting the Heart was the worst book ever! It was such dribble, I didn't believe anything about it...I thought how many times can eyes flash with rage, how many times this and that - I loved My Sister's Keeper and Nineteen Minutes, so I thought this would be great and it was just awful - I kept thinking maybe it would get better, but it didn't. Then I saw that it was written in 1993 and I'm thinking it must have been her first - it was terrible, really, don't bother - I can't believe others liked it."
4,Could have been better,"The story line was great, but was kind of lost in the end. Jumped around a little more than most of her novels."
5,Are you sure this is used?,The book look completely new. Who ever had it before clearly didn't read it or just took amazing care of it.
3,Ok,"This book was ok, entirely too long!!! I didn't understand why the author had to go into so many details with the horse farm. Also she didn't really finish the storyline with her parents."
2,Talk about a downer of a book!!,I found this book depressing and the characters in it so self-absorbed that it was hard to have empathy for any of them.
1,Way to Preachy,"This is the first and last book I will read by this author. It was way too preachy. All the references to G-d and the author's opinions on abortion, human relations and religion were more than one fiction novel need to contain. This is the last Picoult novel for me."
1,Hated It!,"I absolutely hated this book. I took it with me on a cruise because it was a selection of our Book Club. My poor husband had to hear me say ""I hate this book! I hate these characters!"" over and over. I hated Emily for walking out on her husband and baby and just driving, driving, driving away one night. I was more sympathetic to Nicholas because he, at least, showed great promise in his field and was pursuing a career that would benefit the whole family. Emily's walking out on her father and leaving a note ""I won't be coming back"" ----- what the heck is that all about? How do you do that to your father? I hated that the book started out with a dramatic scene at the house but flashes back for most of the book and you are trying to figure out why the opening drama has taken place. I read this book as fast as I could, just to get it over with. I cannot recall ever detesting a character as much as I did Emily. This was my first Picoult book and will definitely be my last."
5,My New Favorite Author,"Jodi Picoult has quickly become my new favorite author. I really enjoyed Harvesting the Heart. The characters really come to life. Most of the novel is very real and touching. A few parts made me laugh out loud. Whenever I need a laugh, I think about Paige and the ""shirt"" scene.Jodi Picoult is a wonderful storyteller. Each novel is truly unique. Harvesting the Heart is one of the best."
2,What happened to Jodi?,"I have read many of Jodi Picoult's books, and in the past she has been one of my favorite authors. However, this book though an interesting story, had so many errors it was distracting to read. I was curious if this was just a problem with the Kindle addition, or the paperback also. It seemed crazy that Penguin would distribute a book with so many errors in grammar, and punctuation.There were words left out, words doubled,and misspelled. Sorry, Ms. Picoult, but I'll be a little more cautious when I look at your next one."
2,A Bit of a Let Down,"Having read many of Picoult's novels and becoming quite the fan, I was pretty disappointed with this novel. The characters were difficult to relate to and I found the main character to be to flaky and awkward. And while many of Picoult's past novels have been page turners (The Pact, 19 minutes, House Rules), this one felt like more of an assignment than anything."
3,I wouldn't read it again.,"The book was not a page turner. It was just ok. I liked her book ""House Rules"" about a child with Asbergers, much better. Thats why I decided to try this one."
2,dissapointment,"Usually love Jodi Picoult, but this one just fell apart for me. I liked the story, but felt like it just didn't stick together. I thought it might redeem itself in the end, but I was mistaken."
1,Hard to relate,"I found it hard to relate to the character. As a mom, I cannot imagine leaving my baby for no reason without even letting my husband know. It was not as easy of a read and not as interesting as her other books. I was disappointed."
3,Real Life Drama,"This book tells about the day to day struggle of a newly married couple both wishing for more. Little do they realize, its each other that makes them complete. Pretty typical. My Sisters Keeper was much much better."
3,Harvesting the Heart and other Jodi Picoult books,"I have read a number of Jodi Picoult's books and always enjoy the story. Her characters are well developed and the reader is invested in them - which makes her endings all the more disappointing. It seems as if she becomes tired of her characters and wraps up story lines quickly without a real ending. Harvesting the Heart actually had a more satisfying resolution than Saving Faith or Vanishing Acts - which, after a great build up and story just.....ended. Wrapped up too quickly, unrealistically and just over. As if she became tired of telling this story mid way through.The Pact is probably one of the better resolutions in books of hers that I have read - but overall I would enjoy her stories better if the conclusions were actually brought to one. I leave her books wondering what happened after she quit writing and that is not satisfying."
2,Disappointing,"I read ""The Pact"" by the same author and it was so wonderful. This book was just disappointing. The ending wasn't satisfying."
1,Overrated on Amazon!,"I rarely write reviews, but because I was duped by the reviews on Amazon into buying this book, I thought I would save other unsuspecting buyers the trouble and boredom of slogging through this poorly written mess. I buy many books on Amazon based on customer recommendations and am always pleased, but this book is the exception. It's simply awful; the story is cliched, the writing is juvenile, and I kept waiting for that moment when the book ""gets good"" (it never arrived). Go read T. Greenwood, Mary Carr or Dani Shapiro if you are interested in stories about women finding themselves; all three write in a simple, poetic manner that Picoult simply doesn't have the natural instinct for."
5,The Ultimate Escape,What a tear jerker! This book is awesome in taking you away from your own world and into another. You really feel for each character. I couldn't put the book down and stayed up all night ON A WORK NIGHT!! I found myself crying so hard at one point and didn't realize it until I felt my pillowcase. It's a must read for anybody who ever thought that they missed out on something in your childhood.
3,i've read better books by this author,this is the third book i've read by jodi picoult and i found it to be a bit disappointing. i liked the character development but it takes so long to peak and then the ending is pretty flat and leaves you hanging. i think a much better choice by this author would be my sister's keeper.
2,disappointing,"I have read half of Jodi Picoult's novels and this one was such a disappointment. I didn't care for any of the characters and just wanted to scream during the last 50 pages. I only finished it so I could find out what happened. After reading My Sister's Keeper, Vanishing Acts, and Picture Perfect (3 of the best novels I have ever read) this one was a huge let down. It felt very impersonal and boring."
3,"Not my favorite, but I still love Picoult","After reading ""Keeping Faith"" and ""Second Glance"" in record time, I was thrilled to find a copy of ""Harvesting the Heart"" in my library. Other fans of Picoult will attest that her books frequently fly off shelves in libraries and waiting lists for them are long.I liked ""Keeping Faith"" and LOVED ""Second Glance"", so I was expecting another page-turner by Picoult. While I didn't dislike the book, I didn't find it interesting either. In my opinion, the characters weren't terribly likeable or even all that believable. Unlike the other two novels, I had to force myself to finish the book.Picoult is still a master storyteller, so I recommend that you check out some of her other works, particularly ""Second Glance"". ""The Pact"", ""Salem Falls"" and ""Keeping Faith"" are also worth reading."
1,Almost Amazingly Awful,"I too made the mistake of purchasing this book based on Amazon reviews. What a disappointment!! The premise of the story was incredibly trite - I felt like I was reading a short story in Good Housekeeping rather than a Jodi Picoult novel. Not only was the plot tired, but the writing was exceedingly poor and the editing was atrocious. The characters were largely one-dimensional - I found I wasn't able to care what happened with any of them. I also couldn't get over the number of times that I found myself rereading paragraphs just to make sure it wasn't me - the time sequences were totally screwed up. It was a chore, but I slogged through to the end because I have read, and really enjoyed, several of Jodi Picoult's other novels (Plain Truth, The Pact, My Sister's Keeper) in the past. There was no redeeming twist, no nothing, just the sense that I'd wasted my time and money."
3,Thoughtful tale on motherhood.,"Fascinating window into the life of a motherless mother. Brought to life the hidden insecurities and questions that most women would encounter in the same situation. How does one be a good mother when one didn't have a mother of their own? Paige's mother abandoned her and her father when she was a little girl (5 I think) and the majority of this novel deals with Paige's eventual abandonment of her own son in an effort to reconnect with her mother and discover the truth that's been eluding Paige her whole life. Why? Why did she leave?Touches on issues of feminism..abortion, choices, that women have more to offer than just maternal love but in the end we all know that if one has a child it is one's duty to love and raise it well, not run away to live a dream.Worth finishing even though the ending somewhat predictable and anti-climactic."
2,not my fave,I am a big J Picoult fan and decided to read some of her early books. this was okay but definately not on my list of favorites. Don't use this book to judge the author!
3,What a disappointment!,"AFter reading many of the reviews in here, I went to buy the book, excited to read it! Well, it only took me 3 months to finish it! I just couldn't pick it up! It was a chore to get thru this one. I so enjoyed the Plain Truth but Harvesting the Heart just didn't flow as well. Very tough to stay interested. However, the last 100 pages were very good and the only part of the book worth reading. I'm now a bit hesitant to read a third Judy Picoult book."
2,A disappointment compared to Picoult's other books,"I've been a big fan of many of Jodi Picoult's books, especially ""Change of Heart"" and ""My Sister's Keeper,"" but this book was a huge disappointment. The storyline, like the main character, can't seem to figure out where it wants to go. My biggest problem with the book, however, is the main male character. Nicholas is such a complete jerk, arrogant, angry, selfish and self-absorbed . . . I was honestly hoping that he'd be hit by a truck so that Paige and her son could put their lives together and move on. I would not have been surprised if he had turned out to be a physically abusive husband--he has all of the psychological characteristics of an abuser. I could not believe that he could change, and so I did not want the lovers to reunite. I wanted Paige to take her son and run away and never be found. A frustrating read, to say the least!"
5,Awesome!,I absolutely loved this book. Jodi Picoult is my favorite author and I was very happy with how fast I received the book.
5,Great Book,"I just finished a book I wanted to share with you. It is by one of my favorite authors, Jodi Picoult. The book is called [...]. I happened to come across this one at a ""Friends of the Library"" sale for a dollar! It isn't typical of her writing, but while it was a little hard to get into, I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down once I started reading it. It is about a woman and a man who fall in love, one from a poor family, another an aspiring surgeon. It is an intensely emotional book, not a romance novel by any means, (I wouldn't read it if it was!) But an exploration of a relationship and what happens when a woman must discover who she is before she can love another person. It explores marriage, motherhood, family, in-laws and hurt in a captivating way. I would recommend this book!"
3,An average Picoult,"This is not one of Picoult's best, however it is worth the read. Once again the characters are very well developed and multi-layered. Bogged down a little in the middle of the book by storyline, but still a good read."
4,Jodi Picoult,"This book was good. Jodi Piccoult usually has me sitting up all night to read the book, but this one was not like that. I could lay it down and come back the next night. It was well written, but not my favorite."
4,Harvesting the Heart,"Paige, raised alone by her father after her mother left the family when Paige was just five, is making a new start for herself in Cambridge, working at a local diner. Nicholas, from a privileged life, is attending medical school when their paths happen to cross at the diner, changing both of their lives forever.The fall in love quickly and marry soon after. What neither had planned on was how their differing backgrounds would drive a wedge between them. With Paige becoming pregnant, the stresses of new motherhood are also added to the situation. Paige begins to wonder if she is destined to follow in her runaway mother's footsteps.This is an excellent novel of family relationships, and the struggles between parent and child, as well as between husband and wife. The reader explores along with the characters the wonders of creating new life, the struggle to maintain relationships as lives change, and the capacity for change within themselves."
4,Harvesting the Heart,Picoult takes you into the hearts and minds of her caracters and you feel their pain. Her research and depth of knowlege of the issues she deals with never ceases to amaze me.
2,i don't like the tunes selected by renato bruson,"i don't need a thousand words to say that this was not one of bruson's better recordings,which i have quite a few of."
2,limited,This is meant as a textbook for religious schools and focuses mostly on the Orthodox life in these areas.
4,"Good start, if you don't know the band","It has to be said: Tipica 73 was one of the best bands to come out of NY in the 1970's. They represented (and still represent) the bridge between traditional Cuban sounds and progressive musical tendencies from NY. Just a couple of names will give you an idea of what kind of ""mazacote"" we are talking about here: Adalberto Santiago, Tito Allen, Camilo Azuquita, Jose Alberto ""El Canario"", Orestes Vilato, Nicky Marrero, Johnny Rodriguez, Sonny Bravo, René Lopez, Cachete Maldonado... and the list goes on.This compilation should serve as nothing but an introduction to what the Tipica was all about. Still, this is one of those bands that produced so many great music, that it is imperative to buy most of their albums, if not all of them. Also, keep in mind that, for some reason, FANIA compilations usually have a lesser quality sound than original recordings."
5,How money and influence came to overcome truth.,"How Hughes's famous propensity for compartmentalizing his activities, keeping the right hand from knowing what the left was up to, ultimately defeated his wish to leave a portion of his immense fortune to the man who had saved his life. The debacles of the Simpson and Blake murder trials, and now the revelations of this miscarriage of justice, go to prove that given skilled attorneys and unlimited resources truth and justice need not prevail. Retired FBI agent Magnesen's investigative and narrative skills make a compelling case for the legitimacy of ""The Mormon Will"" and as a titillating aside, the story reveals Hughes's obsession for a certain lady of the evening."
5,Must read!!,The truth has come out after all these years. Magnesen has turned over many stones to get new evidence relating to the Howard Hughes will.
3,confusing but convincing,"Magnesen is probably a great detective and FBI agent, but he gets a C grade for organization and writing. The book was difficult to follow; as were the characters. One thing that would have helped immensely would have been to put a list of key players and their job/title descriptions at the end so we could refer to the list when the people would be mentioned in later chapters. However, his purpose in writing was not intended as great literature, but to convince readers that Dummar is not a kook. And, he did succeed in doing that because I did put the book down feeling like the ""Mormon Will"" could be real. Magnesen discovers some very convincing evidence that did not come out in the trial or was not pursued.If you are intrigued by Howard Hughes, add this book to your list."
3,"I maybe wouldn't put this on my favorites list, but...","""Bad Faith"" was interesting enough to hold my attention. Iliked most of the characters - even the sheriff once he stoppedonly being angry about the past. The author did a good jobof introducing and explaining bits of things about what goes onin a convent, and why some women still choose to live the lifeof a nun."
2,Maybe an OK for a first novel.,"Implauible and writen to be made into a movie, this mystery jumped to conclusions before there were possibilities, and these conclusions were disappointing."
4,Love Sister Agatha,"I loved this first book of a mystery series featuring a nun as the amateur detective. I loved reading about Sister Agatha herself, who in addition to being a nun, is a feisty, motorcycle-riding, mechanically inclined woman who was formerly a teacher and investigative reporter. I also loved the setting, Sister Agatha's isolated convent in an old farmhouse in New Mexico, and I adored the German Shepherd police dog who assigned himself the task of protecting Sister Agatha and her cloister. That there was a mystery to solve was just icing on the cake. I look forward to reading more in the series."
4,Sister Agatha is a Sleuth,"I discovered this series by serendipity recently, on the shelf of my local bookstore. When I saw that the main character is a nun, Sister Agatha, who drives a classic Harley Davidson motorcycle with her German Shepherd retired police dog in the sidecar, I had to read it.Sister Agatha is an extern nun, who deals with the public for the cloistered nuns in the small monastery, Our Lady of Hope.This book has a mystery to solve and gave me a welcome peek into how cloistered nuns live, so I can understand a bit about the beauty of their vows and way of life. Meanwhile Sister Agatha tools around the countryside as she tries to solve a murder in the monastery, and she even braves a biker bar to rescue someone.I look forward to the second book ""Thief in Retreat."""
5,A new detective figure,"Here is another good new detective figure in a genre which currently stresses the interesting character of a non-conventional detective. Good story well told by two good authors, who I hope will write a lot more about Sister Agatha and her New Mexico world."
4,Bad Faith,I really enjoyed this book and Sister Agatha was so human and with a sense of humor. I could just visualize her in her habit driving the Harley with Pax in the side car.
2,Pretty but doesnt take even a gentle washing,It is very pretty but the quilt and doesn't even take a gentle washing. The patchwork tears apart. Went through three quilts because I did not want to redo the room.
5,Not for the average gamer,"To those of you who are looking for a quick and easy game to play without any real time commitment or those who are looking to just blow something up, leave the page and dont waste your money.I first bought this game when it came out years and years ago and it is still more detailed and difficult than most of the newer and more advanced flight simulators out there. Of course there are a few glitches even with the latest patch but what game doesnt have them. There is going to be a huge time commitment in this game when it comes to the campaigns. Some missions can take up to an hour just to get to the target area, once there you might spend five minutes of actual combat or nothing at all only to fly another hour home. It is the closest thing to real life you are going to get without signing up. Enjoy!!"
5,The only sim you would ever need,"Well what can i say but this is the best game.First of alleverything about the game is so accurate except for a few things.Youmay need the patches but that just improves the game by so much. I know real pilots that say the game is so accurate that it is scary.If you think about buying janes f-18,don't even think about it,i bought it right when it came out and played it twice and put it back in the box wishing i never bought it.That game is not even close to accurate."
2,Flawed perfection,"First off get the current patch (1.08). Without it Falcon 4 is a buggy dung heap. Second the system requirements are too low. Start with the ""HOT"" system. Anything less will be anticlimactic. Patched and running on a HOT system, Falcon 4 is the beautiful, challenging, and exhilerating. At max resolution it is stunning.The training engagements should be considered a requirement; the SAMs are deadly, the enemy aircraft intelligent, and the flight model is unforgiving. I have yet to be able to use the most realistic avionic settings; Some day. This is a fantastic example of a pure hardcore flightsim. I love the challenge. This one has finally pushed EF2000 off my hard drive.By the way I would have given the game 5 stars if it had been released in its current patched version. It's a shame we wind up doing playtesting for companies."
4,A awsome sim but hard!,"I've played a lot of flight sims, but Falcon gains most of my respect and time. Falcon 4.0 truely lives up to its name of the most realistic flight sim around. The game gives you an adrenaline because of the realism and the power of a fighter in your hands. Excellent graphics and sounds. Physics is without question the best ever. The downside to Falcon is that it takes a lot of time and energy to learn. Besides having a 600 page manual(which you have to read in order to play), the game is hard to get used to. Especially landing, which took me a long time to learn. Bottm line: once in a life time game, but be prepared to be irratated"
2,Falcon 4.0,"This game is very impressive at first sight featuring stunning graphics and realistic gameplay. However, the campaign is full of bugs and almost impossible to really play. Microprose has put out patches but they haven't fixed anything. This is a cool game, but it needs some work"
3,So-so game.,"For those of you wanting a good Flight sim. Turn to Jane's.I am a Hardcore Flight Simmer. Flight Sims even convienced me to join the NAVY AVIATION. But this game's graphics are rather sad. I mean I have a serous system 600MHZ P3, 128MB ram, 32MB VideoRAM Nvida GeForce card. Well enough about my system. Back to the game. The Flight modeling is good but the Game in the nicest way possible Sucks. Spend your money on F/A-18, Usaf, or Flanker 2.0 if you are a hardcore flight simmer looking for a new game for the arsenal. Take my Military Honor on it."
1,Not up to today's standards,"Compared to other simulations that were on the market when Falcon came out, this game truely did not measure up. Especially after Jane's F/A-18. It was and still is buggy and slow running. Look at F/A-18, which runs beautifully and has crashed maybe once on me. Even Jane's F-15 with its older graphics is better and less buggy. Instead of this game, look into spending your money elsewhere...on something like Jane's F/A-18, or F-15."
5,Great Product,I had this AC adapter for a year and it still works.If you need an adapter for your super nintendo buy this.
3,Good Product,"This product works well, but it does have a tendency to not work every time you call on it to work."
3,Ac Adapter,"This adapter is great! You get to play all your classic heros. Without this you could not play the Super Nintedo. It is a shame they do not sell them in stores anymore. Now in are days you have to order them off the internet. The super nintendo is one of the first game systems, but the adapter looks like our day adapter. It might have some old parts in it, but it still works.This game system might be old, but it is great!"
2,"It's short and ""little""","This book is small, smaller than a passport. To the seller's defense they list the size of the book, but how many times do you check the height & width. I agree with another review, it will take 5 minutes to read this. The content is what you would expect but way too short, two jokes a page."
3,My little miracle wasn't that impressed with it.,My mother had purchased this for my youngest daughter when she was born. It wasn't up for long since if I would forget to turn it off she would kick it in the middle of the night and it would start ooohing and aaahing and wake her up. Oh well. It's sitting in a bag with all the rest of her baby stuff. I like the old kind of busy boxes they used to have (or perhaps they still make them).
4,My baby really likes this toy,"This toy keeps my son entertained in his crib for about 15 minute stretches-- just long enough for me to take a shower or wake up a little bit before I go pick him up in the morning. He loves the moving smiley face and the music, but he doesn't seem particularly interested in the other parts of the toy(mirror, ladybug, colored shapes)."
1,SHAME ON AMAZON.COM,"I SPECIFIED ONLY BAUSCH & LOMB AREDS, WHICH I MUST TAKE FOR MY EYES. TO MY SURPRISE HERE WAS A NEW 240 COUNT BOTTLE FROM AMAZON AT A COMPETITIVE PRICE. I USUALLY WOULD ORDER ONE OR TWO OF THE 150 GELS. I JUMPED AT THE OFFER. NEVER AGAIN. IT TURNS OUT THIS IS A NON-COMPETITIVE PRODUCT. AMAZON DOESN'T TELL YOU THE TABLETS ARE HALF POTENCY. THUS THEY ARE ONLY THE EQUIVALENT OF 120 GELS. FOR THE SAME DOSAGE YOU NEED FOUR PER DAY. BUY ONE OF THE 150 GEL PRODUCTS. SHAME ON AMAZON FOR NOT PROVIDING POTENCY INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SHOPPER TO MAKE AN INTELLIGENT PURCHASE.JAMES CORRIGAN"
1,What they didn't tell you,"I thought the contents would be an inexpensive version of the same B&L Preservision pills that I had prviously always and only seen advertised and purchased: small gels of which two were to be taken daily, one in morning, one in evening. The vials of this version contain large tablets, of which 4 are to be taken daily, 2 in morning, 2 in evening. I have to cut each tablet in half and can only manage to swallow the two pieces of one tablet at a time. The apparent bargain price is misleading because the information provided in the advertising is incomplete (does not give recommended dosage or nature of the tablets compared with the gels)."
5,Product as Expected,I bought this medicine for my mother who has macular degeneration. I found a good price at Amazon (or their affiliates) and the product was delivered as promised and the expiration date was one year away (expired medicine is a common problem in this type of purchase). I was satisfied with my purchase.
4,purchasing eye vitamins,"Amazon had the product I was looking for, and sold it to us at a competitive price. It arrived in a timely fashion."
3,noticed a bit of difference,"I bought these bills coz my right eye sight was bothering me. It was a bit blurry and irritated and my doctor recommended I buy these vitamins.I take these vitamins daily, but not sure if they helped with anything. My eye vision is a bit better, but I also sleep a lot more now, which I think is the main reason for the improvement.Also, the recommended dosage on the bottle is 4 bills. However, taking 4 bills give you 573% of Vitamin A, 753% of Vitamin C, 1333% of vitamin E and 464% of Zinc. Now, I am not a doctor, but I think anything in excess is not good. So, I only take 2 bills a day."
5,Must use product,Preservation is the best vitamin to preserve and protect eye health specially to decrease complaints due to aging.
3,suggestion for your TV commercials,"I just have one suggestion for your commercials. I notice that all your videos are with people with blue eyes; get real, there are also millions of brown eyed people who use your product. TOO MANY BLUE EYES!sylviacooke2@comcast.net"
2,OK but just OK,Saw is OK for the price. Glad I didn't pay more. Blade does not cut PVC very good. Takes a lot of effort to get through even small diameter pieces.
2,horsing around is cheap,"This is a cute set BUT it's frustrating and cheaply made. The legs on the dolls fall off constantly. We've had to tape them together. My almost 6 year old just gives up after a bit. Her friend came over to play and was so angry at the dolls she wanted me to return them immediately. Because the legs fall off all the time the clothes are impossible to put on. Also, the hats don't stay on, the saddles don't stay on. Expensive for what you get."
5,"Ring, Ring!","As a lover of Chick Lit, I must say this book has been one of my favorite reads of the summer! A great book to take to the beach, the mountains, or anywhere you go to relax! Fun, light and adventuresome Kathryn Cheet will steal you heart and make you smile!A great story full of romance, savy tension, and humor. Anna Davis has outdone herself with the tale of a single, cheating, london cab drive! Kathryn is sure to be a character you will remember for a long time to come!"
3,A pretty good read for the light-hearted,"This book features a slightly neurotic young woman cabbie in London who juggles her many lovers by using different colored cell phones. Each lover has their own sub-story and at times it gets difficult to keep them all straight. (Imagine how she must've felt!) The duration of the set-up of the characters was a bit long, but once I got to know each person individually, I found that I was hooked. It then kept me interested and wanting to know more. I liked following her journey to a more stable life, as she learned from each of her experiences. Overall, it's a good read for sitting by the pool or at the beach."
3,You can't walk two (or even six) roads at once successfully,"Reading the back cover, you'd expect the book to be a perfect summer read: a fluffy bit of chick-lit featuring a take-charge British cab driver and her five, then six, lovers. Once you get into it, though, there are some surprisingly deep themes running through the work, from the morality of polyandry to the many well-springs of self-destructive behavior. The problem is that the book isn't even 300 pages, and the author tries to tackle too much while ostensibly keeping the whole within the realm of a decent summer read. Anna Davis should have stuck with keeping the book light and fun or should have made a go of a serious bit of fiction, but trying to do both leaves the reader with a sour taste at the end. I don't regret reading the book, but on the other hand it could have been much better."
3,If you like Bridget Jones' Diary...,This has a similar feel to it. At least it starts out that way but does get more complex as the story and characters develop. It's a good summer read; the characters are engaging and there is more depth than initially meets the eye. Kathryn Cheet is a London cabbie with 5 lovers. She takes none of them lightly and cares deeply about each as each fulfills some missing part of her. A sixth man throws a wrench into her life and you'll just have to read it to find out what happens. Not as clearcut as it might sound.
3,Watch out,"I appreciate having Aloni's books in my catering collection. They are full of useful information and have a delightful tone. Watch out for the recipe for Sun-Dried Tomato and Pesto Torta. The quantities for the tomato and pesto layers appear not to be correct. I suggest doubling them. I used a 2-quart souffle dish to form the torta; there was barely enough pesto & tomato for one layer of each. Consequently I wasted a lot of time having to double back and make more of these two layers, including another trip to the grocery store. I'm trusting that the dish will be attractive and tasty as described by the author but ""easy"" is not a word that applies here. I wonder if this recipe was scaled down from a large quantity (you can't make just one of these for Neiman Marcus), thus the quantities are messed up a bit."
4,Major Shortcoming,"I think this is an excellent choral recording but both selections offered suffer from the failure of Chandos to include the full words to the score so that the listener can appreciate, for example, the war poems of Binyon that formed the basis for Elgar's Spirit of England work. This seems to be a common fault today. For a full price recording the program notes should include any libretto. Most might be familiar with the words to Land of Hope and Glory but are unlikely to know any of the other words to the Coronation Ode.I would pay more for that information if cost is the Chandos problem."
1,What We Expect From Chandos,I cannot agree too strongly with the previous reviewer who complains of the lack of texts with this release. This kind of shoddy documentation is what we have come to expect from Chandos. I bought this disc several years ago and trawl the Internet from time to time in search of the words to the Coronation Ode but so far to no avail. Chandos have no excuse as their author (A.C. Benson) died in 1925 so presumably all his works have long since entered the public domain.
1,DO NOT buy this bench!,"I bought this bench from Hugger Mugger 10 yrs ago and it has been great. I recently bought another one assuming it would be the same quality. Sadly, it is not. The current version is inferior. The wood is not finished, the hinges are small and cheap and do not secure the legs properly. In fact, one hinge was loose and the other was misplaced so that leg doesn't open and set properly. I have no problem if a company raises the price to maintain quality but don't raise the price and lower the quality."
5,Hugger Mugger Meditation Bench,"Hugger Mugger Meditation Bench (Plum)I LOVE THIS BENCH!! I have experienced severe hip pain during extended meditations on a traditional cusion. Using a bench has eliminated that. One of the reviews of this product complained that it was squeaky, however, mine has not had that problem. It is lightweight and easy to carry, and the removable cusion is very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,GREAT Bench!,"This is a wonderful product - exactly what I needed, and with the carrying case and foldable legs, it is perfect for travel and trips to parks. The legs are absolutely solid when extended fully, and the cushion is comfortable for over an hour. I highly recommend."
5,I liked it a lot,"I felt it wasn't too badly priced and when you are sitting for a while meditating, it's great idea to switch positions and it was good enough to give my legs some relief."
5,A very helpful prop,"If there were any negative aspects of this bench previously, they have been corrected. The hinges are sturdy and the edges are sanded nicely. The angle is perfect for sitting meditation. The pad is a nice addition. It has made it possible for me to sit comfortably in meditation for whatever period I choose. Indispensable."
4,with metta,"Purchased this bench for my husband's meditation retreat because he cannot sit for a long while. He did need to sand down the legs a touch to make the fit snug, but he has been very happy with it."
5,I'm very pleased.,"I saw this game at a toy store and thought it might be fun for my kids, ages 6 and 5. After I bought it, I looked on Amazon for reviews and was dismayed to see that others had had problems with it. I decided to keep it anyway and gave it to my kids this Christmas. It did take a while to assemble, but we made sure to put it all together exactly as instructed. To my relief, when we played it, we had none of the problems the other reviewers described. The parts all fit together securely, nothing fell apart, and the ball rolled around exactly as it should. We had lots of fun with the game and I'm looking forward to playing it again."
4,Excellent Materials Use,Another fun reference to find ways to use materials all around us to make fun art and structures. Fun way to play in the winter.
2,Making Bentwillow Trellises,"I was disappointed in this book. Mostly illustrations , not any actual photos.I definitely would not have purchased if I known this."
5,outstanding performance and recording,These are two of my favourite Sibelius symphonies and both received outstanding performances and recordings. Strongly recommended.
4,"The #2 OP43, most emotionally evocative",The transitions in the #2 Op. 43 are managed with distinctness and clarity and yet their subtlety is maintained. This is an exquisite recording.
1,Aluminum tube material getting into toothpaste,I started noticing the gray color from the metal making up the tube body in the clear paste and in the tube cap and ended up squeezing the toothpaste out into another container - don't want my precious pet getting a dose of Aluminum everyday with the teeth brushing!! Didn't anyone else notice this???
3,Yuck! Not for my cat.,"Don't know how effective this toothpaste is in preventing plaque because my cat would not try it. I even tried to put it in her mouth, figuring she might not mind after tasting it. Anyhow, she still hated it. Oh well, still trying to find an alternative to brushing her teeth (which is impossible to do!)."
4,Easy brushing.,"My two dogs love the chicken flavor.I lightly brush it onto their teeth before bed.They look forward to it as an evening ""snack"".After spending a fortune on a full cleaning, this has maintained their teeth pretty well and their gums show no signs of redness (17 months later).I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure the enzymatic type of toothpaste obviates the need for much in the way of mechanical brushing, which the dogs don't like.Downside: the metallic tubes are really hard to squeeze once the paste is almost gone.Edit: I tried the Vanilla-Mint flavor too. I like how it makes my dogs breath smell for their good-night kisses, but they don't like the taste as well."
3,Beware of Shipping Charges,C.E.T. toothpaste in the poultry flavor Buddy (dog) seems to love the flavor. He likes it so much that it's hard to brush his teeth due to him being so busy eating it. The two cats don't mind it too much. I gave it 3 stars only due to the shipping. You could purchase it at a vets office for a little less or the same price without waiting for the product to arrive. After you add the cost of product and shipping charges. They ship it by mail and it can't possibly cost $5.95 for mailing a small package.
5,Cat loves the flavor!,Bought this to use with the pet dental finger brush my four paws. My cat absolutely loves it and starts licking as soon as it gets near him!
5,Keeps your cat or dog's teeth clean,"My two cats love this toothpaste.Granted, they might not like the act of brushing, but after I let them lick a little of it first, they are more willing to let me brush their teeth.I don't like using toothbrushes with my cats; instead, as my vet recommended, I use some gauze wrapped around my finger which allows me better access to the rear teeth.It's best if you can brush your pet's teeth daily (although I am not a vet, so use this advice at your own risk), and this toothpaste makes it a bit more pleasant for them."
2,less ( or No) sugar version please!!,"I've been using C.E.T. toothpaste for my dog. but it doesn't have to be that sweet. I tasted it myself, it was too much sweet. Please make less or No sugar version for many consumers."
5,Dogs love the taste,Dogs love this product! They get so happy when it's time to brush their teeth. Fast shipping. Good price.
5,my cat loves it!!,"great product, great company. always receive it fast! my cat loves to brush his teeth, thanks to the great flavors!"
1,5 stars for Frampton and his band on this night - Zero stars for this DVD version,"A great, fun performance by Frampton and his backing trio is marred by awful DVD mastering. The audio constantly changes volume levels. The disc kicks off promisingly with Frampton's sole guitar scorching through the amps, but when the rest of the band's instruments join him, the volume of the DVD shifts. This happens throughout the two-hour concert, making it unlistenable. The camera work is a bit too frantic at times, but I could forgive that, had the DVD's audio been mastered at the same sound level throughout the video. But it's not, and it's a shame. It pains me to write this, because Frampton is such a wonderful, underrated musician. I think he sounds better on this DVD than he did in the mid-1970s, and he sounds even better today. Check out PBS's ""Sound Stage"" concert with Frampton on TV. The guy is a beast on the guitar.Hopefully Universal/Hip-O will remaster this DVD with consistent audio levels."
4,This isn't as bad as other reviewers make out but...,"This is actually a very spirited performance with some excellent playing from Peter and the band. The video is cut very fast in the 90s MTV video style. I did get the same sound track issues when I played the DVD on my computer in both stereo and Dolby 5.1 downmix. And obvious mastering issue. However, when I play it on my home theater system in DTS 5.1 it sounds perfect. So if you have DTS 5.1 available this is a great addition. I also have the Detroit concert and I think this is pretty much equal in performance, but the Detroit is the better first buy."
4,"A++++++ Audio & Performance, B- Video. Very good overall!","Peter Frampton and his band are still playing at a very high level of energy and technical proficiency. This concert DVD is easily worth twice the $10 I paid for it at Walmart. The sound is outstanding and is in Dolby Surround. The concert is set at the legendary Filmore in San Fransisco. It has an intimate, classy feel, but the hall holds enough people and has good enough accoustics to give the concert that ""big"" feel that is lacking in certain smaller venues. Frampton feeds off of the crowd and the crowd responds. This same dynamic made the original ""Frampton Comes Alive"" album rock and roll history.The only slight downgrade I give it is for the video. It's sometimes a little amateurish, but at other times it's fine.Overall, this is an outstanding concert with superb sound quality and a wonderful artist-to-crowd relationship. It actually sent tingles down my spine, and gave me a rush from the past!"
2,Disappointing,"I have always enjoyed Frampton's work, but was disappointed with this dvd. Though there are some good performances from Peter and the band, I don't feel this is their best performance. I own quite a number of concert dvds; and this one ranks very low. The lighting and sound quality are not great, and the video editing is the worst I've ever seen, as noted in other reviews. I own Live In Detroit on audio c.d. and I feel that is a better performance. I will probably buy that DVD in hopes that it is better."
3,Too loose.,"Positive: the case looks nice, and the magnetic clasp works well. The lanyard strap is handy.Negative: the leather is stiff, making it hard to keep open. The case is too LOOSE and my nano keeps sliding sideways out of it. Whenever I open the case up to change the volume, I have to readjust the nano to align with the openings. This is my first nano case, so I don't know if they all have this problem. It's usable, just annoying."
3,"Great protection and style, no access to dock port","The Belkin case looks very stylish and is not bulky, but the problem is that you can't access the dock port so every time you need to charge your Nano you have to take it out of the case, which is not very simple. If this doesn't trouble, get this case. I'm going to return it and get a different one."
4,Very entertaining and well made,The story and special effects are appropriately placed to move this fast-paced action filled fantasy martial arts epic along. I really enjoyed everything about this movie.It is simply a good film to have in your library.
1,Ugh!,"The locations and scenery is breathtaking. However, I didn't get a feel for the love between the main characters and their pain at having to fight each other. In fact, all the characters didn't portray any depth or real emotion. Maybe this is due to the actors or the fact that the special effects are the real stars of the show. I thought the computer-generated imagery was moderate at best and quite numerous. This movie had real potential but failed in that they didn't develop realistic and believable characters. The characters were nothing but skilled in fighting with powers."
3,Decent For The Right Price,This movie for me was a bit of a let down now that is not to say that it was completely terrible and there is no likability here but honestly I was expecting WAY more than what I got. I think I would have been way more impressed with this movie had I not ever seen Basilisk or if the movie had followed that storyline a bit more closely but since I have I kept getting the feeling like this movie was lacking because it didn't really bring anything intensely original to the story nor did it play to fans of the series so it was kind of in the middle. I have to say that the ending 20 to 30 minutes are probably the best but for the most part it just seemed like Japan wanted an excuse to put Ayumi Hamasaki in a movie. Considering it is done by Funimation (who also produces Basilisk) I wasn't expecting too much so I bought it from a second hand vendor for way cheaper than Amazon's listing price. All in all I say save your self the time and just buy Basilisk.
5,Enchanting movie,"The action is great, the characters interesting, and the visuals are stunning.The story has been done before, but that can be forgiven. While not on par with the production values of The Hero, or House of Flying Daggers, it is a very good movie that lovers of the genre should not miss."
4,nice action flick,"A somewhat predictable Japanese film, the cinematography and animation is fun. If you like X-men and/or tragedies this film is for you."
2,Ok at best,"This is an ok movie, but I would hesitate recommending to buy it unless you get it used for really cheap. The visuals fall well short of Hero or HoFD, so don't expect that and the story is pretty absurd, with basically the characters from two hidden villages having a ""fight-off"" from their respective top 5 fighters. These characters all have super-hero like powers such as the ""unstoppable eye technique"" that are laugh out loud absurd. They try to finish the movie with some kind of moral note by the girl leader gouging out her eyes with a three stooges eye poke that will have you seriously looking around the room to make sure nobody has seen you watching this movie.If you like outrageous silliness, this may be an ok movie to rent just to laugh at, otherwise it's a tough sell."
4,"Great Movie, Awesome Visuals!",Shinobi is a visually stunning movie in all it's Blu Ray glory. A must own for kung fu enthusiasts.
2,Pretty wack,"Pretty because its on Blu but wack cause of the movie itself. Some action scenes are good, but I suggest you rent or borrow from someone before purchasing this one. One thing that stood out to me was how is this supposed to be a action-romatic rip-off of romeo and juliet and not have the main characters even kiss? Not even a peck, LOL."
2,Shinobi,"This movie wasn't as great as it was hyped up to be. In my opinion it was short and lacked an interesting story. Only thing I did some what like in about movie was the powers that each of them had, other than that it was a cheezy love/action movie."
2,"Nice to look at, but...","Having seen the posters for this movie near the Castle in Iga-Ueno, Mie Prefecture (one of the two actual home towns of Japanese Ninjitsu), I had unrealistically high hopes for it. This flick has nothing to do with real ninjitsu. It's an attempt to cross an Asian Epic/Love Story in the spirit of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".. with ""video game"" ninjas who possess ridiculous magical powers and colorful costumes. I suppose it might have been a better movie if it had just been one or the other. Pity, because the lead actors (Odagiri Jo and Nakama Yukie) are pretty good and deserved a better movie. History buffs might note that some of the politics hinted-at in Sunpu Castle are pretty accurate. The CGI version of Sunpu-Jo was pretty interesting in itself, but hardly worth the price of a DVD."
3,Shinobi - Heart Under Blade,A pretty good movie overall but if you are a fan of the animation than you will be disappointed. Story line is a little bit different and the acting is ok.
2,If you need something to put you to sleep...,"This movie is terribly boring. I fell asleep twice during it. The fight scenes are too short. The CG used in the film is very cheap looking. The ""drama"" will cause you to roll your eyes. It's a B-movie that thinks it's a masterpiece...The 5.1 Japanese track is well done. The transfer for the R1 DVD is very good.There are much better Asian films out there."
3,Okay but anime version is better,"The movie was very good. But I did't like how they change the ending making Oboru want to kill her love. In the anime, they were more loyal to each other.Action was good. Thought characters were changed a little bit."
2,Shinobi,Fantastic picture quality and fantastic disappointing audio quality. I'm surprised the audio quality was below average. It would have been perfect............. awwwwww!
4,"until they have ninja scroll live, this will have to do","I dont know what came first Basilisk the anime or Shinobi this movie but they are essentially the same. One is just live and the other is anime. Don't let this cover fool you of what's inside. It is feudal sword play action packed anime come to life. Fantastic and creative fight scenes where face off characters are so strong in their respective arts it makes for good suspense of not knowing who will win. If you know what ninja scroll is and needed to fill that void since that classic, this is a good fix."
5,The Disney Keepsakes,"This is one of the best Disney books I have ever had the pleasure to own. It's beautifully done and a treat for anyone interested in Disney, both old and new. Buy it, borrow it, just get your hands on one as soon as you can."
5,"Best pouring aid, bar none.",These will not drip and will pour in a smooth flowing stream. The dual lip design returns the final drip back to the bottle. They will last about two years before the cracking gets to the point of replacement. I am a second time buyer and will buy again.
2,Sorta works but fragile,One of the two stoppers that we had cracked within a week and the other one has hairline cracks all in the plastic and sometimes pops out of the bottle by itself and doesn't stay in.
2,Budiansky does not accomplish his goal,"The author tries to bring both the biography of Walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together in the same book and succeeds at neither. It is a fine read if you would like a general overview of the time, but, after reading the title and reviews, I was hoping for a detailed biography of Walsingham or much detail on how he created the group of people who became his information gatherers. Instead, it is a general overview of Walsingham's life with references to the work that he did. There are some interesting facts that the author brings forward that the reader might not find elsewhere , but the majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of Elizabeth I. If you want details and a better understanding of Walsingham the man, and his life work and actions, you will need to look elsewhere."
4,Elizabeth I and her protectors.,"I think this is a good book due to how spycraft has affected today's world. Great powers spy on one another, and often use elements to usurp a country's ruler and his/her authority. France, Spain, and the Papacy certainly tried to overthrow Elizabeth I. Since England's change in religion, the rulers tried to forment plans to kill and throw out Elizabeth. Walsingham used unorthodox methods of ferreting out these rebels to destroy these elements. His trap for Mary the Queen of the Scots showed what methods he was willing to do to ensure that his sovereigh Elizabeth retained her crown.I think this is a solid read on the early uses of spycraft in influencing a nation's affairs. It shows that intelligence is a necessity of all states."
4,Fascinating life of one of key Elizabethan power broker,"I love stories about Elizabeth's political times, because of what they show about the birth of England's non-royal civil service class, and I love spy stories. Walsingham was a) honest b) a non-bigoted, loyal Protestant c) a brilliant administrator and diplomat and d) a brave man when advising his Queen. What's not to love about this story?"
2,Thin and forgetable,"If you are looking for an interesting, illuminating book about the Elizabethan ""police state,"" keep looking. This shortish book is light on details and lacks good sourcing. I was hoping, with a biography about someone whose fingers were in every Elizabethan pie, who knew, figuratively and literally, where all the Elizabethan bodies are buried, we'd have a sort of unified field theory of the Age in the offing. Alas, no. Just a little book with little ambition."
3,"her majesty's spymaster: Elizabeth I, Sir Francis Walsingham",interesting but did not reveal enough about the man. read recommendations before I bought book and that is how I made my choice.
2,Let us look elsewhere for guidance.,"Mr. Budiansky proposes that Elizabeth's spymaster Francis Walsingham offers us an example for conducting modern espionage. Yet the fact is, Elizabethan England was for all practical purposes a police state. Catholicism was deemed treasonous, and Walsingham's spies combed the countryside for practitioners of the ""old religion,"" i.e., the faith that had been the taproot of English civilization for a thousand years. Catholics were barred from serving in Parliament, attending university, worshipping at Mass, and generally living the life their immediate forebears took for granted. And yet Budiansky holds up this tragedy as a model. Let us look elsewhere for guidance."
2,Super Sound for 30 minutes,"I am very impressed with the systems looks and the sound quality was very good, but... I only played the system for about 30 minutes when I went back one week later to turn it on the system was on constant sleep mode. I did call the Phillips help line they were helpful to get me a return authorization but I had to pay the shipping $21. I am looking forward to getting the system back with no bugs in it this time."
1,Should be banned from earth!!,"This is the worst product i have ever used.Iam a drummer and needed this for a few shows.Tapes get eaten and cds dont play. I had to spend $61to send it back the way it came UPS.I have been told I will get a working replacement...We can only hope and dream this will come true.Sincerely hoping to jam soon,Dr. Bill"
1,Do Not Buy This!,"Our stereo was defective. The remote worked intermittently, the oprn/close button for cds did not work; and the cd player would not play- it just kept saying ""reading disk""."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this book from a book club, sight unseen, and I thought from the title that it would be a bit simpler. Well, I was wrong. The projects in the book are ones that I would never use. She doesn't really cover garment construction, except for a gaudy looking child's sundress. Then the materials you have to buy are a bit pricey. The only thing I really liked about the book was that it had great photos. I think the book ""Sew Fast Sew Easy"" is better than this. This book will just collect dust on my bookshelf."
4,interesting look at Spain,"Polly Evans offers a mostly engaging look at Spain. I felt that the book gave a good, accurate look at what it is like to visit Spain and enter it's culture. Some was appealing, other parts, like the punitive attitude toward mistakes, did not make a longterm visit to Spain appealing. I found the book useful in my decision on what country to plan a long term trip to. I also enjoyed Polly's struggles with a long bike trip, and her perseverance. She shares the good and the bad, and what it's really like. She does not whitewash the country or herself. An honest read. I read the book, and sold it, but would buy it again if I was considering a trip to Spain in the future."
2,Nonstop whining and complaining,"I bought this book after my own journey through Spain. At first I enjoyed it, thinking that she had some bad luck running into a few grumpy people, but it became an increasingly annoying theme that according to her everyone in Spain is rude, stupid, and/or fat and every place is dull and boring. I quote from the end of the book: ""another drab dive in another dull town."" Other tourists are also stupid and fat, and sometimes pimply. Sites that have left others breathless bore her to tears, and she thinks people meet in the plazas because they have nothing to do. I started to question her language skills as well as her eyesight.I find it astounding that she could travel 1600 miles on bicycle and eat every meal in a public place and not strike up a single friendship or even a single interesting conversation, but her snarky attitude and condescending assumptions are revealing. Unless you're looking for an excuse to get out of a trip to Spain, I'd skip this."
1,"Its Not About Spain, Its All About Polly","A good travel memoir is a wonderful compliment to a vacation and I looked forward to reading It's Not About the Tapas during our recent ten day visit to Spain. Fortunately our experience was 180 degrees different from my Polly Evans account of her bike ride through rural and urban areas of Spain. She is so cynical and sarcastic in describing her travels that I doubted the credibility of the historical facts presented as well. Fortunately, I enjoyed my visit to Spain much more than I enjoyed reading Its Not About the Tapas."
3,I got what I needed...,I got what I needed from this book but I was disappointed at Polly Evans' observations about the people along the way. In some cases her comments about people are rude and did not add value to the book. I needed an idea of a reasonable bike route through Spain and she accomplished this plus added enough history to make interesting points about the areas she visited.
5,Endless Terror...and LOVING it!,"Instantly engrossing from the time it's picked up, GOTHIC is the best comprehensive study of the real gothic culture from the invasion of Eurpoe to present day. This book should be extremely interesting to anyone who studies literature or European history."
5,THe athority on the history of Gothic,This book is wonderfully extensive covering everything from Elizabeth Bathory to The Cure. It would prove useful to both modern Goths and literary scholars. This is a one of a kind resource that you will keep referring back to. It is the single most useful book on my book shelves.
5,What a Buy,"First of all I have not used this caulking gun. But I know it will be a welcome addition to my tool wall. I was looking for a reasonably inexpensive caulking gun for a few repairs. I did not need a high powered gun. I set my price range for $10-$15, including shipping. I the final price was under $10 and I got a good deal. It has a nice weight to it. The materials are solid and the function is fluid. It even has a built in spout cutter. This tool will serve the weekend fixer to the local handyman as well as the pro."
1,Bad monkey,I am afraid I feel it my duty to disagree with the previous review. I found this book most unhelpful when visiting the zoo! None of the monkeys seemed to exist - perhaps it is all fictional!
5,good product,this was a great product for the price i bought it for... was easy to install and worked with no problems.hoping to see more great deals from this dealer
4,No preamp outputs.,I originally bought this headunit only to find that it had no preamp outputs. I would not recommend this product if you are planning on adding an amplifier to your sound system.
5,Th e older the better....,"I bought this dvd on a lark... It is worth it. Great production, lavish sets... Rod is the only one in blue jeans.He looks starved. The babes are great.Get this at lowest price and enjoy. It is worth a watch."
1,Watch out,We got two copies of this show. It looks like it was great but both of them (from different sources) had lip sync. problems and honestly I cannot stand to watch that....it never corrected itself. The first refunded the money without us sending it back. The second demanded it be returned for a refund....cost more than it was worth to send it back. we still have it....want a copy?
3,True to Hindemith's vision,"This is the version of 'Mathis' that I grew up with. Horenstein's interpretation is fairly perfect in my opinion, vastly superior to Karajan's dirge-like exercise, particularly in the area of tempi. It's a pity the mastering on this disk isn't better; inner detail is frequently lacking and the stereo placement seems rather narrow. But still, it's all tied together by Horenstein's remarkable vision. I don't feel as well-equipped to review the Strauss work as I simply don't know it as well. On the classic LP of this pairing, the Hindemith was the featured work!"
1,Arrived Broken - Inside dimensions not the same as stated,"Item had large crack in bottom front corner upon arrival. Plastic must not be very strong for it to break in shipping. Also, the measurements are taken from up high in the middle of kennel. The floor space inside which is what the pet can use is 18 15/16 W x 29 3/4 L x 25 H as stated on the attached tag. Width given was 24 7/16 which you can see is almost 6 inches larger than the actual floor space. However, I really like the metal windows instead of plastic and all the metal bolts which held the top to the bottom. I did not purchase from Amazon so it's not thier fault at all and I was able to return it."
3,Warning - Not IATA Compliant,"Just a warning - this crate might abide by all FAA regulations, but if you're planning on using it to take your pet overseas, it does NOT meet IATA requirements. IATA requires that a crate have ventilation on all four sides. This crate does not have ventilation in the back.Additionally, IATA requires that ""For rigid plastic containers, the door hinge and locking pins must engage the container by at least 1.6 cm (5/8 in) beyond the horizontal extrusions above and below the door opening where the pins are fitted.""I realize that this is not advertised as IATA compliant, so I'm still giving it three stars because it seems well-made, but a little expensive."
1,Worst. Ghost. Rider. *Ever*,"This comic is so bad that upon reading it your skull will burst into flame and you will seek vengeance. Lame art, bad script. Save your money and avoid this accursed fate."
2,Like all the Marvel Knights Series.. not so good...,"When you had read the original Ghost Rider, The Punisher and the others characters who had been ""re-visited"" or ""re-make"" by the Marvel Knights Series you feel it's not the same.. The plot is good, but the graphics presents the Ghost Rider like a cartoon very funny not like the Spirit of Vengeance that is...Talks about a Johnny Blaze who works in a cubicle and wants to be free or the Ghost Rider...If you are a Spirit of Vengeance, better buy ""Ride of the Midnight Sons"" or ""Ghost Rider Resurrected""..."
4,Silverwing by Kenneth Oppel,Silverwing is an action packed book with a well described plot. In this story Shade is blown out to sea and lands on an island. He then meets his new friend Marina. They then decide that they must find shades colony and warn them about the owls closing down the sky before it is too late. On their journey they face many trials and difficulties on their way but never even think about giving up.This book is a good quick read. It has a great plot and exciting character. It would be great for anyone over ten. This story has an exciting plot and a meaningful theme; this is a very well written story. I think that the theme was very clear in this story. This book is one of few that have a great plot and theme.
5,WOW the craziest china man out there!!!!!,Wow this has got to be one of Jackie Chan's top performances! This peice is NOTHING compared to any of his other works! Only one word to describe this movie and it's FREAKINCRAZY!! If your an alcoholic with a sense of humour this is the movie to watch!!!!!! If your a martial artists with a taste in style this is also the movie! i've never seen anything like it... it's like the chinese version of the Matrix... I'm tellin you it must be the GINSENG heheheh Overall this movie was great... the scenes were always packed with action etc... never a boring scene
4,Good version.,"I love Jackie Chan and the Drunken Master movies. I originally saw Drunken Master II a few years prior to its American re-release as Legend of the Drunken Master (the version I saw was released by Tai Seng, I believe) and when I watched Legend in the theater, I couldn't understand why they cut the very end of the movie out. There was a whole scene afterward where Jackie has gone cuckoo from drinking the industrial alcohol. It was pretty much Jackie clowning around, but, when I finally wanted to buy the movie for my collection, all I could find was the edited, Americanized Legend of Drunken Master. This release is the original Drunken Master II and this DVD, while not as high quality as the Legend DVD, is still very good. A must for Chan fans."
1,Outrageously High Price!,I guess I did not notice the price when I ordered these garbage bags. My bad. $7.79 for this product is highway robbery. Indeed I could have bought it in my local and very expensive supermarket in NYC for $3.99 or less. Amazon should not permit vendors to sell products with such inappropriately high prices. This practice does not fit well with Amazon's ethos and culture.
1,Rip-off,"I had this product already in my cart when I noticed the low rating. Curiosity led me to the reviews and the price!I quess I tend to get complacent and just click ""add to cart"". That is going to change. As other reviewers commented this kind of pricing is robbery! Also, Amazon should do more to control the vendors they allow to use their site. Amazon's reputation is also affected by this sort of thing.It's a lot cheaper to use the gas to drive to the supermarket! Today that's saying something.Glad Small Garbage Bags, 4 Gallon 30 bags"
1,Ridiculous Price,$36 + shipping ... are you kidding me. No one in their right mind will order 30 four-gallon bags for this ridiculous price!
4,Received what I ordered on a timely basis,"Not much to say about this product. It is what it is, and I received it on time. I bought it for my daughter for college to lock her laptop. Five stars for delivery compliance, three stars for the length of cable (could have been a bit longer)."
2,Looks nice and safe - but broke in two weeks!,"I can not say it is not safe - as long as it does work. But a moment ago when I picked it from my laptop bag and wanted to lock my laptop with it, I sadly found out that the lockhole was misplaced (God knows what had happened to it) and I could not fit my key in. OK they said they would have a life-time warranty but I hate such kind of trouble. I guess they could provide better product with such a price. Any way since it is a touch lock (I like the design very much) I could still give them 2 stars, but not more."
5,Kensington Key Lock,"Shipping was quick and packaging was very adequate for the product. The lock and cable appear to be of good quality. The keys work flawlessly and I prefer over the combination lock models. It was listed and purchased as a used item, but looks new and at half the cost of the new ones. How much abuse can a lock like this take? I have always had good success with purchasing used items through Amazon. If there is ever a problem, it is accepted back immediately."
2,"Hard to use, keys kinda big","Maybe it's just me, or where the locking slot is my docking station, but it's awfully hard to get the darned key to turn. You have to push in and compress the rubber ring to get the key to turn. Difficult in an awkward space. And the keys are biggish for use on a key chain. Ended up not using it for docking station use - will use it only when traveling, which means it'll rarely get used."
3,OK as a deterrent; loose fit in computer,"When installing the lock, the instructions are easy to follow once you get the hang of it, but one important detail is left out - there are two small metal pieces right next to the center lock mechanism. These have to aligned horizontally to the Kensington security port before putting the lock in place. This is common sense, perhaps, but it took me a few minutes to figure out what to do and how to do it. There are no written instructions so if you find the pictures confusing you could be lost.The lock fit surprisingly loosely into the security port... but this isn't exactly a good thing. Enough prying/pulling/jiggling of the lock would definitely damage the laptop.Like everyone here has already said, this lock is basically a deterrent. It won't work well as an actual theft spoiler, but a laptop left in public with this lock installed is probably a lot safer than one without."
4,Just what we were looking for.,"This cable lock is long enough, the cable is covered as to not scrape things, and the key is simple and effective. I had trouble the first few times trying to open it in the HP Pavillion, but it seemed it must have been the notebook, as the lock worked fine outside the computer. It works great, now, and at a really good price (compared to lesser locks even)."
4,Looped to bedframe,"I just got back from a two week vacation and I used this lock for the first time. I looked all over the place and aside from the plumbing under the sinks -- which didn't seem like a good idea -- the only place I could loop it to was the bedframe. This is in no way critical of the device; just you might want to consider what you're going to attach it to.The only flaw was a bit of a burr in the cable sticking through the plastic coating, which I filed down. You might want to inspect it when you take it out of the box so you don't get surprised and bleed all over the place.The cable is of course vulnerable if a thief has a substantial pair of cutters; I lost a bicycle locked with the same kind of cable many years back. But this seems like a good-enough product, considering that limitation."
4,Pretty Strong but pretty confusing too,"Pros:- Cable is very strong- Cable isn't bulky- Fits into my laptop- Long enough for me to use- Kensington has a registration process where if you loose your keys, they send you a new replacement set- Comes with a nice small rubber strap thing to wind the lock together when not in use- Sleek feel which doesn't bother the handsCons:- Difficult to lock because sometimes the piece right in front of the locking mechanism turns- The locking mechanism's location makes it a little difficult to insert the key properlyOverall the lock is great. It's a little difficult to lock because of the way it was constructed. Other then the difficulty locking it, the cable is awesome. It's very strong and bends easily so it can be anchored to something. I was very pleased with this lock and it does everything I needed/wanted it to do. I would definitely recommend this to a family member or a friend to use as well."
1,"Shoddy, poor quality","The cable itself is OK, but the lock is very poor quality. The internal mechanism on my lock unscrewed itself from the body of the lock after about six uses -- and no, it was not tampered with, or at least the anti-tamper mechanism had not been activated. This product is worth about $5 and does nothing more than avoid tempting honest people. I'm sure the proper tool would pop the lock out of the security port in two seconds."
1,"Tamper-Evident ""feature""","This lock has a ""Tamper-Evident"" feature. If the lock is tampered with the lock goes into ""lockdown"" mode, and the owner's key will not be able to open the lock.Here's what I was told by Kensington tech support:If anyone tries to open the lock without the proper key, using an alternate key or a pin, etc., the lock will go into ""lockdown"" mode. The company claims you need to hire a locksmith to open a lock once it's in lockdown mode, and they will reimburse you up to $80 of your expenses.This sounds insane to me. The lock should be hard for a thief to open. But I want to be able to open my own lock without professional assistance, even if someone tried to tamper with it."
5,Simple & effective.,"It does just what it says it'll do: if your PC has a locking slot (almost all do now) and the place where you're working has a secure piece of hardware to secure it the airplane-grade cable (schools, libraries, airports, et. al.), all would-be casual thieves will move on. As for more determined thieves, that's perhaps another story. Back up your data!"
4,works well enough,"Works well on my 27 inch iMac. It's secure enough for sure, but the attachment isn't tight against the computer. it has some jiggle room. doesn't look like this effects the security factor though."
4,"Solid construction, easy to use","This is a good product - it seams sturdy and it works well in the lock slot on my laptop. I was a little shocked at how much these cable locks cost, so that's the only drawback - but it works well for me."
1,Watch this video before you buy one,"Go to Google videos and search for ""how to pick kensington lock"". Maybe Kensington has improved the product since then. I don't know."
3,moves around a lot,"This product is easy to secure to the laptop, but it doesn't seem very secure. the lock moves around a lot and doesn't seem firmly locked. but the lock doesn't come out when i pull it, so it does work."
2,Ugh!,So not only could I not get this to work on my computer until two years after I purchased it but when i did get to attach it I had a really hard time unlocking it. I've only used this product once and wish I had not gotten it. The only good thing about the shipment was that I had no problems with the seller or timeliness of the shipment.
5,Notebook Lock,"We purchased this item because the normal, generic laptop locks did not work on the Macbook we had. It has worked well and we don't have to worry about our equipment 'disappearing'. A good quality for the cost and the vendor was very responsible."
4,Good protection in most settings,"Having had a laptop ""walk"" from my office desk, I purchased the Kensington lock for my next laptop and I have used this device in a variety of settings for the past 4 years. Now I can go to the bathroom without worry! While this device (or any other) will not stop the determined thief with unlimited time, the casual thief is much more common and troublesome. This device provides good security for the unattended laptop problem, as long as the environment is relatively secure...."
5,"Light, Effective, Laptop Security Solution","I have three of these and I'm pleased with them. I leave two laptops secured to the desk at all times and the third sits in my laptop backpack ready for travel. These are light, and simple to operate. No complaints. I've used the Kensington brand laptop cables for years - I think since they first came out. I lose them periodically but keep buying more. I highly recommend.As a bonus, it looks like the newer external hard drives are now being made with the laptop security ""hole/notch"" so you can secure these with the security cables also. Very nice. My new Seagate 500GB FreeAgent does for sure but I've seen the security features mentioned in reviews of other drives as well."
4,Works as advertised.,"I bought it to work on laptop being used to control an environmental chamber, and all I had to do was take it out of the package and implement it right away. The laptop was a few years old, and the lock fit in no problem, and the orientation of the wire off the lock rotates 360 degrees so there will never be a problem with the positon."
1,Frustrating to use,"I know how this lock is supposed to work and have gotten it to lock before, but it is so frustrating to use. I just spent 20 minutes wrestling with it, trying to get it to lock, with no success. Part of the lock is too loose to ensure that the lock securely locks the laptop. If you have a USB device plugged in, or if your laptop is angled such that it's facing you, the lock placement is awkward as well."
5,It works,"It's a good lock. The cable is much thicker than some other cheap locks, which would probably serve more as a deterrent than an actual safety measure. And it locks your computer, which is, of course, what you want."
5,There are locks and there is Kensington Lock,I do a lot of working travel and I'm always wary when I have to leave my laptop in the hotel room. A friend of mine had his stolen from the hotel room and the hotel took no responsibility for the loss. From that moment I decide that I needed a product with excellent reputation so after a good research over the internet I chose the Kensington 64068F Microsaver Notebook Lock and security cable. Of course a thief is a thief but if someone attempts to steal my laptop for sure they are going to have to carry the big desk from the hotel room together!
4,ok,Product does seem well made and so far has worked well. It is however slightly difficult to attach to my computer. It doesn't turn into the slot all that easily.
1,Don't buy if you have a mac,"I bought this to secure my mac while I was at my studio desk. It did not fit into my computer as the two prongs and the lock piece were not aligned. This is not a well made product. Avoid it if you can and you won't get charged for the shipping, regardless of the poor quality of craftsmanship."
1,Gone In 60 Seconds,"Be sure to catch all the videos on youtube of people unlocking these locks in under 60 seconds with a pen, toilet paper tube and a piece of tape."
3,Grand so it is.,Not a bother with it. Works fine and all that. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a computer lock. Bit pricey.
3,Quality is great but the lock is not unique,The lock and cable are very easy to use and feel sturdy. A friend of mine has the same lock and cable and out of curiosity I tried my key on her lock. My key was able to unlock it which led me to believe that the key is universal to this model of laptop lock.
4,"Kensington 64068F Notebook Lock & 13"" MacBook warpage","I read another post at a different site concerning warpage of the 13"" MacBook caused with this 64068F Kensington Microsaver notebook security lock. I read there is a fix--file the ""T"" bar down about one milimeter (about the thickness of a credit card) to correct the problem. I own a 13"" MacBook and an older version of this Kensington security lock and have no problems."
2,Not a do it yourself guide,"This book is good for parents of kids who are new to or in speech therapy but, it's not a do it yourself guide. I was hoping to, teach my child how to say it right. This book gives some background and helps a tiny bit but, it didn't help in the least with teaching my daughter how to say her ""r"" sounds properly. On the speech therapy I go. Save the 10$ to apply to your deductible unless you just really want to learn more about speech problems."
5,A great gift for new parents,"As a speech-language pathologist, I am often asked for suggestions for activities for encouraging speech and language skills. This book certainly provides that, plus many other important aspects of communication development. My favorite section is ""encouraging your child's interest in the printed word."" It presents a variety of ideas for parents to expose children to letters and sounds in a natural way, within the environment. A key area mentioned is to not stop reading to a child just because she can read.This book is a great ""new baby"" gift. It is not difficult to read and would be valuable to new parents, just in terms of developmental awareness."
2,give me a break.....Metal???,"This is not metal, it's old school rock and roll. Yes, it's all good music by very talented artists, but it is NOT Metal. It's not even heavy ROCK for pity's sake, yes, it's sappy ballads..."
4,Exactly what you'd expect,"If you review the track titles, that's all you need to know. The songs are all performed well. If the sound quality had been a little crisper, I'd have given it a 5th star."
3,"Call me cheesy, but....","....I really liked a lot of the songs on here in their acoustic form. This album definitely brought back memories of my childhood. I would never listen to the original version of these songs now as they are probably too loud for an old guy like me. I will say, however, that in their acoustic form, I liked a lot of these songs and, as I said they brough back a lot of memories. It was also fun to share some of these old songs with friends I grew up with.Matt Zarnstorff"
4,Metal Mania or is it...?,"While I enjoyed the CD I take exception to the title ""Metal Mania."" I find it difficult to catagorize these bands as ""metal,"" they're more 80s hair bands. As for the music... I really enjoyed all the tracks especially ""Silent Lucidity"" by Queensryche! Regardless of the nitpicking about the album title (which is just a matter of perception after all) I would not hesitate to reccommend this CD to anyone!"
1,The Urban Neighborhood: A sociological Perspective,The order of this book was billed in my credit card about three weeks but yours are not send the book yet.Please take note of this situation.Federico Del Monte
5,Perfect for summer,These hats are amazing for kids. My kids love them and wear them all summer long. The sun protection is fantastic and the hat seems comfortable and easy to use.
3,Really cute- just too big,"I bought this for my son who is 6 months old. Really, very cute hat and seems like it's quality. However, the hat fits me (I bought the 0-12 month size). It's HUGE. Needless to say, I had to return it."
3,Sizing is way off,"This hat is way too big for my 8-month-old baby (who is 99th percentile in length and 95th percentile in weight, with a proportionately large head). It is impossible to keep on his head (even when he is not trying to take it off). The hat appears to be good quality and might work well for him a few months from now, but it is much larger than you would expect for a ""6 - 12 months"" size hat."
4,Great Beach Hat for baby,This is a great beach hat that will certainly protect your little one from the sun. I bought this for a recent vacation to the beach. I was nervous about our little one getting sunburn. This hat certainly helped out in that department.
1,Sizes: Baby and BABY,Why in the world are the 2 available size choices Baby and BABY? I am sick and tired of people posting product listings on Amazon without proof-reading them first. And where is Amazon with catching this? I am a working mom and don't have time to wait on an explanation via email. I need to order a sunhat now while I have 2 minutes to myself.
3,Too big!,"This hat was too big for my 4-mo. old son. Had to go to Target to find one that fit him (he does have a small head for his age). But it is a nice hat, and I intend to use it this summer after he grows into it."
2,Goofy style and color; too big for 10 month old,"The pros are that it looked like a good quality hat that would definitely keep the sun out of my baby's face. Lightweight, fabric that dries easily. And the cord is a good attempt at keeping it on her head. The cons were that it was totally goofy looking, the color (pink) was pretty different than the picture (I was hoping for rose), and it was huge on my 10 month old. The sizing said something like ""Fits 0-18 months."" I should have stopped right there. That's like saying your 1 year old's Pampers will fit you when you're old enough to need them again yourself. Needless to say I returned it. I guess hats are one of those (many) products that it's better to buy in person."
2,color is not the same,"My friend had a similar one, but hers is for 2 year+ use and it is adjustable. I got a 18 months one, it is not adjustable and the color isn't the same as picture shown."
3,Love this hat for my 3.5 yr old but bad sizing for our baby,"I bought this purely for the sun protection for my 3 year old. It looks great, keeps the son off his face and neck, and he wears it! I went back and ordered a smaller one for my 11 month old daughter and an adult version for myself.Update:I just received the hat I ordered for my daughter. Not quite the same hat. I loved the adjuster strap on the back of my son's and used it to fit the hat to his head. For my daughter's ""6-18 months"" hat, no adjuster strap and the hat is far too big. I'll have to stitch in something to make it tighter on her head (which is going to look really strange) but as it is, it won't fit her anytime this year. Hopefully it will last until next year and fit her then. The hat does have the chin strap at least. Really disappointed about the fit though. Should have ordered something else."
3,"fits well, color off, pricey!","We got Size - Youth (5+), Color - Cream.It arrived on time.It fits really well, and it's light, seems having good coverage.But the color we got is cream, it looks more like sand or tan.By the way, the price on Amazon or the seller on Amazon ""the Portable Baby"" is not competitive at all. I checked the manufacturer website after I received the order from Amazon, it is $19.95 on SundayAfternoons website Vs. $24-$30 sold from Amazon."
3,Sunday afternoons a must!,Great hat! Bought one for my son in San Diego and wanted the same for my daughter! Great little HAT!
5,Great hat,"This is my son's second of these- he outgrew the first one. We love it. It provides great coverage and it's the only hat that we can keep on his head, thanks to the strap design."
3,Too big,"Nice hat; however, i was hoping my 2 month old daughter could wear it right away but it is way too big for now."
5,Excellent sun hat for kids,Bought this for my 24 month old - great hat. It has a strap to keep it on if you need that and it is a cool and light. Highly recommend. Great back/neck coverage and shades his face.
4,adorable hat,I purchased this hat for my 21 month old grandaughter-size child 2 yrs to 5 yrs. She has a lot of hair and this fits her now. I doubt if it would fit a 5 yr old unless they are on the small side.The pink is adorable with purple inside the long flap. The material is much thinner than I thought but I am still glad I bought it.
4,Perfect for small home theater system.,"My den is fairly small and so the DLP projector I use is only about 13' from the screen. (My screen pulls down to cover the fireplace.) With my Optoma EP721 DLP projector, I get about an 85"" diagonal image, which fits this screen perfectly. The screen comes packed in a triangular cross-section box and made the trip with absolutely no damage. The projection surface is a matte white, which doesn't reflect the light as well as some of the more exotic materials, but it IS cleanable with a soft cloth and some mild detergent. The only aspect of this screen that I do not care for is that it doesn't hang as straight and flat as heavier screens. The (very) slight bulges and waves in the screen are sometimes visible in scenes with straight lines. Other than this, the screen works perfectly, extending and retracting smoothly and stopping at the required positions without much effort."
5,Best text introducing Chemical Engineering Calculations,"This is the best text appearing in the past decade, and that is dedicated to introduing Chemical Engineering calculations in a simple and straight forward way. I found the book extremely useful for all Chemical Engineering students at Alexandria University. Most of the students -in spite of being non-English speakers - had no problems in following the book, solving its problems, and continuously using the book throughout their course of study at the ChE Dept of Alex. U. They all agree: it is an indispensable reference to a Chemical Engineer"
4,It was worth it....,"I needed the third edition for my class but when I saw the second edition for this cheap I decided to get it. The biggest difference is that the numbering of the second and third edition are different. I had to do problems 2.25 but the numbers were like 1, 2, 3, 4 (no decimals).Other than that, I would recommend getting this book."
4,Great little book,I borrowed this book from a friend of mine a couple years ago and still have it! I find that it's a very portable accurate transcription of the tunes that are included.
3,Thin sound,"Better than volume I, but it could have had more fidelity. Chandos is known for its technical ability to make the music come alive. This is an old ADD recording as is volume I. The positive side is that both volumes contain over 40 tracks."
5,great book,Good service & good book. The book came in the specified time . Great read in Winter to prepare for planting weather .
4,This is a great kit,"When my 9 year old granddaughter opened this and put on the hat and had such a huge smile, I could only think,""thank you to Amazon for these reviews"". I think this is a great set, the table, and the tricks. My granddaughter was able to figure out some of the tricks on her own without the dvd. I was very glad for the review that recommended buying the scarf. That is a real plus."
4,Great but didn't get all the pieces,My kids really enjoy this but we were missing some of the pieces. So unfortunately we are unable to do all the tricks!
4,Nice,"Nice packaging, giving it as a Christmas gift! I am sure Grandchild will enjoy it. Did not have a chance to see content yet."
3,not great,"The grand kids, seven and nine, had some difficulty and lost interest rather quickly. Would say the children should be a little older than mine to really appreciate it"
4,Fun Magic For My 5 yr Old,"I ordered this magic set for my 5 year old. Most of the tricks are too hard for him to learn at this time (such as the card tricks), but he can do a lot of the tricks and loves showing us how he is ""magic"". I think that it is age appropriate and as his eye hand coordination improves he will be able to do all the tricks (practice- practice- practice). Overall the durability of the product is good but the box that it comes with is cardboard and is flimsy. The handle that you carry the box with pulled through the cardboard after two days and I feel with normal use the box will not last long.IN short I would recommend this product but wish the box could be made of better material. I feel that most of the tricks are age appropriate but know that your young child will not be able to perform all the tricks right off."
3,"""A"" for effort, ""D"" for quality","I purchased this magic kit for my 6 year old son who loves simple tricks. For the most part, a lot of the items and tricks are easy enough for him, however, the quality of the product concerns me. For instance, the magic collapsing hat has a huge spring inside to allow it to spring open but the fabric ties, I assume that is what they used, must have never been attached on ours. The moment it was pulled from the box, the spring nearly projected itself from the lining of the hat, luckily, the ends were protected with tape so no sharp edges."
4,"Bought it for my 8 year old, and it was an instant hit!",Bought this for my 8 year old and he loved it. Immediately popped in the DVD and started performing tricks for us that night. Definitely worth the money.
4,Hours of fun! A must have! :),"This magic trick set is absolutely amazing! You should have seen the look on the girl's face when she opened the package. There was this new sparkle in her eye and I could just tell I was going to be entertained for hours. She opened up the box and peeked inside. Her first words were ""Wow! This is the best magic trick set ever! Prepare to be amazed!"" If you have a child who just loves magic tricks, or wants to try something new, this is the gift for them! It's fun and comes with tons of magic tricks. There are some easy tricks for the beginning, and as you progress, so does the difficulty of the tricks. She has been showing me these tricks for a long time and there are some that even I can't figure out!!!!!! There is simply nothing to complain about. If I were to pick something, I have to say it would be that the cardboard storage box is not completely durable, but don't let that stop you and your child from having the time of your magical lives!"
4,9 year old loves it,"We got this for our 9 year old daughter because she loves to do magic tricks. The instruction book is easy for her to follow and she loved that it came with a ""table"". The table is a little flimsy but it works. Some of the pieces seem a little cheap but overall this is a great buy. My daughter sees no flaws with it and uses it all the time."
5,"Good quality, lots of tricks","I bought this for my eight year old and the tricks are age appropriate--some are simple enough to master quickly, while others are providing a challenge. The box is cardboard, so I'm sure it won't last forever, but the pieces inside are of good quality. There are a LOT of tricks in this set, which includes a booklet and dvd. Another plus is that unlike many magic trick sets that I looked at, this one includes the magician's hat and wand."
4,Purchased for 13 yr old grand daughter,"Purchased for 13 year old grand daughter, she really wanted magic show stuff. Will have to wait to see how she likes it, after spending time, learning to do tricks and etc."
5,unique and creative,"This was a Christmas gift for our seven year old son. It's been a fun toy - it's somewhat unique and has allowed him to read directions, practice a skill, demonstrate a skill in front of others, etc. I've had fun doing a few tricks and ""amazing"" the kids with an illusion. Some of the skills seem well beyond him (and me, for that matter). It's a toy that needs to be carefully stowed away - there are lots of pieces that need to be kept as part of the set. I'm glad we purchased this."
2,Overpriced for what you get,"I paid about $40 for this magic set for my daughter for Christmas. This is the one she wanted, so she was excited to open the box and try it out. I have to say that I have not yet tried watching the DVD, but the instructions are very small, hard to read, and also very hard to understand. My daughter is seven, and there is no way she can understand the instructions as they are written. Consequently, she quickly tired of this and moved on to other things. Also, when I pulled out all of the contents, it looks like a lot of cheap and flimsy junk, not worth the $40.00 I paid for it. The box (which doubles as the ""performance table"") is 10X larger than it needs to be to contain the few small pieces which are inside. I will edit this review later once I have tried to watch the video."
5,Has Lasted Years,"I bought this set for my daughter several years ago when she was about 6 years old, admittedly for the hat and wand. It has been one of those toys that she has used regularly over the years. She's older now and can do many of the tricks that were much too complicated for her back then. There are a handful of very simple tricks that young children can easily do, like a box that ""disappears"" any small item by simply pushing a drawer in. There are lots of more complicated tricks as well that are challenging even for adults. It's an impressive gift - the size of it plus the amount of stuff inside gives it a definite ""wow"" factor. Black cardboard suitcase-style box is used for storage and has held up well."
4,Great price,"I bought this for the for my seven year old daughter. The price I think is very good for what you get, but there are some missing components, but again for the price and what you get I think it will be worth the money and fun you and yur child will have."
5,Very fun and a great confidence booster for children!,"This is a great price for all the magic tricks you get with this set! I've been to magic shops were the simplest of tricks cost five dollars, so getting all these props and tricks is a a bargain. My 8 year old loves these and it helps build self confidence and it is good practice to learn to speak in front of an audience. One of the best thing is the instructional dvd that takes you step by step on how to perform each trick, the instruction manual is hard to follow, so I highly suggest watch the dvd with your child."
2,Not the best gift for a 7 yr old.,"The instructions are wordy for the magic tricks, maybe for a child 10+ it wouldn't be so hard for them to understand."
3,for Grandson,He is 10 years old and says he likes it. I can only say that. I also got him a separate hat and bunny to go with it. I think the bunny in this one is sponge or paper.. Same for the hat. But it has some magic tricks that my grandson enjoys. A good started kit.
5,Magic show,My boys received this for Christmas. They really have fun with it. It comes with a lot of tricks and a DVD to teach them how to use it.
3,Cool Tricks for Kids,"My [...] daughter loves this. She watched the dvd on her own and performed for us. I was disappointed that the ""rabbit"" to pull out of the hat & for use on other tricks is a small yellow rabbit shaped sponge. Of course to adults some of the tricks are cheesy, but my daughter loves them! I have never seen any other to compare it to."
5,Very happy!,"We bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas and he loves it! There were plenty of tricks that he could do and his 13 yr. old brother loved it just as much. Quality is good - i'm sure not the best, but still very good since he's just using it as a toy. The case is just cardboard but if you're gentle with it should last a good while. He loves the hat and wand that came with it!"
2,"Okay, but...","My kids loved it initially, but got bored fairly quickly. Also the cardboard box that is supposed to be the ""performance table"" ripped on day 1."
5,son loves it,we bought this kit for my son for his 9th birthday and he loves it. Even though the box is pretty easily broken everything else is working out great he's having a great time with it. Definitely a good set to buy the budding magician.
4,Magic Set,The hat made the whole thing! A 9 year old was the recipient and had a wonderful time trying all the different tricks. Certainly kept her occupied for some time. Great!
5,A Complete Value,"I bought this for my son's birthday and not only did the other kids look at it in awe, but my husband and I sat and watched the DVD with our son and kept doing the tricks ourselves. The only caveat being that our son was somewhat disappointed to find out that magic is a ""trick"". So, if they are still in the ""believe in Santa"" phase, I would hold off on this one another year. Otherwise, love it."
2,Poof--your money disappeared!,"My daughter really wanted this for Christmas. It was high priced for cheap props, she lost interest after five minutes."
2,Lost intrest,"My daughter really wanted this for christmas thinking it would be so cool and wanted to preform magic. But the performance table is pretty lousy and the props there arevcheap and flimsy. My daughter lies that wand and hat but when she cleaned her room, i found out that he put away her kitunderneath her bed and hs never played with it since..... Waste of money."
4,new gender information,"the most fascinating thing in this book is the information about the original gender partnering. Men could have one mate. Women were allowed to be married to one man and have another male friend on the side. Women also could have two husbands while men had only one spouse.This is very different from the sexism practiced in Lakota circles today where the woman is still considered ""less than"" and put in a servitude position."
4,TOYOTA OWNERS MANUAL,I BOUGHT A USED CAR AND NEEDED THIS MANUAL TO FIGURE OUT LITTLE THINGS ABOUT MY CAR. WAS HELPFUL JUST LIKE AN OWNERS MANUAL SHOULD BE.
1,Did not even work.,"Received this product in new packaging, but joypad didn't even work. Wanted to send it back, but would have cost me six bucks to send back a seven dollar joypad. NOT HAPPY."
3,Not bad but not the best..,"I had 2 original controllers for my super nintendo but one of the broke :(, so I had to get a new one. I knew it would'nt be the same, but the price was excellent and it arrived packaged nicely and quickly. The controller works, but I don't think it's as fast as the real one. Sometimes I have trouble jumping or running fast, but it works and is better than having nothing!"
3,SNES controller,The controller does not work with the USB adapter but it does work directly with the SNES. The buttons work well but the directional pad is a bit stiff.
2,Not as good as the original controller.,It functions. The D-pad and buttons are not nearly as sensitive as an original Snes controller which makes playing certain games pretty difficult. I'd much rather pay more for a better controller than this. It feels pretty cheaply made as well but I guess that's what I get for only paying $5 for a controller.
5,Super Nintendo Controller,"The classic controller that can be used with an Super NES. Also it is a lot easier to use then the ""Special"" controller that is bigger than your face."
5,Excellent replacements,"Not as great built or smooth feel as my stock SNES controllers but these are GREAT replacements for the price. The real nintendo ones are a bit smoother, but these will get there in time xD. The buttons are great and responsive just like my real ones. My only issue is that it is much shorter than the originals which made some of my family sit up close to the tv to play. But overall GREAT product and came extremely quick."
1,"CHEAP; Not inexpensive mind you, cheap.","This controller, or actually a pair of them were purchased to replace the original SNES game pads which I had for nearly twenty years (and they did not malfunction, they simply vanished). the first one I plugged in did not last 20 days. The second one has been in operation for about two months now, played only occasionally, and is already starting to have performance issues. Looking for replacement controllers for your SNES console? Do yourself a favor. Don't buy these. Pry your wallet open and spring for genuine Nintendo game pads. If ya can't find them even used, at least find a better product than this POS. EPIC FAIL!"
1,didn't last long cheap,Worked for a day and stopped working best advice buy the old school snes controllers will never buy from this company again u get what u pay for and not even that
1,Deceiving picture,The picture for this item was incredibly deceiving. It indicates a genuine super nintendo controller. Complete with purple buttons and such. The item I received was a knock off brand with green red and yellow buttons. The directional pad is not responsive at all. I plug it into my console and using the directional pad sometimes doesn't work or takes 2 seconds for the button's press to register in all the games I own.
3,ok replacement,I got this when I got my retron3 ( I think the best clone system) because I could not find a real controller. I had no problems yet and have had it for about 4 months. The only problem I can see is the d pad. It makes a squeek if you try to make many movements quickly. It seems reponcive and is dirt cheap. I cant complain. If you have the option and the price is only off by a few (3-5) dollors between this and a real sneer controller then go with the original.
2,You're getting your money's worth,"I believe I paid ten dollars for this controller so I could use it on my emulator. The thing is terrible. The D-Pad is clunky, and impossible to move diagonally on. The four buttons aren't any better either. Honestly, the only thing they didn't screw up is the start and select buttons. This is a horrible purchase. You'd be better off just going to a Game-X-Change and finding an old, real controller. I paid half of what I paid for this, and it's twice as good."
1,Not worth s***,"Bought two and the directional pad doesnt work properly on either one if them, cause me to lose several tecmo game because Im trying to move my player to the right and it goes backward, very fustrating, I took them out in my drive way and crushed them with a sledgehammer, SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET THE SNES BRAND CONTROLLERS,......"
3,Cheap,"Stupid cheap and STUPID CHEAP! The buttons were colored (okay, i like that better). but they feel really squishy. the whole thing is shoddy too. I got it for a mod, so I'm fine, but I wouldn't;t want to play with this. your finger would get tired pretty quick i bet.the button labels were like a sticker that somebody printed in their garage and threw on the controller. anyway, if you want a really chintzy controller, this is it. It's only $5."
3,SNES Controllers,"These controllers work just ""okay"". My boys complain that sometimes their character on the game will go the opposite direction that they want them to go. A little stiff, but for the price, I guess they were alright."
4,Good but couple drawbacks,"Controller works great. Only think is the label that labels X Y A B falls off right away. Also the cord length is shorter than normal controller, its only about 3 feet."
3,At least it works,"First of all, you will not get what you see in the picture. The controller is very light and the buttons are stiff and stick way out. The buttons on the front also feel loose. Also, the cord is very short. It is maybe 4 feet long. So I have to pull out my console to use this controller in my recliner. I bought this controller to use with my Retron 3 and it works. Bottom line, if you are picky about your game controllers then I would suggest that you get an official Nintendo licensed controller. If you're not picky, this controller will work for you."
3,Snes controller,"A decent controller for a retro console. I was sort of expecting an official SNES controller rather than some sort of homemade brand, but this is okay too. Came in the box mint condition, has no labels on front or back. Buttons seem to be okay, D-pad is a bit stiff though."
1,Terrible.,"Received a controller which was not what was originally pictured (picture was colored button superpad). This is a cheap knockoff of the original, which I received completely DAMAGED. Will never order from this company again. Waste of my money and wasn't worth spending the money to ship it back."
5,very happy,My son has a SNES system but the controllers didn't workthe best. We have been looking everywhere for them. I got them for our son for a Christmas gift and he was so excited to have controllers that work. I was very pleased we got them when they told us we would. Excelent serice will use them again. Also the cords are longer making it easier to play.
4,Works well!,"Item arrived faster than an item I purchase at the same time time even though the delivery date for this one was supposed to be a day later at least haha. This would be 5 stars if it didn't look poorly made. Small chunk missing in lower right part of the 4 button set up and the R button can be tricky, you just have to know where to push it to get it to work right =P works perfect with my computer! Haven't tested it with an actual SNES system but if it works for my computer I see no reason to doubt its performance on the SNES. Cord is definitely longer than most the controllers I've seen on Amazon. I'd say almost 6 feet. I'm 5'9"" last I checked a few years ago and it reaches a little above me from the ground.I'd definitely recommend this over the other controllers that are on Amazon if you're not looking for an original SNES controller, which I'll say, are TERRIBLY DIFFICULT to find."
4,Nice,"The earrings were very nice, just as the picture and prodcut details stated. The shipping was very fast, the packing was good. They even put a small jewelry bag for this pair of earrings. It was well worth the price."
3,Acting great...movie not.,"The actors in this movie did a great job, but the story, the script, the sound were all just blah. The story made no sense and the conclusion made no sense. The only plus in this movie was the actors."
4,As Fun As The Original,"This edition of Clue contains great grapics, cool jazz music (which they should have on while you play the game as well). The animation flows without any bugs and you can play different levels like easy, medium, hard. Not the best game available so wait until this one is on sale."
3,Clue PC game,"This game is good, but it wasn't as interactive as I'd hoped. It felt like an old Mac game adapted for the PC. It's still entertaining, but not one that would keep me coming back often.One major gripe: It doesn't run on Windows XP and I couldn't find anything saying that it wasn't compatible! (It works fine on Win98)"
3,Clue is 3D!!,"This clue game is fun but they could have done a better job. It is hard to move. I always get stuck on the corners. But there are some good things. It follows the game clue very well. The graffics are also great. At the sound of the game you would think you see someone murdering someone. This is not true. All you see is a person, holding [something]. Then you hear a scream. That's all."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,"The blue fibers from the head accumulated on my dash more than dust. The twisted metal wire is exposed on the end and scratched my LCD screen. I am calling the manufacturer, this should be taken off the shelves."
4,"Just like the original, but still fun","Frogger has the exact same gameplay as the original. The only thing different about it is the graphics, the sound, and it has more levels. It is basically an updated version of the original. The graphics are pretty good. Everything in the game is colorful. The only thing that looks weird is when you look at the front of Frogger's face. It looks kind of messed up because he is made of polygons. The sound is pretty good as well. Except the buzzing of the flies that frogger can eat. That is a little bit annoying. That is why you want to eat them as fast as you can. The controls of the game are pretty simple and easy to handle. Its all on the arrow keys. Overall I think this game is a classic, and is fun to play. I recommend it."
2,"You play this on modern machines, you will regret it!","If you are going to buy this game and you have a new machine, don't! I tried this game on my newest machine, and the graphics look very bad on a modern 3D graphics card, because, the card is not compatible with the game. If you want this game so bad, look all over your house for a Pentium 2 machine with an outdated 3D graphics card, or buy an old machine that comes with the 3D graphics card."
2,Frogger,"In the arcade game, you cross the street to get home. In this new version, you collect baby frogs to save the population. There are many new obstacles, and some fun parts here and there, but getting all of the baby frogs at once I think is too much to ask. For one thing, you're timed. That makes it nearly impossible to do anything but the quickest way. The music is okay, but the gameplay is choppy, the graphics are like enlarged pixels, and you have to play the levels over and over to know what to do. In short, it's a waste of time that can get way too addicting, even with the quality. I don't see why you need to save the population 225 baby frogs left, and there are many farfetched ideas of bad guys. It also crashes my system, and my friends', too. I'm glad this game isn't mine."
4,Meghan,"Frogger is a neat game with dozens of challenging levels, nine unique worlds, cool music, and 3-D graphics. Frogger is an excellent game for people who have skill and like to fun. People of all ages will love Frogger. GET THE GAME FROGGER!"
1,An utter disappointment,"Take it from one of the original frogger fanatics -- the retro level is not even close. They tried adding more detailed graphics, and ended up completely slowing down and destroying the game. You're not even allowed to see the entire playing field, only the next few jumps. All this for more detailed bumps on logs. Ridiculous. It's also hard for me to understand how the play can be so disastrously jerky when computers must be at least what? 1000 times faster than 20 years ago? Even the typeface is completely unreadable. What a shame.(To top it all off, the highly paid professionals that just plain ruined this game seem to have spent most of their development time on frog fornication graphics. Embarassing and juvenile, but not particularly appropriate for an 8 year old.)"

1,Don't Jump for Frogger,"I was really looking forward to this game. However, I was disappointed once I started playing it. The graphics are terrible. The game is very slow. Controlling the frog is awkward. I'm really sorry I wasted my money on this one."
5,Great text for weight loss and health!,"I received this book as part of a PR packet in my office and when the author called to see if I had received it I took a deeper look. I have just ordered three more copies so that a number of us in the office can do the program together. I have history of CVD, Diabetes and Cancer on both sides of my family and feel that this healthful, well-rounded program will help me change the message my cells are getting from the food I eat. I will be giving this book as a gift as well as following the plan for the rest of my life.Thank you, Jennifer!Darren"
5,thesis,this book is the basic concept for mixed effect model which is really helpful for the first time learning how to use R for LME model.
2,Good in some ways but,It is difficult to understand who this book is written for. The authors are clearly clever guys but strangely the book does little to explain the command structure for modelling in the authors' own package! It would be useful to explain the models in the context of random effects/nested modelling in conventional ANOVA for newbies. Please authors if you do a second edition show how really simple models are programmed.A good example of its beginner unfriendliness is the first example(!) to have a vector within a dataframe of exactly the same name. Not a good idea in a text book. You would have thought the editor would have had something to say about that.
5,"R and S, The best in statistical analysis","The book has excelent presentation (theory and practical), overall a lot applications with R (my favorite)...If you want to be update in applied statistics, in my opinion, you should have it..."
3,Probably 2 and 1/2 stars.,If you can hang in there and watch it till the end....the ending is worth it and makes sense of it all. A small thumbs up.
2,Sleep Inducing,Caught again with a poor pcture poorly packaged and presented. Boring and almost as tired as I felt watching it. Dvd given to a charity shop.
2,The results are not clear.,"I have bought this product about a month ago and using it daily, but I don not see any results so far."
5,Christ in the Carols,"This little book is everything I'd hoped for...and more. Beautiful...hard back...and the price was amazing. We'll be using this special book during the month of December, keeping Christ in our Christmas."
