3,Obviously earlier writing...,"This is obviously a book that was written 10 years ago and published recently. The characters and plot were apropos of an early 90s book. I didn't connect with the hero or heroine, and thought that their reactions (especially the heroine's) were unrealistic. Stick with her TDD series, folks."
3,How could she?,"OK, every one of us need the money, but this book is not more (somethimes less) then any of other thousends of other writers, and we all know, she can do better - a lot better. I did regret having bought it, because of her name.Could she not publish under other name this kind of books?"
2,"Unfortunately, Not her best","I have waited with anticipation for SB's re-released books. Letters to Kelly, Forever Blue, Prince Joe (to name a few) are wonderful. So I eagerly purchased Scenes of Passion and was .... sadly disappointed.It's an average read, not a great one."
4,A nice comfortable read,I enjoyed it. The story was just emotional enough without going overboard. The conflict was honest enough to not feel forced. The friends-to-lovers theme worked well in this story. The only thing I wished was that it had been a longer book. The characters cried out for deeper fleshing out.
5,plow markers.,they are standard plow markers. look nice. just got this year not sure how well they hold up. looks like they will be fine.
5,"Sequels, Sequels!",I have just finished reading My Guardian Angels: Jack & Fred. It is a very well-written wonderful story. The author makes you feel like you are in the middle of all the action. I was disappointed when the story ended cause I wanted to read more. Hopefully there will be a sequel soon. This book is different from any I've ever read and a real treasure. Keep up the good work Joseph St. Angelo.
2,Angels with a New York Attitude,I found the characters annoying and mean...and they are supposed to be guardian angels?
1,Take a pass!,"This book is poorly written, with horribly long explanations of action. I found the characters to be shallow and kind of stupid. I'm annoyed I spent so much money on it!"
1,should have a better choice,"Poor choice and quality of photos (news photos taken from appearance in functions), disappointing for fans. Wish Amazon(US)had a better choice on offer."
5,Great,"This is a great compilation that really does span ""Through The Years"". This makes it excellent for the person who does not know exactly what Tull is all about, or who only owns a few cd's. As far as tracks go, this release is identical to the import ""Collection"", the tracks are just in a diffrent order. And since prices change, just remember to get whichever one is cheapest, or available the soonest!"
3,Dated,"I purchased this video assuming I could use it with educators. To me, however, it apears dated and too over the top with its message. While it was great to see JIMMY CAGNEY in a new role, overall it was disappointing."
1,Misleading mAh,"Batteries are not only rated for the product they are compatible with but also their capacity. Some vendors do not list mAh (mili-Amp Hours) of capacity of the battery they are selling. High capacity batteries are more expensive but if this is not advertized, you can't tell and you can't compare.EA"
2,OK Overall with some issues,"I purchased the DynaDock (DVI version) about a month ago. I use it with two fairly new (10 month old and 5 month old) Toshiba laptops. I followed the install procedures and got the dock ""working"" with both PCs. Things to be aware of include: 1. With a 22"" monitor (1600X1050 resolution) leaving the video color setup at 32 bit causes the windows to open and close very slow and choppy (setting it at 16 bit eliminated this problem) 2. Once you install the dynadock software onto a laptop - every time you boot up that laptop (including awaking from sleep) the screen will flicker for about 5 seconds at bootup (annoying) 3. The process of ""ejecting the dock"" never seems to work 100% 4. Entering/awaking Vista sleep is not 100% reliableOverall - the dynadock is OK - but it needs some more work before its ready for the mainstream computer user. Its still too finicky with its current software/hardware version."
2,Display problems,"The ""high performance video"" in this product is made by DisplayLink, I believe it is one of their USB video adapters built into the DynaDock.I use it with a 19"" Philips 109P40 VGA CRT. In 1280x1024, it will only do 60 Hz refresh rate.The same monitor will do 85 Hz refresh rate at that resolution when connected directly to the laptop.I contacted DisplayLink tech support to ask them if this is expected or if it should do better. They said it should do better, and after going back and forth answering some of their questions they advised me to get a new monitor."
2,"Great for video, bad for keyboard/mouse","Got this to replace the mfr-specific docks that go with laptops. The video works well enough, as others have indicated. Plug in a keyboard and mouse, and the fun begins.The dock comes with its own software, which it is recommended to use to Eject. So, if you have a keyboard or mouse plugged in, the Eject is refused because it would disconnect a Human Interface Device. What a concept! Give me a dock for my HIDs, then refuse to work as designed because I have plugged in HIDs.Hardware: 5 stars, does everything it should.Software: 1 star, functional but has serious flaws."
1,Dynasht,"How does a company release a Toshiba docking station into the market that doesn't work with a Toshiba laptop? This piece of sht takes forever to install and in the end, doesn't even work with a popular Toshiba line - Satellite M30x. Of course if I plug in the VGA cable directly into my laptop, the monitor works fine. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT get this piece of sht product.TOSHIBA - PULL THIS PIECE OF SHT LINE FROM YOUR CATALOG AND WEBSITE PLEASE!"
3,DVD no more,"I just got my copy from Amazon.com after having it in my wishlist for the longest while. Guess I should have checked more carefully because between the time I added the New Order: International CD to the wishlist vs when I ordered it, they no longer include the DVD - just the CD. And the DVD was the main reason I wanted this. So I'm feeling ripped off especailly when most of the comments on why people bought this was for the bonus DVD."
5,A great compilation,"I have been a fan for a very long time and I own ALMOST every album New Order has released. This was an excelent compilation and while I agree with many of the other reviews as far as the pros and cons(especialy about The Perfect Kiss) I should explain to everyone THE REASON the shorter Low-Life version of Perfect Kiss was used. CDs have a maximum time limit of 1:20:00. A track list using the Full Length version of Perfect Kiss sets the total time to roughly 1:20:48. It is impossible to fit this list onto CD so they instead used the Low-Life version which set the total time to roughly 1:17:35. Now that that is cleared up, I DEFINATELY recomend this album to fans and newcomers alike. I also recomend that you buy all of thier albums so you can get the full experience because this compilation while very good, just doesnt cover enough of New Order's great work."
2,"Thought it was good at first, but not anymore.","I purchased this stand along with a Tweezerman badger brush. The brush fits on the stand perfectly. I thought the stand looked a little silly in the picture, but it looks much nicer in person. Especially when the brush is in it. This stand appears to be well constructed and is perfect for its intended use.*** Update on 2/26/12 ***I loved this stand at first, as you can see by my initial review above. At that point I gave it 5 stars. But today I took 3 stars away. After only 3 months, the bottom has begun to rust. For some stupid reason, I assumed that this stand was stainless steel. I know that it says ""chrome"" on the description, but I was not paying close attention when I ordered. This is designed to hold a wet dripping object. How is it not made of a metal that resists rust?I didn't totally kill it because I was able to scrape the rust off with a flat head screw driver. Let's see how well this works out from here on out."
1,Omega shaving brush stand,"Nice quality stand, though a little different than the item number depicted (as I shopped Omega first to determine what model I wanted). I only gave this purchase one star because it took FGP SEVEN days before they even mailed it ... then another week for me to get it USPS slow mail."
2,They send me a used product instead of NEW,"Both disks of the futurama season were greatly scratched, resulting in lagging when loading each episode for disk one, and more obvious lagging and a single skipping spot in disk two. Even though it said that it was new, the package was not sealed properly, which led me to believe that I was given a used copy. I want the item exchanged, however due to amazon rules, I can not since I had to open the DVD in order to notice the disks were damaged to begin with.I chose a two star rating, because even though there are several spots that are lagged and a single skip spot, it is a great season of futurama."
1,INCORRECT TITLING!,"I own seasons 1-5 of Futurama on DVD and this collection of episodes (or at least the titles listed) are NOT season 7. This is Season 5. PLEASE NOTE: My harsh rating has nothing to do with the QUALITY of this series. Futurama is witty without delving too far into the realms of idiocy (such as American Dad, South Park, Family Guy, etc.) and I am a HUGE fan. The rating is intended to hopefully convince either Amazon or the seller to post things CORRECTLY."
1,How far left can you get,"I used to enjoy Futurama, but not anymore. It is almost like Matt Groening is saying how far left can we go. It is amazing to me how anti-christian this show has gone. This eposide is just anothe rexample. I still watch the show sometimes, but only on TV. I will not pay for this show and I turn the channel when it starts to get to be to much.Sad to see Futurama destroyed like this."
5,One of the best written so far,"This is a very well written episode. It is up there with the episode about Fry's fossilized dog. It is also extra heavy on the science humor, in fact this episode even led to a new math theorem proven by one of the writers. I highly recommend it."
4,Good Episode,"This is either the 2nd episode, or 2nd half of the 1st episode of season 7 depending on who you talk to. Amazon currently sells this separate from ""Rebirth"" in standard definition but sells it as a part of ""Rebirth"" in HD. (If you plan to buy, buy it in HD as it will save you money, for this episode at least as you will get both episodes for $2.99 in HD but will pay $1.99 per episode in SD, however, double check this upon purchase as they may correct this issue after my posting).The episode itself is back to the ever enjoyable back and forth between Lela and Zapp Brannigan. Lela and Zapp become ""Adam and Eve"" when a satellite (half v-chip, half military) begins destroying worlds by censorship. Hilarity ensues."
5,Volume 7 is Great,"I thought that Futurama really stepped up its game for the newest season. Volume 7 is funnier and has much better story lines than Volume 6, which I thought was average at best."
1,What happened??,"This show has been one of my favorites for years. It's funny, clever, & entertaining as can be. This season was a HUGE disappointment. The shows had nothing to do with the others. They didn't deliver anything, there were no invasions by aliens, and they were boring. I didn't laugh even once during the entire season. They must have brought in new writers because this season was just so different. Bring back the original writers for smurfs sake because season 7 blew."
5,I love it! These guys are funny!,"This brings my collection of Futurama up to date with last season.I love this series, and hope they never stop putting out new episodes, and the series runs for many seasons."
4,People need to read . ..,"This season's episodes were far better than S6-A. There are more memorable lines and more memorable stories. I just hope that Fox doesn't do the cheap ass packaging again like the last 2 volumes.P.S.: It read Volume 7, not season 7. Learn to read people."
3,Solid Return for Futurama,"I am a big Futurama fan an the return of the show has been much anticipated for myself. I think shows returning to air is always slightly awkward for a few episodes. So while this isn't the best Futurama episode in the world, it still good fun. The confusion for me is that according to Comedy Central, there has only been one episode (the HD versions of this seems to agree with that). However, I had to purchase both 'Rebirth' AND 'In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela' as separate episodes where I believe the HD version is actually both episodes combined. My only complaint about this is each of the Standard Definition episodes cost me $1.99 and the HD version containing both cost $2.99. So in the end I paid more for SD.Bottom Line:If you are a Futurama fan, worth the purchase, however, buy episode 1 in HD to save yourself money."
2,Buy a different christmas special,"Of the 3 different holiday stories, only the second one has the intelligent humor expected of futurama. If it weren't for Al Gore im not sure that it would have been funny. This episode continues to follow the downward spiral from what we knew of futurama. buy season 2 episode 4 a Xmas Story if your looking for a holiday themed futurama."
1,Isn't Worth It,"This clothing storage closet its not worth. After one week it broke. This thing is like a toy if you hang two wool coat in it its going to break if you hang more than 12 shirts in it, its going to break. Like i said its a toy you have to use gently and use it for light clothes only!!"
1,Kathleen A.,The worst product I have ever purchased. It fell apart within the first month. Don't waste your money!
1,Do Not Buy!!!,These boots fell apart within one month of purchasing them!! Do not purchase these boots!!
2,Not so flattering boot,after wearing these for 2 hours the seam in the front of the boot is starting to rip. I'm hoping to return these and I am very disappointed that Charles would put his name on these cheaply made boots
2,Buyer Beware - Not typical C.D. quality!,Not the quality I imagined at all of Charles David. I wish some of the newer reviews that are up now were up when I bought these boots. I actually purchased one in each color and am returning them both sadly : <I definitely believe that after wearing them after a short time that they could fall apart.
1,Disappointed in quality,I am usually very happy with Charles David shoes. This shoe was apparently made wrong because it was so uncomfortable. I gave it away to a friend.
4,Nice Boot for the Money,"I don't usually wear this high of a heel, but this is a pretty comfortable boot. I wouldn't wear it for walking. And the bottom is very slick. But that is because it is a nice, well made, real leather sole. The square toe has plently of room also."
1,Awaiting returned item confirmation??,"I've bought the boots, it's nice, however, it didn't fit as i expected, so I've returned it on Dec 26, 2006 after X-mas, and followed returned policies/precedures and afixed returned-label on the original box. Yet, I have not received my status or the refund amount?? Please check status of this return for refund. Thanks for your help...if possible?...your ever-shopping customer, Wing."
2,Not god enough,"Eddie is a terrific comedian on his day. I don't know why he brought out this drivel (by his standards). Some might enjoy it and I can see how they might. For me however, he did too many weak jokes that I have heard before ad nauseum. He cusses way too much and for no reason at all. Don't get me wrong, I am no prude, and yes, I do enjoy cussing, but I like it to be done in context. Eddie cusses for the sake of it, without being funny. I find it a tad disappointing because he truly is among the top 10 comedians working today.His other work is far superior to this."
5,hilarious,I'm going to have to disagree with the above review. He has a point but he's all mixed up. if you have seen dysfunctional family and all his other stand up then those will be boring because this was his first big special. I remember watching this is 1997 when it first came out and it is still to this day the performance that is still the funniest that i have ever seen.
2,Eddie why don't you make me laugh?,"This is the third DVD from Eddie, but it really sucks. Is wasn't funny only sometimes bits en pieces. I've never seen the end of this dvd because is was so boring.There are know new jokes, and all the general Eddie Griffin jokes. If you've seen I got the Hook up an Dysfuntional Family. Voodoo Child will be stupid to watch. Eddie can do much and much more, than this. Eddie make me laugh again......"
5,BEST BIRD BOOK FOR ME,THIS BOOK IS EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND. I KEEP IT BY ME WHEN I AM WATCHING THE BIRDS AT MY FEEDERS OR IN MY YARD. A VERY EXCELLENT BOOK.
3,not that great,"This gets really quite hot when you use it, its not that bright or really that awesome in general, I bought a strobe light to use instead of this and it was better. Maybe if this was more powerful and I didn't feel that it could ignite any fabric that got too close, I would actually use it more often. It is kinda a cool effect."
3,nice lights,these are really good party lights...for small parties..i think with some fog and strobe lights...we totally made it come to life.
2,Seemed boring and pointless to me,"Contains spoilers.This movie is very highly rated at imdb.com so the problem must be with me, but I thought this was a very boring movie. Starts off good and who doesn't like end of the world movies? But then... nothing. Ten days of sitting around engaging in inane dialogue. No suspense, no action, no nothing. But the power stays on the whole time through magic fairies or something.Then, suddenly, it all comes together and we find out what happened. Then what? More in-fighting and bickering. Then the raid led by -- who was that guy? Why is he so pissed off at everyone? No character development at all. And so this college kid leads a raid against people smart enough to outwit the FBI and steal a nuke, but he beats them all even though he has a handgun and they have automatic weapons. Okay. Could have at least made the kids ROTC and the Black Dawn incompetent somehow.Any zombie movie is better than this movie. At least something happens after the world ends."
1,don't buy this doll,"First there are 2 versions of this doll, one has software with all sorts of windows conflicts and you can't download ANY additional names to it. This doll made my computer freeze and other problems, I had to uninstall MS Groove (an Office product) to get it to work properly. It does NOT have dad, daddy, brother, sister, or many other names. I saw dad and daddy on the website so though those issues were resolved, but NO. And customer service won't help. It just isn't worth the money at all. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere."
3,Says my childs name WRONG!!,"Our daughter looved this Elmo doll and thought it was very cool. Yet when I went to program the Elmo, I found our daughter's name Giovanna. Pronounced exactly how it's spelled. Yet Elmo says it GO vanna. There is no way to change how Elmo says the name, so I'm very disappointed. The concept of the doll is to help the child learn their name and it doesn't work when Elmo says her name wrong!! We are returning this to the store."
5,What a fun toy!,"I just bought this toy for my son's birthday. I did not have any problems installing the program or downloading the information into Elmo. It really didn't take long at all and was actually fun to be able to pick what Elmo will say to my son. One feature that is really exciting is the Birthday Countdown feature. Elmo actually counts down the days until my son's birthday and then will sing him a special birthday song on his special day. I can't wait to give it to him at his party this weekend so he can hear the daily countdown. Also another neat feature is that you can change the songs, games, or stories that Elmo can play. This way he won't become boring over a short period of time."
3,ELMO download Failed workaround,"Basically it is a great toy with a MAJOR problem. The software will not download to ELMO. I tried everything from reinstalling a non-sp2 xp, win 2k, and both failed.I also tried setting my bios to USB 1.1 mode only and it also failed.Being a computer programmer I couldn't give up. Not on X-Mas eve and a toy I was counting on for my daughters special christmas. So one last attempt. This time on a laptop with XP SP2 but it had only a 1.1 USB (no 2.0 capability). It worked like a charm the first time and I am so happy I'll have this toy ready tomorrow morning.I then tried"
1,Piece of Junk,"My daughter recently turned 2 and we received 2 Elmo Knows your name dolls. The day of her birthday I spent over 2 hours trying to install the software and get the doll to work. Then I read all the negatives reviews and was dismayed. The first one would only say my daughters name and then there would be static. Now it does NOTHING AT ALL. Yes I replaced the batteries etc...The second one will download to about 97-98% and will only say my daughter's name and then static. Nothing more.I have both a Windows computer and a MAC (which I greatly prefer). The software, of course, isn't compatible with MAC.I, for one, won't buy any more ELMO or any other FisherPrice products (I have already sworn off Windows computers)."
3,Beware- Does Not work with a MAC,"I bought this toy for my daughter, and briefly read the directions in the store. I have a very new computer, so I didn't think it would be a problem to use the CD ROM. No where on the box does it state that it is not MAC compatible. When I called Fisher Price, I was told that it won't work with a MAC."
5,Really cute toy!!,"My daughter is only 1 year old, and she already loves the Sesame Street characters. This toy sounded like a perfect present for her. I was a little afraid to buy it because of all the bad reviews the toy was getting, but, I decided to take the chance anyway. If it helps who feels the same, it is not hard to program it at all, for me, it was actually very easy. The only thing I would like to be changed is the program itself, because I would like for him to say more names from her family. Overall, it is very cute, and she likes it so far. She is too little to understand the games (the toy is for 18 months), but you can put just songs and stories..."
1,I agree with most of you!,"I agree with most of you. I was so excited when I heard this Elmo was one of the ""hot Christmas items."" I quickly purchased one online to ensure I'd have one for my 23-month old by Christmas. When I tried to program it yesterday, I too got the ""Download Fail"" message so many times. Just when I thought all was lost, I pressed his hand and he started talking. Only he wasn't saying everything he was supposed to. I got half stories and songs, etc. Then in the middle of the night he'd talk and not be quiet!Finally tonight we took him back and exchanged him. This next doll was no better! I have a top of the line computer, or so I thought and paid for, and for what? A stupid Elmo doll won't even download from it? I agree with most of you when I say this doll is not worth the time, excitement anticipation, or money! It doesn't even deserve 1 star!"
1,No Good!!,"The negative comments in the previous reviews are all justified. This toy is . . . not so good. Yes, Elmo saying your kid's name is cool. But he only says about four other things, and he's frankly kind of hard to understand -- I've heard the story he tells six times now and I still can't get it. The download issues are also a big problem, as is the fur falling out. Oh, and the best part is Elmo calling out in the middle of the night wanting to play. Please. Buy something else."
5,What a great toy!!,"My daughter received ""Elmo Knows Your Name"" doll as a Christmas present. We were able to download the software and program the doll with no problems. The only critique I had was the disk had to download every name into my computer instead of just running the program off the disk. So it took quite some time for the download to complete. When my daughter first picked up Elmo and he said ""Hi, Marlee"", she was completely surprised and laughed so loud. Her reaction was priceless! I'm not sure why the other reviewers had such bad experiences with this toy. Based on our experience I would definitely recommend! This is a must have for any Elmo loving child!"
3,Son's name not in list,This toy is a great idea however my son's name is not in the long list of names...Peyton which is not a totally uncommon name.
1,Windows XP Issues,I have bought both the Elmo and the Pooh dolls and neither of them work right. I'm getting the same download error everytime. I have returned the dolls and re-purchased them at another store and got the same problem. I'm running Windows XP Pro with service pack 2 .......... I have been working with computers for about 14 years and I can not get this thing to work. I have even uninstalled Windows XP and re-installed it without service pack 1 or 2 and it still does not work. I don't think it's a problem with service pack 2 ........ I have read many reviews that states their doll worked on Win XP ...... I think it might be Windows XP Pro Edition. If you have a doll that works .....PLEASE POST WHAT VERSION WINDOWS XP YOUR USING. I would like to give this to my daughters for christmas.
3,"Fun toy, if you can get it to work","I was experiencing the same problem others have described with downloading the settings to Elmo. With the first doll, it would only play half the first song and then hang completely until the batteries were removed. We exchanged it for another and had similar problems -- this time more songs were loaded, but not everything. I couldn't imagine we had gotten TWO defective dolls, so I came here looking for answers.GOOD NEWS! After reading reviews here, I SHUT DOWN MY VIRUS SOFTWARE and a few other things running in my taskbar and tried again. This time I was able to successfully download all the settings to Elmo! I still got an error message at the end of downloading but this time the progress bar got to 100% and everything seems to function correctly.By the way, I am running XP with sp2, so it is possible to get it to work with XP."
2,Did not know my son's name...,"Elmo did not know my son's name. His name is Payton. Had some other very unusual names on there, names I have never heard of, but not Payton's. I called the 1-800 # and they are mailing me a fisher price credit and a postage paid envelope to mail him back."
1,Horrible,My wife and I tried two different computers and could not get either one to reconize that the elmo was connected. At least we found out before Christmas morning. I just went to the Fisher-Price help on-line and will be getting a postage paid return and will get a $40 voucher back. Now I just have to go find a replacement gift.
1,Why did I get this,why in the world did I tell my in laws to buy this stupid toy?Because it was cute and low and behold it said my sons name.so here we are 2 days before christmas and he is so excited when he opened it just to find out that it DONT WORK AT ALL. it gets to 98% then fails. Hello I think this is a problem. then I am reading all these post and seeing that everyone else is having the same problem. FISHER PRICE NEEDS TO RECALL THIS TOY.
1,Just wouldn't work! Elmo does not know your name...,"We hooked this thing up to 2 computers and Elmo never would do anything except say Happy Birthday Eck! My husband fixes computers for a living, so this was not user error. We returned it and got a replacement and had the same problem! Beware. The software is faulty."
1,single parents beware!!,"OMG! I bought this toy for my daughter Xmas 2005. I paid $39.99. It was very east for me to set up, i filled out her schedule and everything. the internal clock worked for about a day or so. we wake up at 5 but elmodidnt have that option. so I put 6am. Never the less, about a week later we are sound asleep and about 3 in the morning Elmo says,""Courtney, time to eat....blah blah,"" I jumped so far out of my bed and grabbed the kids ready to fly outta the door. Im a wicked light sleeper.. so for those single parents that are light sleepers and have to get early and do not want to be scared out of your PJ's this doll is not for you. The doll even sang Happy birthday to her LIKE 3 MONTHS too early...she was like, MA, its my birthday?...LOL..Its just not Worth the MONEY or the EAR PLUGS!!!"
1,Grrrrrr @ Elmo,"This came for my daughter's 2nd birthday. First of all, we had no issues downloading the software onto my very slooooow 90's computer. We input all of her favorites and loaded the doll itself. Very cute the first time he said her name. But now it's like what's the point in having this doll?*He is totally off 'schedule'. There is no reason for setting the schedule if he is just going to go off at all times of the night. It scared the bejesus out of me at 2:30 one morning when I heard it through my daughter's monitor saying ""Hey Makayla! Let's Play!"". Then during the daytime, he sings his night time songs.*In the 3 weeks we've had it, he has never mentioned her favorites but only once. That's just not sufficient for a toy I thought was supposed to be so great.*He never mentions any people in her life like myself or my fiance as we had programmed.This doll never gets played with, so I wonder if any toy store would want to take it back out of package because of all the defect reports?"
4,Fixing the Name Issue,Loving this toy. I can't speak to the install issues since it worked out of the box for me. If you've got a kid with a name that isn't in the database check out this post:http://geekgaming.blogspot.com/2005/12/what-to-do-if-elmo-doesnt-know-your_25.html
3,didn't want to program,"This is the 2nd ELMO that I have had. I couldn't program the first, so I exchanged it. Now this one won't program either. It goes all the way through the download and then says ""download failed"" I push the button and he starts to talk and then just quits. I tried changing the batteries, and that didn't help either. I am going to have to call Fisher-Price. I think that it will be a great toy once I get him working. Thats why I give 3 stars."
1,DON'T BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!,"Three days before Christmas I tried programming Elmo with Windows XP, no luck. Get's to 98% and fails. Before I read these reviews I thought it was the doll. I changed batteries, reinstalled software, uplugged and replugged cable, etc.... Returned doll and got another one. Same story...then I read these reviews, and then called Fisher Price. They were no help, the service rep agreed there have been some problems they are working on, but was not much help on how to fix. It's like oh well thanks for your money anyway. I'm very disappointed, my versions of Christmas morning have now changed, because this is one doll my daughter won't be playing with. Shame on you Fisher Price for putting out such a poor quality product. Don't waste your money on this toy."
4,Elmo is cool!,"I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading some of the programming issues others had with this toy. It couldn't be farther from the truth. I downloaded the program to my laptop running XP Home (using my household wireless connection) which only took a few minutes. I selected the pronunciation for my child's name and answered the programming questions (favorite food, color, etc.) and updated the program to Elmo. Stuffing the unit back inside of Elmo probably took longer than the programming did. I experienced absolutely no problems and have updated the unit once since the initial programming. The only improvement I would suggest is being able to select your child's name before downloading the software be cause it downloads ALL the names and that can take a while depending on your connection speed. My two year old loves the toy. Note - don't let your kid sleep with Elmo because if they roll on him he wakes up and starts talking in the middle of the night!"
4,Great! But needs a time fix!,"Over-all Elmo is great, however FP needs to find a solution for Elmo losing time. You set the time one day for something at 9 am, and every day he loses at least one-two minutes. Other than that its great!"
2,Dullsville,"Well, I was excited when Elmo came in the mail before my daughter's birthday but when I went to ""program"" it, I realized it was NOT Mac compatible. So poor little Ella did not get Elmo for her 2nd birthday. Instead I had to find someone with a PC. I gave it to her a few days later, and she was not impressed. She loves Elmo but I think a 3-D version of him that says her name kind of freaks her out."
3,Shhhh....Elmo,"I bought this for my 2 year old in February. While he loves that Elmo can say his name, as well as his sister's and brother's, he honestly has not gotten the amount of play out of it that I had hoped. (Great idea, just not an attention keeper)Not only that, Elmo eventually loses the time and ends up talking at 2 AM from the depths of the toy box and freaking out my son. Other than that, I have had no problems with setup or downloading changes and I have Windows XP and the SP2 update."
5,My Son Loves Elmo!!!!,"I don't know where all the negative reviews are coming from, but my son is in love with ELMO KNOWS YOUR NAME! I am so excited. I even told my co-worker and supervisor and they both got one! All of us agree that this toy is a must for any family, whether you like Pooh or Elmo. My son's face lights up when Elmo says his name, and sings the Alphabet, etc. He looks at my mouth because he thinks I must be saying all of these things. When I sing along, he realizes its ELMO!!!! What a great new toy to enjoy for generations. This will be a classic, like the Cabbage Patch Kids!"
1,Does not work - and I am not the only one.,"I tried to download the information to Elmo from my computer on two different systems (Windows 2000 and Windows XP Pro). It gets to the end and won't finish, telling me there is an error. I wasted too much time on a poor product. Don't believe me? Do your own Web search and see the complaints."
2,Very disappointing,"Forget what they promised about Elmo's ability to say over 100 things. He certainly doesn't say them all at one time! Not even close! As a matter of fact, he can only remember a total of 3 routines at any given time. In addition, there's something wrong with his internal clock, because Elmo kept waking up in the middle of the night singing or yelling at my son to wake up.He's a huge ELmo fan, but he played with this for less than a month."
3,Got it to work - here is what I did,"Upon first, second and thrid attempt and getting the ""download fail"" error, I tried something else.Unfortunately, my solution isn't for most people.My motherboard is an MSI K8N-FSR (AMD 64 bit, Nvidia)with onboard USB. When I used those ports, I got the error.In this computer I have installed another USB PCI card because it is the only USB card/ports that would work with a crappy MP3 player I refuse to get rid of. I plugged Elmo into that card and it worked.The card is an old Belkin Quarda port 1.1 USB PCI card. I bought it when the onboard USB ports (from a junky SIS chipset) on my HP Pavilion wounld't work with anything. A website called USBMAN suggested getting this card because it plain works.The toy itself is pretty neat. Hearing Elmo say her name is cool. Name list doesn't have her best friends name ""Niah"", but I understand it's a RARE name. Too bad Elmo won't speak by entering phonetics. Wish Elmo could be hacked to say other things..."
1,Good Luck if you buy this!,"My daughter got Elmo for her birthday and we've spent the past two days trying to get it to work. I finally got the program to load on a second computer (wouldn't work on our emachine, worked on an older Compaq laptop) and now it won't download to the doll. I've changed the batteries, etc. Fisher Price is going to send a pre-paid mailing label to exchange it, but how do I explain to my 2 year old that Elmo is going to go away for 6-8 weeks until we get another one?! And then, I don't even know if the second will work after reading all the awful reviews. My advice-Don't buy this toy! Or, if you do-Good Luck!UPDATE-I ended up exchanging the doll at the store for a new one. The second one would download from our Compaq laptop, but not from our e-machine. Good Luck!"
1,dowloaded fine... now it doesn't work!,"I got my info downloaded to Elmo with no problems. I was so excited to see my son's face when Elmo said his name on Christmas morning. But to my GREAT disappointment, when he opened it Elmo wouldn't say anything! I made sure it was switched on and still nothing. I changed the batteries 2 different times.... still nothing. My fun had been ruined. And now I have to hassle with Amazon to get this returned. What a bummer!"
3,Internal Clock Doesn't Work,"My son loves his Elmo doll. He loves to sing songs and play games with it. But the clock doesn't keep track of his daily rountine correctly. I went through all the steps to create his routine and downloaded the information to Elmo. For about 3 days, the time is correct. Then slowly, Elmo gains time. Soon his 8 am wake-up call is at 5 am. PROBLEM!!At one point, Elmo was telling us it was time for lunch at 3 am.Love the doll, but the programers need to figure out how to fix the problem."
1,Bait and switch,"Item advertised as Broan-NuTone Central Vacuum Low Voltage Hose 372. Item sent was generic junk knock off copy. Initial shipping took 14 days only to receive incorrect item. Return and refund processing took 21 days. Refund was only partial. I paid the advertised price for a NuTone hose, received generic junk hose, and did not get a full refund. Beware of this vendor!!!"
4,great help for a hike,"this book does exactly what it intends to do - accurately describe hikes in the mountains of Maine in a compact manner. The description I needed for the mountain I was climbing was right on, and the book is nice and easy to carry along for reference or for interesting technical reading. If you like Maine and you like climbing, this book is perfect."
2,"Nice Design, very disappointing longevity.","I bought this drill because I liked the design. The ergonomics are excellent and it feels like a quality unit. Unfortunately, it has not lived up to my expectations. The switch failed after less than a year, and Bosch kindly replaced the entire drill rather than repairing it. Now, however, the batteries are failing and they are just barely past their 18 month warranty limit, and of course a pair of new batteries cost nearly as much as the whole drill kit. I have a DeWalt 9.6v drill that's about seven or eight years old, and its original batteries are stronger than the Bosch's which are one-fifth as old. I understand that Bosch has bumped up the warranty on newer batteries to 2 years, but that's cold comfort to me."
3,good but just for review,"In my opinion it's not that good book for usmle since it doesn't give you neither enough pathology knowlege nor enough pathophysiology knowlege.However if you know pathology good, you can review it by this book quickly."
1,Disappointed,"I guess after reading Micro Made Rediculously Simple, my expectations for a review book are too high. This is just an outline w/ definitions, blah. There are very few images, and nothing to help you remember any of it. Also, I found it to be very incomplete when it came to the material covered by my pathology course."
2,OK if you just want to pass,"If you want to crush the competition on the boards then you need a more thorough text to study from. I reccomend Big Robbins or Concise Pathology (as a distant second). I memorized both of those and destroyed the boards. If you are only interested in going to Internal Med of Family or Peds, then the BRS is fine for you. But if you are a more Type A person who craves the harder residencies which require the highest level of cognitive ability such as Derm, Ortho, Radiology, and Plastics, then you better get a more rigorous book. Remember the goal is to crush the competition and you can't do it if you are reading the same books they are.I memorized Big Robbins and broke 255! You can too!"
4,Good review book,"Hi. I found this to be a good ""big picture"" (review) book, but the questions at the end of the chapters are too easy. Best to use with Robbins Path text and questions or this book is better substituted by the Goljan review book. Pick one and stick with it for review...to get best and timely results. Good luck!"
4,"An excellent review book for Step1, and companion for study.","Pathology is one of the most difficult courses in medical school. My medical school used Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease as have most for many years. The BRS book I found to be quite helpful for pathology class as I could read chapters before reading the corresponding chapter in Robbins or before going to class and retain a lot more the first time through it.I would definitely use this book to supplement pathology in medical school. Take notes in it and use it as a single resource along with First Aid to study for USMLE. I found that Robbins, Robbins pocket companion, Robbins Review of Pathology, and this BRS Pathology book were a winning combination for medical school pathology. The BRS book, filled with notes on relevant details not covered + First Aid was a winning combination for USMLE Step 1."
4,Good review for med school exams,"This book is great for a refresher and last minute cramming. It is divided into organ systems just like Robbins, and it gives you the key points for each subject. If your not a type A person who needs to honor everything, this may get you through med school exams. However, I would not depend solely on this book as a review for the boards."
1,"Warning - tiny, tiny print - can hardly read it!","This book is fantastic, but this edition sucks.As noted by another reviewer, the typography and the layout are terrible in this edition - buy some other version!"
1,Microscopic font.,"This is a hideous reprint of a brilliant book. I'm in publishing and this printing of Lajos Egri's opus from www.bnpublishing,net is likely the ugliest reprint I've ever seen. The publisher didn't even bother to format the pages or create indentations for new paragraphs. The text is all there scrunched into 134 unreadable pages."
4,A great guide,I bought this to help with fiction - specifically a novel I am working on - and it really helped.I highly recommend it. The concepts are different from many other books on writing and that iswhy they work.
5,"Educational, informative","Although this book is especially written for play writers, it's also good for those who write fiction. Loads of good information and the book has good explanations on how and why certain techniques work or don't work. I recommend this book without reservation."
2,Screenwriting evolves - Egri is full of himself.,"This is probably one of the most recommended works on the subject - which doesn't make it the best. Egri is often quoted for his ""...leads to ..."" premise.But like Freud, whose work was very self-indulgent, though evolutionary in its time, Egri gets caught up in himself andhis dictates as though carved from stone. For this reason, his material is static and closed-minded in a very dynamic field. People recommend him based on tradition or loyalty. ""It's a classic, so...""A better, more in touch read is Alex Epstein's Crafty Screenwriting. He is ego-free and bottom line. He writes in a humorous, conversational style that doesn't lecture or preach.AND...He's a PROCUCED writer, so he knows how to get it done."
2,Calling all editors...,"My edition is the most poorly edited book I have ever read. (Was the book self-published at Kinko's?)Also, the author's train of thought wanders as he writes, often confusing the point. Mr. Egri must have written this book in a single, caffeine-fueled sitting.Rewrite..."
2,no good,"The only positive thing it's real leather and cashmere. Otherwise do not go for it , these gloves look like they are from a discount store."
1,waste of time and money,it's doens't fit to be have this title.. don't expect it will help you pass the exam!
4,"Good by itself, better with other resources","I not only bought the book, but also bought the spreadsheet from the author's website that he put together with a PhD in Theoretical Astro-Physics. I am pretty certain that the author knows the numbers as well as anyone. That being said, his big thing in the book is not the valuation of individual players, but the competitive strategy between team owners. He uses quite a few poker examples which I happen to like, but the point is you are playing the personalities not just the numbers. I would recommend that you get this book in addition to a book like the Baseball Prospectus,the Forecaster, or Bill James' book. It would go well with any of them I think. I just don't think this is a substitute for everything you normally do like looking up projections by itself."
5,How winners think,"I was very impressed with this book. It not only gives you the proper way to evaluate players, comparing them against replacement players (not really the mean or average as suggested in another review), but it gives you a guide book for developing strategies. It is unrealistic to think that anyone can tell you what to do and you will win your league just like that. You have to develop your own strategy and do the research yourself. If you can't invest the time or don't know how to find the information, you're in trouble pal. This book shows you the possibilities and most importantly, shows you how a winning fantasy owner thinks. You not only try to figure out what your competition is doing, you try to confuse them and force them to do things they wouldn't normally do. Seems simple, but most teams don't approach it this way.Nice ESPN quote, but Karabell is still a total fantasy geek."
2,If you know nothing about fantasy baseball,"This book may be of help to a raw beginner, but even then be warned that it's mostly about auction leagues."
2,Not impressed,"This rapier looks great in the ad and it even looks great when you pull it out of the box, but the blade doesn't even stand under its own weight. I held the sword out horizontally and you'd think the blade was made of rubber. Also, the scabbard is 'generic' and too short for the blade and there is no clasp to fasten to belt or baldric. I wasn't impressed but I guess you get what you paid for."
3,wall hanging,this sword-like object is actually quite nice looking. I have it hanging on my wall. it looks nice and has a good weight to it.
5,Love this and so does my baby boy!,"I used Brainy Baby with my first child a girl and here I am 6 years later with our second a boy and he loves it just as much as she did! All my friends kids love it and even adults!! It's mesmerizing, entertaining and very educational!"
3,Great music...beautiful singer with a so-so voice,"Unfortunately, Arielle Dombasle doesn't quite have the voice to pull this off. I like her selection of songs, and her accompaniment is exquisite. She even does a good job some of the time. It's those other times, when she's flat, that really detract from your listening pleasure. The good moments outnumber the bad, or I would pan her altogether.""Rhum and Coca-Cola"" and ""Whispering"" are my two winners for this album. The vocals needed to be honed (or fixed with ""studio magic"") before some of these were released to the public. I got the feeling that Dombasle was trying to channel Edith Piaf at times, but she's no Edith Piaf."
2,No Amor,"It probably is my taste, but I got the CD based on what someone else said, and the person and I must have far different tastes. I thought she was mediocre at best. Not the fault of Amazon, of course. My fault."
5,A Handy Reference For Lovers Of Shakespeare Or Of Dachshunds,"If you've ever been thinking of one of Shakespeare's major plays (a dozen are included here) and can't quite bring to mind one of the character names or plot twists, this book will give you the information you need in minutes. Or if you love dachshunds and want to see them portrayed by someone who genuinely loves them and is genuinely witty, then you can enjoy this book even if you know nothing of Shakespeare and care less. It may have been published as a tool for teachers, but it deserves to be a crossover classic."
2,"The worst one of the series, but a bit of a better ending.","Pamela Springsteen makes another slashing perfomance as Angela, the murderous happy camper. She disguises herself as a teenage camper(typical). Then she realises that the campsite has changed from Camp Rolling Hills to a new name called Camp New Horizons, changing it to outdoor camping dividing campers to three different management teams. One by one Angela massacres them. Carries a very weak plot, but good dialogue scenes by Tracy Griffith (Melanie's half sister and star of ""The First Power"") and the guy she meets and gets to knows. Michael J. Pollard (""Bonnie & Clyde"") is also featured in this film, and gets to act as crazy as ever! There's also a heavy metal track during the closing credits called ""Sleepaway"" by John Altyn(whoever he is!). A part 4 should've been made. The director of this slasher film, with most of the cast, moved on to star in a teenage sex comedy called ""Fast Food."""
2,"Don't buy, just rent","This movie isn't worth the money they are asking for, but this movie is pretty good for a laugh, it isnt the worst horror film ever, but not really that good, I gave it 2 stars, because I have to be fair, my advice to someone is, dont buy it if you want to see it , just rent it. Even though this movie doesnt have a plot, or has a good twist, it might at least be worth checking out.."
1,Utter Trash (Worst Slasher film ever created),I saw this movie on on demand and I would have to say it is the worst slasher film I had ever seen. The characters are really bad in this movie. The killer is a boney 115 5'5 girl. The way she kills people is so weak. She beat a guy up with a large stick but it looks so weak. It does not even look like it would hurt you. And he some how dies. The movie also made it seem like she kills only bad guys bad guys but she kills everyone. Most of them did nothing. Don't know why the director seem to hint that she kills only the bad. And it is not even scary at all. It takes place for the most part in the day time. And the killer is the main character making no suspense at all. I would recommend to everyone to aviod this movie at all cost. It is so stupid. I really don't see what the priase the other reveiws gave is all about. All I can say is it is UTTER TRASH!!!!!
1,NOTHIN' BUT TALK,I WATCHED THIS ENTIRE DVD AND SAW NOTHING. IT'S ONLY DIRECTORS NARRATING WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHY. THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL. I THINK THIS WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY AND TIME. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS ONE TO ANYONE.
2,Uhhhhh.....NO,"Honestly, I can't really remember the first two becauseit has been so long since I seen them.... But I doubtthis one was the best. We have Bruce Springsteens sistergoing around killing all the teens in the camp thatcommits sins. Well, I'll say that there is a few semioriginal killings here. But there is no reason to rootfor anyone in the film other than the killer. The asiangirl is totally annoying as is the rest of the cast.This movie in some ways attempt to be a horror movie andin other ways it wanted to be a spoof movie. Reality isthat it failed on both accounts as it isn't scary orreally that funny."
3,A good friday popcorn movie,this movie is the kind you watch on friday night with the lights out and popcorn sit back and enjoy this fun slasher movie.
3,THIS FILM IS TEENAGE WASTELAND FUN !!!!!!,"SLEEPAWAY CAMP III - TEENAGE WASTELAND is much like the second film. Pamela Springsteen is back as Angela only this time, she kills a girl, steals her identity and goes to the new camp with a new set of campers on the same grounds where Angela murdered her victims the year before. An appropiate subtitle, this is a good film to watch if youhave an hour and a half to waste. Teenage Wasteland fun !!!!This film is presented for the first time in 1.85:1 widescreen and the sound and picture quality are good for a film that was made on a very low budget.Get your copy today!!!!!"
4,Pretty good,Angela's back once again played by Pamela Springteen to kill anyone who does something no where as good as part 1 and not as good as part 2 but a pretty good sequel.
2,Kind of Dumb,"Out of all the Sleepaway Camp movies, I'd say that this one was the kind of dumb one. Part 1 was the best, part 2 was okay, and part 3 was a materialistic and not very scary."
2,Lifeless and awkward figure illustrations,"The illustrations have some really good qualities and some really bad qualities. As for the good, the landscapes, atmosphere and color are nicely done. The detail is at times excellent.As for the bad, the rendering of the figures is poor throughout, and the faces are worst of all. The gestures are unnatural and often lack the energy and tension expected of the scene. Gandalf, for example, on the bridge before the Balrog, merely holds his staff and looks nowhere in particular as the monster looms right over him. The hobbits always look...well excuse the term but, constipated, or half asleep, or just down right ugly. The features are severe, hard and homely. One lady, rather than beautiful and graceful looks like an effeminate man. The one exception is that Galadriel is very well done, and much better looking than the acress in the upcoming movie.Overall I'm disappointed."
4,Nice Case,"If your in the market of a full tower aluminum case look no further (nice plug) all kidding aside, i bought this paticular case for few reasons 1) Upgrade 2) Water-cooled 3) Show + Tell. This case also comes in silver VA7000SWA. I not sure if they offer this model with powersupply included, but in case your wondering NO POWERSUPPLY at the time I purchace it. The case came in orginal shipping box so instructions an hardware was included.The 'see through' honeycomb side panel is just that there is no plastic cover it totally exposed.Comes also with two sets of keys to lock-out unwanted guests/friends.Plenty of room an space,pre-cut holes for most water cooled devices,all in all i give it 4-stars, there was no real accentives or coupons/discounts if you were to purchace there power supply or cooling devices just little write up on fanless supply which of course they recommended."
5,I LOVE THIS CASE!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just built my second computer and decided to go with this case. Let me tell you,"" It's NICE."" It's a full tower. I did not realize how tall it was and it would not fit under my desk until I took the feet off the bottem of the case, it fits like a charm. Everything runs cool with the extra space inside and it looks cool at night or when the lights are off too!If you're considering this case get it you wont be disappointed.PS; It's water-cooled compatible also!"
2,Do not buy!!,"My husband and I are avid fisherman and we purchased 4 of these rods. Before we could even go fishing the tip broke off one. After fixing that, we were fishing and the first fish my husband tried to land with one broke the rod in half about 3inches from the joint! These rods are not very sturdy. We ended up replacing them all after that. Fortunately we had no more problems after replacing them! We will now only use these for Crappie!"
3,nothing special,"its a good solid fan, easy to install. i find mine very quiet and works just fine. no problems at all after a few months"
1,"Good product, but bad shipping & handling.",I would buy this product elsewhere. I ordered it and waited for 4 weeks within a product. Go somewhere else
1,Not so great,"This fan lasted me about 2 months before it was damaged mysteriously. Something happened with the wiring, I guess that's what you get for a cheap product."
3,It's just okay,"It's not the best TNA dvd out there, it's not the worst. I think this PPV should be better. My main reason to buy this DVD is to witness Judas Messiah (Ricky Banderas) taking on Abbys.The matches are okay. Most memorable, Kurt Angle vs Christian Cage which is an overall good and entertaining match. For the emotive part of it, Gail Kim vs Awesome Kong was also good. The DVD is entertaining, but isn't the best around of TNA but if you want to see TNA and just want an overall experience, this DVD should deliver ok.The extras are almost gone: just a photo slide show and another Gail Kim vs Awesome Kong match on Impact! Besides that, there's nothing much left. Other DVD's have featured more cool extras. This one is somewhat lame.3 stars out of five. The three stars mainly for the Angle vs Cage match which hands down is the best on this DVD."
5,One of the best,It just doesn't get better than this CD. I've had it for a long time and it's still one of my favourites. Pop it in the car on a sunny Saturday afternoon and nothing can go wrong. I can't recommend it enough.
5,A 90s Classic,"For a recording that is 7 years old now, this classic has lost none of it's luster. In Buffalo, The Lowest of the Low have a cult status, and on any given night at The Rendezvous Room, it's guaranteed that you'll hear more than a few playing off ""Shakespeare, My Butt..."" on the jukebox. Take modern rock, a little roots and give it a good leftist Canadian spin and you have music that sounds as good today as when we heard it the first time. This one is always in my CD changer - one of the very few that deserve to be in yours!"
4,Great book but not for beginners,"I am a college student enrolled in a figure drawing class. My instructor told me to get any figure drawing book, so I got this one. The author does amazing work with his tone and shading, but I did not find it useful for the basic fundamentals to figure drawing. This is a book for people with figure drawing background who want to improve their style."
5,"Exquisite reproductions, excellent advice",Ryder is one talented guy. The reproductions in this volume are testament to his talent and are worth the price of the book alone. But you get much more than that with very well thought out lessons and how to's on figure drawing.
2,not much to emulate here,"I'm a beginning artist, and I ordered this book for tips and guidelines to help me in my upcoming figure drawing class. After a brief perusal I've decided not to try any of the author's techniques and suggestions, mostly because his own drawings, as reproduced in the book, are so flat and dull. My own beginning classmates' drawings have more weight and energy. Try another book--I certainly plan to."
2,More about the artist than about learning to draw,"The artist seems more impressed with his own skill than in helping anyone try to learn how to draw.The book has beautiful drawings and is a handsome book in general. It shows the authors work in an interesting way.It is hardly a ""complete guide to figure drawing: a contemporary perspective on the classical tradition"" as it claims in the title.Most of the text is empty of real meaning.I would not recommend it to a friend."
4,Thank God for an excellent figurative painter!,"Ryder's book is a delight to leaf through, looking at the excellent life drawings in red earth, done with the same accuracy and passion as the masters of the past.He gives a very clear account of how to tackle the drawing in phases, until it is finished.I would have rated the book a solid 5, were it not that in my opinion Ryder spends too little time giving advice on how to measure proportions, which are the basis of a successful life drawing or portrait. He is undoubtedly a masterful draftsman, but the less experienced artist reading his book would expect to be led step by step on such an important aspect of drawing from life."
1,A Lemon?,"Maybe it's just a lemon, but it sure is a piece of junk. I won't waste my money on Bosch tools again. This drill-driver was good for one season, facing a block wall with redwood siding. It was not that much driving. This year it has one speed: drill. If I'd wanted a drill I could have gotten it cheaper. Thank goodness our old driver isn't completely dead yet."
2,"For people who really, really, really have time to cook",These recipes take a lot of preparation time.
5,Queen: Days of Our Lives{Blu-ray},Wow! I love this blu-ray. I have loved Queen since I was in high school in the 80's. This documentary tells a great story of the greatest band ever. The quality is great and Roger and Brian are so funny but very sincere. I love all the stories of how they wrote the songs. Well done. I know for sure that if GOD sang his voice would be Freddie Mercury. Queen Forever.
3,Good documentary...but where are the other bonus scenes?,"I'm a major Queen fan and bought this thinking I was gonna expect more bonus footage from this documentary...and boy was I wrong! When I saw this item on UK/European online stores, I found out that other bonus scenes were left out of the US version of this DVD. You won't find scenes like 'Brian's Health Scare 1974', 'Freddie Legless', 'Queen: The Beginning', 'Making Videos', and 'Queen on Tour 1974-1975' on this US version of the DVD. This just ain't fair for us the US Queen fans to have less than what we would've liked to see from this documentary. Especially from a documentary of one of the most legendary rock bands in history that is Queen! This is kind of a let-down for me."
3,"Very decent,but could be so much more!","This is a gripe to the ""powers"" that be,Queens 40th anniversary could have been really special.Instead of just remastered cds and this extended version dvd there could have been all sorts of classic concert footage(1973-1980)released in volumes which I'm sure fans wouldve eaten up!Its out there(Ive got many a bootleg to prove it!),why not put it out? ""Fire at the Bowl"" and ""We will Rock You"" are great and all,but 80's Queen were nowhere as intense as 70's Queen! That said,this is a decent release with a ""little"" extra live footage added on.Why they didnt add more cocert footage and (way less!)interview is beyond me."
5,BEST VIRTUAL PET IN HISTORY!!!,"Tamagotchi's are great for both kids...and parents!!! The infrared is awsome,I get to connect with my sister's tamagotchi.So if you think they're weird... YOU'RE WRONG!!! reminder: please get a TAMAGOTCHI!!!"
5,"POWERHOUSE PLANER, AWESOME","THIS PLANER FEELS AND RUNS AS IF IT IS PLUGGED INTO A POWER OUTLET. IT HAS LOTS OF TORQUE AND IS AS SMOOTH AS ANY CORDED PLANER I HAVE EVER USED. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS TOOL, I WOULD SUGGEST GETTING IT AND THE CORDLESS JIGSAW AS WELL. THEY HAVE REPLACE MY CORDED ONES, AND WORK BETTER THAN I HAD EVER EXPECTED. I AM A CARPENTER BY TRADE, AND HAVE USED MANY NAME BRAND TOOLS, BOTH ROUGH AND FINISH TOOLS. THIS PLANER KICKS BUTT."
5,Totally Excellent!!!!!!,A great addition to your Bosch tool line up. Works great and has plenty of power and controls to do a nice job.
5,A great book,"This is a great book to understand the principles of wings, stability and structures, I recommend for the ones who does not know a lot about aeronautics and want to know a bit about it."
3,GO USAF Academy,I would assume the only people buying this go to the air force academy or are taking classes that they really shouldn't be at another university.
4,her best friend loves her,"I think I most loved this book because I married my own best friend - who I had no idea was in love with me. So this book melted my heart. I stayed up all night to finish this book. While it's not lofty literature, it IS a sweet romance. It's got the classic frustration of unrequited love, only the man is the frustrated one in love while the woman remains clueless to his feelings. The romantic tension is there. With one mis-timed kiss our hero puts thoughts into the head of our heroine. He thinks she will always think of them only as friends, so he goes about trying (but not succeeding) in trying to forget how he feels about her. And she, starts to notice him...I'm trying NOT to give everything away for you, and hope I'm doing a good job of convincing you to try this one out. I know I was glad for this impulse purchase!"
4,Forget about Katy,"Focus more on the people behind the songs, thus the name of the production team and the album. The Matrix. Katy's put to good use and she showed back in 2004 that she's got chops, but the musical gifts the writers share is what personally drew me to this album, and it's worth it. Although if you only want to try out one song, go for ""Would You Care"". I'll be damned if anyone can find me a more melodically wonderful pop song. My favourite song of 2009 unfortunately squandered the rest of the album's play-time on my iPod until recently. But the whole album is classy and should have been #1. I just wish Katy would put Would You Care on her next album. It's terrific."
1,Safe T-Shapes for the Tub or Shower,"Didnt like this product at all..Did what the directions said, let them dry and stick for a couple of days before using the shower and once I got in the shower and turned on the water, all the appliques, moved all over the floor of the shower stall.. So I just put them on the back splash walls for a decoration. I didnt like this product at all, but I did like the star shaped."
2,non stick stickers,only last a short time in the tub even tho i cleaned tub and used alcohol wipes befor sticking them down. think product sat on the shelf too long paper backing looked discolored when i recieved package.
3,these are really big t's!!!,"I ve purchased 3 of these t-shirts but they are iether to long or just to big, they are beautifully designed but the shirt itself is not very flattering."
3,Dog loves. VERY STINKY,"I've purchased these bully sticks many times before but this last shipment is incredibly stinky! Stinky like something the dog pulled out of the cat's litter box stinky! I've only given one stick so far, hoping that they aren't all like this..."
2,Strong smell,"My dog really seems to enjoy these, but the smell is absolutely awful. We've had bully sticks from other manufacturers that didn't have a noticeable smell, but these smell like rotting fish--this is not an exaggeration. We will not be purchasing these again when we run out."
4,My dog loves these bully sticks.,My 10lb. eight month old puppy loves chewing on these sticks. He's a busy guy and these sticks keep him happy for long stretches of time. The only reason I didn't rate these 5 star is because of the smell which surprised me but won't keep me from buying again.
5,Best price for bully sticks,"My pup loves bully sticks. I have tried s few brands including theFerrera Farms 6 Inch Regular Bully Stick, 7-Count bag (Pack of 2). He liked these just as much, and they are much cheaper. Kinda stinky but I have not found any bully sticks that weren't stinky! Although the length is pretty uniform, they vary a lot in width. Just letting you know in case that matters to you."
3,"Long lasting, bad smelling","This is the second brand of bully sticks we bought for our dogs. I like that they're pretty similar in size/thickness and unlike the other brand, they don't have random 'flaps' of who knows what. That said, these are awful smelling. The previous brand I purchased had an odor but not too bad. This brand is rather foul smelling."
1,smell really bad,My dogs love these but I recommend odor free. I couldn't handle the smell and didn't want them on the furniture they smell that bad.
5,Quality chews,"As the other reviews state, these things are quite pungent. We keep them in a ziploc bag and it does a good job of holding the smell in. Our dog loves, them, though, and they last many times longer than some of the cheap chews that we've gotten. We'll be purchasing more of these in a month or two, once our dog gets through this bag."
3,Good,"My Dogs really like them but they certainly don't last for a very long time or how long a ""real"" bully stick should. Smelly. Very smelly. Be prepared to smell them on your dogs fur, etc. even days later."
3,SO STINKY!!,Great value but only if you don't mind the bully sticks smelling like pee. These bully sticks smell like the orifice from which they were created. Air them out or else your bully stick will really smell like the wieners they originally were.
4,Great chew sticks,"This is better for smaller dogs as my larger dogs (50-60 lbs.) can get through these with no problem. Going to go with the 12"" ones next time but the bully sticks are a good quality and my dogs loved them."
1,Stinky Stick,Con: I buy normally another brand of Bully sticks but this time I thought what a great deal . To my surprise the bully stick stink to high heaven. I would never buy them again.Pro: If you have an outside dog there would be great .
5,My Puppy Loves These,"This product, while my puppy's breath doesn't smell that good after she chews on them, is a perfect alternative to her chewing on the baseboards in the house or on my leather shoes."
4,Could use some more bang for the buck!,"Seemed as though we got shorted on the number of sticks. Dogs like them and we have always like this product. Would be nice if it came from the USA though especially in light of the whole debacle with foodstuffs from China because we would NEVER want to do harm to our little 4 legged best friends. One of the reasons we stuck with Cadet (IMS) is that Costco carried them and we trusted Costco's sources although for the same price Costco had more poundage(and I have no stock in Costco so this is not an advertisement)Large Bull Sticks, 1 Lb"
1,Too smelly!!,"I've ordered the 12 inch thinner sticks for my dog before and he loves them. I ordered these by accident last time (wasn't paying enough attention!!) and although the dog still loves them they smell incredibly bad! The longer, thinner sticks no not have this bad smell (unless you stick them right by your nose I suppose). As soon as I opened the pack of these sticks the smell infused the entire house and when I gave the dog one his paws carried the horrible smell for days afterward. I finally put him in the sink and washed his paws.I'd recommend the longer 12 inch sticks over these simply for the smell. I ended up just throwing this pack out and ordering the longer ones."
3,Doesn't Last Long,"The price on these is great, and they don't smell as bad as other brands we have purchased in the past - but our 25lb Corgi mix polished one off in 6 minutes flat! The first one we gave him, we left the room for a few minutes and when we came back it was gone... we thought he stashed it somewhere and looked high and low to find it in the living room. So we decided to give him a 2nd one and actually time it... completely gone in 6 minutes, no joke. Other brands have lasted him at least half an hour, usually longer."
2,Awful smell but dog enjoyed,"These bully sticks stunk so badly that after I gave two of them to my 70 pound dog, he almost smelled like the sticks! Needless to say, I gave the remainder of them to a man whose dogs live outdoors. The price wasn't worth it as I went to a local store and paid three times as much for some bully sticks, but they didn't smell."
3,Some were very thin,"This package seemed a bit uneven. Some were very normal to above normal in thickness, but some were very small and skinny."
1,They stink!,"These things literally stank so bad, we had to throw them away! We thought that they were a good value, so we'd give them a try, but that was a really bad idea. I think the one we gave our dog to see if she'd like it has scarred her for life. She used to love bully sticks all the time, now she'll only eat them (another and better brand) if she is bored or has nothing else better to do. These are a waste of money and they stink!"
5,Dogs love 'em!,"My two pups are crazy about these Bully Sticks and chew them into oblivion! The Bully Sticks are sort of smelly, but maybe that is what adds to the appeal for them. My dogs are both small. One is 4 years and the other maybe one year. (I adopted her about 6 months ago from the shelter.) They will spend hours chewing them - especially the younger dog. She may still be getting her permanent teeth."
4,Super Reader,"The Devil is really pretty sneaky. That will be no shock to anyone. Von Bek is a mercenary, and a very dangerous man and a bit of a lost soul, both figuratively and literally.The Devil has a deal for him. If he can find him the Holy Grail, he can have his soul back."
4,Esoteric book,"Fantasy? Otherwordly story? Theological? Does it and others by Michael Moorcock have a ""cult following""?I read it decades ago and have purchased it again for a person who I think will appreciate it. Not everyone would or could.Seller is good, sent fast and packaged well."
5,Moorcock's best?,"I agree. This is an excellent novel - a classic, really - and in my opinion Moorcock's finest moment. Von Beck's quest to find the Holy Grail for a repentant Lucifer is a moving a highly successful attempt to bridge Fantasy and Historic Fiction. Credible and thoroughly-researched background, well-developed and evolving characters, lush settings, great dialog and action. Buy it as a stand-alone novel - Moorcock's sequel 'City In the Autumn Stars' pales in comparison, and the third in the 'trilogy' - a short story - isn't worth mentioning; more of his base profiteering I'm afraid. Surely not in the league of this fine literature ... bring yourself together, man!"
3,The great Color zoo!,"Its a good book that teaches the basic things of learning. It teaches about colors, geometric figures, and about animals. I recomend this book for kids agea 6-4 that a bearly learning english ,or little guys that do know."
4,Color Zoo,"Excellent book that can have a relatively long useful life for the intended age group. Good gift for parents, especially if it can be used by more than one child."
4,Pretty but boring,"This book is exquisitely beautiful. However, it's not useful from an educational standpoint because the animals are so abstracted that they all morph into one indistinguishable creature. Maybe when my kid is older..."
5,"Beautiful, Fun, & Educational","I loved this book (1) because it uses primary colors which my daughter adores (2) the animals are very imaginative (3) it teaches so many things (4) it's cardboard, almost impossible for my one year old to destroy.The excerpts this site gives you doesn't do it any justice. It's very hard to see what it's really like. I suggest going to a bookstore and picking it up to flip through it so you really understand. I think it's brillant!"
5,the touggest most durable cordless drill,"I love bosch woodworking products and they know have cordless drills worthy of the bosch name. This product is the best. Not only does it have more power and torque than I could ever use, It is the the most durable product I have ever bought. It will withstand drops of 4 stories and will not break.Goodbye to all of my Dewalt."
1,Not good with an ultrasound!,"I purchased a bottle of this to use with my ultrasound device. Its sticky and drags after a minute or two and you need to apply it way too often.................avoid for ultrasound use! After two minutes, what was left on the skin was a light tacky film and I had applied a generous amount to being with."
2,Not poofy,"Pros:The petticoat was made fine,craftsmanship was not lacking. Clean fast shipping.Cons:It was teeny only a couple layers was more of a slip than a petticoat and the pictures on the page were misleading to this effect. It came shipped in a small envelope if that gives you a sense of scale."
4,He know us all to well,"Nick Earls has a great way of letting us into his main charaters head. He grabs you and takes you for a ride in. A nice lazy ride through the romances and heart breaks of the main character in a way that we can laugh along even as we feel for him. He makes you want to kick the guys as he goes through things that seem all to familiar. Once you read one of his book you will want to get the lot Bachelor Kisses, Head games and the new one Perfect Skin are a must"
5,Great book for novice painters,"I highly recommend this book for quilters, novice painters.I love painting on canvas, but I never thought about painting on fabric before.This book is fantastic. If you like quilting, it offers great advice for making panels for quilting. I discovered painting t-shirts through this book. It offers many suggestions for techniques you can use. One of my favorites is scattering material with salt. You can use various size salt - sprinkle a bit of table salt around a painting, sprinkle sea salt chunks over the painting, get some snow salt pieces, break them into smaller pieces (though use the pieces that are larger than the sea salt chunks) and sprinkle them around. Mist with a water mister bottle. The effects are beautiful.Please be advised that the book teaches rather abstract paintings, and shows how to use pieces for quilting. However, some of the other reviewers tell readers, ""I never knew that I could paint before."" Mickey Lawler (sp?) really does make it easy."
5,Excellent information!,"This is a wonderful book for anyone venturing in to fabric painting. Mickey Lawler's fabrics are exquisite, and her instructions clear. Too bad this book is out of print!"
5,Beautiful ideas!,I've been wanting this book since I took a workshop on fabric painting - now to clean up my studio so I can mess it up again!
5,Skydyes by Mickey Lawler,Skydyes: A Visual Guide to Fabric PaintingI purchased this for a friend who had been unable to get it in N.Z. through book stores. It arrived very promptly and she is delighted with it. Judi Exton.
5,SkyDyes by Mickey Lawler,An excellent resource written by one of the experts in the field of fabric dying.
3,i read this book in 2003,"i read this book in 2003, when i was 16 years old, and it changed my perception of how women could write and what women could write about. i think that's all i really need to say."
2,WALKING SHOES,I'VE OWNED THESE SHOES FOR THREE WEEKS AND I WALK WITH THEM ALMOST EVERY DAY AND THEY STILL FEEL STIFF. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MEDIUM BUT THESE SHOES ARE VERY NARROW AND CRAMP MY FEET. DEFINITELY NOT AS COMFORTABLE AS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE.
2,To much roll,"I've been looking for a good pair of walking shoes. I tried these but found they had too much roll side to side. To be fair, I had this same problem with a previous pair of walking shoes with the 'air cushion' type of sole. They were comfortable but not stable enough."
2,Poorly made,"I have this garage kit and was disappointed. The end that attaches into the wall is poorly made and the metal would repeatedly stick in the receptacle. The only way I was able to utilize this hose was attached to another. The attachments are great though and if you can get around the way the plug in end is made, it's garage worthy."
4,Great vaccuum kit but just one wish,"My friend bought this hose kit for his garage and also uses it for the entire downstairs of his house including cleaning out his fireplace cinders; no clunky vaccuum to drag around and the noise of the motor stays out in the garage. I was sold on the versatility it offers so I bought one for my townhouse. I can clean my car; my garage; the hose stretches to the kitchen and my wash room; and to the sunroom when the dog tracks in mud and debris. This was a great purchase and my entire first floor, garage and car stay fresh and clean. I just wish they had a more aggressive carpet attachment (rotating bristles would be nice.) That way, I could really use it like a ""central vac"" system in my house. I'd NEVER drag out the vaccuum for the carpet again!"
1,Windows 98 SE drivers not on the CD !!,"I got this external HD as a Christmas present, and tried to install it prior to a full back-up (which I NEED to do !!), but the included CD does not have the drivers for Windows 98 SE (or, non-SE, for that matter)in spite of Teac advertising the drivers are included!I send an email to Teac support.. let's hope they can help as the links on their web page are not working."
1,PURE CRAP!,Long. Drawn out. Boring. Barely any nudity. A complete waste of time for a 70's horror flick.
4,At last !,"Its good to see the Naschy movies being released here in the states (although at a slow pace). This one was long over due as the butchered version known as Werewolf Vs. The Vampire Woman is such a bad print its hardly worth watching. The DVD treatment of Werewolf Shadow is quite good in its uncut/unedited wide screen glory. While these movies are not for everyone there is a following for them. If you are a Naschy fan you will enjoy this one even though Curse Of The Devil is a bit better in my estimation. A werewolf,vampires and nude cuties. Whats not to love?"
3,fast-moving and crazy,"In the interview that comes on the DVD, Paul Naschy says that Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman was the movie that made him a horror buff. You can see that inspiration in Werewolf Shadow - right down to recreating the opening sequence. In fact, despite the gore and nudity that punctuates the plot, this film is a lot like those old Universal Horror movies of the forties. Despite some boring stretches (particularly in the restored sequences) and some trite dialogue, the film moves along at a brisk pace and contains some impressive (if not scarey) images - such as the Countess, all dressed in flowing black, fleeing back to her tomb, her mummified undead assistant attacking the heroine in the ruined castle, and a recently vamped girl appearing in a corridor all aswirl with mist. The final fight between the werewolf and the vampire Countess is a bit of a let down, but up til then things haven't been too bad at all."
3,Solid Micro-House/Minimalist Techno,"A solid roundup of clean, tweaky, microhouse techno tracks.For those unfamiliar, it's minimalist techno with just a few dashes of house - very few dashes."
4,The Gymnast,"I recommend this movie. If U like Imagine You & Me, you will appreciate this film. The aerials scences are fantastic."
5,"Exceptional, Heart warming,,,,,",This was an exceptional movie compared to many movies I have seen and found to be low budget. I highly recommened this to anyone looking for a movie to keep you interested. It is of strength and courage and the true endurance of two women once they have truely found each other. Very well done. A wonderful ending. Are there more movies like this from the same producers? Thank you amazon for suggesting it from my previous orders.
3,The Gymnast,"""The Gymnast"" was interesting, creative and beautiful from an athletic/ poetic point of view. As far as the love-story went; it seemed realistic which is sometimes not always the happiest ending. I liked it enough to watch twice to see what I missed the first time. I would conmmend it to anyone who like gymnastics, gymnasts, or creative dance."
3,Real life stuff,This was a good movie... it was realistic and more like real life. The end of the movie was a bit slow.I liked this movie.
2,Another straight women's forray in and pull back,The picture on the cover would lead you to believe this is a lesbian love story. It's not. It's another tired straight women wants to but then she doesn't want to... Should be rated PG.
4,The Gymnast,"Movie was not what i expected....Very good, but left for wanting more.. happy ever after???, an emotional response...."
3,Not what I expected.,"The gymnast. Not bad, but not great. From the preveiw I saw, I expected more from the movie. Was a little slow, but the story was good. Just saw it as being long for what the story was about. It was not a ""lesbian"" movie really. More about the trials of sport. I will watch it again, but for now it can wait."
1,Waste of time,"Compared to lesbian cinema over all, it is bad. Compared to movies generally, it is awful, painful, embarrassing, un believable, full of disconnections, argh!!!! The main protagonist is boring. The marriage is boring, the relationship... dull. THe tension, absent. The best thing about it is if you like looking at very buff women."
1,"Nice acrobatics, Bad romance","While it may look so entacing the sad truth is anyting but, so if you want to see great acrobatics I slightly recomended other than that the drama department in this movie is plainly horrible."
2,Lesbian exploitation film about gymnastics,"As beautiful as the blond gymnast is an as talented,I really don't like this sort of film for the content.The acting and plot are well done."
3,not bad,"this film was ok. the acting wasn't great. the story was one that i feel several people could identify with, but took too long to unfold. if you're looking for a lot of lesbianism in a film this is not what you're looking for. this movie centers on a woman who is unhappy with her life (marriage, no children, failed childhood dream) and while she is looking to recapture some of that childhood glory finds herself falling in love with a lesbian."
5,"I love it, but . . .","I have to disagree a little bit with the other reviewers. I love Jim's Journal, and I laugh and laugh when I read it--especially when I read it with my friend Carolyn. But it's not the kind of humor that everyone appreciates. In fact, some perfectly good people don't find it funny at all. Not much happens. You may or may not like that style of humor."
4,"Not as good as Flogging Molly, Like someone suggested","Okay, i just saw these guys with Flogging Molly and Street Dogs. These guys were great!! I just listened to the cd today and I have to admit they are much better live than on record. Live they reminded me of early flogging molly, a little, but without the irish singer and the cool instruments. On record, they are more like Against Me! which isn't a bad thing, I just wished the cd sounded like they do live is all. Great band, check 'em out!!"
3,not good enough,"this book is not worth to buy, it only teach you linear algebra and calculus, you can get better book in your collage, so save your money to buy some standard math book , i give 3 stars because it has some openGL equations. but not much"
4,Excellent source of applications for a Calc III class,"If you're trying to find examples of 3D vector operations (dot and cross products, especially) that keep the interest of a mixed class of 18-25 year olds, this book is a fantastic source. If you're approaching the topic from the point of view of a programmer, trying to acquire the necessary math, it may be a bit dense. I'm sure many of the examples are now out-of-date, compared to current 3D implementations, but I learned quite a bit, anyway."
2,Disappointment : much to basic,"When I read the reviews of this book, I thought this book would finally help me find heights on triangles (eg.terrains), and other stuff I thought would be in a book like this... Okay, there are cool articles on shadow volumes and other...But I think the book isn't complete enough. It should have been more complete...(PS: Sorry for any bad English, I'm Dutch)"
4,Very good book...,"If you hate math this book is not for you. However, if you like math and are interested in actually learning the fundamentals that drive 3-D engines, you will find this book interesting. As stated by others already, it reads like a math text book and there is almost no code in it, however since it is a math book, this shouldn't really be a surprise. If you actually take the time to understand whats going on on every page, you'll walk away with a wealth of knowledge that will aid you in programming your own 3-D engine."
4,Not vintage Musselwhite but still powerful,"The CD includes some country tunes, so if you're a blues purist you'll be dissapointed. His harp playing is, as always, inspired and his vocals excellent."
3,Not what I was expecting,"First off, this is my first CD by Mr. Musselewhite, so I'm no expert - but I was pretty disappointed. I had heard such great things about him being a blues harp pioneer and I was really looking forward to hearing some hard driving blues. Instead, I got this pseudo country thing. Maybe more experienced fans are ready for that, but it is not what I was looking for. I'll keep looking because there are hints of really cool stuff on this CD, just not enough."
1,reliability,"Plenty of Light, but! This light came on during daylight and after 6 months started staying on during daylight. No place to even get spare parts to fix it. Stay away from this thing."
4,Essential for the costume,"This item made the costume work. I'll be using it for another costume idea. It's well made, and a good price."
1,fill in questions suck,Chpt. 8 is the worst chapter when it comes to his usual silly Fill In questions.Answers cannot be found and in Fill Ins questions the wording has to match the text !jerry sagliocca
5,auto air simplified,"Good book, about as simple as a subject like this can be made in a book. I had very little experience in air conditioning and rebuilt my system using this book. Good reference also."
5,Automotive Heating and Air Conditioning (4th Edition) (Halderman/Birch Automotive Series),"Very well written, easy to read and understand. It answers questions and gives good explanations about auto air-conditioning systems. When I last worked on cars and trucks professionally, R-12 was the norm, now R-134A is.The book helped me to convert my 1989 Ford from R-12 to the newer R-134A refrigerant."
4,"Great Laptop, wish it included Office.","I received my Toshiba Satellite M35 as a Christmas gift (thanks Louis!) and have been extremely pleased with it thus far. I'm currently attending law school, and this model has pretty much everything I might need. Except, that is, for Microsoft Office. All my papers and notes from class are on my desktop in Word, so I'll have to spend [money] to purchase the software from school. You might also want to spend [more money] and upgrade to a 2.4 mhz G wireless card, which is a good deal faster than the 802.11b card included. Not necessary though. All in all a great computer."
3,Mouse pad and front left of the computer gets heated,"If you buy this model or something closer to this model please know that it gets heated. I have Sony laptop. It is very cool. Similar heating problem was there with a Dell laptop (12.1"" screen) that I had earlier. I thought Toshiba should not have this problem. No professional review tells about this. After buying the computer only, I saw another customer in this page has already written about it. The key board also gets heated up. I don't feel very comfortable working under such a heat."
2,Definitely not a multimedia laptop,"This is not meant to be a full, all-inclusive review. These are just the points that did not meet my expectations.1. It doesn't look as good as in pictures. In fact, I think it looks ugly.2. The sound is way too soft. There is no function key to control volume. At the top volume, you can barely hear sound from movies or music.3. The 4200 rpm hard disk makes the computer sloooow when running more than one application at a time.Those were my major gripes. It actually is an OK laptop - but who buys an OK laptop when they can buy the best? The screen is nice, Intel's integrated wireless is cool, it comes with a DVD player ... everything else is pretty much what you would expect from a 15"" laptop."
2,a waste of money,"when you purchase this dvd you think hmmmmm dance hits this would be nice....wrong! many of these songs were not hits. the only songs that i liked were by adeva, soul II soul, mc hammer, and vanilla ice! i really felt that i could have spent my money on a better music dvd."
5,I like 5ive,Hi i'm kate. Basically i think the book is excellent it kept my reading for ages. Five are a wicked band and i love their music. But to make things better they are different from other bands and good looking too. I just want to say............. 5ive are the best band ever and my bedroom is coverd and my school books to in pictures of them and even lyrics.
2,Maybe I'm doing it wrong...,"but I am unable to get these to install on my 2001 Ford Taurus with DOHC. The specs say that it should fit, and the size and threading are the same as the craptacular Autolites I am trying to replace, however, they will just not thread into the grooves.The old plugs I am replacing will go back in just fine, I was really however to replace them. I'm hoping I don't have to return these."
5,"snapped a 5/16 lag bolt, "" BRUTE"" is appropriate","This is the best cordless tool I've ever owned. I've always liked the Bosch line of tools. Between the 18 volt and the 14.4 volt I ended up buying the 14.4 volt brute, and I've certainly put it to work. It has plenty of power to drive any kind of screw you want. My brother was driving in a 5/16"" X 2 1/2 lag bolt while working on my deck, we both heard a snap. My brother said, ""sorry , but I think I just broke your drill. Come to find out the drill was fine and he had snapped the lag bolt cleanly off, talk about power. The battery pack lasts plenty long enough to allow your second battery to fully charge, so you have no down time. The drill is very ergonomic, and a real pleasure to use. I dont generally leave reviews, but i must make an exception in this case"
2,A little light for daily use,"I have a cabinet shop that uses Panasonic, but since this drill came in a kit with a jigsaw and planer, we got to try it out. We specifically did not like the one hour charger, Panasonic's is much less, we like Panasonic's constant torque at any speed better, and this drill has stripped the gears after 1 year of work up against our 2+ year old Panasonics."
1,Worthless,"I ordered these to attach Christmas lights to my front porch...half of them broke with minimum pressure, and if you put 2 together to go around a pole or something, forget it...these things were worthless."
3,THE BAD PENNY,"This film was originally released under the title ""The Bad Penny."" The visual and music during the opening credits hinted that the film would be grindhouse style.Jack (Casey T. Evans) known as ""The Ripper"" owns a bar in Bangkok. He is a former boxer from St. Louis. He is visited by a fan Marcus (Nick Faltas) who is congenial in spite of the fact he lost money betting on Jack. As it turned out, Jack was supposed to take a dive in the fifth round, but that never happened. It was a ""sure thing"" as Marcus bet everything he had, including his double wide on it. Tom Arnold has an early role as a bookie.After the double cross, Jack goes on the lam to Bangkok where he is manipulated with drugs and women. The movie has some theme about choices and if we really have them. Jack makes decisions with a coin toss. The movie seemed like your average grindhouse fare. It wasn't remarkable yet at you didn't get bored.F-bombs, sex, nudity, blood, violence, killing"
1,Nobody has explained his death,"Ted Andrews had cancer for three years before dying of pneumonia. He was I think around 57 years old.Given his healing powers and knowledge, how could he die so young ?Someone has to explain more details behind his death because it tarnishes his credibility as healer to die."
3,so-so,"This is a pretty good story with a very dramatic climax, marred by the fact that the author is clueless about what tobacco sticks are used for (To hang the newly harvested leaves in the tobacco barn for curing, not for poking the stuff. Come on, for goodness sake!), and has a abysmal lack of knowledge of courtroom/trial rules of proceedure."
3,Goggles,"I thought I'd try these goggles for my job in the operating room, however they had wholes in them that could let debris in to my eyes. So I gave them to my brother who uses them on the consturction site and he hasn't had an issue"
3,OK BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I thought that this book was OK but not exactly the best book out there that you can find on Greek Magick. It does have some really excuisite information on the history of the magick practiced by the Greeks but is written in such a way that you may have to read a passage once or twice more to fully understand what the author is trying to get across. As I said before and OK book with some good information but it certainly not what I expected.
1,THE 1ST AND LAST TIME I BUY AN ITEM FROM OLD GLORY VIA AMAZON,TO START OFF ON HOW BAD THIS T SHIRT WAS IS THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE. IT HAD A HOLE NEXT TO THE PIC. THE PIC LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FADING AND WAS NIT THE COLOR OF THE ONE THAT WAS ON SPECIAL. AS YOU CAN SEE THEY HAVE TWO ADAM BOMB T SHIRTS. ONE FOR $10 AND THE OTHER ONE FOR $17.95. I ORDERED THE ONE FOR $10 CUZ IT WAS ON SALE. WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO WEARING THIS SHIRT A LOT CUZ IT BRINGS BACK CHILDHOOD MEMORIES.
5,Excellent product,"The Sezeme Snaps are great to have on hand. They are crisp & tasty, as well as remain fresh for quite a while. I've given these in treat bags for friends. All commented on how good they were. I buy these through the subscribe & save option, making them affordable snacks."
2,I love these BUT.....,"Maybe it's because of the freezing cold, or perhaps the vendor is supplying improperly handled products? These snaps are mostly broken & dry. Buyer beware, the one I bought from the local 7 Eleven were firm & tasty. These are dry and crumbly without the buttery honey sesame taste we all love."
1,Disappointed,"I bought these originally thinking they were honey and sesame. As it turns out, they are sugar and sesame. They do taste great but traditionally this type of snack should have honey instead of sugar. If you are looking for a honey and sesame snack, there are others available through Amazon that contain honey instead of sugar, among those are [Joyva Sesame Crunch Candy]. If you are looking for a sugar alternative snack that is all natural, that is your best bet."
5,Sweet and crunchy,I bought these in pursuit of a snack I used to eat when I was a kid - that version was softer and more chewy than this which has a crunch to it. 4 thin wafers/bars come in a pack and they make a great sweet snack. I keep them at my desk at work.
5,An instant addiction,I purchased a small pack of these at the gas station not too long ago and we all became instant fans. Not too sweet with just the right amount of nuttiness for a quick snack - my 12 yr old insisted I buy a full box of them!
4,there still honey in this?,"I loved eating this years ago but today I am unable to find out if the sweeting agent has changed from honey (ie good stuff) to something other than honey....""glucose, and sugar"". There are no contents written on the sides of the package of the wafers.If it has changed from honey, well it's still yummy, just not what I consider as healthy.But can I stop myself from eating them..."
1,Why did I shop in the 75 cent bargin bin?,"This CD reminds me of the time my friend forced me to see ""Grim Reaper"" in concert in the '80's. The singer farted, fell down and it took two of his band members to roll him back on his feet.I am a long time Jani Lane (Warrant) fan and a Led Zeppelin fanatic to boot. This CD should come with a warning label declaring on a scale from 1 to sucksbigtime.If I could get my money back on this crap, I would sue in a heart beat.The only thing that could have made it worse was having Jason Bonham recording again."
1,Who's bright idea was this anyway?,"If you're any kind of a Zepplin fan... DON'T buy this atrocity. This is an absolute massacre of some of rock's finest. As a matter of fact, I think that I will write my congressman!"
1,This is one of the most horrible things I've ever heard.,"First of all, let me say THANK GOD I was only subjected to the short clips from this CD via the Amazon.com web page. This is truly one of the worst things I've ever heard. Techno-Zeppelin?? Riot-Zeppelin??? Some of the tracks bear absolutely no resemblance to the original scores. I thought it was bad enough when ""Dred Zeppelin"" came out with their awful Elvis-sings-Rasta-Zeppelin music, but this remix ""tribute"" (more accurately, an insult) to one of the greatest and most enduring bands of the rock genre is simply repulsive. Please - don't buy it. In fact, write to your Congressman and DEMAND that this sort of mockery be made a federal offense...I'd hate to see the look on Robert Plant's face when he gets a load of this cover-band dementia."
1,LET CLASSICS REMAIN CLASSICS...,"When I first heard about this project...I thought of some of the other tribute CDs on the market. I'm always leary of these things, but as a fan of '80's Metal I thought it would be worth a listen...My Mistake! The guys from KIX, WARRANT, ETC. not only insult the Zeppelin fans, but their own fans as well...So Save Your Money and Remember What These Bands Used To Do!"
2,i think this is the one,"As premiere blues' interpreters it seems only fitting that Led Zeppelin's music would become source material for other artists. I enjoy the RECONSTRUCTION Remix of WONTON SONG performed by Sen Dog of Cypress Hill. He makes the song his own, and does not bother with trying to sound like ""zeppelin"". It's a good mix of rap and rock. If you are interested in Cypress Hill, and have an open mind about Zeppelin music, this CD might be interesting to you."
5,Good value,This is a sturdy and stable clarinet stand that hides inside the bell when everything is packed away.
3,Worked great for a while but then the legs started breaking,The stand was working great for my son. It fit in the bell of his clarinet and kept the clarinet from falling over. We had it for about a year and then one of the legs broke where the clarinet bell seats on the leg...I'm wondering if maybe he was pushing down on the clarinet while it was sitting on the stand. We superglued it which worked well but then another leg broke and when I superglued this one I superglued the joint and it wouldn't fold up anymore so I had to order another stand.
3,Legs break off,"This is a fantastic stand - light weight and packs in the bell - although I wouldn't do that to my bell. However, be careful and check the legs every time you set it up - they break and the stand will tip over."
2,The curators egg,"The clarinet stand is a unique design and although rather flimsy is an easy way to carry a stand. The MAJOR problem is the postage; $8 for the stand and $25 to send it... at this cost it is not worth it. I cancelled the order at the ""View Cart"" area due to cost... but that did not work and I had to pay an exorbitant price for the stand as the web page ignored my request to cancel. On immediately contacting Amazon I was told the item had already been posted... ????"
3,Comprehensive history of wood fired ovens.,"Although the book is a bit wordy, it gives the reader comprehensive history, information and instructions on how to build a wood-fired oven. The author is English and tends to refer primarily on British ovens and on baking bread. I bought the book to build an Italian style pizza oven, however the book mentions pizza only a few times. The plans on how to build a wood-fired oven are helpful and I am glad that such a book exists."
3,Not so helpful,"The book gives one set of plans without much discussion on how to modify them. I was hoping for more theory and explaination about size, height, chimney placement etc.In British fashion, the author uses more words than necessary to explain himself (think Dickens).Overall, not a complete waste of time, but less helpful than the title would lead you to believe."
2,"Interesting, but not really helpful","This is a cool book on the history behind ovens, and I enjoyed reading it. You will not be all that close to being able to build your own oven after reading this.Enjoyed reading it and understanding some history, but I should have checked it out at the library and skipped buying it.Allen Scotts book is killer, but again, you better know something about building and be creative because he gives you about 80% of the information you need. That was enough for me to complete my oven, but there was a lot of head scratching and questioning if I was doing things right. The chimney was a big miss in the book with almost no detail, so I had to fly by the seat of my pants.There is good info on the web and this was a good depiction...[...]"
2,Not worth the money...,i was hoping to find some worthwhile information on building my own brick oven... but i was disappointed... Not worth the money...
5,A Must Have!!!,"This is a must have cd and gauranteed to have you wanting more with hits like Deliverer, Comfortor, and Great and Greatly. Also Awesome God is beautiful. The whole cd is off the hook. I am really looking forward to more from this choir."
5,Rest In Peace Pastor Shawn M. Brown,"I'm am repurchasing this Album in memorial to the passing of Pastor Shawn Brown formerly of Youthful Praise. To those that don't know, if you look at the cover of the Awesome GOD CD, the colorful one, the dark skinned young man is Pastor Shawn Brown. He wrote ""Awesome God"" ""Ruler"" ""Kings to the Kingdom"" He also had an album out entitled ""Songs in the Key of David"" which featured his group ""Pastor Shawn Brown and Key of David"". CT and the Gospel music world lost a great man of GOD and an awesome and talented song writer. Gone but SURELY not forgotten..."
5,Lots of Cubicle Fun,I bought this for my friend to keep in her cubicle. It's funny and apparently provides her with a lot of entertainment...she is always sending me pictures of it.
3,Works fine but not very loud,"It works OK, but not as loud as I had hoped (I bought it to amplify the TV sound for someone who is hard of hearing)"
1,Waste of time and money,"The transmitter requires external power supply which is not included, though product description forgets to state that. I wanted to order power supply for extra money but couldn't find one. I even couldn't return it, because ANTonline didn't authorize return, but this is another story :-)"
1,If I could give zero stars I would,"The description for this product, both on the Amex website who subcontracted amazon to send these in exchange for rewards points, and on amazon is inaccurate. These headphones are meant for *specific boss hardware (car stereos)* and are not adaptable to any *other* piece of equipment. The wireless transmitter requires a power supply, not included and not availableEven the print on the product's boxes is misleading, leading one to believe the headphones compatible with video game consoles. The above review was right on the money. Buyer beware. I'm appalled that this product is listed as an amazon prime product. And unless I can figure out how to get a points reimbursement to amex, I can't even return them. Worse, I now have two sets of them."
1,Nowhere in any description did you indicate that this was for use in an automobile!!!,I was trying to find headsets that I could attach to my TV and allow me to listen privately with the sound turned down. I tried to adapt the headsets and was uncessful and in the process made the unit where I could not return them. My badYou should indicate somewhere that these are for auto use only.
1,Don't get these headphones!,"For a start, the system comes without a power source, just two wires dangling from the base station and a figure in thevery rough instruction guide indicating that a 12 volt battery should be connected there.I too some work to find the right transformer and solder it in place. Then the system ""worked"", by which I mea if the headset was placed a foot away from the base and at the correct angle, you got a good clear audio. However, trying to luse the headset 4-6 feet away from the base is a frustrating exercise, some time you get a signal, but most of the time you don't, tiny changes in the angle of the head and the headset that is on it cause the sound to disappear, and some times there is an additional buzz or humm on top of the audio (or silence).Don't be tempted by a cheap price, look for something better!"
1,Boss Audio System,I was hoping that the quality of voice will be same as wired headphones specially when it is under Boss Name. It is no where close and distortion is high.
1,Horrifying Ghost Story!,"It wasn't that it was so scary, but that it was so very poorly done! The garish Day-Glo coloring clashed drastically with the story, and most of the main characters were drawn without pupils to their eyes. Then, suddenly, the pupils would appear, then disappear! To be honest, this is NOT the DVD I thought I had ordered, but because a family member really wanted to see it, we unwrapped and watched it (for the first and last time!) The story, written by Oscar Wilde, was rather sweet, but because of the quality of the animation, I would NOT recommend ANY video from this company!"
3,"Strings, Conformal Fields and M-Theory","A pedagogical, single volume, introduction to String Theory and M-theory which includes recent developments in the fields. Kaku makes it a point to present the important ideas in the beginning of each chapter and summarize them in the end, at times being overly repetitive. The organization is clear and self-consistent -- a combination of a historical and a well-conceived hierarchical approach. While more readable than Polchinski and more up-to-date compared to Green, Shwartz and Witten, Kaku's book seems to lack the elegance and clout of these standard texts. Includes useful appendix and index."
2,why this book isn't for learning on your own,This book covers alot of material but its a waste if you don't buy other books to instruct you on formula use.
1,bait and switch charlatan,"For example: When proposing teleportation as an idea, he presents the quantum entanglement lab experiments that prove information between atoms can be transferred outside space-time faster than light speed. Then he proposes to use worm holes, which are warped space-time, instead of quantum entanglement. Sloppy. For consistency, he could have theorized the transfer of information through other dimensions."
5,Fascinating and powerful,"Someone once described sacred harp singing as singer's music rather than listener's music, which is as accurate a label as I can think of. This is like nothing you've ever heard before and it will stay with you for a long, long time."
3,Sacred Harp Singing,"I found this to sound authentic but ""muddy"". The words are hard to distinguish at times. This is how we used to sound with untrained voices and not everybody being on exact time."
3,Not a bad product,This is not a bad product to stop the draft in your chimney.Easy to setup. Significantly reduced the draft in the chimney.I do feel with some design changes this could become a really good product.
1,garbage,"Unless you have a gaping hole in your chimney or a flue that doesn't close, save your money. I bought this and read the directions assembled and installed this in under 5 minutes This is exactly what it looks like, a heavy duty plastic bag with a plastic kickstand to hold it up in your chimney.Pretty expensive for a plastic bag that you have to inflate. And what better way to ensure that customers don't return it. Once you open it you own it. So do yourself a favor and repair your chimney and don't waste you time with this item."
1,bad design - didnt work,"I am not normally a person to review and complain but I had to pipe up on this one. I read the other reviews and figured i would take my chances on this product. I wasted my money. This product supposedly will fit ""any size fireplace"" and it does not. The pad was way too big and you had to cut a slot in it for the flue bar and it looks like crap jammed in the fireplace. There is no way this will work and they offer no other rectangle size options. Thumbs down - way down."
5,Draftstopper Yes!!!,"I have read some of the reviews, perhaps if you read the directions properly yours would have worked!!! I have had mine for over 5 yrs. and it hasn't let me down yet!!! Great Invention!!!"
2,Not a very tight fit on my fireplace,"It's really hard to get a tight seal with this product. I have a 1965 contemporary with a brick fireplace. The fireplace is a bit smaller than the actual pillow and when the pillow is inflated, the pressure causes the balloon to bend in the center and at the corners, creating gaps in the seal. Inflating the pillow less helps, but creates gaps in other places. I purchased this through Home Depot, so I think I can return it. I will try a Chimney Balloon next since that product comes in different sizes."
4,Arrived as promised,"Doesn't seal as well as I had hoped, but does eliminate a lot of cold air from coming in to the house."
4,"Sturdy, easy to install, but costly and hard to tell how much energy cost it will save","I read Amazon reviews and a favorable New York Times article in late 2012 on the energy-saving value of this insulation product so I bought it. The good news is I found it made of thick gauge vinyl and it installed easily with fairly good fit around the upper inside of my fireplace. I would have rated it 5 stars but the product is costly for a big piece of vinyl and a plastic wand that probably was made in China for under $5. It's also unclear how much heat it will prevent escaping from my fireplace, but bottom line the Times said it was worth it with a reasonable payback so I bought it."
4,1 year later and going strong,Our chimney draftstopper has now been in place for about 1 year with NO ISSUES. No concerns or leaks. I have not had to reinflate it or fuss with it in any manner.
3,Leaves gaps no matter how much i adjust,"I fiddled with this this for hours. I won't even mention how it's not fun to clean your fireplace before and have soot dropped all over you during... but besides that, the finished product still has gaps. The slits in the pillow you see in the picture are for the fireplace damper handle. Ours is directly in the center, so I cut through the pillow to allow the handle through, but this prevents the pillow from touching one entire side of the fireplace where the handle attaches. Next I tried pushing the pillow above the handle, not through, and this was better but not by much. I see three gaps right now and I'm not sure how much of a difference this will make. Tough call but I say look at your damper handle, if it's attached to the side of the fireplace, DO NOT BUY THIS, it's impossible to create a seal."
5,Works Great!,"I just put this in my chimney, and I have noticed an immediate difference. I used to be able to feel a draft when I was near the fireplace, but now I feel nothing. I haven't seen a utility bill since I put it in, but I'm sure that it is going to pay for itself pretty quickly. There is really no other option besides this or something like it to block the chimney off, so I highly recommend this."
3,Minirosea4,"Can't really rate it for now, since it is not winter yet, so I don't know if it will keep the cold out, I live in upstate New York. But for now it seems to fit good and it was easy to installed."
3,Seems to do the job,Pros: the pillow is big enough to cover any opening you might have.Cons: the tube to blow it up dangles in a dirty fireplace.
1,Does not work as advertised,"I would absolutely not recommend anybody buying this product. I have installed the product as directed and the freezing air from outside is still pouring down the chimney flue and into my living room through the fireplace doors, even with the damper closed. Very expensive for what it is, not to mention it does not work. There is no way this product can seal the chimney flue completely as there will always be spaces for cold air to bypass the product and flow into your room,especially if there is any type of breeze outside forcing the air down the chimney flue. I would say the only way to really stop cold air coming down the chimney is to install a rubber lined damper on top of the chimney flue. Somebody is making a lot of money from this product that promises a lot but delivers very little!"
4,Plugged - waiting for first heating bill,Installation was very easy (read instructions first). Our first electric bill has not been received since we installed - we are hoping that this and the wood stove will reduce our bills.
1,Fireplace Chimney Draft Stop Plug Balloon,This product is not as advertised. It does not fit all chimneys. Our is very small and the balloon is very large.
5,Works great!,"We bought this item about three weeks ago and it arrived just as our state was hit with frozen, windy weather. After 1 week, it needed readjusting, but we haven't had to touch it since. There is a noticeable difference in the temperature in my family room. I have a large masonry fireplace which I pre-measured ahead of time. This plug was a perfect fit. Certainly it would not work well in anything smaller. It fit well just below my damper and I didn't have to cut a hole for the damper handle. I would highly recommend this product, just advise to measure first!"
5,Very pleased with this chimney balloon,"Let me begin by noting that, at first, I was skeptical as to the efficacy of this chimney balloon. We have a fireplace in our bedroom that both produced a cold draft and emanated much noise whenever the wind would blow. After much research (including Amazon reviews), we decided to give this product a try. We are very pleased with the results thus far. The draft has disappeared and the echo of wind through our chimney has been silenced. Installation was simple with clear instructions - took all of 5 minutes. Although our chimney is not a pure rectangle (back wall 10"" smaller than front), the balloon easily adapted upon inflation to form a secure seal. In sum, we are pleasantly surprised that this product has exceeded our expectations and are satisfied with our purchase."
2,half-descent product,"I must say i didn't expected much of this when i bought it, it was more of a chance is was willing to take.It didn't get anywere near my expectations, because it explained the good stuff in such a way, that you couldn't understand it. You would have to guess what it meant. Also, it doesn't do a very good job on separating the routes and runs from each other and they all end up looking pretty much the same.With that out of the way, the book explains the basics somehow well and some of the routes have been paying of.All-in-all an ok product.Recommended for the newbie-reciever who don't know how to make a half-descent cut, but somehow knows all the vocabulary and terms and understands the poorly explanations."
2,Wide Receivers,"The book is complete on catch drills. But in wide receivers blocking is too little. Just one chapter, and this chapter it is no extended."
1,Generic and very basic,"When I thought about purchasing this download I knew 6 pages wasn't going to be enough to provide a novel's worth of information. However, I know you can get so much more information on 6 pages than is in this article. The information is very basic and generic - like 4 vague statements summarizing what might be very good ideas.My suggestion is find another article or book."
2,an unloving translation,zola is a beautiful writer.his descriptive passages are excellent in french or english. this translation is awful nut brown hair ample bosom. it destroys a good book.
3,Proofreader Was Absent That Day,The only reason I'm reading this book is that I'm committed to the whole series. I will survive! Beware of this edition - the typos and errors will drive you crazy. They should be embarrassed to print this and Amazon should be embarrassed to sell it!
2,Not durable,"I bought this to store the kids toys which is what it is meant for. The colors are nice and bright and it looks attractive, but it is very cheaply made. The stitching came out along the top so the plastic supports stick out of the cube, not attractive and not so safe if you have little ones. I would not recommend based on the poor durablity."
2,Disappointed Customer,"I was very excited to find a light-weight, portable and foldable storage ""cube"" for my son's many toys which are otherwise strewn about his room. However, after a few days of minimal use (it was used to house stuffed animals and a few spinning tops) one of the wires that forms the structure poked out right from the fabric. This is a cute idea, but if you're planning on getting one, put it somewhere you can check it constantly and do not leave your child unatended around it."
5,Great buy!,We've had these for a couple of years now and love them! It is amazing how much stuff you can cram into them. I only wish they had them in pastels...
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"The author might be a great cook but this book is'nt worth the paper it's printed on. This book is full of MISTAKES, missing ingredients, misleading lists of ingredients. You will have to know how to cook what you're about to cook in order for it to come out right with these instructions."
4,finally a short story format that works.,"I'm generally not a fan of anthologies, I feel they usually sell the stories short and only gloss over the character and plot depth for want of space. I'm pleased to say this book didn't feel like that at all. 4 story submissions and only one didn't grab me by the heart. They were all sweet, and hot. The heros were adorable and the situations ... well, I wouldn't go so far as to say they were realistic, but I happily suspended my disbelief for 80 pages. I'd definitely recommend this for light, happy reading."
3,HOT is right . . .,"There's a lot of sweaty sheets in this one but the short story format left a lot to be desired in the form of undeveloped stories, superficial characters."
4,This book literally hit me over the head,"This book DID literally hit me over the head - in a book shop! I was browsing through the books and this novel fell off the top shelf landing on my head before it hit the floor. At the time I was more interested in the books I had under my arm so I placed it back on the shelf....but 6 months later I regretted that decision and trackedit down.I have a large interest in Avalon - I find that era particularily fascinating and this book was a great insight but more importantly it was just a great read about one womens journey and connection to Avalon. There are so few books like this around (that I can find) - I am grateful this one smacked me over the head to be noticed, lol!"
3,Not super exciting but a nice read for more insight into Steinhoff,"This book isn't your typical WWII Fighter Ace Memoir. It about the experiences of German Ace Johannes Steinhoff while he was the commander of a fighter unit in Sicily during the allied invasions. The book has a few good aerial battle descriptions, but the book is much more about the German pilots' lives and lifestyles during this dangerous time. Specifically, Steinhoff focuses on all of the difficulties that they experienced and his recognition that this was the beginning of the end for the Luftwaffe and all the chaos of the situation. At the end he looks back after 25 years and provides some additional insights. An interesting book and an easy read, but not a super exciting read."
2,"Good on no combat life, poor on combat experiences","This book details the Luftwaffe's last days over Sicily which mostly resulted in flying from primitive airfield to primitive airfield in an attempt to avoid being destroyed on the ground. It does provide some insight into the non-combat experiences of the Luftwaffe but is very short on details of combat experiences over Sicily. So if you are looking for a book that provides a pilot's perspective of personal combat then look elsewhere. If, however, you are more interested in the personal relationships of a fighter commander then this is an OK read."
2,Unreliable DVD player,"Given that this DVD player was priced at $30, I didn't expect it to impress me, but I did expect that it would work on a basic level. After initially plugging it in, the disc drawer would not open. After power cycling it a few times it did open, but would not recognize any of the discs I inserted. All were normal unscratched DVDs. After power cycling the unit a few more times it did eventually play a DVD properly, but it also demonstrated that it would never behave reliably and repeated plugging and unplugging would be the norm with this DVD player. I hope that all of Coby's entry level units are not this poor. I give it two stars only because this unit could be coaxed into operation with enough perseverance."
1,Massive frustation.,"This unit was a complete waste of my money. I set it up, it worked fine for 1 day. We watched 2 dvds on it total. After that, the player made a harsh grinding noise and quit. It is now FUBAR. It powers up, but will not load or play any discs.On a seperate note, the remote that was included with this is very difficult to operate. You need to be right in front of the player, and press the button again and again for it to respond. I tried to program my universal remote to work with it, but the company is apparently too obscure to have codes that will work with universal remotes.Please don't waste your time and cash with this DVD player. It will probaby just encourage COBY to turn out more trash like this."
1,No good,"Wouldn't play my burned ritek dvd-r 4x smoothly, kept jerking and pausing. I've returned unit."
1,DON'T BUY THIS FOR REGION FREE PLAY!,I bought this machine looking for an economical additional machine to play PAL and non region 1 DVD'S. NO SUCH LUCK! THE MACHINE DOES NOT DO THAT! It's fine otherwise but NOT FOR THE ONE REASON THAT I BOUGHT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE! FEH!
1,Wrost Ever Purchase I ever made - Junk,"Please don't even have a second thought of buying this piece of JUNK!!! This is the worst ever purchase I ever made.Unit never worked, I got an exchange from vendor second unit had ghosting problem; Unit also didn't recognize Remote Control!!Called for Warrant this time - No way to get old of Akai as there is no tech support or warranty place around in US.Learnt a lesson, I will not buy or recommend anyone to buy this junk."
4,GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE!!!,Very lightweight and great appearance. Mine has worked fine without gliches! Matter of fact.....I was so impressed I bought 2 more! Thank you for the great deal!
1,Touch and Go,"This DVD player freaks out after barely and hour of playing. Skips and gets blocky. The remote is awkward. WHEN IT ISN'T lost, you have to be 2 ft from the dvd player. And still have to point it exactly right. For this price though it gets the job done. Sometimes I have to eject and push it back in just to get it to stop skipping."
3,Colby DVD Player Review,"Product not bad for the price and even includes a small remote control. However, would not play the movie the Incredibles, but I've had the same problem with other DVD players. For a small, cheap DVD player, not bad."
4,"Not the top player, but a cheaper second system.","I have had this player about 9 months now, and it does what I ask it. It plays dvd well, and was cheap. Don't expect to get a Mercades or BMW at a Hyundi price. This player does have a little lag when it switches disc layers, and the remote is a pain at time to work, often needing to do a dance to get it to work, but again, not the worst thing in the world. It does have progressive scan. So great as a second player or for the kids, but if you want high quality, you do have to pay for it."
2,Track problems - buy the cyber home,This thing looks great - but it still has tracking problems as these cheap units tend to. Do yourself a favor and buy the cyber home - it's the only cheaper unit that seems to have some quality to it.
3,Plays PAL discs on my NTSC system,"We bought our DVD-237 last night and have watched about eight hours of video on it. The great attraction for us is its ability to play our Chinese PAL video on our NTSC television. The picture looks good and the sound, through our 2.0 system, is clear and clean.The remote is small and awkward to use. It is small (2""W x 4.5""H x 0.5"" D) and the membrane switches do not provide good tactile feedback. It is very sensitive to how it is aimed at the player. The remote is a key element because there are only minimal controls (open drawer, play/pause and stop) on the front of the unit. Basically, if there is no remote, the operation is limited to Play/Pause, Stop and open drawer. If the remote was better I would rate this player higher. Our Coby 224 has a more conventional remote that works very well with that unit.Time will tell on the reliability issue. Our other Coby player has been working well for us for about three months."
3,For Kinks Freaks Only,"I bought this DVD with an open mind.One reviewer said there was no lip-synching.The first thing I see is a badly lip-synched""You Really Got Me"" and ""All Day and All The Night"".I've seen much better live versions of these songs over the years.This whole DVD is very subdued. I was hoping for something a bit rowdier. Not enough of their early songs or better known songs overall.Some good songs are on here, but not enough to give it a higher rating."
2,Thin broth for hungry Kinks fans...,"I purchased this after reading the Amazon reviews, and hoped to see some exciting early performance film of the Kinks. This DVD is a very weak effort to cash in on the nostalgia of us fans. Also very short with forgettable performances. Listen to the excitement of their albums and save your money by ignoring this one."
1,Product details correct?,"I order this item to MOVIEMARS from this page, then they send ""The Antichrist"", Italian movie, region 4. I returned ""The Antichrist"" , but ""Antichrist"" is not arrived yet."
1,Had to turn it off it was so boring.,"If you ever stumble across the movie, and you are bored stupid within the first ten minutes. Do yourself a favor and just turn it off, it does not get any better.I'm not even sure what I was watching... I think the plot was a girl has some kind of nightmares, and her shrink is there to help her. He ends up screwing her and saying he shouldn't have done it, but I guess they ended up some kind of relationship... i dunno, i skipped scenes and gave up on it. I just could not get into the movie, it was too slow paced, boring, and I dont think it had anything to do with an anti-Christ at all. It may as well be titled, ""Snore Fest Therapy"""
2,Italian Excorcist,"This has one really interesting scene, when the character becomes possessed - the little ceremony she performs, including licking a goat's arse is strange (well, how else would you term it?). For this alone, it rated 2 stars from me.This is an Italian Excorcist rip-off. It has some interesting moments, but otherwise is really dull (unless you like seeing the woman vomiting green - but you've probably already seen that in the Excorcist).The ceremony mentioned above is done in a half-dreamlike state where the character is in bed, & has dreams/visions of being initiated in a forest, so that when in the forest, a goat-masked Satanist has sex with her, she opens her legs in bed, the bed is indented as if an invisible lover is on it with her, and she seems to feel what is going on in the forest... strange, strange, strange!"
1,"Yes, Its THAT Bad!!","After reading so many positive reviews to this awful stinker, I was compelled to set the record straight, this is a boring movie. It has nothing to offer, no scares, no special effects, only laughs and disgust. After wasting about 1 hour in a mind numbing rehash of ""what is mentally wrong with her?"" dialogue, the devil possession finally ensues and it is entirely boring. Its quite obvious that everything was outright plagerized from the superior ""Exorcist"", only proving that the Italians can not make anything resembling a decent picture in the same vein. The lead actress is weak, a cry baby and all she does is walk around like a spoiled child. The father, even worse, and I won't mention the stupid brother who has incestuous relations with his sister. In all, avoid this and don't bother like I did, expecting something worth a few scares."
4,"Not a classic, rare horror focus","Unlike most people think, this film should be seen after well knowing the religious basis which originated fear for what seems to be devil's opus. I don't scare with US-made horror films, I rather find them amusing and entertainig. This film, though, is not that much ridiculus to me, but it did not scare me, too. What is it then? It is just a horror movie not really understood. You might need to read more about religion and the Antichrist theme before going back to the movie."
2,I don't know....,"I have always heard that there were some foreign Exorcist rip-offs out there. The prospect seemed interesting. I would not expect one of these to be anywhere near as good as the real thing but figured it might be cool to see. I also happen to like Italian horror so this seemed like a good place to start. Wrong. There are some good moments and some nice camera work (which Italian horror films are known for) but the problem is that this movie moves very slowly. Now in a movie like the Exorcist you don't mind the building pace, it's worth the wait and indeed adds to the film's feel. But here I just found myself waiting and waiting for some action. Once the action starts it's then over rather quickly. If you're like me, you will be tempted to buy this movie...but really try and see it first."
3,ugly,The thing about this film is that even though Von Tries may have intentionally cast the couple as unlikeable they really are. Both to look at and by dint of personality other than the dark triggers inside them and a lack of true compassion for each other.
1,Awful Film That Gives Even The Devil A Bad Name,"There is nothing here to enjoy, just a boring story and crummy special effects.Why do people call this a classic? when it wouldn't scare or entertain even a bunch of hardened nuns."
2,MY GRADE: C.,"It's all about three people on a train who discover one of the passengers in an otherwise empty area has died. Shortly thereafter they discover his corpse has a box of diamonds on him and then gradually come around to stealing the diamonds. It had a Hitchock feel to it but man was it slow and lacking in tension. The obstacles seemed to be more along the lines of curious people getting in the way.I gave this one 20 minutes and realized why waste anymore time when I have 500 movies streamed and waiting for my approval?This movie starred two actors I really like: Danny Glover and Steve Zahn (Davis from ""Treme"" TV series). It was a direct to video piece which surprised me some but not after I saw its quality.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C to C plus; THRILLER TENSION: D; CINEMATOGRAPHY: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid July 2012 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: C."
2,"Time out, this is not a good film","Look how far Danny Glover has fallen. About the best you say about this film is that it's average cable fare for a SciFi network film (at least there are no gigantic fish or reptiles involved). But the titles are cheesy, the sets are cheesy and the acting is . . . fromage.The plot doesn't really matter, everything you wanted to know is revealed the minute the participants disclose they didn't see the same thing, you realize at that point this is a ""Needful Things"" or ""Jumanji"" type device, and the suspense is instantly gone.But even if the plot was clever, the production is so tinny you never are able to actually suspend disbelief, no more than you would watching a play put on by your local PTA. All that was put aside the first few seconds of the film, when the initial title hammers it home that this is straight to video. Who thought that title design conveyed respectability? And what's with the price? Laughable."
2,Not as bad as I thought,"Even though this is just a so so film, which first scene makes you wonder if it wouldn't be better to stop watching it at once, and do anything else instead; its plot gets sort of interesting some minutes later, and doesn't bore you as much as you thought it was going to.Nevertheless, Leelee Sobieski shows what a fine actress as much as and attractive woman she is."
1,We Have All Been Here Before,"The basic plot line is a direct lift of Shallow Grave, a better acted and directed film. Do yourself a favor if you're tempted by this and see Shallow Grave instead."
4,Great Hitchcock style low budget piece!,"This film is a perfect example of how to make a very effective and suspenseful film with a low budget. One location, few actors and great script. The interaction between the different characters is great. Danny Glover is perfect as the aging train conductor who sees the chance to get a break in life. Only thing that disturbed me was the bad CGI."
4,Good Product,"I had no problem installing this mirror and it works great for me to keep an eye on my baby when driving. The light show and music are nice but the music is too low even at the highest setting which makes ita problem when it get noisy on the road, other than that its a good product and it attaches safely to the head rest."
2,Not so magical,"This mirror really isn't worth the money. You'd be better off just buying a plain mirror for baby to look in and for you to look at baby, that's about all this thing does. The remote control has to be pointed directly at the mirror, kinda hard to do driving down the road. Also, the music isn't very loud, atleast not loud enough to get baby's attention when upset, which is what I was hoping for. And the lights aren't very bright. Really can't see that they even light up unless it's very dark out. Also, the positioner works fairly well when baby is facing backwards, but once you turn baby around and have to attach the mirror to the back of the front seat, it doesn't stay in place that well. You could spend alot less money for just a plain baby -in-sight mirror."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED BY CHP!!,"I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked, and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile, possibly injuring or killing your child. DO NOT BUY!!"
5,Everyday Elegance,"This lovely Vieux Luxembourg tea (cup and companion) saucer speaks of delicate blue floral on creamy white that remind of Nordic décor and lends everyday elegance for my herbal teas, hot cocoas, sipping chocolates and any combination thereof. From microwave to table to dishwasher, this vitrified porcelain has been making the rounds for many months since arriving, with no hint of tiring whatsoever. The quality is top notch and the light-weight feel in the hand is pleasing to the senses. I couldn't be happier with this delightful line as my luxurious daily ware. Villeroy and Boch products have earned the generally rare distinction of frequently bringing a feeling of richness to my many calming moments with a beautiful cup of something hot or warm and delicious (or even just simply healthy in the way of warm milky drinks). Thanks again to Amazon for another affordably extraordinary treat brought right to my door!"
3,"Good recording, but rather unclimatic music per se.","If you're used to listening to Mozart, you wouldn't be surprised when I tell you that this is one of his less dazzling works. (As compared to Requiem, etc.) The music on this cd is a very good recording, but the music never goes to the same places that some of his other works do. Compared to Tchaikovsky, this is much less fantastical, but much less regimentalized than Beethoven. It's some good middle-of-the-road classical music worthy for the collector, but not for someone looking for widely recognizable classical."
4,Just As The Reviewers Say...,"I'm not a very good reviewer...so I'll just say I agree with the pros.""Blistering, inspired roadhouse blues and passionate Southern rock... supercharged guitar and gritty, soulful vocals."" -Relix""Atlanta's Tinsley Ellis sings like a man possessed and wields a ferocious lead guitar...one of today's premier blues/rock players."" -Billboard""Ellis unleashes a torrent of dazzling musicianship....""Highly recommended for any aficionado of blues rock."
2,Not as good as others,"This one is not as good as the others in the ""It's Not My..."" series. Only the last page has a decent, large section of fur to touch. The other pages are filled with areas too small, like the nose or the paws or a bell around the neck."
3,not as good as other that's not my...books,"Not as good as that's not my princess or dragon or puppy...the touch and feel stuff just isn't as interesting, the bumpy paws are sandpapery, but my daughter is bored with the smooth tongue that's just lamination and the shiny bell, the other books are so much more tactile and have so much more interesting things to feel. I am going to get that's not my princess instead, she loves that one."
5,Dakota Skye,DVD Dakota SkyeNick & Norah's Infinite PlaylistJuno (Single-Disc Edition)This is a delightful and thoughtful movie that was created by a team of first time film makers. The story is engaging and one most of us can relate to. The director's skill is subtle but apparent as he leads the viewer through a defining event in the life of a disillusioned teen girl. The performances of the actors are natural and convincing. I had seen Dakota Skye at a film festival along with hundreds of enthusiastic movie fans. I was disappointed that it did not play in local theaters but thrilled at its DVD release.
3,Someone get Dakota a coffee...,"Jonah,with a killer smile and personality, falls IN LOVE with (Whinnie the Pooh's friend) Eeyore??!! Yeah right. I was waiting the entire movie for Dakota to wake up and say something witty or insightful, or even bust out a smile. I did watch the entire movie, and I gave it 3 stars because I liked Jonah and some of the soundtrack. Even in the end I found it hard to believe that Jonah was still single when she popped up a year later. AND if Arizona is so dang HOT, like she noted numerous times, then ditch the army coat and heavy bedtime gear. ugh."
1,Fantasy Chick Flick for Chicks LIving in Fantasy,A chick flick fantasy movie derived from all the chick flick fantasy TV shows that have ever existed and fabricated for escapism from the boring realities that eventually hit home when disappointment after disappointment showcases that your life is not following the same script that the film fantasy opiates have induced.
5,God I want her abilities.,"I was watching movies on my netflix and this came up. I thought the premise was nice enough to see and I'm glad I watched it. I can't really pinpoint what it is that I liked exactly, but it was intriguing. I liked the title character and felt for her throughout the movie. I wouldn't mind to have her abilities. Although I can see why it is a burden. I added it to my must have DVD's and got it for Christmas. Great Gift for any."
5,Great Independent Film,"I stumbled upon this film on cable, and was pleasantly surprised at its quality. I was further surprised to find out it was a low-budget film. High recommended."
1,Bop-a-lots DVD,My little boy shows ZERO interest in this DVD! He perfers his Sesame Beginnings collection.
5,Love it.,WE HAVE TEN GRANDCHILDREN AND WE HAVE PURCHASED NUMBEROUS EDUCATIONAL DVDS FOR EACH OF THEM. WE THINK THIS DVD IS EXCEPTIONAL. IT EXPOSES THE CHILDREN TO THE INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR OF MUSIC. THE CHARACTERS ARE SO LOVELY AND ATTRACTIVE TO THE CHILDREN. WE BROUGHT SEVERAL AS GIFTS TO OUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
4,A change from Baby Einstien,"If your kids love Baby Einstien but you are tired of the classical music, you will like this DVD. Four familiar songs all put to different music. My girls liked it and I liked the change. You can preview the DVD on their web site(I put my girls on my lap to see their reaction before I bought it). AND I got the DVD two days after I ordered it."
3,Pleasant and positive,"A very brief note to comment that this is a pleasant movie with a positive social message, suitable for most children over 8 or so. It looked as though it was dubbed, but I could find no reference to this on the box."
2,I'll use my sound clip option...more often,"After ordering General's Daughter (love the CD) this title was listed as one that I my like. I knew that the songs would not have the heavy mix as those in General's Daughter. These songs are ""FIELD"" recordings. Again I blame myself for not researching a little deeper."
4,It's All In The Title,"The title says it all, eh? Shakespeare in the original Klingon. However, to those who go there, it's really neat. I would have given it 5 stars, but there were not as many notes as there should have been. And more background on the Klingon origins of the piece would have helped. Other than that, majQa!"
1,Rip Off,"&#65279;This book is a rip off. It's basically an extra large print 94 page infomercial for whoever ponies up to the publisher. Here's the gimmick. The author goes on and on about the dangers of indoor pollution and all the harm it can cause and states along with anonymous testimonials that the author has found the solution. The number to call to order the ""solution"" which is an un-named air purifier can be found on the last page of the book. No where does the name of the air purifier manufacturer appear in the body of the book. In fact it didn't appear on the last page of my book either where the words ""your sticker here"" appeared. Apparently, manufacturers are to pay for the right to have their product's name appear on a sticker placed on the last page. I guess no one paid for the right for the book I bought. This book should not be sold by Amazon."
1,piece junk,"Ok here is why to stay away from this company. Work for a utility company so wife bought the 24v version for me as a fathers day gift. Had it a whole week and the lock ring assembly blew apart while in a customers home. Took it back to Menards and they had to saw my bit off the drill. They replaced it and a month later the exact same thing happened to the replacement. So Bosch offering an ""old drill"" trade in on their site a while back. I email them to ask if they trade up their own junk explaining what happened with the other ones. No reply no ""were sorry you paid $180 for our junk sure send it in"" yeah right just no reply at all. I will never buy another tool with their name on it. Some may ask did I buy the right strength drill. My answer: it was supposed to be the industrial grade model. The only thing good is their fast battery charger. However what is a good battery worth without the drill working and in one piece."
2,"Not brute tough, not even wife tough!!","I have owned this drill for less than a year in a home use setting. My wife was using it to hang pictures in a plaster wall when it ""stripped out"", i. e. the motor was turning but not the chuck. I purchased this drill because it sounded like the components were not likely to fail in a light duty application. Oh well..."
2,"ok but,","its ok, but i was looking for something more powerful. Still cant drill through my thick garage wall. Rachel said that i was doing it wrong. but when she tried, it got stopped right away. Shows how much girls know! Still seeking for more power. Any suggestions?"
5,Don't know what you meant by title in this case,Nothing more to say. All those additions discourage me from participating in your reviews.Don't have time for that silly stuff.
5,Lo Que Llevo Por Dentro,"This CD has great energy and passion. By the end of the second song I often find myself shouting things like : ""sing it Frankie!!"" What a great talent this man is!"
5,"Inspiring movie about a Dr. who has to deal with his world, but as a patient.","This is a great movie about how a person can change due to their circumstances and the influence of others in their lives. I watched this twice and I may even buy a copy of it to keep. Basically life gives a cocky Dr. a shocking experience of becoming a patient, where nobody cares that he's a Doctor. It drags in places, but stay with it, it will be worth it for you."
3,"Great Movie, interrutpted streaming",Movie is a great look into the evolution of a physician in his transition from doctor to patient. I wish the streaming was uninterrupted... but we had a few breaks... like a skipping DVD?
1,Eghh,I got this to find out it wont even play in my dvd player its not a playable movie when I asked what was wrong with this... I'm not sure what I'm suppose to do with this movie then...
4,Excellent Movie,"I teach potential nursing students and ask that they all watch this movie as part of the medical ethics portion of our class.It is a very feel good movie, has humor and teaches basic moral ethics.I love it."
4,I Actually Give a 4.5 Star,"A doctor experiences a shift of his role from an arrogant doctor to a helpless patient due to his unexpected illness, and his psychology is expressed very well in the form of movie.The view expressed in this film is a serious problem in the United States as medical practice is run as a business not as an act of helping humans. A drastic change must be made in order to improve the medical community, and the current situation is far from ideal.I cerebrate the courage for this movie to impose the idea and hope it had helped to some extent to improve the medical system."
1,I don't read descriptions very well.,"I have no idea how this movie is. It's a VCR, not a DVD. It's very inconvenient for me to return items. Thank you for this opportunity to say that it shout be in caps: VCR not DVD."
3,The Doctor,This movie was ok. The book was way better! I would recommend this movie to anyone in the medical field. It changes your prospective on Doctors and Nurses.
5,A hard reality in life......,"Being in the medical profession myself for over two decades, I can relate closely to the theme of this movie. It is well written, humorous but also a cold, hard reality of life (cancer) that nobody wants to face. It gives the viewer a sense of mortality and reality if and when it is their turn; should it happen. Also how to view others who are fighting this dreaded disease and a glimpse of their inner fears and thoughts. I highly recommend the film....."
5,Excellent Movie,One that I have enjoyed over and over. A must see for anyone in the medical profession.
1,It never played& threw away pkg .,Won't play on my DVD player.evedently defective . Not savy enough to figure out how to get another one without all the rigor Moro.
3,Not a big fan...,"I bought this CPR video to use for my high school health classes. It is a very thorough overview of CPR, Heimlich Manuever, AED, and some first aid basics! However, my students thought it was very boring and repetitive (and I agreed). The other downfall is there is no menu button to be able to choose particular scenes."
3,ok,This book is not too easy or hard for me.I understand what they are reading about. It has good questions.
4,Star Wars EU goodness,"Nobody does Star Wars like Zahn - this was a very nice installment, taking a trip back to just after the original Star Wars movie, later retitled Episode 4, A new Hope.All the base characters from that era are there in limited form, as well as some early era Mara Jade, and a group of dissatisfied Storm Troopers.If you like Star Wars, READ IT!"
5,Epic!,"Now, I love this book. It kept me energetic and amazed the whole way through. I highly recommend this book to any Star Wars fan big or small. I have even purchased this book in paperback for most of my friends."
2,"Boring, predictable, but it wasnt terrible.",I've read a lot of SW EU novels... and they are never very good. Which is why I stopped reading them... this one was alright... not very memorable... pretty predictable...
2,Huge Disappointment!!!,"Timothy Zahn is my favorite author, but this story really never seems to get going. It's fun to see Mara Jade as a young Emporer's Hand, but too little time is spent with our other heroes. The real stars of the book are a group of rouge storm troopers and they just aren't that interesting. The plot is a little too conviluted also. Mr. Zahn can do much better. If you want Zahn, check out ""Night Train To Rigel"" instead."
4,"Average Star Wars book, by Timothy Zahn standards.","I've read most Star Wars novels and Zahn has always been my favorite author. There's always a feeling of reading a genuine Star Wars episode, with classic and new interesting characters and events that will irremediably affect the Star Wars saga, for the better. This book is a good and entertaining book but feels more like a side story than a true Zahn epic."
3,Just Average Star Wars Book,"If you are a Timothy Zahn fan then you are going to be disappointed with this book. If you aren't then you are going to think it's just an average Star Wars book. I'm in the latter group. I don't think Timothy Zahn is that great of a Star Wars writer because I get into characters, their development and the politics of the world. Mr. Zahn is more into the action. This book has action but no focus. There are about 4 or 5 different storylines that are all over the place. I enjoyed the Mara Jade one but the rest were convuluted and almost unnecessary. I loved the Darth Vader makes a short appearance to throw his weight around some. However, I just found the character development lacking and I didn't really care about any of the new characters and the older characters weren't used in a way to further anything. I would recommend this book only to serious Star Wars readers to continue the series or to Timothy Zahn fans that won't believe me. ;-)"
3,"Good story, but not great.","This is my first experience reading a Timothy Zahn novel. Though I enjoyed the story line and how it intertwined with the classic trilogy characters, I wasn't drawn in by the writing. The author's style of describing action sequences was somewhat vapid, lacking zest. I have read other EU books that were more exciting to read, so much so that I just couldn't put it down (like ""Path of Destruction"" or ""Betrayal""). But like I said, it's not a bad book at all, only the writing left me wanting."
2,A weak return from the Master,"Timothy Zahn's eighth book in the Star Wars expanded universe and, unfortunately, possibly his weakest yet.The story itself reads as though it were written for a very specific group of fans, and is at oft times childish. For the more adult die hard fans of Star Wars the continuity changes will draw frowns, with characters from previous books acting with greater skill than they appear to have later on in life.Though, for these difficulties the simplicity of the story, and the ease of the writing will appeal to younger fans, and those looking for a simple and quick read with nothing challenging. Though these are not the trademarks of the intrigue and atmosphere that Timothy Zahn's other work has.Not great, stormtrooper fans especially will love the Hand of Judgment and this story, so if you are; consider it recommended. But certainly this is not close to his best work, and it simply doesn't feel like it was written for the wider audience."
1,This book is not what it is advertised.,"I frankly feel ripped off by this book. This book is NOT about Luke, Leia, Han, and Vader. I doubt they get a tenth of the pages. Zahn truly believes his characters are better and more interesting than Lucas's. Hence mostly Mara, and we're drowning in the stormtroopers I care nothing about.I wanted what was promoted: the story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Vader between A New Hope & ESB. I wanted to know how Vader feels about finding out he has son - nope. I wanted to know how Luke feels about the death of his aunt and uncle, learning about the Force, becoming a hero - nothing. How does Leia feel about the death of her world? - nothing.This book isn't really about Star Wars or Star Wars characters. It's just set there to sell books. This about Zahn and his characters, not about the characters George Lucas created thirty years ago - and I still care about. I feel cheated."
5,The Good Old Days,"Tim Zahn does it again. Another great Star Wars novel. A young Luke, Leia, and Han. A young Mara Jade, rogue Storm Troopers and it's good to see Chewie, Vader, and Emperor Palpatine alive and kicking again.Buy this book."
2,Not Zahn's Best ... Another Forgettable Star Wars Novel,"Zahn is definitely one of the best Star Wars authors out there. (He delivered the only readable prequel-ere novel in Outbound Flight.) With him behind the story, I was hoping for a good classic-trilogy-era novel showing Luke struggling to be a jedi without a teacher and Han and Chewie being the rogues of old. Unfortunately, there is too little of our favorite characters. Most of the book follows a group of weak-minded stormtroopers, whose simple logic and motivation grew tiresome quickly. The few shining moments in Allegiance, in my opinion, were the interactions between Mara Jade and Darth Vader. If we're going to get any more of the young Mara during the Rebellion, I hope to see more on the tense relationship between her and Vader."
2,Not Zahn's best work,"I had trouble staying engaged, and in fact put the book down for a few weeks after which I had lost major parts of the plot.The 4 stormtroopers besides LaRone kind of blended together without any discerning personality traits, and the Luke/Han/Leia subplot seemed bolted on just to give the fans a taste of the main characters.Overall it was okay and it was interesting to get a glimpse of the story between ANH and ESB, but I'd say it's Zahn's worst novel to date."
5,A must-read,"Empathetic. Enlightening. A must-read for anyone seriously (and, ahem, ITELLIGENTLY) interested in the topic of MPD."
2,Well.....,"It felt more like a story than a truth. Very little focus on MPD a lot more focus on a needy self. I enjoyed the entertainment factor of this story, but the educational factor wasn't all there"
1,No She Doesn't...,"... unless she's talking about impersonating Florence Foster Jenkins, that is. One can only imagine the trouble the studio engineers had keeping a straight face while this travesty was recorded."
2,"It isn't so bad, but it just isn't good enough","There is nothing particularly bad, but there is not enough good stuff.If you're completely new to SQL, this doesn't give you good SQL basics. If you already know some similar SQL server (Oracle, MS SQL, IBM DB2 etc.) you will skip 2/3 of the book because you will already know that. If you already know a little about SQL and want to learn MySQL, you're good candidate. But bear in mind this book is quite agy today, some examples and menitoned tools are obsolete and quite serious part of the book is ""reference documentation"" that you can find on the internet (in much nicer and bigger version)."
2,Disappointed,"Not as thorough, clear, or helpful as I had hoped. I would not recommend this book unless it was given freely."
5,A Masterpiece!,"Ever since a friend of mine bought this CD at some discount store, I've been hunting it down through all the possible resources. It is truly amazing, no matter what your personal music tastes are like. Do yourself a favor and get this!"
1,No Good,"When turning the power off via accessories from the ignition, this preamp make a loud repititive thump.This noise is becoming a nuisance.This unit does not gives out ouptput of 7 volts as claimed by the specs.I installed another brand preamp and the problem did not occur.Upon re installation of the Boss Preamp, the problem persists.I will not recommend this product to any one. It is the first time that I have purchased a product through Amazon that I am not pleased with."
1,No support,"I purchased this pantograph and discovered it was missing an important part. I went to the Vermont American web site where they boast of lifetime guarantees and replacement of missing or damaged parts. It turns out Vermont American is now owned by Bosch. I called Bosch tech service and they told me there are no parts or replacements for this item and there was nothing they could do for me. Vermont American lifetime guarantees are out the window. The seller said it was a clearance item and they want nothing to do with my problem. I now have a useless piece of junk unless I can figure out how to fabricate the missing part. Buyer beware. If you have a problem, you're on your own. Buy a Milescraft pantograph where you will get support."
3,timothythetoolman,The pantograph is a light duty unit. I wish is was a little stronger. I have used it on a few projects and it preformed just fine.
1,Those Who Say It's The Worst Movie Ever...,"...haven't seen Moment By Moment with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin, but it's close.Pros - It was free - My dog also watched it and didn't bite me.Cons - It was hard to appreciate since I'm not in Junior High anymore"
1,BORING,This was a very boring terribly bad quality movie. Don't waste your time with this piece of low quality junk.
2,it's ok,so i had this free on prime.. it's OK to watch. nothing special here... but if you have time watch it.
1,Careful..Unsensored,"Lots of nudity. I did not expect the video to be unsensored. Make sure kids are in bed before watching and furthermore, if you are offended by nudity Do Not Watch!!! Very disapointed."
1,Dumb and Dumber,"I can see why this show went off the air. Many of the tapes were so blurry they looked like snowstorms or the subjects were difficult to see. The subject matter (people urinating on other people's property or even in their victim's food) were, pardon the pun, tasteless. This show might appeal to a 5th grader but there was too much of the R rated content to make this show appropriate for a young audience.A clear ""2 thumbs down"" or 1 star rating. The show rates 1 star for the few but far between amusing pet clip."
2,Caught on tape,"Porn. There was a little bit of information and a lot of porn. Definitely rated R. I was in the same room as my younger brother,but I was on my lap top. I am so glad he was not looking over my shoulder as he often does. I was not even able to finish the episode because of this."
1,the amazon download needs to be updated,I spent a long time downloading so I could wathc on a plane--the film came through like a negative and was unwatchable. I think Amamzon needs to get software to let customers know if they have the compatable program to play the film-- I was afraid to buy anything becasue I don't know if it will play on my new netbook.
4,Old Classic That is a collector's item.,I have the current copy of this collector's item on sale. It is a newer release and the copy is bright and as clear as it can be for the era when it was released. I have found this version of the classic novel to be a better story than the two or three versions that followed it.
2,usb cable,"when i unplugged it from my phone, that little piece that hooks in the phone broke and i can't pull it out. but it worked out fine cuz i don't use my headset so i just left that piece there and it still works."
2,"Contrary to its name RIPSTOP sling, it does rip","I registered for this diaper bag because it wasn't huge and it was a neutral color. I did not want a bag with Pooh bear or any other characters on it. Although it is on the small side it served its purpose well until it started falling apart. The lining on the inside ripped and would get stuck in the zipper everytime you zipped the bag closed. The strap was also starting to tear away from the bag. I only used this bag for about 4 months before returning it for something else. The manager at Babies R Us let me exchange it but said normally they wouldn't because normal wear and tear is not covered. I was not overly rough on this bag and I thought something made by Eddie Bauer might be a little more durable then what it was. So beware of this bag, it may not be worth the trouble."
1,BAG IS TORN EVERYWHERE WITH NORMAL USE,THIS BAG RIPPED IN THE INSIDE AND THE SEAMS OF THE OUTSIDE POCKET FLAPS. I DID ORIGIANLLY LOVE THIS BAG THE FIRST 2 MONTHS BUT AFTER THAT IT STARTED UNSTITCHING AND NOW I HAVE TO GO GET A NEW BAG BECASUE IT IS EMBARASSING TO WALK AROUND WITH IT NOW... BUYER BEWARE.
2,"Nice concept, poor execution","I chose this bag because it doesn't scream ""diaper bag,"" the material doesn't attract dirt and the two front pockets make keys and cards easily accessible. I thought wearing the cell phone case right on your chest was a nifty idea, too.That said, I hate this bag!!! For starters, it is cumbersome. It's big for no reason, because nothing seems to fit in there! Everytime the bag is set down, the cell phone case goes upside down and the phone falls out. It's not made for a petite person...even though the strap is adjustable, it still was too low. I can't comment on the durability of this bag because I returned it right away and bought a Skip Hop instead. Now THERE'S a diaper bag!"
2,Not satisfied,"I am a first time mom and registered for this diaper bag. I wanted something I could carry easy. It is very easy to carry, however my daughter is less than 6 months and it is already ripping and falling apart. It also not very big and I had trouble fitting all the items I needed to pack inside. I ended up buying a back-pack from Pottery Barn that I absolutely LOVE!I definately do not recommend this item."
2,Not enough room and poor construction,"I love the style of this bag but I hate the bag itself. It doesn't have enough room for half of what we need to take with us. We are only able to use it for short trips where all we'll need is a diaper, wipes, a sippy and a small toy...anything other than that and we have to take a bigger bag. Plus the innner lining of it pulled loose the second week we had it. This bag maybe be stylish but it's not at practical."
2,Bag okay,"This bag is very stylish but not practical. I liked the fact it has a place for credit cards and other parental items, but there's not a lot of room inside for diapers and other essentials. This bag might be perfect for people with children no longer wearing diapers but with a six month old it's just not laid out very well."
2,Very POORLY Designed!!,"I bought this bag because it looks great and seemed very comfortable. However, when I got it home and tried to pack it for my newborn I realized it just wouldn't work. The design is not well thought out at all...the bottle holders on the inside make it hard to organize and fit much of anything without having to stuff it all inside. And my baby's items are still VERY small! Also, I don't know about other bags but the changing pad on this one seems very narrow and short...again okay for a tiny infant but would not be useful for an older baby."
2,Not as good as anticipated,"I bought this bag because I like sling style bags. It appeared to have adequate space inside and out. However, it doesn't hold as much as I'd like it to and the items placed inside are not easy to access. Also, the inside lining is tearing away from the bag and I've only been using it for about 5 weeks. I'm very diappointed in this diaper bag."
1,Not Happy,"I just had my second child and have been through lots of different diapers bags over the years. I was looking for something that would hold the items I needed for my baby, but also a place for my stuff. I thought this would be a great bag. I thought it was, until about one month later when the inside lining came completely apart . This diaper bag is not made well. I never thought it would fall apart after only one month."
1,Disappointed,"I received the Eddie Bauer backpack and the small diaper bag from our baby shower registry which are great. So I decided to get this one thinking its durable just like my other bags. I love the way it looks but I only had it for 3 months and the lining tore. I tried fixing it but the lining fabric is very cheap it just was getting worst. Very big disappointment. Even though its a very pretty bag, I wouldn't recommend this bag to no one. It's not worth the money."
2,"I LOVED this bag, until now!","I have the Eddie Bauer backpack and used that when my son was a month or two old, but soon grew tired of fussing with getting items out of it while holding a baby.So I looked for an easier access bag and found this Eddie Bauer one.I loved this bag because I just had to sling it over my shoulder and could easily access the contents of the bag while holding my son.I've had this bag since the summer and its now a piece of junk. The inside lining is torn and the actual strap is tearing off of the back of the bag (where its attached).Plus, this bag doesn't hold much and is much smaller than it appears to be.It was an excellent bag until it began to fall apart.I'd recommend looking for a different bag."
2,Like the idea but....,"Love the sling design. I also have your standard over-the-shoulder style and it is ALWAYS falling off my shoulder. And the sling design doesn't scream diaper bag which Daddy appreciates. So I am sticking with the sling/messenger bag style.However, the lining is ripped to shreds just from normal use after less than 6 months. So I am looking for another one. I did use it everyday, but I expected it to take a whole lot more before it started falling apart. Disappointed and would not purchase again."
3,"not a bad bag, but...","the inside lining ripped only after a few months of use. I really liked the bag at first until this happened. It is stylish and holds enough for a short trip out, and is easy to carry."
1,"Rips easily, even the replacement came w/ rips!","We received this item as part of our baby registry. Within a few weeks, it begin to rip (the lining inside). Baby Boom (the manufacturer) agreed to send a new one. After a couple of mail attempts we finally received it (SEVERAL weeks later). The first day of use, the lining already started to rip. Did I mention the inside zipper came broken as well? When we called about the 1st bag, they said if the replacement also had flaws, they would upgrade our bag. We haven't called yet, so we'll see.In addition to the above flaws mentioned, it is extremly small. It looks large in the store, but when you start putting basic baby items in it, it fills up fast. It doesn't open very wide.I don't recommend the bag at all. More hassle than it is worth. As far as the manufacturer goes...even though we got a new bag, they were slow in returning messages and in delivery. In general, I suggest staying away from Eddie Bauer bags."
2,Much smaller than it appears!,"This diaper bag looks great and is very comfortable to carry. However, it doesn't hold as much as I would like it to. Once you start to put stuff in all of the little compartments, the big compartment is suddenly very small! So, you either have to put everything in the big compartment, or just try to squeeze it all in while using the small ones. I've only used this bag a few times because I just don't care for it, so I can't comment on it getting ripped, as others have mentioned. I have ended up using a nice homemade diaper bag that my purse-making aunt created. It appears smaller than this bag, but actually holds a lot more!"
1,Poor construction - Great Style,"I have had this bag for a few months. I love the style and size. I thought this was the perfect bag for me, until it started ripping everywhere. The zipper just broke too! DO NOT buy this bag - it will never hold up to daily use. Babies R Us will not refund/exchange as it is past 90 days, and Eddie Bauer states that it is a licensed product and therefore can not provide anything either."
4,"great purse, good diaperbag","I saw this bag and thought it looked great. It has a cell phone pocket on the strap which is easy to grab. Its a great size. not a huge bulky diaper bag, but large enough for me to fit my sons things as well as a few crucial things from my purse. we shared it. I loved it.The only problem I have with this bag is, at the corner of the bag, where the strap is sewn into it, it started to rip. I now have a hole in the corner of my bag."
4,I love this bag!!,"This is a really great diaper bag!!! I got it for my husband because of the more masculine look, and I like it better than mine!!! It keeps bottles cold for a long time! We've never had one get warm on us! Also, the pockets are great, and I love that they are on the outside, because they are very accessible. The changing pad included did get a smallish rip at the seam not long after we got it, but it isn't ruined and we still use it a lot. Also, I wish it had a little more room, but my husband thinks it has plenty. Overall, I am very glad that we purchased this bag. It is great."
5,Excellent book of OB/GYN. The chapters are short and concise!,"I just finished my gynecology course and I pretty much didn't have to go anywhere else to look for further information. I aced my class. I love this book and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in learning the basics of Ob/Gyn. The chapters are very easy to read and it's especially designed for us Medical Students(not residents) who have little to study a specific subject, because they are short but have everything YOU as a Medical Student have to know.I wish I had found it earlier when I took my Obstetrics course.Buy it with confidence, you won't regret it."
5,loveable huggable,i have one for my daughter and is it just the right size to cuddle with and snuggle up to. she takes it everywhere. i would recommend to anyone who has littles who love woobies ( that's what she calls it). It's perfect for those little arms to wrap around.
5,:),"Glad to find a lovey for my child that wasn't pink or blue. The bear's head was a little smaller than I expected, but still good."
2,Very Disappointed...Defective Stitching on 3 Huggacubs,I was very disappointed with the quality of the stitching on the faces of these Huggacubs. I kept sending them back and each replacement had the same issue...the stitching on the bear's nose did not completely cover the nose and was very obvious. I ended up sending all three back. I believe that Amazon must have received a defective batch of these bears.
1,not happy,product is stitched horribly ... and threads are coming out .... looks much better in the pics than in reality
4,Molly Bang is amazingly in touch with southern magical mojo,"The only reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because the quality of the illustration reproduction could be higher (the illustrations being excellent in themselves). If you have ever lived in the deep south, you may have experienced some feeling of magic in the air, some feeling of ancient strength or knowledge that is just beyond the bayou. Molly Bang has tapped into this with a powerful mythical story of survival within the mojo filled natural world. (similar in flavor to the Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher). She has also told the tale of a very strong woman and child who overcome a force (the Hairy Man) who threatens them. We have two children, age 2.5 and 9 who both enjoy this story."
3,"Not His Best Work, But Good","The basic premise here is that there is a group of people out there who do not think like the rest of us, and they are women. If you can get past that and like Van Vogt, you'll probably like this book. Van Vogt has a style of writing that certainly pulls one in and makes a good read. If only SF in TV and movies matched his level. I found this work to be quite an enjoyable read."
1,Did not help at all!,"Bought ring-ex & clenzor for my pet dog. After applying for more than 2 weeks, there was no visible improvement. In fact the affected area got bigger and more hairs loss."
2,Nothing special.,"This book is ok at best. The large majority of the advice is broad tax advice that applies to all tax filers, not just Police/Fire/EMT. There was only a handful of references to first-responder specific items and unfortunately, even those items weren't that helpful."
1,so so,I wouldn't recommend this book. If you go to the IRS website you can get the same information. The book was repetitive in parts and I just didn't learn anything other than the deductions I already knew were allowed.
2,Hard to read and even harder to understand.,"The sentences in this book are disjointed, as though the author was writing down random thoughts. I found this very disconcerting and it made the book difficult to understand, even though the author writes in layman's terms. There are some pages towards the end of the book where the author gets lost in thanking his peers, and this throws the book off kilter as well. His coping mechanisms are not very helpful either, since most of us cannot be world travelers or sing in nightclubs when we are depressed, but there are a few good pointers. The difficulty lies in selecting the pointers out of the jumble of words. I got the feeling the author needed to write for his own sake, and was not targeting any audience. As a result, we have a journal of random thoughts and a cocktail of suggestions here and there. I got a few good tips from the book, however, and so I cannot count it as a total loss."
5,Cute and Functional,I purchased 2 the med. siz and large size..Great when to use both when vacationing..Straps could have been made better but really no problems even with straps..I love the loud pink look!! Lots of compartments and and have had used over 7 months with little show of wear..Cleans easy with soap and water..
5,I was impressed on how the man was involved.,"I am a 32 year young librian, who plans to have children in my mid -late thirites.This book will help me prepare for my child at that time. New Natural Pregnancy seems so peaceful and makes being pregnant look so simple. At first I was afraid to have children but after reading this book, I feel more at ease."
4,So far so good...,"I just downloded the track ""American Tune"" by Gretchen Peters, from I-Tunes. Although Paul Simon wrote the original, I think Gretchen Peters did it better. I rarely like covers of songs and very few ever come close to the original, but she knocked this one out of the park. She opens the track by saying she thought about this song after 9/11, and I always wonderd why Paul Simon didn't perform it right after 9/11-instead performing ""The Boxer""on SNL. I always felt that was the wrong choice. Anyway, a truly beautiful remake. I look forward to hearing the rest of this album and giving another star."
1,"smelly, noisy waste of money - avoid this product","This product is a waste of money. It doesn't work.It's noisyIt's smellyIt doesn't collect enough urine clumps, but breaks it up into small chunks that never get scooped up, but just continues to smell up your house.The rotating tray is too small and doesn't prevent the cat from flinging litter everywhere.In the month I used it, I cleaned up the mess and went through more litter than my manual box.I can't stress enough DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT"
1,junk junk junk,"i bought this product through amazon in december and it broke the first week of march. i have NEVER, in all the time ive bought through amazon, had to EVER come up with a receipt for ANY item on a replace or return, and the only way youre gonna get them to stand behind their product is to register it for the guarantee. the guy at petsafe customer service knew full well the motor was bad, yet they are still selling them. they should be recalled as defective. BAD,BAD NEWS!!! stay away from these guys unless you want to get cheated. instead of going through amazon to contact petsafe i stupidly called them on my own. 97 bucks down the drain...."
1,HORRIBLE,"I highly recommend anyone NOT to buy it. YES, it did work very well at the beginning, but not even 4 weeks, the system broke down and stopped working. Half of the time, they can't even scoop up the litter. I feel really horrible for myself, because I have never regretted to buy a product for my cat until now. It costed me so much and so little use. ONCE AGAIN, DO NOT BUY!"
2,When it worked it was great...,"...but when it didn't, it really sucked. :-( The idea behind this litter box is inventive. It continuously rotates around a rake that sort of acts as an escalator (the best way I can describe it). The poop goes up the escalator, and then falls into a bucket to be dumped later. If this litter box would have worked like it was suppost to, this idea would have been great.The litter box clogs easily. It also isn't very big, so my cat would poop on the very edge. Then the poop would rotate around to the escalator and get stuck to the side of it rather than go up it. When it gets stuck, it makes an awful clicking sound. There really needs to be a safety mechanism that shuts off the box when it gets stuck. Many times the box would get clogged when we were not home to unclog it. There's no telling how long it had been clicking before we got home to fix it."
2,Works good when it works...,"This device does a good job when it is actually working. I have gotten used to pulling apart the motor assembly, cleaning it out, and putting it back together (you know it is time when it starts clicking loudly). You also get used to cleaning off the bottom of the pan because the device does not do it well enough even with premium clumping litter.I would not buy this product again."
2,PetSafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box,"I bought it at the end of May 2012. Set it up the first week in June and loved it! Best litter box I've ever had. But--it quit after only three-and-a-half months. Really loud motor clicking woke me up a few nights ago. The motor has burned out. I'm so disappointed! My cat and I like this litter box so much that I'm going to go ahead and order another, but I'm also going to unplug it at night. Maybe, if this apparently inferior motor gets rested each day, it will last longer.There are so many reviews about the short life of the motor! Why doesn't Amazon communicate this to the company and if they have, why doesn't the company fix this?"
2,"Started off great, but 2 months later I cant stand it","I bought this just after Thanksgiving, I put it together pretty easy and it was pretty nice to just have to empty out the little box and replace the litter every once in awhile. I have it tucked away in a room we dont use often so it doesnt bother me that it makes the motor noises. Also since its a room I dont use often I dont bother cleaning the area except when I empty out the bucket.This product is messy, noisy and over time it wont work (2.5 months).Needless to say I now regret my purchase and I am now looking for a better option."
1,"Queit, but not worth the money","Well, it seems as though this is just a dud of a product. It run non stop. it constantly spins and as a result my cat doesnt want to use it uless its unplugged. It would make a much more useful product if it only ran after the cat went in, like my old one I had which was great. Also, by the end of the first day, it was still pretty quiet but the motor began making noise. Additionally, it cleans so slow, that I really may as well just do it myself. At any rate, I wish I could return this worthless piece of S. I will most likely bite the bullet on this one and end up getting another one of the old kind that I had."
2,Not so good,"I've had this item for a few months with two cats. At first it was great, I can use grocery bags. But, the conveyor gets covered in clay and I can't get it off. And most of the time it turns off because a large clump will lift the hood off the conveyor just enough. So, I have to place a full box of litter on the conveyor hood to hold it down. And the odor control is awful, my house has never smelled this bad. I only recommend it for one small cat."
4,Good litterbox for small to medium cats,"As the pet parent of 5 cats I have tried most of the sub $150 automatic litter boxes and after using this one for 3 months I have to say that this one seems one of the better ones. It is quiet, and for the most part does its job without any problems. I haven't had the issues with litter getting into the moving parts of the box which some other reviewers have mentioned.There are two issues with it that made me give it 4 rather than 5 stars. Number one is that the area available for the cat to use is a bit on the small side for a large cat and so my 2 big male cats don't use it. 2. is that if the litter clump is large it can unseat the cover for the conveyor belt as it is moved up the belt which causes the unit to stop itself until the clump is manually cleared. This only happens infrequently though so it isn't a major issue.Overall I think this litter box is a good value for the price as along as your kitty family isn't solely comprised of larger cats."
3,"Used for 6 months, then switched","This is a nice product, well designed in concept. Works as advertised, nice price, and worked great at first. Then began having problems - started making grinding noises (although this eventually went away), the gears ate one of the plastic bags in the liner tray (required taking the entire thing apart to peel away the wound bag, which was surprisingly easily caught), and then the tray stopped turning (turned out the motor and gears were clogged with litter and litter dust. The motor is now dead). Also, the tray with the litter does not hold the litter all that well - cat flicks it out every time so I have a nice mound of litter just outside the box. Sadly, the litter box is now dead and I'm buying a LitterRobot. I say sadly becaues I think with some relatively minor modifications (v2, if they come out with it) this could be a great machine and I'd consider buying it again. When not dead, the machine worked great and was very simple to operate and use."
2,Broken in 3 months,"I bought this item and started using it in September. It is now November and the product is already broken. I thought it worked well when I got it, but in my opinion, there is not a product out there that is good enough for it to only work for 2 1/2 months. The motor burned up and the box won't turn anymore. Would not waste my money unless mine is just a lemon."
4,love it,I love this litter box. Iv used it for six years. Bought a couple and as all the bugs werent worked out had to have a few replacements. My only complaint is that there should be a site to buy replacement parts. Things can wear out as it runs constantly. Would love to just be able to buy a new conveyor belt or motor when needed.
2,Not for multiple cat households.,"This product worked well for 2 cats the first 6-8 months we had it with reasonable maintenance. Unfortunately, a jam did go unnoticed and this caused the motor to burn out. We purchased a new system, this one too broke down within 2 months of purchase. The construction was slightly different than the original one. We contacted customer service and they sent us a new unit. (Customer service was great.) In the meantime, a stray cat found our door step. We are now on our 3rd system with 3 cats, it has been jamming and needing maintenance regularly. A lot of wasted time, wasted litter, a lot of mess all over the bathroom floor, a lot of funny noises. This time a metal piece broke in half simply from being over stressed. I am throwing in the towel and am going to try Scoopfree. It may be more expensive for the litter, but I will do anything to not have to spend my free time scratching around in a cat box."
5,Works!!,"Works great even with large cats. It may start squeaking and clicking but there's a lot of good advice in some of these reviews. The easiest fix is a squirt of graphite powder where the metal bar rotates against the plastic sides and into the motor, this will stop it. Be sure to use only one plastic bag, and be sure the front part of the bag in the container is low so it does not get caught up on the rotating part of escalator. If you forget to empty it, it will stop on its own as the refuse in the over filled container lifts the lid. It is easy to remove and clean the plastic escalator that that moves the pieces up. Small bits are missed, these can be scooped out when ever you feel they need to be, relative to how they effect you cats."
1,Do not waste your money.,I'm on my 3rd one. The first one's motor broke after just a month of regular (one cat) use. The second one pushed the waste to the bottom of the box and I had to use a screw driver to pry the cemented waste up and then scoop it out manually. This box is actually causing me much MORE work. Take my advice and don't waste your money. I wish I had my money back :(
3,Not what I expected,"it does not pick up the small pieces that stays on the cat sand, I do not like it.I still have to pick up the waste of my cats..... The point of this device was that I did not had to pick up this waste.A good thing is that the work is not as terrible as before..."
4,Works great!,"Works great. Must have a high quality litter, to avoid the clumps breaking little pieces off. But other than that, no complaints. My cat was very interested in it right away, and since I removed her other box, she used it right away, but she has never had issues using any box."
4,"A Well-Designed, Functional Litterbox","I think our cat likes this litterbox almost as much as I do. He hopped right in, and has had no qualms about using it since (about a week now). Since he used to be a bit finnicky about his litterbox - I had to clean it twice a day for him to use it - this is a big improvement.For my part, the Petsafe box is clean, quiet, effective, and low-cost. We're using TidyCats scoopable litter, which works fine, and I take out the bag every couple of days. I would recommend an air freshener - the box isn't airtight, and ours smells a little (could just be our cat :). Finally, as mentioned below this thing really is a work of engineering beauty; it's simple and appears durable. I'm hoping that translates into a longer running life than appears common with some of the other litterbox systems."
2,"When it works -- Great, when it doesn't (and thats a lot) get out the charge card","Works great -- when it works, but the conveyor jams and then the motor starts grinding. Warranty? They have a funny definition -- For $65 I can get a replacement conveyor (unit is just one year old, but hasn't been running past two months due to conveyor issue) So lets see, pay nearly 1/2 again for a product under so called warranty. Don't think so.Don't buy it unless you want to continue to cough up cash. or hair balls."
3,Works but has a few flaws,"This system is way too slow. It takes an hour for it to make one cycle. Clumps tend to pile up in the area by the arm which will make the motor strain a bit noisily. The clumps even piled up and fell onto the floor. Large clumps get broken up into smaller balls, which get a chance every hour to get pulled onto the conveyor belt. If they miss, they continue to go around until you scoop it manually. There's no cover, so odor escapes, litter can get all over and it's unattractive to look at. Since the arm hiding the conveyor system takes up nearly half of the litter box, there's not really enough room for cats to do their business. I've had the Littermaid and the Scoop Free Box. I'm returning the Simply Clean system and hope that someone soon will finally invent the perfect automated litter box."
1,Four Paws Down,"This didn't work from the beginning. Called their customer support who told me I needed to use a toothbrush to clean it out and spray ""Pam"" on the lining. Although the customer support was nice/friendly - it can't make up for a substandard product. It kept 'running' but wasn't rotating to shift the cat poop. This led to my cats 'digging' like crazy - leaving litter and cat poop ALL over the place. The point of this product is to make life easier. This was 10x more laborious & frustrating. I had to empty the container several times manually - it's heavy. There have been many attempts to create a better litter box, but I've yet to see 1 that works & is worth the price. I"
3,"Works great, awsome warranty","Awsome product. I did have a problem when I didn't notice that litter had gotten into the gear underneath and ruined a hard plastic cog. I called into the customer service line and instead of sending me a cog to replace the one I damaged....they sent me a whole new machine! Incredible customer service when compared to Comcast or other large companies. I would give it more stars except that I wish that cleaning the product were better documented. No special, high cost bags to purchase. Just use a 4 gallon cheap trash bag from your local grocery or discount store. Mine is fairly quiet, although sometimes I do hear an occasional few sounds. Worth it though."
4,Mine lasted 17-1/2 months,"Mine lasted 17 months. It broke yesterday. I'm ordering another today. I only paid $69.99 (Amazon), and the current price is $89.99 (OUCH!). The old one cost me less than 14 cents a day. If the new one lasts exactly as long, it'll cost just over 17 cents a day. How worth it is that to not have to scoop, but instead just change out the bag? To me it's worth it. Also, there is some kind of stupid safety switch such that it only works when the cover over the conveyor is on securely, but the working of the conveyor push it up, and the unit stops working. I defeated that stupid switch within the first few weeks by sticking an object down the hole. If you buy one, you may have to do that too."
2,Not for multiple cats,"This was given to me by a friend, and I was hopeful that I'd never scoop litter again! Unfortunately, with two cats, I think the volume was just too great for that little box. I have two cats: one small, and one rather large (over 12 lbs). Instead of carting the litter clumps up the chute, it just shredded them. The more solid pieces (read: feces) went up the chute just fine, but the clumps of urine were shredded and mixed in with the rest of the litter. This device created cat urine cement! I have heard great things from a friend with a single, small cat--so this might be perfect for you if that's your situation. More than one cat, beware!"
2,Lame,"Started out noisy, and then got noisier. It sounds like the mechanism is constantly slipping (like a worn-out gear).I would just use it once a day to scoop it out, because the cats didn't like the noise--even after 3 months of ""getting used to it"" like the instructions suggest. If I accidentally left it on too long, one guy would pee on the carpet because he was so scared of it.It's also huge, taking up an unnecessary amount of space.Overall, a very big disappointment."
1,It did not take long to break,"I was initially excited about this product for my two cats, however withing a month the plastic bag that holds the disposed litter became caught in the rotors. The poop elevator will not work now and poop piles at the bottom of the elevator because the rotor will not turn. After two calls to the company they said they could fix it for fifty dollars!! I told them I just need a diagram that shows how to realign the rotors so that it will turn the elevator again and they refused to do it. One of my cats would never get into the box anyways because of the motor and revolutions of the litter box. A huge disappoint for the money spent."
2,needs improvement,"This does scoop the solid waste into the disposal bucket. However, the liquid waste clumps just get broken up and spread around. It doesn't keep the box from smelling at all. I think if the scooper at the end of the ramp were a solid piece rather than the open scoop that's there maybe it'd work better. ? It's a great idea, but not the best execution. I'm returning mine."
1,Not happy!,"I do not recommend this litter box for anyone. It was a total waste of money and effort. I bought this product looking for a low maintenance litter box and it's not at all what was advertised.1) It does not have the power to work through litter piles causing the system to jam after every use.2) No cover causes a mess outside of the box, and the smell is unbearable.3) The motor gave after one week of purchase. (It burned out because no one was home to even out the litter after the cat for the automatic litter system to work)"
3,I miss it!!,I purchased this litter box at the begnning of November. It has been a lifesaver for the two new kittens that I have. All of a sudden the other day it started to make awful noise and just quit working. I wish it would have lasted longer!!
2,Broke after 3 months,"This is a much quieter box than the littermaid, but my littermaid lasted over a year before it quit on me. This one just stopped working after 3 months! I am not going back to the old traditional box as I just can't seem to go back to scooping manually. I work and go to school full-time and the last thing I want to do when I get home is clean kitty's litter box. He pees like 10 times a day and it creates some large clumping that the automatic boxes help with! I wouldn't purchase this one again, but if you do, make sure you get some kind of warranty."
1,litter box only works for so long before messing up,"I chose this rating due to the face that the Simply- Clean Continuous- Clean Litter Box has only worked for a few weeks before I started having trouble with it. it's making a terrible noise and I don't know why. It clumps up a lot of litter then it stops rotating leaving it spilling out on the sides. I'm in a wheelchair so I got this item thinking it would be easier on me, but now knowing this I stand corrected and am not happy. Its like I'm having to clean manually again.. so the purpose to getting one of these I wouldn't do unless it came with some sort of warranty so I could get it fixed and (me) being the costumer would then be satisfied."
2,Great Idea with weak components,"Im really glad I waited to write this review. At almost exactly six months of use this item no longer functions. On the plus side customer support is great, American English speaking support agents, with a great attitude. I have a replacement part on the way.So the Pros:-uses any kind of plastic grocery bag as a receptical liner.-reduces pet waste odor-Works on a day to day basis without malfunction-can handle nearly a week with two cats-actually easier to clean than first thought, two set screws release the mechanism and allow for removal of the bowl-price is greatThe Cons:-Loud and only gets louder-a bit small for large breed cats-flat busted after six months-even though priced right, am I going to have to buy one each yearI have no doubt that I will be up and running soon, but this is not the machine for someone who is physically unable to deal with repairs or returns."
2,Wondering??,I really need an automatic litter box. I just can't see paying this much money for my Cats to try to Poop in such a little spot?! The Rake/arm appears to be right in the middle of the pan? Has this been a problem Dear Cat owners? Im afraid to order this wonferful invention because of this.
3,"Not great, not terrible, just overwhelmingly OK","I've had this for 2 months. Used by 4 cats: older male, young female with 3 legs, giant 1/2 Maine coon cat male, and the kitten from heck. The 3 legged cat won't go near it, and giant boy really can't fit into it. The other two use it ok. It does the job of removing clumps & droppings fine, but it does make a bit of a clicking noise. Can't hear it from the other rooms of the house, so it's not loud. It's just distracting. 3 stars because it is noisy and because it doesn't fit a wide enough range of cat sizes. All in all, I wouldn't buy it again, but I will continue to use it for as long as it lasts."
3,petsafe simply clean litter box,This product works fair. You MUST use a good clumping litter otherwise it cannot pickup the litter and it sticks and clogs the machine.
2,it works great until it doesnt,"this item works great and my cat loves it. it is so easy to get the poop out and you never have to touch the litter. I only have one complaint about them ... they work until they dont. I have had 2 of these so far and on each one, the motor fails and it stops working after about 6 months."
1,This poo loader is just a piece of poo.,"I bought my product 7 months ago. I have followed the directions, kept the litter to the line, gotten the right litter, empty it frequently, etc. I have 3 cats all under 8 lbs and 2 of them love using it where the third thinks it's possessed and won't come anywhere near it.I have had to replace my unit with the company 3 times. Each one breaks within 2 months of getting it. The company is very willing to replace it, but once the 1 year warranty goes up I'm poo out of luck. The unit will start great for a month. Silent, effective, no smell, fantastic. Then out of the blue it'll start clicking and grinding and finally give out. Worthless!!!! Spend the extra $20 and get something else cause this will only waste your time and energy."
1,"Shoddy construction, lasted 2 months","I purchased this as an inexpensive alternative to other automatic litterboxes. First off, it is extremely awkwardly shaped due to its method of cleaning (revolves at the rate of one revolution per hour). Second, the construction is extremely poor, with the box not functioning at all if all pieces are not at a precisely aligned. Third, it didnt pick up all of the cat waste, leaving chunks for me to sift through later. Either save your money or purchase a more expensive model."
1,Terrible product,"This item is billed as the answer to all your litter box issues and, instead, it's more problems than a standard no-frills litter box. Actually, it's worse because of the expense. The conveyor doesn't convey waste as it is promised; the collection box stinks worse than any open litter box; and, now, the gears have stopped working so the ""continuous-clean"" feature is inoperable. I have one 7 month old kitten. No other pets at all. She just doesn't produce enough waste to burn out the gears on this pricey litter box. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,crappy crapper,I purchased this item and used it for all of 30 days before it stopped working most expensive cat box ever that i still have to scoop and empty. piece of crap!@!!!!
3,Not Silent - But it works,"I have 2 cats, both of whom adapted instantly to the unit. Trouble is litter makes its way quickly under the tray and then grinding begins to sound. Very irritating. I returned the unit."
1,Forever Dead,"I had my Petsafe Simply Clean for one cat for one year. (This cat only peed in her Freshstep litter in this box.) Every three months, one of the motors for this thing would die. Customer service was great and they would get new motors out to me. At about 9 months, they replaced the entire box when it had started making a horrible screeching noise. The warranty is only good for one year and wouldn't you know, it did the screeching noise again within 3 months and we have given up. It has been nothing but trouble. It seems to be that the thing can't handle running continuously, the motors just wear out. Very frustrated because apparently it is difficult to find a good electric cat box."
2,Just not feeling it.,"After reading tons of reviews of various automatic boxes, I finally settled on the Petsafe; and I really tried to like it. The cats used it, but I still had another box avaialble because the design leaves a very small area for a big cat to use. And with four cats I don't want anyone to have to wait too long for a box.Perhaps it's just that my basement is too damp, but the litter would congeal on the floor of the box and on the ramp mechanism - which isn't easy to clean. Also, it doesn't take much josling about for the ramp cover to get out of position which turns the unit off. There were so many things that were close - but just not quit there yet.I used this for a year before trying again with an automatic ScoopFree box. After just a coupld weeks with that, I unplugged the Petsafe and put it aside."
2,Short Life,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas 2011, it worked well for the first 4 months and I was thinking about buying another for my daughter. The motor started getting loader and then quit all together.Update: I called customer service and they sent a replacement at no charge, the new one has modifications and is running quiet, maybe will last longer?"
2,Worked great... for 6 months.,"Worked great for a few months and saved us money on litter b/c you barely ever have to actually change the litter, but mainly just add more. But after 5 months it started acting up, and after 6 months it would no longer work at all."
3,Larger than expected,Unfortunately I was unable to use this litter box because it was so large that I was unable to put it in the cabinet I have my current litter box. I did however change the type of litter I am using and purchased a stainless steel litter pan. This has significantly decreased the smell and was a lot cheaper. The litter I now use is the arm and hammer ultra last. I would recommend it to anyone who has an indoor cat.
3,The best litter box But with a big Problem.,"I have had tried many different automatic litter boxes and without question this is the best.I have two cats and this product works the best of any I have tried (for about a year)The issue with every one is the plastic gear that turns the box.In all three litter boxes I have owned over the last 4 years the gear is the part that has failed.The drive motor failed on one but with the old box in storage I was able to replace it.The manufacturer needs to make the gear more durable and probably also a herring bone gear design.But until it fails it works to perfection, and until I'm broke will continue to buy them."
1,Horrible! Do NOT BUY!,"Terrible purchase...I spent close to $100, which I could barely afford, and now I just want to cry. We've had the litter box for about two months and it has broken down at least once a week. Three times, the bag got sucked into the motor. Other times, the base got unhinged from the bottom wheel and didn't turn. When it did work, my cat pushed all the litter out of it because the base is soooo small. I have had my hands in more cat poop because of this box than I care to talk about...worse thing is, we bought it because I am pregnant and didn't want the risk of scooping and dealing with poop.This is the worse purchase I've ever made. Please don't buy it. Buy any product EXCEPT THIS ONE. You will be sorry if you buy it. Read the other reviews...it is a terrible product that only works for a very small number of people. Odds are, you'll hate it too and lose money like the rest of us have. DON""T BUY!"
3,"okay, but not great.","this litter box works better than a lot of other automated boxes out there, but overall it can be pretty annoying. it works well for a few days, but when it is time to clean out and completely change the litter (which is a little more often than a regular box because the movement seems to break up the clumps a bit), it turns into a pretty big hassle. lots of plastic parts and curved surfaces mean you'll be scraping. a lot. not fun. using arm and hammer to line the surfaces helps a bit, but it's still a pain. also, there's no way to put a lid on this, so if you have an inbred dog, you'll have to figure out how to section it off. i finally gave up and went back to the classic scoop every day box. this was great for weekend trips though."
2,Loud and poorly functioning,"I found the idea of the product very good and plugged it in immediately. One of my cats took to it immediately. The other was reluctant because of the original low mechanical whir which was barely noticeable. We left up the other box to let her have a chance to use the new one....That wasn't the problem.Within 2days, the low barely noticable whir turned into a clicking noise that was obnoxious. I tried many things, including changing litters and adjusting litter height. Too little litter meant nothing got picked up. Too much meant crunching noises above the clicking noise! Another 3 days and I came in to find that the unit was off. I pushed the top on so that it triggered the start mechanism. Came in several hours later and again it was off.It never worked properly after that and I was forced to get rid of it. Not worth the money I paid for it."
1,Don't waste your time....get a cat genie.,"Litter balls fall apart by the time they get to the top of the ramp, making tiny litterballs in the pan that have to be scooped by hand. The ramp jams if the litter ball is stuck to the bottom of the pan, causing the gears to grind. The sides are low, so if you have a cat that covers (aggressively covers as in my case) a large amount of litter is scattered on the floor. So much so, my other cats scooped the scattered litter into a pile and used that instead. The ramp cover is very sensitive. If the cat bumps it, it moves and shuts the unit off. I had to tape it down, or the unit would never run. I have three cat genies, and have had no problems with them. I bought this for a room without accessible water. If you have space in your laundry room or bathroom, spend the money on a cat genie, it is more than worth its weight in gold."
2,"Kinda works, but it's stinky!!!","We thought it was the answer to our prayers for the first few days, but then a stench started to brew!I thought the idea of having a conveyor lift the waste out of the box and into a receptacle was genius! But, it breaks apart the clumped urine, spreading little clumps of urine throughout. The conveyor is also waaaaaaaay to slow. It lifts the poop out just fine, but that looooong and slow journey from the bottom of the conveyor to the receptacle is a stink! Having the poop exposed while it traveled upward just made the area unbearable!Also, the conveyor leaves a minimal area for the cat to do it's business. Our cat pooped on the edge so many times. It was a stinky mess! We returned it."
3,Petsafe Cat box,"Before I purchased this cat litter box, I read many revires on this site. So, to date I feel that the litter box is an ok purchase. It is really loud, I can hear it from two rooms away. I went to the store to get better litter like it asks for and it still is very loud and my bathroom smells really bad now. I think the only benifit of this automatic litter box is that you can use grocery store bags for the waste and it scoops for you. I am still on the fence about this product."
1,not worth the money,"I have to clean it everyday. There's always clumps that clog the conveyer belt, and sit in the litter. Useless."
1,simply clean litter box,"Wow I was really excited about this product until I got home & ""working"". I have 3 kittens using this box. The urine just went to the bottom and stayed there building up as they urinated. The BM's seem to be picked up but not the urine. I have tried 4 different clumping litters getting more expensive litters each time. My finally soloution was too set up old litter box and back to cleaning up every day sometimes several times a day.PetSafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box"
3,Petsafe Review,"Just bought the litter box on line, been in use for a couple of weeks. The only complaint I have is that the urine ends up in little clumps that don't get picked up. So the smell doesn't go away. I'm going to try changing the type of litter, but not sure it will work."
4,"love it, wish my cat did!","My cat used to be an outside cat and just recently started using a litter box (2 yrs). After 2 yrs of a regular litter box I was ready to try something better. This system is amazing! It cleans continuously with little or no smell and uses plastic grocery bags. Plus, it is low cost. The problem is that my cat is afraid of it because of the movement of the tray. The area where the cat goes is also a little on the small side. I would suggest keeping it unplugged until the cat gets used to it or on a timer. I wish I did."
1,Do Not Buy This,"I have never written a review on here before, but this litter box has made me want to. This is the worst design! A conveyor belt? Why? I bought it and it worked for 3-weeks before just stopping. I did everything to try to get it back running...nothing. I hated it anyway. It runs constantly, doesn't get any of the little doody and some ""pieces"" take a day to go up into the bin. I have bought several Litter Maid and they break constantly...then I bought 2-of those that you push over...they work good but my cat wont go in all the time...but they WORK. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
3,smaller pieces fall through and didn't last a year,"This box is great. The only issue I have to make me give it 4 out of 5 stars is the small pieces. The mechanism to lift the used cat liter out of the box has gaps in it which allows small pieces to fall through for me to have to scoop out. Very small problem vs. the scooping of the entire litter box! (pre-automatic) At this point (less than a week) my cat still thinks its a toy. She uses it, then plays in it. It makes a very small ratcheting sound which my cat is mesmerized with wanting to find out what that noise is!After a year, the clicking got louder and louder till it finally stopped working."
2,automatic cat box??,"I bought this box because I needed to be gone away for almost a week. I am so glad I did not get rid of the traditional box. This box does a marginal job at best. It is more work to have than an ordinary box and it always looks bad due to the tiny pieces that never seem to come out. It is the machine that makes these small pieces, cause I never see them in my standard kitty litter box."
5,"Wishing there was a ""cover"" developed for the unit!!!!","I don't know if I am speaking for myself, but I would like to know if the manufacturers of the PetSafe Litter Boxes have a ""cover"" to fit over the units. The unit itself has been working extremely well, the only problem is that the litter gets thrown all over the place when the cats use it. Any suggestions?Thanks!"
5,AMAZING!,"I love this litter box. I have tried so many different litter boxes. I have horrible allergies too, so I have to be careful about how much time I spend with my face over the dusty litter.I have used corn, wheat and clay litters with this badboy and they all work fine. The motors are great. there is a cog that has worn down, but that is my fault for not cleaning it correctly. Definitely worth the $80 even it it only lasts a year. I really think it helps you use less litter too."
3,Broke after one year,"We used this litterbox for one year with multiple break-downs. The biggest problem we had was litter getting kicked into the gears. Every couple months my husband took the unit apart (tools required), cleaned it out, and it would start running again. However, the last time it broke down it was not repairable.We are a 4-cat household and all 4 used this box (er, circle). One cat is very aggressive and burying his waste and kicks litter everywhere. It was very quiet at first but near the end you could hear the gears grinding and components squeaking."
4,great,i had my 1st one for 2+ years and will hopefully have this one just as long.it is so much easier to change plastic bags and add a little litter than tohave to scoop
1,I'm so mad!!!,I didn't want to give this product any stars! I haven't even had this current unit for two months and it is broken! I loved that it was quiet! ...when it worked...I convinced my husband to try one more...because I liked how quiet and that you never had to touch anything but the bag; in theory....another dud...I will buy no more.
1,oh sooo disappointed,"I have a bad back so i thought automatic self cleaning litter box would solve my issue... well week 1 worked as decribed week and till now nothing but issues the waste gets lodged in the box so litter overflows, you have to manually clean it almos 4 times a week ... getting an old fashioned box this week!!!"
2,Didn't last nine months!,"Initially, I liked it for its quiet operation and the waste receptacle that required only plastic grocery bags. Very quickly, however, the motor began to make loud clicking noises. I would clean and fiddle with it, but it would start clicking not soon after. Now, after only eight months, I have to throw it away. Both motors are still operational, but the lower one that turns the litter bin is not functional. I took it apart and discovered that the pin tips of one of the cast gears had corroded off. The gear had no way to remain stable as it turned. Replacement motors are not available. For $100, I expect the mechanism to work for at least a year. I'm very disappointed in the quality of its construction and reliability."
1,This thing breaks after a few weeks!,"I've had 3 different ones of this.2- came from amazon, as exchanges1- came from the company who makes them, as an exchange.All 3 broke or had a defect within 3-5 weeks.Defect 1- Loud noise every so often, like grinding (I thought this was the motor).Defect 2- Pop every so often, I investigated it, and the shifting mechanism that lifts the poop up was bent, no way to fix it except exchange.Defect 3- Metal rod in the shifting mechanism BROKE. A METAL PIECE.I'm done with this. It works perfectly fine the first few weeks and I was looking at the reviews wondering what people were complaining about.The design is solid, the implementation is horrible. Don't waste your time like I did."
1,smelly!!!!!,"So sure this thing works ""ok"", but it made my condo smell horrible!!! It breaks down the clumps and continues to stir every hour releasing the nasty smell of old cat pee! Do not buy this item! I tried it for 2 weeks until I couldn't handle the smell that filled my whole place. I emptied it every day or every other day, but to keep the smell down I would have had to change the entire litter every other day or so. I went back to the old fashioned litter box and there is no more smell. The box is really bulky and definately not worth the price I paid. I am going to give it as a gift just to get rid of it. I will then laugh when they have the same smelly problem. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,Do Not Buy!,"Don't waste your money. Worked well for less than six months then stopped scooping. Placed call to customer service, their diagnosis was a faulty motor and would ship new one out as soon as possible. It has been three months today, repeated calls have resulted in same non-answer. ""part is on back order with no available shipping date known."" Unacceptable, this is not 100% satisfaction guarantee where i come from and never worked well enough to justify cost of replacing unit every 6 months."
3,Thought it ran on batteries !,"We were so disappointed when we discovered that this was electric. We keep the litter box in the bathroom and there is no way to use an outlet as we would end up with an extension cord across the floor or around the room (not very realistic). On a positive note, we LOVE our Petsafe Automatic Feeding bowls (battery operated) purchased 2 years ago from Amazon. I guess that's why I assumed that all of their products would use batteries.The bottom line is, although sad but true, the best of these automatic boxes are probably the REALLY expensive ones ... $200.-$350. !We've been using the Roll Away box, also purchased from Amazon, and we will stay with that. I think it's EXCELLENT yet my husband would like something self cleaning (I don't know why ? I am the one that cleans it daily =:) !)"
1,Do not buy this product...it doesn't work!!!,"I purchased this product because it looks good and you do not have to buy those expensive plastic containers. One week after starting using it the whole room was filled with a nasty smell. The machine is too slow therefore a stinky sludge accumulates in the bottom...it is so hard to remove...I had to wash it everytime I needed to change the litter. I cannot believe that there's not a company that can come up with a good litter box. The litter robot seems to work but it cost a fortune!!! Anyway I do not like these destructive, stinky animals called cats and I am not willing to pay $400 for a litter robot...those animals are not worthy...we have two cats becuase my wife likes them."
3,First Review of this Product,This will be my first review of this product. The litter box appears to be working but I'm not sure if my cat is still using it. I left for a week and when I came home it was empty. I do have a back up and I think she used it. I am suffering from a stiff neck and cannot write any more right now. I'll add when I feel like typing more.
1,Expensive piece of plastic.,"I received this unit and was excited to not have to deal so much with cat waste. Turns out, the waste just gathers at the bottom of the conveyer thing, and it over heats, makes loud clicking noises. I used premium clumping cat litter and filled it to the line. I did everything correctly. The unit spinned, and gathered the waste. It's been 2 days with this unit and it has to go back. Sad."
2,Doesn't last,"Bought this with high expectations. Worked well for about 6 months, loved it. Then it stopped turning rendering it useless. Contacted the company and they sent out a warranty replacement which lasted about 3 months and stopped turning. It's a little expensive for such short term use.UPDATE: I forgot to mention, they charged me a $20 shipping fee because it was over 90 days."
4,Great box for multiple cats.,"I have multiple cats and, currently, a litter of 7 kittens. This box is always clean! I've had it for two months now. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the ticking noise it makes; not particularly loud but it limits where I can put the box. I acclimated the cats to it with it turned off as they tend to get spooked with noises. Now, they could care less.The box makes one very slow revolution per hour so there's no worry about when the cat enters it. And the waste isn't out in the open long enough for my dog to get interested in it. I have tried many litter boxes and I just love this one! Definitely recommended."
1,"Flimsy Construction, Motor Died","This box was wonderful - until it stopped working. The motor died after we had had it for a month. Construction is somewhat flimsy, the lightweight plastic ramp cover does not fit well, and the motor will not run unless the cover is exactly in place. Loved that the litter was constantly cleaned; however, the ramp has to be cleaned almost daily, as feces sticks to the many nooks and crannies of the uphill ramp. Then after you clean the ramp, there is a struggle to get the cover back on properly. The concept is great - would try another one if some improvements were made and there was a reasonable warranty on the motor. It is overpriced based on the current quality."
3,Not too bad,"I myself, am on my second one of these. The motor in my first one started making a really loud clicking noise after owning it less than a year. My current one works pretty well, but I've only had it about 6 months. I have it set on a timer so that it only runs at certain times of the day to try to preserve this motor. For the price and the convenience, I feel like I can't complain too much."
3,Works pretty well,It works really for my cats but the urine clumps sometimes get chopped up instead of put into receptical. This is not a major problem and the litter still seems to stay pretty clean and still much better than before. The only problem I have is that the guard around the spinning pan is supposed to be held in place by the ramp that collects the litter but it seems to come off and spin around out of place. So now I have to tape it to the ramp that is holding it so it won't move.
1,Would not buy.,"Way to small and only dumps the heavier things, it breaks up lighter items. I tried using 4 different types of litter same results. This was a waste of money."
1,Warning - absolute junk (in my opinion),"I have had 3 of these and the 4th is on the way because the motor failed. Not to mention the cats kick all the liter out on to the floor because of the shape. The company does replace the bad units, but you will be spending more time cleaning this piece of junk than you would if you had a regular litter box. Litter gets everywhere and you will need to clean the gears, the lift, the motors, and all the parts because of this. It does not get the poop out of the litter, it leaves a lot of little pieces in the litter going round and round. Tried to get a refund, but they just send another unit in the mail. If you buy one- you have been warned."
3,Noisy,Its noisy. It takes up more space than the old litterbox. The only good thing I can say is that my cat dosen't scatter as much litter outside this litterbox.
1,This stinks!,"This is the worst automatic litter box we've tried yet. The idea of using grocery bags for the dirty litter is great, but the used litter doesn't all go up the conveyor. Actually the pee turns into a big litter donut on the bottom of the tray. This is the worst smelling box too. It also had an odd ticking noise that it made most the time, so my cat would not get in it when it was noisey. He would instead go right in front of it. This was a huge waste of time and money.Stick with the other flawed Litter Made."
1,Did not work at all :(,very disappointed - tried every kind of clumping litter - nothing worked - just tossed the litter box in the trash!
1,stopped working!,i LOVE this litter box. HOWEVER only after 2 weeks of using it.....it stopped working. no power. i plugged it in a different wall unit and still NO POWER! i've cleaned it through and through... NO POWER! UGH! my cats LOVE this box now they are upset.
1,TERRIBLE. A $100 piece of plastic,"We bought this on impulse at petsmart. To be fair, it worked well for 2 weeks, although rotation of the pan would spill tons of litter on the floor. Then all of the sudden the motor burned out. The light remains on, showing power is getting in, but no rotation. Now it's just a piece of plastic.What a complete waste of money. Clearly an immense level of laziness in manufacturing and design.DO NOT BUY"
3,Lasted 3 months,"Lasted 3 months, but company is replacing. It is noisey. There has to be a better and affordable option out there."
2,2 1/2 months,"It started clicking within 3 days and by 2 1/2 months it died. Motor is still humming but the belt won't work, motor is HOT, Amazon said they only guarantee it for 30 days so $100.00 down the drain. Thanks Amazon"
2,Instant Breakage - Total Mess,"Mine simply stopped working within three days. The conveyer belt continued to operate, but without the rotation gear in motion, it was useless. I cleared all the dust from the gear mechanism, but it didn't help.I didn't fight to get a refund because I was probably going to switch back to my hold box anyway. The ""lip"" around the outside of this box isn't very high, so when the cats kick to bury their droppings, it sprays litter all over the ground within about a 16-inch radius.Total mess."
2,Ummmmm,So I think the idea behind the PetSafe Simply Clean litter box is good but both of my cats are afraid of the moving box. Although it is moving very slow my cat's are scared of the movement. Both of them placed their paw in the box just to check if it was moving. If it's moving they won't use it and I have even seen one pee outside of the box because of that. I now have a timer on it so it's not moving all day but that kind of defeats the purpose...
1,Defective,"Purchase one, set it up. Base worked for 1 day, conveyor did not move at all.Order a replacement. Got it out of the box, plug it. Dead. Did not turn on at all.Amazon does a great job on returns and refunds."
2,"Great idea, but disappointing...","I switched from Littermaid LM 900 to give this one a try. My cat was very reluctant to use it, then when she did use it, she proceeded to let litter fly wherever. It was her personal disdain for this litterbox - oh well, you never have to wonder what cats are thinking - EVER. That's why I love cats so much! LOL. It eventually had some of the other problems mentioned with the motor straining and where the litter would pile up as it rotated. It eventually gave out after 4 months, and wore me out keeping litter swept up. The next automatic litterbox I tried was worse than this, so I am now going back to a Littermaid LM 900 until someone can invent something that will work better than this without costing a small mint. I never had trouble with my 3 year old Littermaid and was wondering why I got rid of it for this, and then the worst disaster after that. Just beware."
5,Awesome Litter box.,Works great. The litter box stays clean without having to change the litter all the time. Its quiet and my cat loves it.
3,I'm still cleaning litter!!!!,"I have 5 cats, and was hoping to make it a little easier to deal with the litter cleaning. I have two regular litter boxes and this one. First of, let me say that this does absolutely do the job, and it is very quiet. However, I am constantly cleaning up litter, from the OUTSIDE of the box!!! This product would get 5 stars if it had a hood. Another thing is that I usually use the litter crystals, but with this one, I have to use the clumping sand. Which now means I have to buy 2 different sets of cat litter. All in all, this does the job as described, but be prepared to get a lot of litter on the floor outside it..."
3,alright automatic litter box,This litter box is very quiet like it says and it does work well if your cat only pees in their litterbox but if it poops all it does is crush it into smaller pieces and spread it throughout the litter box. which isnt because you still have to manually clean that up.
1,Doesn't work,"I really wanted this to work, but it has fatal flaws, all noted in the other bad reviews (I suspect that some of those who gave it good reviews haven't had it long enough for it to start acting up). Bought one, which worked great until it stopped working after a month. Dead. Exchanged it, and the second one worked fine until it ate the bag (the bag got caught up in the mechanism and wound itself tight around the spindle). I don't have the patience to get in there and pick it apart, so there it sits, disassembled, until I get another box."
5,Total Satisfaction!!,"Well it has been 1 week since I unpacked and set up my unit. Installation and set up was a snap, even without the directions. Unit runs quietly and both of my cats took to it right away with no issues. One is 12# the other is 17# and are able to climb aboard and do their business no problem. I am forced at times to leave my guys alone for extended periods of time and the poop container was good for 3 days without having to empty the bag. I love the fact that I only have to use a shopping bag for this and have no more added costs. I use Freshstep litter and the unit does nicely but will not pick up the smallest bits and peices, I can live with that and don't really think it is an issue at all. Now I am wondering what the longevity of the unit will be. So until it poops out I give it 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!"
3,Pet safe Ok but not up to expectations,The products performance is average. It mechanically intervenes with cat litter as promised but needs a full scoop out once a week. This is to lift @ a 1/4 inch of clay wet litter that is stuck to bottom of rotating pan. The stool is lifted into the receptable but the lifting mechanism does not have enough down pressure force to skim the bottom of the pan. I sprayed the rotating pan with silicon spray and it helped somewhat but still needs every 2 weeks full clean out.
4,"Needs a few adjustments, but a pretty good product.","I bought the PetSafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box from Amazon about 6 months ago. I loved how quiet it was and my cat didn't have any issues with it. I just didn't like the smell. The urine clumps would break up during the cleaning cycle and leave little bits of all over the clean litter. It started to stink pretty quickly. I only have one cat, he's a big one, but I didn't remember his litter ever smelling so bad. So, I went back and read the reviews on Amazon for this product. I remembered one guy saying that he plugged the litter box into a lamp timer. So, I went to the store and got a cheap timer that you plug your lights in to make it look like you're home when you're on vacation. I have it set to turn on the litter box 4 times a day for 1 hour. That took care of my smell problem. Now my only problem is remembering to empty the bin on a regular basis. It's so quiet I forget it is there."
2,"Worked fine for 5 months, then quit!","This item worked fine for the first 5 months. But it has now quit working. It is a good concept it just needs some tweeking. I like the handsfree, but it should have some sort of cover. The litter goes everywhere when it is used. I don't have any idea why it quit working, just died. So beware!"
1,You've Got to Be Kidding!,"The game footage here is very good, except it is constantly interrupted, and has no continuity. Some of the interviews seem genuine, while others are obviously staged. The students and players act as if they were given the green light by the director to be as gross and obnoxious as possible. In that, they succeeded.Entries at the Sundance Film Festival must be awful indeed for this film to be a Grand Prize nominee. The coaches stand around in the locker room, while the players take turns giving each other the cursing of their lives. I was rooting for the opposing team to give Massillon a beating every game.I can't recommend this film to anyone. It doesn't teach about football, the language is awful. I don't feel I know anything about Ohio football that I didn't know before I saw the film. I hope the Tigers are not a typical team in Ohio.For a real football film, I recommend ""The Last Game""."
3,hometown,"I grew up in massillon ohio. it was where i was born and raised. while i may not like football, and i may not have succumbed to the hysteria surrounding the massillon/mckinley games, i loved being there. and i would just like to say in defense of my hometown, this movie was hyped beyond belief. everything in it is rather exagerated. yes, some of those people are lunatics about thier football, to the point of insanity, but its not really how its portrayed. i gave it three stars because i wasn't actually sure what to do! i was proud of the recognition, but slightly upset that so many people, people who have never been to massillon, never even heard of it, have nothing but horrible things to say about it because of this movie. yes, teenagers get drunk. they get tattoos and piercings. that's happened since the beginning of time. kids are kids. these ones were just caught on tape!"
3,It's a shame,"Well, I really wanted this saw. It is by far the necest looking saw of it's type and had all the controls and markings such that even my girlfriend can see them (she likes it too).I have several other Bosch tools that I'm very happy with.I was worried though after reading some of the reviews, especially the one's listing spindel play. My hopes were revived by another review that claimed this was a problem on the ""first generation"" saw.So I hopped over to the local tool store to look for myself. Held my breath, wiggled the blade, clunk clunk, &&*%%^%! Looking up inside the saw you could see noticable play on the spindel and a good +/-.020"" play at the blade edge. Not giving up I asked how long they had this saw (hoping for the first generation thing). ""Came in last week!""Finally I tried the same test on four other brands they had, at least seven different saws and none showed this blade/spindel play.Price is not really an issue but I can make scrap wood a lot cheaper on my bandsaw."
2,Disapointed,I seen the Bosch 4412 at the home show in Las Vegas Jan. 04 and could not wait to get home to buy one. I found one at a local tool suppler on Feb 3 and am returning it today Feb 4. The wobble in the blade is totaly unacceptable. I own a trim company in north west Florida and we do high end homes on and near the beach. We could really us a saw with the features that are offered on the 4412 but without the wobble.
4,On second thought...,"In my December review I noted that I would be returning the saw to my dealer. As a second thought I decided to keep it because of the oustanding features that no other manufacturer currently offers. After working through some issues with ... S-B power tools, the saw has since performed very well. As a finish carpenter of high end homes, the demand for accuracy is paramount, and with some tweaking and the addition of a Forrest Chopmaster blade and stabilizer, I feel that this has been accomplished. In a perfect world the saw would be more robust in a few areas, but if I asked for it to be designed to my ideal specifications, it would probably weigh 200 pounds. All in all, a well thought out saw with time saving features when using large trim and stair parts."
3,Apprehensive buyer,"After falling in love with the Bosch 10"" single bevel compound miter saw three years ago, I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this saw. I must admit that after reading all the reports of inferior cuts, I am a little nervous about buying this saw. I am a finish carpenter in Aspen CO, who works on the finest homes, where there is no room for error (which is why I have scrapped my Dewalt, and am buying a new saw). I have looked the saw over at the local hardware store and look forward to using it. But, if it fails to provide a perfect cut, then back it will go! I will write back to rate it after a few months of using it.I am writing this in hopes that BOSCH will see their saw through the perspective buyers eyes, and know what's important to them.I own several BOSCH tools and love them all and expect the same high standard, precision tool I have enjoyed previously."
2,Order Summary #002-4830315-1592062,"I ordered the captioned which is made in Germany according to your Technical Data.H'ever, 'Made in Taiwan' is printed on the box of the saw delivered to me today.T'fore, you are kindly requested to give me RMA # and the credit and let me know return method by e-mail ASAP.B/RegardSung Yoo"
3,Bosch 4488 PLATINUM+4 Spark plugs,"I like the spark plug design looks durable and solid. Performance? I can't really tell the difference, maybe gives you very little performance not so much to notice. I have installed this in my 02 Ford escape, my purpose was to save gas. My result? Nothing much, feels like same ordinary spark plugs."
5,Christian-Azul,Christian's voice on Azul is Amazing. This is by far one one of my favorites along with Mi Vida Sin Tu Amor and Lo Mejor De Mi. Please check them out!
2,"Blue, like a box of Sominex.","Did you like Alejandro Sanz's ""El Alma Al Aire"" but find it a just little too raw, too rough? Never fear. Cristian/Christian/Christian Castro and producer Kike Santander have delivered the ultimate in overblown orchestral quasi-sentimentality. Castro hits some really high notes on this CD, but why? Does it convey feeling? No, all it conveys is ""Hey guys, I am a Singer, so take me seriously."" Nothing but deep cynicism explains the choice of ""Azul"" as first single and title track. I don't know which is worse: the fact that it's a limp rewrite of his far superior 1992 hit ""No Podras,"" that it has insufferably corny lyrics, or that despite all that, it's actually one of the album's most energetic songs.The tabloids should quit worrying about who his latest girlfriend is--the NINETEEN pictures of Castro in the CD liner suggest that his No. 1 fan is...himself."
4,Not bad for the money,"Have had this product for several months now and it works great. One of my watches stopped working from lack of winding in the machine but I think I need to put it on a setting that rotates the watch more frequently. You can set up four programs for each of the four winders in the box. There is a pop-out tray that can hold pens or thin watches that can lay flat. I'm using it for pens.The material is very good quality and the hinges rival those of products costing 3x more. The only obviously cheap part is the bottom of the pop-out tray. It's just a paper cover. Because of that, you can see a slight, thin white line at the bottom front of the tray.I would recommend this product at this price point.Update: I've put the winder away. It doesn't work very well with Seiko kinetic watches. With the regular automatic style watches, the watch has to be placed rather precisely in order to for it to be wound. I believe the winders are not horizontal enough to be completely effective."
5,Watch winder,"This works well, looks rich and doenst take up too much room. I like the fact that each watch has its on on off switch."
5,Excellent,"I listen to this all day long sometimes. It is just great. The quality is great and the music itself is great, nice and relaxing...."
2,Cute For Decoration,"I bought these towels for my bathroom, which I am course doing Little Mermaid theme. They are very cute, BUT very cheeply made. So they are for decoration only. I don't let anyone dry their hands on them..decoration only!"
5,Trust!,"A great Single EP, Trust is a solid tune, Megadeth 90's classic and the 2 live trax here are awesome. Tornado of souls with the classic line up what's not to like?"
3,"Daisy Outdoor Products Daisy Black Gun Sleeve (Black, 40"")","For what it is- it is okay albeit it is not a genuine Daisy product. It should have been listed as a Daisy-like made product. Otherwise, for the price, and for what it is intended for, it was a good buy."
3,Zipper broke the first time my child pulled it.,Zipper broke the first time my child pulled it. Contacted Amazon and the sleeve was not available for replacement. They discounted product $2.00 for my inconvience. I replaced zipper pull from an old zipper I had. Works fine now.
2,Not the best product,"I opened the package before we gifted it. Thankfully! The zipper handle broke off the first time I tried zipping it. Very cheap zipper. It is a sleeve, not a padded case."
4,decent quality for the price,"decent quality for the price, i have ordered two of these for my daughters. does what it is designed to do hold a gun and keep it from getting dusty and beat up"
1,Junk zipper,I bought two of these. The zipper on both broke after the first use. This bag is junk. No one could have possibly tested this product.
2,Zipper is very cheap,"The zipper is of very poor quality. It closes easily but when you try to open it binds. Disappointed in the ""Daisy"" quality, would not recommend."
1,Black 40 inch gun bag,"The Zipper was so cheap, when it was unzipped to put the gun in it broke. Kept it because it would cost to much to send back."
2,Bad Zipper!,Purchased two and both zippers broke on 1st pull. Do yourself a favorite and don't buy this case! Wish I read the reviews before purchasing this case...
1,Big disappointment. Worth $8.00 ?? I don't think so.,Junk zipper broke on the first try. No daisy logo on case. I would not have purchased this if I read the reviews. I trusted the Daisy brand name for providing the best case for my Daisy gun. Unfortunately I asked them to send me a new one. If this one breaks too I will have to persue a better case. Chinese crap don't buy!!
3,Best in small doses,"Pulse Legion is one of the finest of the ""nameless"" goth/industrial dance groups - meaning that, upon hearing them, you'll know you've heard them before on the dance floor, but you won't remember a single lyric or synth riff. The problem is that every song sounds very nearly the same - when you're first introduced to the throbbing, irresistable rhythm of this music, you'll want for it to succeed - and it does, if you listen to a single song. But as an entire work, it soon becomes extremely repetitive (one reason why they're a dance floor staple but the favorite group of almost no one). The one saving grace here is the beautiful reworking of Torn Within, featuring the beautiful vox of Amanda Jones. Their finest moment! Perhaps even enough to justify purchasing this otherwise lackluster-plus CD."

1,They don't stick,"Four of the first set of five strips came off after two showers, the fifth came off a day later. I complained and asked for a refund. I received a very polite letter and eventually a replacement package of the same strips. Once again, four of the five replacement strips peeled after a few showers. The fifth strip is stubbornly holding on as this is being written a few days later. The strips were intended to replace several of the Rubber Maid strips I had used for over 15 years, most of which are still tightly in place and doing their job. It's a pity that Rubber Maid no longer makes the product."
2,THROW IT IN THE WASTE BASKET,"This book should be thrown in the waste basket. I have no doubt that Mr. Gallardo knows his stuff, but he really can't explain it to an average MAX user. Majority of book was full of run-on sentences and prepositional phrases strung together. His writing style was so distracting, I had to throw the book in the waste basket to calm me down. I have the feeling that Mr. Gallardo had to fill those pages so the book will look more impressive. Don't impress me. Stop printing this book and save the forest."
3,A little tricky to apply,"Note that the product does not contain any reflecting elements (e.g., glass spheres) but depends on the droplets themselves solidifying in the air before sticking to the surface.I bought this coating to apply to my curb house number to increase its visibility. I applied the stuff over a white background and according to the directions and checked using a flashlight that night - and did not see any particularly notable reflectivity at all.I then experimented on a small piece of white cardboard it took 2 tries to find just the right application technique:Basically you need very gentle small puffs of spray from 18-24"", allowing the droplets in each puff to solidify before reaching the surface. My earlier attempts used too much product.I'll try again on the curb strip but any kind of wind at all will make the application very difficult."
2,Color Duped,"Not so good if you're looking for reflective paint. You'll do better to buy some reflectors, this hardly reflects unless its hit directly with the light source."
2,try silver instead,"I used this on my black plastic car bumper, and it turned white. From far away it looks kinda glossy, but up close it is a disaster. I would try looking into the silver instead."
2,I give it a 2,"Don't get me wrong,there is some useful information in here.But it is very basic.Don't buy expecting to learn the basics of cpr.You will learn what to do till help arives.This would be good to have your employees watch as part of a safty program.Very basic."
2,Boring,"very boring.cheaply produced. understandable to people who already know the information. Scouts, or other groups will be bored by the lack of titles, visuals, and other items that would make it interesting. the only group this would be appropriate for is Navy Seals (which he is) that have some background and are used to sitting and being lectured.I bought it to show to Scouts and will not use it."
5,Up All Night!,I'm giving this review with my eyes half closed. I was up all night reading this book. I got a couple of Katherine Sutcliffe's books this week and I'm seriously impressed with her writing. Renegade Love is an unforgettable romance.
5,Best on the topic,"I had jokingly talked about getting into the porn industry for several years prior to buying this dvd. After seeing it on Amazon, I decided to buy this out of curiosity. Having watched the first dvd and parts of the other ones, I must say that I found this very informative. It opened my eyes to a lot of things I hadn't even considered about the business. I now have even more respect for the women and especially the men of the porn industry. It's a lot harder than it looks."
3,Almost got it...,"This is a very constipated read. For such a small book, it took me more (a lot more) than the usual. Although I found very interesting the works, and photographers, chosen, it lacks works, and photographers, that will make it a complete reference guide.It leaves you wanting more, but still good a learning experience."
2,I'm not at the right photo level to read this and give a fair rating,As a follow up of a review in Business week did buy this book which I find good to look at but almost impossible to read as suchSorry
5,A must see!,"A great independent horror film. Not horror as in blood and gore, but Suspenseful and extremely provocative. Some of the exploitation scenes are very graphic, but a fun movie overall. Great acting and production value for an idie film. highly recommend this one. A fun ride!"
1,very disappointed,"I ordered this item in pink. It came it ""drop cloth"" beige. The fabric quality is very poor. I could have bought these at any discount store. Of all my Amazon puchases, this has been my only disappointment. I will keep them to save the hassle of a return."
4,good storage,these boxes are the perfect size for under the bench in my loft. I have toys and legos and games in them and they look nice while hiding all my stuff.
1,I hate it,"I didn't know that region 2 dvd's meant i couldn't use the dvd on my dvd player so im kinda screwed, wont make that mistake again"
1,region 2,"i didn't know what region 2 was , the dvd will play on my computer but not dvd player I should have researched it more"
1,did NOT play!,would not play ...and whatever is region 2 is the problem. Sure wish someone told me what region means prior to wasting my money on.
1,Movie doesn't work,"The movie does not work. I have tried five different players. We we start the DVD we get an error message. I don't have the receipt to return the DVD. When we received the DVD, it was loose in the package. My son really wants the movie. Any way to return without receipt? Of all the movies I ordered, this is the only one with a problem."
3,"Not a slam dunk, but not an airball either...","The Air Up There (1994) While there are absolutely no surprises in this comedy from Disney, at least it's pleasant and fairly entertaining. Kevin Bacon (Apollo 13) plays a hotshot assistant coach who travels to Africa to recruit a Winabi tribesman for his team. Once there he runs into all of the expected problems and culture shocks. I recommend this one to basketball nuts and the rainy Saturday afternoon crowd."
2,The air up there is pretty thin,I saw this with a few friends six years ago. One seemed a little annoyed with the early plot. I didn't care too much for the movie in general. It was insipid.I'm no highbrow but I expect comedies to be a little more sophisticated.
1,DECEPTIVE SELL TACTICS!,"I ordered a DVD from the vendor on August 15th. Although I was advised that the estimated delivery date was from Sept. 10 to Sept. 23 (surprising in itself, since I usually get orders pretty quickly when ordering from Amazon), the item arrived fairly quickly. However, I was shocked, disgusted, and angry when I tried to play it and kept getting an error message that said it wouldn't play in this region. It turns out that this is a U.K. DVD, which is Region 2, and the U.S. is Region 1. I did not know about region differences and THIS INFORMATION WAS NOT IN THE SELLER INFORMATION WHEN I PLACED THE ORDER. After the fact, when I looked at seller feedback and comments on the ad page, I saw that many other sellers had the same problem. I returned the DVD to the seller via UPS (which has confirmed delivery) and emailed the seller requesting a refund, but no response yet. Because of this experience, I will NEVER order from this vendor again."
1,Waste of Money,"The movie does not play on my DVD or blue ray player. When you complain the company starts talking formats, but if it doesn't play on US players, why is that not made clear in the listing. What is Region 2? Amazon should not be permitting vendors to offer products that don't work on US electronics without clearly identifying that the product is not designed for such equipment. Region 2 is meaningless. Then to top it off, the cost of returning the product makes it not worth the effort. Stay away - bad deal."
4,"I liked it, so did the 6 other guys that watched it with me","This is one movie you'd want to see, there's quite a few basketball movies out there but this one seems to top them all (thats mine opinion). For those basketball enthusiast I know you will like this! As for the rest of folk, there is alway something out there you'd like....."
1,weak,who thought of this mess? Kevin Bacon is one of the most-overrated actors ever.this does no justice to Basketball or to the MOTHERLAND.a complete mess.
3,The Gods Aren't Angry,"This movie was great, but I don't like some of the camera angles. I loved Everything is Spiritual and this just doesn't add up."
5,Great Teaching,"I would have to say, that i had been anticipating this release for some time now. Rob is a favorite of mine (which isnt uncommon today) and i thought a topic like this would suit him well. The thing i most enjoyed about it was his constant comparision to old testament sacrifices and the Grace of God. This video played much more like a sermon that his 1st release ""Everything is Spiritual"", which was more like a lecture. This release also explained what the Gospel is in a way that i have never thought of before. I am honestly thinking (as a pastor) that if you have someone with doubts in the existence or even love of God, allowing them to borrow The Gods Arent Angry and Everything is Spiritual may dismiss their doubts and get them on the path they need to be before they even set foot into a church service. Thank God for teachers like Rob Bell who speak in a way that even the biggest biblical novice could comprehend 10,000 years of history.100% Recommend."

5,Dogs as Folk Art,"This collection of woodcuts of man's best friend are witty, well-crafted and appeal to the dog lover who is sick of all the cutesy doggy stuff on the market. The poems range from serious to whimsical, but the art is the reason to buy this book. a very affordable way to collect great art. i recommend this book as a gift for dog people and art people."
3,Short But Sweet,"""Doggerel"" is a small collection of 19 poems about dogs. Some of the pieces are sentimental, others are strange, and some are downright silly - but they're all enjoyable. The accompanying illustrations are a bit of a disappointment, though - a little too cartoonishly abstract for my taste - and they don't really complement the poetry.""Doggerel"" is worth the money, as long as you can find a cheap copy."
2,"Good concept, poor execution","I was excited about this product. Kids are so used to hand-held gadgets (PSP2, MP3 players, etc.) that I thought this was a great idea. I envisioned my kid ""playing"" with it while traveling to sports events and in study hall at school, to supplement books and Kaplan software. My kid liked using it, for about 2 weeks.That's how long it took for the LCD screen to develop a huge blob which made the screen completely unreadable. And you guessed it, the screen is not covered by the warranty so Franklin won't replace the unit. The case is semi-soft, which is not enough to protect the unit in the average backpack. If you do decide to get this unit, be warned that it's fragile despite the fact that it's evidently designed to be carried around by teenagers. I won't waste my money again buying another unit for my younger kid."
2,Good idea..but not a good product.,"I was really pretty excited about this when I first got it. As a very busy student this was a great way to get a couple questions in when I had the time. In general I liked the idea, but its lacking in several points- It takes forever to read anything. You have to scroll up and down to read a question and go back down to the answers.-The drills are useless. More like games than test prep, which is not what I need.-After 3 months of fairly light use, the down key broke. This made it impossible to do anything.I liked the concept, but in retrospect I wish I had just bought the book."
4,it's not the worst!,"this album is good, it took me a couple of listens to let it really sink in. right away I found Stone Of Love my favorite. I do however think that the boys were better off writing thier own lyrics, or hooking up with the old masters Richard Meltzer and Sandy Pearlman. the best B.O.C. stuff ever, was co written by these two. and we can't forget the hours of killer songs written by and with the infamous Bouchard brothers, Albert and Joe. (they gave us Astronomy) but back to this album... it is good, and I would suggest anyone wanting some fresh original rock and roll to pick it up."
2,Must be really huge fans with no musical taste.,"I can't get over all these 4 & 5 star reviews. I really think this album [stinks]; and I'm a huge B.O.C. fan. Lyrics like, ""It's good to be hungry when you're going to eat. It's good to be angry when you're going to scream."" Yeah...that's worth five stars. Buck Dharma is still one of metal's best guitarists, but come on....you've ridden the ""Reaper"", ""Burnin' For You"" song clone wave long enough. Honestly, without the Bouchard Brothers onboard, Three Oyster Cult just can't cut it. Buy ""Secret Treaties"" or ""Tyranny & Mutation"" instead. The remasters are ten times what this album is not."
2,"""Curse"" is RIGHT...","... I WAS a longtime BOC fan up to this point. What the HELL happened on this album? One would think America's greatest guitarist, Buck Dharma, would make a decent producer. Or at LEAST he'd play the incredible searing leads that propelled BOC for the last 30 years. But he DIDN'T!!! This album is POP! Decent Pop, since BOC are skilled musicians, but do you buy a BOC album to HEAR Pop?! NO, you buy it 'cause you want to hear ROCK! And Curse of the Hidden Mirror rocks ONCE, on ""One Step Ahead Of The Devil"", and then it's back to ELEVATOR MUSIC!!! Sorry, guys, I'll just buy your remasters from now on."
4,fan review,"I really like these guys music from early works on.This album is good,but not as good as heaven forbid.For fans BOC really."
4,A good one,"Curse of the Hidden Mirror is considered by some folks to be Blue Oyster Cult's best recording in twenty years, at least since Fire of Unknown Origin. I'm not sure of that appraisal but, certainly, this album contains some very good material. There's a couple of dark riff tunes ('Old Gods Return', 'One Step Ahead of the Devil'), moments of pure pop bliss ('Pocket', 'Here Comes that Feeling'), and some longer semi-epic tracks, like 'Stone of Love'. I won't say that this is as good as their early albums, which are still tops, but clearly they got their act together for this one. The only track that falls short is the rather lame 'Just Want to Be Bad'. Hidden Mirror is not likely to break BOC out of their status as a ""cult"" band, but it is a treat for the faithful fans."
4,BOC Has Still Got It!,"Excellent! This may be BOC's best album to date. The songs are good and the production is tight. Buck did a terrific job. I'm sure Stone of Love (written by the same guys who wrote Burnin' For You) will become a Cult classic. Also, the cover art is way cool. Eric and Buck's vocals sound a little weaker than they did thirty years ago, but not by much. All in all, this is still a very tight band."
3,Sleek and has a couple of hits but unnecessary,"Production here is definitely better than on Heaven Forbid and the album is pretty consistent but the quality falls once you pass the midpoint. Second half is rather weak. ""Dance on Stilts"" is very good, ""Show time"" and ""Pocket"" are very familiar, very old BOC-style rockers; they are ok but do not rise to the level of their best work. Once again, I recommend a visit to the library but not to the record store."
3,Another album under further review.,"""Curse Of The Hidden Mirror"", was a 5 star release when it was first released in 2001, but after listening to it again several times it's a solid 3 1/2 star release. Tunes I still enjoy are, ""Dance With Stilts"", ""Pocket"", ""Here Comes That Feeling"", the classic Buck riffer ""Stone Of Love"" and ""Eye Of The Hurricane"". I would really like BOC to record 1 more album together by the original band, it would be a great thing, but Albert, Joe and Allen would have too agree to it."
4,Love It!,"First let me say that I am a very casual BOC fan. I got into them around when Fire Of Unknown Origin came out and didn't really follow them after that. I stumbled across this album only recently and was blown away. It's just a great straight forward rock album that sounds great sonicly. Dance On Stilts, Pocket, Old Gods, and the almost popish Here Comes That Feeling are stand outs for me. It's a shame that these guys don't have a record deal right now. I would like to see what else they have left in the tank."
5,Another pearl...,"It seems like Blue Oyster Cult just won't stop doing it. That could be a good thing, could be a bad thing. There's still several '70's bands roaming the earth, but few are still recording. In BOC's case, it's great that they refuse to call it a day. This is a great, old-school hard- rock effort, worthy of their legacy. There's not really any filler, as each song has at least a few things to offer. There are standout tracks: 'I Just Like To Be Bad', 'Dance On Stilts', 'Eye Of The hurricane' and the magnum statement of intent, 'The Old Gods Return'. I feel that any of these tracks would've fit on any other BOC album. Powerful, yet still characteristically subtle-- in other words, prime Blue Oyster Cult. The old gods have yet to lose their touch."
1,True BOC Fans BEWARE,"""Curse"" is Absolutly the WORST BOC Disc EVER. Do Not buy it!I Have Been A FAN for over 30 years and have seen them live at least 50 times.Instead seek out the ""Stalk Forrest Group"" limited Edition CD Which is very early Cult and is 100 times better than this new peice of ...! Send a Message by not purchasing this disc.Buck How Could you do this to us????Sick.A.D."
1,sorry to say this...................,"First of all, i`m a huge fan of BOC since secret teatries, but... DON'T waste your money in this piece of garbage, all the cd it's boring, boring,. ( it would be nice to see again the original BOC, with s.pearlman and the bouchard brothers)"
2,A Few Good Moments,"Well, ""Curse..."" is a slight improvement over ""Heaven Forbid""(closer to a 3 actually, 2 1/2 ? if that was possible), but even though I've always loved this band, gotta admit that their writing hasn't quite been there for years. Lyrically, this one occassionally borders on embarassing. Sure Roeser's guitar is in top form and this is well recorded, except for the bass, which is clicky and irritating. Bloom's songs are a big improvement over the last release, and I can't find fault with his singing which is top notch here. Stylistically ""Curse..."" is also a little more consistent then it's predecessor. I did expect a little more after listening to the song samples here,but the CD itself is not totally satisfying. Don't expect a Secret Treaties or even a Stalk Forrest Group (get ""St. Cecelia"" it's excellent!!!)and you won't be as dissapointed."
4,"BOC/4TH & BSt. Feb.12th,03/8pm","Curse of the hidden mirror is an outstanding CD. Dance On Stilts-Showtme-The Old Gods Return-Pocket-One Step Ahead Of The Devil-I Just Like To Be Bad-Here Comes That Feeling-Out Of The Darkness-Stone Of Love-Eye Of The Hurricane-Good To Feel Hungry. I went to see BOC here in San Diego,Ca.(USA)and like wine they just get better and better as time goes on. I have most of all their CD's. The BOC COLLECTION!!! Such a supurb show!! Their are alot of bands that are no longer together. I cherish the opportunity every year when they come back to 4th & BSt. Their style of music and members are exceptional. Those that appreciate good music will appreciate this CD."
4,Essential to the collection,"Almost 180 degrees from Heaven Forbid this disc is a must-have. Most of BÖCs fans have listened to them for many years, and you won't be disappointed here. The song lengths are down from previous releases, and I think Buck produced the album. But he doesnt hog the spotlite - in all its a good showcase for everyone's talents. BÖC definitely does their own thing.Now, each song has just enough masterful guitar to whet yer appetite. Its the lyrics here that get the emphasis. Add this one to your collection now. The musicianship is of course flawless and it left me hungry for the next album."
1,Initially good but compresses with use,"Ordered this for my father, who has trouble getting into and out of cars due to back problems. He initially liked it: Comfortable and gave some added height. However, after very little use by a rather small man (150 pounds) he found it uncomfortable. The foam padding compressed thus resulting in an uncomfortable seat cushion that felt like sitting on metal."
3,Not for Sears Professional Routers,"Although it claims to fit ""All Sears"" Routers, there are no hole sets for the Sears Professional Series Routers, which have a four screw configuration, as opposed to three for the smaller Craftsman routers.Otherwise, it's an OK product. The bushings are steel, and the baseplate is plastic."
2,3 Out of 8 Films Wouldn't Play,"Of the 8 films included in this set-The Lodger, Sabotage, Young and Innocent, Rebecca, Lifeboat, Spellbound, Notorious and The Paladine Case-3 wouldn't play-The Lodger, Rebecca and Notorious. Actually I didn't even attempt to play Lifeboat or Paladine. I was fed up by that point. I'm curious to know if others had the same problem? Whenever they release a dvd set I always seem to run into this problem. Anyway I can't recommend it mainly for that reason. I also didn't care for the photo album package to be honest. Its width made it a little bulky for my shelf."
2,Recall candidate,"Like others reporting here and elsewhere, several DVDs in this collection vibrated horribly when played in a Sony DVD player (DVP-CX995V), but when I attempted to return them to the retailer (not Amazon), they played OK in two other models of DVD players they had, and therefore wouldn't take them back (nor would the media company). If you browse the Internet, you will see that this collection has a horrible quality/compatibility history. That this collection is still on the market without a recall (or exchange offered) is a crime. Welcome to the decade of greed (blaming the distributor, not the retailer)."
2,Excellent films - Poor quality control,"I was looking forward to this set. Originally, just for the very hard-to-get ""Rebecca"", but the other fine films led me to pre-order as soon as I heard about it. In the first set I received, the first 4 discs I watched were defective - stopping, skipping. I sent it back for a replacement. I'm now returning the replacement set after the first 2 DVDs I watched had the same problems, including grinding noise from the player. I will try one more time before asking for a refund. Perhaps the cracked glass artwork on the outside of the packaging was supposed to be a warning."
1,Defective DVD's,"I've been ordering from Amazon since they started. This is the first product I've ever returned. The buzzing, humming and vibrating occurs on several of the DVD's. I've asked for a replacement, but based on the other reviews, it seems I'll eventually be looking for a refund. It's a shame as I've been wanting many of the movies in the set. I'll keep my fingers crossed, but I'm not hopeful about this set.Addendum: I returned the Premiere Collection for a refund. I purchased the single copy versions of Rebecca, Spellbound and Notorious. Only Rebecca will not play in my DVD player. It plays without a problem in a friend's DVD player, so I will keep it for now. When I buy a new DVD player, I'll bring Rebecca along and try to find a player in which it will work. Alot of effort to simply watch one of my favorite movies, but well worth it."
5,Hitchcock Premiere Collection A+,"Absolutely fantastic movies. I have watch Lifeboat, Spellbound, Notorious, Sabotage, Young and Innocent and Rebecca, yet to view The Paradine Case. All movies have been clear in both picture and sound. The discs are easy to get out of their holder, it is like a half pocket. I just lifted the front of the pocket and with my other hand slipped the disc out, no resistence whatsoever. The only problem I had, sadly my plastic holder, which housed the discs in their special folder, was smashed in transit. There was no damage to my discs as they were well protected in the folder."
1,what???,"When i orderred this set i thought i was getting a great deal, 4 out of 8 films in the box set were unwatchable... come onnn they should recall this product, now i have to buy 4 film i already have."
1,Terrible disappointment on a long-awaited product,"After purchasing my second defective set of these DVDs, I am giving up because of the poor quality of the discs. The three movies that I most looked forward to- Rebecca, Notorious and Spellbound don't play at all, just make a loud grinding noise in the DVD player. I tried them in several DVD players, including my computer and none work. I am too annoyed to bother with the others and will just send the collection back. I did leave a message on Fox's customer service number (1-888-223-2FOX) and emailed MGM, for what it's worth. I hope they release these movies with a new format. This was such a disappointment."
1,defective as well,"I stopped checking after 6 discs because 3 wouldn't play. Unfortunately I ordered before seeing the reviews indicating a problem. I sent mine back for a refund, rather than taking another chance. Too bad since I really want this set, as any Hitchcock fan would. As to whether MGM will fix the issue, I am not holding my breath - I am still waiting for the original Outer Limits Season 2 to come out on non-defective discs. When that got repackaged, they still had the same defects. :-)"
3,"Technical issues aside, a great box set.","Content-wise, this box set is terrific. I watched all the discs before reading all the other reviews here. I guess I was lucky that my discs played, but I did notice that one or two of them were pretty loud inside the player. I agree with everyone else that ALL dvds need to be secured on studs or pegs -- NO MORE SLEEVES! This automatically damages the discs, and I don't know why some studios continue to release their product like this. Fortunately, none of my discs were damaged, but every time you remove and replace the discs in their original sleeves, you may run the risk of scuffing or scratching them. The set is not available as of this posting (11.24.2008), so maybe it has officially been recalled?"
4,Outstanding in Everyway But One,"The pictorial quality and extras of this Alfred Hitchcock set are outstanding. It's a joy to have pristine copies of THE LODGER, SABOTAGE and YOUNG AND INNOCENT, which are generally seen only on poor public domain copies. As has been stated over and over the problem is with the tight wrap around the booklet that holds the dics and contains very nice notes on each film. The shrink wrap is too tight and can cause damage to the enclosed dvds. MGM/Fox have now released the titles in this set as individual discs and I would recomend purchasing them that way. Other than the wrapping problem I love the set and the creative packaging. I would give this set a FIVE STAR rating if it were not for the packaging problem."
2,"Box set quality is bad - Notorious, Spellboundand Rebecca are available individually","I received this item today. I immediately noticed that the Rebecca CD has specks on it, raised, you can see and feel them. They are like glue. There are visible defects on the other CDs in the package. The CDs look like they are poor quality as compared to other CDs I have - music, software and other movies.I have not played any of the CDs yet. I plan to try the one with the raised specks first-- however, they are going back even if it plays correctly. There is no excuse for poor quality.UPDATEEveryone should know that Notorious, Rebecca, and Spellbound are now available individually. Do a search for them."
1,No subtitles? No closed captions? Too bad,No subtitles? No closed captions? Too bad.Thirty million Americans hard of hearing and this set is of no use.Pity!
1,Defective Discs,"Tried two sets, and both featured defective discs that wouldn't play. Amazon has been great about handling the issue, but MGM is going to have to step up and redo this set and pull the defective ones off the shelves."
1,Make pretty coasters,"I too purchased this defective set, since it was purchased over 30 days ago (from another site) they refused to refund/exchange my money. Called MGM at 1-888-223-2369 & spoke to a very rude phone rep, she almost hung up on me but I finally got a return address from her for Fox Consumer attn: David at 20102 South Vermont Ave. Torrance, CA 90502 and was told to expect 6-8 weeks for a reply. Please I beg of you DO NOT purchase this box set it should be recalled!!!"
1,Premierly Defective Collection,"MGM save us all the anxiety & frustration, please recall this defective dvd collection. First it took me 3 different shipments just to receive a non broken acrylic case that houses the dvds (from another website). Well after all that grief I mailed the box set to my mother for Christmas, she calls me up to tell me all the movies she's watched so far stop midway. I am so embarrassed & so should MGM. Oh yes the transfers are magnificent BUT so what if the movies peter out right before the climax!!"
1,A Waste of Money,"I'm going to keep this short. These films are excellent. This set is not. 6 of the 8 discs in my set had horrible defects, like so many other customers have reported. As much as I love the films in this set I would suggest to anyone that the best option is to AVOID purchasing it. MGM/Fox does not care about their customers. The fact that this release has never been recalled demonstrates that perfectly."
3,Item hard to review - excelence and disappointment!,"While this MGM box -- re-releasing 4 of the old CRITERION OOP discs plus 4 restored movies -- is the dream of any Hitchcockphile, it's a huge disappointment because some the discs are defective and unplayable. Seems to be a pressing issue caused by the lack of quality control. So, be careful. MGM deserves zero stars.Amazon, as usual, has offered the best and most trusted service. Five stars for Amazon."
1,Great Movies on Terrible DVDs--Don't Buy!,"Unlike the other Hitchcock collections I own (Masterpiece and Signature), the packaging on this set is terrible: the plastic/acrylic case cracked almost immediately without any real pressure (i.e., opening it should not cause the case to crack along an entire edge), and although the binder of DVD slip covers is nice-looking, it's not particularly practical in terms of preventing the discs from being scratched (and I'm really careful with this sort of thing). But the worst part of this product is that the DVDs do not play. We tried watching _Rebecca_, one of my favorites, only to find that the entire movie just skips and jumps and hesitates and then doesn't play at all. It's terribly frustrating! And it turns out it's not a one-disc problem; it's several discs. So don't bother with this collection; it's a waste of money, and it ruins the Hitchcock experience!"
1,NOT A TANK FOR GOLDFISH!,"Let me just start off by saying this tank is in NO way appropriate for goldfish. I's about 25 gallons to small! That said I purchased this fish for an elderly betta and didn't use the filter at all (it's a piece of junk anyway, seems like the manufacturer decided to throw in an ultra powerfull filter to make up for the gross lack of space a goldfish would have in this deathtrap). Long story short this tank is alright for a betta (minus filter) but since it is marketed for goldfish I give this 1 star."
1,"filter killed my fish, I think?","The filter blew and sucked my daughter's first little godfish all over the tank. The fish has been ""sleeping"" all day. I am off to buy a new fish. I will not be using the filter. The store I bought it from, ""Superpets"", yeah right, should warn people that new goldfish are not strong enough to handle the filter. The same staff, when asked for advice about getting the fish used to the water, said it was not necessary. I of course did not take thier advice."
2,The Baptist Tradition is far wider,"Dockery and George narrow the Baptist tradition to serve the interests of the fundamentalist machine which took over the Southern Baptist Convention 1979-1994. No one reading this volume will learn of such major Baptist theologians as William Newton Clarke (who wrote the first systematic theology from a liberal perspective in North America), Walter Rauschenbusch (theologian of the Social Gospel), such African-American worthies as Howard Thurman, Martin Luther King, Jr., J. Deotis Roberts, Hispanics like Orlando Costas or C. Rene Padilla, women like Martha Stearns Marshall (18th C. evangelist) or Anne Dutton (19th C. British Baptist theologian), etc. Even the conservative mainstream of Baptist life is narrowed between these covers so that progressive evangelical Baptists like Clark Pinnock or the late Stanley Grenz are ruled out. A more honest title would be ""Theologians in the Conservative Calvinist Strand of Baptist Tradition."""
3,Cute but not Perfect,"Absolutely adorable, but small for the size. Not good for walking around a lot, tough to clean. Go for it, but get a half size up."
5,Another Great CD!!!,"Another great CD from Time Life. I own all the Songs 4 Life collection and am working on the Songs 4 Worship. These CD's are well put together with great songs by talented artists. The songs flow smoothly and compliment each other. If you want to be uplifted, rejuventated, and energized - Here's a good way to do it!!"
1,elevator music,I prefer a style of worship that is a bit more lively and contemporary. I like many of the songs on this CD but I didn't like how they were performed on this CD.
2,For beginners only,"Beginners will pick up some basics, but people experienced in systems thinking or modelling will be dissapointed.This book is really just an introduction to a very constrained set of systems thinking ideas. For people who have not seen the ideas before, it is a very straight forward and readable introduction.However, for people who have already been introduced to these ideas, which includes anyone who has read any of Senge's books, this is 20 pages of ideas crammed into a 200 page book.I would expect that anyone who would seek books out on this topic is already too knowledgable to find it of any use. If you are unfamiliar with the topics, however, it is not a bad first read (though I would still recommend The Fifth Discipline instead)."
1,why I am ashamed of this book,"Althoug Ms. Hasan may have had the best intentions at heart when writing this book. a book should minimally live up to its title and this book, not only falls short in cover in content, but this book is going to undermine the efforts of those who are trying to educate the public on the religion without sacrificing scholarship or credibility. I am not clear why Asma is a Muslim any more then why she is not a person of any other religious persuasion. The merits of her faith are characteristic of so many other faiths. What makes her observations and reflections uniquely Islamic. I am embarressed for Muslims, for Asma and for her publisher. Liberated images of Muslim woman without credibility and scholarship attached to them will not counteract the negative images out there. IN fact its an insult to the intelligence of the reading public to think it would"
4,Everyone Should Read This Book with an Open Mind!!!,"I enjoyed reading this book and had a few good laughs along the way!!! It's nice to see that Asma has enough courage to voice her opinions in a time where most Muslim women would remain silent. I don't understand why there are so many negative views on this book. I found the book very easy to read, easy to understand, and it is pretty much as accurate as possible. I have two friends that have read it and they found it to be a good learning experience about American Muslims. Just remember the book's opinions are hers not everyone's. Take the book at face value, try to appreciate her opinions and try to learn something good from her book!!! I do recommend this book to those that are interested in what American Muslims go through on a daily basis."
1,Naive,"Bless her heart. If she thinks that Islam is respectful of women's right, let her try to practice law in the cradle of Islam, Saudi Arabia...."
1,Even all the positive reviews cannot save this book,I thought this book wasn't informing readers about Islam. It seems she allows Islam into her life when it suits her. Islam is a way of life not an accessory to it. The author fails miserably in convincing this reader of her sincerity and her knowledge of Islam.
2,Not Far Enough,"Ms. Hasan has tried to put a human face on Islam but,except for a few glowing reports, her own religious cohorts are unwilling to allow her to express any corralation between the ideals of a free and democratic society and Islam. One response to her post, someone from ""paradise"" aka India-insists that only Islam will bring the world to high place of ethics and morality. Will this be before or after we discuss the atrocities committed by the followers of Islam in India itself, the genocide in Armenia (1898-1915) or the palestistinian bus bombers of today.Ms.Hasan should be more honest and explain why Islam is unable to stop the abuse of honor killings,child labor and poverty in such places as the peoples paradise of India. Is it possible that Islam is a terribly flawed system of belief based upon a prophet who spoke of peace but never found it himself?"
1,waste of money,"I have written two reviews which have yet to appear.this is a test to see if my review will appear. Suffice it to say I DID NOT ENJOY this book, nor would i encourage anyone to waste thier time reading or reviewing for that matter. This is the third review , not to be published i suspect.."
4,I liked it.,"Overall, I think this was a great book. As a person who knows very little about Islam, it was a good way to get a brief history on this religion. I think it was well written, which made it easy to follow along despite the wealth of information found in there. I got the impression, though, that Asma was reaching to make connections at some points, especially in the chapter about how Islam is a woman's religion. I still am not fully convinced of that.I enjoyed learning about the Sufi ideologies, and I laughed when Asma talked about the ways people mispronounce her name, because I go through that all the time. Overall, it's a great book."
5,The Book to read on summer vacations,"Although the usually Muslim-bashing nominals love her non-threatening demeanor, that doesn't take away from the fact that Asma Hasan (herself) is operating independent of the psychosis-driven imitators that dominate all media; records, books, newspapers, and including much of the Internet culture.Asma is a kind of self-help-book writer who can say do-as-I-say because what she is saying is so universally true and free enough of polemics the reader can ""hear"" what she's really saying. While you read what she says enough space is left between the notes set alongside her bass lines, as a way of saying it, to ""hear"" what your own heart tells you. Now, there is a trustworthy voice! Who can be more trusted than one who has chosen goodness?What a Book I am Amazed!Valli khanWalnut CA"
4,thoughts on Ms. Hasan's new book,"I enjoyed reading this thoughtful and insightful book. It gives an American's perspective on Islam, and is narrated with an easy, conversational style. The author provides many personal anecdotes to illustrate her views on her religion. I recommend it to persons who desire to gain an appreciation for their Muslim neighbors, particularly if one is hesitant to approach the subject of religion in conversation with those neighbors."
2,Sincere attempt to portray Islam in the best possible light,"I am certain that every non-Muslim would welcome a Sufi brand of Islam especially during these times. But Sufism is not the mainstream Islam and it is not enough to say that this or that is not true Islam. Worse, she tries to whitewash and rationalize what we in the west consider as negative aspects of some practices done in the name of Islam. She displays a great deal of naivete invoking the ""Render unto Caesar.........."" line as applicable to Islam and stating that the concept of the separation of Church and State is a non-issue in Islam, completely ignoring the Sharia Law. This book brings more confusion to the non-Muslim world.I still believe that reforms in the Muslim world would have to come from the efforts of moderates like this author and others like Irshad Manji."
3,The cover tells it all,"Obviously, this book was intented, in part, as a rebuttal to Ibn Warraq's ""Why I Am not a Muslim"" which came out about ten years ago. Its cover shows a photograph of the author, young, attractive and smiling. By contrast, the dust jacket to Mr. Warraq's earlier book, contained no photograph -- unusual in the publishing industry, but quite understandable, given the death threats incurred by Salmon Rushdie, author of ""The Satanic Verses."" What does this tell you about Islam? Volumes."
5,Great Cartoons!,"Great book, funny Cartoons. Authors lean to the right on the political scale, but they also have Bush and his administration in the book. The authors are from the Ayn Rand school of objectivism. This ideal is found throughout their cartoons. I love the authors commentary on how the create and work on their cartoons. I highly recommend this book."
5,Cox and Forkum - Seeing it Clearly and Cleverly,"Simply put -- the most insightful and pleasing political cartoons made today. The artwork is as superb as the ideas.This book takes aim bad ideas of Republicans and Democrats alike. It puts America, Democracy and Freedom above all else. Any lover of liberty and common-sense will be nodding their head along with each cartoon. Islamists, anti-american and anti-semitic folks beware -- Cox and Forkum have you nailed.To sample some of their work before purchasing, check out coxandforkum.com"
2,Okay read but disorganized...,"This book had some good info and gave me a few items to research on my own. The book as a whole is disorganized, rambles continuously and is extremely repetitive saying the same thing several different times and ways. There is even one chapter that is repeated verbatim towards the end of the book.However, the price makes it worth the buy as the author does give a few good pieces of information that helped me expand my personal research."
3,"For low cal, it's decent.","Since Margaritas taste incredible but so are the calories, I decided to buy this to test it out. Granted, this will not make your Margarita taste even close to the ones you get at a bar, but at least you will like it. It's kind of strong, so a little amount can go a long way. Salud!"
5,Boys love this!,"My son loves this toy. Two of his cousins had this toy and he would play and play with it when he was younger (around 3 years old). There are two motorcycles that you latch into the toy and then push the handle to get them all revved up and then push the button and they race off. The only thing is that it's hard for kids to get the motorcycles latched in. Besides that, it's great."
4,In the Service of Samurai,"Ms. Oliver has a feel for making a story flow and build to an ending that you want to not come so quickly. The story starts mysteriously and then builds up with an eye on the layers of classes inherent in Japan of this era. Though listed as a ""Young Adult"", it was engaging and entertaining for most age groups. A gentle read that will acquaint a Western reader with a number of Eastern traditions. Try it."
4,I love this book,Good Morning Gorillas is one of my favorite Magic Tree House books. I love it. I love the book because it has lots of words and it's long. I always love long books. My favorite part of the book is when Jack & Annie get a twig from a Mountain Gorilla as their gift.
4,Good Mornig Gorillas,"Good Morning gorillasGood Morning Gorillas is by Mary Pope Osborne. In this magic tree house book, the main Characters are Jack and Annie is in the rain forest. This book is about jack and Annie meeting a little gorilla who leads them to his family and becoming close friends. What I think the author is saying is you can become friends with animals. I can't tell my favorite part because it's the end and I don't want to give away the ending. But even though it was sad I loved it. I think it would be a good book for people who love animals.-Michelle, 9"
4,Good Morning Gorillas,Gorillas in the Mountains of Africa!Good Morning Gorillas by Mary Pope Osborne is an adventurous animal fiction story. The two main characters are Jack who takes notes wherever he goes and Annie who is very adventurous in finding new friends and clues. Jack and Annie travel in the magic tree house to go to the jungle in the mountains of Africa. They are going to Africa to save gorillas from extinction. I liked this book because it is an exciting story about Jack and Annie's encounter with huge gorillas. It is a very brave and nice thing to save the gorillas because they are an endangered species. I recommend this book for all children ages nine and up. You can learn about gorillas and their suprising gentle nature. I give this book a rating of 4 out of 5.
5,Excellent,"The whole Magic Tree house series is a win-win. Not only is it really entertaining for my daughter, but she learns a lot each and every book.You cannot go wrong with this entire series."
3,Beck Arnley 180-0199 Electronic Ignition Module,"As with all auto electronic ignition system parts, it will either work or will not. In my case, it worked. Will it continue to function? Who knows, however, I'm confident it will. Thanks!"
5,Beautiful Bracelet,"I love this bracelet, but because my wrists are so very thin, I wear it pushed up my arm. It is very maleable, which is fine for ppl with normal to larger wrists, but I fear I will break it with much wear if I had to bend it to truly fit my tiny wrists as it is designed to do. It garners many compliments and can be worn casually or a bit more formally for either males or females."
5,A wonderful addition for your J2EE collection,"An excellent reference for J2EE programmers and architects. I really enjoyed the chapters on bad practices (ala anti-patterns) in J2EE. It's equally important to identify the ""bad smells"" in a design as it is to come up with a good design. Having the patterns organized by ""layers"" was very welcomed. The class and sequence diagrams are printed inline with the text. This is a nice amenity to the book; the design patterns published in the book were originally found on the JDC site in beta form and all the diagrams were scaled down in size. The only way to view them was to click on them and look at them in a new document view. This book will certainly be a mainstay on my desktop at consulting engagements. I just hope the J2EE community can get more of these types of books."
5,A Hands-on Patterns book - And a must read for J2EE Pros.,"Just one line - ""Excellent book - A well written Practical guide and Patterns library for all J2EE development"". A must-have in every Java pro library.I can't wait for the 'second edition', It looks like it is coming soon."
2,Not up to par,"As a reader of military fiction books, Thunder of Erebus let me down. First of all, I do have to admit that I like stories where the US whips ups on the bad guys and wins in the end, which is not the case here. But more importantly, the premise of the books is based upon a previously unknown super weapon that the Soviets have built and unleash on US forces. This is unrealistic and allows the author a convenient way of manipulating the plot.So in the end, despite some pretty good writing, it's the plot the let me down. If that is what matters to you, then you may want to pass on this book."
5,Great Home Theater System,"I finally took the plunge and bought a home theater speaker system - and what a great plunge it was. These speakers are not only very, very resonably priced but are super sounding speakers too. I never thought I could get this type of sound from a speaker system that sold for under $200.00. My big concern was how they would work with music. My concern vanished with the first song on the first CD that I played(Brothers In Arms by Dire Straits). WOW! The home theater reproduction was just as impressive, beginning with the THX intro in Last of the Mohicans and every part of the dvd thereafter. My only regret is that I waited so long before I made this decission. If you are looking for great home theater and CD music sound at a very fair price, please take a look at the Cerwin Vega AVS 5.1. - I think that you will be most pleased that you did."
3,Sounds great - service is not so good,"I purchased these speakers a couple months ago. Unfortunately it was a clearance sale so I could not return them. When they are working they sound great.I have had trouble with the sub. It requires a very high volume to kick in - then works at any volume as it should. When i called C-V they said it is a common problem and is very easy to fix - two capacitors or something. They referred me to their local service guys who 'fixed' it - but the problem still remains. I went back to C-V and they said not a problem - we'll send you a new amp asap. That was a month ago and my system is still in shambles waiting for the new amp.So, when the sub is working - the system really does sound great. Unfortunately you have to blast the system to get the woofer to kick in and it may go to sleep again if the movie has 20 minutes without a strong bass signal.Reccomendation: carefully test them when you get them home and make sure there are more in stock before you take one home."
2,Do Not Fit Properly,"I went on the CIPA website to find my truck model (2001 Dodge Dakota) which listed these as fitting my mirrors. I can get them on enough to stay put but it is a bit of a struggle and the bottom edge isn't fully attached to the mirror. I would have returned them and got a different set of mirrors, but upon further research I could not any other solid fitting mirrors like these that would be compatible with my vehicle. So I'm making due with these."
2,"Fit ok, didn't look great to me.","The mirrors seemed to fit ok, but I just didn't like the look of them. I also don't think they gave any added side view. I returned them."
2,extended mirrors,"Cheap item,does not tighten down on either sides, wobbles when at highway speeds, accurate viewing becomes difficult, would not recommend this item. Easily slides off the orginal mirrors."
2,Just barly adiquit.,"Quality is good. they mount on good enought. But they only add about 3 or 4 inches to the original mirrors. The mirror is also so small that I can hardly see with them. they are barly wider than my camper. If you only need your mirrors out a little bit more and you dont tow very often, these may do it for you. If I end up needing towing mirrors more than about 6 times a year, Im going to have to go a different route."
2,Do not buy if you have a Dakota,"These mirrors do not fit the typical stock mirrors for a 2003 Dodge Dakota. I called the company and they told me that I did not have the typical stock mirrors, I have the ""sport mirrors."" If you have this year Dakota, you have the ""sport mirrors."" I have never seen one of that series of Dakota's with the 6""x9"" mirrors that they talk about, and my dealership even said that they did not have any replacement mirrors of that size for my truck, only the 5""x7"" mirrors. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because if you do have a vehicle that these fit on, they work great!"
1,I do not recommend it,"I bought the EZ-lugnut to install my winter tires. I read the instructions and I proceed to remove the nut lugs, the first lug was removed fine, when I tried to remove the second one, the wrench snapped in half."
1,Poor Design,This product has many parts that are too light weight or thin to work properly. The first time i tryed to use the gear wrench the socket that fit over the lug nut to hold the torque bent and slipped off the lug nut. The wrench did not loosen the lug nut before slipping off.
1,Good idea - cheap design,"The first time I used the wrench, the aluminum casing cracked in half. It appears that it cannot take extreme pressure when trying to loosen a very tight lugnut. This problem had been reported by other users as well. I received the wrench as a gift and tried to get the company (WWT Group)to replace it under warranty. They said No receipt, no replacement! This is an expensive tool, but cheaply made and is not backed up by the manufacturer/supplier."
3,If I had found this first...,"But I didn't find it first so I bought a breaker bar (long handled 1/2"" socket wrench - does not ratchet). There are plenty for under twenty bucks but mine was under fifteen bucks. A good idea added to a small twenty dollar compressor. Who really wants to change a tire if you don't have to. Just get it to a tire store."
2,The Terrible Wave (the Terrible Book),"The Terrible Wave, in my opinion, was too fast-paced and didn'tinclude characters' feelings enough. While the subject was interesting, it did not include the characters' deeper thoughtsthat would have made this subject even more interesting -- tocapture the fear that happened during such a traumatic time."
2,Booo! This is the best book to put me to sleep!,"Hi I am a 10 year old girl and I had to read this book for class and I hated it! Yah it does give alot of detail and historical facts but it is boring. This book is about a girl named Megan who has a father that owns the biggest department store in Johnstown and her trip through her tough times in the Johnstown Flood with the new friends that she has made. Whopie Doo! Now, I am a person that likes mostly funny books but I do like historical books. It is not a book that you would get into then something really bad happens and you jump. No, when something really bad happens I go, Oh...Ok...Whatever. So if you want a good book to read, do not pick this one up."
3,Pretty plate,"This is one of those rare occasions where the picture actually looks better than the item. This plate is pretty and looks okay in my display case, but there certainly was inflation on this being worth $50 to start with. I paid $15, and it's about worth that, certainly no more, even with the super saver shipping. If I had to do this over again, it's about 50-50 whether I would."
1,should not be in print,"I have been fascinated by this case for a long time and had heard this book carried a very detailed account. It does indeed... but way too detailed if you ask me. There are gruesome descriptions of the crimes - which I assume were provided by someone who saw the videos seized from the house - and frankly, it made me sick to my stomach. I can not imagine how the victims' parents must feel knowing that the details of their daughters' torture and ultimately murder are now in print. I do not believe this should have EVER been allowed to be read by the public. I stopped reading the book halfway through and threw it in the rubbish."
4,Informative and Concise,"This book is a very helpful guide for helping to separate the fake items from the real ones out there. The hundreds of pictures included in the book wonderfully illustrate the points made in the text. The ""Miscellaneous Regalia"" section could have been larger and more inclusive but what is included gives good examples of how far people will go to forge items, especially written documents. The book should be very helpful to anyone who purchases it and will be indespensible for the beginning collector."
1,Book on Detecting the Fake German Medals...,"This book has good information; But, It lacks the way to show the Fakes. The photos should be in colour and the Fakes should not be only the blurry cast ones. There are excellent reproductions that can pass as originals...But, the only way to detect them are they are smaller in size.I do not find this book ""Detecting the Fakes"" a very Good book to really show, what to find in detecting Fakes. There are even foreign countries that are selling loads of fakes. Trying to claim that they were left behind by the Germans that had invaded their country.I only found in the book explainations that would give you an idea of what to find in fakes. But, the photos and examples were extremely unacceptable."
2,I have no idea why you all like this crap,"I've read reviews stating that this is some lyrical genius and touching. I personally think it's juvenile and shallow. I think the music additions in the background is unique and doesn't have the drum machine feel to it, but that's where the pleasure ends. The lyrics don't seem to go together in the songs - they just rhyme. I wouldn't listen to this driving down the road or sitting with my sweetie. I expect more from vocalists I guess..."
5,Best of the books--for me,"I am glad I purchased this. Like the approach and the writing. My favorite, even over the ""Dummies"" book."
3,Not enough Miles,"This is a good DVD. Production is great. Especially the 24 bit sound. The band is tight. It is enjoyable. However, it is not Miles Davis that is highlighted. Miles seems a little weak here. Solos are short and he seems intent on featuring other band members. I give it three stars because I would have liked more Miles. The Miles that you do get are good Miles.Other weaknesses...The bassist is a bit sloppy. On fast runs and solos notes are missing or very weak.Miles talks frequently throughout the concert into his trumpet's micrphone. However, it is tuned or turned down so low that you cannot hear what he is saying. Granted he is probably just introducing band members but still...this is lousy production or recording work.In summary if you want to see Miles playing the OBX and leading a great band this is a good DVD for you to buy. If you want hard-core trumpet playing pass on this one.Good pointsTight bandExcellent percussionVideo is excellent qualitySound is excellent quality"
4,Miles is Electric...,"I'm positive this wasn't his greatest concert in the electric days, but it is very good. Bottomline, you won't be wasting your money if you buy this. And you'll want to show it to other people. Especially Joseph McCreary, ""what the heck is a lead bass"". It looks and sound like a Jackson electric guitar. Very Cool. Buy you won't regret it."
5,"Low gloss, low stick","This stuff is sort of egg shell in glossiness, so has a bit of sheen but not much. It has just the right amount of stickiness for gaffers tape so you won't pull off paint or gold leaf (no warranties) from the priceless sculpture that your gaffer used to hold up your lighting cables."
5,Wonder tape...,"Holds down cords on carpet, plus doesn't leave a sticky residue on the carpet. This is so easy to apply!"
4,worth the money,I bought this grinder to remove a layer of epoxy from my garage floor. The epoxy is harder than concrete and other grinder that I use did not do the job and too much dust. This grinder with the diamond disc works well and fast. I connect a big vacuum from Home Depot and managed to remove all the dust. The force of the vacuum suck the grinder to the floor and I do not have to use any effort but just guide the grinder along.The only problem is the connector to the vacuum hose. The conncetor that I bought with this grinder do not fit the one that comes with the grinder and also the other end do not fit into the vacuum host. So I taped it together with duct tape but frequently the tape came off and dust flies. I wish Bosch can make a better connector that can locked together and would not disconnect.
2,Defective product.,"I've been very impressed with the Bosch tools I've been using. The quality is excellent and the price is reasonable. I had high hopes for this grinder, but unfortunately, it overheated in the first minute of usage. The handle became so hot that I couldn't comfortably hold it. Turned it off, packed it back up and returned it.On the plus side, it's a very well-built and sturdy tool, It feels powerful and substantial in the hand. I found that the button to push to lock the wheel in place for installing or removing the grinding wheels was awkward to use. The case is very well built and has places to put the accessories (wrench, vacuum hose adapter, documentation, and two holders for grinding cups). It comes with one grinding cup as standard.A defective item can happen to any company. This was clearly an unusual occurrence and I wouldn't hold it against Bosch. As I've said, all their other tools that I've used have been excellent. This was just a disappointment."
5,Amazing!,"I've been trying to get carpet glue off my basement floor for months. I've tried numerous smelly chemicals, but none of them completely removed the glue. I was about to give up until I found this grinder on amazon.com. One word- AMAZING! It may take longer grinding the concrete, but no more wasting money on smelly, harmful chemicals! The the 20 year old concrete looks brand new. Now, I can finally acid stain the concrete basement floor. I have taken the recommendations of other reviewers and bought a filter bag for my shopvac. I have not had a problem with dust at all."
3,Grinder,The grinder itself seems to work pretty well. Just make sure you have some type of vacuum hooked up to the port; it generates alot of dust. I was a little disappointed in the actual grinding wheel that came with the unit. It only lasted for about 65 sq.ft. of grinding. Replacement wheels can be found on line for about $120.
4,Christmas Gift,"Seller shipped quickly. Toy was in excellent condition. Excellent price...much better than what the stores offered at the time. Bought as a Christmas gift for my nephew, so I am uncertain as to the performance and such from use."
4,super mario goes hardcore... sort of,"haha, silliness. but refreshing. some of the hardcore elements are too familiar but they break the mold with their obvious love affair with low-tech synth. this will be every hardcore geek's favorite band, until the imitators follow. then it will be up to HORSE to ditch the hardcore for metal or perhaps industrial? we'll see. his vocals are terrible, but in a good way. no excess cheese like you would get from a band like trivium. maybe for fans of BTBAM, Giles, Poison the Well, MELVINS, Cornelius, Thrice, Fantomas, Dillinger Escape Plan, Aphex Twin, deftones, Tricky, Thursday... i dunno. they're kinda weird"
3,More or Less,"Out of the 13 tracks, 10 are quite amazing, but three seemed forgettable. The album kept shifting between really ingeneous sections and lame predictable riffs. As a whole, the Album doesn't seem as memorable or new as their earlier work, but there are definatley some songs on the CD that stand out, such as ""Taken by Vultures"", ""Birdo"", and ""Soaring Quails"".If you are already a fan of Horse the Band, give this album a try. It is on this album that the band really emphasizes their metal influences, and polishes their songwriting a bit. Otherwise, if you are new to the band, try getting R. Borlax or something else. ""The Mechanical Hand"" just doesn't have the consistency nor the comprehensivness that is displayed on that album, and thus, does not serve as a good introduction to their work."
2,Combat Resurects with This?!,"Horse the Band is metalcore at its utmost irritating, lame riffs but at the same time attempting to be different by including twinkly, videogame inspired keyboard passages. While not entirely worthless, the vocals get in the way of some decent riffs. Not worth the purchase."
4,very very good,"this album is like an upgraded version of R Borlax. More technical, better songs, more breakdowns, etc. No cutsman here, but still a fine albumget ityou wont be disappointedthey havent sold out to ""the man""(yet)"
5,AMAZING!,"I have all of Horse The Band's demos, and I own R. Borlax. This album is a technical masterpiece. I love every second. With quick synth intermingling rather than following the guitars, this is how music should be! I myself am in a hardcore band and play synth and I love Horse The Band's style and they inspire me in so many ways!"
1,Don't waste your money,I was passed a free copy of CD and it's not worth the sum of the materal it took to press it. This guy just can't sing! There are sound clips on CDBaby that you should check out that will prove it. This is just a CD project by an amature has-never-been and never will be. How does stuff like this end up on Amazon?
2,Take getting use to,"It took over a month to get use to it, after the first couple of tries I decided I would never use it again, but after seeing too much hair on my face, I went ahead and give it another try. This time I put it on low try it on my arms, I prefer this feeling then I tried it on my face and was successful getting most of the hair out. Its not 100% efficient but helpful and I think using this and Vaniqa seems to reduce the unwanted hair somewhat."
3,SHORT LIFE BUT HAPPY WHILE IT LASTS,"For the thin-skinned among us an epilator is manna from heaven. This is my fourth epilator and it's good and reliable. Why have I had four? Because they're presumed to be COMPLETELY IRREPARABLE (even by Emjoi)--no questions asked. For that reason, they should come with a warning label. BUT--if razors and depilatories take off as much skin as hair and you can't indulge in laser hair removal--they're the only game in town. I'll buy a fifth when I have to."
3,It's just ok,This product is just ok. It does not work nearly as well as the Remington (best I have used) or Epilady (circa 1989!) that I have purchased in the past. Doesn't grab hair very well so I have to make many more passes before it gets them. I thought that the two heads that allow bi-directional passes would be worth the extra cost but it wasn't.
2,Not for stubborn/coarse hairs....gave me razor bumps!,"Not only did this product give me razor bumps on my chin area (I'm a girl by the way), it also had problems removing stubborn hairs. The actual hair removal process wasn't that painful but I was not pleased with the results. I returned this product and got the Braun 5270 Epilator instead."
1,Not good,This product does not work as advertised. With sensitive skin in leaves red markswhere hair is removed. On legs it does not remove hair. Only makes it shorter.Save your money. I would send it back if it wasn't too late. My face is a mess.
4,Sixteen Very Good Mysteries,"Barbara D'Amato, Sue Henry, Jill Churchill, and Alan Russell are a few of the authors in this collection of mysteries. The stories are short and there is information about each author and the books they've written at the end of each story. I think the Malice Domestic series offers the best story selection of any of the anthologies I've read"
3,Like it so far.,"This is a really nice looking piece to my central vacuum. There are many things I like about it. Very easy on, off when detaching the hose for around the room deeper clean. Easy on off button that does not get in your way as you work. The floor up and down button is very easy to use and the on off button that is parallel to that both our a tap of the foot. The tubing is strong and I like it covered. I will be updating this review and I have to clean things out or as things break. I have only had this for a couple months and have been happy so far."
1,"Don't bother, stick with paper","Have you heard the joke, popular in Maine, where the lost tourist asks the rural resident how to get to a popular landmark, and the old codger replies, ""well, you can't get there from here""! That is what this software tells me every time I try to use it. Not only does it make wildly inaccurate and completely baffling guesses at the addresses I enter (MapBlast or MapQuest come up with the right option every time), this software seems incapable of joining the dots I do get entered. I live outside of Philly, and these are major roads. I fear for those who might rely on this junk in a rural area. Until I can afford a fancy GPS unit for my car, this CD that I bought with this crapola software on it will be used to mark pages in my ever reliable road atlas. Thanks for nothing, Rand McNally!"
1,Yet another ugly mapping program,"What is wrong with these people? Three million travelers have Powerbooks and they can't be bothered to compile this program for any other operating system but Windows? Now that the Mac OS and Linux are Unix based, this is a simple process and I can't believe this company doesn't want this business.I tried this program on a PC - it doesn't work correctly on XP (crashed) and I think it is one of the ugliest interfaces I have seen. I didn't try the GPS feature. I do appreciate the Palm additions and the newer, more current map information, but it doesn't make me want to recommend it."
3,Used for years,I have used Trip Maker for three years and am considering up-grading to the 2003 version. I have found it interesting and easy to use. My wife and Kids have fun with it when traveling and using the GPS.
1,This product is a major [joke],... The street data is at least 5 years behind any decent atlas such as Delorme and there are many errors including streets that don't connect to other streets. Stay away from this one!
1,Tripmaker is bugridden,"TripMaker is so buggy that I would be reluctant to buy any Rand McNally product again. I bought it very cheaply at Costco -- I do not care about the money -- it is the lack of quality that bothers me.There were several error messages during the install process, and the program hangs whenever I try to input a date. In addition, its routing and street level detail is primitive, to be kind."
1,I'd give it less stars if I had the option,"I was so very disappointed with this program. I regularly use Rand McNally's website to get directions. I thought that buying this program would get me away from having to do that while I was on the road. WRONG!!! You need an Internet connection to use the software. I'm STILL looking on the box to see where it might tell a consumer that BEFORE they bought it. I'm out $...and have a useless piece of software that I cannot use. If you need to use a streetfinder program while on the road, this is NOT for you."
1,Difficult to use,"I have attempted to use this product many time for trips and it is at best difficult to use. It frequently locks up when calculating the route or accessing trip sense. The fact that it chooses ridiculous routes is not unusual for map software, but again attempts to tweak the route by using the ""prefer segment"" feature often doesn't work or locks up.The PDA downloads are virtually worthless.It is difficult to use Streetfinder also in that when in high zoom, many streets are not indicated by their state of federal route numbers.My opinion is stay away from this product."
1,Prompt refund.,Cannot rate the item because the computer program did not work on my computer. A refund was promptly given to me when I contacted the seller.
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I am so frustrated about having this program I felt I needed to write a review to warn potential buyers.I've used 3 softwares: Garmins' MapSource USA, AAA/Delorme's Map & Go 4.0 (1998). This is by far the WORST program.Looks good with nice package and appealing interface, but works poorly.1. It's very slow - takes a long time to load and refresh. For each zoom in/out action, it takes about 2 to 3 seconds to refresh. I use a P4 top of line laptop by the way and have the whole program installed on my harddisk.2. The TripMaker has lots of fancy functions like expense tracking, daily schedule etc. It's all too cumbersome to use and impractical.3. GPS function does not provide voice commands (ie PC tell you which direction to go).I intended to replace my 1998 version of Delorme's Map&Go from AAA with this program. But the former is still much more superior than this!"
1,Poor,"Kauai Underground Guide may have gone through 18 editions, but it has lost its way. I will share a few examples: (1)phone #s do not include area code 808 as if travelers call from their hotel room (ancient history in the era of mobile phones), (2) maps are referred to by number (1-8) but not by PAGE numbers, so they are impossible to find (3)the telephone # for the Hyatt is 742-1234, not 724-1234, (4) Restaurants are all mixed up - eastside ""best bets"" are not listed with eastside restaurants but appear at random on page 31, (5) maps with hotels are under ""beaches"",(6) the index needs to add and numerous listings, including, among others, map pages and movies-made-in-Kauai (which are tacked on at the end of ""Eastside Restaurants""). It is impossible to find/return to places in the book. The book needs serious updating, editing, and organizing."
3,Buy Kauai Revealed!,The Underground Guide is not nearly as detailed as Kauai Revealed. It contains more warnings about what NOT to do and where NOT to go than it does helpful advice. It seems to be written by locals who want to keep tourists away from places other than shopping centers and restaurants. Save your money and buy Kauai Revealed instead.
5,Grrrreat!!,This book has the most information on Kauai that I have seen. Anyone traveling with kids this book is a must. Things to do and places to stay........this book has grreat stuff. I reccomend it to anyone going to Kauai.Barbara
5,Great Book To Save Time And Money While In Kauai,"My wife and I loved using this during our trip to Kauai. It has great restaurant, hotel, and activity reviews and helps save time when planning your daily adventures around the island."
5,The Best Kauai Guide !,I just purchased my third copy of this book as there is none better written about Kauai! Lenore Horowitz goes out of her way to explore every aspect of this beautiful island and then to relay it in such an interesting and insightful fashion. I keep the book with me while in Kauai and use it as my only reference guide - what to do/where to go at the drop of a hat. It is a MUST for anyone going to Kauai.
5,Best guidebook for families visiting Kauai,"Went to Kauai last year with kids. For families, this is definitely the best Kauai guidebook. It is very oriented to what both parents and children would like in terms of sights, beaches and restaurants. I also like that she ""dares"" to suggest that people on a limited budget might prefer a boat ride along the Na Pali coast instead of a helicopter ride. Having done both, I agree the boat ride was way more pure fun than the heliocpter, where the kids had a front seat view and Mom was squished in the back. Also found her restaurant recommendations more accurate than ohter guidebooks e.g. the Ultimate Kauai Guide. The only thing I would like to see added to the book would be more hotel/ condo reviews."
5,See it like a native!,"Would you like to go to a beach where you can drive for miles and miles and see no one at all? Do you want to go have noodle saimin for cheap that is world-class (the locals go there)? The author obviously knows her stuff. We did over a dozen of the suggested activities, and quickly figured out to follow her food recommendations, and we were delighted. In general, what we got was the ""real"" experience, not one that had been plasticized for tourists. If you like to travel in a way where you can appeal to your sense of exploration and cultural immersion, this guide is a no-brainer. Thank you so much for enriching our month in Hawaii!!"
5,personal opinions with photos and maps to direct your travel,"This guide book reviews only the places the author has experienced first hand. That honest appraisal means if you are dining at a place in which she only had breakfast, you won't know exactly what to expect but you understand that up front. Her children's likes and dislikes gives you the viewpoint of different age groups and interests. The maps were especially helpful as we used the guide constantly on a recent trip to Kauai. It was required to be in the car whenever we went exploring for it's directions to beaches, activities, and local advice. When we drove by a small, nondescript fish market (G's) we were looking for fresh fish. We quickly looked it up in the guide. It proved to be delicious, fresh and served by a very friendly owner as the Guide promised. We would never have discovered dozens of delights without the help of the Kauai Underground Guide."
5,Kauai Underground Guide- DO NOT LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT!!!,"I bought this book after I saw it reviewed in the Honolulu Advertiser, which said the book was ""thorough, up to date--a mature, trusted sidekick for the visitor who wants to get to know the island well""--Honolulu Advertiser August, 1998. I could not agree more! The detailed beach and resturant descriptions were invaluable! It's really well researched and is obviously the product of years of family visits to Kauai. As a bonus- the music CD is great and helps to fund important children's charities on the island."
2,Disappointing: Cumbersome navigation on Kindle edition,"The book makes extensive internal references by page number, but on the Kindle edition, there is no way to jump to a PAGE, it's all by ""Location"" (huh?) The index is a list of terms in alphabetical order with NO LINKS (and no page numbers or ""Location""numbers) ie a USELESS INDEX on Kindle!"
2,CD was O.K.,"Not enough information on how to do any activities on your own. Too many ""Guided tours""."
2,Travlin' Man,Purchased this guide and the Kauai Revealed for an upcoming trip to the islands. Revealed is far and away a much more informative and seemingly provides unbiased assessments. Unlike most guide books it actually makes for interesting reading. Kauai Underground does not provide indepth enough descriptions and/or directions to sights. I gave the Underground 2 stars only because it came with the CD of Hawaiian music which I did find enjoyable.
5,Great to do business with,The seller sent the book quickly and the book was in good condition as described.
1,Poor guidebook,"While I applaud the authors for donating the profits from the book to children on Kauai, I'm sorry to say it is a very poor guidebook. I puchased this book and the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook, and the UKG is so much better. The Kauai Underground Guide is poorly organized and doesn't contain any ""underground"" informaiton. The UKG has MUCH more ""underground"" information and is much better organized with MUCH better maps. Furthermore, I want a guidebook that is opinionated. I want a guidebook to say things like ""don't waste your time"" or ""this is definitely the best,"" and this book doesn't do that. When you read through the book, you get the annoying feeling of reading someone's travel memoirs. The authors get annoyingly ""poetic"" with their descriptions, and you almost feel like you're reading advertisements. I'm sorry to say, don't waste your money on this book, go for the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook -- it has everything you'll need."
2,Definitely not what I expected.,Maybe it is the format I am not satisfied with. This is the first Kindle edition guide book I have purchased and was expecting to find it easy to navigate through and it was not. I will buy my next guide book in paperback form.
3,Kauai,I like it so far but where does the cd hawaiian music come it at? Is it at the end of the book?
3,quick service but details misleading,I received this book quickly in the mail but was also expecting it to come with an audio CD. I was very disappointed that the CD was missing and that the detail information describing the condition of the book did not mention this important fact.
2,In need of an overhaul,"I didn't think this book lived up to its reputation. Not enough in the adventure department, too much emphasis on where to eat and shop. I had a hard time negotiating the way it was organized and felt much of the information needed revising. The cover promised more than the book could deliver."
3,"This book is OK, but it needs better directions",I thought this book was Ok. I bought the latest version and did get to see some great stuff that I would not have found on my own. The directions to attractions and local events were very confusing and sometimes just outright wrong. All in all it was an OK guide. The free cd was great!!
3,Mostly a reference to other sources.,If you purchase this book to find information about things to do or places to go in Kauai then be prepared to use it as a source to find information somewhere else. My impression is that it is a compilation of other sources of information. It is a helpful book but I was disappointed. I'm thankful that my wife usually does most of the research on places we travel to. She found the book useful and said she would give it 4 stars.
3,Good reference but not as comprehensive as other guides,Very personal view of Kauai and what her family enjoys on Kauai. Beaches are very well described in detail and comprehensive....other aspects of island and activities with recommendatiomns on which ones are best is NOT given in book. Pictures are great and it is a quick read but needs to be complimented with another guide such as Kauai Revealed or Discover Kauai by Lonely Planet
1,Waste of money,"I've bought several books in preparation for our trip. This was the least helpful. It felt like a very general overview of the island and as they bragged about all their bigwig friends it became clear they were just promoting their buddies' businesses. I think they've lived in the islands too long and the agenda is no longer to help visitors, but to protect their interests and steer the tourist into specific, controlled activities. The maps were poorly done. I wish I had saved this money. If you just want to stay on the basic path with general and expensive tourist trap restaurants and activities - and don't want to read much - this could be a simple way to get basic info. Not what I wanted."
3,"Great for beachgoers, lacking in ""underground"" items.","I would first like to say that this book has some interesting notes about the history of Kauai. That is fine if you want to take the time to read them. I really feel that this book is good for families traveling with children. The book focuses mainly on beaches and dining. I did not see any indication of any of the items normally referred to as ""Underground"" which was disappointing. The information about various dining establishments was very helpful. The maps are nice but do not include mile markers. If added, these would increase the value of these colorful maps. Overall, I would rate this book as fair"
4,inside info,"We were referred to this book by the people from whom we rented our condo in Hawaii. We found it very informative and family oriented. We purchased another book at the same time which we found was better suited to our active, no children life style: Kauai Revealed. We would recommend buying both. They complement each other nicely.In addition, we really enjoyed the free music CD. We have many CDs of Hawaiian music and this is a nice supplement.One word of warning though, after you read the book, you will be ready to jump on a plane right this moment! Alooooha!!"
5,Definitely worthwhile reading,"Lenore Horowitz does a superb job of explaining in detail the best locations on Kauai. We used it continually as a reference while traveling there with two small children. Her recommendations on beaches were especially insightful...coming from the midwest, beach information is a must. It is obvious that this book was written by someone who knows the island well and didnt just visit it once and decide to write a guidebook. Kauai has been her family vacation destination for years. Thanks Lenore..."
3,Download worked fine with XP,"I had no trouble using the program and doing the download.I didn't really like the way he said my son's name.The Toys R Us had several remaining Poohs, but they had no Elmos or Doras left"
1,POOH DOESN'T SAY MY SON'S NAME RIGHT,"I WAS IN TOYS R US TODAY AND SAW A DISPLAY FOR THESE DOLLS. U CAN PROGRAM THE DISPLAY TO SAMPLE HOW YOUR CHILD'S NAME WOULD SOUND IF U PURCHASED ONE OF THESE DOLLS (ELMO, DORA, OR POOH) MY SON'S NAME IS DOMENIC BUT WINNIE THE POOH SAID DOMENIC FUNNY, DORA DIDN'T SOUND LIKE IT AT ALL!!!! BUT THE ELMO ONE SAYS HIS NAME PERFECT. I WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING THE DISPLAY IN THE STORE FOR YOUR CHILD'S NAME BEFORE PURCHASING ONE OF THESE JUST TO MAKE SURE."
3,Download problems also,"I purchased both the Pooh and Dora Knows Your Name for my children. I had no problems with the Dora download, but I could not get the Pooh download to work. After reading the other reviews, I tried to download Pooh from my laptop and it worked immediately. So, I definitely agree with the others... if you can't get the download to work from one computer, you will probably have success with a different computer. I just wish I had read the reviews sooner so I wouldn't have wasted so much time changing batteries, reinstalling software, trying other USB ports, etc.! Other than the problems with the download, I think my son will greatly enjoy this toy."
5,DOES work with Windows XP,"Yes, you do get a warning from Windows that it is not 'Windows Logo Tested' and MAY make your OS unstable but you can still continue to install the software. If you see the review of the DORA knows your name another customer called Mattell and they said that it was fine to go ahead and install. For the record I have seen this warning many times installing various programs. I have Windows XP SP2 and did not have any problems. So again go ahead and install it, it will work just fine."
2,Don't waste your money.......,"Don't waste your money on this Pooh. My son got him for Christmas and didn't really care anything about him. I know that you can change the songs but our Pooh says Happy Birthday to my son every day. I probably can change that, though. He doesn't keep the time. Every day he got more and more off until he was singing and talking in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT and AT NAP TIME! Well, needless to say, he he is no longer with us! He lives in the garage. My husband put him out there after he woke my son up, AGAIN! I will be storing him in the attic soon. I wouldn't recommend for anyone to purchase him. He says my son's name really funny too. I was extremely disappointed with this."
5,Metal is Good!,My son was needing a better mouthpiece to brighten his tone and increase his volume (even though he already had plenty of volume to begin with). This mouthpiece fit the bill just fine for him. He loves it!
4,I liked this book,I enjoyed this book alot it some lol (laugh out loud) moments but the start of the realtionship with Tim and Suzanna made this book only 4 stars instead of 5 I mean he took her to Vegas to get married she should of known something was up but don't worry everything turns out great in the end and I really enjoyed the rest of the book. I plan on passing this around to my friends who love to read fun romance novelsI recommand Love To Love You Baby
2,Not my thing,"Perhaps I haven't given the album the chance it deserves, but it comes across as something of a rap/rock mess...however, Poison Well is really a great song, and I have a feeling that this band - if they get a tighter sound, will make big noise in the future."
1,Where have I heard this before?,"Let me see, hmmm....P.O.D? Limp Bizkit? Papa Roach? Korn? (Hed) P.E.? The list is endless. Insolence's major-label debut is full of the same rap-metal cliche - angst-ridden lyrics, down-tuned guitars, etc. There's is absolutely nothing original on this album. Nothing. If you're into rap-metal, then you'll probably like this, but if not, don't buy it. It's plain and simple."
4,Rapsore may live on!,"Well it seems the rapcore movement has not stopped or slowed down. While popular ""mainstream"" metal bands burn up the charts, many rapcore cd's seem to be dismissed just because of the genre. This is not a cd to dissmiss. Sounding like a cross between Sublime, P.O.D. and the Deftones, Insolence is a gem that must be given a chance. Songs that stand out are ""Poison Well"", ""Game Over"", and ""Death Threat""."
5,Works great,I bought this as a replacement for one that I have had so long it's worn out. They work great!
5,Great Grooming Tool,My wife loved this device. Does a neat job with minimum effort. Liked it so much that we ordered another one for a senior friend; well received.
3,Just okay,"As far as hair removal goes, the Tweeze Tweezer is okay. It's good for the money but is just as painful as removing hair with tweezers. The difference is that your tweezing more hair at a time than individual plucking. Not sure if that's good or bad. Was aware that it would be somewhat painful but the loud sound of such a compact item kinda made me uneasy before I even started hair removal. Didn't seem to remove all hair but it may have been my technique -sound plus pain made me hesitant to touch the Tweeze to my skin (upper lip only area I tried). Worth a try, but as much as I hate tweezing and lotion depilatories, I will probably stick with either (or both) of those."
3,Does a fairly good job,This product is useful for hair above the lips but has to be use almost every day. Sometimes problems with in-grown hairs from use.
2,It hurts a lot,"Even though the price of this product is less, the quality is bad. It hurts a lot and it doesn't remove the hair completely. It's not meant for removing hair from face. I would rather buy an expensive one than waste money on this. After all you are spending on your skin!!I gave two star for its price only!!"
4,Tweeze...,"It works great on fine hair, very happy with that. But, not so great with any that are a bit more coarse."
3,Emjoi Tweeze,"Item's good for the price it is. Great for fine ""chin hairs"" but not so good for those ""over 60"" little stubborn white hairs."
1,Broke after 3 Months,This thing worked for the first 3 months. It got all the hairs after going past once or twice but it only works in one direction ie. going left to right. Anyways one day it just stopped. I tried new batteries and everything. What a waste! Will not buy again.
3,Works well for the price,"This product works very well for fine hairs and ok for more coarse hairs. You do have to tweeze a few hairs, but you can't expect miracles from it. It didn't hurt as bad as people say it did. No more than waxing. For the price, it was worth it to me."
3,Ouch! But the model in the photo looks so serene...,"I have mixed feelings about this product. I've used it for at least two years, but mostly because I haven't found anything better. It hurts like heck, especially in the upper lip area. Tears literally fall out of my eyes when I try to tackle this area, so I shave that part instead. I use this for the hair on my chin and along the jaw line.Some hair is plucked from the root, while other hair is simply broken off. I have red bumps all over the area where I use it and it's a full time job dealing with these breakouts. However, if I don't remove the hair, the condition improves, but then I'm hairy again. As a woman, I found it's better to have acne than facial hair. I wish the hair would just go away so that I could leave my face alone and enjoy having nice skin. Until then, I'll be using my Emjoi tweezer."
2,waste of money,it will work but so do you. you have to have it dead on the hair to be removed for the process to be correct. my trusty tweezer works better. good luck.
2,Not quite what I expected,"This product gets the baby-fine hairs just great but the whiskery ones takes a lot of work. I find I have to use this device daily to keep on top of new growth. I do not think it will replace my waxing. Overall, this may be fine for some people but for people who have the whiskery hair growth, probably will not work to it's advertised potential. I would be reluctant to try it on my underarms or bikini area."
2,not great,"This product is great for fine hairs. This product doesn't work on the coarse, thick hairs that some women get on their chin. The buyer should also be careful. I read the package insert first and then used it on my chin. I lost the top layer of skin on a small patch of my chin. I was trying to get the coarse hairs out. They didn't come out, but my skin did."
2,put batteriesin/could not get cover back on,I bought the tweeze yesterday. Put the batteries in and cannot get the cover back on. It started up when I was trying to get the cover on. I was suprised at how loud it is. It does hurt and I am afraid of ripping skin. Waste of money like most hair removers. Somebody needs to come up with a great one.
4,ejoi tweezers,This has been a great money saver and does a very thorough job. I loved it so much I purchased two additional for my daughters. Great item.
4,Works fine,"I bought this product for my mothers chin whiskers, and she reports that it does the job, although it does pull a little at times."
4,Love it!,"I was never sure about using this little gadet but when my mom ordered it and didn't like it, I tried it and LOVE it! She didn't like the discomfort it caused and didn't think it pulled out her really tough hairs very good. I, on the other hand did my whole chin, neck and most of my cheekbones. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I tried to do the upper lip and OUCH - would rather just lighten those with bleach cream. The rest of my face is soft and smooth and its been 5 days now. I was worried about stubble but nope, none of that because its tweezing,not shaving. I highly recommend. PS, my face was a little red afterward but that went away and they don't recommend if you have eczema or rosecea (I have both) but I didn't shave in those areas."
1,DOESN'T WORK FOR ME,"I'm a man, and I can tell you that this Emjoi didn't pull a single hair out of me.My girlfriend have a different one... I guess I'll have to borrow it again.This emjoi AP-9T is the worse thing I ever bought on Amazon."
2,Big disappointment,"Well I'm giving the tweeze 2 stars only because it does pull out a lot of the not-noticeable fine hairs, but that's really all it's got going for it. It hurts, (not intolerable, but still ...) it's noisy, (but that not too much of a problem) it's really inaccurate, (which makes the whole process way longer than expected) and often leaves the medium-big hairs behind (which is more or less the point). Also I would suggest prior and post cleansing of the area your using the tweeze on because the last time I used the tweeze my skin broke out like crazy on that specific area. My Mother order one the same time that I did and she expressed to me basically the same opinion. But I guess there are all kinds of hair/skin types in the world and that's how I figure this product got so many good reviews. And also since it's relatively cheap so it may still be worth the gamble but chances are, the odds are not going to be in your favor."
4,this is awesome,"I ordered this after seeing it advertised on the television a few times.I thought well, it isn't that expensive and I am sick and tired of tweezing my stray little hairs and can't see without my glasses anymore.You literally just hold this like a mini electric razor, and without cutting the hairs, it plucks them out at the speed of light. Well, not that fast but you could never tweeze as fast. You don't even need to look in the mirror, just go by feel and cover the area you want covered and feel with you finger to see if there is any that got missed.In ten minutes I accomplished what 40 mins. of plucking would have not done as well.This is really great and well worth the money.I have used Epilady in the past for my legs, it works on the same principle, just different method of removal, but still plucking. It feels about the same, it probably isn't for wimps, but it isn't uncomfortable either. Well worth it."
1,Didn't pull a thing,"I bought this for some hairs on my face. thought it would be good for a touch up or quickie thing. but it didn't pull a thing, not even break a hair. I have the Braun Epilady. I have dropped it, it's old and it still works like a charm.Good luck"
5,Works great!,"The Tweeze really does work well. I use it on my chin and neck and am very happy with the results. The only negative thing is that my lip area is too sensitive for it. Still, the product does the job!"
2,nothing like the commercial,"I saw the infomercial on this item and bought it due to the ""if you can feel it, tweezie can tweeze it."" not so much for me. I kept going over the same area as directed in the instructions but i still ended up having to use my manual tweezers. I was disappointed."
2,it hurts to much,dont buy it ppl its a waste of money and it irritates your skin causing scab looking mark on your face
2,Ouch!,"To be honest, haven't used this much. Why?? It hurts!!! It shocks the heck out of you to have a hair ripped from your body. The noise it makes doesn't help. On the other hand, the hairs did come out."
1,Emjoi AP-9T Tweeze,Does not work as advertised. You would be better off using a good pair of regular tweezers.I do not recommend this product.
1,YOU CAN CUT YOUR LAWN WITH THIS PRODUCT!,"I HAVE PURCHASED ITEMS FROM AMAZON BEFORE AND HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPOINTED. UNTIL NOW. WHEN MY PRODUCT ARRIVED I WAS SO EXCITED TO TRY IT TO REMOVE SOME UNWANTED FACIAL HAIR. IT WAS HORRIBLE! I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING ZAPPED WITH A LASER GUN. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING I WAS DOING WRONG, BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE TO NOT DO RIGHT. I ASKED ONE OF MY CHILDREN TO TRY IT AND THEY MADE ME LAUGH. THEY SAID ""WHAT IS THIS, A WEED WACKER? NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT IS NOW RECYCLABLE MATERIAL AS I DON'T WISH TO EXPERIENCE THE FEELING OF ELECTRIC SHOCK! MY RATING ON THIS PRODUCT? 1 OF 10, A BIG FAT ""0"""
1,scared of it,"i haven't used this thing yet. i bought it years ago at bed, bath and beyond. when i took it out the package to use it, the shear sound of it made me cringe. then when i took a closer look at the part that grabs the hair, i said NO WAY. i would feel more comfortable using my tweezers, they're painful but it's bearable, won't tear things off my face. it's still in the bottom of my closet."
1,Not worth it,"I'm glad to see that this product worked for some people. Sadly, it didn't do anything for me. I have thick black hairs from having PCOS, and hoped that this would aid in my every day battle with facial hair growth.Nope.-It's painful to use, but that's to be expected. It is TWEEZING after all. Though if you compare the commercial, to how it actually feels to use this product..you'd think that it had been forged by satan himself.-Didn't pluck hairs any better than just using a cheap pair of tweezers."
2,Just Can't Grab 'Em,"It might be me. I don't have particularly coarse hair, but this product is brilliant in concept but poor in actuality. It's very hard to ""aim"" the tweezing mechanism, though when you get it right, the plucking is quite quick and relatively painless."
1,EMJOI AUTOMICE TWEEZER,"THIS PRODUCT WAS VERY UNSATISFACTORY. IT DID NOT DO WHAT IT CLAIMED TO DO. THE HAIR IT SHOULD HAVE RMOVED IT DID NOT. IT PINCHED THE SKIN AND EVEN AFTER MOVING OVER THE SAME SPOT TIME AND TIME AGAIN IT STILL DID NOT REMOVE THE HAIR. IT STATED IT BATTERIES WAS INCLUDED THERE WHERE NONE. ALSO, IT STATED IT CREAM WAS INCLUDED THERE WHERE NONE."
1,Ouch,"Well this definitely removes hair, but it hurts/pinches and the hair doesn't stay gone very long. Also makes little bumps appear where the hair is removed. Not a good purchase for me."
1,"Promises, promises, promises . . .","Noisy, painful, and does not produce results promised. Another item for the trash bin."
4,Works as advertised.,"No complaints, does the job as advertised. Less painful than manual tweezing and much faster."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this product mainly to see how epilators worked in the first place. I tried it out on the top of my hand and then on my upper lip. IT does rather quickly remove the hairs, but frequently (about half the time) it cuts them instead of plucking from the root. I think this epilator is good if you are short on time and need some quick damage control before going out. But if you want flawless results, you need to wax or string."
2,Disappointed!,"I have to say I was very disappointed with this product. It will remove peach fuzz type of hair just fine, but not the coarse hair most people want removed. I still have to tweeze! - isn't there a product out there that works?"
1,Fell for this again.,"I can't believe I fell for this again, since I tried the Epilady years ago and returned it, and this is the same thing, only smaller. I can rub it all over my chin for five minutes, and it won't pull out any coarse black hairs, so what's the point? Every so often I feel a sharp sting, so it must get a fine hair that's just the right length at times. So, in the end, I still have to tweeze every day. Seems kind of pointless."
2,Emjoi AP-9T Tweeze,"Having owned one in the past, which worked wonderfully (unfortunately dropped and broke), I find that the motor on this one is not at all powerful. It drags and gives the impression that the batteries are old. I am really not satisfied with the product."
5,emjoi ap-9T,This is the best facial hair remover I have found in my 50 years of life. Stings a little when you first use it but then you get used to it and hardly notice it. It is great for me as I have poor eye sight and so I just go over the mustache and beard areas to make sure they are hairless. Before trying to tweeze by hand I would alway miss some because I couldnt see them.
2,ouch!,"No this is not the miricle we all were searching for!It hurts, like tweezing. Leaves the spot red & irratated!You get used to the pain, but not the bumps or red spots."
1,Waste of Money,"Unfortunatly this product did not meet up to my standards. Open the package carefully so that it will be easier to return. Better yet, invest 5 bucks in a good pair of tweezers unless you enjoy a red chin or hair maybe or maybe not being pulled after fifteen minutes of trying."
1,Eazy Tweeze.....not so much,"It is horrible and painful!! Don't waste your money. Just go get waxed, it hurts less and hair re-growth is much slower!!"
1,Not for those with sensitive skin,"I can stand a ""little pain"", so after reading the reviews here I decided to buy the Tweeze Tweezer. I gave it a try and ended up throwing it away. It is not just a little pain; in some places (upper lip area) it is very painful and not worth it IMO. I have sensitive skin which could be the problem and when I used it around my chin, my skin was not happy - it looked like I had welts in some areas and my skin was very red and swollen. I followed the directions of using it at a 90 degree angle, but it is just too much for my skin I guess. It was so cheap that I thought it was worth a try. For those with tougher skin that can take the pain, it may work just fine."
4,This Works Pretty Well,"I just go this item. I have fine blond hair fuzz on the sides of my face and some on my chin, which was really bothering me. I also have darker hair on my upper lip that i usually remove with a cream, but that leaves my skin red.This product worked quite well on the fine blond hair on the sides of my face. I was surprised how much hair was coming right off. It was a little addicting! I used it a little bit on my upper lip, but it does hurt/sting. It doesn't remove every hair,but it makes a definite noticeable improvement. I am very hard to please, but I like this product. It got rid of the fuzz."
1,No tweeze,"This might be useful if you never ever plucked hair from your face before. The only hair it removed for me were a few fine ones that no one could see anyway. Any visible hairs- the kind it claims to pull-were still there, no matter what direction I ran the product in.Amazon was great in processing a full refund."
1,Not up to expectations,I am very disappointed in the Tweeze Tweezer. It does not take off the hair very well and does pull when it is used. I would not buy it again.
1,Waste of money and time...didn't pull one hair!,"This was one that I should have read the reviews and took them to heart...this was a total waste of time. I was just so desperate to find something that worked I thought...why not! But I say...Why waste money??? It did not ""tweeze"" one hair and did however manage to pull some skin on my face though. Don't buy it!!!!"
5,very good,"it's working very well, not too painful. It leaves your skin smooth and no more facial hair. I recommand it."
1,Terrible,Terrible product. As soon as you lay it on your skin it stops running. The batteries are not powerful enough. Couldn't do anything with it. Not easy to return. Don't waste your money on this.
2,Not the right one,I bought this thinking it was something else. This did not work as well as the other and caused me some problems. I would not buy this again.
3,The top breaks easy,This is the 2nd one I have had and the little clear plastic top breaks easy need to redesign this
1,Waste of money.,"I purchased this item to use on my upper lip hair. The hair on my upper lip is not coarse or too short/long but this epilator didn't do anything. I tried it on the back of my hand and random parts of my arm to see if it could grab longer hair more easily but it still didn't work. Sometimes it would break hair off but it didn't really pull much out, if at all. I'll invest in a good wax instead."
2,Not as advertised!,"After reading all the information I could find about this product I decided it was worth a try. I'm still trying...I bought it mostly for the hair on the upper lip but I can only do a very small section at a time because it HURTS LIKE H---!!I cannot even imagine getting close to a bikini line with this device. It's not returnable either because to return it you have to leave it in that terrible, indestructible, plastic packaging so you can't find out how it works until you have destroyed that. This is the first Amazon product that I have not been satisfied with so I'm crushed."
2,"Good for small quickie ""clean up""","Only pulls out 1 or 2 hairs at a time. Thats good for the face. I have very fine & blond hairs on my upper lip. I only have a few darker noticable hairs that I like to pull out. Even after cleaning tweezer to get off any residue machine oil off- ***it still makes my skin break out something terrible.*** I figured if it worked for me I'd get one for my mom- nah. It takes entirely to long to do legs- And maybe because my hair is fine....it just breaks a lot of the hairs instead of pulling them out.I only have patches of hair on my legs- not much. It still takes to long & the batteries run dry very quickly. You'll have to buy yourself the Big battery pack!I'm thinking of giving it to my best friend, who by the way is Italian and has more of a upper lip problem- maybe she'll like."
4,Pretty good,"The product works pretty well, although there is a bit of a learning surve to it. It is a bit owie though, especially on the upper lip."
1,Worse purchase ever Sorry could not give it even one star,What was I thinking when I ordered the Tweezee. It was one of the worst ideas I ever had. The tweezee hurt so much. They should really ban this item.....
4,Does the job,It does the job like it states ... although shorter hair or fine hair is hard to pluck with the tweezey. Overall this is a good product.
4,Ow! Ow! Ow!,"Okay, just for the record, this thing is not painless. The product description above says it's painless, but don't be fooled. It feels like fire ants are biting your face. The instructions suggest trying it out on the hairs on the back of your hand before using it on your face. That is a good suggestion. I tried it out and am glad I did, that way I could brace myself for the pain when I used it on my face.That said, it does get rid of the hairs on your chinny chin chin. Just run it very lightly over the skin in a circular motion, making sure you're pulling your skin taut, and it will rip the hairs right out. Just be prepared for some pain."
1,Save your money,"Emjoi AP-9T Tweeze TweezerTweeze does not work as suggested in the ads. I had to run it over an area several times only to have it leave hair behind and break more hairs off just below the skin surface than it ever removed. These hairs would then become ingrown and or infected, be painful and look far worse as they grew out to a length to be tweezed and healed. Beyond this, the machine also pinches your skin if you do not hold it at just the right angle. As for the time you remain hair free, the claim that it is longer than conventional tweezing is absurd, both (were the Tweeze to have worked) remove the hair at the root! Give me my tweezers and a mirror and keep this piece of garbage, they work better, cost less and I do not end up with broken ingrown hairs. Also, I only gave it a star because I had to, the do not allow remarks without at least one."
3,good,it does what it is suppose to do that is why I bought it. It is the only thing on the market that does this
2,Glad I didn't get the bigger model,"This item works fine on fine hair, but cannot handle the tough hairs on my chin, which is the main reason I bought it. I was going to purchase the bigger model, but thought I'd try this one first. If your hair is very fine, then this will be great for you. Otherwise, back to tweezers and the big mirror or to hair removal creams."
4,"Pretty good, except for really fine hairs","Pretty good, except for really fine hairs. I still use it even though it does not necessarily work great on fine hairs but it beats using a tweezer for everything. Need tweezer still for fine hairs. I use it on lip."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this hoping for easy hair removal. It would quit easily just by removing fine facial hair, so it is not worth purchasing."
2,Not enough,"This product isn't easy to use or clean, and its quite painful. It did not retard hair growth. It did not do a thorough job; hand tweezing was required afterwards. Tried it on my legs, too; another disappointment."
3,Effective... but painful,"OK, the pain isn't exactly excruciating, but it isn't mild either. I have to prepare myself for what's coming, before I use this little gadget. It is effective, which is what matters most I guess, but I really do not care for items that are advertised as ""this"", and end up being ""that"". This product should not say ""PAINLESS"" on the package. That is a lie. No, this isn't a matter of opinion, and I am not overly sensitive to pain (I have 9 tattoos). It hurts. Period. It is also VERY LOUD. It sounds like friggin moped.Out of five, I give it three stars for it's ability to do what it says it does... remove hair. Minus 2 for shocking the hell out of my face, and scaring my cats with it's obnoxious tone."
3,"not as promised, but Ok","It doesn't tweeze as well as they say it will, but it does better than a ""hand"" tweezer. I use it, but I also still use a regular tweezer."
4,INNOVATIVE,"This thing is kool. It gets those stubborn hairs with very little discomfort, it feels like a lil yank onthe hair and poof its gone..it IS very noisy however"
5,I love this!,"This little gadget is awesome! It is well worth the money. It works great on getting those nasty chin hairs and moustache hairs, us women hate! Sure it stings a little, but so does a tweezer. This is much faster and the pain gets less the more you use it. The pain was worst on my sensitive upper lip and I barely feel it, now, after using it for a couple months. I don't understand the people that complain about hairs growing back fast. It pulls them by the root and they are going to grow back, just as fast, if you use a tweezer. If you don't want the hairs to grow back, pay up the money for a specialist. Also, this is not made for eyebrows. My husband loves this, too. I use it on the hairs on his ears and nose, before I give him a haircut. The only downside is that it does go through batteries fairly fast. But, it is worth it and I highly recommend it to everyone!"
2,Not as good as advertised,"It works on fine facial hair but not short stubby hairs. For the price I took the risk. It's just ""okay"", not what you hope for when you see it on TV."
2,works one hair at a time,"OK...this product does remove unsightly facial hair...but one hair at a time. It is extrememly painful. I have to really talk myself into using this as after I am done, I am sore and red for a couple hours. Is it worth buying? I don't know. Depends on if you are good at tolerating pain. And like I said in the beginning, it only takes out one hair at a time. That makes it seem like the process takes forever. I do use it but not as often as I should."
1,OUCH,Hurts a lot more than I thought it would. Not good for hair on the upper lip because it is so painful. Only good for the few wild hairs here and there
1,disappointed but expected,"I have old fashioned tweezers and I was trying to 'modernize' my arsenal. I could easily get an 'Anthony Davis' (Kentucky) type unibrow if I don't tame the beast bi-monthly. Which I do by going to a waxing place and having them clean up the brows. However, sometimes I just need to do it myself and the tweezers are time consuming. Gave this a try... not worth my time. Not consistent and didn't give me the results I needed. Usually give pretty good reviews on most products but this one stood out as a bad one unfortunately."
1,Hurts,Wife hates it.She will pluck or shave instead.This was a purchase to try and hope it helped from growing back so fast.But plucking and shaving is much easier & less painful.It's a good product if you can tolerate the pain.But the way it pulls is very painful.
1,worst product ever seen,"They are guaranteeing no scratching. But my face is sore and full of bumps after using it. Completely a waste of money and I hate it. It is not at all pulling out hair but ya one thing it is absolutely doing, making my face ugly by leaving sore, red and inflamed skin."
5,tweeze,Thank you for your quick service. Item was exactly what I ordered and was received in good shape. I know I will get quick quality service and items when I order through Amazon.
3,Smal Filter,"Good filter for a smaller tank, the specs say that this will work for a 10 gallon tank, I would think that this would work better for a 5 or less gallon tank. The water flow is good and the filtration is a sponge like element. No room for any carbon."
5,Clean,This filter works very well with a power mini filter. Does the job it is supposed to do and is inexpensive.
5,Great,"I ordered this product along with the Hagen Elite Underwater Mini-Filter. The filter was a little too strong for my betta fish, even on its minimum setting, so I just attached one of these to the output. Now everything is well! Be sure to order one of these with the filter."
3,review for combat,"i gave it to a friend for his birthday and watched with him,would reccomed it to anyone likes military movies"
3,not for the pro,"This is a pretty good starter router table. but the router that comes with it is a plunge router with no micro adjust knob.so it's very hard to adjust the bits height (you have to hold the table down while pushing the router up). i like the router table itself but i reccommend mounting a fixed base router in it and using the plunge for something else. the router itself is not the best router in the world but i find myself reaching for it the most. the plunge lock lever isn't nearly as easy to use as the one on the porter-cable 8529 but it works fine. one improvement that this router needs is a better chip shield, the one it has just will not stay on it keeps popping off!bottom line: this router/table combo is great for the ""weekend woodworker"" but i wouldn't reccomend it to professionals."
3,speakers a bit fuzzy,"when I turn up the speakers they make a fuzzy sound. I have a set just like them and it has better sound but the mic plug in on my old speakers are bad.. your mic plun in on your speakers work fine,, Just has fuzzy sound.. But I feel as I got ok deal. thanks .doug"
2,Not as advertised,"I purchased this ball after reading all of the other comments saying how great of a ball it was.Upon receiving it, I noticed that it was actually extremely large (way too big to be an NCAA ball, even larger than an NFL sized ball) and it did not resemble the football shown in the product picture. Nevertheless, my friends and I continued to use it as we are poor college students and didn't feel like buying another ball.Even though we played on grass, it was not very good at retaining it's shape, and soon had strange lumps. the seam was not straight either, and after awhile it became completely unusable.Eventually forked over the money for a MUCH better, $25 ball.tl;dr: Ball received was not the same as advertised. Spend 10 bucks more to get a nice ball."
1,130 dollars for something that isn't even shaped like a ball,A ball is round. A football is not round. Don't pay that much money for a lame object that goes to a lame game.
5,outstanding american quality,every once in a while you buy something that really stands out. this is a solid ball. i have had wilsons all my life and never once have i been disappointed.
4,Great kids football,"I ordered a football for my oldest son (10) for Christmas. When it came, it didn't look like the football I ordered and even better, it wouldn't hold air for more than 2 mins. Returned it, and was sent another football. The second one I got was this one, the right one, and it holds air. Excellent size for the age, well balanced, and spirals very nice."
1,"Ball separating at the seams, no response from Wilson.","The ball was used for playing catch, punting, kicking, etc., not for a game. The ball began to separate at the seams. My wife contacted Wilson and we have heard nothing. Possibly could be this particular ball, but given that Wilson has not returned an email we are very disappointed in this purchase. We will be purchasing a new ball, but not from Wilson."
5,Great Ball,"This ball its great. amazing football looking. great quality for this money, great deal at a low price. even smell great"
2,Worked great and then fell apart,Was very happy with this football so when our other one was lost we bought it again. For some reason it started pulling apart (not at the seam) and there is now a one inch hole in it. Where the whole is the inner part of the ball is bulging out. It was not left out in the rain or anything.I am going to write to Wilson and ask for a refund.
1,Ball Leaks Like a Seive,"The ball arrived and I did not use it until several months after it arrived. When I tried to inflate it, it would not hold air.In short, the ball was a fail."
1,Poorly made football,"In less than a month after receiving this football for his birthday (my grandson) - the ball came apart at a seam and the bladder became exposed, causing the ball to be unuseable, we are now working with the manufacturer to receive a warranty replacement - the freight to return the item for warranty has now added another $7.00 to the purchase price, and we're not sure if it will be replaced - recommend spend a little more, and get a better ball."
3,good football but with poor durability,"I purchased this football just a couple of weeks ago. Out of the box i was really happy with what i got. I used it almost every other day and often on pavement. After getting a little scratch close to the seems the scratch kept on expanding to a hole until the air-filled rubber had squezzed itself way out through the hole.I know it's not designed for use on pavement, but I'm still disappointed about the durability."
2,It was great while it lasted,"Me and my roommate used it almost daily, and the seams started to stretch. today they cracked after using it for about 3-4 months. Now I can't even return it for a new one."
1,Defective Football,Purchsed this football at a high price thinking it would be of superior quality. WRONG! Nothing but a piece of junk. Would not inflate or hold air nor was feel of material any good. Football I purchased at Walmart for half the money was 10 times better quality. I do not recommend purchasing this product.
2,disapointing,"i have bought this candy for several years now. this year the consistency has changed and not in a good way. the candy is tough, difficult to bit into. you end up having to put the whole thing in your mouth and gumming it. i much prefer the consistency the candy had in the past."
4,A much better version of the Haribo Gummi Grapefruit slices--if you like gummis with good chew,"I love Haribo traditional gummis (e.g. bears, etc.), but I am not a fan of the standard grapefruit slices--they are much softer than the traditional gummi, with very little chew.This product is the special Kosher version of these gummis. As such, it can't contain geletin, and so the ingredients are much different. And so is the texture: These are extremely chewy (even hard when you first bite into them, then turning to a nice chew)--think certain forms of hard licorice. The flavor and appearance is the same as the traditional grapefruit slices, but these are (for me, anyway) much preferable."
4,good for the price,This video is a little dated but enjoyable to watch and in good taste.Nothing unusual or exotic here but certainly worth the price.
1,High price for a bucket,"Just save some money and buy a 2.50 bucket at any Hardware Store. You can get the seats for ten bucks anywhere. Frankly i was disappointed at the ""crappy"" seat. Poor quality. Save your money."
5,A one t ime psychology session for only $26!,"I am so glad that I heard about this book! I have been to hundreds of pyschology sessions at a whoping $150 an hour! My problems were with the man I was shacking up with for 10 years! Anxiety is what I was feeling but couldn't put my finger on it. When I got ahold of the book it answered so many questions I had and more!! After reading it ( I finished it in 6 hours)the next night when my ""friend"" came home from work (late as always with an exuse) I told him he was moving out on the weekend. That it was over and I actually felt empowered instead of cowaring and weak! I just have to say to the author THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HARD WORK. I feel so proud of myself and happier than I thought I could EVER be because of your book. I am telling ALL my girlfriends (there are 8 of them living together) to get this book AND to keep it in plain view for their honey's to see. Wow, you talk about being liberated! I am and I'm loving it!"
3,"beautiful music, but....","I love classical music. But I expected this CD to be played as Paul's unique style of music; kind of jazzy, precise and cheerful. In this album, two thirds of 12 tracks were recorded with new arrangement by Paul's way, but the rest(track 1,2,3 & 11) were performed like original classics. As for ""Andante from piano concerto no. 21 by Mozart"", the old version(maybe recorded in 70's) is a lot better...more than I can say.If I had wanted to listen to original classics for these titles, I would chosen Karajan or Bernstein. That is why I rate this CD as 3 stars. ....Paul, you don't have to be a Karajan even in performing classics. I just want your own style!!...Best tracks : ""Twilight Serenade""(written by Paul) and ""Intermezzo from Carmen"""
4,Soooooo small.,"TINY. If you want to cut down on weight, this stove is great. You may have to mind the valve a bit more than on other stoves, but it is well built, cooks fast, and provides a sturdy base for small pots."
5,Better than stoves twice this price... not to mention lighter and smaller.,"This is an excellent backpack stove. I've used it for the past year, including a solid month of use in the Adirondacks, and it has never failed me once. Just make sure you buy quality fuel, I've had the best luck and burn time with snow peak giga and jetboil canisters. Awesome, light, tiny, hot stove."
5,Philip Quast Solo Album,This is Philip Quast's solo album. A very eclectic mix of songs. The more I listen to it the more I love each and every one of the songs.
1,"Repeat after me, Philip Quast: I am not a rock star!","What a disappointment. After hoping for more than just another version of ""Stars"" from the best Javert ever, I find out he is basically a one-trick pony. The choice of music is totally wrong, the orchestra and arrangements are cheesy, and, what's more, he's having a bad voice day. Also, his use of (very) foul language referring to the baby he and his wife were expecting during the rehearsal of Sunday in the Park is unexpected and unsettling. Add the most unflattering album cover ever and you have a sense of this misguided and mean-spirited mess. After buying this, I feel like the CD's listless live audience sounds: Miserable!"
3,Couldn't get it on my frame.,"This derailleur hanger is made well and the finish is nice, but I couldn't get it to fit onto my SM1000 frame."
1,how know,I did this review before. I don't understand it . Well We will try acain. It sucked. End of review. ART
3,Vermont American 23460 Dovetail Fixture,"I bought this jig to make some kitchen drawers. I have never made dove tails before. I found the machine easy to assemble and the directions to be clear. It is a hit and miss process to get the right dovetail length. Too long and the wood won't go together. Too short and the joint is loose. Make pratice cuts before trying your finished project. The jig alignment is dead on accurate. My only complaint is that the bar used to clamp the wood tends to put two horizontal dents into it. The use of a pad will remedy that problem. Its a good, light duty jig."
5,Good value,"This is an ideal for the the weekend small investment woodworker. Urge new users play around with scraps before just jumping in. Making sure the pieces are marked as to front left inside. Left side front. I used the jig to make Lexan drawers out of 1/4 "" thick material and they all came out perfect."
1,Something Smells and It Isn't Simon Weil's Rotting Corpse,"What a self-indulgent load of dung. This is supposed to be music? It sounds like a cement mixer full of cats and hornets. Leonard Pinthe Garnell would be proud, though."
4,WHAT A FIND!,What a FIND! I had no idea the internet had so much to offer as far as free stuff for folks like me who like to sew; patterns (printable and by mail order) fabric samples etc! I would recommend anyone who sews to definitely get this book its is definitely worth the price!
3,This book was very good when published,This book was very good when published but since that was in 1999 many websites have dropped out of sight. It needs to be updated.
3,Just ok,Not a bad product for the price but difficult to get a reading on concrete floor prior to installing glue down flooring.
5,Excellent Product,Bought this not expecting that much but I've used it several times most recently in the attic to locate leaks and it worked wonderfully as others have mentioned the design and placement of the on/off switch could be better but it really preforms well and I really don't notice it anymore. And opposed to what another reviewer stated I found that it will give you an indication for all three levels of wetness. I was thinking about possibly getting a more expense one that will give you a percentage but after using this one I now can't justify the price. Thinking about maybe getting another one of these as a backup though for the price it's really unbeatable!
3,Moistur Meter,"Product has indicators for various (3) degrees of ""wetness"", but expect to use only two Dry or Wet. Even the slightest amount of moisture will return a Wet result. Other than that the product is fine.Sonin 50210 14% to 20% Pin LED Wood, Concrete, Plaster, Carpet and More Moisture Meter"
2,its ok,"first she could not sing!! and Her english was so bad!! i should be buy tehlma aoyama cd !!! so waste of money.,,"
4,Good kit for the price!,All you need to maintain your re-useable air filter. Read some reviews about folks purchasing two and three Airhog filters because they were so cheap...and were going to throw them away??? HELLO...wash it and re-oil and save the landfills. Thanks :)
5,Excellent translation,One of the greatest spiritual epic poems ever written - this is a wonderful and lively version.
3,Not too bad,"If you liked the first book, The Art of Warcraft, then you'll probably enjoy this one, too. As expected, this book is packed with concept art and beautifully painted digital art. From characters to environments, this book has it. However, unlike The Art of Warcraft book, this one doesn't have as much text to explain the new characters, environments, and weapons. This book, as well as The Art of World of Warcraft book, seems like it was slapped together in a hurry so that it could be released to the public.If this one had more text behind it and a little more organization, I would have given it more stars, but for those of you who care only for illustrations, then this book will probably appeal more to you."
1,WHAT THEY DONT TELL YOU,"WHAT ""THE MOUNTAIN"" DOESN'T TELL YOU ABOUT THIS SHIRT IS THAT THE CAT IS SLEEPING ALL SOUNDLY AND WHATNOT BECAUSE IT JUST ATE THE HEART AND PRESUMABLY THE WHOLE TORSO OF THE POOR SOUL WEARING IT. NOT ONLY WILL THIS SHIRT KILL YOU, BUT IT WILL ALSO TAKE YOUR DIGNITY.BUY THE WOLF T-SHIRTS INSTEAD.MUCH BETTER QUALITY."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,This night light is beautiful! Well made and just bright enough for late night feedings. The on off switch is in a good spot and seems durable. I would recommend to any frog lover!
4,LG from VA,"These are very nicely crafted shoes. The product description says ""gold leather."" I first thought the picture was not accurate because the shoes appeared more ivory or a light beige. These shoes are definitely not gold. They are almost silver with a faint touch of green. They are very pretty and comfortable. Just don't expect these to be gold. (If they are golden, I would like to know what variation of gold they are referring to here.) The image is fairly accurate."
5,where was I when these things were invented?!,"Just got the item today. It was well packaged and shipped fast. The item itself is small, pretty quiet, and has everything to just get to ripping those unwanted hairs out. I've been waxing for the last 2 years, I like to wax mainly my eyebrows now because waxing anything else is just to time consuming and messy. I used this as soon as it arrived on my legs and bikini line. It does a great job. I have coarse and fine hair and it seems to get them all. I'm so excited to not have to mess around with wax, or waste so much money on razors! I don't think this is the best thing for your face though because of the pain. I have a high tolerance to waxing, but facial hair (youch!) I'd rather just tweeze that. I read all the reviews before I bought this, and I've got to say, I'm 100% happy so far! If it lasts even a year, it will save me so much money. And it's summer now, who wants to shave every other day and deal with razor burn?! Not this lady!"
2,ok as a back-up,"It's not very powerful and it feels cheaply made. The head is small (of course, it's a ""mini"") so it takes a while to use on the legs. I was not impressed by this machine but I got it as a backup to my regular epilator (just in case it stopped functioning, lost during travel, etc.). My main epilator eventually stopped working so I went to my backup. It pulled a small piece of skin into the part between the rotating heads, jammed and it stopped working.I am not going to purchase this particular machine again due to how weak the machine is."
3,"Not all hair removed, doesn't last","The product does remove hair and it doesn't hurt. I liked it a lot better than shaving because I never felt that prickly feeling. However it certainly doesn't give you that totally clean feel that waxing/shaving does. No matter how much I used it, I always had a bunch of longer hairs. Also, I had difficulty getting into the recesses of my under arms. Mine lasted about 1 1/2 years. I used it about 2-3 times a week."
4,Works well; Short Product Life,"I have used other epilators. What I liked about this one was the size and the contoured, dual opposed tweezers. I used it mostly for arm hair - fine, dark hair. The epilator easily removed it. I cannot imagine that the results last for SIX weeks for most people. You'd have to have a very small amount of blonde hair to get away with that.I've used it on arms, legs, bikini line, and facial hair (that wasn't recommended). I have a lot of leg hair, and have experienced ingrown hairs when I've epilated my legs. Plus, it took way too long to epilate my legs - it's just easier to shave. I imagine if you had a SMALL amount of leg hair, the epilator would be fine for legs.Yes, epilating is PAINFUL. Hey, it's pulling out hair. What do you expect?My biggest complaint is that the unit is now broken simply from regular use. (I've had it a little over a year - past warranty.) A little part broke, and since I can't replace just the part, I have to replace the whole thing."
3,functions but ...,"this little one certainly spins nice. It is very small and compact as expected. no problems with its operation, however, I don't prefer the dual rollers with opposite spin. The guard also is a place that can grab the skin. In a pinch I'd use it (pardon the punn)."
2,not great,"I bought an Emjoi about 10 years ago and loved it. It lasted until just a couple years ago. I got the OptiMini Epilator to replace it and was very disappointed. I don't think the dual opposing heads are a good addition - they make it very difficult to target certain areas. Also, the middle is recessed too much so on many parts of the body the middle tweezers don't reach your hair. I am returning this and trying a different model."
3,Durabilty is it's biggest down fall,"I've owned epilators since they were first introduced to the market. I've owned 3 of the Emjoi Optima's, (5 Emjoi's total) With all 3 Optima models, the rotating heads quit working. The 1 year warranty does not cover the cost of shipping the unit back to the vendor. In April, Customer Service required me to return the entire unit. They returned it with the original body and I suppose a new head. But the head has quit again, but I am out of warranty, and out of luck. Emjoi does not sell replacement parts. The motors also last about 1.5 years before dying. But I refuse to return to shaving."
5,great!,This product is just great! It gets the job done! And it is so small and portable. I would definitely recommend this product.
1,not worth it,"I bought this hoping this will be better than shaving and last longer, but its not good, first of all it doesn't remove all the hair and second its very very painful and very very slow, if you have lots of free time to spend shaving the most painful way posible (I have done wax and wax doesn't hurt compare to this) then this is your product.Other bad thing it produces ingrown hair THE horror!!"
1,This gave me razor rash,"It wasn't painful at all to use it. But I have really high pain tolerance. I already pluck my armpits and I can tweeze the hair from my legs without feeling anything. Even if it was painful, I would have put up with it as long as it worked. IT DID NOT. I followed the instructions carefully and even applied Tend Skin before and after I used it. Not only it broke off so many hair, leaving me with prickly skin, but I also got major folliculitis. It's been almost 2 weeks since I last used it (I actual tried it twice. Really shouldn't have done that.) and the folliculitis are slowly healing. I just hope it won't leave any scars but I know I can't show my legs for the rest of this summer. If you are prone to getting razor bumps after shaving, waxing, etc. I suggest that you try something else. This is such a disappointment and I was so excited to try it too."
3,Myeh.,"Though I would consider myself to have a high pain tolerance I was nervous about trying the epilator for the first time. I tried the epilator on a small section of my calve and was surprised that it didn't hurt much - it felt a little like getting shocked in the first few seconds but it wasn't excrutiatingly painful during the entire process. I was surprised at how fast the ""low"" setting was and midway through I switched to ""high"" but didn't notice much difference in pulling/pain. I felt like the epilator didn't get all of the hair and I would have to go over and over the same section for a few minutes. I switched to my bikini area and had the same problem. For someone who gets a Brazilian often this was not worth my time to use it; for the time and pain it's better to just get a wax in my opinion."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!,"This item was no longer functional after its third use in three months. The switch was not operational at all. It did work well upon its first and only first use. Unfortunately, upon its return the customer will not receive a full refund. I do not recommend this product."
1,Ladies this does not work don't buy it,I decided to buy this epilator because it has dual heads and claims to remove more hair with them. It does not. I followed all the instructions and prepared before i used it with terrible results. It cuts most of the hair but it does not pull it out by the root. It is very painful and it gave me red blotches and all that without removing the hair from the root. I promptly returned it. Ladies do not waste your money or time.
2,Not Usual Emjoi Quality,"Emjoi AP-96 OptiMini EpilatorI am disappointed in model AP-96 Optimini Epilator. I have purchased several other Emji products,all of which are great! But this one is not up to their usual standard. It pinches skin between the moving parts and the edge of the housing - occasionally, which can be painful."
3,"Russ Meyer's ""VIXEN""","I gave it 3 stars for all the sexy brief nudity but it was too edited on the sex scenes,was lead to believe that it was more graphic of the Russ Meyer films,I liked the women but it was not as good as advertised,too candid on the hot scenes.too cut!"
5,A quote from Richard at www.Christmasreviews.com,"""Of Special interest to Christmas music Collectors tired of listening to the same eight Christmas songs each year.""There's more to Singer's Christmas vision than just reporting a sad incident of sibling rivalry. He also introduces impersonator Dennis Kolb, who performs ROCKIN' CHRISTMAS STOCKIN' and MY WARM CHRISTMAS HEART On Classic 'Big EL Blues Christmas' fashion. My favorite new tune, though, is ""Mr. Snow"", a retro-pop tune I couldn't get out of my head. Of further note is The Old Christmas Hearth, A Connie Francis-worthy anthem featuring the voice of Connie Francis-worthy Georganna Barry-Singer.""{Go to: www.Christmasreviews.com/xhanukkahharry.shtml} for Richards entire review of I Saw Hanukkah Harry Beat Up Santa"
5,Good Tai Chi music,"I have bought this CD because that is the music my Tai Chi instructor uses, and I found it engraved in me to the point I was humming it at different times throughout the day. It helps me focus and perform my movement much more fluidly when I practice. I really love to do Tai Chi to this music."
3,Meh Game about a great subject.,"This is a pretty game. This is a game with lots of events. Yeah! I have found the positive in this game. Ok, the real deal. THis game is pretty fu, but not really fun. You will not want to play it again and again. However, if you are using it to show your kids the gist of the olypics, or want the family to get into the spirit of the olympics,then jump in and enjoy yourself. Is it worth the price? No. Wait for the bargain bin, but only if you really got to have it for some reason other than playing a fun game."
3,Is it just me or is Resident Evil a hard game?,This is a useful and detailed guide but be warned you still have to write your own notes on what you did wrong and accidentally and do some backtracking. I think Prima guide is probably more helpful but I havent purchased that yet.Also Rogue Leader really isnt especially confusing but RE is.Still love the graphics though.
3,Good Strategy Guide,"This strategy guide was pretty good but lacked some of the extras more recently published strategy guides have. The writing was pretty well done and easy to follow for the most part. I desperately wish that they would have included mini-maps to accompany the written walk-through, it would have made things much easier at times, however being in the position of actually NEEDING a mini-map to help during the course of the game is rare. The guide is pretty well comprehensive and makes traversing through the mansion so much easier. I find that the game is best enjoyed however by briefly skimming over the upcoming hardships, preparing, and just going at it as best as I can without the guide unless I get stuck. The poster in the back is kind of ""meh"", but besides that, it's a pretty good guide. A-."
1,Rear Gate,The rear gate on the fold it cart is a pain to install. I find I never use mine. If I had to do it again id buy just the cart.
3,Sometimes Needed,"This is a pain to put on, take off, or store on the cart. But sometimes, such as when hauling loose materials, it's needed. Wear gloves when you remove/replace it. I haven't cut myself on the semi-sharp edges YET."
3,Not bad,"A little bulky, but it gets the job done. Would be better if it was realy clear and not mostly black"
2,"Tries, but fails","(...)I found myself constantly wondering just how brave is it to tell men everything they want to hear, how rebellious to promote the by-men for-men commercialized sex industry, how courageous to reaffirm that there's no need to change or examine our sexuality so long as we unthinkingly act out our culturally-produced desires (especially the capitalist ones where shopping=liberated female sexuality.)Fluffy, shallow, and not very much in-depth feminist critique."
4,Unique (in a good way),"This collection of songs from DoD's past albums is an interesting mix of darkness and despair. The album is elctronic in nature, leaning perhaps a little into the industrial side on some tracks. There are a couple of soft ballads as well, but most of the songs on this album are rather driven. There are a few noticably fantastic tracks that will jump out and bite you on the first listen, but after a number of spins, the rest of the album blends together nicely. It's a good listen from beginning to end that, and I hate comparisions, is similar to...well...nothing really, but if you like German-influenced Goth with sharp and cold electronics swirled in...this is for you. Great for those in-between days when those Projeckt bands are too low and Rosetta is just too damn peppy...*wink* 4 Stars."
4,not my favorite...,"this is not my favorite cd but it was alright. i'm don't care much for ballads and this had a few...yes, i know most do have a ballad. the songs also sounded similiar in ways and i prefer more of a mix on a collection cd."
3,No Title,"I have used this product in the past but I prefer the Host Defense brand. I switch them up sometimes to get different variations of mushrooms, but this isn't my brand of choice."
1,This product needs serious investigation...If that was herxheimer effect I was feeling from just one dose...then I suspect a lar,Okay I will repeat it here... I ordered this product to kill off candida...mainly to research the formula...One dose...damn near killed me!!! This formula needs investigation!!!
2,Far less than 120 capsules,"Only started taking the product 10 days ago, so am not sure just yet how well it's working for me internally. My gripe, however, is with the amount of capsules contained in the bottle. The manufacturer claims it provides 120 capsules. However, I just did a count and only 60 capsules remain in my bottle. I've been taking 4 per day since I started 10 days ago, so by my count, that means I was only provided with 100 capsules."
3,Clone On,"Unless I am mistaken this book has some recipes that were in his other Clone books. I have seen the Liberty Ale recipe before. Still this book is well worth having, if you are looking for a clone recipe book with some great and varied recipes. The layout is very well thought out giving you: Extract, Mini Mash and All Grain versions of each recipe.I have worn out the other Clone books I have by Him and His Wife."
2,Doesn't hit the spot,"When buying a book with clone recipies, i expect to find some good clones. Perhaps the beers will taste a bit like the original, i haven't tested all recipies. However, there are some beers i know a bit about the original recipe. The listed recipes for a supposed clone of these beers are way off. It springs to mind that these beers have only been brewed using the extract recipes?I do still rate it 2 stars however, because it's sometimes better to have a doubtful recipe than none. I wouldn't blindly trust a recipe, be critical. Example: Vlaskop is brewed using 40 unmalted barley, which isn't mentioned here at all.One thing i do like are the tables about yeasts and malt.It could well be a good book for extractbrewers, for all-grain it certainly isn't. The conversions from extract to all grain are just to simple to be true."
1,Good For Beginners Looking For a Beer in the same Style,"I ordered this book because I heard it had a recipe for a specific beer I really like. I am a fairly advanced homebrewer for almost 8 years, so I can control my beer pretty well. I also know how to read labels of the beer I wanted to make... and the recipe in this book, had only 2 of the several ingredients mentioned on the bottle. Even the table of contents in the front of the book list the beers by style, and NOT by the beer they ""captured"".So if you are looking to make beers in the same Style as a favorite commercial beer... then this is for you... If you are looking for a beer even close to a favorite, look elsewhere."
5,You can't ask for a better book sequel!,"More great recipes from the writers of the original Clone Brews. A lot of Belgian recipes! This book contains food suggestions to serve with your beer (or is it the other way around) and some cooking recipes. Very useful tables in the back. This book is good for everyone, from the beginner to the expert.Phil (President, New York City Homebrewers Guild)"
1,No Space!,Once I got the bag there was no space for anything. The stiching was not on there well either. The comparments were very tight and limited to space I couldnt look through it if I needed to find something.
1,bag stinks,I only use it since I don't have another one. The lining also has come undone. I thought it was only mine....I wrote to Eddie Bauer about it and they said they don't manufacture it someone else does - they really need to do some quality control since another daiper bag I have from them the zipper broke.. I wrote to them as well and I haven't heard back.SH
1,Don't let the Eddie Bauer name fool you!!,"I wish I had read the reviews before putting this item on my registry. I was happy when I first got this backpack since there were compartments for my personal items so I didn't have to carry my handbag along with this backpack. My husband also was agreeable to carrying the backpack as opposed to a traditional diaper bag. After four weeks of using this item, the lining ripped. Now I'm afraid that when I use it, the threads will get caught in the zipper! I'll just have to be careful until I get a replacement diaper backpack.....definitely not another one of these!"
2,Bad luck for Eddie Bauer,"I was so excited to start using my new Eddie Bauer backpack/diaper bag, and it was wonderful...until the lining ripped! I guess Eddie Bauer doesn't always make the highest quality items. I returned the bag and bought the Columbia Baby Backpack. It's really too bad that the Eddie Bauer bag has so many poor reviews, and yet it is still on the market."
2,"Good bag, poor lining",I have enjoyed this back pack style diaper bag for about 3 months. The lining has suddenly torn and I am very disappointed. Obviously it got a lot of use in those 3 months but I would imagine diaper bag manufacturers must realize this.
1,Don't buy it,"I receive this diaper bag as a baby shower gift. After 4 weeks of using it, the lining ripped just as all the other reviews. Back then I thought it was a defect on this bag, so I went to the store and returned it and got the same bag. Well, it tear away TOO!! Please don't purchase this diaper bag, is not worth it."
1,"Nice on the outside, horrible on the inside","Please don't even consider this bag. Like many other reviews the lining on the inside ripped from the top and just kept on ripping. I didn't even over stuff the bag, it was maybe half full when it ripped. It did last a few months, but it wasn't worth the money. Why spend money on something you use everyday, just so that it will fall apart. I purchased the Columbia Baby Backpack after this one ripped, and its holding up A LOT better. It is smaller than this one, but it does the job. A diaper bag it too important to go cheap, please don't buy this bag!"
1,Doesn't hold up,"We purchased this backpack to take on a week-long trip (we have a 2-year-old son. For the first few days, it worked great. Plenty of space, bottle holders on either side (we used it for sippy cups and water bottles!). However, days before the trip ended, all of the inside lining ripped off from the top down. So any time we'd try to reach in and get something, our hands would get caught in a tangled ""web"" of mesh. Thus, we returned the backpack to the store once we returned home from our trip. Definitely not worth the hassle or the price."
1,Great idea- Poor Construction,I too wish that I had read the reviews before purchasing this bag. My husband and I agreed on this bag for two reasons- 1. It was Eddie Bauer and 2. He would carry it also (it was not too fufu looking).We purchased it prior to a trip to Colorado after two weeks the inner linning of the outside pocket ripped all over- not only do things get lost inside- the inner stuffing of the linning rips and gets all over your things- this does pose a safety hazard for your little one- it cn get on their blanket and then ingested.After rading the other reviews I am wondering why Eddie Bauer has not recalled the bag.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"I wish I had read the previous reviews before buying this bag. Like the other reviewers, I am on bag number 2, in which the lining has ripped again in less than 4 months. Unfortunately Babies R Us will not let me return it as their 90 day return policy has expired and told me to call the manufacturer. I have done so but no one has called me back.With my first child, I had great luck with a gray Eddie Bauer backpack and thought this one would be just as good.I am not counting on seeing my money back and have purchased a backpack from Baby Innovations that I am hoping will not be as shoddily constructed as this one."
4,Good movie ... should give it a try.,"Just watched it on IFC. Counldn't stop watching it! Great film, funny, wit, good acting and directing."
5,With insightful behind-the-scenes notes and anecdotes,"Now in a newly revised and significantly expanded second edition, Classic Sitcoms: A Celebration Of The Best In Prime-Time Comedy by television history expert Vince Waldron provides tv sitcom fans with a complete episode-by-episode summary and guide to ten of the all-time best television sitcoms, as chosen by forty-five top TV critics. ""I Love Lucy""; ""The Honeymooners""; ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""All In The Family"", ""M*A*S*H"", ""The Bob Newhart Show"", ""Taxi"", and ""Cheers"" are presented with insightful behind-the-scenes notes and anecdotes from the stars, writers, and producers. Complete credits, basic episode storylines, and tallies of Emmy awards and yearly ratings make Classic Sitcoms a superb and highly recommended resource for TV fans and trivia buffs alike."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped - I returned it,"The book's 600+ pages led me to believe it was going to be an in-depth study of the ten chosen sitcoms, but alas each program only gets about a 6- to 10-page writeup, followed by a huge episode guide. The ep guides are not at all compelling reading, and actually pale to guides done by fans on various websites.There aren't a lot of photos, and the ones that are there are aligned in strange, overlapping, sometimes slanted format in a 10-page section in the book's dead center. They're B&W; and actually look poor even for B&W.;This book gets one thing right: the ten shows selected were the absolute cream of the crop up to that point (""Seinfeld"" would probably have bumped one of them out a few years later), but this book really doesn't add anything to the reader's enjoyment of these classics. I suggest you pass on this one.Overall,"
1,It was a fight to finish this book,"Maude Barlow does not like free trade. Why she has written so many books about hating free trade, and by extension freedom to associate and contract with other people, is a mystery. If she could state just what is so bad about free markets perhaps some meaningful dialogue could take place. Barlow main point is that it is bad if people who run corporations make money, but it is okay is labors make money. What does she favor one group of workers over the other? Well, firstly she does not consider managers to be doing any type of meaningful work, yet she gives no reason for why she believes this. Secondly, like the previous review her dislike of foriegn corporations borders on xenophobia, Barlow knows this and actually states that she is not xenophobic, but making such statement is meaningless given the position she has staked out."
1,In Praise of Economic Illiteracy,"In voluntary economic transactions one person's gain is always another's loss. That is the lesson of Maude Barlow. It's a compelling argument until you think about a bit. If a foreign company sells goods in Canada at a price lower than that of Canada firms, Barlow would have you believe that all Canadians are worse off. After all, the competition is destroying Canadian jobs. However, while there may be job losses, all Canadian benefit from the lower prices of the imports, allowing us to purchase more goods.Would the world be better off if the government required all buildings to board up all their windows? After all, the sun ""unfairly"" competes with the producers of lightbulbs and candles, thus requiring all windows to be boarded up would stimulate these industries. Within Barlow's, and others, such as Linda McQuiag, this is a logical premise. Go read Frederic Bastiat before reading Barlow's book, in simple language he shatters all of her arguments."
5,Molly,I am collecting good golf movies for a friend of mine for Christmas/Birthday. This was a great movie with a heart warming message.
4,Seven Days in Utopia,Good show that seeks to bring out the best in a person. Faith works! I would recommend it for anyone looking for good things that encourages and builds up.
4,7 days in Utopia,Must see-- Its not a golf movie its a great movie if you like a great story set in the Texas Hill country. Makes one ponder as to whats important and what not in life and how country folks looks at things.Rent it or buy it while it still available and by the way your whole family can watch the show.
5,Seven Days in Utopia,Seven Days in Utopia is a very good uplifting movie especially if you are a golfer. The book is very good also.
3,"Karate Kid for golf, but boring","I liked that the movie was clean. That was very refreshing.It just was slow and dull, though. Maybe I would have liked it better if I liked to play golf. Maybe I would have liked it better if I hadn't been expecting to like it alot. I had seen Robert Duvall and Lucas Black together in the movie ""Get Low"" and thought it was an excellent movie. So my expectations for this movie were too high."
3,Never really gets going,Pretty blah acting and story line. Just felt hollow. Not much real golf in it either. Could have been so much more.
5,Terrific Movie For Your Soul,"I recommend this movie for, not only passionate golfers (like myself), but also for anyone who enjoys the human interest stories about rebounding from the depths of defeat. The acting is all terrific and Robert Duval is spot-on in his role. I must have watched this about a half dozen times and it is a favorite that will be re-played like a yearly Christmas special."
3,An OK rental. Would not buy in hindsight.,"This movie was just ok. It was packaged a little too neatly if you know what I mean. Could have used more substance and more intensity. I wanted more from this movie, especially since it starred my favorite actor Robert Duvall."
5,My Life in Transition,"I needed something to inspire me. This was it. Health issues plagued not only my body, but my mind. I haven't played golf in over 25 years and don't expect ever to play again. However, this movie, regardless that it was about a golfer, pulled me out and over the dark pit. My finger tips had become weary from hanging on to the edge."
5,Brilliant!,An relaxed paced movie with a really great message. The story helped me to stop and think about some deep questions in my life. What I am doing? What am I missing? What am I not letting go of? I did not expect this seemingly random movie about golf to speak on such a deep level.
2,"Great book, mediocre movie","Not sure if they tried to get too much into the movie from the book. Things such as the relationship tension was very dry and didn't fit very well. It seemed like it was forced into the movie. I would've loved to see more actual golf in the movie. Some more of the lessons they worked on together and focus on the SFT idea. Great book with great insight, but the adaptation was lousy."
5,A Movie You Will Want to Have in Your Collection Forever,"Every person I saw this movie with, and I saw it in the theater more than once with several different people, said the same thing, they loved it and wanted to own it on video. Recently, I talked to a woman whose son worked as a crew member. He said the crew didn't have high hopes for this modest-budgeted film at the time, and they were all surprised at just how good it turned out to be when it was released.It's a feel-good movie about accomplishing dreams that makes a person want to see it again and again. They even make golf interesting. The faith aspect of it is sweet and comforting and never mushy. The scenery is beautiful; the characters are great; Duvall is the best! He rides his horse on the golf course! Have the Kleenex handy, it will touch your heart."
4,Nice movie,We had visited a bed and breakfast next door to the golf course and wanted to see the movie. I had read the book as well. Great family entertainment!
2,Looked good --- but,"Liked the easy to use controls but toaster does not toast. Whether toasting bread or bagels, the bread never darkens -- only gets slightly warm and slightly hard. Also, takes a really long time to get your untoasted toast."
3,slow toast,I bought this toaster to get evenly toasted bread....it doesn't. It is very slow also. Very big too.
2,Cheap mannequin,"I got this mainly for the portable mannequin - something to take with me on my travels. But the springs keep it way too stiff, so I have nearly an impossible time of posing the darn thing. The Art S Buck anatomical figures are _much_ better. In all, it's a nice _idea_ for a set, but the quality leaves something to be desired. Turns out this product was made in China."
4,Nice and Sturdy! Great Value! Easy to Assemble!,"Overall, I really like this stand. It is true to color and easy to assemble. I have a large officejet all-in-one printer and it holds it well. I didn't have any problem with the legs, but the shelf was very obviously not cut in a straight line on one end. So, it was difficult to get the shelf to stay on at first. I made sure all the screws were tight and tried various positions for the shelf - I found one that fit tight and it will not fall out again. The shelf is currently holding about 8 reams of paper (letter & legal side by side)and could probably hold much more. The table is heavy enough to support my printer and I think it looks real nice. The space inside the drawer measures a little over 9.5"" wide, a little under 12"" deep, and 2.5"" height."
3,Happy with the product,"The product was packaged well and went together easily. The color and finish is very nice and true to the picture. The bottom shelf does not quit fit, but not very noticeable. Study enough for my big office jet!"
1,missing pieces and wrong holes made by company,"The wrong screws were sent, the holes for the shelf are not in the right place and there were missing washers with no directions included,"
2,fair to poor,"This is the second piece I purchased out of the Winsome collection. The first one was damaged during shipping, and Amazon sent me a new one right away. This one has a big scratch on top right out of the box, and sanding/finish were done half fast at best. very spotty on varnish, and very rough texture in some areas. I needed this, so I didn't return it because it is mostly for work, not a show piece. Assembly was very easy."
4,Nice Solid Wood - Easy to Assemble,"Once the package arrived at my office I knew this must be real solid wood since the box was a lot heavier than what I was expecting. The packaging was a mess inside with crushed Styrofoam and cardboard everywhere, but there were no scratches, dents, or dings on any of the wood itself. There aren't that many parts to worry about - the top piece with drawer already assembled, the shelf, 4 legs, the drawer knob, and a bag of screws/bolts. Assembly took about 30 minutes and it would have been quicker but I wasn't paying attention and ended up not lining up the holes for the shelf correctly. Make sure that the holes for the shelf are pointing the correct way to save yourself some time.All in all it's a nice looking sturdy table that was easy to assemble and nicely holds our printer and computer without any problems."
2,Solid construction but poor quality control,"The table seems sturdy enough, but the quality of the finish is less than the quality that comes out of an introductory wood shop class. Several of the pieces were missing varnish in various spots, and some of the pieces had large sections that weren't sanded. Luckily, I was able to display the table in a way that hid all these flaws. The bottom shelf that came with mine does not match the one in the picture on Amazon. The one I got is not as refined. It is slapped together and the center portion is dark brown."
2,Parts Not Right,"Love this item but unfortunately I can't use the bottom shelf, the pre-manufactured holes on the legs were only right on 2 of them and the other two were on the outside making it impossible to put the shelf in. I had already taken it apart 3 times and was not going to take it apart again just to ship it back. Other than that, it is a great looking piece of furniture"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IS JUNK,"ARRIVED WITH A CRACKED LEG, AND THE BOX WAS TORN OPENTERRIBLE CONDITION! JUNK"
4,Great Toy But Disappointed,"We bought this toy for my son who just turned 4. I was lucky enough to be able to buy MANY pieces of Rokenbok for 70% off at a local store. I got everything but the starter set. I read that this set was compatible with other Rokenbok so I chose this one because the age seemed more appropriate. The problem is that this set does NOT come with the control pad and the ""keys"" to put in the vehicles. It works just like other remote toys with batteries in both the controller (which is different) and the vehicle. Now I have a starter set that will not work with all the other pieces that I have, which means more money to invest to get the controller and keys. The toy is great, but you can't add it to other sets with vehicles."
2,"Kids ignore it, crane soon broke","This seemed like a very cool toy to me. But neither my 3.5 year old boy who LOVES trucks nor my 5 year old boy really spent much time with it. After 7 months collecting dust, I put new batteries in it in a bid to re-spark their interests, but the crane is dead. It's not totally worthless without a crane, but half the functionality is gone."
4,Challenging fun read for non-readers,"This book was written as part of a series for esl or non reading adults to provide some adult topics while expanding reading skills. If you are a reader and bought it to learn about the subject, you will be dissapointed. If you bought it for a youngster to improve on skills and provide an action topic, you may be more pleased. All my grandkids have a copy, because I am in it....."
2,Become an Internet Millionaire,This book is for anyone that is curious ( ind a general way)about how network marketing works. The book concentrates more on the network marketing aspects than the featured topic of Skybiz 2000. It's an interesting book for those people who are fed up with their same old job. If you are interested in a new way to make money this book gives you a general option. The only element really missing from this book is substance. Pete has an engaging style and gets you excited about the posibilities but when you wade through the excitement you are left wondering what Skybiz and the book are really about.
1,Oddly,"Oddly, the FIVE star reviews are by: one person who has written only ONE review and another who calls himself A CUSTOMER but has no link. They both sound very slick and commercial. Doesn't this make you wonder?"
2,A thriller with offensive language and casual sex.,I love a good mystery. Ms. Coulter's plots will keep you turning the pages. However I became tired of constantly having to skip over all the offensive language. I have decided NOT to read any more of Catherine Coulter's books (I read 6) because I am offended by her use of God and Jesus as curse words. There are hundreds of other things her characters could say to show shock and anger. In Hemlock Bay sexual relations was treated with no more thought than where to eat lunch.
4,"Works, but on an incline","This product looks great, winds the watches, basically everything that's advertised. 2 minor problems prevented the 5-star rating: 1) it is reasonably quiet, but not totally silent. This is mostly a non-issue though as I have to concentrate to pick it out of the background noise in my room. 2)It didn't seem to be winding the watches enough. When I watched them go round, the winding weight was either not going through a full turn, or it would get stuck and as a result the mainspring would wind down. As a solution I put the back legs on an incline (PC DVD box) and it works just like its supposed to now. Oh, and I had to put something over the top because the power LED was keeping me up, but I'm pretty sensitive to light.Overall I'd buy it again."
4,A cool drop of water in the depths of hell,"This album has a more positive outlook concerning love than the usual woefulness that most albums of this genre portray. If you want a break from what you are used to listening to, you may wanna give this one a chance."
2,don't do it,this bag looks nice. it's actually very large with an extremely cheap nylon changing pad. one thing i didn't consider was the fact that it is canvas and will take on any color that you are wearing. one side of my bag is dark blue from my jeans. the insulation tore on the outside pockets. it is too large to fit into the under carraige of my eddie bauer travel system. and the inside is just a gaping hole. i am not happy with it at all and am currently looking into buying a backpack diaper bag.
4,Pretty good,It's a good back. Neutral colors so dad and mom can feel comfortable with it. It's pretty roomy and comfortable to carry. I've had it for 9 months and noticed it began to tear at one of the strap seams but either than that I have no complaints.
5,return to simplicity,"This very enjoyable cd comes at a fair price, it runs 45 minutes and is relaxing and enjoyable, it achieves its purpose."
4,"Don't expect to smell castor oil, but...","M. v.Richthofen may well end up being a boring Hero. Disciplined, methodical, practical...and opportunistic, The Red Baron's airplane and title were more exciting than the ""real"" man. Kilduff plays it for history, not drama. No sex scandals, no rakish behavior, no grandstanding, no arrogance - The Red Barron was simply a guy who decided to be good at his job of killing other people with his airplanes - at least that's how Kilduff records him.Based on history, Kilduff is probably right on, too. Nevertheless, don't let the warning of ""dryness"" scare away. Kilduff brings to light many interesting, periodic details that will tickle aviation, history and general readers alike. Surely, this book is worth buying - for self or as a gift. Just don't expect Sagittarius Rising - now THAT is a WW1 story (but no where near as legendary).Credit goes to Kilduff for telling it like it is. Thank you."
4,The whole history of the Red Baron !,"Kilduff gives us, in this great book, not only an account of Richthofen exploits, but a general view of air combat in World War II. Deeply researched and rich with actual facts, this is a must-buy book for any real afficionate of air combat."
2,Way too much fluff,"I am not a scientist, but in past years I've enjoyed the stretch of reading the ""best"" series. I have counted on really good, meaty articles that offered up some of the most interesting and stimulating thinking about science and nature to be brought within the reach of readers like me.Not so this year. The majority of the articles in this anthology are simply entertainment. A superficial personality piece about James Watson. An article about trends in baby names. Etc. This is waiting room material--good for passing time, but not for learning or provoking thought.Normally, I only bother to write reviews when a book is so wonderful I want to encourage others to read it. But this one was such a letdown, I wanted to take the trouble to warn others away. I don't know if the editors just made bad selections this year, or if the material they included really WAS the best of 2004. If the latter, it's a scary thought!"
5,The Queen of Jazz vocal,"Carmen has long been my all time favorite jazz vocalist. Like most musicians, their best recordings are live. Live at Sugar Hill is Carmen's best. This was recorded when she was at the top of her game with great backup musicians. I had the original vinyl and was ecstatic to find it had finally been re-mastered for a CD."
2,Not sure about these,"If your planning on buying tools like these you might want to make sure who you get them from. I was happy enough to have these for their many uses BUT they looking over used and even too worn. So if your looking for quality tools, and a quality place to get them, email the company and do your research. Its a good deal if the tools were in a great shape, but you get what you pay for and these by no means are worth it. I suggest in a pinch find a local art retailer, better yet a good mom and pop deal and go there for tools like these."
4,Love the footnotes and asides,"For now the only thing I can say is that I breezed through the Regular Expressions chapters in one night. Learned nearly all I had to learn about that most important facet of programming from this book. Glad I did because I just donwloaded VIM text editor and can now use regular expressions to do searches on my documents. I've also begun using regular expressions in JavaScript. Thought it was such a formidable subject when I encountered it the first time around in JS. Piece of cake. Thanks to the Llama book.If you don't learn Perl from this book, you'll at least enjoy the jokes and asides that are practically on every page."
5,Rare entertainment in a programming book,"This book is a well-paced intoduction to Perl. They cover sticking points like ""context"" (which is how Perl is so free flowing) to the point where you are dam(n) sure to have it straight. Short examples highlight everything, and the lessons it comes with (with explanations at the back) are a very, very nice touch.As a bonus, it's funny and engagingly written. Follow this one up with Programming Perl, the much faster paced 'mother book' of Learning Perl."
2,Not The Best,"This book _is_:-funny-relatively concise-a decent book on the languageThis book _is not_:-good for the beginning perl programmer.Basically, this book tries to cover too much in some areas and not nearly enough of some other topics. Hashes get their own chapter, but it's miniscule. On the other hand, the intricacies of dealing with list v. scalar context are covered in depth. From personal experience, however, hashes are one of the most useful features of perl.My suggestion: start with perlmonks.org and the Camel. Between the two of them, you'll find everything you need to know."
4,From a grateful beginner...,"A friend of mine, ever anxious that I become a Perl girl, bought me this book. After going through the first half of it, I am actually beginning to conclude that programming is relatively painless...Schwartz and Phoenix start slow. *Really* slow. I knew a very few Unix commands before opening this book, but that's it. No other programming languages, nothin'. Despite my lack of background, I found ""Learning Perl"" easy to read, the examples doable, thus keeping me from giving up. (Which, I assure you, I would've done had this been difficult.)So, my guess is that if you already have a smattering of programming, this book may progress too slowly for your taste. But for the absolute beginner, it's great."
3,For the beginner only?,"Some reviewers have said that this book is for newbies only, and I have made that assertion myself. I've recently rethought that assertion. I would recommend this book for any programmer coming from another language to perl. Learning Perl takes common programming idioms and expresses them in ""perlish"" terms. I've learned when training folks to use perl, to send them to the llama book first, then the camel, then the ram. (Learning Perl, Programming Perl, Perl Cookbook). The book is full of examples, but unlike most programming books, it's readable. In true O'Reilly style the book is informative and fun. It's great, and I highly recommend it for anyone learning programming, or learning perl for the first time."
4,good,"I read this book a while ago although I havent played in Perl for a long time this is a great book. If your on a linux/unix based system its even better as I feel its aimed highly towards it since a lot of examples are based on *nix programs such as grep, awk.I had experience with PHP, so learning the first few chapters were extremely easy (and even without it the text is easy going so it doesnt push you too quickly), it doesnt go over the top by trying to teach radical things like OO and also has a few commonly used Modules you can use.One good explained topic was Regular Expressions. Ive always found them hard even for a simple expression, however my understanding has greatly improved although I still consider myself a novice with it, it does get explained extremely well.Overall this is a good book, I didnt find any typos too my knowledge and all the examples that I did worked. Some of the exercises were quite hard though."
4,Great Introduction to Perl,"I did not have any previous programming experience before reading this book, just a bit of dealing with Unix. After reading it I was able to create useful programs which I had been wishing for. Some topics seem a little out of place, I do not understand why the chapter on subroutines is so early. Learning is a bit rough with no programming experience, but worth the work. I think of this as the language introdution by which all others are measured."
3,Decent learning book,"I have seen Perl before, but never could understand other people's code. I got this book to help me get a leg up on Perl. Generally I liked to book. I think the author went way overboard on footnotes. Footnotes should give more detailed info or where to look for more info. He used his for editorial comments. Also, I thought some of the topics got fired at you in odd places. For instance, the introduction of 'my' to define a local variable, got shoved in way late in a place not really relevant.Generally, I found the book useful on understanding Perl and how it works. I will need the Perl book now for a reference."
5,"Finally, a programming book I can learn from!!","For the last couple years I have aimlessly wandered from one perl book to another and gotten nowhere. Not being a programmer many of the books were just too hard to follow or intoduced too many concepts at one time in a way that made absolutlely no sense. But today, I picked up the llama book and that all changed. After only a couple hours, I had already written some useful (very simple) programs without, and I repeat without having to refer back to the book. Not only that, I cannot wait to read the next chapter, I am totally jazzed. Thank you Randal L. Schwartz."
5,great for starters,"If you do not know PERL at all. Start here. You bet you're gonna learn how to start programming in PERL. At times this may might assume you know atleast some programming language, but generally it is very basic."
3,Average,"It covers the basics, but the author's have a poor writing style which includes a lot of wandering and bad jokes."
5,Hands down the BEST on the Market!!,"I have yet to find another tool by any manufacturer that impresses me as much as Bosch tools, they have the best tools in the industry. I'm impressed everytime I use these tools. Highly recommended!"
4,Learning How to Give it so They get it,"How to give it so they get it is a good user friendly manual. This book has given me a plan to follow which will ensure my training sessions will become motivational and memorable. I have always lent toward the active learning style and now I have another reference book to refer. 'If you want them to HEAR it , you talk. If you want them to LEARN it , they talk.'"
3,Yet another Learning Styles Model!,"Sharon Bowman has come a long way. This is one of her early books. A more recent bookThe Ten-Minute Trainer: 150 Ways to Teach it Quick and Make it Stick! (Pfeiffer Essential Resources for Training and HR Professionals)is SO much better.This one is modeled on the metaphor of a flight plan, and gets a tad hokey. She also introduces a new learning style analysis, which I found to be pretty weak. She does have some great ideas in here, (which are also repeated in the new book) and as a trainer, you can never miss out on new ideas.Sharon is a creative professional and teaches participatory learning. She uses a lot of creative techniques, and writes her books in the style she teaches people to use. Active learning creates retained information and a fun experience. For the money, you're better off with The Ten Minute Trainer."
1,A book for Kindergarten teachers/,"According to the author, ""During a college history class, the instructor held up a shoe and said, 'How is American history like this shoe?'""That college instructor should have been fired. No wonder American education is producing students who are illiterate. I teach developmental classes in reading and study skills to adults who were failed by the system. Teachers who use methods like the ones in this book set up their students for failure.I agree that the old fashioned lecture methods do not work 100 percent of the time, but there is still a lot to be said for reading and studying and putting some real effort into the learning process.While I play Jeopardy with my students and give them lots of opportunities for feedback and self study, the methods in this book insult anyone over the fifth grade."
4,Good Book - Bad Title,"Alright, there isn't a 3.5 and I feel like being nice. I agree with all of the reviews on this page in some way.If you are looking for a 'WORD' book, look elsewhere, this book is for programmers.That said, if you are looking for a 'VBA' book, this isn't a good one either - unless you are looking for advanced-specific project information.What the book covers it covers very well. Like some others, I bought it thinking it might cover something different, but.... There are some very ingenious code snippets in here, and if you're deep into Word, you might find some answers here.This book just tries to be too advanced. If it were longer and covered some of the basics it could be great. Instead, they chose to offer a book for people who were already VBA/Word experts. It's well worth the money if this is what you are looking for."
1,A Worthless Book,"Can you imagine a book on Word VBA automation that doesn't have the word ""print"" in its so-called index? This is such a book. Nor has it ""printer,"" ""printing,"" or anything like that.Word 2000 is useful for e-mail through MAPI but this book never mentions e-mail.When it comes to objects such as the Document, all Scott does is list properties, methods and events. He doesn't even bother to list or explain the arguments used with the object's methods.You can learn a lot more about Word VBA from the VBA object browser than you can from this book. Don't waste your time and money."
2,Disappointing,This book is a disappointment to me. Much of the material is glossed-over. Very few complete examples. I wouldn't bother with this. The Word 2000 help file is more useful.
3,Well written book but no real good examples,"Well, I like many of the other people writing reviews here bought this book because frankly there are not a lot of Word VBA book out in the market. I have to say first that the way the book is organized and written was well done. That's why I gave 3 stars. However, I would've liked to have seen more descriptions on many of the methods the book glosses over. In short, it's a good reference but really the help file is just as good."
2,Good pulse monitor except when wet,"This is a good one piece pulse monitor, and accurate (tested it against a Blood Pressure Monitor and gave the same reading). While running, just put your index and thumb on the pads and in a couple of seconds you'll get your pulse rate. The problem is that when it gets wet (or even humid), the pulse monitor starts by itself which overrides the button functions or any other thing. Anyways I still use it to monitor my pulse, but I use another stopwatch for laps counting and timing."
5,WOW!,"Wow!!! A good friend of mine turned me on to this group which I never heard of before called,""The RAH BAND"". He passed on two songs of theirs, one called, ""Clouds Across The Moon"" & the other ""Messages From The Stars"". He knows I like music that's not pop top 40, so with that said I listen the these two songs he turned me onto & I just love them! What a nice surprise, to hear music that was fun, dreamy, & with good vibrations. So, I decided to purchase the best Of The RAH Band & I was so pleasantly surprised. Each track is just as good as the last. I would strongly recommend this cd if u like music with sort of a soft, dreamy, dance, pop rock, glam, 80's sound. I am very happy with my purchase!"
1,Doesn't work pieces fly everywhere,Installed and first time I used the trimmer head the parts flew everywhere. Not sure if it was defective or not but the design doesn't even look to be any better than the OEM head that came with the trimmer. I returned it for a refund.
2,Easily broken,"When using this trimmer head, do not let the lobes (4 per head) where the string is loaded strike any hard surface. The lobes break easily. Otherwise, the unit works as advertised."
2,Be warned - do some due diligence before buying,"If you own a curved-shaft trimmer, this product may not be what you are really looking for.If you have a straight-shaft trimmer, this will indeed serve as a true replacement head. But, with most curved shaft trimmers, the installation instructions for this product require you to leave the original trimmer head base plate on the trimmer. If you don't HAVE the original trimmer head, this product will not work for you.Given this is called a ""replacement head"", you may be surprised by that - I certainly was."
5,Awesome...,"This product works as advertised. I have a new Homelite gas trimmer with a curved shaft and what used to take me nearly a full ""roll"" of line with the old bump and feed method I did with only two 5 inch pieces. I had to ""rig"" the end of it a little to make the retro-fit tight on the the head of the trimmer but other than that, this is the easiest and best product I have ever used for trimming. I highly recommend this product if you have a lot to trim like I do as it will save you a ton of time and even more frustration."
4,More cutting less changing,"Used a pre-loaded spool for years. I hated the the whole process of advancing new line. Like this product. Line is tough, cuts OK.Line change is quick and simple. Stop. Load. Cut."
3,instructions,"tried installing it but directions were sparseended up breaking part of my weed eater, directions sayrefer to your mfg. info, well if I had that info,andthe mfg. had included the intructions to install it...."
2,Did NOT Work,This item quickly installed with little hassle. but it had my trimmer acting like a broken down old car. The string kept flying out of the holes that were supposed to securely keep them in. They should say what kind of trimmers this will work with.
1,Don't buy it,No stars if it would let me. It cracked the first time I used it. Won't hold ont the string anymore.
1,it works . . . but,"This device was easy to install on my Ryobi Gas trimmer and it works as advertised, except, when you turn the timmer vertically to cut an edge, the Load N cut trimmer line inserts vaporize.It took me almost one whole package to use my trimmer vertically and finish my corner yard. it works very well when used horizontally, however . . . I can't edge like that.I've got a few more inserts and then when they' goner I'm gonna buy another brand, probably the Pivotrim."
2,Doesn't work with Stihl,"Though Stihl is listed as compatible with the Grass Gator, I couldn't make it work with my Stihl model without physically altering it (the Grass Gator- not the trimmer) and that seemed like too much trouble. Pay attention when they say it works with 99% of trimmers -- your's, like mine, might be one of the 1%."
2,"Easy to load, but cracked after 3 uses","I bought this for my Stihl FS-106. The trimmer head is super easy to load, however, after 3 uses, I found that it cracked, and it kept throwing trimmer line. I guess I need to get a metal head instead."
3,String falls out,The head came with four strings installed and they all were gone before I could finish trimming my small lot. I bought heavier replacement strings and one came out before I even started trimming the yard. I have a 4 cycle gas trimmer and thought the extra vibration may be creating the problem. Last week I was very careful to not rev the engine too much and the strings were still in place when I finished the yard. Hopefully this solved the problem.
5,Amazinag book about BEING and being Jewish.,"This is a very quick read, hard to put down, wonderful book by an amazing Rabbi. It will connect you wherever you need connecting, ground you, lift you, enlighten you, and I assure you, give you at least one ""AHA"" moment. JG, Chicago"
5,Lost Prophet,An excellent biography about one of the unsung heroes of the American Civil Rights movement. Well written and annotated footnotes for fact junkies.
4,lost prophet,Book is well researched and sympathetic to Rustin and his life. The sections on his relationship to Martin Luther King and Bayard's homosexuality were helpful.
1,It is broken after one month useage,"I bought it because a magnize rate it as Best Buy. But, I believe it is the Worst Buy. It is broken just after one month. I used it at most 1o times. No more than 30 minutes. The motor stops running.It is warranty for ecchnage. But, unlike others (just cut the plug with with some # on it), it asks me to ship the whole blender for exchange. I bought it for $35, In order to ship the broken item, I ahve to pay extra $15 shipping fee. It makes it very expensive.As for uasge, it only good for blending liquid not for ice. It is unable to crach big block of ice."
2,"High hopes, not so high results.","Worked well for awhile, then silicone gaskets in the blade assembly came out and liquads started seeping out all over the place"
2,It's ok I guess,This book is not what is expected if you are looking for information try something else this has nothing to do with spells or spell craft
3,Something to make you earn,"When listening to the remixes on this single, I couldn't help but earn to hear Iron and Wine's cover of the song."
3,"Postal Service, The - We Will Become Silhouettes","The Postal Service always teeters on the edge of being too twee... and _We Will Become Silhouettes_ showcases this fine line. The light glitchiness help leaven Gibbard's lyric, which themselves walk the line of precious and meaningful. ""Be Still My Heart"" grounds itself with a deeper bassline to counterbalance the sweet, if silly, romantic tendencies. Styrofoam, in his own work, has leaned increasingly on vocalists, and on his mix of ""Nothing Better,"" adds an appealing crunciness to the track. Matthew Dear takes on ""We Will Be Become Silhouettes"" by stripping out the rhythm except for a click track and filling the background with broken, disembodied voices -- a surprise, considering how much rhythm plays into his own work -- but here, it supplies a nice contrast to the original."
4,"Good opera, well performed","This opera of Meyerbeer's early days got a bad rap from a reviewer for whom I have nothing but the utmost respect. You will find that review on Classics Today which I consult several times a day. Compared to Robert Levine my knowledge of music and opera is nil and his is vast, and so I am going to chalk this up to a difference in taste. Frankly I bought this item because I enjoy Meyerbeer's music and I couldn't resist the price. After reading Mr. Levine's review I must say I was more than pleasantly surprised. This opera is not great but it is good and pleasurable to listen to. I find the singers and particularly the soprano to have extremely fine voices. I am enjoying this opera immensely and recommend it unreservedly, not just to Meyerbeer fans but to all who like early 19th century opera."
3,"Good, but could be better...","I personnally think this CD could be better than it is...why? because the dj,soul slinger, fails to realize that the material is not his best,and knows deep down that...He Could Do Better."
1,The worst dvd ever!,"I am really desapointed with this dvd... the only good part is the visual one... If you want a good electronic music dvd, choose Tiesto I and II, Underworld, UMF Experience, FatBoySlim Big Beach Boutique II, Moby Play, Groove Armada... not this one! Otherwise you will be watching Sasha & Digweed on the road only, talking and talking and talking...."
3,Delta Heavy is light on the good stuff,"I'll admit I had a tough time trying to get my hands on this DVD. No where in Calgary was carrying it and Amazon.com is giving me a hard time with ordering items right now.Well in any case I loved the presentation and gloss on this DVD package. The shine, spit and polish it top notch. However after a short journey it ended! I felt a little robbed at the length and was hoping for a more in-depth adventure with Sasha and John Digweed.The special features are also a bit lacking in the meat and bones department. The deleted scenes, in my opinion they should have left them in the main feature!! The track selection is rather boring but the songs themselves are gold.I love Sasha and John Digweed. I have a `large' collection of Northern Exposure and GU CDs. I just wish there was more to this than the bare bones feature.Hopefully there will be another feature sometime with both DJs that will satisfy us all more so then this Delta Heavy outing."
2,Not for the music,"Let me say right out that Sasha and Digweed are fantastic DJs, each in their own right, and that the Delta Heavy tour was an epic experience. Unfortunately, this DVD does not pack the expected punch of the actual performance. Make no mistake, this is NOT a concert footage DVD. Instead you will find interviews galore detailing the logistics and documenting the events surrounding the Delta Heavy tour. The music, for the most part, is not even live. Too much talk, waste of money. Pick up Sasha's Involver or Digweed's Fabric instead, forget the DVD."
3,Pretty Average L/S T-Shirt,"Sizes run a bit large, vinyl applied graphics a bit disappointing, but at $19.99, fair quality for the price."
5,awesome!,"so glad i found and bought this. watched it as a kid and now with my daughter, who loves it too."
5,Great Video Set!!!,"Honestly, the quality of these videos is MUCH better than the episodes you can find on share sites AND it has ALL the Jem and the Holograms episodes that were played on tv. My kids all LOVE Jem, and they watch these episodes over and over. The series has a great storyline that is intricate enough to keep even adults interested, and adventurous enough to keep the attention of a toddler (that is quite a feat, as this particular toddler is VERY ACTIVE!)Thank you Shout! factory for releasing Jem and the Holograms complete series on DVD!"
5,GREAT!!,Item perfect. Great Price. LOVE LOVE LOVE this cartoon. Been wanting for a long time but didn't want to pay a high price. This was perfect! Thanks
5,Love this show,I used to watch this show when I was little and now that it started coming on the hub...my daughters have fell in love with it. Definitely worth the money
5,Can't get enough,"My six year old daughter and i love watching these videos together. Age appropriate for both of us. She and i love the complicated lives of these beautiful, talented philanthropists. I feel that instead of deadening the human part of my little princess with violence like southpark and adding sarcasm to her brain with shows like family guy, these videos teach her to think highly of herself and others.Jem has to overcome swindlers everyday in the modern business world while loving her friends, being faithful to the love of her life, and balancing work and play."
4,Only downfall to the complete set...,"The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because I already have the other two releases from Rhino; all I really needed was the last DVD with the remaining episodes/seasons. Sigh...guess I'll just have to buy the new complete box set. I used to love this series as a kid.ETA: Received my set 10/13 and only had time to watch a few episodes. Definitely disappointed by the quality as compared to the Rhino sets. I'm still happy to have the whole series though.My four star rating still stands...and this time based on product quality. Although my I stand behind my 4 star from before...everytime I see this set, I'm slightly bitter I had to buy the whole she-bang just to get the ""last"" season's worth of shows."
5,Memories,"A great show, as great as I remember. My 7yr old and I enjoy watching it together. Great songs you can sing along to."
5,Totally awesome!,Loved these shows as a kid. Bought em to share with my daughters. This box set is sturdy and doesn't look cheap! I received it sooner than delivery time. Very impressed!
5,Feel like I'm 10 years old all over again!!!!,"Oh my gosh! I can't believe Jem and the Holograms is out on DVD!!! This was my favorite cartoon growing up as a young girl! I am so buying this for my future daughter, and, alright, totally for myself!!! Jem is Completely Outrageous! For anyone who hasn't seen Jem, you should defiantely watch an episode and you will be hooked...its about your average girl next door who goes secretly transforms into Jem who is WOW and gorgeous and can sing with her Holograms...love story too because both her girl next door self and her outrageous self is in love with the same guy and he is as well not knowing they are the same girl! Great music! I give this 10 out of 10 stars! I can't wait to watch!!!!!"
3,COMPLETE but SUB-PAR QUALITY,"OK, first off - I am EXTREMELY grateful that SHOUT put out this complete set for us fans. However, I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the transfers. The video quality looks as if they just dubbed straight from the VHS tapes. I have an expensive set-up with HDMI, etc. so I know its not my hardware. The RHINO releases are far superior in quality in every way. RHINO had better menus, graphics and tons of extras, etc. Its a shame they never got around to releasing the few final episodes of season 3. Oh well, I guess for us completists - this set is better than nothing."
4,Jem and the Holograms - The Truly Outrageous Complete Series,"It's a great item, the only thing I disapprove is that the commercial breaks haven't been cut out. If they were, I would have rated the item with *****."
2,Jem is outrageous....This set isnt.,"Yes Jem is still awesome after all these years. However except for the fact this has the second half of the third season (not released before), this set is fair. I'm very happy I hung on to my Rhino released set.My biggest disappointment here was the sound quality. Initial marketing for this release stated it would have both a 5.1 or the optional 2.0 sound. Sadly the final product only has a 2.0. (The above fore mentioned Rhino set had 5.1). Alot of echoing throughout and just didnt sound good.The picture quality was OK, but again substandard to its predecessor. I agree with the review before, it reminds me of a cable network broadcast. Alot of faded colors here and there.If you are looking to complete the series on DVD, I would strongly urge you to wait and just purchase the third season when it comes out individually."
4,How about other countries?,"I have the Rhino set of DVDs and I just loved it. Still very upset because the second part of third season never came out. I can see this complete set has a lower quality, but at least I can have the missing episodes from the previous release. Now I wonder: will we ever have this with subtitling or dubbing in foreign languages? I'm not from States, I'm from Brazil and the show was a big success when aired in the past. Let me dream on that... :)"
3,Love one song on it thats why I bought it,"My favorite song on this alburm is ""A Heart Like Mine"" which is why I bought it. Now I can listen to it whenever I want."
4,Tempered with tempeh,"Some of the other reviews seem to be overly influenced by kind bud and the munchies.I found this book to be a nice collection of recipes of various offerings I saw in the lot. The stories were interesting too.This book wasn't mind blowing, but it lives up to what it claims to be. It's worthwhile if you want to try some of the things you missed after Soldier Field."
4,great and original!!,"great recipes!!! vegan galore!! captures the feeling of the shows!! such a great original idea....also check out ""made with love"" more great recipes....and ideas!"
