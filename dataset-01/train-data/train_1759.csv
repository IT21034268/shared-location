3,"Good, but the trailer was better","after being a fan of the first Ironman, as was really looking forward to Ironman 2. The trailer made it look like a great sequel to a great movie. In the end, not what i expected. though special effects were great (in the few parts they were used) action scenes were few and far between. watch the trailer for this movie about 5 times and thats more action than this movie had. the final battle between ironman and lightning whip (a man who laughed at the thought of ironman the entire movie) lasted no more than 2 minutes. the bar fight between Downey and Cheadle was longer than that.i wouldnt have cared so much about the lack of action if the movie had been shorter."
3,Must-See For One Line Only,"This line, spoken by TONY STARK'S COMPUTER: ""Congratulations, sir -- you have created a new element."" LOLz."
2,Not as good as the first,"In my opinion this movie was nowhere as good as the first movie. The changes they made to his chest reactor really upset me. I remember sitting in the theater and saying out loud ""what the hell?"" And the change in his overall attitude and personality from the first movie was also a let down. In my opinion the only part of the movie that truly excited me was the scene with the suitcase suit."
4,Better get the Blu Ray...,"The movie's great and fantastic, something people of all ages could enjoy. The sex-tone is lowered a bit from the fist one, and a good bit of plots from the comic book from which this is based are compacted in this movie. My only problem is with the second disk. The special features are nice, but just that... ""nice"". Nothing really spectacular, and the Blu Ray version is supposed to be more complete. Besides, the BR comes with the DVD, and since we all know DVDs will be gone in a few years, you could get your own BR version so you don't have to copy again later. It feels like falling for Blu Ray even if you're not prepared for it (with all the gadgets made for it) but that's the way this business is like."
4,iron man 2,"Although I heard this one wasn't as good as the 1st. one, I thought it was.Action packed and Robert Downey Jr. was superb as usual. I really enjoyed the movieand will watch it again in the future."
1,Item didn't play,"Not only did the disk not work, it is now stuck inside my player. I have to take my player to a repair shop and PAY to have the disk removed."
1,Garbage!! Terrible!! Rip-Off!!,"Movie was not what was promised! Froze every 10-15 mins, had to keep replaying. Would and will never buy from this seller ever again!! Do not use or trust this seller, they will rip you off!!!"
1,You don't own this if you buy through unbox,You cannot burn this to a DVD if you buy it from Unbox. DRM prevents your true ownership.
3,Not as good as it was hyped.,The writers on this one must think Tony Stark was a moron. It was Okay; I just don't care for shows that make the Hero out to be an idiot.
3,Blu-Ray Review,"Not even close to the first one. Plot was totally dumb. Just like Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen, Dumb. There will be a third one too."
2,really?,"Just to make this short. First Iron man was amazing. The second one was blah.There was nothing exciting.They just added more bad guys and more boom.Where was the story that pulled you in or make you go:""noooo way"".. it just lacked in that deparment.The effects were really well put together.music was good and just the sound effects overall were really good.The second one definetly has more humurous scenes and cheesy twistsIf you're going to make sequel, atleast try to get the same cast members to be in the second one.The new replacement didn't really make the movie better.it just didn't fit in.The movie is just cheesy(not spoiling)a Third one? wahts it going to have? more robots then the second one? every gadget going to be pocket size?not really looking foward to seeing the third one."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I must admit that this was my first movie in this genre for many years. However, I found the plot to be boringly predictable, the acting is overdone and the story line was so far outside the realm of plausibility that it was impossible to connect with it at almost any level. On top of that, there is just not much about the characters that makes you want to either like them or dislike them. I couldn't finish it."
4,Llego exactamente un dia antes de los que prometieron,"compre este video desde peru, y llego un dia antes de lo que prometieron, muy bien enpacado. Lo reomiendo, estoy satisfecho."
2,A sequel that falls short,this movie without a doubt was a huge dissapointment.I heard a rumor before the movie even came out to theatres that it was suppose to be as good as a sequel like the the dark knight was to batman begins.That was a lie Iron man 2 starts out good showing what has progressed since the first movie and entices us with an awesome battle at a race track with whiplash but falls flat after that.The movie should have been called tony stark instead of iron man 2 because he was iron man about only 3 times or 4x in the movie. The first iron man is better and has moaction than the sequel which is ridiculous.But the acting overall was good and scarlett johansen fight at the last 15 minutes in the movie was very well choregraphed and executed. A 2 star sequel could have been more but didnt accomplish what the film the dark knight directed by Christopher nolan did.
2,"Speedy, but not at all quality",•An explanation for what you liked or disliked about the product- The case and product looked like a child wrestled with it a few times and then it got sold to•Product pros and cons- the pros the shipment was quick but the cons was the DVD was not worth the sellers price•Facts and feature details- DVD case was extremely beat and the dvd had scratches and the seller did not mention these flaws•Comparisons to similar products- I usually get my product through another seller and they are quick and the disk are spotless
2,"great for 6 year old boys, adults kind of boring! very little charachter development and very obvious speical effects a no go","great for 6 year old boys, adults kind of boring! very little charachter development and very obvious speical effects a no go"
5,awesome,"Movie is beast mode from the start to finish. Hot chicks, fast cars, and ass kicking. It's great! I highly recommend this film."
3,Not as good as the first,I thought the movie was great overall but I also thought it was a little cheesy in some parts. Robert Downey Jr. was great as usual but I did not like the fact that Don Cheadle replaced Torrence Howard. Not sure why that was but I really dislike when they change out actors for the same characters. I definitely thought the first one was better and I have high hopes for the third.
3,Kind of a let down,"The first Iron Man was excellent especially the portion of it in the cave. There are a lot of good parts in the sequel such as the fight in Monaco when Tony is trying avoid Mickey Rourke's electric whips but this movie just feels rushed. The central relationship conflict between Tony and Pepper could have been solved with a simple conversation of 1 sentence; I hate when movies do this. ""Hey Pepper, my arc reactor is slowly killing me and I need to find a new element to use."" There. I just saved the plot 2 hours of bickering between Tony and Pepper. There is a lot of Avengers-building shoved into this film when they probably should have focused on the story. The fight at the end becomes sheer CGI porn and I lose interest. Definitely a step down from the 1st."
4,Funny,"I bought this film because I liked the first one. And right so: I had to laugh several times. This is all movies are about I suppose. If I want to cry just let me watch the news from Washington, DC."
5,Iron Man 2,"I have allways liked movies like this. Iron man 2 is just another great movie. I love tony stark in this one, you see a more human side in him"
3,Fun Flick,"Used to read these Marvel comics as a kid and the Iron Man movies are a great trip back in time and are a lot of fun to watch. Downey fits the role well. Special effects are very good, lots of action and an easy to understand plot.What fun."
4,Iron Man 2,Iron Man 2 is an action packed movie sequel. It has some really great special effects. It is a story of friendship and also a love story.
4,Better The Second Time Around At Home,"When I saw this sequel in the theatre I was disappointed. I felt the second movie lacked the charm and simple entertainment of the first movie. When the second movie was in the theatre we saw it once as a family, then my son and I saw it again. We saw the first movie a 3rd time at the drive-in. When the video came out for the first movie we purchased it on opening day of release and we have watched it countless times since then. However one viewing in the theatre of this movie was enough for me and as well our son. Still, we tend to get the video releases of movies of this type when they come available but we kind of put this on the back-burner. When this went on-sale as a blu-ray release we picked it up for Christmas in October but I couldn't wait to watch it so we opened it up and watched it at home. It was much better the second time and we have watched it several times since."
3,cool movie,A good superhero movie (Unlike the Dark knight which is a great superhero movie.) that suffers from a disjointed storyline with Ironman getting drunk. I believe this takes away from the superhero image. I also found this story very similar to the first movie. Can they make an Ironman movie where he does not fight himself or a villian similar to him. Where is the Mandarin when you need him?
3,"nice special effects, but little more than a formula flick without soul","This a pretty much the same film as Iron Man 1: Stark is out of control, but has a good heart and is trying to be a better person in spite of his celebrity. Pepper is the straight one, trying to hold it together. And then, there is a serious baddie who has mastered a technology that threatens Iron Man, allied with an industrialist/rival whose inferiority is matched only by his evil nature. Slam bang boom.Recommended as passtime fun, definitely for the background."
3,Decent,"Iron Man 2... Hmm, well, I guess I'll just start by saying I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one. For one, the villain didn't feel fleshed out enough, felt kinda flat honestly. I also don't like how they changed actors for the role of Rhodey (think I spelled it right?), I hate when they change up actors like that. I didn't care for the story as much as the first one. I do like how they gave Black Widow a role, though, she was pretty great. I also like how it kinda shows a Thor-like cameo-thing at the end. It's a decent movie with some strong points, but not as good as the first one. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,A Mess.,"Rourke should of gotten more screen time. The story was all over the place. Felt like they were focusing on many other things besides Iron Man. Anyone else find the F/X not up to par with the 1st? Seemed rushed, maybe it's just me."
2,Could have been so much better,"I really enjoyed the first Iron Man movie, but this movie was pretty bad. There was way too much inane dialogue, and characters that were not needed except for Marvel to advertise their other upcoming movies. Scarlett Johanson phoned in her role, but who could blame her, there was no reason for the Black Widow in the movie, she hardly did anything. Samuel L Jackson, whom I love, was actually annoying as Nick Fury, not this fault though, really the writers fault for putting him in scenes when the movie didn't warrant it. Don Cheadle was OK but I missed Terrence Howard's charm. Sam Rockwell as Hammer was good though, and Mickey Rourke as Whiplash seemed terrific if only they had used him more! Paltrow and Downey were good but the movie was really slow moving and the fight scenes pretty sparse. Overall a big disappointment."
3,Blue ray,Value for money..happy to keep as a gift to my self for collection item movie.i also will recommend to my friend
5,great movie,"Great addition/continuation to the Iron Man movie. There are times I am disappointed with the sequel, but in this one - I was not.Recommend."
5,Best movie I've seen in a long time.,"I'm not a big fan of movies, but this is one of my favorites. To be honest, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was as sequels are rarely as good as the first, but I think this movie was better than the first Iron Man. Totally worth going to."
2,Dull!,"Boring! Action films should never be tedious, this one is a yawn. Two stars for ACDC soundtrack and Downey Jnr being Downey Jnr.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
1,Awful,"Iron Man 2 had some of the worst dialogue of recent memory. Characters often talked, but there was never an indication that a character might actually be listening. The conflict was forced and the plot loosely strung together - there was only some small redemption with a few solid action sequences."
3,Some Sequels Suck,"I saw Iron Man 1 - loved it. Robert Downey, fantastic actor; love him. Watched IM2 with great expectation. Big disappointment. It's ok, if you are really bored. Fight scene on the racetrack, good, but not long enoungh. Too much talk, disjointed plot and not enough action. The real action only kicked in towards the end; then it became a shoot fest; Real boys movie. Towards the end I felt like I was watching a computer game - ok for those who are into that kind of thing I guess. Perhaps if I had not seen the first one, might have enjoyed this more - but doubt it. But it's like, ""we made money on the first one, let's make a sequel"" attitude. I will not be seeing IM3 if it's made."
5,Iron Man,Second of the series I just liked to cartoon character and having purchased the first Iron Man I decided to get the series.Nothing special just fun to watch.
3,Includes previews?!?!,"I bought this for my wife as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. She likes Iron Man and Transformers. Go figure. Anyway, the Blu-ray looks and sounds very good played from a PS3 to a 50"" plasma. It's nice that it include DVD so we can watch it on our laptop computer. Minus two stars because it has previews on it. I tolerate previews on rentals, but I pay to own it specifically to watch it without distraction. All the other discs I've purchased recently don't have previews. So what gives?"
5,Flawless!,Great movie it has everything one needs action comedy drama and little hint of romanceYou cant say that is not awesomeBuy it and love itP.S jon favreau great job second time around
5,Great Movie,"Iron Man 2 is one of those rare films that's as good as if not better than the first film. I never read a lot of Iron Man comics, so I don't know how well they portrayed the characters and story VS the comics, but I really like how it was done. I thoroughly enjoy this film and recommend it to others who like superhero and action films."
4,Iron Man 2,A worthy sequel to the original with some added characters that enhanced the series. Robert Downey plays the main character with just the right amount of dry humor.
5,"Great movie, Great Price",I was happy to purchase the blue-ray version of Iron Man II. My family really enjoys marvels action movies and for the price this was a steal. Thanks so much!
5,top notch film very entraining and good special effects,this film is very entertaing and robert downey is believable as iron man you have a feeling you are there and part with the story line
1,Boring,"Like others have commented, this movie has a weak story line and dialogue. So many clichés. If I had been watching this alone, I would have turned it off. There was nothing surprising, nothing intriguing. Big disappointment in my venture into ""action films."" Even the fight scenes were pretty lame--no creativity."
3,Get's a C+,I loved IRONMAN 1 and really looked forward to this sequel. I was quite disappointed with Ironman 2.It didn't come close to being as entertaining as the first Ironman. Special effects were first rate ......... other than that it was a failure.
2,Iron Man 2,I was not able to enjoy this movie with my HTC Flyer tablet. Amazon should notice customer that Android tablet has not supported yet. Can I expect to get a refund from Amazon? Wish I could.
2,Weak Sequal,"Noisy. Blaring soundtrack. Excessive explosions. Tony Stark acting like a real horse's ___. Wasted footage on previously mentioned excessive explosions. Only surprise was the depth of Mickey Rourke's villianous character. Oh, and Scarlett Johansson can't act."
2,Ironed Out,"I was a big fan of the first Iron Man movie. On the second installment though, it seems they went for the blockbuster effect, but forgot that in the end its about the story. I found the plot a little meandering, esp. with the way they try to sequence Iron Man in with others from the Marvel Universe. I think that if they try to do a third installment, they should remember the first movie....and try to make it a interesting story, not just a money maker."
2,Not worth the money!,"The first Iron Man movie was the best comic book rendition ever done. The characters were right out of the comic books and the story left me wanting more (really cool). This second attempt was very disappointing and did not follow any of the iron man comic books. Revealing the real identity of Iron man painted a target on Tony Stark forever. In the first movie, Tony grows up and starts taking responsibility for his company. In the second movie Tony is less responsibile than he started out in the first movie and more after selfish glory. He turns over his responsibilities to others or they take them from him, and he pursues a life of selfish carelessness. The plot is not plausable or fun. I wouldn't know how to fix this series going forward. It is as if the writer was trying to end it here. It's really too bad because they had a great start in Iron Man 1."
3,too narrow,"The picture aspect of 2:35:1 is too narrow for acceptable viewing on a normal tv set , particularly if you have below average eyesight. If you zoom it in you miss too much of the peripheral action. It would be great if they could release 2 versions, one in 2.35:1 for those who like this format and one in 1.77:1 or 1.85:1 for those who prefer that format."
1,Worst movie ever,Worst piece of crap movieDo not rentDo not buyDo not go near this movieIt is awfulI stopped watching it 10 minutes in
1,"skip the popcorn, bring a bottle of aspirin","After ten minutes into Ironman 2 I developed a splitting headache. Really. This movie is horrible....unless it was meant as parody. The scene editting(mind numbing split second shots)must have been done by some unemployed MTV gamer. Impossible to follow fast paced conversation, especially with Stark. As other reviewers complained, the advesarial quick-jab script really left these actors looking pathetic. And when is the public going to tire of computerized special effect crap? Sooooo overdone. Almost every character was some self-absorbed ego maniac. Narcissistic Hollywood enjoys creating high-society synthetic crappy art which reflects itself. Sooooooo boring. I truly hope this movie does not take up space on video store shelves in the sci-fi section. What a shameful expression of Marvel comics....and of sci-fi genre."
1,Not the Best,"I am not too crazy about Robert Downey Jr but thought the first movie was ok. This one just didn't measure up despite Scarlett J, Mickey R and Gwyneth P--all of whom I really like--being in it. It was just not entertaining to me. Sorry."
1,"First is great,second is terrible!!","I love the first iron man but must say sorry to this sequel,it's just terrible and boring!!Miscast(Mr.Rouke and Mr.Black lieutenant)and boring-to-death storyboard,I can't believe this is came from the same director!!Hope the third could be more fun."
5,Narcissism at its Funniest,"Iron Man 2 is very entertaining, whether its the hilarious badass comedy or the superhero antics, it does not disappoint. The movie is a great film to watch with a friend, spouse, or family. It entertains almost anyone and is well worth watching. Getting a blu-ray version is the way to go."
5,As good as the first!,"This is one of those rare times when the second movie is as good as (if not better) than the first. Definitely a must-own for anyone who likes ""superhero"" movies. (Bought it used/good condition and have no complaints!)"
4,THE book on how to approach venture capitalists.,"In all of my study of raising venture capital, this is the first book, in over 4 years of searching, that was able to answer all of my questions. My only fault with it is that it is over 10 years old. I wish David would update it to include information on the Internet economy.Other than that, a solid book! If you are serious about going after venture capital, BUY IT AND WORK THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Spell check your book please!,"After reading the first 50 pages of the ""updated and revised"" 2002 edition I have found numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes. In the book's opening paragraph the author apparently doesn't know the difference between than and then. Such carelessness is disturbing and distracting (especially in a book that is supposed to tell you how to write a business plan). It also makes you wonder about the authors' credibility."
4,"Originally found this in the library, but it's the kind of book one should OWN","I've always been interested in theatre and movies, but when I was a kid and even in my mid-thirties, even though I've published books, getting involved in movies seemed like suddenly wanting to become President of the United States. So I bought this book and refer back to it whenever aspects of producing an indie film seem daunting. This book's beautiful and great. GIRL DIRECTOR is another fun book (although originally for little girls). So you should buy this book if you can afford such a beautiful hard cover photograph book, and support the authors so publishers know we're out here and interested."
3,Dissapointing in the end,"The first half of this book is excellent in terms of tracking societal evolution and how it meshes with the technical evolution of modern timekeeping devices as well as explaining railroad time and zone time. So facinating that I couldn't put it down. The second half was so boring and dogmatic that if it weren't for the indignation it will certainly cause in any thinking adult, I wouldn't have been able to read 10 pages without going comatose. It covers the world of scientific speculation on the subject of the age of the Earth with virtually no objectivity or tolerance of any alternative opinion. Not only is the second half of the book poorly researched, supported and written (though, to give the author credit it can be difficult to write 170+ pages of unsupportable dogmatic drivel and make it interesting) it isn't even on the same subject you might expect the book to address. If you buy the book, I would recommend saving yourself the tears of frustration and skip part II."
1,Time's Pendulum kept swinging!,"It's about the quest to capture Time - from sundials to atomic clocks, this poetic & stimulating history retraces how we've measured this intangible & powerful force. Even though we can split a second into millions of moments we still can't describe what time is. When better than now, as a millennium begins, to read about our hunt for temporal time & how we've measured it. To spelunk the deep reaches of the universe to gauge the clock of the universe, to gauge the age of the orb we squabble over each day. A fascinating read, everything I think to write about this articulate & thoughtful book echoes with double entendres. ()"
5,the best socom so far,"ok, i agree with the other guy about the online credit card thing, but that is just going on what he said, i have never tried to play online, i am happy playing by myself. OK, i love it, it is by far one of the most well put togather games i have ever played. the draphics are amazing and so is the new AI. the vehicles also make it a lot of fun. i give it 2 thumbs up all around."
1,Requires credit card validation,"Be aware that Socom 3 REQUIRES credit card validation to play on-line, INCLUDING your verification code and answer to your ""secret"" question. This is a huge risk and an unnecessary security violation. Just wait until their servers are hacked or one of their employees decides to cash in on the database of complete credit card information (currently worth $100 each record). Can you say ""hello, identity theft""? Unacceptable. My purchase is going back."
2,Windows 95 book rebadged as 98,"This book is a Windows 95 prep which has been rebadged as 98. The authors didn't do as thorough a job as they should have. For example, QIC 40 is repeatedly mentioned as a supported backup device. This is true for 95 but not 98. Also, NETSETUP is the focus of some installation material in the practice tests even though it is not used in 98. New utilities like MS Batch 98 and DBSET.EXE are not mentioned. The book has much good material and I learned some interesting facts but I needed another guide to correct the factual errors where the authors hadn't updated the Windows 95 material to 98. Without the incorrect information, I would have given it four stars."
1,Contradictory to MCSE Training Guide,"This book covers the essential information for studying for Exam 70-098; However, while this book & MCSE Training Guide are both from New Riders there are many contradictions between the two. Recommend that you carefully use this book along with the MCSE Training Guide from New Riders"
1,Blasphemous,"The author's interpretation of the Bible's comments on masculinity are his very own, and because of that, attempts breach the contract between the believer and God. It's blastphemous (not to mention silly) and the promise keepers fuzzy goal is distinctly UnAmerican."
3,Only if you want to throw away your money,"The most popular latin singer worlwide of the late twenty century don't deserve this video. I have all the Julio Iglesias music CD and I have been waiting for this a long time. Deception. Low quality Video (is from a concert of 1980), low quality sound and only 11, yes, eleven songs from a singer that has hundreds on songs in his discography. I don't recommend it. Wait for another concert."
1,horrible sound,"i'm a great fan of Julio Iglesias, but this DVD should never have been released with an absolutely apalling sound quality as well as a poor selection of songs. I'm totally amazed any producer would put such poor sound quality on a DVD."
1,Awful in every respect,"Scandalously bad, totally amateurish. The sound is terrible - the orchestra can hardly be heard, 4 pretty girls (unidentified in the credits) are from time to time seen singing but can almost never be heard at all though each of them has her own mic. The camerawork is worse - Iglesias is almost always seen from only 1 angle, most of the orchestra is never seen at all, members of the audience are shown while the show is proceeding, the stage has nothing of interest. Finally, as another reviewer has noted, the entire concert lasts only 40 minutes, which is simply not believable (20,000 people did not brave the traffic of Jerusalem for a 40-minute concert), and the choice of songs we are vouchsafed is poorly organized, every song sounding pretty much like every other. I cannot imagine why Iglesias allowed this video to be released."
2,very small:no use,they are very small and possibly i am not going to use these.therefore i am going to return these.any way they are not such a good bargain
4,How cute is this message!,Wow - what a great message that it delivers to kids!! Don't give up on trying to learn to read and have respect for books - wonderful! I got it for free when ordering other books and if it wasn't so short I would've probably paid for it! :) It has cute rhymes that I think children learning to read will love - this could even be one of the first books they read because the language is very simple and easy to understand!!
1,Don't waste your money,This is like a 4 page pamphlet. Looks like something you would get in a happy meal. I wished I read the description better
1,Not regular books--Scholastics,"This is a booklet, Scholastic style. These are not large hard-cover books. It is about 6 pages. What a disappointment."
2,I know this is a good video...they just sent the wrong one,"My little boy has seen this video at the library and wanted a copy, but when I ordered they sent me a different version and we did not care for it. The company was nice and told us they didn't have the one we requested and refunded our money & we kept the other copy."
4,Dental Assistant Charm by Rembrandt Charms,I was very pleased with this charm. I bought it for my daughter as she graduated from Dental Assisting College. The charm is a little thinner than I expected and I would have liked it in 18k gold. But she loves it and it impressed all her fellow grads.Delivery was amazingly fast and efficient.
5,Pretty,I bought this because my son broke my current chain. I love the box chain necklaces because they are strong and pretty. I have never had a issue with the box chain necklaces breaking. So I found this and bought it for my charms of my children and it looks beautiful. I love it. Perfect length for me. I love long chains the short ones drive me crazy.
1,Gold chain,"I wore this for 5 days, and it turned BLACK I threw it away...I dont believe it was advertised correctly, but then again you get what you pay for, I will be getting my jewelry in person from now on."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Light in weight and light in color chain. You get what you pay for. It's a perfect ""I don't really know you but, here's a little something"" gift or for a child."
4,The Best Guide to Calming Upset Customers,"This is a very simple, short book, and that's good--unlike most business books, it doesn't fill its pages with unnecessary fluff to pad the page count. The exercises are fun and easy, and this book is highly recommended for anyone that has to deal with customers."
1,This product will burn your throat,"After a minute of taking this supplement, my throat had a burning sensation. It was very uncomfortable and feels as if you had a hot pepper stuck in your throat. I immediately threw the bottle away. Definitely NOT recommended."
3,Two and a Half Stars,"Being an avid Casteneda fan, I have to say I was disappointed with this book. I could barely bring myself to finish it. The author combines Christian and Buddist teachings with a white washed version of the Toltecs. For example, the book describes some of the ancient Toltec ruins as pure places of love. Perhaps Ruiz forgets that human sacrafice was practiced on some of those very same ruins?I put this book down and reread Casteneda's works and Regan's Evolution of a Warrior. Far better in my opinion."
2,Go to the Source,"To understand the teachings of Don Miguel Ruiz, I suggest you go to the source - read HIS books, attend HIS seminars, go on HIS pilgrimages. This book is a disappointment because of the author's filters, interpretations and theories. It muddies the waters and does not resonate with me as Ruiz's other books do."
1,Surprised,"The published works of Don Miguel Ruiz have an impact on just about everyone who reads them. Mary Carroll Nelson, in manipulating the ""truths"" revealed to her, manages to bias so many of Miguel's words that this book takes on a new light of its own. By representing her opinions thusly, Ms. Nelson casts a dark shadow potentially blocking readers from exploring the love of Don Miguel's teachings, unless, of course I misperceive his/her intent."
2,Was not happy with this book.,"I have read the other books from Don Miguel Ruiz. They were very good. This one was bad I feel. Compared to his, there was no comparison.What I am confused about is this statement from the book""Jesus' real father was a Zealot, a rebel warrior named Judas.'Anyone have any responses to this?Thanks."
5,Great book - one of my favorites,"I really enjoyed reading this. It does overlap some of the philosophies stated in his other books, but finds a way to go in different directions too. I liked the way the two styles of writing played out between the two authors. Overall I found it to be very inspiring and I could read it over and over again."
1,I want my money back. Does Don Miguel know about this farce?,"There is no truth in this book. It is written at the magical and mystical levels of development found in children under 10 years old. If you want to read about aliens, spirit possession, and gods of the pyramids, and Atlantis, then you should go ahead and read this. I suffered through the first third of the book before tossing it.If you want to know about enlightenment then read ""The Voice of Knowledge"" by the real guy - Don Miguel Ruiz. He does not write a foreword nor a single line in her book nor mention it on his website. I only bought it because he was listed as author. I think we are all entitled to a refund."
1,Repetitious hodge podge,"There certainly wasn't anything new offered by Ms Nelson that one couldn't get by reading the original offerings from don Miguel Ruiz. This book was a BIG disappointment. I would not, could not, recommend this book to anyone. Stick to reading the originals."
1,Very disappointing....,"I basically agree with most of the reviewers with negative comments. I couldn't finish the book. I've read and re-read Ruiz's books and they helped me a lot. I don't know why Ruiz let Nelson publish this book which obviously gave misunderstanding, confusion, or frustration to the Ruiz' fans and had a negative effect on his teaching. Also, I'm sad to see that so many people misunderstand that this book is written by him."
2,Stick To The 4 Agreements,"I've read The Mastery Of Love, The 4 Agreements and The Voice of Knowledge, and it is no exaggeration to say these books had significant influence over my life and through careful study of Don Miguel's ideas, my well being has improved substantially over three years.This book however, is a substantial diversion, and it delves much further into New Age ideas that lie on the fringe of academic thought at best. Mary Carroll Nelson lost me, and I couldn't get through more than half of this work before casting it aside permanently. I certainly would not recommend this to everyone, especially not people who stay grounded in academic circles. It may be valuable to the more whimsical minded."
1,A shoddy rehash !,"As The Smiths are my favorite band I bought this tribute cd thinking that it was a new release . I was cheesed off when I discovered that it was a cheaply rehashed version of a tribute cd that I already own . The original release was a double cd called "" Godfathers of Change Vol.1 "" released on the 24 hr record label , it contained 25 tracks and the packaging was excellent . The Cover Star version inexplicably omits 10 of the original tracks and the packaging is a joke ( they haven't bothered ) . If you really must have this cd , avoid being ripped off and hunt down the original ."
2,Interesting... but disappointing,"As a fan of the Smiths, I couldn't resist buying this tribute. Some of the songs are interesting, but I have to say that most are not worth listening. My wife who is even a bigger Smiths fan couldn't even sit through most of the songs! Well, we are just disappointed with this album."
1,This has to be a joke,"the first time i listened to this was in my dorm room late at night. After I listened to the ""how soon is now?"" attempt i burst out laughing waking my sleeping room mate. This is so incredibly awful, it gives me a headache to listen to. Still I do enjoy a laugh from time to time, so if you want funny listen to either the attempts of ""there is a light that never goes out"" or ""how soon is now?""Each time I listen to it tough i rush to get the real Smiths on my stereo to clense my ears of this aditory filth.Ps. i think the cover is silly too"
1,terrible,"this cd is just a bunch of really shoddy, tunless reworkings. i got rid of my copy after only 1 listen."
2,rubbish. listen to the samples.,"Come on ... how could anyone like this stuff ? Did all these cover bands really get the same 16 year old with the cracking voice to sing for them ? I couldn't even bear listening to the samples on the website. A note to any producers reading: if your band is already famous, then a sloppy recording of them singing live with several of their drunk friends might be considered an ""inside"" moment. If, however, your band enjoys complete anonymity, and doesn't have throngs of fans looking for more ""personal moments"" from the band, then it's just complete rubbish."
1,AAArrrghhh is your goal to sell this CD,cus' either the clips you chose are the craptastic ones or this release sucks!
1,..,"I hope the bands intended their covers to be funny, because they really are. Just judging from the Amazon sound clips though... I'm sure they , uh, sound great on cd."
2,BEWARE!,"The four star review from Santa Fe is for the commercial recording of Rheingold. None of his or her comments applies to this recording, whose sound is abominable."
4,Great Jane Campion behind-the-scenes doc!,"There's a really long (almost an hour) documentary on Jane Campion directing PORTRAIT OF A LADY. The filmmakers got really great access -- it's fascinating to see the soon-to-be ex-Mrs. Cruise at work (she does seem like a handful). But Nicole Kidman is nothing compared to Shelley Winters, who is clearly crazy. This is a great insiders look.There's also a beautiful short film from Belgium called GABRIEL which is about a little boy raised by nuns. It's stunningly shot and stays with you for quite some time. As does the other fictional film, which is about a shoemaker in India. That film (which is on the DVD cover) seems really, really long -- but that's clearly the filmmaker's intent. It's worth sticking it out -- because it's very poetic and really special.There's also some nice animation and a portrait of a rock and roll band.Quite a lot to digest!"
2,Breaks too easily!,"I purchased with timer about a year ago. After a few months, the clip behind the timer broke. I have never clipped this timer to anything, I have it stuck to my refrigetor. After only a few months of moving it around the refrigerator, it broke. The timer works perfectly but the clip/spring is cheaply made."
2,fades over time,I have two of these I purchased at different times. Both are fading... the numbers are so light I can hardly read them. I have changed the batteries but it doesn't help. They're cheap but you get what you pay for.
4,Thank you,Works fine. They just are not very loud. I use them to time tests and I give the tests in another room. But my students will bring them to me and let me know that their timer went off.
2,Unsatisfactory,"Cannot hear chime. Manufacturer doesn't respond to calls to correct the problem. Suggest this item not be ordered, due to non-response and inability to hear chime. Will not order Taylor products again."
3,So-so mechanism,"A little less than two years ago I bought one of these AND a slightly more expensive competitors model from Amazon to keep one in kitchen and one in the living room for comparison to see which was better. I started with cheaper well-rated models and both worked fine at first although the alarm volumes were both low. As time passed, they both functioned well but the other's sound volume began to degrade (I pitched it a long while ago and don't remember brand). After a while it started giving me button problems and I tossed it. The Taylor mechanical process still works well after that time but its volume too has dropped to almost inaudible even with it no more than 1-1/2' from my ear in a quiet space. I am in the process of replacing it but I think it was worth the price despite expecting it to last longer. It will still serve well to time short events where I can watch the timer count down (or up)."
1,You're better off looking at the clock.,"After 30-some uses, on/off button sticks, or double activates. VERY frustrating when I don't catch it. Magnet comes unglued after a couple of months, too. This was my second purchase--had hoped for better luck with the second one. It's Taylor-made landfill."
3,meh,"Buttons are waaay to small for someone with big hands... I ended up smashing it as a result... So men if you have bigger hands, steer clear."
3,Good timer but needs to be louder,"I like this basic timer for its simplicity of use. However, the beep so soft that it cannot be heard unless you are in the room with it and then if there are no other things like the TV going."
2,Not loud enough,This timer is not loud enough to hear if you are more than three feet away from it. BAD!!
2,Cheap quality. Breaks easily.,"We bought about six of these to time students taking tests. Yes, they measure how much time students have left. That's the good.The bad? Everything else. The buttons are hard to push. The build quality isn't that great. But the worst part for us is that the little stands on the back break off very easily, so they basically lie flat, with the numbers facing the ceiling, which means students can't see the numbers very easily.The problem is that plastic parts on the back break because they are too thin. This has happened to just about all of the timers we bought--one by one, they are becoming useless.And I don't think that these are all that cheap. They're seven bucks or so a pop; you can buy digital watches for less."
1,Display failed right out of the box,Display started to fail right after I opened it. Stay away from this product.
1,Bad Purchase,"Taylor is known for good products, but this timer falls short. You would have to be in a sound proof room to hear when it goes off. The beeper is too low for use in a busy kitchen, or any kitchen for that matter. Wish I had my money back on this one."
2,Timer is fine - clip/magnet broke off,"I received this as a stocking stuffer (yes, as a college student I still receive stocking stuffers :-)).The clock itself works fine. It can count up or down. I do not believe it stops beeping at any point once the alarm goes off (at least it continues to beep for 5 minutes). This might be a pro or con depending on what you are looking for. The neat little clip/magnet on the back was something I wanted in a timer, but on this Taylor timer, the clip broke within two months of occasional use. The plastic is cheap, so that is probably what is to blame. Overall, I'd suggest another timer because the clip/magnet was really what I liked in this cheap little timer."
2,Taylor digital timer,"Of the three I ordered, only one worked effortlessly. One of them I had to press and hold to get it to work, it finally worked. The last one never did work and I wasn't going to send back a five dollar item, it wasn't worth the trouble."
3,Great for the price,"Think the product is great for the low cost, but one cannot clear the timer if set incorrectly. For example, if set for 2 minutes and you only needed one minute, the timer cannot be reset until it counts down to zero."
3,Works all right,"For some reason it falls of my fridge and the battery guard comes off each time. It also beeps each time I push the seconds or minutes buttons so I have to listen to beeps while I'm entering the amount of time I'd like it to track for me. But, other than that it works just fine."
1,bad quality,"It's bad quality because the the protective tape on the display cannot be removed and the battery cover at the back cannot be pushed in its proper place. It is also not easy to use. Resetting the timer is too much trouble, you have to go over all the way until you reach 99 minutes and start from 0 to set new minutes."
1,Inaudible beep,"I do a lot of baking. I have at least 2 if not 3 timers going at any given time. This timer has the weakest beep of any timer I have used. In a quiet room with no other extra noise and the timer within 6 inches of my ear, the beep was barely audible. The was no hope of hearing it in a busy, noisy kitchen. Total waste of money."
2,waste of money,Not loud enough. Requires outstanding (dog-like) sense of hearing.Poorly designed. Pushing the buttons dislodges it from any vertical surface that it may be attached to by its magnet.Save your money.
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money. This piece of junk didn't work at all. I could hear it ticking but the display wouldn't turn on. I ended up just tossing it in the garbage since I didn't feel like jumping through all the hoops to return it.
1,Eh..it's does the job..but,"We got this to keep our older son in track to finish his homework. Unfortuantely, the quality is not that great and it's not that loud when the alarm rings. My daughter accidently dropped it from the table to the floor and the front plastic cover came off. Also the back metal stand stopped staying in place after awhile. There are others that are much better..you get what you pay for. This was cheap and so it was. Live and learn."
1,Dead on arrival,"The item description makes one interested and willing to buy it. The item arrived non functional. Maybe this is a bad item among thousands, but based on my experience I have to give it one star. As far as I am concerned, the product is useless."
3,Can't really hear it!,"My wife is an elementary school teacher and I bought this timer for her to keep time for different activities rotations, but her 14 kids can't hear it very well even when they are all reading to themselves!! The display is great and the fact that it counts up or down, but unfortunately it was not useful for her because of the volume."
4,Battery reminder,This timer does the job its simple not to loud thought. Just a reminder you have to take it apart to install the battery it will not work right out of the box.
1,Junk,"This timer lasted a couple weeks before the spring mechanism broke and the mangnet/clip fell off the back. A week later the battery compartment broke so that the door keeps popping off and the battery slips out of contact, resulting in a dead timer. Absolute Junk. You'll need to buy a new one in a month so you might as well pay a few extra bucks now for something that will last."
3,Consider these disposable.,"We use these as lunchroom timers in our school because they are simple, small and cheap. The stand and magnet clip break off quickly and the battery life is iffy since they are always on. We usually get about three months average use before the screen goes permanently blank."
2,Worked for a few months...,"You get what you paid for. This cheap, literally, timer is not worth the money. The back stand broke off within a month, and then the timer stopped counting down within a few more months after that. I've used this timer a total of probably 60 days. Horrible."
1,can't hear timer,The timer pitch is way to high I can only hear it when it is against my ear. My dog can hear it just fine.
1,Bought 4--all broken within months,"I got a good price on these, so I bought four of them for work. A few months later, they all stopped working. Very cheaply made. Don't waste your money."
4,Perfect for power naps,"I keep this by the couch for power nap purposes. It works great to set it to a 20-30 minute countdown-- much more convenient than setting a regular alarm clock. It's not terribly loud but, unlike my other alarms, has never failed to wake me up."
1,A piece of crap!!,"I didn't even get to use the timer once. I set the timer for some quiet reding for mt son and after I pressed ""start"" it reset itself and never worked again. It's very cheeply made."
2,keeps time,"This timer is pretty good, it works well.but the clip broke, not very sturdy.i would like it to be more sturdy."
1,Don't waste your money,It isn't durable or even water resistant. A little humidity makes it stop working. The stand rusted off and the spring broke. I now use it when I'm in a room far from the kitchen and need a portable noise maker to tell me when to go back and stir the food or turn it off.
1,Terrible Timer - Didn't work,"Bought two. Neither fully worked when they arrived. Battery caused it to turn on, but only sort of. The buttons were intermittently responsive, sometimes the timer wouldn't reset or stop. Other times it would. New battery made no difference. Beep was difficult to hear when it worked. Returned them immediately."
3,"Not good quality, get what you pay for I guess",This is the first timer I have ever purchased that has died on its own and only after a few months. (I have a habit of dropping them in the pasta water) This one hasn't been dropped and it just isn't working right. When you set the timer and think its on (it beeps) you walk away and come back and it never started to count down. Anyway I'm looking for a new one now and I wouldn't recommend this one. It worked okay in the beginning but long term I'd buy something else.
2,Not as Good as older model,"This product alarm is real lowToo Thin,FragileDon't Drop it!!!!If you can find older model get or spend a few more dollars"
2,Spend the extra money and get a better timer,"I needed a timer to help the kids with time management. The reviews made this timer seem very basic and it was small enough that they would be able to carry around in their backpacks. Once the time comes out of the box, you realize that it is made out of cheap plastic. After a week, the stand broke off and exposing the battery (the battery does stay in place). I should have spent the extra dollar and got a better timer. I did give the timer 2 stars, because it does work -- just not the best physical quality."
3,Gone!,I had this same Taylor Digital timer a year ago. It lasted 1-2 years. Not much of a buy if you ask me. Worked fine while I had it.
2,you get what you pay for,"I bought this timer mainly to time my espresso shots, and regret wasting my money. Within a few weeks, the plastic clip on the back broke off. A few weeks after that, the buttons became hard to use and I had to push very, very hard to get them to work. Because this was used in my kitchen, it was exposed to water from time to time, and after getting splashed with some water, it died. When it worked, it worked well. Unfortunately, it didn't work for long."
2,"works, but no on/off switch/button","The timer works and has a memory feature, but there is no way to turn it off when you are finished! You have take out the battery to keep from draining the battery down! Quite useless to keep up with the battery when not in use!"
2,It's a timer.,"The unit is small -- makes it a bit awkward to handle (I almost have to use two hands - one to hold it and the other to operate it). The upside to this is it is easily small enough to wear on a shirt pocket......which is also good, because it is not particularly loud. At the moment it's the only functioning kitchen time I have, and if I leave the kitchen I have to take it with me or probably won't hear it."
2,Can BARELY read the numbers!,"This timer serves it's purpose, however- barely, because you cannot read the numbers to know how much time you have left until your meal is cooked! It arrived with the top line of the digits just simply not there. Then, it became another line, then a few horizontals here and there. If it wasn't on my dime to return this item, I would have, but I must foot the shipping back to the seller and that frustrates me more than anything!!My occupation (ABA instructor for toddlers with Autism) requires the use of timers constantly, and at our center we use these exact ones and while I have run into the occasional issue with them, I must say, before I purchased THIS EXACT one for my home, I was quite pleased with these timers.Disappointed with it. But, you get what'cha pay for!! :) This was the least-expensive one on Amazon!! Hehe!!"
1,Cheaply made. Dead on Arrival.,The timer was very light and apparently cheaply made. It was dead on arrival out of the box.
2,Arrived Broken,"The LCD was broken when the product arrived. One of the numbers would not display. Aside from that, the product felt very cheap. I guess if it had arrived in working condition it would be worth the six bucks (hence the 2 stars), but I had to go buy something better."
1,did not do what I wanted it to do,"I purchased this timer to time an exercise program--the alarm is so faint that I cannot hear it even from 3 feet away - otherwise, it is fine--I just cannot use it and it was too expensive to return such an inexpensive item"
3,"Handy, but not durable","This item is easy to use, but does not last very long. Luckily, it is inexpensive, so I don't mind buying replacements"
1,too quiet,It was so quiet you'd have to put it right next to your ear to hear. Definitely not loud enough for a kitchen timer!
1,Broke immediately.,"Arrived on time. Was cheap. Broke immediately. I guess that's to be expected, but still, guys, bad form."
2,OK. Wish it could turn off.,Received this item from Amazon this week. I like the look and feel of the little timer but I can't figure out how to turn it off. I don't think it turns off...it just sits in my drawer while the battery drains. They should add a little on/off switch...even my son's freebie Happy Meal games have an off switch.
5,Works great,I like how it has a magnet on the back so it can stay on the refrigerator. Works fine. Does the job.
1,Timer,I read the review and I ordered these timers for my son to use for games or in the kitchen. I just received them and neither one work. What is with that! What a big pain. I bought a timer at the store and never had a problem. I buy these and they come not working.
2,Taylor Digital Minute/Second Timer,"The timers were ok, however we preferred the other timers we ordered. The numbers were bigger and the alarm tone was better."
3,Taylor timer,"I was looking for something that would remind me at 2 hours after a meal to stick my finger for blood sugar measurement. The timer is O.K., but the alarm is too low to remind me unless I am right by it."
4,Great for the price,"Excellent product, but don't go past the time you want to set or you will have to keep going past 99 to get back to it."
5,Takes a licking,and keeps on ticking. I've dropped this more times than I can say and gotten it wet. It just keeps working.
2,Go clipless,"It works as a timer and, after timing out, it resets itself. That means that I can time 20 minutes and then it resets to 20 minutes so I can repeat.Anyway, I don't like it. The magnet is mounted to the back of the clip resulting in poor balance. When it is stuck to the fridge and I poke buttons the thing often spins upside down or falls to the floor.I'm replacing it with one having no clip."
3,Adequate,This timer may or may not work when you want to set it. You have to play with it. It's more of a toy than a useful product. The ringer is very soft which may be good or bad depending on your situation.
2,Good but quiet,"It is nice to use for things other than cooking because it allows you to time in seconds (I use it for family games where we race against the clock.), but it is very quiet and hard to hear if you are not in the same room, so it doesn't help much if you have to leave the kitchen to work on other things."
2,"Worked great....for a short while, then failed to function",Display failure after only a month or so of use.Went in the trash.Sorry.... look elsewhere.
2,You get what you pay for,"This timer gets the job done, and the price can't be beat. Mine still works just fine, and yet I'm online looking for something better because the beeps are very shrill, and to clear it back 00:00 you have to press M and S at the same time, which is awkward, and doesn't always work. I want something with a ""clear"" button and a more tolerable and louder beep. Construction is cheap--it fell on the floor and came apart into multiple pieces. I managed to reassemble it, but the screen is now cracked. I liked my West Bend digital timer MUCH better."
3,basic timer is OK,"The thing works fine, can be stuck to the fridge via a magnet on the back, also has a clip on the back. It is easy to use and has a readable display. Cons- cannot turn display off!? And beep isn't very loud... Will turn out okay if batteries last long with display always on..."
2,Not a good timer,"First of all, it is not water resistant, like it advertised, and why I bought it in the first place. This is a false advertisement! A little bid of water splash onto it will get into the display. It is very flimsy and I paid almost twice the amount of what it is now a couple of months ago. It is just not a very good timer. But at about $4.00 it is then OK to consider (only with free shipping)."
1,Do not buy it,I am not at all satisfied with the product.The battery door broke the very first day I bought it.There is no way to reset the timer.The sound is also very low.its not at all worth the price.
1,"fell apart immediately, quit working entirely after 6 weeks","I bought this to use as a timer in a 12-step meeting where we like people to limit their sharing to 5 minutes. Several different people operated this timer, which was not up to the challenge. The battery ""door"" broke the first night we used it. Tonight after about six weeks the timer wouldn't operate at all. We tried a new battery. No luck. This timer is just too cheap."
3,A very small timer.,This is a very basic timer with which is very small and compact. It works as a timer for our kids doing chores so I don't have any complaints.
4,Works Great,"The timer works great, however when it goes off, it's quiet.Also you'd have to push the buttons for every minute/second you need rather than holding the button down to get to...say 60 minutes...All-in-all, it works well!"
2,Meh...,"Starts off great..simple, counts up, down, etc., but after a few months, the buttons get fussy and don't register presses properly. But for $5, I don't expect much better."
1,Too cheap,"Bought one at Targe and upon opening it and trying it out realized I'd wasted my money. Loose attacment of magnet means you can't use it while on the fridge .Beep is very weak, too soft to be heard if anything else is going on. In a word, useless. When will someone make one with a BIG magnet that will never fall off in use??"
3,Simple timer that works well.,"This timer has a magnet and a clip/stand, and works well up to 99min and 59sec. I just wish there was a way to shut it off other than taking the battery out. Even though the timer does not shut off it has still been working great after at least a month."
2,Taylor/ digital minute/second Timer Review,"A few of the timers we recieved did not work, and the packaging for shipping was terrible, no wonder they did not work!"
5,el tartamundo,"fans if you liked the first one ,youll love this one even hotter,this group is very talented/young group who are very professional @ what they do...the song mentioned also has a video...so please keep a eye out on that ,this album is awesom ...live is even better,i want to praise this young and talented group of guys for the hard work and dedication they have given thier fans ,and for providing fans such as my self w/this music i rate this album 10 stars if allowed"
1,Worked great...then died! :(,"For 5 months, this was one of the best coffee makers I ever owned. It has a large opening to the reservoir so no annoying spilling as you're trying to fill it, it's programmable with a nicely visible clock that kept perfect time, and it brewed very quickly. Then the honeymoon ended. :(After 5 1/2 months of light use (one pot, every other day or so), it just suddenly stopped heating today. The clock still works fine, so it's getting power, just won't heat at all. I will try contacting Black & Decker (with crossed fingers) for a replacement and hope this was a fluke, but after being so pleased with this coffee maker, it just makes it's premature demise so much more disappointing!Will update review if B&D; replaces."
1,Clock problems...,"Right from the beginning we had a problem. The first night we set the clock to the correct time and then programmed the machine to start brewing at 5:30am the next morning. When I checked the machine at 5:30 am the brewing had not started because the clock now read 1:30am......ok, so maybe it got bumped. One design problem is it's REALLY easy to bump the clock buttons.....BUT it would have had to have been bumped 20 times! So I reset the clock and pushed the on button to start brewing right away.....no big deal. That afternoon at about 3:30pm I decided to go program the machine to brew a pot about 4pm or so, but once again I find the clock is EXACTLY 4 hours behind.....AGAIN.Long story short, don't trust the clock which also means it is useless to program the machine and expect a steaming pot of coffee when you wake up."
2,No adequate replacement carafe,"I was satisfied with the coffee maker. Especially like the permanent filter, hadn't had one of those before. But I gave this model only two stars because the replacement carafe just won't do. The only replacement option from Black & Decker does not really fit this coffee maker model DE755B. You have to shove i in to fit and then it is really stuck so you have to practically topple the coffee maker to retrieve the carafe. Just any carafe won't do, it has to press up against the area where the coffee comes out or the coffee won't come out!"
2,Brews very weak coffee!,"Like the title says, this brews very weak coffee! I am not a coffee snob either."
2,Heating not working,I had this B&D DE755B (12 cup programmable coffeemaker) for two years that I was using without any problems but last week it suddenly stopped working. It's not heating the water or the heating plate although there is power (and the clock is working perfectly). The customer service told me that the internal heating element is not replacable so I have to throw away the unit which is very upsetting. I had trust in B&D products but now I have to think twice while considering it for my next purchase.
1,clock problems for me too,"We also had clock problems right out of the box, just like the other reviewer. The timer is big feature for us, but it never worked. What's also weird is once the clock goes haywire, you have to unplug it or plug it back in to set it correctly. Otherwise when you get past 12 for the hour, it starts counting 13, 14... then starts skipping all around.Also the pot leaks all over the place when you're trying to pour water in the reservoir.We'll be taking this one back to the store and getting something else. Bad quality!!!"
1,"Terrible, lukewarm coffee","Got this from Walmart because it seemed like a good deal for the price ($24.99 at the store). Terrible terrible choice. I could not even call this a 'brewer'. As soon as you hit 'on', it starts dripping immediately. The coffee is only warm. I've tried both the filter it comes with and disposable paper filters to no avail, with different levels of fineness of the ground coffee. I don't know if this is a defect or if Black & Decker people like their coffee lukewarm, but I'm returning this P.O.S. immediately."
2,After 3 months it stopped heating and brewing.,Worked great for 3 months then just stopped brewing and heating. All sorts of bad reviews all of the www. Might be a bad heating element. Get a replacement here:[...]
4,Blast from the Past,"This is the same Stanley Demos who owned the Coach House restaurant, in the late 70s the finest restaurant in Lexington, KY. He also had a weekly recipe column in the Cincinnati Enquirer called ""Stanley Suggests"".The recipes are formal Southern/Continental, and typical of the era: Oysters Rockefeller, Shrimp Newburg, Swiss Steak Burgundy, and, of course, Baked Alaska!"
5,Great Little Cookbook,"My husband and I rediscovered this cookbook that has been sitting unused for years. A wonderful selection of recipes, both simple and complex. We have been using the book almost non-stop. My husband made a complex chicken dish, I made the simple turkey tettrazini. Both were delicious. Lots of sauces, butter, mushrooms,wine, and goodness. The restaurant was in Kentucky, I was never there. The book was a wedding present from one of his fans. He is Greek and seems to be influenced by Italian, French, American, and all good foods. Recipes are easy to follow."
3,Excellent book for the price but....,"It's an excellent book on the history of papyrus but I would like to see the author expand more on the actual making of the product in detail, both in ancient times and today. Excellent book for the price and very well written. There are a few websites showing how to make the product that are well illustrated but please...where can I purchase a book that I can lay down beside me as I work? Will someone publish one?"
2,Not so great,"Ive had the pan a month or 2 its never been in the oven or the washer, nonstick works well, holds lots, but its warped, and I rarely use max heat on my ceramic top, but this pan is headed for the trash can. Would be great on gas or coil type range."
1,Cheap farberware,This pan is not up to the quality of farberware. Good farberware pans have better construction and better non stick than this one.
1,Cheap Farberware,This pan is not up to the usual farberware quality. It seems they licensed their name to some low end manufactor out of thailand.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this pan - within weeks, despite carefully following all instructions, the bottom of the pan warped so that it is no longer usable on my flat surface stove. I had hoped, with the good Farberware name, that this would be avoided. Other than that, it seems a quality pan."
1,Bubbles,I bought one of your pans and I was so very careful with it only using plastic or wood utensils. The pan has got big bubbles in it and the nonstick finish is pealing off. I rate this very poor.
5,Great Skillet,"This is not the cheapest skillet out there, but has proven to be well worth the money. It sits flat on the stove burner (no wobble like cheaper models) and is heavy and durable. The extra handle comes in handy when needing to empty heavier contents like pasta or chinese style vegies. Because the skillet is thick, it takes a little while to heat up, but once it reaches the desired temperature it holds it very well. I've used it for all types of recipes so far and it consistently cooks evenly and cleans very easily. If you are looking for a well made, durable skillet, you won't go wrong with this one."
3,Good pan but stupid handle,"I needed a bigger skillet, and this one works, but the handle is short and uncomfortable when trying to carry it (especially with food in it). Other than that, it works great, but I really can't recommend it."
1,Low Quality Farberware Skillet,"The nonstick surface on this 12"" nonstick aluminum Farberware skillet started peeling after 6 months of mild use and proper care. This peeling renders the skillet unusable.Will try to return but the internet feedback indicates little consumer success with this Farberware issue."
4,Glad to have it!!,"I had a similar Farberware skillet, and it was one of my most used. I could fix a meal for four using just this skillet. Sadly it became old and worn. The non-stick was useless. I was happy to find this on Amazon. I have to agree with the other reviewers neither the old skillet or this has a lid. It would be a perfect 5 star if it did."
2,Great while it lasts... which seems to be less & less.,"Great size, love the handle, must hand wash unfortunately, & last but not least: It will last about 6 months even with great care. My first one lasted 2006-2010, 2nd one 2010 to 2011, 3rd one purchased 2011 in the spring and by Fall is was useless. Losing finish & has not been non-stick for a few months now. I give up!"
2,Disappointed,I found this skillet to be less than non-stick. My scrambled Better Than Eggs stuck to the skillet.. As I said.. Very disappointed.
2,Not true to size,"I ordered this pan to fit a 10 inch lid I own. This pan measures 9 3/4 inches external diameter and 9 1/2 internal at the rim. As it doesn't fit my lid, I will be sending it back. Quality-wise, it looks good. My Revere Polished Aluminum 10-Inch Nonstick Skillet is an actual 10 inches."
2,"""Stainless Steel""","Whats wrong with this person. I bought this pan entirely based upon the fact that it was advertised to be a Steel product. My plan was to use it for induction cooking. This product is made entirely of Aluminum. Now, I have to go through the work of mailing it back. I have other pots and pans coming. I hope its not the same story. The cookware must be made of steel in order to be used with induction heating."
3,too heavy and expensive,Too heavy and expensive for a 12-inch skillet. Week after i bought this nonstick skillet online i saw a similar skillet for just $11.99 at Walgreens.
1,Creepy Guy,"This is a book about a man who lived for years in a primitive culture, married an uneducated, ignorant young girl woman when she was 9 years old - he was 34 - but what? was respect enough to hold off consummating the marriage until she was 14.He then took her away from everything she knew to live in NJ.Into power imbalance, much?So he was a child predator in a land of innocents and the fact that other (male) anthropologists here have no problem with that (Western sexual mores are so uptight!) is telling.I am trying to imagine the reaction if a female anthropologist did the same thing with a 9 year old male child, but then the field is rife with sexism.Best that child predators just be honest and visit Thailand, although they would not be able to hide behind any respectability by writing a book, of course."
5,excellent read!,"this is an exceptional book. I could not put it down. It is a book that will capture your soul and heart from beginning to end. I also had the pleasure to be taught by the author, Dr. Good. He is a marvelous, enlightening, and kind man. His story is a real eye opener to other cultures that are very different from the U.S. incredible book that I will continue to read over and over again. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did!"
4,American's Battalion,This book was great reading material. I liked the way the book was written. Good job....
2,Needs much improvement,"I got this coffee machine to replace the KitchenAid machine that was recalled. I already miss my old machine that I was not very happy about.This machine has no gauge or similar to measure how much water you are pouring. So, I have to use a separate measuring cup to fill the water tank.It has no flow speed adjuster for the coffee strength.Neither does it have a setting for 1-3 cups or similar.Despite the fact steam rises out of the carafe when pouring the coffee, it is not hot.And it has a flat coffee basket into which our Aroma Brown filters do not fit.After much adjusting, coffee tastes OK now... so 2 stars instead of 1."
2,Not quite there,"I know Saeco from their espresso machines, which are great. But I couldn't get along with the design philosophy in this coffee maker. I was glad that there are no frivolous bells or whistles, but this train just wouldn't run on time for me.A big irk was not having a fill line indicator in the reservoir. I use the detachable faucet at my sink to put water in, and I would've had to scrawl my own line. Why?Then, this sounds petty, but the carafe poured much too slowly. It irked me that the spout was small enough that coffee seemed only to dribble out.Finally, I have our coffee maker positioned next to the sink, below some cabinets. Because opening the lid, for water & coffee, takes up a lot of real estate, I had to pull the unit forward till it was nearly off the counter.Nope. This unit is not quite there."
1,Worst coffee maker I have ever owned,"But then my last one was a Capresso! Illy was selling these, so I thought they knew what they were talking about and ended up buying it on Amazon. EVERY time I have made it, it required a lot of coffee to get adequate flavor, temperature was never hot, and filters are a hassle, and each time you pour coffee the carafe drips. Such a hassle. It has overflowed multiple times all over my counter as well. The last time I did, I unplugged it and threw the thing in the trash. Lesson learned."
4,A fun read and a good introduction to both Gaiman and Pratchett,"If you're either a Gaiman or Pratchett fan and you haven't read this, do yourself a favor and get on it right away.If you know nothing about either author, this is a good entry point to both of their works.Oddly, in some ways, Gaiman + Pratchett < Gaiman or Pratchett alone, but it still works very well. There isn't as much humor as in your typical Pratchett book or as much poignancy as in your typical Gaiman book (which is not to say that Pratchett can't be poignant or Gaiman can't be humorous...merely that the combination seems to have muted these characteristics somewhat)."
4,Laugh Out Loud Funny,Neil Gaiman is one of my favourite writers..I have read and now own his complete Sandman Comics run.I have not read anything by Terry PratchetThis book was a fast paced read with a lot of references to obscure religious and pop stuff.This is a British book so if you don't like or get British humour this may not be for you.Also if you are offended by people taking a light-hearted approach to religon this book should be avoided.Overall I thought this book was very good and had characters I liked.I would have liked to see The Four Horseman to be more fleshed out and the scenes with The Them to be a little funnier.If after you read this you want more Neil Gaiman check out Ansai Boys.
3,I was a bit dissapointed,I love both of these authors.It's a very good book but I think I must have just expected too much.Their work in separate is just so much better.
5,A real life laugh-out-loud book,"I have read many, many books, and some are funny the first couple of times through. But this book is still funny even after five years of re-re-reading it. I am still getting funny looks in public when I read it and snort-laugh in public. I have recommended it (never loaned out my copy, what if they kept it?) to several people and they all have bought it.The humor is not the only important part of the book though. There are some serious moments, and some explanations of things I have long wondered about (Elvis, Queen, and Mother Shipton to name a few).All in all, I think everyone, except fundamentalists, should read this book."
4,Good Omens...we do need it!,"An hilarious satire of apocalyptyc doomsayers of all time. Pratchett and Gaiman tell us that humanity,what whit human potential for greed,hatred,bigotry,violence,stupidity,terrorism,egoism,indifference,shortsightedness,pollution,is still too crazy to really destroy herself. Even the horsemen of the apocalypse are confused. I liked it!"
4,i actually thought a book was funny!,"I like reading books but I never read them to make me laugh. I have TV or my friends to do that, however, this book made me laugh OUT LOUD! There were many subtle jokes that when I caught them, made me proud. ANyways, the book is full of plots and subplots that all seem to come together in the end...and then end is great, i loved it...it's worth waitin for"
5,Does for religion what Douglas Adams did for sci-fi,"In the manner of laid-back british sarcasm, which so often makes for pleasant reading, it's easy for an author to overdo it and force the language into Douglas-Adamsesque epithets. (eg Starship Titanic) Luckily, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchet have not let anyone down here. Good Omens for me, does for religion what Douglas Adams did for sci-fi with ""The Hitchhiker's Guide..."". Not only is it clever, zany and just witty enough, but the author's paint a pleasant story with wonderful characters as well. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED if you're a fan of Douglas Adams. (or any other British humour for that matter -- Red Dwarf works just as well)"
5,A darkly whimsical journey through last days of the world.,"I love the combination of these two wonderful authors. The comedical characters bring everything to life. i'm in the middle of reading this book again and it's not tireing to read again. It's an amazing adventure through the lives of an Antichrist, an Angel, a Demon, a satanic nun, and a witchfinder and witch. It's such a humorous look at the end of the world. No one should be afraid if this is the way it's going to go! Everyone should read it. I was laughing out loud. It was wonderful"
3,middle of the road,"Not great, but not awful. I found too much of the humor in the book was self-conscious or forced. I am a big fan of the Sandman series, but found nothing of that exceptional talent at work here. Good for a plane trip."
4,The world has never looked the same to me,"Other reviews have described this book well. I'll add only that the Horsepersons' exploits are all too vivid and believable, as are the means by which they (almost) extinguish life on earth. Now I can't hear a news story without thinking about how they could have orchestrated it, though I alone seem to have this obsession. I know they're as fictitious as the other characters, but the world would make a lot more sense if they weren't.The humor is also more esoteric than in the Discworld books; many biblical or 1980s-England references were probably lost on me. But it's full of the nonstop randomness and astute commentary at which Pratchett excels, with Gaiman adding a grimmer edge."
5,my #1,"this is my absolute favorite book ever! i have not been able to really get into either author separately, but together they are unbeatable! i have heard comparisons to christopher moore- and i don't disagree, BUT- this book resonates in a way that no other has. if you like to laugh, this is a must read! why won't they make an audio version so i can listen in my car?"
5,A Book That Keeps On Giving,"This is the type of book that keeps giving; scenes revisited in random conversations, quotes shared with friends, the book itself passed on with the condition that it MUST be returned. I love how death SPEAKS LIKE THIS, how the Anti-Christ has a resourceful, plucky group of friends armed with bikes and snacks, and how an angel and demon who should be at odds, simply like each other.There are times when I laughed out loud, folding over the page corner so I could read it again later to my husband. I can see the influence of both writers. One particular gruesome scene involving telemarketers just had to be written by Gaiman. All those elaborate footnotes were probably Pratchett. My edition of this book had an addendum where the two authors discussed their first meeting and how it worked to write the book together. Their musings are as entertaining as the story they wrote."
5,The most hilarious book on the subject matter...,Wow! This book was simply wonderful! The story is amazingly complete and completely amazing. It is humourous science fiction at its best. I really loved this book. Anyone who doesn't like this book should go right out and buy a sense of humour
1,Guess you have to be from England,I really wanted to like this book. I just didn't understand the humor and some of the words just went right over my head. A lot of phrases that are foreign to me so it made reading it almost impossible.
1,Why didn't they put HAHA on the margins?,"I always remember jolly good British comedies. Some of them were great and some of them needed that laughing in the background to maybe even make u laugh at stupid pranks.This book was written in pseudo-humorous style and I just couldn't read it ... humor was either too tasteles or too extremely phytonish. They REALLY ought to print HA HA on the margin.If Gaiman earned decently from Newerwhere, American Gods and this one, why would he make Sandman Dream Hunters and Sandman Endless nights?"
2,Just couldn't get into it,"I picked up this book on the suggestion of a friend. Said it was a fun read and something that I would enjoy. He was wrong. I did manage to finally plow through the book but did not enjoy it at all. Most of it was predictable, a lot of it was not funny (while it tried to be funny). If you are going to spend your money on a book, there are hundreds of thousands of better reads than this."
3,Not Bad.,"This book isn't bad. It really should be classifed as comedy. Yet, this is the last Neil Gaiman book that I will ever read.Yes, it is the end of the world. There are demons and angels, but if you don't like sarcasm you won't like this.Personally, I love sarcasm. It is what I live for, but this just didn't do it for me. I would steer you toward something like Janet Evanovich (Humorous Chick Lit) or my fave Chuck Paluniak.Anyhow good luck hunting but skip this one."
3,"Witty, humorous, but BORING.","Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors... i LOVED ""Neverwhere,"" ""Stardust,"" & ""American Gods."" But i just recently decided to read ""Good Omens,"" one of Gaiman's older works.It is a witty, humorous version of the apocalypse. I appreciate Gaiman & Pratchett's knowledge and creative attempt at the subject...However the book is very long-winded and hard to get through...And watch out Americans, you may not get some of the British humor... i think i missed some of it."
5,Good Omens,This book is a great piece of literary work. I couldn't put it down. It will lift your spirits to a new level.
2,Not my Favorite Gaiman,"I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman, but this may be my least favorite work of his. This is because GOOD OMENS is written as a pure farce, where all the characters act in a silly and unbelievable manner. This novel features a very large cast of characters, and almost none of them are fully developed. As a result, I didn't find this novel particularly engaging.GOOD OMENS is very funny in spots, but I think the authors are more interested in being clever than telling a good story. That's okay for a piece of short fiction, but the cleverness wears thin in a 400-page novel. I enjoyed the beginning of this book, but got tired of it after the first hundred pages. Many compare this book to HITCHHIKER's GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, but keep in mind that this novel is over twice as long as HITCHHIKER.If you've never read Gaiman before, my advice is to read NEVERWHERE or STARDUST first. Those novels will give you a better sense of his enormous talent."
5,The Apocalypse Can Be Funny...,"Good Omens is a great read; the story line follows an angel and a demon as they partner their way to prevent the end of the world (and the resultant end to their interactions amongst humanity). Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett team up to craft a story full of the humor, satire and well developed characters you'd except from any of their solo works.As an added bonus, DEATH makes an appearance, as one of the four horsemen, though Pollution has replaced Pestilence, who found the going tough due to antibiotics."
5,Absolutely excellent entertainment.,"This is one of my favourite Terry Pratchett books. I wanted my own copy to reread. Funny, clever, fast-paced - a delight to read from beginning to end. I read the novel feverishly the first but the second time you get to savour the humour and reveal layers you missed the first time.Good Omens. The Nice and Accurate Propecies of Agnes Nutter, With"
2,I think Gaiman just isn't for me,"I really want to like Neil Gaiman, and this is the second Neil Gaiman book I've read, but it's just not happening. His plot lines are somewhat interesting, but his characters are flat and undeveloped. I might be willing to give Stardust a chance because I really loved the movie, but that's seriously his last chance with me."
3,Could have been better,"There's a quote on the cover that calls it ""A direct descendant of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". And while I think the type of wacky humor is very similar, it really pales in comparison. The authors never really sold me on the characters. Crowley is no Zaphod and Anathema no Trillian. All of them just feel underdeveloped through the first couple of hundred pages.It was by no means a page turner, just something I picked back up every couple of days and read a few dozen pages in."
2,A Voice of Dissent,"The vast majority of people who read this book seem to absolutely love it. In fact, it was after several ranting reviews that I finally picked it up. If you're a diehard Pratchett or Gaiman fan, you'll very likely love it.However, for the rest of us, this is really not all it's cracked up to be. The characters are thin and one dimensional. A good lot of the jokes fall flat on their faces. The world's logic is extremely inconsistant within it's own scope. We all know that it's supposed to be absurd and rediculous from time to time -- and sometimes it does so well. Too many others, and it does so a bit too poorly.The most entertaining bits seem to involve the vast and frequent footnotes.All in all, if you're looking for a a classic Brit Humor tale about an eleven year old Antichrist, this book is for you. If this sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, ignore your friends and co-workers and move on."
2,Ugh,"I've never read anything by Mr. Pratchett, but this is, In my opinion, Neil Gaiman's weakest work. It's as if the authors had gotten together to write a spoof of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with angels and demons rather than aliens, and then could not come up with anything but silly banter and nonsense to fill the pages. The characters are quaint to to the extremes of being annoying and tiresome. The plot can be summed up in ten words or less. It's supposed to be satire, but it's really poor caricature."
2,Terry Pratchett,It is a book written in the Terry style but not a discworld novel.Found it one of his lesser books mayby because of the other auther.
1,Thank God I Never Have to Spend Time With These Men,"What a self conscious mess. This was a storyteller telling a story about a story--yeah, now demand your money back. It's amazing to me how many writers don't hold themselves up to the standards of great storytellers but then prance around the media as if they are the world's best writers. I thought writers were supposed to be the seekers of truth. Turn it onto yourselves. This book should have never been published."
5,Pratchett and Gaiman - Success!,"This book is a losely based on the film Omen. You do not have to have seen the film to thoroughly enjoy this book. It describes a very British Armageddon.At the centre of the story are one good and one fallen angel. The fallen angel was never really convinced about Lucifer in the first case, and the good angel has a skeleton in his closet. The good angel is actually the funniest character in the whole book. For instance, he collects bible with misprints in them - I still chuckle five years after I read the book!Prattchet supplies the humour and Gaiman the atmosphere, so even the most funny sections have a threatening undercurrent, and the scary parts are subtly funny. I hope they do more collaborations."
5,The Apocalypse.....,"has never been more exciting. I thouroughly enjoyed this book. I would compare Gaiman & Pratchetts' writing style in this book to that of Douglas Adams (Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy). I especially liked the 4 ""bikers"" of the Apocalypse. If you have an open mind and can laugh easily this is the book for you!!!"
5,Absolutely Hilarious and Enjoyable,"This is one of the best books I must say I've ever read - it's funny, witty, and highly enjoyable. The characters are well-formed and developed and the writing catches you from the very first pages. Highly HIGHLY recommended."
5,My Favorite Book,"I'm not going into any great detail, but this book has been atop my favorite book list for nearly a decade now. It has fought off staunch competition, but it remains the one book that I read annually and have yet to grow tired of. Funny, satirical, original, fun. Pratchett in general is always a good read."
4,Hellishly funny,"Finally, the insight Milton never gave us into the true workings of Heaven and Hell! A rollicking journey through the final days before the apocalypse, funny and dark."
5,James DeWitt said it best,"SYNOPSIS:The Antichrist is coming. The world's about to end. The only problem is the ""rank and file"" angels and demons (who've begun to enjoy each other's company and understand each other over the eons) aren't so sure they want Armageddon to come.MY TAKE:I'll keep this short. I adore Douglas Adams and the twisted wry humour found in both his ""Hitchhiker's Trilogy"" and the books of the Dirk Gently series. The blurb said it was similar. I gave it a try. It was.You will especially enjoy this if you have:1) a DECENT working knowledge of Christianity (to get some of the subtle digs)2) a knowledge of pop culture depictions of evil (the Exorcist movies and the like)3) the ability to laugh at your own religious perspectivesI consider myself an evangelical and thought this was laugh out loud outrageous. But if you're of the mindset that God can't take a joke, well, you're probably better off with a different book..."
5,One of the most entertaining books I've ever read,"This is a wonderful example of the whole being better than the sum of its parts: while both authors are perfectly wonderful on their own (Gaiman is especially fantastic), together they were able to create something utterly unique ... and, honestly, now that I've read the novel at least a half-dozen times, I'm a little offended at the blurb on the cover that compares it to ""The Hitchhikers Guide."" I haven't yet read anything that came close to this book for pure, giddy, dark joy and moments of uncontrollable laughter. My partner has read the book almost as many times as I, and we still find the need to read some of the more brilliantly hilarious passages out loud to each other. And I now never leave my tapes in the car for any longer than a week. ;)"
5,Hon wa kakkoi desu!,"This books is without a doubt one of the best I have ever read. My beat up, been to hell and back copy resides beside my bed, in the place of honor. I loved it, in short.While at times the book moves slow, even those few chapters are thoroughly entertaining, and chock full of the mad humor that so often defines the British. The prose, such as it was, was smooth and rarely, if ever, impeded on the story telling aspect.The characters and settings were well developed, even the minor ones. None of the characters were so stupid as to be offensive. None of them were exceedingly bright, persay, but none were stupid. The dialogue between them was smooth and moved the story well."
5,Great read,"This was a really great read. I was worried it would feel like two different people competing for a voice in one book, but it flows so well you forget it's a collaboration and just enjoy the amazing story."
3,Should be just Crowley and Aziraphale,"These two are the absolute stars of the book. There were a handful of other good supporting roles, like the Satan nuns and the Four bikers. But Adam and Them were downright boring. I even got tired of Anathema and Newton Pulsifer. And the ending was downright cheesy - Adam's speech seemed like it was written for the children's Saturday morning specials. This book should have really focused solely on Crowley and Aziraphale because they were the most entertaining, funniest, and likeable characters."
5,Fun,"The end of the world as if told by Douglas Adams. Well less crazy than most TP novels, and less pretentious than many NG novels. Makes a great gateway drug to the writings of both. I buy copies of this book as gifts constantly."
4,"An amazing story, an amazing read","From the two masters of the fantasy genre comes a hilarious tale of the apocalypse, as caused by a little boy. The story follows a demon called Crowley and an angel named Aziraphale as they seek Adam, the son of the antichrist that who was accidentally switched with another boy at birth. Now, Adam is being raised by in an average middle-class home, and is one of the sweetest boys you'll ever meet, according to his parents anyway.From the Satanic order of chattering nuns, to the death-by-holy water, this book will have you rolling on the floor and turning its pages for a long time to come. A great read."
3,Humorous,"Did someone at the NYT's really write: ""A direct descendant of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""? I suppose that's a misdirection that a marketing type would invent but the book is closer to something Mark Twain would write than Adams."
5,Good Omens = Good Times,Neil Gaiman plus Terry Pratchett equals one hell of a rollicking good time. Equal parts funny and entertaining this is a study of how Armageddon might look if seen through a lens with a decidedly Douglas Adams' tint. Highly recommended.
1,"frustrating, wild romp to nowhere","I love Neil Gaiman. I love Terry Pratchett. I hate Good Omens. In a frustrated attempt to read the book cover to cover, I was twarted many times by books that were much funnier, more pleasant to read, and more comprehendable(anyone by Goodkind or all other Gaiman/Pratchett books, jordon, adams). This book did not make sense, was a half hearted attempt at low brow humor (which unfortunately did NOT work) and why read this if you can spend your time elsewhere? It's a good omen you read this review before thinking about buying the book..don't waste your time or money like I did."
1,Awful doesn't begin to describe this book,"I rarely write reviews on book, but this one was too awful not to write a review and warn other readers. I was looking forward to a funny book but found myself having to plow through the pages in hope that the end would be worth it. I am sad to say it was not, and consider the time I spent reading the book a colossal waste of time. I am disappointed in the time I wasted reading this book and am completely shocked by the positive reviews. I would strongly suggest to anyone thinking about reading this book to stay far, far away."
1,So Disappointed....,"I purchased this book after seeing it mentioned more than a few times as ""one of the funniest books"" people had ever read. I consider myself to have a pretty decent sense of humor, and love British wit, so really looked forward to this one. Read to page 200, had not had more than one tiny snicker, and gave up. This book will go into work into our ""free for the taking"" bookshelf where we trade off paperbacks."
1,Wow! I blew my money on this????,"Calling Neil Gaiman... Calling Neil Gaiman.... Where is Neil Gaiman? After reading much of Neil Gaiman's work, I seem to have stumbled upon what has to have been one of the worst novels I have ever had the displeasure of reading. Neil Gaiman, Clive Barker and many others have a knack for writing that makes you want to take the day off work just to keep reading. However, this novel was predictable, dull, and devoid of all characteristics that would make most of us want to keep reading.It has been some time since I have been compelled to write a review of a book, but I hope that this review can save even just one more person from wasting their time and money. Do yourself a favour and pick up ANY of Neil Gaiman's other work (WHICH IS FABULOUS I MUST SAY!), but leave this on the bookseller's shelf to collect dust rather than your own. They should give these away free!"
1,A let-down book with Terry Pratchett,"I read this book hoping to get the ""Colour of Magic"" or ""The Light Fantastic"" thrill of reading it, but was not impressed."
2,Wish I was British ... ...,"then perhaps I would have the comedic aptitude to absorb this book in its entirety. I won't say I didn't laugh aloud a few times (which in and of itself is probably enough reason to read the book), but I also scratched my head several times at some of the phrasing and flow of the story. But, people seem to enjoy it. I'm just not one of them."
3,enjoyable fluff,"Fun, easy, and mostly forgettable. Gaiman and Pratchett don't fall into the trap, like most writers in this genre, of relying on [too many] bad jokes and puns to hold up their story. The characters are enjoyable, though some of end up being a little underdeveloped. The story kind of flops about a bit at the end; what it needed, i think, is just a bit more time and care.All in all, though, rather enjoyable fluff."
5,The funniest book I've ever read!,"Read it. It is a rollicking rolling fun rise of a lifetime, with Pratchett's brilliant writing and Gaiman's twisted ideas meshing perfectly."
5,You will laugh until your sides split!!!,"People who do not enjoy this book must have had there humour surgically removed or have no friends and can't pull a member of the opposite sex, THAT'S how much i rate this book. I couldn't put this book down for a minute and frankly once i had read it, i read it again it was that good. The combination of dry wit and vaguely sly digs at the church had me in stiches from beginning to end. A shame that they have not written any more books together. A must read for anyone who likes either of these to writers!!"
5,ARMAGEDDON - '90'S STYLE!,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH... um, sorry, I have been laughing like this since I first reaad this book back in '92. You know about the Four Horsemen of the Apocolypse, but did you know about their greasy biker henchmen? Pratchett & Gaiman wrote a winner with this book. I may be burned at the stake for saying this (but I could always stuff my pockets with gun powder and nails) but in my opionion this is even funnier than Hitchhikers Guide to the Galxay. Read this book, if for no other reason than to laugh about the end of the world!"
5,So funny I forgot to breathe.,"I loved it so much, I have to buy another copy because I've re-read it and loaned it to so many people, my copy's worn out."
4,Great for some people,"I really liked this book, though I rather prefer Adams and Pratchett more on their own. However, they are my favorite authors (they're both british, how odd) and I was amazed to find they'd written a book together. The book is quite funny, but obviously, as some people have noted, it's not for everyone. In this book I think Pratchett's style comes across a little more than Gaiman's, though. Terry Pratchett is like Douglas Adams, only more Fantasy-based, and personally I think he's better. There are indeed large chunks of pointless blather--but while some people find them boring, I found them quite entertaining. so, obviously, while this is a very good book, it's not for the masses."
5,Fast Paced Comedy,"If you thought that by simply leaving Discworld Terry Pratchett's ability to make you laugh out loud would somehow change (Ok Ok, I know, but I thought it somehow would...or maybe I just didn't think about it and read this one on faith too), guess again! This story had me laughing out loud, to the consternation of family members who just don't get it, and that is Ok by me, because I have found a writer in whom I can trust when it comes to spending a moment in a world a little bit to the left of my own--or to the right...I don't know, I love him though!"
4,I never thought I'd like an antichrist,"I think it was the comparison to Hitchhiker's Guide that prompted me to purchase Good Omens and I'm glad I did. It's definatley a different kind of book, with the side notations and the references to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter. How is the Apocalyspe funny? You'll have to read it to believe it. I bet you like the antichrist, too."
5,A Re-readable classic,I won't offer any insight into the book's plot or characters. Other reviewers have presented those standard offerings. There is too much that I enjoy about this book to settle on any particular thing.I'll just say that no other book on my shelves is as cover-worn and dog-eared as this one. I happened to read it when it was first published and have opened it up again every couple of years since. It is simply a fun read. I heartily recommend it.
3,"Witty, funny, intelligent, but BORING.","Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors... i LOVED ""Neverwhere,"" ""Stardust,"" & ""American Gods."" But i just recently decided to read ""Good Omens,"" one of Gaiman's older works.It is a witty, humorous version of the apocalypse. I appreciate Gaiman & Pratchett's knowledge and creative attempt at the subject...However the book is very long-winded and hard to get through...And watch out Americans, you may not get some of the British humor... i think i missed some of it."
5,One of the best,"I've let over 10 of my friends borrow this book over the last nine years, and have had to re-buy about 5 copies to be able to hold onto a copy of my own. It's simply one of the funniest, most moving, most exciting, most re-readable books ever.Put simply: Try and find another book that as deftly ponders the meaning of being human, having free will, and what choices we are told to make in our moral lives day after day and can still make you laugh so hard milk comes out your nose."
4,What was God REALLY thinking?,"Yeah, it's hilarious, and yeah, comparisons to Hitchhiker'sGuide are inevitable, but, well, look. Forget 'Who Wrotethe Bible?' because this is it. The first chapter says itall. The humor is excellent, and the theme of the realitybehind the supposed war between heaven and hell is one thatGaiman has explored more than once; it's reminiscent of""Sandman: Season of Mists"" and the short story ""MurderMysteries"" (from the collection ""Angels and Visitations"").This is an ideal partnership and one that I, for one,applaud."
5,The funniest book I've ever read!,This book is a must read for anyone with an open mind and a warped sense of humor. It's laugh-out-loud-funny! I couldn't put it down!
3,OK - just,"Funny in a British kind of way, the silliness overshadows the good bits. OK for a once-only read, Gaiman's best books are elsewhere."
2,Dissipointed,"I thought there were many caraters that has nothing to do the plot. Just drag-out the story. I also struggle to keep up with all the caracters. I fount four caracter well planned, but the rest was just there. I lost the story plot. Could not understand what one chapter/caracter got to do with the other. There are a fiew funne lines, but not worth reading the whole book."
4,like Douglas Adams?,"This was an engaging book, more so than some of the author's other work. The narrator's voice is quite similar to Douglas Adams' (author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), with an equal measure of Vonnegut. It's a quick read, which to me is a sign of a good story. Very Postmodern for you literary types. Read it!"
5,Fantastic!!,"What a fun read!! This book is an absolute pleasure to read! A comedic take on the apocalypse certainly provides a unique and entertaining premise - especially when it is so well-executed! Be prepared to laugh out loud through the entire book (so you may not want to bring this one out in public - unless you don't mind getting some strange looks!). And if you are looking for a book to cheer you up - then please, pick up this one - who knew that the end of the world could provide so many laughs?And while the humour is great throughout the novel, it is the characters who really shine in this book. Honestly, I could not get enough of the sections with Crowley and Aziraphale - their relationship was one of the most fascinating in the book. It made for a super enjoyable read! I can definitely understand why this is considered a cult classic - and I am joining the many fans who have their fingers crossed in the hopes that this writing duo will team up again to write a sequel!"
3,3.5 stars,"If we had half stars I'd definitely give this one three and a half, it's more 7 out of 10 for me. I loved the basis for the book. I wish we could have spent more time with Aziraphale and Crowley, they were definitely my favourite characters, with Crowley just coming out on top. Some parts were really funny and the footnotes were very entertaining. Great, quick read."
5,This is in my Top 5 Best Books in the History of Ever.,"How anyone could not love this book is truly beyond my comprehension. I love Good Omens. Terry Pratchett's subtle and constant wit interwoven with Neil Gaiman's ability to compellingly describe the grim/gross/morbid/terrifying/apocalyptic makes for a truly fantastic book. I hope the Apocalypse really is this hilarious.I don't even know what else to say. I'm not that great at the review thing. I just LOVE this book. I have bought many, many copies and given them to friends, my love for this book is so deep that I feel I must share it with the people I care about. Or anyone, really. Just read it."
4,Remarkable collaboration,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I started this novel. I'm a fan of Neil Gaiman, but had only read one book by Terry Pratchett and had remembered not being that impressed (might be because I had inadvertently read a book in the middle of a series). This book really does have it all. There are parts that made me laugh out loud (which is very hard for me to do for some reason). There are parts that made me proud of human nature. Overall I was very impressed. Some times collaborations leave the reader confused and there are obvious transitions where one writer hands it over to the next. Not so in this book. It is seamless. Very well written and highly recommended."
4,The end of the world... as it should happen,"Quite possibly the funniest account of the Apocalypse ever written. If you can buy into the idea that the Spawn of Satan gets mixed up in a baby-switching caper, that the Four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse are not only alive and well, but among other capers marketing their own diet foods, and that the outcome of the eternal struggle between Good and Evil boils down to an angel and a devil who have more in common than they have different (including an appreciation of the good restaurants in London's West End) - then this book's for you.I have owned three copies of ""Good Omens"" up until now, and I have always passed them on, with the stipulation that the recipient do the same when they finished it. It's that sort of book- if it resonates with you, you'll want everyone you know to read it. If it doesn't, give it to somebody else just to get rid of it. Either way, you'll be doing somebody a favor."
2,I did not understand it,"I did not understand what this book was about. I do like Terry Pratchett a lot, but this book I did not like nor did I understand why he wrote it in the first place."
2,2 stars,"Have to agree with the previous writer. What a bust this book was, and it had the materials to be so much better. Aside from a couple guffaws and chuckles (in particularance towards the convolutination of the communicance of the perpelxinating military jargonance) this book was a bore, moved slowly, not as imaginative as it promises to be, and pages plodded by with nothing happening."
2,Hardly funny.,"A very ill advised descision by the authors to include such done to death concepts as from the point of view of angels in the modern world. That's why I hated the RPG ""In Nomine.""About the only main attempt at humor would ""Ha Ha look at these supposedly celestial beings, and they're holding up ordinary jobs, ha ha ha. How twisted is that?""If you want to see a funny parody of the apocalypse, check out the website: Apocamon the Final Judgement. It's no where near complete, but its free and its illistrated, and it's far more amusing."
2,skip it,"First, I've only read about 125 pages of this book so perhaps it has some dramatic improvements I'm missing...BUT overall it isn't very clever and it's rather uninteresting. There are pages of setup for jokes that fall flat. It's British so you may have trouble if you're American and don't know some British slang (Tubes are subways etc..) I have a pretty eclectic sense of humor and this book didn't appeal to any of the wide-ranging aspects of humor I appreciate- irony, sarcasm, wacky stuff, satire, wit, ..this had none worth mentioning."
1,no good omens,"Sorry to say that I thought this book was a waste of my money. I could not plow through it, and I rarely give up on any book. I couldn't find any sense in what was touted as a FUN read. Not for me."
3,Not laugh out loud funny but funny enough,"I just finished reading this and I have to say I'm surprised how many reviewers here say they've never laughed so much. Maybe they enjoyed a few pints while they read it. While I found it funny, I never broke out into laughter.Overall I'd say this was funny and intriguing enough that you'll be glad you read it, but you may find, like I did, that the climax & ending is a bit of a disappointment."
5,Brilliant. Just plain brilliant.,"And for some of the reviewers, Neil Gaiman did not write this book alone, he did not come up with all of the characters and stories. Neither did Terry Pratchett. That's why the names of both authors are on the cover. Oh, and don't send Neil Gaiman any money, he's just trying to leech off you... And Pratchett is by now bored stiff of banana daiquiris...(I'm sure he would enjoy some Scumble more...it's made from apples...well...mainly apples...)"
1,lid doesn't fit,"Skillet is not bad, but the lid does not fit. It is one of those with serveral inside rings made to fit any skillet, and really fits no skillet ever made. I ordered it nearly a month before my sisters birthday, and after they changed the delivery dates several times, she finally received the inferior product a couple weeks AFTER HER BIRTHDAY, AND THEN IT WAS A DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT. Caveat emptor!"
4,Keep in the car,This book was great to have when I went to Canada. It gave me a lot of information on the places I wanted to see and places I did not know about. The authors sure know their way around.
3,Thought it would be sturdier,"I use this in a carpeted office and store a smallish printer and a few peripherals on it. It's in a closet, and I bought it because I wanted to be able to roll it out when I'm doing print jobs, and stow it away when it's not being used. Problem is twofold: the casters don't roll very well on the carpet. With the resistance I get rolling on the carpet, I have to pull the table harder to get it to move. This causes the whole frame of the table to shift and pivot at the joints. The product description didn't provide any guidance as to how much weight it can bear but I would think a 45 pound table could hold a 20 pound printer without an issue. So I really don't use it much as originally intended. Without the carpet I think it would still be not quite sturdy enough. In any event, the powder coating is pretty decent and it has nice clean lines. Would recommend for light duty use only."
4,A childhood favorite,"I watched this repeatedly as a small child, and I grew up to earn a Master's degree in American History! Coincidence? Probably. But maybe not!_Ben and Me_ tells the captivating tale of a mouse who ""helps"" Benjamin Franklin as he creates some of his most famous inventions. It really does give kids a taste of history in a fun and accessible way. As for the reviewer who is wrapped around the axle about it making Franklin look incompetent...well, let's just say that I think the average six-year-old has a better grasp of reality than the reviewer gives them credit for.I still have my original VHS recording from when I was small, but I came here looking for a DVD version to share with my kids for the 4th of July. Unfortunately, one doesn't seem to exist, so I guess we'll be borrowing a VCR from Grandma instead."
5,Excellent!!!,This is the best bass cd I have ever heard and am so glad that I finally got my hands on a copy!!
4,The kindThisEnjoyable bass music.,This album is never going to get old. The mixes are A+. It's the kind of bass that brings you through an adventure. Leaves you with goose bumps. 4 stars cause some mixes arent as good as others. But they all have that bass you can show off in your vehichle.TechMaster is the master! Dynamix II is next best thing.
2,Would work if made better,used this item on 3 weddings rubber grip that helps hold flach in place came unglued. the off camera trigger comes lose all the time. The lock that holds camre in horizontal place broke!!!
3,"Classic tale, awkward translation","Scarlet Sails is one of the classic tales I remember since childhood and will always have a special place in me. It's one of the most romantic stories I know.I read this English edition just recently. Two things jumped out, one, the leading lady's name is Asole; two, the translation is really awkward, if a drowning man calls to me ""You hear me! I'm perishing!"", I would let him die too."
3,Questionable Quality,"The 10 Key design is a life saver. I'm using these in my restaurant, unfortunately they're more suitable for home use. The timers are not loud enough for commercial use unless your kitchen is not very loud. I also had to to re-bend the battery contacts for a tighter fit on two of the 3 timers that I bought, because they would shut-off during use. Only have had them for about 3 weeks, so let's see how well they hold up. Despite the shortfalls, they're keepers due the Convenience of the 10 Key function.Update: Used the timers for several months now, and they're definitely not for heavy use. Home use should be OK, but we've killed them all. The buttons don't work well anymore and the sound is weakened or doesn't beep anymore. We'll have to upgrade to heavy duty 10-key commercial ones. Nice try though..."
1,"No, no, no, no",We have bought four of these. None has lasted a year.We liked the big buttons and the flat design.We don't like filling the landfills.Let's buy a well-made American one next.
2,Not for the professional kitchen,"We've chewed through several of these timers at our restaurant. They just don't hold up to heavy use. Here is a summary of issues we've had: screen blanks out; alarm fails to go off when times runs out; alarm chirps randomly and incessantly (this one was broken in half before being thrown away); the buttons get easily gummed up and stick. Plus, there is no easy way to change the battery. I'm assuming you have to remove the tiny screws in the back but we've never had one last long enough for the battery to run out."
2,Not so good...,"I run lots of groups and I wanted a timer that was louder than most. Well, this one is louder, but there is little else I can recommend it for. I actually purchased two of these timers about 7 months ago, and have used them interchangeably, so neither has had much wear and tear. Nonetheless, there seems to be some kind of electrical malfunction at times, especially when I'm trying to set it - it often goes back to zero. Sometimes it just blanks out all together. Another problem is that the numbers on the buttons wear away very quickly. The two magnets affixed to the back are handy for putting it on metal surfaces, but one or both magnets fell off of both timers within the first couple months! In short, this timer is a pain in the neck!"
2,Falls off the fridge,"The biggest problem with this timer is its weak and unstable magnet mount. The unit moves when you press the buttons because the unit isn't flat enough to stick firmly. I had to put some plastic kitchen door bumpers on the back to stabilize it. As for the timer features, it is a rather loud unit. Maybe that's good for some, but it's pretty harsh. The buttons are nice and big, but hard to push. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,"decent design, poor execution","I was looking for a timer with a keypad for entering digits, instead of up and down arrows, and I chose this one. Unfortunately, the buttons do not work consistently. Pressing a button can result in zero, one, or two digits. The outcome appears to be random. For example, you can press ""3"" and ""0"" hoping for 30 seconds and end up with 3 minutes (3-0-0) or 3 minutes and 30 seconds (3-3-0). Replacement batteries cost as much as the timer itself. I would not buy this timer again."
1,Terrible Timer,"I have used several timers and use them throughout the day almost every day. I bought four of these because they were inexpensive. I was disappointed to find that the last time set does not reset when the timer signal sounds, a feature that other timers have. Also the signal gets scratchy or static-y at times. One of the magnets fell off the back of one and the stands have two positions, one of which they don't remain in very well.Overall, I am disappointed and will not purchase these again. I think Pampered Chef makes the best timer, but was looking for something more reasonably priced, especially since my children use them as well."
3,Could be a lot better,"They started out right. It has a nice shape and large, legible letters then they added a cheap, flimsy piece of plastic at the bottom that will break off the first time the timer is dropped of falls on the floor as they do. Would not buy again."
1,Lasted less than a year,"After about 9 months, started to fail. Replaced battery (the button type -- not cheap) and it worked well again for about a month. Then it started working erratically before finally kicking the bucket. Not worth even its cheap price."
1,"Poor battery life, no on/off switch,weak magnets",I got this for Christmas and it's only January and the batteries already need to be replaced.There is no on/off switch so the timer is always on reducing battery life or maybe the batteries were marginal when I bought it.Replacement batteries cost more than the timer.Magnets don't hold timer very well.
4,Timer,I Received it in perfect condition and the delivery was faster than I expected. I like the product... only inconvienient will change the battery because of the scrow.
2,disappointing!,"Once time has elapsed and the beeps are shut off, time is reset to zero. If you are doing a repetitive activity, the time needs to be re-entered each time. Thus, for this purpose, the timer is not satisfactory."
3,works well for my purposes,"I use this mainly as a nap alarm, as my rare clock with a nap alarm died. Please be aware that this has a fold out stand on the back for table use, as well as magnets. I like the large number key pad, but can't comment on durability as have had only a few weeks. I can see that it is really too big and poorly designed to be a good frig timer. It needs an additional magnet just above the battery door to provide good balance when the lower digits are pushed. Also, unlike some timers, your time clears when you push the stop button. If you use the same time frequently all day, this is an inconvenience. The Acurite 10 key pad timer lacks these problems and can also be clipped to a rather thin object. Also, it uses a AAA battery, easily replaced. However, the digit buttons are much smaller. Take your pick."
2,"Works, but you will be disappointed.","It does what it says it will do but has 3 major problems that make it an instant return.1) The 2 magnets on the back are not strong enough to even hold it to the refrigerator - it slides right off.2) The plastic kickstand could not possibly be of a cheaper quality. It does not hold the weight of the device.3) The LED screen can only be seen at a direct facing angle, meaning that if you are using the kickstand, the device needs to be at shoeshine level.Impractical."
4,taylor timer,"bought original timer from sur la table. easy to use, with a loud beeper. one just ordered o,k., but beeper's not as loud.possibly weak batteries? I did have to add more stick- on magnets to back so it won't tip when setting numbers while onrefrigerator."
2,just okay,"The numbers are nice and big on the timer as well as the display. However, the buttons are hard to push and the stand for it puts it at a very odd angle as well. Pretty flimsy stand, but it does have some magnets on the back (but unless I were to put it on the fridge it won't work - for me).It has a stop/clear as well as a start button. I had a timer in the past that had a stop/clear button and once the timer went off - if you hit the stop/clear button once it would stop the beeping and reset the timer to where you had it set at (which is what I need) and this one does not do that. It just stops the beeping and resets to 0.I wish the back battery compartment on my old one hadn't worn out (just plastic and the little tabs would not secure the battery any more) so I didn't have to get a replacement - just can't find a good replacement for that one."
5,The softer side of P.E.B.,"This is my favorite P.E.B. album. I have always been more of a fan of his melodic compositions and this one is filled with them. Nearly every track on this album is beautiful and relaxing. This album doesn't have as much bass as his other albums, but I don't like Techmaster P.E.B. for the bass, I like him for the music.If anybody knows what is going on with P.E.B. these days, please let me know!!"
4,Good book,The book provides a good way to discuss relationship issues with your teenage girl. We use the book with a team of teenage girls.
5,I installed it on my MacBook Pro under Boot Camp. Runs really fast!,"I didn't take off stars for Basic's lack of features, unlike other reviewers, because Microsoft advertised Basic without them. You can't fault Basic for things that you were forewarned on before buying it. Instead, I awarded it five stars because of its flawless adherence to the capabilities I was told it has.I find that most people don't use any of Vista's features that aren't on Basic. For most people, Windows Vista Home Basic is all they need but they just don't want to have the bottom-of-the-line product. I found it to be very proficient at handling the tasks even computer nerds do.Believe it or not, Windows Aero can be done without. Basic's graphics are good, too, and they look much better than XP's.Overall, this product will fill the needs of the vast majority of users, and it's a cost-effective way to stay updated with the latest technology. I'm very pleased with it."
1,Dead DOG!! - Don't even think about running games,"This Dog don't hunt! it can't even run basic graphic games worth a hoot.Just ""Pista"" away lots of money on a new system with 1.5gig of mem and 256 pci-ex video and can't even run CS or DOD.Wow thanks for the 5 year wait on this junk.Now I've got to buy XP again. Can't downgrade Lic."
2,Vista Is Slow,I am very disappointed in Vista. It took about 12 hours to install and now my computer is extremely slow. I would absolutely NOT recommend it.
1,No Refunds with This Product,"I tried writing a review on this product and it did not pass the approval process to be displayed by Amazon Customers, Why? I have reviewed many products without being rejected. I was not cursing or saying bad things about this vendor, Just the Truth. I would give this Vendor a rating of 0 if possible. Let's see if Amazon would let a low review be seen by Amazon Customers? Will not buy from this Vendor Ever!"
1,Good media but no working serial!,Who ever sold it to me didn`t uninstalled from his system! So when I tried to activate it would not activate. Only buy it if you lost your original media!
1,Buyer Beware,"The product key was invalid or did not match DVD supplied, hence could not install software. I would not recommend buying this!"
2,NOT WORTH THE PRICE!,"The CD was a little more than ""slightly used"". It would not upgrade in either of my computers even though my machines met all of the requirements. Now I'm stuck with a $50.00 useless CD. I can't even give it away. Literally."
5,Vista is excellent,"i have built three computers in the last 15 months. all running Vista [home basic and premium] using both Intel and AMD chipsets. no hardware issues. even i have been very happy with Windows XP, i prefer Vista mainly because of the features/functions Vista offers [sleep function and automatically installing drivers for most hardwares--LAN, graphic card, printer, scanner, etc.]. i can't understand why so many people [of course, mainly the Mac supporters] hate Microsoft products."
1,Sorry to see XP go...,"I installed this after doing everything that I was supposed to do before installation. It messed up my computer and I had to have XP reinstalled, now you can't buy XP anymore and I am sorry to see it go. Vista, I wish you would go."
4,Windows Vista,Windows Vista Home Basic uses my Celeron D based computer fast with software for Dual Processor. I just had to make the folders usable in the beginning of Vista use...
2,Installing on Mac OS with Parralel Desktop ?,"Hi,Does it work for installing Microsoft Windows Vista Home Basic UPGRADE [DVD] on new Macbook Pro after installing a Parralel Desktop.3. ????please advisewith many thanks."
1,Nooooooo .... don't do it .... you'll be soooooo SORRY!!!,"Remember how nice and stable Windows 98SE was? It took me forever to get comfortable with Windows XP Pro. Okay, so after a couple of years, XP Pro and I are finally reasonably comfortable with each other. Now I buy a laptop that comes with Vista Home and I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT!!! Go ahead. Ignore me. Update. But don't say that I didn't warn you!!!"
3,I didn't keep this product,"I don't know how this product performed, because I sent it back,and purchased a new Gateway Computer,and it had Windows vista Premium alreadyinstalled."
1,XP Professional Cannot be Upgraded with Vista Home Basic,"Please note that the notes under ""Product Features"" are incorrect. You cannot ""upgrade"" from XP Professional to Vista Home Basic with this DVD. You will be prompted early in the upgrade process that XP Pro can only be upgraded to Vista Business, Enterprise, or Ultimate. You are however given the option to do a ""clean install"" of Vista Home Basic, thus wiping out all your software and files.Not good Microsoft -- people want to know the details before they order!"
2,Can't dual boot,You can not use this version to do a clean install in a different partition than your XP SP2. If you want to run both XP and Vista you must buy a full edition version. XP allowed you to do this.
2,Beginning Vista,"These days, everybody has a computer, most of them are Windows XP compatable. Surprisingly, Microsoft recently made a lot of hype with their next edition of lone-lasting Windows, the Windows Vista. The operating system has had a lot of momentum, but sadly when I tried the upgrade of the system, it didn't really work as good as Windows XP did. Although there are a lot of great features here like Windows Media Player 11, and the new Internet Explorer 7 with a specialized filter that scan for phishing and identity theft. Sadly, the loading time is much, much slower than my other operating systems, and a lot of programs that are Windows XP capable, aren't really working properly with the new operating system. If you have a computer that is capable with Windows Vista's compatability, you are definitely better off passing it up, and sticking with your current operating system for now.Price: C-Convience: DExtras: D+Overall: D"
1,You don't get what you pay for,"This order is fulfilled by ""Nothing But Software"" but they don't send you a retail box version. They sent me a DVD snap case with the words ""Service Desk Upgrade"" on it.I'm not sure what this is so I have to return it."
3,Leak resistant?,"These work great for things like sandwiches, burgers, lightly dressed salads, etc. They're a good buy, and certainly good for the environment.But my experience has been that they do not do at all well with anything ""sloppy"" or juicy. Spaghetti with meat sauce: the juice from the sauce leaked through. Broiled chicken: the juices leaked through. Cole slaw: the dressing leaked through.So if you're planning to use these mostly for casual eating, where nothing too ""liquid"" is involved, these will work beautifully. Otherwise, you're probably better off using a ""coated"" paper plate."
5,Great Paper plates,"My husband and I are both in our early eightys. I have been using paper plates for us for sometime. I decided to order a bunch of them, so I would not have to look for them in the grocery store. We do not shop because of back problems. This makes it so much nicer to order on line. These paper plates are very nice and can be used in the microwave."
3,"""Green"" disposable plates??","These are perfectly decent, average-quality ""paper"" plates. How disposable plates can be considered eco-friendly, though, and why these are more so than most other such plates, are mysterious."
3,Good Plates for Lunchtime Use,"Good for foods that are not liquid or greasy like lunch sandwiches. These are pressed ""paper"" plates made from Sugar Cane Fiber and are very similar to ""Chinet"" paper plates. The big difference is that these come all the way from China while Chinet plates are made from recycled material in the U.S. and are biodegradable in home composting.So WHY are the Stalkmarket plates eco-friendly? Why not get Chinet plates locally since they are cheaper and are more eco-friendly since they aren't shipped around the world? I'm no environmental scientist but I don't think these plates are eco-friendly especially since there are better alternatives."
2,Good kitchen timer - not for all purposes,"I purchased to use in the classroom, however it beeps whenever you press a button. For example, to to set the timer for 10 minutes it beeps 11 times - once for each minute, and once when you press the start button. Very annoying, and no way to shut off the volume. This would be great in the kitchen!"
3,"Average, but inexpensive","I purchased this timer because I wanted an inexpensive timer for my basement. I groom my cats there and need to time some of the grooming products I use on the cats. This timer arrived with the clip broken on the back. It is the part that attaches to you belt or can make the timer stand upright. Amazon let me print out a return label so that I didn't have to pay for return shipping charges and they sent me out a replacement immediately. The replacement was fine. For the price, this timer is pretty good."
1,Not what a timer should be,Beeping sound is barely audible and therefore a useless timer if you need a signal when the time is up.
1,They shouldn't be allowed to advertise the magnet part,"The timer, with battery, weighs more than the magnet can hold. The timer fell off the refridgerator and smashed onto the floor, apparently causing a rift in time as it is now counting only 1 second per millenium."
1,This is a disappointing timer,"This timer is a disappointment. A key feature of a count-down timer is the alarm. The alarm on the 5807 is inaudible beyond 10 feet. Say, you set the time for one hour and then do something else. At the end of the hour you cannot hear the alarm go off. So, you do not know that the time is up.Another poor feature is that the timer can be set for either hours and minutes or for minutes and seconds. It cannot be set for hours, minutes, and seconds.I intend to look for a better kitchen timer."
2,Not Impressed!,"This timer is fairly big and clunky. The large display is nice but the buttons are akwardly placed. It has a clip on the back so you can clip it on something, and on the back of the clip is a magnet. I have mine on the fridge hung by the magnet. if you want to set the timer, you have to take it down, otherwise, as soon as you hit a button, the timer tips and falls down. Also not certain how it is a double timer. It counts up or down. I was under the impression it could keep two timers running...not the case."
2,Disappointing after its trial run,"I agree with some of the other reviews. My main gripes about this product are:* beeps everytime you push a button* difficult to reset to zero without starting the ""count up"" timer* not very loud when it reaches the count-down to zero time* it keeps sliding to the bottom of my refrigerator door! Argh!PROS:* it was better than CATS (not much of a recommendation)./\_/\.(='.'=)("")_("")"
5,Good timer!,"I bought one and I'm about to buy one more. It's very convenient for me who often forget to do something. You can set the countdown timer to remind you after a few minutes or hours.If you need to take a nap, you can set the countdown timer to wake you up after tens of minutes. If you use a normal alarm clock, you must calculate the time.Besides, it can be used as a digital clock. What a pity that it does not have light for using at night."
5,Better than expected,It worked great before we left it one the grill and it got rained on....and it is still working just as well after being rained on.
5,Great Bathing suit!,This bathing suit is just a really good solid bathing suit. Really enjoy using it. I would definitely recommend it.
3,"Comfy, but lacks support","I teach water aerobics and swim lessons on a weekly basis. I swim and participate in water aerobics on my own as well. This suit is very comfortable, but it lacks breast support. There is a thin shelf bra, but it doesn't do much. If it weren't for the very thin built-in bra, there would be no support. I carry low and find it a little baggy between my belly and breasts. I would not purchase this garment for water aerobics. The suit is great for teaching swim lessons and ok for lap swimming."
4,Very comfortable,"Although the suit isn't very attractive or flattering, I wanted a cheap, simple suit with shoulder straps rather than a halter strap (very uncomfortable). The suit is pretty much just very basic but very comfy. So if you're after style this isn't for you. Practicality & comfort are it's top points."
5,Sinufix,I heard Doctor Bob Martin recommend this product on his radio show. I have been bothered with sinus problems since moving to AZ and thought I would give Sinufix a try. It is great and have been using it now for several years. It is a natural product and doesn't cause any side affects and can be used several times a day with no problem. I am thrilled I can buy it through Amazon because the health food store where I used to purchase it no longer carries Sinufix. Hope this encourages someone to use it because the product really works.
5,True Sinus Blaster,"I have tried just about everything for the relief of sinus pressure and pain and nothing works as well as Sinufix. I do not use it as directed, rather, when my sinuses are clogged and causing me pain, I squirt one squirt in each nostril and then repeat every 20 minutes for one hour (three separate applications) and it works every time! My aunt, who suffers from sinus infections, just tried it (my way) and claims that it will even work during a full infection."
4,Sound good,"I bought them to replace my Koss headphones which just simply make my ears and head sweat. These don't sound as good as the Koss, but they're ok, and much lighter. Have to wait until summer to find out how they handle the heat."
2,Descending to Boredom,"I wish I could recommend this book because Mr. Wurst undoubtedly has an interesting story to tell, he just didn't tell it well. It lacks specifics and fails to draw you into his story, reading much like pages from a diary. Too dry, too general, too boring. If this book were a parachute it would fail to open."
1,Ravensburger Puzzle,"My daughter is learning disabled and loves puzzles. They are great for hand-eye coordination, focus, and many more skills we are trying to strengthen. This would have been fantastic; however, the largest puzzle she can do is 100 pieces and that's difficult. I had ordered a 50 piece puzzle which was the description and which is what I thought I was getting. This puzzle was a 500 piece puzzle which she will never be able to use. It would be helpful to ensure you are listing things correctly.What could have been a great learning toy is now just wasted space because the pieces are too small and there are too many. It's unusable in this situation."
5,This thing is great!!!,"I just bought this earlier today, I have burned 3 DVD-R's with no trouble. I have only been able to burn at 4x because that is the max on my media. I am very satisfied so far. It installed easy, and it came with a great software package. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a top of the line DVD Burner."
2,Waste of Money,"Waste of money not 320. It sounds muffled in a system, buyers beware.I do not recommend. Should have to advertise bit rate."
2,Big and Dangerous,"The JWIN JA-C82 1000ma 110/220v AC-DC adapter is big, hefty and potentially dangerous. It's about the size and shape of a women's fist. Disappointing considering modern AC-DC 110/220v adapters that come with my travel electronics are much lighter. The scary part is that you'll have to figure out the DC polarity before plugging in. Not an easy task. Get it wrong and you might toast your electronics.If you're an international electronics guru, this can be a bargain value."
4,Current,"Note first of all that this book, though out of print, is available online; it is one of the first items to be googled under 'psychology occult'. The writing of this book is careful and upfront. The author's assumptions and intentions are well stated in the preface, and read with those in mind, the book is a useful resource for anyone interested in the (Jungian) psychological dumensions of the kabbalah and hermeticism. However, note that psychology here is strictly limited to Jungian psychology. The author does discuss modern psychology briefly only to dismiss it for its supposed dismissal of the unconscious. This is not true and never was true, although some schools of thought did do so those schools never completely dominated the entire field of psychology. A newer treatise on the subject from someone with more insight into other psychological theories would be most interesting."

2,Dissapointed,This wasn't what i was expecting after listening to El amor de mi Tierra which was excellent. A bit too slow and 'lovey dovey' for my taste.
1,My opinion of Vista,"I recently bought a new laptop and it came equipped with Vista. I was very excited to try the new operating system so I went home, opened the box, and turned on the computer. It took at least five minutes to get the thing running after I entered all of my info, so I thought mabye it was a one time start up thing. I messed around a bit and realized that everything was going so slow! I decided to restart the computer in hopes that mabye it was just because it was the first time that it had been on. I was wrong. Once again it took forever to start up and then continued to run very slowly. Yesterday I sent it off to get downgraded to XP. In my opinion Vista is not a practical way to run your computer. Yes, it is very pleasing aesthetically, but that is not what a computer is about. I definitely do not recommend this product."
4,From a Mac user,"I switched from the windows XP platform to the mac OS about a year ago. I am a graphic designer so we're all supposed to have macs, if we don't; we are shunned. Anyways, I had to purchase a pc for general office use, and of course it came packaged with vista. In all honesty, I really don't mind vista, in fact, I like it. Mostly because it's a very pretty OS, it has more than looks though (or so i'm told). My roomate is in the Geek Squad at best buy and told me that it's the stuff that you can't see happening that makes vista great. All in all, it's prettier than than Mac's tiger, but not as easy to use and i'm sure when leopard comes out vista won't be lookin so hot. The only gripe i have is that after five years Microsoft's new OS should have been mind blowing, I guess you have to leave innovation the the folks at Apple. Immitation is the greatest form of flatery."
1,Think twice about MS Vista,"I asked Dell to include XP Professional instead of Vista in my new laptop, but it apparently was not an option. I am extremely disappointed with Vista. I reminds me of the old days with Apple where almost every operation had to be restarted. First of all, Vista is slow, slow. It is so overloaded that it has chronic indigestion. It will randomly rearranges your desktop icons, it updates in the middle of jobs and will not go away until you have sat through the upgrade/restart process. There are constant interruptions as it works its way through corrections and randomly quits programs for "" unexpected shutdowns."" XP is a great operating system, stay with it."
1,The worst Windows since Millenium,"After trying it on three computers I have to say that this is the absolute worst version of Windows since ME, quite possibly WORSE. On all systems I have been plagued with system hangs, crashes, waiting minutes for a window to open and problem after problem where windows can't find included files (the windows\system32 folder is filled with garbage). I have now done away with over $600 worth of licences and gone back to XP because at least with XP I can be sure my computer will work again the next time I turn it on."
1,"Vista, Poor Product, Poor Servicwe",Vista does not work well at all! Microsoft will not support there own product. Most digital Cams & scanners doe not work. Programs which worked with windows 98 dot not run. The product is junk. Do not buy it!
3,Average at best,"May end up being a good operating system down the road, but wait until fall to buy it. Looks nice, love the folder views for music and pictures, and media center works well for the most part. MAJOR point, does NOT support dynamic disks!!! I'm still trying to recover my media hard drive with another computer. Read ahead of time that Media Center should be able to record in AVI now; haven't found that one. Sound was totally rewritten for Vista so that it cannot access the shell. Great for the future, bad for now. Sound crashes occasionally. Graphic drivers do the same, make sure you have a top of the line video card. Overall if you can deal with gremlins in your computer, go ahead and buy. GL."
3,Not the best windows OS,"I have purchased this OS to build a new computer system, I find it nothing but frustrating. first, Many of the current software apps are incompatible, software companies are very slow to provide compatible programs, this system is very annoying, requiring aproval of every little single action you perform on the system, even though you are logged in as administrator. I removed the system my home computer,and continue using windows XP system and simply use it for gaming until microsoft provides a service pack to make this system presentable for usersMicrosoft Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit for System Builders[DVD]"
3,5 years for this ?,I have been a beta tester for awhile now and all I can say is where is the ' next generation ' os ? Yes it looks nice but thats just window dressing.... The 4 flavors option is dumb.the best way to upgrade is to buy a new hard drive and do a separate install - do not buy the ' upgrade ' version it will kill your XP license!! If your not going to change your motherboard anytime soon then buy the OEM version (available at newegg or other build it yourself sites) this version is tied to your motherboard and will not transfer but who cares because your gonna save like 130 bucks.This one license stuff is troubling - this price should include at least 2 or 3 licenses. Very disappointing.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!,"This is the worse OS that I have ever worked with. I am sick and tired of fighting with it everytime I just want to rename a file. (the pointer keeps changing into a ""clock"" and booting me out of the prompt). I ASSume that its the indexer, but am tired of dealing with it and the many other things this joke of an OS does to use up resources. (btw, I bought a very highend system that had vista home premium preloaded)Dont get vista!!"
1,Windows Vista Home version,"I recently purchased a new computer on which Vista was loaded. For your own good if you have XP stay with it as long as you can.- In the years I had XP I had next to no lockups. Lockups are an almost daily event with Vista.- Much of the software of other vendors is incompatible with Vista. Occasionally Vista will warn you before you install the software but many times it does not and you suffer the consequences.- At times if you need to stop a program using the Taskmaster, the Taskmaster window will not appear.- There are times when you try to shut down the system but the system locks up.There are numerous problems with this OS but enough to say that it is just one rung above Microsoft's Millenium!"
1,MS Office 2003 Vista Problems,"Was told that MS Office 2003 will not work with Vista, my computer has crashed 3 times in the last week, so I guess I will hope MS Office 2007 will work with it - I bought a Dell and they did not give me the option of getting XP with it.I have had the computer for about a week now and there appears to be nothing great about the Vista OS."
4,"Pretty Good OS for the money, don't get what the fuss is about","I bought a new computer w/ Vista home premium and i think it is an above average system. Mom gets annoyed because she has worked with computers since before DOS and hates the overly graphical GUI. Vista is slightly harder to index files with because they created the OS for joe bloes who can't figure out anything in a computer, a detriment to anyone with actual experience. The computer has a 320 gig harddrive and 2 gig RAM and runs very smoothly. But when i first checked the drives, it showed that i only had 277 of 320 gigs left after just booting the system. I found out that Vista itself is like 10 gigs, and it automatically creates a 30-odd gig backup drive. while this feature is good in the future for when you accidentaly screw something up, it just eats up space for the meantime.In short, Vista is a good OS, just remember that it needs the right equipment."
4,"For what I do, it's an excellent choice","I don't do a whole lot of computer work, mostly just gaming, watching movies and using Microsoft Office, but since getting my new computer that came with Vista, I haven't encountered anything unusual. For what I do, pros are the organization of the windows and how I can preview the program before maximizing the image. I also appreciate the organization of programs and documents when I am working. The only problem I've encountered has been when I've tried to use a program not necessarily compatible with Vista.Most of the issues I've encountered weren't necessarily with Vista, but rather the computer, which was easy enough to solve. It's been said before, but if you're going to upgrade to Vista, do alot of research to see if it's what you need and make sure the programs you have will be compatible."
1,Tried it. Hated it. Buy a Mac.,"Okay, I'm a Mac-user, but I purchased a Dell laptop to resolve ""a couple"" of small compatibility issues. Big mistake. Vista is a bad copy of Apples OS X. I will live with the small issues and return the Dell laptop - plus the design and build of the machine was second-rate compared to a Mac. Eventually I partitioned the hard drive on my Mac and ran Windows XP successfully. While I still favor the Mac OS, XP was a better ""downgrade"" than Vista."
2,Ametuer Night at the OS'es!,"Abismal aptempt to copy Mac OSX!Admit it, MS is behind the times and a dollar short."
1,A Labyrinth of the Mundane,"I don't really approve of this operating system. My principal objection is to the lack of anything resembling a coherent user interface. Where, one wishes to know, are the pulldown menus? Rather than enforce a standard scheme in all applications, Microsoft has abandoned tradition as well as competant administration, and left its operating system in a state of bewildering anarchy. Not since King Lear has a sovereign committed so grave an abdication of his rightful authority. Once-familiar commands are now scattered to strange corners of the screen, or concealed within vague iconographies, that, like the private languages of malevolent gods, condemn mortals to perpetual confusion. To submit to the indiscipline of Windows Vista is to wander lost in a labyrinth of the mundane."
1,Well at least I'm not alone,"What a load of Cheese Whiz(tm) this OS is. I ended up installing XP over it after a few days of struggle.If that was the best Microsoft could do, then Unix and Mac have good times ahead, market share wise. If I didn't have to run some very vertical-market applications, I'd probably dump Windows(tm) all-together."
3,No 64 Bit Version,"I am very disappointed there is no 64 bit version. I read everything I could find on the Microsoft website pre-release date and nothing said you would need to order a separate Dvd. Microsoft is just trying to be cheap. I hope they get a class action Law suite. I am very disappointed that Amazon did not let me know I was not getting the 64 bit version. I did look at other sites and they said they only had the 32 bit version. The other site had a better price, but it looked like Amazon was shipping the 64 bit version with the 32 bit. Surprise, Amazon should pay its customers for the 9.95 to get the 64 bit version until they update there site with correct description of Home Premium. I am unhappy."
2,Does not play well with others.,"Again, the 'Lord of the OS' proves that it's their ball and you need to play their way. I have one test machine at home running Vista (Business ver), and have configured the Home Premium version for a couple of friends. Main things I've noticed: 1) Don't expect third party software and Vista to play well together - conflicts are us! 2) Be VERY careful when applying any driver updates from Microsoft Update service - have NOT had good luck with most of these, even though hardware is 'VISTA Certified'. 3) Restore points are your friend - you'll visit with them often.I won't reiterate most of what others have said about the paint on the barn or the requirement bloat. For my real work I'll stick with my XP-SP2 and Solaris boxes - Vista is at LEAST a SP down the road from workability. Save the headache and WAIT."
1,Pay no attention to the OS behind the curtain . . .,"OK it's new, and even change agents don't REALLY like change - so Vista has encountered some push-back. But even if we could adjust for resistance to change, Vista probably still wouldn't be very popular. The reason in a nutshell is that Vista's interface is neither intuitive nor consistent with previous versions, making it hard to get anything of any complexity whatsoever accomplished (try setting up a wireless network connection). A new and illogical interface could possibly be tolerated if a good printed manual were available, but documentation typically is electronic. The ""are you sure you want to do this?"" popups are annoying at first. But since there are so many of them, people quickly learn to blow by them without even looking, which renders them totally ineffective. All in all, Vista users are going to face a stiff learning curve for little if any benefit. I think that Microsoft has really painted themselves into a corner this time."
1,Vista schmista...,"Like many others I had no choice but the Vista operating system when I purchased my new HP. I have had nothing but problems. Computer crashes,lost files - particularly pictures(they are there somewhere - just try to find them though!, weird copies that I never purposely made showing up all over the place. I'm not a ""techie"" - but really, aren't these operating systems supposed to be somewhat intuitive for the normal user out there? I have never had a problem figuring out how to use XP or any other Windows operating system on any of my other computers over the years. I have basic computing needs and I want something easy and intuitive to use. If you want the same things I want - forget Windows Vista for now. Wait for the next version - it will be coming in a couple of years no doubt!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,"Vista is a nightmare! I can't use software that I have because it will not install, and I can't add some Adobe software that I would like because it isn't compatible. My three month old computer is slower than my three year old computer, thanks to Vista. Going on-line is a pain, all kinds of weird things happen. I have contacted HP to see if Vista could be removed and replaced with XP - can't be done. Just checked to see if I could buy a new laptop with XP, virtually impossible. Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves for putting this truely horrible product into almost every available computer."
2,Pure Frustration and Confusion,"WOW. This OS is a PAIN. I agree with everyone here on the bad things about it. I (like many) had to get Vista b/c it was what Sony is using in their new laptops. I'm considering going back to XP. I'm hoping there is some way to tone down the security settings so that everytime I try to download something I don't get prompted ""Are you reallly sure you want to download this?"" YES I'M SURE OR ELSE I WOULDN'T HAVE CLICKED SAVE TO DOWNLOAD!! And WHY did they decide to move things around and change names?? It takes me twice as long now to do anything because I have to re-discover how to do it! It's so hard when you've been using Windows your whole life and it's been relatively the same and then all of the sudden this shows up.Like i said... pure furstration and confusion."
2,Come on?,"The comments given here are all very correct. VISTA is visually better but that is about it and at what cost? Stick to XP Pro for now, if Microsoft overhauls this software on the expected service pack it maybe worth getting but for now it is hard to work with and it moves us close to ""Big Brother""."
1,"Throw your money in the garbage, you'll be happier than installing this OS","This is pretty much the buggiest and slowest OS ever built. How on earth does one spend billions of dollars creating an OS that is a step BACKWARDS from XP? Stay on XP as long as possible, and when you need to upgrade computers, switch to Mac. It'll be another decade before Microsoft gets around to releasing an OS that represents an improvement over XP."
4,"Don't believe the haters, Vista works fine if....","First, it is obvious if you read through all of the reviews that you need a computer that can handle it. My Dell N250 laptop from 2003 could never run it but I recently purchased a Dell XPS system and it looks and works great. I originally asked Dell if I could get the XPS with XP but you cannot so I decided to take a chance. I had heard so much compaining about compatibility issues that I was worried but I have actually found that all of my peripherals loaded better than they ever did with XP. My all in one printer is finally fully functional!One piece of advice, read the software for devices you are adding in advance before you try and load it. If it doesn't say Vista don't load it, go to the manufacturers site and download it. I found that in 9 out of 10 instances though Vista already had the drivers. I added my printer in 5 seconds. Another thing, be wary of pre-loaded anti-virus and spyware."
2,Still needs work,"I have to wonder if Vista will end up becoming the next Windows ME.I don't recommend this operating system for those who are not computer savvy. It's much more time consuming to navigate, requires a lot of troubleshooting, and does not play well with others (watch out when it comes to loading software, games and drivers). Many of the user interfaces have changed completely from previous Windows operating systems, so it can be difficult to troubleshoot the problems your are (at this point) guaranteed to come across.I do believe it has a promising future. However, if you aren't prepared to waste lots of time and energy messing around with it, you may want to hold off for awhile.Also, it uses up a ton of resources and runs slowly if you don't have all the latest and greatest hardware, which makes it in my opinion, a terrible choice for an upgrade. Your best bet is to purchase a new computer with it already loaded."
3,"For me, there isn't a clear beneficial advantage running this over XP Pro","This OS is very neat and tidy looking I guess. When I was using it, I had many small problems. I guess I would have had it still installed if my X-FI would work with SPDIF. The security and permissions on this OS is abysmal and annoying. I struggled to save a text file without running into a permission error. I think the sidebar is worthless. Many of the new features are worthless and bloated. In fact, I didn't need any of the new features vista provided. Windows XP does what you need it to do. For me, ""upgrading"" to vista was a pretty significant downgrade. But what do I know?"
1,The Latest MS Disappointment,"Gates and Company have done it again. This time bigger and badder than before... I have a wonderful pc with a fast dual core processor, 2 gigs of high speed ram, and it should just be zip zip zip, but instead it is by far the slowest machine I have. With all its patches my XP is the most capable, my 98SE is the fastest relatively modern machine, but my old DOS machine is still the best."
2,Not A Good Option,"I'm a lifelong Windows user running Vista Home Premium on an HP laptop, and have run into many compatibility problems with older programs I used on XP. Also, multiple small bugs in the control panel of Vista which require hours of troubleshooting and emailing HP, Windows, and various companies' tech support centers to control basic items such as battery usage and network setup. Seems like once I solve a compatibility issue it's back in a few days. I don't recommend upgrading to this until Microsoft releases a Service Pack 1- and since they've already announced they will only be providing gradual updates instead, I recommend getting a Mac."
1,"Bloated, broken and bilious","Worst OS I have ever seen in 25 years...Does not function even on factory installs, unbelievably slow, and NON user friendly.Wireless and wired connections will not start, will not retain settings, and disconnects randomly.If doing an upgrade, buy a new hard drive! Remove your old one, and set it on a shelf. If you have any problems with the install, you can put the old hard drive in, and continue working. Crashed intalls can wipe out EVERYTHING, and it can take WEEKS to get everything running.Requires up to 25 gigs of hard drive space..."
1,Vista is pure annoyance,"I bought a new computer and Windows Vista came with it. I have had nothing but problems with it. Windows Media Player for a month wouldn't play any videos at all on it. I had bought software that I used on Windows XP that always ran fine but on Windows Vista, it won't even install. Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 requires patches in order to run on Vista and even then has some issues with it. The Sql Server program that comes with Visual Studio requires a patch to run and even then won't install some elements. I get DLL errors when using the simpliest of programs like Notepad. I just had Vista decide to boot me off my computer so it could install a patch and then restart the computer. Half the programs I own literally will not run at all on Vista."
1,witness the mistake of the centry,its pretty easy to tell these posers just want to copy apple. i can't think of a worse virus to put on your computer than vista.
1,Please Please Do Not Buy This Horrible Horrible Product,"Call me naive, but I thought all the complaints on Vista were do to user error or people just not having the patience to learn a new system. Man-was I wrong. Vista is an absolute nightmare. I just got a new laptop, a Sony Vaio. The Vaio is beautiful, but I don't think I can keep it. There is a restocking fee for returning it, but I don't think I have any other choice. Nothing works properly on this system. From installing a basic printer, to getting Outlook to work (don't ask-a complete nightmare), to getting Plaxo to sync, to getting my MotoQ to sync. Nothing. I repeat, nothing works properly or without a headache.I cannot truly think of one good reason you would want to get Windows Vista. Stick with XP or look elsewhere."
1,I am so dissapointed and frustated by Vista,"I am usually pretty content with Microsoft products, but I find Vista frustrating to use. Moving 400MB of files will sometimes be quick and sometimes with no explanation take an hour (even with modern SATA drives). The network connection which worked fine with XP, now is unexplainably slow. There is a web site http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/ that does a pretty good test of your broadband connection. With another XP machine (and fairly similar in hardware terms) attached to the same router I can see a 6Mbps download speed. My other machine on the same router now upgraded to Vista, starts with a fast download, but is running about 56kbps by the end of the download.There are serious performance problems that Microsoft needs to fix before I would recommend this OS."
5,A clean install of Vista Home Premium is a joy.,"The DVD case is the hardest part, w/ the little white pin in it, it's a bear to figure out & open. But inside, then, there's the Vista DVD 4 u. To properly install & bring up Windows Vista Home Premium Full Version is a joy. To learn it & work through the pages & sections is a delight. Do know that it's miles above Ol' XP. This Full Version, which u can own & transfer when u want to any pc, & has Microsoft's blessings as well as support, is highly recommended."
1,This one's a dog!,"Don't even think about trying to upgrade an older computer to windows vista! It's slow enough on modern hardware, but on anything older than last years hardware, it's a dog. It's just too slow to do any real work on. Frustration will ensue, and you'll end up reloading XP, Trust me! Don't waste your time or money!"
4,"So far, Vista is great.","I bought this because Windows XP has had so many security patches that it takes longer and longer to reinstall the operating system with my old Windows XP disk.If you've been a long time Windows users, then it might take you a couple days for you to get used to the new lay out of windows. Also, I understand the need for the User Account Control (UAC), but when it pops up every 5 seconds, I ended up turning it off, against the will of Windows Vista.So far I've been very happy with Vista, the new slick look is amazing, and I haven't had a single compatibility problems with any of my older games/programs."
5,I Love It!,I'm a long time PC user and have always hated Windows. I bought a new Gateway Laptop 'M' series with Vista preinstalled. I absolutely love it. I prefer it over Mac (which I'm quite familiar with).It's designed for new computers with all the necessary power to run it. I wouldn't recomend upgrading an older computer (2 years plus) to Vista. But if you're buying a new machine then get Vista. It is noticably better then XP for home use.
3,"Is this ""new"" OS really necessary?","If you are a typical home user, this version and basic after careful investigation are really just service pack 3 for Windows XP @227 bucks. After most of the security features are stripped out from the business edition, consider what is left!! Five years of development for what should have been a service pack for home users, ugh.You still need an anti virus program and Defender for spyware is not highly rated. MS is still trying to catch FireFox with IE7. FireFox is what I use.Save your dollars and keep your Windows XP updated. This is not a needed purchase."
2,procrastinators rewarded,please wait to buy. this operating system has serious compatibility problems with many of the programs already running on computers. Microsoft rushed this to market. xp users should wait a year to buy.
2,It Stinks,My older programs that I liked won't work with it. My wireless connection keeps checking out unlike when using XP. There are a lot more reboots as opposed to my experience with XP. Seems Micro Soft ought to issue an apology for this mistake. Stick with XP if you can.
1,Terrible,"Bought a new DELL laptop forced to get VISTA or nothing. Hate it, hate it hate it. COnsidering returning the laptop..."
2,Don't Buy!!,"I bought this and it was a huge mistake!!ALOT and I mean ALOT of my programs that I bought in the past don't work and Alot of my hardware doesn't have updated drivers for Vista! I have a 1 year old HP printer that I can't use untill HP decides to put a driver update to download on their site! Vista uses way too much memory I have 1.5gb and and 2.08ghz AMD and XP worked alot faster! The little bells and whisles you get are not worth the money or aggravation you go through. So far I have called Microsoft 3 times on 3 diff issues and not one of them were solved on the phone. I have wasted 10 hours on the phone, and then ended up figuring it out on my own. Don't Buy..."
1,A huge step backwards,"Microsoft has really missed the mark and has taken a huge step backwards with this latest operating system. I have had a retail version of Windows Vista sitting on my desk, uninstalled, for almost 6 months now. Meanwhile, my computer is stilling running Windows XP and it's going to stay that way for some time to come! Windows Vista is slower, buggier and less productive than Windows XP regardless the hardware you use on it."
1,MS Vista Squirrely- First it works and then it doesn't,"My husband purchased a new computer with Vista, and it has been nothing but a problem. At first the printer, which we share, worked. We installed a D-Link, which came with his computer, and then he got a spooler error. The program's ""Help"" was worthless. We could not find any help on how to fix the problem on the MS web site although there were a plethora of freeby downloads on the Internet that addressed the problem. Ergo, we were not the only ones facing this situation.I will hold onto my XP as long as possible and wait for the patches to come out addressing this and other problems. This program carries on the Microsoft tradition of Mediocre Stuff, MS."
1,VISTA,"A bitter, eye-opening experience. Vista reqires more than 15 gig of harddrive space for the basic load. Many areas in the system were restricted as I discovered when I tried to see what was using so much drive space. A better choice would have been to stay with XP."
4,Not for a dad but for a grandpa,"We recently lost our ""papa"" so this was a bit hard. A great book for a grandpa who loves their child but not for us sadly. Great book otherwise!!"
2,Just another celebrity book,"My two stars go to the illustrator of this unfortunately trite, clumsy book. I have nothing in particular against Crystal's journeyman comedic skills, but I feel that this is yet another in a long line of mediocre or worse celebrity books that take shelf space away from talented creators with something special to contribute. I can't believe this book would exist without Crystal's name--at best the author would have been pressured more to fix the forced rhymes and jerky rhythm."
5,My daughters favorite book,"This is my 5 year olds favorite. This was not even a gift from her grandpa, but we picked it up because it looked so sweet. This is the book she used to ask for every night, and from listening as we read along, this is also her first book that she can read by herself. The page with the 'spaghetti kiss' is her very favorite. We picked a four leaf clover the other day, and she ran in to press it in her favorite book. Thank you Billy Crystal - we're looking forward to reading your next!"
3,Ok.,"Well made product. Easy to handle and keep clean. Specific to Crystal's personal desires for his grand baby, not mine."
4,I Already Know I Love You,I already have this book which I love and purchased this new copy for a gift. However for being a new book it came with no cover page.
4,Courtesy of Kids @ TeensReadToo.com,"In this short board book by award winning actor, author, and comedian Billy Crystal, a grandfather eagerly awaits the arrival of his granddaughter. Told in simple rhyme, we read along as grandpa anticipates meeting this new daughter of his daughter's.From the joy of that first moment of seeing a new grandbaby, to the excitement of teaching her to fish, fly a kite, tie her shoes, and taking her to see her first movie, the anticipation and love shine through bright and clear.This would be the perfect gift for any soon-to-be grandfather, or a book simply to be enjoyed by young children.Reviewed by: Jennifer Wardrip, aka ""The Genius"""
2,Control Issues,Bought this game based on the great reviews and initially liked it. Problems with the controls were so frustrating however that I gave up very quickly. I kept dying even when I was doing the right thing to solve the puzzle. One example: There was one section where you had to beat the gong with the ladle and then scoot up the vine to avoid detection from the natives. I'd beat on the gong and then try to click on the vine only to find it wouldn't work. By the time the vine was clickable the natives were there. Very frustrating!!
3,Maybe not for everyone,"My 5 year old received this for Christmas. We've only tried it a few times, because he gets pretty frustrated with it. It requires a lot of reading and he doesn't read very fast yet. He's pretty good at video games and I'm sure in time he will enjoy it. It's a really cute concept."
3,Too much hype,"Let me start by saying that i LOVE adventure games. This game was on my wishlist for months before i finally bought it. However, it's really not as fun as everyone makes it out to be.Every level so far is fairly small (a few locations) and you have to figure out how to get to the end. I must admit that some levels are challenging which was fun, but I just don't feel like it's that much fun.I would not have bought this game if I knew what it was."
3,Not a monkey island,"This game is a nice point n click adventure for the wii. Its ingenuitive in the different ways you use your wii remote. However the storyline is a bit bland and the main sidekick, Wiki is incredibly obnoxious. More of a rental than a buy."
5,Best point-and-click adventure game in a long time...,"This is the best point-and-click adventure game to come along in a long time. I'm an old school adventure gamer (Zork, King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, Monkey Island, Legend of Kyrandia, etc) and I love this game. I beg you to buy it so they'll continue to make these games!"
5,Fun Game,"Zack & Wiki is a fun, refreshing game. It is a massive puzzle game, with lots of different places to explore and lots of different items to collect. A very different game than most, but it is really fun. Get it today!"
5,Destined to be a classic,"Zack & Wiki Quest for Barbados Treasure is one of those games that from the surface looks fairly shallow and childish but underneath is an excellent game that will appeal to both casual and hard-core gamers. The game consists of piloting Zack (a wannabe Pirate) and Wiki (his golden flying mechanical monkey) through puzzles in different worlds. The learning curve is good, after the first mission you will be well on your way to figuring out the puzzles with ease...but not for long. The puzzles gradually become harder until they are wicked difficult.Underneath the cell shaded cartoon looks of this game is a deep logic-strategy game, I would recommend this game to anyone 8 years old and over. This game is a must-have if you are a fan of classic point-and-click adventures such as the old LucasArts adventures (Sam & Max, Full Throttle), or Sierra (Kings Quest, Space Quest)."
4,"fun, but frustrating controls at times","The game is entertaining and clever. I often find myself stuck in a level for a long time, giving in and searching for help online, and realizing that I would never have figured that out without help. It's definitely challenging. There's a lot of gameplay here... many, many hours. The humor and writing aren't terrible either.There are a couple aspects of this game that are particularly frustrating. The controls aren't amazing responsive, this becomes a big issue later in the game (especially swordfights) and in the musical mini-games (which sometimes seem to be offbeat to the music playing, but as a musician/percussionist, I'm never happy with the accuracy of music based games)."
2,Not For Mac OS10.5,"The VP24a does not work at all on the most recent Mac 10.5.7 release (Intel processor) regardless of what version of Skype software is being used. I contacted Keyspan CS (actually Tripplet) and they responded that they will pass the issue to the manufacturer of the product. The phone will function on Motorola machines running 10.4.11. It worked initially with my 10.5 system but only as a remote headset. After the first Mac update, the phone became very buggy and with the next update, it doesn't operate at all.It does function perfectly using Windows XP. So if you are a Windows user, I would give it a 4 star rating. It loses a star because it is so small it is very difficult to talk and hear without moving the phone up and down. Mac 10.4.11 rates a 3 star as it does work but without any of the Contact functions. 10.5 and above gets a 0 star since it just doesn't work."
3,Not the most reliable...,"All in all, I'm pretty happy with this phone. The sofware was easy to install and the phone itself is easy to use. It's a great treat to be able to walk around the house and not being chained to the computer. The only annoyance is that the phone is not very reliable. While the connection always seems to be perfect for me, my friends and family often complain they can't hear a thing I'm saying. As soon as I unhook the phone and use my headset again, the connection is crystal clear for both of us."
3,"Keyspan VOIP, GOOD value.","I purchased this phone to use with my skype service. The best feature is the fact that you don't have to be tied behind your computer with a headset. The coverage area is pretty good. A few drawbacks:1. When calling companies that prompt you to make selections using the keypad on your phone, I noticed that many companies don't recognize the touch tones. So I am left with using my cellphone to complete those calls.2. The menu on the screen is not very user friendly.3. Standby battery source depletes fairly quickly.Overall, get this phone if you want something affordable without being tide-down to your desk."
1,Does not work with Macs - period,"Do not purchase if you own a Mac. Regardless of what you read, it does not work properly. I've been through two of them."
4,"better than regular phone, but still needs improvement","Helped reduce international phone bills, and the voice is better, however - somewhat problematic to the average multi-tasker: it doesn't have a ear-set inlet/outlet, and is not comfortable to hold on the shoulder (when both hands are occupied.... e.g. for cooking, why? what did you think?!). Also, if the phone is ""hanging"" between ear and shoulder, the voice reception quality is tampered."
3,Mediocre VOIP phone - Keyspan VP-24A,"This phone works well in my small office space, but my reason for purchase was to be able to take it outside (like I can my other cordless phones). The cordless link is poor and I can't stray far from the USB transmitter. I'm looking for a better phone."
2,Buy a wifi phone,This phone works with your usb drive so your computer has to be on for the phone to work. Also for incoming calls it often didn't ring and when it did it was too quiet to hear even with the volume all the way up. Also you have to set you mic on your computer to the phone. SO if you use your computer for online video chats or what not you have to switch it back in order to do that. Kind of annoying. Over all an unreliable phone. I returned mine and bought a wifi skype phone which worked much better.
2,A disappointment,"It works but just barely. Poorly designed: hard to read the screen, no charging stand, batteries run down quickly, weak support from Keyspan. The range is decent though and it does run on Macs so it at least ranks 2 stars. But there's a LOT of room for improvement!"
1,Piece of junk,This 'phone' worked for less than 2 weeks. It now only acknowledges being hooked up to charge (on the display). Otherwise the display and all buttons are non-functional.
2,Worked OK but hard to read screen,I found it hard to see what the screen said.The voices were clear.But the feel of it was like it was a toy.It was easy to set up.I was dissapointed with it so I returned it.
1,Don't buy this if you want phone functionality,"If, like us, you have replaced a landline with Skype, you may be looking for a way to hear an incoming call around the house, so a mobile handset seems nice. Don't bother with this product. Its ring is just the Skype tone coming through the earpiece. So, unless you have your ear close to this device all the time, you won't hear incoming calls. And since the USB has to capture the computer's sound I/O you won't hear your computer either! We are returning ours...."
3,Emperor's Club,"I had to watch this movie for a class, and I found it rather boring. I had never heard of it until my assignment, and I can see why. I fell asleep half way through and had my boyfriend fill me in on the rest."
1,dvd,Very disappointed with the condition of this item. It was a gift. It stated it was in good condition. Case was gross. Not even sure if it plays. I gave it to my son anyways and explained where I got it. This is a good movie but I wasn't sure my son would think so and that's why I didn't purchase new. Wasn't worth the risk.
4,Lasting effects,"It is an interesting movie, because the questions it poses haunts you:can one really take the professor seriously? How important is it to always do the correct thing, no matter what?I personally feel that the professor has an exaggerated outlook on life, that life is after all a game too and therefore it has to be fun too. But there is no doubt that the characteristics displayed by the people that built Rome was of profound importance for the Roman empire and that to emulate such great achievements, men and women of outstanding character is required."
3,Admirable Effort,"Simply demonstrating that character is set but perhaps not molded, no matter how fortunate one's circumstances, or perhaps because of them, this straigth-forward, ""family"" film offers a pleasant, if not suspenseful insight into human character and growth. Kline gives a fine performance."
5,Excellent!!!,"Why don't they make more quality movies like ""The Emperor's Club""? A great family movie."
3,Reaches for greatness--and misses,"Finally, someone makes a movie like Dead Poet's Society! Well, no, not exactly. I'm a sucker for Kevin Kline, and it's hard to argue with his performance--or Emile Hirsch's--in this film. But the script screws the actors. This isn't a terrible movie--it's a pleasant enough way to pass a few hours--but the promise of the obvious comparisons to the Robin Williams hit makes it a disappointment. And just wait for the whammy that hits ten minutes from the end--a total repeat of the plot from the first half of the movie. The lesson, apparently, is that some folks never learn from their mistakes. Including Hollywood folk who tag good actors with a bad script..."
3,A heart warming movie about a teacher,A prep school teacher who teaches ancient Greek and Roman historyis told about and his failure with a son of a rich and powerful man.A long term lesion is taught...
2,"Lacking depth, mediocre & somewhat snobbish","I found this quite overrated. The script is quite thin, lacking depth, especially in character development. Most everything seems quite formulaic. Kline's performance is about the only thing not mediocre about this, but there really wasn't much for him to work with.It also seems stuffy & somewhat snobbish in old patrician BBC kind of way. A good piece of fluff for the upper-crust Republican nouveau aristocracy that owns America these days. They fantasize themselves as stewards of the state, making mankind noble while really just lining their pockets."
5,greatest ever,If you don't watch this you have missed the most wonderful movie ever. Really it is great and will pull at your heart
2,Life is what it looks like at first glance,"nice movie about corrupt politicians, whether they be Democrat, Republican or Green Party. A good case for term limits.Nice to see a movie about old school schools and about how well meaning teachers who want to give promising but failing students an extra boost at other, more deserving student's expense.If anyone learns a lesson in this movie, it is the teacher who learns that bad boys grow up to be bad men, and smart, forgiving boys grow up to be smart, forgiving men."
2,Horrible Movie,"If you view this movie within the world of Mr. Hundert (kevin klein) and and his view on life as a teacher, you should appreciate this movie more then i have. I instead gave it a perspective from judging the maturity and psychological development of all the characters throughout the storyline and as a result found it disgustingly random and inconseqential. The only real character in the movie was Mr. Hundert.The other figures in the story have a simplistic one-sided personality to augment the movies only apparant conflict of intergirty vs. corruption.Remember, if you ever do see it, concentrate on Kevin Klein, and no one else."
5,An incredible film!,"This movie is a masterwork that deals with a teacher's desire to instill in his students a flawless work ethic as well as morals and values. Mr. Hundert, a teacher at a prep boarding school, firmly believes (and rightly so) that it is a teacher's responsibility and obligation to teach students the Greek and Roman classics as well as the very first philosophical minds (Aristotle, Plato, etc) so that the students will grow up to be ethical and moral beings who can contribute to society. Mr. Hundert's belief is that it is a teacher's responsibility to not only teach students history, but also to foster a sense of utilitarian virtue within the hearts' and souls' of the youngsters. Mr. Hundert realizes that he is not only a teacher to these students but is also a quasi-father-figure who can mold the character of his students. I will spare you all of the plot twists in this great film, but suffice to say that this film is one of the greatest films that I have ever seen."
3,A Few More Choices For The Demihumans,"I have always liked the demihumans, as well as the Forgotten Realms Campaign. Although this book had quite a few new classes, there were few that I actually found useful. Yes, some of the Warrior and Rogue kits were pretty cool, some of these classes seem to be unable to use. Don't let this discourage you. You may find some interesting classes that would put the spin you want on your campaign."
4,good book,if you like playing as theifs this is a must need book.lots of fighter classes all so.also my favorite winged elf.
4,Valuable Tool For Moms,"I read A CHRISTIAN MOTHER'S SURVIVAL GUIDE by Iris Shamble. The subtitle of this book is ""Making A Living While Raising Your Family At Home,"" and Iris gives you plenty of resources and advice to do just that. She explains the various options available to us today: telecommuting, job-sharing, self-employment, and other work-at-home alternatives. She provides lots of URLs and tells us how to recognize the legitimate companies over the scammers--something she knows firsthand! Iris also includes support groups and their contact information.Chapter Eight is another much-appreciated aspect of this book. It contains a list of scriptural references to the emotions we all face at one time or another. I plan to keep it on my nightstand as a handy reference tool."
2,Not exactly as announced,"I own a large collection of Darth Vader items. I was excited about this product since it was a high-end collectible instead of a toy.There are however many flaws in it, which I will describe in detail:1)The product is marketed as being 17"" tall, but that is only if you measure it from the base to the tip of the raised lightsaber. The Vader figure alone is barely 7-8"" tall.2)The statue is said to be made of high grade resin. I could not find a single resin piece in the box. The base is plastic with screws, the figure is made of something similar to ABS plastic (hard plastic).3)The price was fair for a resin statue 17"" tall but not for a small, hard plastic figure. Think of it as a figure from the Unleashed line with a large base.I would recommend to stay away from it and invest instead on a real high-end collectible such as the ArtFX/Kotobukiya vinyl figures (do an Amazon search for kotobukiya). They are about the same price, 11"" tall and feature awesome sculpt and detail."
4,DARTH VADER STATUE,"Very cool looking and very big. For the price I got it for it was well worth it. Stands from base to the top of the lightsaber 17"". The base could've been a bit better maybe made out of something heavier than regular plastic Darth is resin and made really well. The detail is pretty sweet."
5,Love it!!,"Have owned several projection clocks in the past...this one has, by far, the biggest and clearest projection of them all."
5,The best clock I've ever owned!,"I used to have a problem with waking up to early and not wanting to get out of bed or search for my glasses, etc. I stumbled on this product 1-2 years ago and picked it up for myself, sort of as a joke, I figured the cats would jump up at or something, but now it sits behind my dresser and projects at the ceiling.I know at a glance what time it is and am not as tired as I used to be before I bought this. I wear glasses for distance and still find the numbers to be absolutely large enough to read during the night.I don't know the quality of the radio as I've never used it, but decided to buy one of these for my son.CONS: I'd really like a model that was JUST the projector. You have the set it separately from the actual base unit."
2,jWIN JL-707 Projection & LED Alarm Clock Radio,"Clock turned out to be too large for a bedside night-table, was analog tuning rather than digital and was affected (slow) by 50 cycles electrical supply. Projection feature was good, only other good thing was the price."
3,Meh..,"I bought it just for the LED projection but it is not all that.You can not see the time during the day...Also it doesn't have a regular alarm mode, only the radio function to wake you up..."
4,Projection clock,"Love this clock. A little difficult to set the projection time,but works great,If you sleep on your back position it to the ceiling, when you wake just openyour eyes and you can see the time. Works best when the room is dark."
4,nice clock,"I ordered this alarm clock, because I need projection. I like that the projection goes all the time, you can turn it off. It's clear on the wall. It has radio too. I'm happy with that, just it's too big like a brick."
5,Great clock for the right price $$,"[[ASIN:B00009W43F jWIN JL-707 Projection & LED Alarm Clock Radio (Giftbox)Excellent clock. The price is right!. I had one since 5 years ago and still working like brand new.CONS: I don't like to much shape-appearence but, you can't have all. I will buy it again."
4,Jwin projection alarm...,"My mother-in-law bought me one, and I thought 'This is the ugliest alarm clock I've ever seen', so I decided to use it until I found a more streamlined, attractive bedside clock... let me tell you, the first time you wake up in the middle of a cold night, and you simply focus your eyes on the ceiling... no leaving that warm spot in bed... and know what time it is, you will NEVER want another alarm clock. The projection is not too bright, and can be focused for those of us with less than perfect vision. The radio picks up well, too. Didn't give it 5 stars because it could be more attractive :) But did buy 4 more to give as gifts."
1,Projection Alarm Clock,"I wouldn't recommend this clock. I'm planning on returning mine. It's a lovely looking clock, but I have found it doesn't keep good time and it's electric, not battery operated. The projection part doesn't work well unless the room is totally dark and the projection is very small. Even though it was only $12.00, it's not worth it. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Disappointing at best,"This clock seems to not satisfy some basic requirements of a modern, functional alarm clock:1.) The only wakeup sound option is radio. There is no actual 'alarm' sound (buzz/beep/etc).2.) The projection display and the non-projection display are actually two different clocks. You must set them separately.3.) There is no battery backup.4.) The ""180* swiveling projection display"" does not flip when you swivel it, meaning that if you have it pointed one way, the numbers are right-side-up and if you have it pointed the other way, they're upside down.I plan to return this product ASAP."
2,backwards projection,Projector shows time backwards unless you face the clock face away from you. VERRRRRRY disappointed. Wife wanted it.
3,Easy To See The Tme At Night On Wall and Ceiling,"I bought this clock for my brother's birthday. The projection works great, however the AM/ FM button is a little messed up and you have to fuss with it to get it on FM."
5,JWIN JL-707 Projection & LED Alarm Clock Radio,"I read all the reviews on Amazon and I prefer to cut to the chase and say,""THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE"" The projection clock shines nice and large across the room to the opposite wall.The size of the display in 12 ft.is approximately 12in by 18 in..Large enough that we can see it without glasses on and in focus.It isn't to bright either so you won't be bothered by excess light.We love it. you can't go wrong.The radio is just fine for low volume listening to the news etc.it's typical inexpensive sounding radio.For under $20.00 this is a deal."
3,you get what you pay for,"Performs adequately. The Projection image is very faint, can only be seen in almost complete pitch darkness. Also, cannot rotate the image to have the clock pointed toward you and still have the image in the correct orientation. But, what do you expect for $10?"
3,Serves its purpose,"Only a couple of drawbacks to this alarm clock radio. 1) - If you set the ""sleep"" button to fall asleep listening to the radio, you CANNOT set the clock to wake to the buzzer. You can ONLY wake to the radio set to the volume you'd set for the ""sleep"" function the previous night. 2) - When tuning the analog radio dial for choosing a specific station, it's difficult to see where the marker is on the front of the radio. The projected time, however, on the ceiling is very clear and visible."
4,Clock Rocks,"The clock suits my purpose and does what I need it to do.good product, we now have one in all the bedrooms.jjs"
3,"Too bright, but otherwise fine","The projection clock is totally separate from the other, in that they both have to be programmed. The regular clock is far too bright for my liking."
1,very dissappointed,"The clock is one hour behind every 3 hours, which can not be called inaccurate, this is like a joke. The projection's clock is accurate. But as you can not see it in daylight, it doesn't help much. If you are thinking about buying this product, think again, don't let the low price fool you. It is not worth it."
3,Not fully functional,"What I like about this clock is that everything is simple and straightforward. Easy-to-read displays on both clock and projection. My only issue is that the snooze doesn't work, which makes the clock less than fully functional."
3,Reader.,"I liked this book for the vast amount of pictures that it had to offer. I was amazed to see the many different types of Mastiff's that there were. If you are trying to decide on the type that you are wanting, or if you want to know more on the different types, this would be the book for you. It comes with a brief history of each breed, along with discriptin of each. It doesn't go into great detail about health problems that Mastiff's have to deal with, so I would recommend that once you have decided to purchase a Mastiff of your own, that you buy a book also specifically for your type breed. This is my coffee table book. It comes out every time guest's are at my house."
4,Leaving something out,"This book is a must read for the person who is thinking of acquiring a mastiff breed for the first time! But, I must say, that I had already narrowed my choice down to the Dogue De Bordeaux, and the information on this breed was very sparce! I am most concerned about temperment, and how these dogs will get along within a family environment with other animals. The crux of the information dealt with health problems (which, of course, is important!), and the history of the dogue. It is very apparent that the author has had experience with the Bullmastiff and Neopolitan, as these breed descriptions are the most comprehensive. I wish that the breed bios had not been so biased! As information on the Dogue is almost nonexistant, I was hoping that this book would offer something more!"
4,Great book! Left out other Mastiff breeds. Needs updating,"This is a great book. I think that the way that the information is delivered is fantastic. A couple of dings however: 1) I didn't see any warnings against a feeding puppy food or anyother high protein diet. It might of been in the book, but I didn't catch it.2) Left out other mastiff breeds like Great Dane (Deutche (sp?) Dog), Newfoundland, Great Pyr, and Saint Bernard (Alpine Mastiff), Berenese (sp?) Mountain Dog and Great Swiss Mountain Dog & Dogo Argentino (sp?). Although many breeds are derived from the mastiffs, I believe that these are definitely dogs that are Mastiffs and should be described as such.Other than these minor beefs - a great book!"
1,no good at all!,"This product is very poor... It does not fit like the size chart says it does. I ordered a 2x normally i only wear a 1x but i thought i should get it a little bigger so i would have plenty of room.... well, the 2x was more like a small. Now, I have this jacket in my closet that i cannot send back and i dont need. Think twice before you order this one. I would just keep looking. The jacket is very thin plastic also."
2,Not the best for the money,"Washing dishes for a non-profit can be a dirty job, so I bought this item thinking it would keep me from going home each day wet from the neck down. This rain jacket did keep me dry, but it was so poorly made that within only two days, the stitching was pulling apart, I turned to do a job and the jacket ripped. I DID NOT pull the jacket, nor did I catch the jacket on something sharp, but the jacket ripped from bottom to just under the arm pit.I was very shocked that a small rip would then grow up the garment until the jacket was no longer wearable, even though duck tape had become the new color of the day!I only wore this jacket for about 3 weeks, and feel that the workmanship was not worth the cost.This item is made with too thin a plastic to be used for anything other then a ""light"" rainfall."
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed with this Lonely Planet. I think it tries to cover too much territory.It focuses almost exclusively on urban areas, with good information on major cities.However, interesting smaller towns, lakes, and recreation areas tend to be ignored.There are other guides available that have much more practical information in them."
2,"12"" pan","When this 12"" pan was received it had a dent on the bottom most likely due to very little shipping insulation. The pan also had no manufacturing sticker or label on it giving us no indication it was new. Most lilely not to purchase through this company again."
3,"Good intro, though a bit disorganized","If you know next to nothing about art theory, and in fact think that words like ""art"" and ""theory"" should seldom be in the same sentence, this is a good book for you. The author's approach is to discuss major aspects of art by focusing primarily on specific authors or works, and then secondarily weaving in short introductions to theories and theorists. I found it unfortunate that philosophical treatments are scarce compared to art criticism, but that's probably a reflection of the fact that I am a philosopher and have a preference for rigorous analysis over quasi-obscure essays. Of course by the end of the book you will still wonder whether a brillo box in a museum (or a dead shark, for that matter) really is art and why. But you will have been exposed to at the least the very basics of how to answer that question meaningfully and in an informed way. (My answer: no, in both the brillo and the dead shark cases.)"
3,Cynthia Freeland and A Very Short Introduction,"I am VERY glad to have seen the critical review that is posted stating that this book of Cynthia Freeland's is exactly the same (by all traditional accounts) as her book entitled 'But is it Art?' - The publication from Oxford of the Very Short Introductions, is such a strong support that I am surprised the book came out as a different title (and appalled really).Don't get me wrong, I used it as a text for seniors and along with more complex articles found it a very useful and well written text but this double publishing has me wary and I hope it is cleared up. I also noted a distinct similarity in ideas and concepts of one chapter to a chapter of Arthur Danto's from a book of his."
5,The best Bromberg ever,"I couldn't agree with Al more about Diamond Lil. It is my favorite DB song of all time. I saw him at(and actually designed the poster for)a concert at the University of Scranton in 1972. He was third billed to Peter Yarrow and headliner Don McLean, but Bromberg stole the show. It was a magical night that will not be forgotten. I love all Bromberg's work and the changes and growth in his music over time, but this album holds a very special place in my heart. Diamond Lil will break yours."
2,Awful!,This guy is a good guitarist and he writes nice songs but when he opens his mouth its like Kermit the Frog singing;not recommended!
4,Too Cute,This book was too cute. The ants discover a sugar source but instead of taking it back to the nest they decide to stay. After some ordeals they return to the nest wiser ants. The pictures are great in this one. The book is a lot of fun. I would recommend it for 2nd grade and below.
4,"""Two Bad Ants"" - One Good Read","Recommended by a friend, I bought this book to read to my granddaughter. Now that I have read it, I can't wait for her to come over so that I can read it to her!"
2,Disappointing,"I was VERY disappointed with this book. This is for beginners. The title claims the techniques are new and it's the 'next generation.' Okay, so it's a few years old--but everthing in it has been written about before this came out. Directions are not complete. Ornaments are 'cutesy.' Get the Weekend Crafter book if you want good projects to learn techniques."
1,Very disappointing book,I was eagerly waiting for this book to learn more techniques. 1/2 of the book is just explaining where polymer clay comes from and then jumps to projects that are not relative to what you just read. I don't recommended at all. Not even for beginners.
2,sorta new ways,"Well, I was disappointed with the items shown made of polymer clay. I wouldn't make any of them. It's too hokey, craftsy style for me. The first 29 pages gave me information re: the clay, tools, molds, powders and paints, conditioning times, colors, etc. . The pages 30-87 offered how to make a birdhouse, Santa's face, etc. Nothing I would do."
2,Outdated learning books,"I was disapointed with this book. The title is NEW ways with Polymer clay, but it was copy written in 1997. Very out dated. I think the boooksellers need to mention if these books are quite old."
2,Nice bra?,"I usually like glamorise. this one did not lift anything.Granted, there is quite a bit to lift, but it shoulddo a better job than that."
2,SABABA TOYS TALKING SIMPSON MAGIC 8 BALL,"Company originally sent a broken Magic 8 Ball manufactured by Mattel and put in a Sababa Toys box. I notified them. They then sent the requested item.. The ball had a button to press to hear ""Homer"" talk. It did not work, probably because it had been pressed so many times. The company claims to have a quality control department, but I doubt it or this problem would not have happened. I returned both products."
2,Talking Simpsons magic 8 Ball? HUH!!!,This Magic 8 Ball does not talk as described. Very misleading and for the price we got a ball and a simpsons uno game included. BIG DEAL!!!!
3,They never said it was Greatest Hits,"One gem, 2 very good songs, a few okay but mostly missing the mark, but production values soared from 1969 to 1971. Thank God they left us A Little Ray of Sunshine. Much loved Aussie classic!"
2,few real animals for something about animals,"Having been impressed with a VHS video we were given, I bought two more juana DVDs. They were all good.Finally, I thought to get the only one we didn't have, Conociendo A los Animales. It takes about 15 minutes before the kids even see a real live day-old chick, then later (briefly) two real goats.One of the extra tipitipi scenes shows some puppies.Caracas has quite a good zoo and Venezuela has plenty of wildlife, I was disappointed that this didn't show some more real animals. Maybe even a real iguana? A chiguire (capybara) or an anaconda?My son has seen two real jaguars in Melbourne Australia, Juana just shows him the same man dressed up in a costume as in other episodes. Even the adult hen is a puppet, also a cow and burro feature as people in costume.A gringo or Australian children's DVD about animals would certainly show a lot more real animals, I am sure.My least favourite juana DVD/video."
3,"Policy options good, other sections a bit biased","This is a good book that provides policy options to fix the energy problems we face. Some of the introduction and background on the various energy sources is biased. The author believes that natural gas should be brought to the future, nuclear stopped and renewable energy sources promoted. Not all of his reasons have supporting evidence and I have heard opposing arguments. The authors uses examples of different countries energy policy as his evidence to try and push certain things. There seems to be more examples than hard facts. Getting past this though the policy alternatives is why I read the book and provide good insight into our options."
5,Hilarious,"Funniest group of stand-ups I've ever seen.Usually with a comedic collective there's always a few comics that are mediocre,but every comic here was hysterically funny. Great material."
1,Lousy,This is a terrible book by a fund manager who managed to lose over 30% in kempers so called growth fund over a 3 year period. while most other funds at least kept pace with inflation. Look at symbol KGRAX for more info. Follow her lead and you too can lose your money.
3,It's Not Easy Being Bad,"It&#65533;s Not Easy Being Bad, by Cynthia Voigt is a novel about two girls that want to be more popular, but end up being less popular.As they deal with Middle School and the disadvantages of being un-popular, they come up with a plan of being more popular. Margalo and Mikey come up with a challenge-which one becomes popular first. However, since they also have a &#65533;bad&#65533; side to them. They cant&#65533; help getting in a few laughs. Even if that gets them more un-popular.They author wrote this book so anyone who reads it can connect with it. They get a view of what&#65533;s it like to go to Middle School and how hard it is to become popular.I wouldn&#65533;t recommend this book too much because once you start getting into the book, it get boring and you just feel like putting it down."
4,it is not easy being bad,"Well I really do like this book.It has 241pgs. I am not done yet but so far so good.As I was reading the first 10pgs. I was thinking it was really boring but I guess they want u to get to kno the characters be4 u get into the gppd part.Oh and it is really funny when Heather comes along but I will not mess it up 4 u all so read and post what u think!!!and by the way I am 11yrs of age and a book worm and if u ask me this book should be called ""it is not easy bring popular"" it would go with the book alt better but well I am only on pg.....153"
2,Didn't seem to work,"I have a cat with feline herpes and thought I would give this a shot since other meds and lysine treats only brought temporary relief. This product didn't seem to do anything for her congested nose and sneezing, so I won't be using it again."
3,Not necessary or helpful in my case,My cat was sneezing so I bought this item for her but it didn't seem to help. I used it for over a month after my vet's approval but since her sneezing continued and actually got worse we gave her antibiotics and she's good as new.
3,helped a little,"did not stop his runny nose but did help a litte and was faily cheap, ok product in my view."
2,not worth the money,Bought this for my son .. the tape is ok ... but not worth the money. The quality is good but still not worth the money.
3,Picture and sound worse than European releases,The picture and sound of this DVD are worse compared with the European release. On the other hand it's unfair to compare an NTSC release with a PAL version - anyway the difference is obvious since the masters are different and the master of the German Kinowelt release or the master of the British release (which is the same) is much better.
1,Altered soundtrack,I anxiously bought this release only to find that someone though the films would be better if new music was added to the soundtrack. The case says it has the original audio but it doesn't say that music has been added. Thank goodness I was able to exchnage this disc for something else. Why can't they leave things alone?
3,More Coming on DVD from Turner Classics,"Though I have these two releases, I've ordered the 21 disc British set. Next I'll buy a region-free PAL/NTSC player. In April Turner Classic Movies will release a 2 disc restored DVD of ""Bonnie Scotland"" and ""The Devil's Brother"", neither of which is included in the British set. That month these movies will be featured on the cable channel. So set those VCR's and digital recorders! In March TCM will also release a Busby Berkerly box set."
2,2 out of 5 isn't bad...isn't great either...,"I'm not going to bitch and moan about the picture quality like everyone else here, I'm just going to comment on the films themselves.I thought the first 2 films on the disc (Sons of the Desert & Busy Bodies) were pretty funny. The other 3, including the supposedly Oscar-worthy Music Box...just weren't very funny.I liked 2 out of 5, so that's what I'm rating it..."
5,nostalgic,this has to be one of the funniest movies i ever did see.movie box is a piano funny huh. well i just loved it somuch and as well as my family also. to funny for words.
1,do yourself a favor buy the uk release,"i rented this a few months back after hearing the neg. reviews.all i can say this is horrid.sons of the desert has fadeouts where there were none.obviously a tv print.the music box was recorded off tape you can see the tape creases.last week i received the l&h collection.all i can say is wow.all hal roach shorts and features.remastered uncut,original opening mgm logo.it cost me 140.00.it is a region 2 dvd,but if you get a phillis 642 dvd player about 70 bucks which plays all region dvds its fine.if you are atrue l&h fan yo have to order it."
2,Laurel and Hardy are funny...when you can watch them...,"The clips are great in this DVD, but unfortunately this DVD had some serious glitches - maybe a knock-off? Could not finish two clips because the 'freeze' screen thing happened. Had a couple disappointed kiddos on my hands."
3,"Laurel & Hardy (sons of the desert/tje ,isoc bpx/another fine mess/busy bodies/county hospital",Delivered on time. Just as I remember seeing them as a kid. Great picture quality and good sound. Couldn't ask for anything better. And at a reasonable price too. Would tell anyone who likes Laurel and Hardy to buy these DVD/s.
3,GET REGION 2!!!!!,"There's no need to rehash the problems associated with this Hallmark disc, I agree with all of them. I'm not waiting any more years for a decent L&H set(and probably end up with something as bad as the new Little Rascals set). I'm just going to go ahead and order the Region 2 set because that is apparantly the only way I'll get complete, unedited L&H films. It's just too bad they wasted disc space with colorized versions, but with good B&W versions it will be worth it. It's horrifying to even ""think"" about these colorized versions being on the disc."
2,Classic L&H Films Deserved Better Treatment,"What went wrong? The long-overdue, eagerly awaited ""Laurel & Hardy"" DVD should have been a lot better than the disappointing final product. ""Sons of the Desert"" looks a bit washed out compared to the Nostalgia Merchant video from the 1980s. Surely, Hallmark could have located a superior 35mm print - perhaps they didn't give a damn. Even worse, ""The Music Box"" has an unforgivable transfer glitch at the beginning that should have been fixed. By comparison, ""Busy Bodies,"" ""Another Fine Mess"" and ""County Hospital"" look pretty good, yet the latter short doesn't include the original Hal Roach opening credits! When considering the digital technology and archival material now available, one would expect these Stan and Ollie gems to match the excellent quality of the ""Our Gang"" restorations, but they do not come close. Hallmark should immediately recall this DVD and start again from scratch."
2,How Dare They?,"The prints on this DVD are, for the most part, the same old crappy prints we've been seeing for years on television & home video, even though Hallmark owns beautifully restored prints of most of Laurel and Hardy's best talkies. Guess they thought nobody would notice.Teach these bozos a lesson & buy the German DVDs!"
4,Slightly Dissenting Opinion,"O.K.,so this isn't the sharp,new restoration seen in Europe.But at least the prints of MUSIC BOX and COUNTY HOSPITAL have some of that crisp sunny look that one also associates with the best prints of silent comedies[especially in the Robert Youngson complilations.]I think the exteriors on HOSPITAL are brighter than they were on the 80's LAUREL AND HARDY SHOW package,and the greys are pretty good for a Film Classics print.BUSY BODIES is dark in comparison,but at least it's better than those contrasty 16MM prints that were once the norm.I think that the transfer of MUSIC BOX is the one prepared by Janus in 1978 for public TV,because I recall being struck by the clear sound quality[hiss notwithstanding]and this is duplicated on the DVD.I would love to find out why the Kirsch group restorations were not used.I know that Kirsch went bankrupt.Maybe Hallmark and Kinowelt are having some kind of feud."
4,Don Coyote,"This was an erudite, beautifully written, (even poetic), story that took me on a journey the ran the gamut of emotions. While I may not fully agree with the authors stance on all matters contained within, I can empathize with his perspective, but also learn from, and respect that perspective. His life story contained within the unfolding of his words gave me a ground-floor look not only into his life, and coyotes, but also the life of the people who lived, (and live) as ranchers and farmers. I related to his growing love of Don Coyote, and his angst at having to maintain essential boundaries for both their sakes. I was also left with much admiration towards the author for his respect for the incredibly important, delicate, natural balance of nature, and I can only hope that this respect, hard-won lesson, thoughts, and feelings, are highly contagious."
5,Sponge Bright 350,"I am so glad to see that I can order these through Amazon now. None of my local stores carry this sponge. It is wonderful. It cleans well and is easy to use with arthritic hands. They will turn brown if you get them in bleach, but they are just the best sponge for doing dishes out there as far as I'm concerned. I order them by the dozens when I find them."
4,Drop-in Replacement x Rim Strip,"Four-and-a-half stars because it was perfect except lacking a rim strip. The Wheel Master replaced a Sta-Tru wheel which had a broken axle and a half dozen broken and replaced spokes. Schrader valve. The rim strip from the old wheel was re-used on the new with help from scissors and duct tape. The freewheel remover, Shimano TL-FW30, removed the 6-sprocket freewheel, Shimano MF-TZ20, with the use of a 2' breaker bar, 24mm socket. In the description, UCP is universal chrome plating, i.e., not stainless steel spokes, and OLD is over locknut dimension, i.e., dropout width. The quick release that came taped to the Wheel Master is of good quality. A shipping guard is stuck in one axle end to keep the axle from penetrating the box. The tire is a Bontrager Race Lite Hard-Case, 27 x 1 1/4. For $34 delivered, the Wheel Master works for a Fuji Allegro, circa 1979."
1,Not worth the $ it's going for,"This book is completely useless and has no entertainment value whatsoever. Correction, every once in a while, when we're sitting in the office trying to decide what to do with the book, we open it for some piece of trite wisdom from actors, authors, scholars, and politicians. Of all the quotes, only the actors seem capable of putting together coherent thoughts. The rest spout off psuedo futurist predictions that aren't worth the time to understand. And for God's sake, DO NOT BUY this book for a friend unless you want them to have a hard time trying to return it for $. Frankly I'm dissapointed that I have to give this any stars at all."
1,Ebookman EBM-900 Franklin,I am not happy with this Ebookman. I bought it new and it was already obsolete. The mobipocket had V4.3 and to use it it required V4.8. I e-mailed customer service several times and followed their instructions but to no avail. I talked with Tech over the phone but they were still not able to get it running correctly. I wish I had never heard of Franklin Ebookman. All it was was one BIG headache.
2,This is a great band's weakest record,"I have all of the radiator's music. They have been one of my all time favorite groups for 15 years now. I have seen them live countless times, and I highly recomend that you all do so as well. As for their latest recording, it is poor. The song writing is weak. Don't write new songs just for the sake of releasing an album. I would rather see them release another live album with updated versions of their old standards, and more of the covers that they perform so well such as: Sympathy for the Devil, Born on the Bayou, Goin' Down the Road, Juke Joint Jump, Up on Cripple Creek, to name only a few. There are so many more that they have done over the years. The Radiators can be one of the hottest live acts on the road, but very little of their talent is revealed in their latest album."
2,Disappointing,"I love the cover art, but found the disc disappointing. Maybe, I've outgrown the Rads, I don't know. I used to go see them and loved them back in the ""Law of the Fish/Zigzagging"" era, but the songs here just seemed silly. Fortunately I paid less than a dollar for it, so no great loss. A previous recent review I wrote led me to purchase this CD as I wondered what they were up to recently.I'm sure they are still good live, but I wouldn't bother with this particular disc. The art would make a great T-shirt however, and I'm not sure why the Rads don't offer one."
4,A good comprehensive book - with reservations,"There is a problem with travel books in that they try to cover EVERYthing in a city. I like books that just tell me the best places to go for what I want.This book leans towards being a total reference, but offers the shopper plenty of options.The bargain shopper needs to know one thing - Century 21 next to the world trade center site. That is about where the unbelievable bargains end. Now you can save some money on the book and spend it on shoppingOne nicety about the book is that the author includes place to eat around the shopping."
5,This is not one of those plain old silicon skin,"I ordered this item together with my mp3. It arrived a week before my mp3. It fits perfectly. The armband it brings is nice too. This silicon skin has something different that other silicon skins... its not an ordinary silicon skin. IT HAS ""WAVES"". Yes...believe it or not. This ""waves"" bring a whole new meaning to silicon skins. It makes the MP3 look cooler, more confortable to hold and it protects more (at least thats what i think). (^.^)"
5,If you have fond memories of...,"...Saturday afternoon movies on your local UHF station, you should check this out.I get a feeling from watching this film that it's makers truly love the ""less respected"" genres of film, like sci-fi, horror, 70's explotation etc. They seamlessly blend all these different styles into one hilarious, fast paced story.They do make fun of their conventions a bit, but don't disrespect them. I'm not quite sure how they were able to figure out how to do all this, but they did.There are also some outstanding comic preformances by Chaz Truog as Polo McCrimmon and Rich Kronfeld (Wally Hotvedt of Comedy Central's ""Let's Bowl"") as conspiracy theorist Kurt Camp.By the way, for those of you who think the whole conspiracy thing has been overdone recently...you ain't seen nothin' yet. The conspiracy angle of the film is very, very funny.And I thought all indie films had to be boring and take place in coffee shops. Who-da thunk it?"
4,Fun kite to keep in the car,"I like this kite and it's easy to use and to store. However, I was very disappointed that it did not come with the nylon carry case as described. My main purpose for buying this kite was to have one to keep in the car.. so the case was a real selling feature. I had to buy another bag to keep it in."
2,Does NOT come with nylon case!,"Just received this; it does not come with the nylon carrying case that is mentioned THREE times by Amazon (Product Features, From the Manufacturer and Product Description). The case is not mentioned in the product description on the manufacturer's website (xkites.com) either, so don't expect a case with this."
2,You won't learn how to be a stand up comic reading this book,"While reading this book is mildly amusing, you will not learn how to construct a joke or bring out your funny side by reading it. In short you won't learn much about ""how to be a stand up comedian"". I was disappointed because I do think Belz is a funny guy. I just didn't think the book was very instructive."
2,Very disappointed,"I was disappointed at all the four letter words, vulgarity and the mention of one night stands while he is married. I felt it was also degrading to women. I love Richard Belzer as an actor but as a writer I was disappointed in the book. Does he want his two daughters to read his book?"
4,all of Mexico's surreality in one book,"I beg to differ with the online review who characterized this book as boring. The vast appeal of Mexico has been deftly assembled by the editors who have chosen a range of photos that captures the country's rural and urban spirit and its place in history and art. The quality of the reproductions is fine and the commentary in English and Spanish offers the opportunity to enjoy the book from the perspective of a visitor as well as a native. As a survey of photography of Mexico, it is far from comprehensive, but it offers a broad selection of images that leaves no doubt about why so many photographers, professional and amateur, travel there."
2,over-hyped and under edited,"Mexico offers a plethora of picture opportunites and photo essays, but this book does not bring out its potentials. A bad choice of picture selections by the editors obviously had something to do with how BORING this book really is. Save your money and goto Taco Bell for more Mexican enjoyment than this book will provide."
1,badly edited book,"the photos seemed a bit lacking, i believe it was the editors that had some problems picking the right ones. maybe they weren't real photographers or lacked training, or whatever, but i wouldn't reccomend this book unless you were REALLY desperate for some photos."
1,Really?,"You cannot teach yourself ANY language in twenty-four hours, or with only one book. I mean, do you know any 1-day old babies who are speaking the language of the family?"
3,"Excellent, comprehensive intro marred by lousy pictures","I'm so sorry to give this book only 3 stars, since it gives such a good introduction to ASL.Given that few people buy only ONE book on a subject, I will say Alpha Teach Yourself ASL is definitely worth buying for its background information and discussion of deaf history and culture.However, there is no way you can ""teach yourself"" signing using this book, as the photos are about tiny black and white thumbnails (about 2"" x 1"") that, if not outright blurry, are rendered indistinct by the printing process. It is SO hard to distinguish one minute hand gesture from another in this book!Since the ""teach yourself"" aspect is the book's stated purpose, I do feel I have to give only 3 stars. There are better guides to teaching yourself actual signs, but few that are quite as comprehensive for guiding you through the world of sign."
2,pictures not helpful,"a few words to share about this booka) i picked it up because it was one of the few books that didn't have idiot, dummy, moron or retard in it's titleb) it was an excellent book in regards of summarizing deaf culture, history, and edict when meeting people that are deafc) it was poor in regards of helping to learn sign language because the pictures were dark and hard to followd) I was confused because when i looked at other ASL books i noticed that some of the same words were translated much differently. There was no explanation why these words would have different signs.i would't recommend this book to anyone who really wants to lean how to sign... i think taking a program or submerging yourself with people that are deaf is the only way that will be helpful to learn the language"
3,pictures are difficult to understand,"Many of the pictures are dark and difficult to see. In may of the photos the hands are too small to see exactly what the fingers are doing.They are also not explained well. There are no arrows where there is movement, and poor written explanations of the movement. I misunderstood quite a few before checking them with video.Good explanations of the rules of the language and culture. This would be a good book if you already know the words."
3,Not the book to teach yourself,"This book gives a good Introduction on the history of ASL and the culture of the people. but the pictures are dark black and white, also small. So, I don't see any way this is a teach yourself book. I'm glad I checked it out at the library instead of buying it. I didn't feel confident that I was doing the signs correctly.If you want to learn by book I'd recommend A Basic Course in American sign language by Tom Humphries, or Barron's learning ASL the easy way by David A. Stewart Ed.D."
3,Fun to Use,"This is a fun addition to add percussive sounds to some of our handbell music. It seems a little high priced for what it is, and ours might be a little loose in the hinge, but unsure as I've never owned a slapstick before. But it's doing the job and certainly is loud :-)."
1,Sickening smelly waste of time and money!,"We have two other models from DeLonghi, which work quite well. However this one stinks! Literally.This unit gives off a toxic chemical smell. The smell was so strong we had to open a window to air it out, which of course lets the cold air in thus defeating the purpose of running the heater in the first place. The company said it was just the initial smell and that it would go away, so we ran it in the basement so as not to stink up the house. Even after weeks of leaving it running it still emits the noxious unsettling odor. All it did was run up our electric bill. We should have returned it right from the start!"
2,Don't Try This Album at Home,"Needless to say, His playing is nothing spectacular.His fusion experiment lyrically blew up in his face. This is an overratted album that I would not recommend to any JAZZ lover. On the left hand his ""Tales from the Hudson"" is a good modern era album. His flawless technique and great sidesmen keep the Album flowin'."
2,Bible,"I purchased this Bible on-line and I wish that I would have seen it in person before making the purchase. This Bible is printed in China as one other review noted. The quality is not the same as the older one that I had, that was the same version and also published by Foundations Publications. That Bible was ""Printed In The United Staes Of America"". The paper is not Bible paper and the binding is stiff, it will not last very long. The publisher may have saved money by manufacturing overseas but lost a customer due to quality concerns. This item is being sent back."
4,GOOD eXTRACT,"Works well in soups, stews and chili's and the like. Not the hottest stuff I have ever had, but it gets the job done. I use it frequently."
5,"Great price, great paper","Got a great deal on this paper, and the quality is just right for my design/drafting needs."
2,Possible Fire Hazard,"I gave the product two stars only because it actually did supply power to my electronic device. However, the adapter gets very VERY hot when in use and I could also smell an electrical-burn type smell. I am worried that with extended use it might actually catch on fire. If you do use it I'd recommend never leaving it unattended, and don't place it near curtains or similar items. It is also huge and heavy, so it will block all other outlets in it's vicinity. Not very useful for portable devices such as DVD players you'd carry with you. I don't recommend purchasing this item."
5,Great Game,"I've never played any Devil may cry games, but would love to after plaing this one. Fun game that presents a nice challenge. Also the ability to play as two characters was a nice change of pace. Dante is awesome."
3,good,"Nero is really boring, game with 20 stages, 1st 10 are with Nero, after that you play like 8 or 9 stages with Dante which is really fun to play. Story... isn't the best of it all, but well..."
3,The formula is aging,If you are familiar with the previous Devil May Cry games this will be nothing new to you. That is a part of the problem. On top of the lack of original that the franchise desperately needs this game also feels dated with fixed camera angles and long load times. If you haven't picked it up already I would tell to just the let this one pass since there are far better action games on the market right now.
3,"great game, lazy developers","Great gamegreat graphicsso so story, terrible romancea lot of backtrackinga lot of fighting bosses over and overfun conceptgreat soundgreat controlsworth about 20 bucks"
3,Improved but not much!,"I am a huge fan of DMC series, this chapter showed a improvement in graphics, animation, difficulty (less than DMC3 that was too hard, this one is really fun to play even in the most difficult level) and sound quality, but unfortunatelly did not improve much on game play, combos are really fun with grat animations but lacks on defence, strategy zero, killing enemies depends on how quick you push buttons, even the counter move is useless and difficult to timing, things that put ninja gaiden sigma and heavenly sword on top of my list of action games for PS3."
4,amazing,"even though it has been released more than 2 years, it is still one of the best act game for PS3."
3,Not very special,"I am a fan of the first and third Devil May Cry so I was looking forward to the this one especially after seeing gameplay and video trailers. After playing it though, I am kind of disappointed.You start the game playing as Nero, a character with a demon hand, chasing the infamous Dante, son of Sparda and main character of the first three Devil May Cry games, for about 13 stages and the rest you play as Dante. There are about 20 stages total.Well the stages where you play as Nero and Dante are the same stages. Basically, you travel up the map as Nero and come down the map as Dante. The bosses you played as Nero are the same bosses you play as Dante. It feels like you only have half a video game. Also, when playing as Dante the game feels way easier then playing as Nero. The last two stages you play through the same bosses a third time as Nero. The gameplay and graphics are decent and the story is ok, but I have no desire to replay this because of the repetitiveness."
4,Not what I expected,"It's a good game, not the best DMC like DMC 3. I was expecting more of a deeper combo list but it seems just short of DMC 3. This game did made me think of why they had to re-boot DMC maybe because they didn't know where they were going with this game. It's not really broken so why fix it. They could of made something special like DMC 3 if they wouldn't of re-booted the series. We will never know now. Would recommended to DMC fans but play it in normal or hard because they sure made this one way easier then DMC 3 and me personally I don't like that."
3,Fun but didn't break new ground,"Really didn't enjoy it as much as previous, the game play seemed so much the same I felt like I was playing another DMC title over again. The story was okay but not amazing enough to compensate for the lack of newness in the feel. If it is your first DMC I would say you'll like it as much as any other."
1,The game does NOT work,I couldnt use the game even once. It only charges up to 9% and then it stops. You should check the games before send them.
2,Ni me va; ni me viene,"No Me siento complacido con este articulo, para mi no fue una buena opcion, no la recomiendo , en lo personal no me agrado el juego ! es lento, aunque tiene momentos de accion, no llena las espectativas de quien conoce la coleccion anterior."
5,Excellent!!,Being a DMC fan i love this game!! Game Came Very Fast and in Excellent condition!!! Would Buy from Again!! =D A+
2,Too X-Treme man!,"This game it's not bad, I really tried to like it but it suffers the same fate as Poochie the Dog in the Simpsons... he was just too cool, to extreme... I mean XTREME!!!ONE for my taste, I know that action heroes are supposed to be higher than the standard but after I just saw the intro of Dante sitting in a chair and doing a flip while eating pizza, I thought it was borderline ridiculous (I bet he does a 720 while riding a skateboard when taking a piss).The game is not bad, but the style itself didn't quite ""click"", the difficulty level is decent though."
2,Frustrating game,"CONS: Camera angles horrible. Saving checkpoints horrible. Character flow movement horrible. There is no substance or character to this game. It's very dead. I gave up after playing for a few hours, not fun at all."
3,Pros/Cons,"Pros:- Beautiful, next gen graphics- Same old addictive combat system- Gorgeous cut scenes- Accessible difficulty- A few neat boss battlesCons:- Nothing really new in terms of gameplay- Short- Easy- Backtracking/Boss repeats"
3,Really Exciting at First... then boring... then they change the main character!,By the time I really got into the game they change the main character. All the combos you've spent hours and hours perfecting go away and you start playing as another character. It just annoyed me so much that I sold the game.
5,My son loved this game,"The shipping was super fast, the game was just what my 13 yr old son wanted. He got a few games for xmas so he is making his rounds with all of them. I will update more as I hear it from him"
3,video,bought for my son in law for christmas dont know how he likes it yet but was what he ask for so he will be happy with it
4,"It was fun, but a lil short for me",It was good and fun but i hope the 5th one will be better.... overall i enjoyed it. It was worth the price
4,"""DEVILS NEVER CRY'","Received the package on time as expected and i dont have any problem playing the game disc.this game is cool!visual/graphics well done.lovin my awesome moves and skills playing Nero's character!!!skill up system sucks tho:(missions are somewhat scattered,idk to me its confusing but thats what it makes it more interesting and challenging.trully challenging to the point i get frustrated from repeating and repeating when i fail lol.just sad that Dante isnt the main game character!but despite all that,i like it so much!;)"
3,Will Podmore's Political Agenda,Will Podmore's review concentrates more on the current situation with Iraq than a review of the book. Keep to the facts Willy.
5,LP281 Pros,"I tried these out with the band I play with and they are definitely loud. I play with an 18 piece big band and these came through on one of the latin tunes we play. I'm glad these sound louder than other maracas I have since the sound has to come through especially with a group that size. These baby's are well constructed and well balanced. They just take a little getting used to to arrive at the right sound and rhythm you want but, definitely worth it.If you're a percussionist, these are good to have."
4,Midwestern Chic,"Largely forgotten today, De Vries was a humorist supreme of Midwestern values. I HEAR AMERICA SWINGING is a clever look at how out of place Midwesterners can be in their attempt to be contemporary.Particularly hilarious is his tweaking of his Dutch Christian Reformed heritage with one scandel being a non literal uniform reading of the Bible. Admittedly very dated at points, De Vries still raises a belly laugh now and then."
3,A Bit Too Complex!,This was a very complex book. I found myself rereading things as it had lost me along the way. I found the discussion of chakras and energy medicine very informative but again it was to such a complex level. It also discusses the practice of using Medical Intuitive as a way to maintain wellness before the illness starts or is presence. I think the content in this book is excellent but the complex manner it is a book you must reread several times before you grasp the entire content.
2,I'm a spiritual person but...,"I'm a very spiritual person, so these kinds of books are my kind of thing. I'm the first to dispense with traditional science and biology when it's convenient, since they're very complicated, and they don't cater to the emotional and spiritual needs of the ordinarily-minded person. A book like this one should give those of us who choose to turn our backs on ""proper"" science something to focus on instead in our search for health, longevity and freedom from pain. However, if we're replacing all the discoveries and benefits of science, it should be with something MORE intuitive, something MORE spiritually simple, than what traditional science and medicine have to offer. Otherwise, where's the alternative? If spirituality has to be so complex, we may as well just accept what we're running from in the first place: empirically measurable knowledge. I give this book two stars since, at 320 pages long, it's unlikely I'll ever read it."
2,Anatomy of the Spirit:,"This book has such a promising beginning, with the most wonderful observation that ""Your biography becomes your biology"". A simple yet stunning summarisation of our cellular organism.For the most part there are many wonderful insights, but the text is often rambling, ambiguous and endlessly repetitious.The theory is very hard to understand, and there are many insignificant trite comments. Page 26 actually says that ""If you are spiritually centered and call back your energy from negative beliefs you can eat cat food and still stay healthy""! This is obviously incorrect and a nutritionists nightmare.One of the most interesting observations in the book is by another author, the neurobiologist Dr Candice Pert; who states that, ""your mind is in every cell of your body"". This kind of clear thinking and clarity would have been a welcome continuation of a book that has one of the most unresolved texts I have ever read."
3,Not enough understanding of profound damage,"There is much to commend this book. But as with many wise, insightful books of our time (Chopra, Majid Ali) it betrays an ignorance of the truely devastating nature of abuse -physical, psychological and sexual - on our deepest energies. It is quite impossible for the truely traumatised to apply Caroline Myss's principles, precisely because the trauma is so great that many stages of healing need to be passed through before this sort of ""letting go"" philosophy is applicable. Ms Myss writes superbly for the confused, the gloomy, the angry. But not for the most wretched, in pain among us. If your emotional baggage is modest, this book is good for you. If not, I would look elsewhere, although there is sorely little comfort to be found for us amongst the New Age/Enlightenment/Eastern movement. Whilst they make speak truths, they are indeed only partial truths."
1,"anecdoctal, boring, and harmful","I couldn't even get half-way through this stange blend of spirituality, mysticism, anatomy, and theology. I was most offended by the idea (supported only through stories) that people give themselves disease. I do not doubt the existence of the body-mind-spirit interactions, but she seems to neglect the fact that physical disease can just as easily cause emotional and spiritual distress."
5,greta learning,this is good information and easy to read easy to discuss good to use in a group to read and discuss
4,Anatomy of the Spirit by Caroline Myss,"I have read another book by the author. Her searching has brought her many incredible results.My beliefs are centered more with the Love, Mercy and Grace of God toward mankind.There is no congflict here, but it does.encourage thought toward some broader areas.I like the book. It is not a quick read."
5,The physical is only but a glimpse of a much bigger picture.,"Anatomy of the Spirit is the missing link between the physical plane and the higher levels. People have often wondered why people afflicted with the same physical health problems, where treated the same and the outcome was so different. Finally holistic care has come of age and it is books like this that show exactly where these connections are and how they can be addressed. A joyful thanks to Dr. Myss for showing us that addressing the non tangible part of our being we can heal the tangible or physical body"
5,Let the Healing Begin,"Simply a necessary treasure in understanding what ails us and how to face and release the pain, both emotionally and physically. Priceless, first rate! Heartily recommended!"
1,Another addition to the mystical rip-off genre,"I agree with a previous review - this book is full of hyped promises but does not deliver on what it supposedly sets out to do, namely, show the reader how to become intuitive. But surprise, surprise, the author follows up with one new self-help book after another, and the readers keep buying as they keep trying to find the hidden secret. I find these tactics to be dishonest and self-serving. Another talented person whose original desire to help mankind has been overcome with greed."
1,I just don't get it,"I became interested in Chakras after a trip to Santa Fe, NM. This was recommened to me by a massage therapist as a good starter into learning about chakras. I had to force myself to read half of this book. I don't care for the author's writing style. Very boring. Don't waste your money."
4,Anatomy of the Spirit,I enjoy reading books about this topic. This book is a little hard to read. It almost feels like it is so much information to comprehend. I find myself reading several pages a 2nd and 3rd time. It is my first Caroline Myss book and perhaps I am not use to her style of writing. I am enjoying the book and learning new things so it is an inspiring read.
5,Incredible!!!,This was one of the most complete versions of the subject I ever came across. This woman is most enlightening and one hell of a teacher!
5,Excellent book,Myss presents the seven Stages of healing clearly and from multiple beliefs and philosophies. Book helped to really clarify some of my misunderstanding.Would recommend highly for new and experience readers of healing and self help materials.
4,fascinating metaphysical work,THIS BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT ADDITION FOR ALL SERIOUS SPIRITUAL SEEKERS. A LOT OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTEMPORARY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TOO.ALL THE PRINCIPLES ARE CLEARLY EXPLAINED. GOES WITHOUT SAYING WOULD TOUCH ONLY THOSE FOLKS WHO READ THESE KIND OF BOOKS. A FASCINATING METAPHYSICAL WORK I ENJOYED READING
3,Thought provoking New Age philosophy....,"This well written and compelling book is one of the best I have read this year..It ties in a number of New Age related philosophies including the eastern Charkra and energy centres, speaks of the toxic effects of anger and resentment.. I read it three days but found it didnt answer all resulting questions.."
2,spirituality and energy control,"The author believes that there are parallels between the Hindu chakras, the Christian sacraments and the Kabbalah's Tree of Life, each stage representing a 'rite of passage' that must be honored in order to ascend with physical and spiritual health to the next. I found the parallels interesting and wonder if the similarities she perceives have their roots in mystic traditions that unfortunately gave way to the construction of organized religions. In any event, she made one statement that I suspect is the crux of spirituality. To paraphrase, ""We were put here on earth to learn to manage our energy"". Use this book as a springboard to others that address this issue more directly, like God Without Religion by Sankara Saranam."
4,The body is unrefined Spirit.,"Caroline Myss lucidly explains the direct connection between the dis-ease of the Soul and the disease of the physical body.. Her work continues the pioneering work undertaken by Dr. Maxwell Cade in his ""The Awakened Mind"" but puts it more succinctly for the present day reader. Another book I have recently come across which takes Myss and Cade's work further is the excellent ""The Autobiography..."" by Richard G. Patton, which takes the Spiritual point of view - looking DOWNwards as opposed to Myss' - which takes the physical point of view looking UPwards. I believe these authors are presenting two faces of the same coin. So, do you want to look up or down? The body is UNREFINED Spirit! Well deserved success with this book."
4,"Good, but Self-Contradicting","This is a great book if you want to get an understanding of the chakras and how they tie into the human condition. I am a bit amused, however, at the author's statement that we are too hung up on the realtionship between emotional pain and physical illness, because that's exactly what her books are about! Read this with an open mind. There are lots of valuable things here, but also many things which can be dismissed without loss."
4,Basically common sence eating guide,"In a nut shell this book tells you to eat a healthy diet high in fruits and veggies, nuts, low fat dairy. Exercise and get good sleep. Don't eat processed foods. If it grows in the earth like God planned then eat it."
5,Excellent Philosophy,If you follow the authors advice (It is posible!!!) you will definetely lose weight.
3,Dirt Monsters,"My son loves this series,too bad it is no longer made, which explains the outrageous price.Otherwise it is a good DVD and kids will enjoy it!"
3,I've seen better big machine videos,"This video is fairly entertaining. The real movie reviewers are my boys (ages 2,3 & 6). They will watch parts of this DVD but not be totally taken with it throughout the show. There are other big machine videos out there they like better (I Love Big Machines I & II and the Hard Hat Harry construction video). I'm not sure why this does not keep their attention as much as other videos but the quality of the camera work is not too bad and the voice overs are not irritating."
2,Poor quality,"My husband and I orderd this for our little train/construction equipmemt hound because we thougt it was so adorable. It is cute, but the quality is terrible! The sheets are very thin and rough. The fitted sheet is so small it won't stay on the mattress. The price on this was not terribly high by it was by no means inexpensive. We are very disappointed."
2,A little stiff,"I ordered this bedroom set because my son loves anything truck related! I wanted to get him interested in his new ""big boy"" toddler bed. It worked. He likes the trucks on the sheets and will point them out and name them. However the sheets are a little rough. The comforter itself is very cute but also rough and stiff. I'm hoping that if I keep washing it it will soften up. It's just one of those blankets that when you put it over someone it stays in the same shape until you bring it closer to you. At this point my son uses a different blanket when he goes to bed. One that is much softer and lays over him completely with out creating little air vents. I love the look of the set but was disapointed with the quality of it. Maybe it'll get better with washing."
3,Funny & entertaining with a spunky heroine to root for,"This was a fast & fun read with highly entertaining characters. Dutch wasn't a know-it-all P.I. but one whose flaws made her endearing. This ""not so tough cookie"" treasures her independence, but also seeks to make connections with loved ones. Don't expect the ""murder mystery"" to be complex -- the zany characters are what make this mystery fun. In fact, the most important mystery Dutch is trying to solve seems to be the lifelong mystery of herself, as she finally finds some concrete clues to her father's identity. Minor characters also change and grow by the end of novel. Don't expect deep social commentary or heart-wrenching drama -- but if you're looking for a light mystery where you can care about the characters, this is one!"
2,All over the map,"Too much goes on in this book. It would have been better at 200 pages sticking to the mystery of who killed the actress. Instead there's a lot of kind of sick and not believable stuff about Dutch (why is this her nickname?) and her boyfriend Michael. Meanwhile, she's flirting with Buddy. And then there's her mom. Too much. This book is unfocused and the main character's quirks are too weird. Skip it."
5,Hardcover books,I could not tell this book was used. It was in such wonderful condition and arrived very quickly. I love the pictures and the hardcover was an asset. It was difficult to find this book in the Houston area. I am glad I found it here.
3,Mike vs Tyson Doesn't Live Up To It's Subject or Title,"Mike vs Tyson Doesn't Live Up To It's Subject or TitleThis is just ok.It's not really a documentary - this is the London view of Mike Tyson's recent past. Most of the footage is shot in England.There is some info regarding his coming up and his past, but not a lot.The film falls far short of ""examining the man described as a monster by his critics and a hero by his fans""It's interesting and gratifying to see Mike walking around and shopping and being portrayed as a human being rather than a crazy, angry monster.If you're a Tyson fan then this is a nice addition to your collection of knowledge or materials (DVD collection)If you're not a fan you can skip this one."
4,Review for Hot Topics by Rita Mulcahy,"Same version is on CD - I did like to use this book while traveling with others and studying - it did help, but should be used with other training materials!"
1,Too broad and all over the place,"The answers on the back are really poor at answering the questions on the front; they just lead one to ask more questions. You never get the oh yeah, I knew that. If you've read and reviewed, ""The PMP Exam: How to Pass On Your First Try"" (I'd say 4-5 times) and taken a couple practice tests, you shouldn't need anything else. Especially not these note cards. Just one guys opinion. I did passed the first time with this strategy, but that's no guarantee."
2,CDs pretty much useless without book,"I bought the product and ordered the CDs. Not cheap. What I got were CDs of people speaking very fast - to me useless.I bought Euro-Speak and tried Magnum on Breton..both these have should have spent less time on unique user interfaces and more on content. They have interfaces that take over the whole screen and cannot be minimized and again, cutesy interfaces for learning - rather than efficient.I was praying for a product like Byki - if only they put out a Breton learner.Their learning interface is no nonsense and it was like a game that you could make as fast-paced as you wanted. The Romanian I studied stuck in my head.I am reluctant now to buy the book in that I might end up with a CD and Book that don't have good learning engineering.Folks like Rosetta have done what many others have failed to do. Unfortunately - they don't offer Breton either."
2,Virtually incomprehensible,"This book is extremely heavy on the esoteric, philosophical lingo. As a virtual environment systems designer, I found it to be essentially useless. My guess is that it would be of value only to academicians and others not directly involved in the technological aspects of VE and other digital domains. Although I suspect there might have been some useful stuff here, the writing is too tangled to unravel. If you speak academese, you might fare better than I did."
3,Huge punch...decent disk,"Listened to thru once and now for one more go around. First thing I noticed is that it was making a sound come out out of my 29hz Klipsch that no other BASS CD had caused. ( I need to look at a 20hz or lower ). Up to now my biggest punch CD was Musclehead Return of BASS. The warning on the front ""DANGER ultra low BASS"" is not to be taken lightly. Not my favorite BASS CD but if you want to give your speakers the ultimate test..this is a good place to start."
3,banaba leaf,"Nothing special to review with this product. I have not noticed any difference since using it, good or bad."
1,Didn't help lower my blood sugar,Banaba didn't help lower my blood sugar but cinnamon sure did. Get some cinnamon instead.
3,Good story ruined by BAD ANIMATION,"I agree with the 10 year old! This episode features mostly ponies from year 4 even though it came out a while after year 4. The princess ponies are all arguing about who should become queen. They each have a special power that they think should make them superior to the others. For example: Princess Tiffany can make a dull day a clear, happy day and Princess Sparkle can make flowers grow. Then, chaos occurs when Lavan, a lava demon, steals the ponies' wands. Lavan cannot control the wands and he ends up corrupting chaos in ponyland. On the quest to recover their wands, the princesses learn to be less selfish.Pros:Cute story with good moralFinally! a mlp episode with my favorite ponies in it!! (the princesses, in case you were wondering are one of my favorite kinds of ponies)Cons:Terrible animation (my little sister could do better than that and she's five!Cheesey Antagonist"
3,boy I hated the title character,"Ginger Rogers does a great job in playing a title character that you end up hating toward the end of the movie. I think the part with the inlaws were she has a fit because they have hired socal coach is were one really starts to not care about what happens. Thier trying to meet her half way, the thing to do is to have some give. Then she walks out of the marrage after give it a whole week, and does not tell the father of her child to be, that she is going to have his child. Wow !, how mature. Then she agrees to run off with the same man allowing so that he can dump his wife and 5 year old son. More like kitty selfish beyond words."
5,Kitty Foyle,"Ginger Rogers dazzled me with her simplistic character of Kitty Foyle. In a performance of a woman with no social status, but charms the hearts of two men, one of which may be too high in class for her, so his family feels. It is a movie that has you almost sure of who she loves, but totally surprises you in the end. Enjoy it, and I hope you love it as much as I did!"
2,The Mystery Goes On,"I had heard all the hype about this film and Ginger's Oscar, but after several viewings, I still find the film rather flat as an experience, and Ginger's Oscar is still a mystery. I guess it proves the adage about winning one ""For women, play plain or ugly (remember Charlize Theron) or play against type"""
1,"Well, it's ... different.","Keeping an open mind, I was prepared to read an objective work on modern day ""cults,"" which, oddly enough, include almost every world religion. What I found was a completely biased, mean-spirited jab at every belief system that didn't smack of hard-core Christianity. No one, but the most rabid Christian, could possibly find this book interesting, enlightening, or even entertaining. It is an insult that a Baptist minister chooses to wield immaturity and prideful judgement as a weapon against others. His uneducated ramblings are honestly not worth the time and labor used to print this book. Consider this ""work"" just another incarnation of Bible Belt Trash."
1,Sad commentary of a theorist,"Give this book an ""A"" for trying, but woefully lacking in wisdom. Early on, Christianity was considered a cult and unfortunately a generation stuck in the 80's still considers people outside the mainstream behemoth of religion in cults. It is true there are groups a person should avoid, but I question some of the groups included here. By juxtaposition to the harmful groups, those that are outside of the accepted mainstream appear heinous. It is good the Christian forefathers did not bend to the opinions of those that considered them cultists. I am also hopeful there are those that make up their own minds and that do not bend to the sanctioned thought of theorists."
1,Less than correct?,"I have a very good friend who is LDS with whom I discuss his religion often. He seemed a little concerned when I told him another friend had loaned me a copy of Kingdom of the Cults. I understand why. After reading the section on Mormonism in Mr. Martin's book, I asked my friend if he had any of the LDS books which were used as references by Mr. Martin. He lended me the ones he had, and after a few days of study, I discovered that many of the references did, in fact, NOT exsist. Those that did, appeared to have been quoted inacurately or had words transposed which changed the meaning of the original statement considerably. As a result, I would not consider this book a good source of factual information about Mormonism."
5,False teachers,"After seeing the news on the new wave in hollywood discovering scientology I needed to pass this book on. It covers Christian cults in America and abroad. Describing them as cults is not a degrading term, but merely the understanding they are a transformation of true biblical teachings. This book contains most of them. One should know the teachings of these religions. They can be quite destructive. Although not considered christian, Islam has been included because it does use parts of the christian bible. Of course with what's going on in the world with terrorism, one would be wise to understand Muslim teachings and the Koran, especially with it being the second largest religion"
5,Kingdom of the Cults,I purchased this book for a class I'm taking in theology and it has been very benefical in my studys. I highly reccomend this books for overviews of the different cult out there.
2,Cults Are Everything Outside Fundamentalist Christianity,"One of the defining characteristics of a cult is the mentality that says 'we are the singular guardians of Truth.' Too sadly, this publication practices those ugly attributes it attempts to expose.As a gnostic Christian, I think this book should be renamed ""Cults are Everyone and Everything Outside Fundamentalist Christianity."" While this book is informative about the history and evolution of some of the major world religions and sects, it is clearly written with foregone conclusions. The authors mentality of my knowledge of Christianity is right, so 'everyone else must be a cultist' is not consistent with the teachings of the Christ that he espouces to follow. Had the author done more homework on the political history and the evolution of Christianity, he might have been better prepared to render an objective dissertation on the syncretism of ALL religions."
2,Some Heresies Protected,"Martin ignores and gives a free pass to Roman Catholicism and Freemasonry. What a travesty not to call out Catholics out of that pagan religion with christian names that has a history of Massacres against true christians Read Will Durants ""Story Of Civilization,"" Dave Hunts ""A Women Rides The Beast,"" and ""History of Protestantism,"" by J.A. Wylie. Masonry is nothing but a Satanic organization but you wont know that until you reach the 30th degree or higher Read Albert Pikes ""Morals And Dogma."" and William Schoenbelen's ""Masonry Beyond The Light."" Martin and his predecessor Hank Hanagraff have ignored the most dangerous cults and spent so much time on blatantly ridiculuous cults such as Scientology , Bahai. What do you expect from someone who has a friend who is a Jesuit priest, Although Martin has already been judged by his works. (...)"
1,Misinformation and Out Dated!,The information in this book is way out of date and a lot of it is misinformation. He even uses questionable sources to support his statements when the source he quotes got the facts wrong.
1,Buddhism a CULT?! Please!,"By what definition is Buddhism a ""cult""? Excuse me! The Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, was born over 500 years before Jesus and laid the foundations of a highly rational, non-mystical approach to living before Christianity was ever dreamed of! The mere listing of Buddhism as a ""cult"" should be enough to dissuade any reader of even moderate intelligence from taking this book to heart."
1,Islam is a cult?,The author would have to be rather narrow-minded if he believed that a religion with 1.5 billion faithful (Islam) is a cult.Offending the 'infidel' will not gain any converts.
2,Shocked,"I cannot believe you would call Mormonism a cult.It is not, it is a true religion.I am mormon,and it is the true church..."
5,A Part Of My Christian Library For Many Years,"Being a Seventh-day Adventist, one might think it strange that I'd have anything to do with a book entitled ""Kingdom of the Cults"". And though I can't say I agree with many of his conclusions of Adventist doctrines, I can say that I enjoyed his indepth research. Did you know that this book is even sold in the Adventist Book Center(ABC) chain of stores? Not quite the ""brainwashed"" group some have labeled us. I also enjoyed listening to his popular radio program ""The Bible Answer Man"" throughout the 1980s before his untimely passing. And am glad to say he was a pioneer amongst non-Adventist apologists, to recognize the obvious fundamental Christian foundational beliefs of Seventh-day Adventism, that justify us not being classified as a ""cult"". One of his trademark quotes was ""we can agree to disagree, agreeably"". I always considered him a fellow believer, and brother in Christ."
5,interesting and informative.,Bought this book for a class at church and found it informative and interesting. Easy to read and will make a great addition to home library
5,Great Book,"This short review is intended for reviewers so adamant in bashing Dr. Martin's work on the basis that he is ""intolerant and lacks a 'compassionate' understanding of all other religions but his own"". Unfortunately, you have missed the mark. ""Your beliefs"" and ""Your interpretations"" are irrelevant. The bible subject matter is OBJECTIVE, not SUBJECTIVE. If truth can be interpreted in 10 different ways, then it's not truth.. There can only be one truth: the gospel as presented by Jesus Christ and the apostles. Jesus himself said, ""I am the way, the truth, and the light..."". Dr. Martin simply seeks to rebuke the cultist offshoots that dare call themselves ""Christian"" for adulterating the basic truth of the gospel."
1,"You , too, might be a cultist (if you're not a fundie) !","How are we supposed to tke a book seriously that lumps Islam (a major world religion that inculdes nearly 1/4 of the world's population) in with small fringe groups like the Moonies. It is simply a fact that the world ""cult"" is only appropriate when used to denote groups that are small, extremely authoritarian (i.e. centered around a strong leader with unchecked power over the members) and outside the maintream of any major tradition. A world religion is by definition not a cult. Niether is a well established liberal Protestant denomination like the Unitarian Church a cult. If any group that is not conservative Protestant is a cult (which seem to be Martin's basic premise), then why doesn't he call Judaism, Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy cults? It would be pretty ridiculous, but it wouldn't make this book any less logical."
1,Sick and Judgmental.,"As a Christian (and not one belonging to one of the many demoninations attacked in this book), I find Martin's writings offensive. To make a long story short; If you're not a fundamentalist, you're a cultist in this guy's opinion.Essentially, the book is a tome of judgment on religions that he has superficially researched and drawn inaccurate conclusions on. Any first semester religious studies student could see the swiss cheese sized holes in this man's 'logic'."
1,A misrepresented view,"The author presents this book as one of fact. He has created a definition of what he feels a cult is and applied it to those groups he doesn't agree with. Rather he creates a world that is run by the definitions of man rather than God. His foundation is not from the Bible, though his studies are well into it. Rather, his views stem from the Trinitarian doctrines, created at the Nicene Council, some time after the ending of the Book of Revelations. The doctrine is impure, it would be similar for us in our day the change the Constitution in a modern assembly and declare that the new version was the framers' intent. Sadly, by the accusations and declarations of the author, the early Christian church would have been a ""cult"" as well."
4,GOOD STUFF!,"I originally grabbed this book because I was looking into Christian apologetics. While some religions are not explained as indepth as others, this is an excellent source if one wants a brief overview of many religions and cults of the world. With any book, keep an open mind and continue to do your own searching and research."
5,Straight forward -unveil the cults,"This book is a direct opening message to anyone interesting in cults and religions. As an engineer, I found this book is well organized. The logic is correct. Strongly recommend!"
1,This Christian diatribe against other religions is a joke~!,"'Kingdom of the Cults' was written by a right wing Christian--talk about a cult--who knows nothing about many of the cults he writes about. Inf fact, he lumps many religions in with real cults and doesn't know much about them either. Skip this boring, tedious, unhelpful piece of drivel."
5,comprehensive,"This book explains alot in academic terms and I thoroughly enjoyed it.If you like this I would suggest a thought provoking companion piece the beautifully written memoir, Seductive Poison. It is the intensely personal story of a young woman caught in a cult. Truly unputdownable."
1,DO NOT USE FOR EDUCATION!!!,"This book was recommended to me for use in a curriculum on religion.I could not hope to improve on the other 1-star reviews, which capture well the reasons I should have avoided this for consideration as educational material.It is great for people who want cheer-leading for a conviction already held; not for people who want inquiry and critical thought about religion."
5,Moon Magic and Beyond,"This book is for anyone interested in the moon - the history, the phases, the meanings. No matter if you are using it for magickal purposes (for which it is phenomenal) or you're a gardner wanting to work your plantings according to the cycle of the moon, this is the book for you. It was recommended to me and I am so happy with my purchase. Beautiful graphics as well."
1,As evil as Liberation theology,"What happens when a man ignores his nagging freudian conscience? He packs up and starts his own little church. Talk about recreating God into the image of man! As an John Paul II Roman Catholic I can already see the gears of ""the new evangelization"" begining to turn in our new pope. AMEN!! A smaller purer RC church is just what the doctor ordered. Now if we could just get all of the other dissentors to rush off and start their own little ""mission"" churches! But of course when you can stand the heat...just make up your own church."
4,"Beautiful Eye Candy, And Great Acting too.","Very stylish, and easy to watch. Fairly good acting, and highly recommended to watch. For the type of movie, it was, I was glad that there was no nudity and not much profanity.Good Enough to see again.Tracey"
2,Lame heist movie,"There's nothing new here as ""Takers"" is just another heist movie with some decent action sequences, plenty of explosions for explosions sake and the usual car chases. Oh yeah, guns ablazin' in L.A. all the while. And if you think that Hayden Christensen and Paul Walker are bad actors, wait until you get rapper T.I! Idris Ilba and Matt Dillon add a touch of acting credibility to a pretty lame movie."
3,The Takers,"It was an okay movie, good thing i got it cheeper than renting it. I think they could have done better with the plot line. It just seemed to be lacking something. They had good actors in the movie, but it seems like they were handcuffed to make the ovie even better."
4,Action packed & ok,"I enjoyed this movie in spite of the nay-sayers. A good blend of action and entertaining enough to receive four stars. Chris & TI did a better job than many gave them credit for. Ealy, Elba, Walker & Dillon really kept it intense. Zoe's cameo fit well. Yes, there were a few scenes that had me saying 'that could have been done better', and could have pushed the rating stars lower, but over all, I truly enjoyed how the actors blended together to make this a keeper in my collection."
5,FANTASTIC!,"This movie is a great movie. While it's not the ""movie of the year"" by any stretch of the imagination, it does what it's supposed to do: ENTERTAIN. I rented this on the same night that I rented the Town, and I FAR preferred Takers. I would definitely recommend this movie if you're bored and have a few hours to kill."
2,Bad plot and too many characters.,I watched this movie last night on Pay for View. What a waste! There were too many characters. The plot could have been good but it was so choppy and hard to follow.
2,Ugh....,"The only true robbery is by anyone buying this movie. It had been a long time since I've seen an action movie with such a combination of bad acting, horrible directing, a snoozer for a script and a cast that couldn't deliver their lines with any sort of skills. Rappers, C-list movie stars and singers make up this woeful cast of 'professional' bank robbers who only 'take' the big ones... the major chase scenes are so ridiculous you will roll your eyes and shake your head as you watch them.... there was a host of reasons a sequel wasn't made."
4,"Off the chain, plus the actors are bad to look at either",This was recommended to me by my sister. I'm not sue how I missed this in the movie theaters but this is one the best ensemble of actors in a action movie since Ocean series. Well worth the watch with some unexpected twist in the plot.
2,THIS IS THE MOVIE !HEAT! FOR TEENAGERS,"This movie is big and flashy with no substance to it,Thats why i feel this movie is more geared toward teenagers not adults,Don't get me wrong the movie had pretty good heist & action scenes in it but that does not make up for the terrible acting in this film,Some of the acting is corny & down right laughable but still if your at home and have nothing to do grab your wife or your girlfriend and some popcorn and put this in the dvd player because i can think of far worst movies to spend two hours watching."
3,It was ok,"I'll admitt I got this movie because of Hayden Christensen i think he is hot. As for the movie had some pretty good action moments, but other then that nothing kept me hooked, also the gun shotting in the last scene a the airport WTF it looked so wrong. Takers is a movie I might rent a couple of times but not a movie I would want in my dvd collection."
3,just watch it once,"In my opinion cast is ok, though I really hated Ghost's personality - this actor is so obnoxious... Action is good, there are lots of cliché and stereotypes and you'd figure most of it on your own, but I was entertained.Overall I think this movie is worth a shot: it's watchable, action-packed and even has drama in it. If you don't want to buy DVD just rent it, and enjoy it once, that's what I did..."
3,"Fox TV""s new Def. for ""Cool""..","Remarkably misleading review by Fox TV ""cool as Oceans Eleven""..what's so cool about emptying so much of automatic weapons..!!when ""Skorzney"" led the operation ""Oak"" to free ""Mussolini"" that was cool..!..not a single shot fired!..when ""Daniel Ocean"" tracked the ""Night Fox"" that was cool..!Taken is a good movie nothing unusual other than a high-tech crew using the same vehicles each time they meet..good soundtrack & editing on the big shootout with the Russians..!"
2,Not worth it!!,"I rented this movie thinking it was going to be good! I was mistaken, it was pretty horrible!!!! I don't know how people paid to see this in the movie theater because it wasn't even worth renting for 3.99!!!"
1,Dreadful...Absolutely Dreadful!!,"I had my doubts about this movie when I saw who all was in it but I always liked Pawl Walker and went against my first gut reaction... I shouldn't have!The acting... lame and juvenile,(T.I. and Chris Brown, Please... these guys are not Actors!) the script... elementary... the whole movie was awful from start to finish. The camera shaking was way over done to create the illusion of high action and intensity. I took the fall for all for you so you don't have to waste your time with this one."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"Takers was a good movie. It revolves around a group of men that rob banks and other places once a year so that they wont get caught. One of their members (T.I.), however was caught and put in jail for 5 years and goes to the group for one last heist. Meanwhile, a cop and his partner (Matt Dillon and Jay Hernandez) try to catch the thieves. Now I can't ruin the movie for you guys but... well I can't ruin it. The reason this movie didn't get a 5 was because some of the actors could use some acting lessons and the tension between the characters at times felt way too fake. Besides that Takers was a solid movie with many twists and turns..."
5,I enjoyed it,I have to say that besides the delicious eye candy. I enjoyed the movie. It was action pack there were a couple of times when the plot was predictable but overall a good movie.
2,GREAT BEGINNING AND THEN NOTHING,"The movie starts out like a great action film as a group called ""The Takers"" pull off an elaborate heist of $2 million from a bank robbery. Meanwhile a cop, who does not use proper police protocol (imagine that in L.A.) is in an apartment building performing a bust. The Takers like fine drink, fine automobiles, fine cigars, and fine women. After the action scene the movie slows down. They exploded the helicopter too soon. Andy Sidaris says it has to be near the end. The cop was unlikable as we root for the bad guys. Unfortunately the movie never picks up to where it was as good as the opening heist. The story had nothing new to offer and I found myself getting bored with it."
4,Modern mob adventure,"This is really an underrated film about a group of criminals working in Los Angeles. The story involves strong loyalty among gang members, but also betrayal and greed by one of its members. Some of the scenes are raw and gripping, and the police are not always angels. Los Angeles comes alive as the focal point for this film, and it's engaging to consider the way criminals devise schemes to rob from the rich and then become emulators of the wealthy."
5,Great move!!!!,"I loved this movie when it came out, and BluRay just gives it another boost. I've seen better BluRays (this movie isn't the best 1080p movie), but it still looks great. Definitely a must buy!"
3,Not very original yet entertaining,"The storyline to Takers is not very original and reminded me of some previous similar movies like, 'Heat' or 'Set it Off"" from the 90's, yet it is entertaining and interesting. Never got lost or bored during the film and kept my attention well from beginning to end. The ending was so so I thought and could have maybe been a little better. Don't think I have seen a movie with Matt Dillon in it that I have not liked. Overall if you like crime/mystery type films should be worth one viewing.Peter J. Miller"
2,I LASTED 20 MINUTES,This was a confusing and mostly boring heist picture. I lasted about twenty minutes with it and didn't see it getting any more interesting so I tossed the DVD into the air and blew it away with my shotgun. WHEN WATCHED: mid April 2011; MY GRADE: C minus.
1,Really?,This should be used as an example of some of the worst acting in the history of film. Watching paint dry has more plot twists...
4,Good movie,"I saw this in theatres when it came out. I since then have purchased it for my kindle. I ofcourse really like the chase scene with chris brown. That is one heck of a chase. The part that i do not really care for though is the ending. It kinda leave you with an open ending to be honest. But overall the cast was a very good selection and the plot is fairly predictable but not extremely. Overall, a good movie. One I enjoy from time to time."
2,A vanity cops-and-robbers job that definately blows,"This over-produced heist movie is overloaded with subplots that play like cheap televison shows and commercial shoots for a cigar bar. There is an abundance of flashy editing to disguise a low budget and a videotaped appearance. It will work for those who like those pervasive, special-agent, cops-and-robbers shows that pervade the cable airwaves and require little or no actual attention. The hardest thing to take is yet another boom-box muzak score. The blu-ray is glossy and saturated with the look of a digital intermediate instead of a film transfer."
3,NOT A BAD FILM.,"I just saw TAKERS earlier today and I must say that it does deliver on the action. I would have loved to seen the actors have a little more time for character development as well as showcase their true acting chops. But, for action film, it's not bad. It does manage to keep your attention as well as keep you interested in the story. It's worth a view. I might get it when it's released on DVD."
3,"Modern Day ""Heat"" with just few cold spots!","I saw this movie and I was pleased to see Idris Elba stepping stylishly around as the Di Neroleader of the pact of Takers and Matt Dillion as the relentless cop. There where some questionable moments like Chris Brown being the first memeber of the gang to be exposed and chased by the police but who never calls ahead to warn the others after he slipped away from the police, why? Overall it was a good movie high on comradry that suffers from some chracter development that then tries to balance that out with action and the love of a brother for his problematic sister...does it pack as much heat as Heat, no but it does justify it self and it is a action thriller that is worth watching."
5,BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!,This is the best bass cd I have Ever heard it sounds really great on rockford fosgate subs I have six fifeteens and they rock.
5,Mr. Gordon is the definintive writer on the 19th Century.,"Jan Baker Gordon knows more about 19th Century Literature than the writers who penned their thoughts during that century. His wisdom, wit and writing charm compels the reader to read relentlessly to the end of the text. Reading Gordon on the 19th Century is a sensual feast for the mind...partake and enjoy!!!"
2,"Sorry, Alice","Well, 20 minutes into Malice, and my main impressions so far are the camera work is polished, and acting is good - although most of the characters speak English with an English accent that's hard to follow for Yanks, especially when sound volume drops off for no good reason.On with the show...50 minute update: Danny Dyer is an excellent actor, and this movie is best watched stoned.On with the show...End notes: The producers had an intriguing vision for a unique portrayal of Carroll's classic, but their script made that vision hazy, rather than clarifying it. Connections with the original Alice fable were forced or obscure, and some scenes were jarringly illogical even in a quasi-fantasy setting. Malice just didn't work for me."
4,Doesn't get enough love,"There are a few flaws with the film, but I wish I got to see it on a big screen. It bursts with light and color. Most people who don't like it, are comparing it to the kind of movie they thought it was trying to be, as opposed to the kind of movie it is. It captures the spirit of the Alice Books (not the Disney movie) in a nice way, and is fun to watch."
1,A Total Disappointment,"The DVD ""Malice in Wonderland"" was a complete bust. I found it to be very silly and I would not recommend it to anyone. Maggie Grace is a beautiful young woman but not an actress. The theme was very ""kiddie""."
5,Wonderful,"I really enjoyed this film. It takes a classic story, sticks it in a more modern time and makes it more realistic but it is still able to keep the mystery and allure of the original story. It is very well-made, the characters are likable and relatable. It's an easy movie to watch, no real thinking involved. I liked it very much."
5,Highly recommended,"I'm really enjoying this. The poetry selection is great, all by the big names in early 19th century English poetry. Michael Sheen (who played Tony Blair in ""The Queen"") proves to be a great reader. I don't know if he personally selected the poems, but he really seems to connect with them."
4,Nice looking magazine rack,"Overall, it's a nice looking magazine rack. It's not solid wood, as I expected - it's the type of wood you would expect to see on Target furniture. The metal hardware also broke for me (as it did in the other user's review) - but luckily I had another one on hand. Those parts just aren't very reliable. The price may be a bit high. But I was unable to find a style that I liked as much as this one. Overall, I am pleased with it and it is doing a good job holding all my magazines."
2,Magazine Rack,"Was very disappointed in this magazine rack. Liked the finish of it, but had a really hard timeputting this together. Finally got it together and two days later if feel apart. Why can't it justcome already put together because it is small and could ship easily."
1,AWFUL!!!,"Spent almost $50 for something not worth a nickel and especially not worth the time and headache. The seller is even worse than the awful product! This ""magazine rack"" literally fell apart after we finally got it put together and only put one magazine in it. Contacted the seller and they would not give refund and were only willing to accept returns for a replacement if we paid another $50 to ship it back to them and have another shipped to us. Not worth it! This went directly to the garbage and we filed a report with amazon. BAD BUSINESS SUCH A RIP-OFF! had to give one star because it won't let you rate it no stars"
5,A Modern Novel -Fast Paced and Fun,"The Cure for Gravity is a modern novel in the best sense. It moves quickly like modern life with a fast stepping story line filled with adventures, quirky characters- all of whom you'll like- And some way out sub-plots. You'll almost feel like you're riding a bike on the California coast on one page and sailing off Florida on the next. There's just enough tension drawn on the situations our heros are in as well as the anticipated resolving of story lines to keep the pages turning."
4,I liked it a lot,I would recommend this product to any fan of the Laker dynasty.Footage is great. Quality is as good as it gets.
5,Excellent Lakers Video,Excellent video on the history of the Lakers and the full playback of key playoff games is great.
5,It's All Good -- But Where's Kobe?,"Finally! The 2000-2001 Championship DVD was NEVER released on DVD (only on VHS) until now! You get all the recent 'back-to-back-to-back' championship dvds as well as the early years. The Showtime Dynasty was incredible. To relive those fabulous years by watching this DVD is so nostaligic. My only rant is -- where's Kobe? His picture is not ornamated anywhere on this DVD, yet there's a pic of DFish and Rick Fox. Is there some sort of conspiracy with Kobe not being mentioned on the DVD covers? And not mentioned as a Laker great? I sincerely hope Warner Bros and the Lakers organization have a good explaination for this. Kobe is a cornerstone of the current Lakers dynasty as much (and if not more) than Shaq."
5,A rare gem for Laker fans,"If you are a Lakers fan, then just get it - no brainer. The only way I would say not to get it is if you've seen basically all the games over the last 30 years, because one of the biggest features is watching full games from the 70's, 80's, and shaq/kobe years if you miss watching them. Oddly it does not include the famous game 7 western finals against portland in 2000, but that can be found on ESPN classic every now and then."
2,Not Complete,Well when i got the DVD i thought it would be the complete history of the Lakers even the years they didnt win the title. The DVD was just a compilation of the Lakers Championship Videos and had 9 of the games from championship years. The DVD was good but I was expecting more. If you want a complete history of the World Champion Lakers then I highley recomend it.PS: They should make a Dynasty Series DVD for the Celtics
3,Lakers suck,Good DVD except I would have included bonus footage like Laker fans quickly jumping ship and becoming Bulls fans after Magic retired than coming right back after Kobe and Shaq started to win.I would have also put Kurt Rambis getting clotheslined by Kevin McHale as the opening.Finally I would have put the delicious game 5 of the 2004 finals with the loser Lakers being embarassed. Closeup to the loser Lakers' faces followed by Shaq being traded to Miami.Other than that good DVD.P.S: Whether Boston or L.A is the better franchise is compelling until you remember Boston actually has real sports fans; you know the kind that don't leave 30 minutes early.
5,lakers are great.....but,the dvd is the usual stuff you see on espn classic but its great to have it all on one set ...but the lakers were the bridesmaids so many times it drove me nuts ..unprecidented? have not the dispicable celts won 16 titiles in 19 trys?
5,Greatest Franchise of All Time,"Guess we were a little premature in predicting a 15th championship for the Lakers this year. Oh well, it just makes this set an even more fitting collectible for all Laker fans out there. After all it might be a few years before we see them win another one, so it puts some closure to the dynasty for now. Til they win another one, we can always check out these DVD's and revisit happier times with the Lakers!P.S. All you Boston fans out there seem to be suffering from mass amnesia. Sure they have more championships but the Celtics havent been relevant for more than a decade! Are you guys pretending the last 18 years didnt happen? Since 1986 the Celtics have exactly ZERO championships. The championship drought is approaching 20 years and it doesnt look like its gonna end anytime soon."
2,Nothin' to brag about,"After the insanely hard DMC 1 & 3, this game kinda lacks, The game didn'tget interesting till you played as Dante! The story was dull, the action was dull and repetitive, the few boss fights they had were okay, and as said earlier the cool stuff doesn't come till you play as Dante: the boss powerups,the 5 fighting styles and the usual humor and action thatonly come with dante! If you are die hard DMC,buy the game, other than that, I would just rent it!"
3,Devil May Shrug,"I'm blasting through dmc4 right about now, liking the shadows and shining metal of N's sword and the overall presentation. DMC4 looks good and has lots of overdone dialogue and ridiculous characters all mashed together into some kind of story. Some may complain, but I love how N and D ham it up. B-video games at their bestest. Now to the mediocre: Controls are off at times; I don't like the shifting camera angles and how it confuses me when I slide around a corner; like too many 360 games (e.g. COD4) I feel as though playing an old game with a new coat of paint. Designers think that graphics are the only thing to change, but graphics are the easy thing. The challenge is designing something new from the ground up, as when Capcom did Resident Evil 4. It took them years to redesign the clunky old RE into something wonderful. DMC needs that same treatment; otherwise it's like looking at a sixty-year old supermodel. Not bad, but showing her age."
2,Bad All Over,"The graphics are great and the cutscenes are amazing to watch even if the dialog isn't very good. The gameplay is pretty dull and repetitive and those hidden levels are pretty tough to complete. The map needs serious work as its pretty easy to get disorientated. There is no replay value after beating it on Hard. No epic boss fights, either."
3,Ehhhhhh.........?,"This game all depends on your type of games. I'm not really into games with levels...... and the story in this game is slow to catch on. Not very decent. Honestly, I only own it because a friend lent it to me, never took it back, and said i could keep it.Not very good. 3 stars."
4,Great game... a little too easy,Fun game! The ballance of plot and action is perfect and the batteling system is very easy to follow. My only quarrel with this games is that it's too easy. I played the entire game on hard mode and only had to retry one level.
4,Great game,excelent service. Very good and great quality.I'm sure that will buy more games of this sender. I will hope DMC 5
3,Nothing to my interest,"The gameplay was really interesting, characters were awesome, but as a first-time DMC player I felt still like I didn't fully enjoy the game. Combinations, upgrading, buying skills. The player movement was very slow for me; wish it was a bit more unrealistic."

2,"NOT AS BAD AS SOME OTHER ""TWIN"" GUIDES BUT....","I still would not reccomend this book to anyone I know expecting twins.My boy/girl twins are now 16 weeks old, and I still feel this book is full of mixed information... I was very happy to read all of the information on the different types of twins but felt this may have been the bright spot in the book.After a COMPLETELY disatrous experience reading The Joy of Twins, I felt this was at least marginally better.I am still quite disapointed in this book when it comes to how it made me feel with regards to my personal choices of bottle feeding my children as well as going back to work.I am still searching for a realistic and honest book on the complications, elations, frustrations and pure joys of having twins....If this is what you too are looking for, don't bother spending your money here."
4,A great help,When you finally have time to sit down and read this book through it is full of great information on raising twins. But when you are a parent of twins you more often have time to skim the chapters that just pertain to you at this time and this book is great for that too. Almost everything that you could need to know is summed up in this great book.
3,As an expecting Mom of Twins...,"I have read this book since I am a first time mother expecting twins. I think the book is full of good information although I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over and over. It is the second book I have read about twins. I still haven't found a book that I absolutely love, but I have a few months until the twins come to find that book. Although it has good information, it just seems really repetitive to me."
4,A good twin book!,I only give this book 4 stars instead of 5 because it is the 1st book I have read about raising twins. But it is a pretty good book because it covers many important issues anyone expecting twins would be asking.
4,Great Buy,"This case is perfect for someone who doesn't want to lug around a heavy bag. I have two camera bags, this one fits my cannon rebel a couple of rolls of film and a battery. Its padded on the bottom so I feel my camera is safe. Very light weight. Excellent price."
2,Broken Strap,"I really liked this camera bag. It was a perfect size for my camera. However, The strap on the top of the lid has already broken off and only after using the bag a couple of times while on vacation."
3,small = cheap,I bought the bag because of its low price for my nikon d60 with 18-55mm lens. Although it is the smallest d slr on the market it did not fit in the case easily. There is no space for afew accesories also..
1,Do not buy.,"This is the worst suede care kit I have ever used. Horrible by any measure, Kiwi should be ashamed at putting out such a bad product."
1,"Looking for a good ""Quaderno Musicale""? Don't buy this one.","If you're looking for a good recording of Dallapiccola's ""Quaderno Musicale di Annalibera,"" keep looking -- this is not it. First, why not produce the CD with separate tracks for each piece? Having to fast forward through the suite's 11 movements to locate the beginning of each one is ridiculous. Second, this reading of the piece has little to offer in the way of interpretive finesse, or even accuracy. Tempi are all moderate, not respecting the composer's indications. Dynamics range from ""pretty loud"" to ""louder."" Rhythmic subtleties of the score disappear -- you don't hear what's printed in the score. Pedalling is cut and dried. This piece can be hauntingly beautiful when performed well, but you'd never guess it from this CD. What a disappointment."
1,"No good current ""Quaderno musicale"" recording on CD",Klein's performance of Dallapiccola's Quaderno musicale di Annalibera is as dead as Monty Python's parrot. Mariaclara Monetti's ASV recording is not much better; both pianists ignore the detailed dynamic indications. The Italian pianist Ruggero Ruocco's 1989 CD on ASdisc 5006 is very good but long out of print.
3,Not Really Carrier,"I'm a little miffed that what I got were not genuine Carrier air filters. I specifically ordered the Carrier brand because the are a trusted brand name, and their products are always high quality. I received generic knock-offs manufactured by a company called ""Accumulair"". The Carrier logo is nowhere to be found, either on the filters or the box. Guess I learned my lesson. You can't believe everything Amazon puts in their product descriptions. I rated them ""OK"" because they will probably work. I just don't like the deception."
5,This product works well and is robust.,Installation was a bit involved but worked the first time.I got this product because our new printer (HP D135 multifunction officejet) has a USB port.We now print from Windows 2000 orfrom Linux. Setting up Linux on my laptop was the most involved;downloaded the hpijs server software from the HP web siteand compiled it. Had to upgrade ghostscript to version 7.05as well as upgrade the kernel and futz with the printcap file.The printserver itself is robust to disconnections and powerrecyclings (of which there were many as we remodeled our home office).
1,Won't work with HP Photosmart,"Despite claim in specs, after an hour on the phone with (very competent, by the way) Linksys tech support, they determined it is NOT compatible with HP Photosmart 7350 inkjet printer (from Win 2000 or XP). They had it on an ""alert"" list, and wish they just would have told me up front. Unfortunately, I can't find any compatible USB printer server for Ethernet, except for one from HP that is as expensive as the printer itself! For now, can use an XP set up to share printing on the network (altho it is typical unstable Windows environment--often needs fixing, and the XP must always active of course)."
1,BEWARE - NOT COMPATIBLE WITH CANON F80,"Just purchased Canon MultiPASS F80 and attempted to connect to my network with the LINKSYS PPS1UW. Could not attach Canon F80 to LINKSYS Print Server. Contacted LINKSYS tech. support and the Rep. said it was not on the list of supported printers but, suggested we try to attach it anyway if I was willing to spend the time. After 90 minutes and I can't recall how many attempts the LINKSYS Rep. said ""return the print server - it just isn't compatible with your Canon printer."""
3,Works with kinks,"There are a number of posts indicating that this does not work. Just wanted to say that it worked on two of my printers. Epson 870 and Samsung 1710 laser. But it is not flawless getting it going. I seem to have a power on sequence problem. I used to turn the printer/server on at the same time. It won't initialize properly when its powered up at the same time. I've haven't figure the power on sequence but seems like the printer has to be powered on and initialized first. (But it may be the otherway around.) But when they are initialized properly, they work flawless if I don't loose power to the house. Now I leave them both on all the time. BTW, Epson's print monitor does not work with the print server.Another thing, DON'T loose the installation disk, you can't get a replacement driver from their web site."
1,"Works with virtually all USB, network-ready printers, NOT!","After several successful experiences with Linksys products, they finally stung me. This product is advertised as compatible with virtually all USB, network ready printers. Well, not so the HP 7350. It would be very helpful if a printer compatibility list were available. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Not Compatible with Canon MP730,"I like Linksys products, but trying to find a printer that works with this print sever is hard. I have to buy a second printer for this problem."
5,YUM!!!!,"The BEST raw, vegan, healthy, green lasagna I've ever eaten!!!! No meat, dairy or cooking!!!! YUM!!!!!! This is a really good book, full of fantastic recipes!"
2,Meh,"So this raw food recipe book is very attractive, super modern, really nice shots of the plated dishes but lacks content. The recipes are all composed of just a few ingredients, most of them truffles. Anyone could slice a raw vegetable, sprinkle it with salt, pepper and olive oil and a dash of truffles and call it a dish. I was hoping for meals, not amuse bouche for five stars restaurants."
2,Mixed feelings,"Few recipes are very good, but almost all of them are way too complicated, labor intensive and with too many hard to find and expensive ingredients and it's based on bad science."
4,"Gorgeous, inspirational, but complicated","If you're the kind of person who has to follow a recipe exactly, this may not be the book for you as a lot of the ingredients are hard to find & recipes are a bit complicated. However, if you love fancy, interesting restaurants & are willing to put in the effort to recreate some of their dishes, this does have some amazing recipes. Personally, I have been trying the raw food diet for the past few months (around 50% raw) & was looking for some ideas to inspire me to eat more raw foods & make them more appetizing. This book definitely delivers--the photos are gorgeous & although I couldn't follow the recipes exactly, at least it gave me lots of ideas of things to try. I borrowed this book from the library, but will definitely purchase for when I need some inspiration."
5,Great!,"My husband is a chef and loves Charlie Trotter, I've bought him every book by Trotter. He often looks at them for inspiration."
3,Overboard for the average Joe.,"If you are an aspiring raw food chef or a serious foodie who really enjoys spending lots of time preparing food; then maybe this book will work for you. For the rest of us, it is interesting reading, creative; BUT the recipes are a long way from practical, simple or basic. Some of the ingredients are not easily attainable (even if you have ever heard of them). And the recipes are often so complicated and have so many ingredients you are overwhelmed before you make it to the market. This is not your everyday raw food resource. This is for the strong willed, patient and devoted. Although I am sure most of the recipes are great, this book essentially became a coffee table book that spurs interesting conversation in my home on the subject of raw food. It has great pictures, a simple yet chic name, and a great chef."
3,"Raw, because you are better than those who eat cooked...","The book contains many great pictures of very excellent looking food. The pictures are definitely the best part of it.The text is too preachy, excessively extolling the virtues of raw food and those who consume it. Because of the ""We are better than them attitude"" this book is not as informative as it would been.Many of the suggested ingredients for the recipes are not readily available in most markets, and many of the recipes are WAY too time consuming to be practical."
5,Brilliant book!,"When I first saw this book, I was slightly intimidated by some of the recipes - they seemed to have so many ingredients and different stages. I have since however prepared several of the dishes and the tastes are sublime and make the recipes well worth the effort! This is an excellent book and as about 70% of the food I eat is raw anyway, it gave me a huge number of new ideas for preparation and presentation."
2,complex recipes,If your looking for gourmet raw food preperation that takes multiple days and multiple steps to make 1 food dish than this book is for you. I found the recipes to be more work than the food was worth. I imagine the recipes would be fine for a gourmet person who spends a lot of time making raw food look good.
3,Raw,"This a very lovely book to look at or sit on your coffee table. If one has alot of time for food preparation containing alot of ingredients, this book is for you. If you are like me, very busy, work and have limited time, you may find this book only used for special occasions when you have alot of time alloted to prepare a meal. The photography is absolutely gorgeous, and it again is very pretty to look at, but most of the recipes are very labor intensive."
2,"Well, it does have a big display",Great if you have issues seeing your clock. Radio reception terrible. Switches feel cheap. Keeps accurate time...
4,Great television,"This is the biggest, best television I've ever owned, and I'm no connoisseur of televisions either. The picture is clear, the options plenty, with lots of input and output jacks in the back of the television so you can hook up your DVD, cable, computer, and a few other things.My only complaint at this point would be that the stereo audio hook-ups only work with an HDTV input, and, since our cable hook-up is not HDTV, we only get to use the two television speakers when watching cable - although we do have surround sound when watching DVDs.Overall, it's an excellent television and I HIGHLY recommend it. We got it at a price lower than on Amazon, but I'd still consider it worth the list price on this site."
4,Heed the warning,"This is a decent Bass CD for testing out your new car audio system. There is a warning on the disc that it has ultra-low bass and can damage speakers. It can, and it will. Don't play it on cheap speakers or they will break. Not too bad overall if you want some thumping."
3,Classic Bass Album for a Bass Collector and Enthusiast.,I bought this album on cassette years ago. Good production. This is an album that is worthy of your bass music collection.
5,CF Card case,Nice Aluminum case with rubber inserts to hold card. I am a bit warry of the flexible plastic hinge.
2,Broke After Two Months,I bought this case and it is cool. It would be cooler if the metal wasn't painted. The color is something between green and gray. Brushed aluminum would have been better (in my opinion).I'm rating it low because the plastic clip that opens the case broke after about two months. It might have just been a fluke but I took DAMN good care of it and it broke anyway.Cool will only get you so far...
3,"Nice, but...","This is a nice case that is reasonably well-designed. The shape and size is nice; the cards are held well; the latch works easily and securely. However, the hinge is a flexing piece of plastic. I worry about the long-term reliability of that. The rest of the case will outlast the hinge, for sure. I'd pay another dollar or two for a real hinge."
3,Carefull of this one,"It does look ""slick"" like one of the other reviews said, but I had mine 2 days and the one aluminium cover came off. Turns out the sides are stuck onto the plastica casing with double-sided tape... eeck.Put some super-glue in the mix and it was fixed!! HahaNow it looks slick again and does what I bought it for.Now I just wonder how long the plastice hinge will last."
3,FELL SHORT,"I am a fan of the Breed books but this one fell short. There were too many sex scenes to fit a real plot in the book. The sex scenes were long drawn out to the point I would read a few pages and then oh look, more sex...........skim skim skim, back to the story, read a few more pages, oh look more of the same sex....really? After a while, what should have been steamy scenes grew tepid at best and didn't help the story.The saving grace was the plot twist at the end. Over all the book left me feeling it was a waste of reading time for the most part."
5,READER FROM NEW YORK CITY.,"JACOB'S FAITHTHEY WERE A NEW BREED ENGINEERED RATHER THAN BORN. THROWN TOGETHER BY THE EVIL PEOPLE THAT CREATED THEM.SHE HAS LOVED HIM FROM AFAR, HE HAS FOUGHT BEING WITH HER. NOW, THEY ARE ONCE THROWN TOGETHER WITH A SEXUAL HEAT THAT IS INTENSIFYING AND ALL CONSUMING. JACOB AND FAITH NOW MUST FIGHT THE VERY PEOPLE THAT HAVE CREATED THEM, FOR A CHANCE AT HAPPINESS.LORA IS ONE OF THE BEST AUTHORS I HAVE KNOWN. HER STORIES ARE COMBINATION OF ACTION, EROTICA, AND SUSPENSE. ONCE AGAIN SHE COMES TRHOUGH WITH JACOBS FAITH. FIVE STARS, IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU YOU WOULD WANT IN AN EROTICA."
5,Not the book to start with.,"Ok...this review is for those of you who have stumbled into this wonderful series and are thinking of starting with this book. This is NOT the book you want to read, to ""break into"" this series. While some of the books can be read out of order you will get MUCH more enjoyment starting with book one of the ""breed"" series. A friend lent me this book so I started here. This book was confusing out of order with the rest of the series, so after I read it the first time, I went back and started at the beginning. Wow. Great series! Get this book and read it...but do yourself a favor and start at the beginning...you will be very glad you discovered another author to add to your list of keepers."
3,The other books have were better but give it a try...,First I have to say that I am a huge fan of the Breed series and Lora is one of my fav authors but this one wasn't my favorite though it was a good read.The book just didn't have that depth like the other books although I did enjoy the dialoged when Faith was talking about her BOBs.The end of the book brought in the character Aiden and how his mate is being held by the Council to force the mating heat. That book sounds like it will have more conflict and depth but all in all Jacob's Faith wasn't that bad
1,"Abusive loser ""hero"" regardless of species.","This is a story about a race of genetically altered soldiers and their fight against the council that created them. Sounds good! The idea, in fact, is pretty neat. Ms. Leigh creates a wonderful world for us, but fills it with a mean and emotionally abusive hero.Faith is Jacob's mate. Because of their genetic programming she is in both physical and emotional agony since he rejected her.Why did he reject her? He rejected her because he felt that their first sexual encounter, when she is under the influence of an aphrodisiac, was too close to rape. Was it rape? Not really (but, she does say she doesn't want it like this). Does she blame him for this? Not at all.So, he then leaves her (literally on another continent) to suffer because of what he thinks he did wrong...Oh and he treats her pretty badly throughout the book. Does this make sense? Not to me. The ""hero"" is, in my opinion, a jerk."
1,Gross.,"I purchased this book and Elizabeth's Wolf at the same time. If I would have known that they were both about women having sex with men who have dog penises, I would never had bought them. This has to be the most revolting erotica I have ever read. In the stories, the man's penis ejaculates several times over during the beginning of intercourse (like an animal) and then knots inside the female, like a dog. Need I say more?"
1,Way over-rated,I did not care for this book at all. The plotline (as clearly stated by several reviewers here) is not remotely feasible. I could also anticipate basically everything that was going to happen. The characters feel very flat. I don't know them at all.I cannot recommend it.
2,Ok I guess,I had a little trouble getting into this one. I'm a fan of all Leigh's breed books but this one didnt seem to have to much of a plot. I felt like I was reading a porn which is ok to a point. Toward the end I found myself skipping over scenes because it was just to much.
2,My least favorite from the series,"This one, for some reason, didn't hold my interest. I was skimming through it near the end. Once Jacob and Faith were reuinted, they stayed in one location for the rest of the book, and I think this is why there couldn't be any real plot development. They just stayed locked in a house the whole time arguing about the same things over and over. And the book was poorly edited. There are a couple of passages that repeat literally word for word. (There are 2 seperate instances where the house alarms go off while Jacob and Faith are sleeping, and each time, they get dressed while having word-for-word the exact same conversation.) This one would have been better as a short instead of a full length novel."
3,Missing something,"Can't say I loved this book, not up to this author's usual standards. Tried too hard with the emotional storyline that just fell short. The hot language that I usally enjoy left me cold as it seem out of place. I just did not enjoy this, if fact, I put in down several times. That has never happened with a Lora Leigh breed series book."
2,Very Dry Read for A Breed Book,I am a fan of Lora Leigh's Breed books but this one did not get off the ground for me. I had a difficult time finishing it and finally just skimmed about the latter third of it. I really was not invested in either of the main characters. Very disappointed.
2,Fair UI -- Poor Physical Design,"A double timer is a great idea, but this device turned out to not be a winner in practice. Clearing the timer and getting back to a clock display always seems to take one button press more than should be needed. The killer is that all of these button presses are around the EDGE of the timer, whereas the magnet/stand that should allow you to use it one-handed is in the MIDDLE of the back, providing no support for pressing those buttons. The second time I used it, pressing a timer button made it tilt against the front of the fridge, disconnecting the magnet, and dropping it six feet to the floor. Stupidly, I had already shredded the receipt, so I'm sure the karma was my fault anyway."
2,poor product,"Buttons stick (after only 2 months, need to use your nails to get them out and working), complicated secuence to reset (and I'm pretty good with machines..this is NOT intuitive at all! You have to push stop, timer, stop, reset, reset AGAIN and clook to stop it!!!), cheaped made.If you can overlook these flaws is OK and has nice features (nice sound, 5 minutes warning, recall and off course, double timer)"
1,Taylor Dual Timer,The first timer sent ws defective. Buttons T1 & T2 did not work. The second timer in replacement was also defective and was sent back. You were supposed to have credited my account. I'm not happy the way this was handled. Are these timers used? and is there any quality control?
3,well except one thing,the only problem is if you attach the unit on the fridge you have to hold the unit by pressing any button on it..
1,Too small to fit its value,"Shipped in a small envelope for less than $.60 why would they charge $5.50 to ship? Oh thats right, it only cost a dollar to purchase. Beware no discount on mutiple orders, and does not qualify for Prime Shipping discounts!"
2,The Los Angeles Barrio; a moderate book,"I've seen beter, and I've seen worse. This book, though it has some good factual info, tends to whine and drag on into infinity. It lacks solid reasoning on it's assertions, and generally, excluding the factual info it contains, should not have gone to press. But, hey, with a topic like a The Los Angeles Barrio, how could it not. If you fell off a cliff, are stuck in traction and want to get some early California history to fall asleep to, this is the book to get."
4,Naked Airport - Good Book,"As an Architect, I found Mr. Gordon's book to be a very accessible read. This is not a coffee table book with glossy photographs and difficult to comprehend architectural theory. Instead he gives a very clear overview of the development of the airport building type, much like The Architecture of Diplomacy by Jane Loeffler does. He uses simple and tasteful photographs and graphics pared with a well written history. I would give this book a high mark and recommend it for both architects and non-architect. Thank you, Alastair Gordon for a nicely written book.Gregory KnoopOudens + Knoop Architects"
5,Wonderful history of airports,"This short book is a fascinating history of airport architecture. It is well presented--I used it in a freshman-level class on the aviation system--and the timeline makes it easy to relate to other cultural developments in society and technological developments in aviation. For anyone over 50, it's also a bit nostalgic--airports sure aren't what they used to be."
4,Impressive Debut Novel,"This book is enjoyable, and will keep you guessing. The author's characterization is impressive, you get a real sense of all the characters' P.O.V. and personality traits.Although there's somewhat of a lack of phyical description to the characters, the story keeps you focused and very interested on what these 4 people are going through. Good Read, I recommend it."
1,Lacking essential information,Who wants to buy a cord reel when the seller does not state the gauge of the wiring?
5,From America to The Netherlands within three weeks,"Our daughter was so happy receiving the book The Art of the Matroyshka for her school project. The book marvelous! Extreem beautiful pictures, so clear! A good story with much details. Very usable for the school project.We also were very pleased with the fast en accurate delivery.Many thanks, Robert"
2,Overpriced for what it is,"The book offers a very basic introduction to the history and traditionof matryoshkas, the kind of info available for free online. The dolls pictured aremainly the very basic, common designs. I was vey much disappointed with the book."
5,Toy Woodcraft in Russia,"This book is a wealth of information on Russian wooden toy and doll manufacture, especially the section on Sergei Posad, the major monasterysited in the Golden Ring at what was formerly known as Zagorsk.Founded by St Sergei of Radonyezh, carpenter and wood carver,it still produces Russian ethnic folk art.This book also covers the woods used, such birch or linden,which is common in my native land of Highland Scotlandas well as Russia. The processes for the production of matrioshkiis described in detail;as are the artists who paint them.A brilliant book!PS: Amazon.com promised arrival of this item to Scotland in 30 days.It took only two weeks to arrive. Well done Amazon and the shippersand a Happy New Year!John C Cameron, Easter Ross, Beautiful Sunny Scotland"
5,An eye opener.,"Along with the original Field Guide to Wilderness Survival, this is my favorite in the series. After reading about the ants I spent months trying to learn to track them. Finally, I achieved success after watching an ant walk across the top of a dusty outdoor water heater.I still can't do it on concrete though.It probably sounds stupid to some people, but it made me happy."
2,Don't bother with the extends and edits,"I had expected the alternate mixes of Machine + Soul, a great and under-rated piece of Numan's library, to be, well, alternative. Unlike other of Numan's promo mixes, like of My World Storm these versions, along with the ones on M+S 2, are just extended/edited mixes, with no differences in them really; with the two longer versions you can hear some newer material in the mix, but you hardly notice any difference between the edits and album version, and themselves, being that the shorter mixes have a fifteen second difference.The other songs you won't need to get this CD for because all reissued formats of the original album have them as bonus tracks. The only really valuable piece on these two EP's would be the 9 minute mix, which is on the second EP.Oh yeah, same goes with the Emotion single: extended and edited mixes with very little extra value."
1,False Advertising,Product appears to be complete with sink and ped.It does not come with the ped. It is the sink only andI could not get matching ped. A complete waste of money.
1,Interesting read,"Murray's claims have been discredited since the 1984 publication of this book. However, it is interesting to look into how Murray perceived the welfare issue 20 years ago."
2,"An example of political and racist ""science""","Murray's book is good for those racist republican white men, who don't understand the underlying socio-cultural-historical patterns, that makes the socioeconomic status of the blacks so diffrent from the whites."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK FOR OPEN-MINDED PEOPLE,"Those who have a closed mind will hate it because it clearly with use of time line graphs clearly show how inefective most of governemt's programs are. In fact, the only way you can debate the book is just to say ""it's nuts"" or ""don't confuse me with facts"" or some other ""argument"" like that. It's lucid, well-written and I'd even go as far as calling it revolutionary in its approach to analysing statistical data. It shows you, for example, how when you look at what happened AFTER a goverment program was put in place has not changed at all the pace of changes which were already taking place. In other words, the graphs slope hasn't changed. A super exapmple of logical thinking so much needed in today's society."
3,Interesting Conservative Take on the Welfare State,"This is a required book in my class on the American Welfare State. Much of it is a very fine, well-done study of welfare and its effects. The conclusions drawn from this are standard conservative claims, but they are a necessary and valuable aspect of thinking about American social policy. However, the book is nearly ruined by the end, where Murray attempts to relate smoking to poverty-a terrible, ridiculous example. However, the book is on the whole interesting-and infuriating-which is what a good ideological book should be. Thank you, Charles Murray, for reinforcing all of my liberal beliefs!"
2,Conservatives Unite!,"Charles Murray bends statistics and distorts history while trying to portray himself as a well intentioned scholar. His book, however, is little more than recylced conservative rhetoric from the Reagan era. Murray advocates dismantling welfare in favor of no holds barred capitalism, which he believes will best eliminate poverty. The most interesting aspect of the work comes when the author pushes for complete government funding of college education. Sloopy research and partisan language weight down this rarely engaging tribute to the merits of the free market and the failures of welfare. One can almost see Murray grinning through every page of Harrington's The Other America"
5,Much needed debate,"While the President and the Congress debate the levels of funding for the welfare state in the coming century, Charles Murray makes a very convincing arguement for why it should be done away with altogether. Replete with statistical analysis (including the raw data from federal government sources), Murray argues that should an outside observer review the statistics on the economic progress of blacks and the poor from about 1963 onward, without any social context, they would have to conclude that a systematic effort was afoot to ensnare a large group of people in perpetual poverty. Murray explains the dynamics behind the failure of welfare policy and argues a more generic case as to why nearly all government efforts to induce behavioral change in the population are doomed to failure. Murray's account is well supported, crystal clear, and highly thought-provoking. Recommended for all who wish to be involved in welfare policy or its debate for the coming century."
3,Inconsistent sizing,"I ordered 6 pair of size 6 to 7 1/2. The first pair I opened looked the right size so I opened all the packages and washed them all as recommended. Three pair fit correctly. The other three are still too large, even after repeated washings in hot water and hot dryer. Where's the quality control??? I didn't feel I could return the too large socks because they had been laundered and I had thrown out the packaging. I've had this same sizing problem with FootSmart orders. (These socks were shipped from FootSmart.) Otherwise I like the socks because they are thin and seamfree. I have foot swelling problems so thicker socks make my shoes feel too tight. Get some control of your sizing."
1,awful fit,"I bought these socks because I am allergic to the elastic in regular crew socks. I purchased the correct size based on my shoe size. They are so big--the heel is at my ankle. I do realize because there is no elastic to keep them up that they will sag a little, but they stretched so much that the top of the sock was about three inches bigger than my ankle. They do not fit and I would never recommend them based on my experience."
3,SIZES RUN BIG,Get the next smaller size if you want these socks not to slide down over your heel. And they get bigger with wear.
1,Not worth the price,"These socks are 100% which is excellent, but they are very thin and the price for only one pair of socks is quite high. There are other brands that offer better socks and more in a pack. Also, I think their sizing is off. I ordered the Women's 8.5-10 because I am a size 9, but the socks that showed up were huge."
3,Soft Soft Socks,"Very soft , but socks turn when I walk. A bit annoying, but still cushy! And that was what I wanted."
3,"soft-Fit Women's 100% Cotton Rolled Cuff Socks, White, Women's 8-19.5",These socks are very nice and soft but they do run big and the material is very thin. I am wondering how many washings they will last before falling apart.
3,Fails After A Few Washings,"I should have paid more attention to one of reviewers who claimed that the socks did NOT stay up after a few washings. I encountered the same behavior. They were very soft and comfortable the first couple of times I wore them. However after I washed them a couple of times, the socks started sliding down into my shoes when I walked. It became very uncomfortable and distracting. I finally had to find a different source of socks."
2,Too thin and too loose,"These socks were a lot thinner than I expected. Also, I like my socks to feel nice and smug on the leg, not partially falling down like these do. So all in all, I'm not very happy with these."
1,Poorly made socks,I washed one pair once and when I removed them from the dryer one sock had a big hole. I returned all of the socks. In terms of quality it doesn't get much worse than this.
2,Cotton Socks,"It is getting difficult to find all cotton socks so I was delighted to find them on Amazon. However, they are very thin, so I imagine will not last long. They are also very large, but probably will shrink when I wash them to a better size."
5,BARRY BENSON'S CIVIL WAR BOOK,"THIS BOOK TELLS IT LIKE IT WAS!!!!!! ANYONE WHO HAS A RELATIVE WHO FOUGHT FOR McGOWAN'S BRIGADE OR HAD RELATIVES AT THE UNION HELLHOLE, ELMIRA, WILL GREATLY ENJOY THIS BOOK.GARY, B/GENERAL SAMUEL McGOWAN, CAMP #40, SCV"
3,The Basics . . .,This is a collection of short stories (1921) about a police agent in Paris during the Napoleonic era.
3,Want Chocolate Cappuccino? Try CoolBeans pods instead,"I have tried them all. The Cool Beans Pods are the best for taste and value overall. They have 10+ grams per pod, the packaging in a delight, and they have a large variety of flavors. They are less expensive than the other gourmet coffee pods, having 25 pods per box for $10! Coolbeanspods.com. And no, I am not an employee of Cool Beans. Just a coffee lover!"
3,Kindle version,Rather disappointed with the kindle format. Instead of the landscape orientation (iPad) making the pictures larger it put two very small pages on one. Given that the pictures are an important part of this book this was surprising.
5,Fun intro to classic nursery rhymes,"This is a nice board book to introduce your child to nursery rhymes. The illustrations are clever, and there are small hidden details that even keep an older child interested. While the book does not actually tell any of the classics, as the reader you can explain them bit by bit as your child grows."
4,"Entertaining, very cute book.","This was purchased for my 4-year old daughter. She thoroughly enjoys it. It's a cute, shorter book. The rhymes and finding the characters make it a charming book to add to any book collection."
4,Plot Flaw,This would be a wonderful children's story if it were not for a critical plot flaw. The rhyme and meter roll off the tongue and the pictures are engaging. The flaw comes in the subplot developed in the pictures. The Wicked Witch is being attacked by Robin Hood in the middle of this book. Yet with no explanation these characters reconcile by the last page.Overall this is a good book. It would be excellent were it not for this glaring inconsistency.
2,Too many guns for an otherwise sweet book.,"We just weeded this book out of our collection.While thiswould be an otherwise charming book, there are simply too many pageswith the characters toting guns.This is not meant to be censorship.But we feel kids are exposed to guns everywhere in our culture, so whynot filter a few out when we can?Let's reward the writers andpublishers who print gun-free books.There are SO MANY wonderfulbooks for kids out there. We're taking the small step of weeding outbooks with guns until our kids are a bit older."
5,My Favorite Book,I hardly ever read as a child but I loved reading Each Peach Pear Plum. This book gives children a chance to use more than just their reading skills. Most children should already be familiar with the characters in the book and with the information they already know about the characters they can expand the story with their imaginations. This book may help them think outside of the book and they may ask questions about why the character might be where they are and why? This book may be very simple but it is a terrific book for young children.
5,Childhood favorite,"This is one of my favorite books from childhood. It is beautifully illustrated with simple verses that are not too complicated for those just learning to read. It's probably been 15 or 20 years since I've seen this book, but I still remember each verse."
4,A Board Book With Several Layers of Interaction,"This is a baby board book with a better-than-average illustrations, and accompanying rhyming verse. There is an ""I spy"" component where the text indicates the reader should look for characters from nursery rhyme and fairy tale characters. An excellent addition to a board book collection which will maintain interest through the time a child is ready to follow a story line."
4,"Good book, apparently a classic (who knew?)","This is a good book of a few rhyming couplets featuring fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters, perfect length to catch the attention of a young child - and enough detail in the pictures to keep the attention of an older one!For those people who are concerned about this sort of thing, there are some references to ""the Wicked Witch"" (she's not shown being any more wicked than anybody else, and she eats pie with her neighbors at the end. Wicked is just her name, I guess) in the book, and there are also a few images of the three bears being very careless with guns while hunting. I don't find that this hampers our enjoyment of this book, but if these are sensitive topics for your family, you may want to check the book out of the library before committing to a purchase."
5,My Favorite Childhood Book,"This book is very special to me, its great for kids headed to kindergarten. Its easy to read and adds a twist by having the child find something hidden on each page. I just bought it for my daughter, after I, twenty years ago, turned it in for a school book drive. I love it and would recommend it to anyone with a child."
4,Rips Through the Old Tale with Clever Animation,"This Claymation version of Irving's ""Rip Van Winkle"" offers a fairly accurate retelling of the legend. What sets it apart, however, is the delightfully complex clay animation. Facial expressions and moods are clearly shown in the animated figures, bringing surprising life to each and every character.The songs are simple and offer good insight into the story's interpretation.The film is generally geared towards children, but adults certainly can appreciate the artistry.This one is definitely worth the purchase as a visual aid to teaching the old tale in most classrooms."
5,If you are going to write a review do it right,It's completely understandable if a certain piece of literature isn't suited to your personal tastes but to bash a work that is clearly of literary and historical value without even giving concrete reasons I can only attribute to a gross lack of understanding and general stupidity.
4,great book,Incredibly written book taking you through this journey of a sickness not well know or understood. Julie's grace towards her mother despite it all and poetic recollection makes this book a must read. What a courageous girl.
5,A Very Powerful Book,I was up into the very late hours reading this. As a mother it was heartbreaking to read. The author shows how strong the parental bond can be even in the worst of circumstances. I anxiously await her next book.
3,A little disappointing.,"This had the potential to be a really great book, but there were some disappointments. While I find the topic to be very interesting and I sympathize with what happened, I wasn't really into the writing style. The story jumped around quite a bit without much explanation making things a little confusing at times. The overuse of metaphors and similes, and attempts at being poetic, kind of strangled the story. It just started to sound ridiculous and a little fake. There were a lot of very interesting details in this story, but some of them were never followed up on and left me wondering what the heck happened while others seemed completely unnecessary. Some parts I raced through and couldn't wait to see what happened next, but others dragged and I thought maybe I'd just stop reading it altogether. It has it's interesting points even if it's not much of a page turner. If you can deal with the writing style, it's an okay read."
4,Sad,"This book had me from the beginning. The story is gruesome, and made me cry. People think it's fake, I think that is because they ouldn't imagine a mother doing this. Over all I thought it was a good read and very insightful."
3,Book was damaged.,"Lower rating, even though good price and prompt service. Two pages of the book were ripped out, so missing pages 9-12. Plot can still be figured out, so I won't need a replacement."
3,Brimming with unnecessary details,"I was anxious to read ""Sickened"" as the bizarre disorder of 'Munchausen By Proxy' is an interesting and twisted piece of abnormal psychology, however, I was disappointed with this book overall. Although Julie Gregory has a compelling story to tell, I felt her book was overly detailed with extensive 'filler' material and was brimming with unnecessary details; ultimately making this book boring and a long read."
2,Sickened: The True Story of a Lost girl,"Oprah needs to recommend this book, then have the author come on the show and give her a whoppin' for writing trash. Julie Gregory could have had something with substance, but after the first 100 pages,she was all over the road and totally lost it. The copies of the letterd and medical charts cannot be viewed (too small) and she wrote in a ""fiction"" style. Don't waste your time."
5,Drinking Doesn't Help,I thought a glass of wine might help take the edge off of Julie Gregory's brutal autobiography of growing up as the victim of Munchausen by Proxy. It didn't.Julie Gregory is incredibly brave to lay herself out for public scrutiny. I hope this tome will help raise awareness for this condition. This book is impossible to put down until the last gut-wrenching page.
4,Beautifully Written,"Sickened is a story displaying the depth of a child's love for her mother and the strength it took to ultimately break away and save herself. I will not give away the story. It is enough to say this is a very interesting, well written book."
4,Sad,"It amazes me that this was allowed to go on as long as it did. Doctors, Nurses etc.. Just sad, and this is far from an isolated case, my heart goes out to this girl who is now a woman and I hope she has been able to truly put this behind her, but I'm not sure that is possible. Children are innocents and need protection, just sad."
5,Perfect accessory for the DSlite or DSi,"I have the DSi and it fits just fine in this holder. My hands get really sore from playing games with lots of action in them and when I want to play with the stylist, this gives me a hands free way to play. I like this stand so much, I am buying a second one just to put aside in case anything should happen to the one I have! I will recommend you glue in the little corner pads... mine should snap in but they don't. They tend to pop out everytime I take my system from the holder. This is a little thing to me. The comfort in using this product far outweighs this little annoying thing. This is made from heavy plastic so it is not something that will break easily. The only thing I would change about it is putting on a stylist holder for when you are taking a break. It will fit on the bottom edge of the holder, but can be hard to get out if you have tired fingers like I have from so much game play. I am disabled and this just made my life easier to game on."
2,DS stand,Used this stand once and didn't care for it. It's in a drawer somewhere and doubt I will ever use it again.
2,one of My boys bought Me this and.........,"This cam is [...]! IT CLAIMS TO BE ""Weatherproof."" in its add here and its NOT you can NOT have it outside, it says do not put in the rain, do NOT put in moist areas and do NOT put in sunlight, how the heck is THAT weatherproof???? oh AND the LED lights dont even work at all!! on the good side of things it works perfect in the day time, good clear picture, I don't know about sound cause after all I have to have it pointing out a INSIDE window to the outside so I dont have the sound on. I guess this is what you get for 50 bucks, a half way working cam that the ad lies!"
3,Rat Dissection Manual,Old style graphics and old copyright- Although anatomy changes little within a 50 yr period. Good resource book but a bit too advanced for high school level- book would be better used at college level.
5,Book based on natural history,"This is a good, quick read that cuts to the heart of how monitors live and how to use that information to keep captives. Highly recommended and at a VERY reasonable price."
2,I am a high school teacher,"As a teacher, I found this book pretty usless. Overall most all education books are worthless nonsense as it's unlike teaching people but running a science lab. Yes, there are good things in here to some degree, but I would find some better way to spend my time to make my teaching better than read this, perhaps make up better lesson plans or a great simulation or power point...? Good luck. I suppose if you want to be a Dr. in Education you might reall like this book, but then please don't make me take anymore worthless classes in which I have to read things like this to keep my job. Thanks."
4,helpful,This guide book was really helpful to finding the uses for the proper coding. Every-time i would get stuck on a problem i could easily look it up with this book. I'd recommend it for anyone who is studying in the programing feild.
2,mistletoe audiobook review,"I must admit - I didn't ""read"" this. I listened to it during my commute. I picked up the audio book at the library. If you're interested in going that route, the reader is not too talented but doesn't sound like a robot so it was okay. This is a mystery surrounding the murder of a cat therapist. The sleuth is a rather dim-witted out-of-work actress now catsitter. The suspects are cat therapy clients and a giggalo husband (Romanian defector). The story is not at all believable - not the plot, not the characters, ... eh, maybe the cats' ailments. Still, it has its entertaining moments. Don't buy it if you are looking for well-written literature. If you're looking for silly brain candy with lots of cats involved, go right ahead."
2,Did Not Enjoy This Book,"This was suppose to be a cozy mystery, but I could not get into the book. It was not cozy enough for me. I had to put it down and then pick it back up later to finish. I will not read anymore books in this series."
5,What a Southerner Won't Tell You,"Having been born in Mississippi and having defected to the West at the age of 23, I picked up Wilke's book to get in touch with my ""Southern roots"". Wilke's account of his roots and his involvement with the civil rights movement is more than any of my high school and college history books could ever explain.Progressive Curtis Wilke made me realize I should be proud of my heritage but also aghast at what caused all of these atrocities and racist views. The South's dirty laundry is something that needs to be acknowledged in order to overcome the past."
4,Touchdown!!! ............But missed the extra point!,"I like football, but I was always a little hazy on it's early history. The who, what, when and how of the teams and the game's important people. This book nailed that perfectly!! It's a well written, easy read that lays out the important parts of the NFL's history. A complete touchdown.Where the book misses the extra point is when the author tries to explain why football is America's most popular game. When doing this it seems as if he is directing the book towards fans of other sports, (especially baseball)as if to say ""football is the best, so there!"" Basically I think the problem is football is the most popular sport for so many reasons the author is trying to explain something that cannot easily be explained. It's like trying to explain to someone why their favorite color is blue.But overall this is a great book. If you are looking to find out more about the history of the NFL, this is the book for you."
4,Better than HP 4500,"I have had this printer for 2 months. I use it at home. We use a HP 4500 at my place of employment. Comparing the two printers. The QMS is much faster than HP even though it has half the memory (QMS-32mb compared to HP-64mb) The performance is amazing for such a reasonably priced color laser printer. I would recommend it to any seeking an economical, yet speedy printer. By the way, I loved the ... rebate."
3,this Korean drama was ... dramatic,"I thought Id give one of these Korean dramas a whirl for my wife. We also have a couple of boys 7 & 13 at the time. We were all hooked, and enjoyed watching the series. However, somewhere around disc 7 or so, the drama got a little too dramatic; too many barely missed connections, too many tradgedies, too many misunderstandings. Perhaps if you are a fan of these thats what its all about. The great thing for us is that we have new family soundtrack! Its amazing how many simple situations in life can become quite entertaining when accompanied by a few hummed bars of the Autumn in my Heart theme. Miss the bus? run deperately behind it arms outstreached while humming. Goldfish died? da.. da-da-da de da... etc, etc. So, Im probably not going to watch this again, but Id probably buy it again if I had it to do over. Your tastes may vary..."
5,One of the BEST Korean dramas,"This is one of my most favorite Korean drama series! It is an interesting story of hardship and love that utilizes many K-Drama themes (rich vs poor, love triangles, and fate). Despite using such conventional themes, it is unique, touching and beautifully done. In addition, it's stars are some of the most attractive ever!Warning: Do not watch unless you have a huge box of Kleenex."
2,Too Sad,"After sitting through 12 episodes and crying in each one, I decided to check Wikipedia to see how it ended. I could not sit through the remainder if the ending was sad. Sure enough, it was extremely sad. This movie, in my opinion, was a real downer. I deleted all the episodes.If you want to see a thoroughly entertaining and funny movie, watch ""Pasta"", another Korean movie. The actors are wonderful, there are many funny moments, and best of all, the ending is so satisfying and happy."
3,need a sense of humor,"The English subtitles are pretty awful. For instance, ""tie seat belt,"" ""father him knowing cancer have long time"" and ""I will fetch you"" when they mean I'll take you there. But if you have a sense of humor, it's all part of the experience and actually quite fun coupled with a real tearjerker.AUTUMN IN MY HEART KOREAN DRAMA 8 DVDs with English Subtitles"
5,Geat stuff,"I really love that this book is about changing my own heart, and not my mate's heart. If applied, the truths in this book are transforming."
4,Works for the price,"I wasn't expecting a pro piece of equipment when I ordered this, but rather, only something that would make ironing an easier task for me (hate it, can't-won't do it). Once you get the hang of it, this thing actually works well, however I wouldn't say steaming is faster or better than ironing, it's just different. Obviously, you can't do folds or crimps on trousers, but it does a great job on dresses/skirts/tops (specially ones with flowy, soft fabrics). In fact, one of the best uses I found for it is deodorizing long-stored ""humid stinky"" clothes: 5-10 min steaming on a formal gown washed 6 months ago was enough to wear it confidently to a last minute fancy event. By the way, all the ""dangerous performance"", steam burns, etc. commented on some reviews CAN be avoided handling the device with common sense and being faily careful the first times you use it. =)"
4,Great Value for the Money !!!!,"I love this product. It works great and is so affordable. I don't think it takes too long to heat up at all and the hose losens up after the first two uses. It is so portable that I would consider taking this on a road trip if need be. I no longer iron the old fashion way. This is so much quicker than ironing. The only thing is I wish it did work longer than 20 minutes. That is the only con I have with the product. But if you are just getting an outfit ready for work this is all you need. If you are doing more at a shot, then you will need to refill it."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For,I am a semi-professional photographer and I was looking for a nice compact steamer to use in my small studio. I saw this unit and decided to give it a try. Works great at removing wrinkles in my backgrounds and makes it much easier than trying to iron and place back up on stands without wrinkles. Great product.
1,As much work as ironing,"For the price, it IS amazing that this steamer does anything, which accounts for all the rave reviews. This little number is not real powerful, so you don't get the effortless, quick steamer results that most of us seek. The steam output is low, so you go over and over the garment, with little improvement. Forget about using it on linen. Even on thin cotton, it creates tiny spider wrinkles. You have to hold the hose vertically to prevent water from spurting, which is awkward and dangerous, as the hose gets HOT. You have to have a door near an electrical outlet. Then the hook doesn't fit over the thickness of the door, nor does the hose reach the item hanging from it. It is as much work as ironing, but with ironing, you can eventually achieve the desired result. The steamer is compact, heats quickly and doesn't take up much room. I returned mine, but there may be a few people who like this steamer."
4,It does what it's supposed to,"I've read some of the reviews about this product and the biggest complaint seems to be that the head sometimes gets water on the garment. I only get spots when I try and use it on something laid flat because the water condenses in the head. It will also condense in the hose and if the hose drops below the steamer it gurgles. This really is not a tabletop item, it has to be used on the floor. I've used it on just about all my cloths: khakis, polos, button-down shirts and it does a reasonably good job. If I have one complaint about it, it is that the cord is too short. and with the steamer on the floor, it will barely reach the top of an item hung using the over-the-door hook. I also wish it had a way to fill the reservoir (which is only 8 oz.) with out removing the hose. Overall, I think for the price that I paid, I got my moneys worth, after all it's just a tea kettle with a hose."
4,Plenty of steam,I liked this little steamer very much. It did a great job. The only thing I wasn't happy about is that it has to be placed on the floor and the hose wasn't long enough to reach the top of the drapes that I was steaming. It also did spit out some water occassionally.
2,Not Very Impressed,"After reading the reviews below, I was looking forward to having an effective, cheap steamer on hand. However, this Conair doesn't do the job. It starts emitting steam quickly but the steam had little impact on the condition of my dress shirts and suits. To get even modest results, I had to tug on the fabric to pull the wrinkles out. GIven the time and effort it takes, I'd rather just iron."
1,you get what you pay for!!!!!,"I researched steamers and read many reviews. I decided to purchase this one and it worked great the first time and the second time was a desaster, it drenched my clothes and my floor. I also burned my thumb. I would not recommend this steamer to anyone. :("
1,Hate it. Just hate it,"Ugh. This thing is the pits. I generally like Conair products, but not this steamer.I don't even fill the water to the MAX line, and the steamer spurts water all over my clothing, AND it drips on the floor; and I wait for it to fully heat up. I could deal with that if it did a decent job steaming, but it is marginal at best - and I've tried it on barely wrinkled cotton clothing, not heavier fabrics/drapery/bedspreads. The steam doesn't feel all that hot - I've accidentally ran my hand in the path of the steam and it isn't uncomfortable at all. My mom has a steamer that she bought at Costco for about $40, that blows this thing out of the water - instant wrinkle release, no drips or sputtering, excellent results. Guess I'm headed to Costco soon to see if they still have one."
1,Not worth the money!,"This did not do what it said it would do..I couldn't get the wrinkles out..I returned the item, Amazon refunded my money as they are so gracious to do. Amazon is a great company to do business with..they stand behind everything they sell.But this product simply did not measure up to claims."
1,"finally bought it, and dispointed","Have been researching for a steamer for quite a while. This unit has been in my mind since then due to its good price and good amazon review. Finally got it weeks ago, hoping to use it for the holiday. However, after several minutes, it almost ruined my suit. The point is that there is quite some water coming out together with the steam, and the water left marks on the clothe."
1,Takes forever to heat up and spits!,This steamer takes at least 5 minutes to heat up. I filled it exactly to the maximum line and it spits all over the clothes. You have to hang the clothes high up to be able to keep it from spitting more than it does.I could have two shirts ironed and done while waiting for this machine to heat up! It's also very noisy and sounds like it's going to explode.
2,Won't replace your iron.,"Bought this today after researching it online. It took a little too long to heat up, and after using it for 20 minutes, I wasn't impressed. It takes about as long to steam a shirt as it would have to iron it, and frankly I was disappointed with the results. Sure it removed most of the wrinkles, but didn't leave the smooth look and feel of being freshly pressed. As someone said earlier, if you think this will replace your iron, you're sadly mistaken. My iron is coming back out, and the steamer is going back."
2,Finicky,"I've had this product for a year or so, and I've held onto it because I liked it better than the travel steamer I had before it, but it has a lot of problems. I can't fill it with more than a few cups of water or it spits up boiling water rather than steam, causing several burns on my hands and arms. Running it on so little water means I run out after only a few garments and I have to refill and wait 4-5 minutes for it to heat up again. There's no way to clean out the resevoir, except to steam vinegar, and then it's very difficult to get it to stop smelling like vinegar for weeks after a cleaning! Now it's developed a leak and leaves puddles on the floor. I'm shopping for a better brand to replace this."
5,Great,"I bought this steamer about 7 years or so ago, and I still have it. It works great I've traveled all over with it and it a joy to own."
4,Steamer,This is my first steamer and although I have only used it once. It seems easy to use and effective.
3,not bad,"Steamer took a while to heat up. Using door hanger was quite awkward, as tube didn't want to flex freely to reach garment. Cord length didn't allow door to be opened while in use, so I had to remove steamer and place to the side to get the next garment from the hotel closet. Did, in fact, steam quite well once we got the set-up taken care of. Bonus- makes an array of awesome gastrointestinal noises! Bad side- Be careful with screwing the hose back on after refilling while hot! The lid jammed the second time I used it, took three days and a liberal application of elbow grease to open. Wouldn't work correctly during that period."
4,Works great,This think works great. It is a little bulky and I wish the hose was just a bit longer but overall it does the job. It heats up quickly and holds enough water to get the job done.Overall it gets an A
5,ConAir steamer,I've had the product for a month. Used it everyday. Item works as promissed. i can steam 2 shirts on a full tank of water.
3,Ok for home use..,This product was easy to set up...but it is slow to produce steam and doesn't last long or put out a good amount of steam when it's on. It also gurgles and spits occasionally...but I think they all do. I returned it and got a Shark from Target. Cheaper then a Jiffy but actually works better...for how long it lasts is another question. This item is good if you only have one or two things for steaming. Good luck.
2,Not what I expected,"I labored over getting a fabric steamer for months and months. After reading everyones reviews, I finally chose this model. It is cumbersome and though it took wrinkles out, it is no substitute for ironing."
2,Steamer,"I bought this because I thought ironing was too much of a chore. This thing is too much of a hassle for the results. It works better on thinner fabrics and it's good to have around for delicate pieces, though."
2,CORD TOO SHORT!!!!,"I make many purchases from Amazon and very seldom have returned anything, but I guess I should have read the other reviews before buying this steamer! I wanted to avoid having to set up my Rowenta iron and the ironing board to do a quick pressing of a garment. The steamer MAY have performed well if I could have used it, but the cord was too short (6 ft.)to reach the outlet. Since this uses an ""over the door"" hook for the steam nozzle, I guess Conair thinks everone has an electic outlet right beside every door!!! WAKE UP CONAIR!!!! My Rowenta iron has a 10 ft. cord! I was very disappointed with this product."
1,Makes the Garmet More Wrinkly,"OK, so I was excited about this new purchase, however, the steam took out the wrinkles, but removes any starch and hard pressed fabrics. You wear the garmet for 1/2 hour and then you have triple the wrinkles. This product is a good idea, but in reality it doesn't work like you think it will."
3,Works ok - no need for Iron - gets a little wet,"I have limited space in my FEMA trailer, this sucka works good. Not long to produce steam gets all the wrinkels out."
2,"Cheap, but it won't replace your iron.","I read the reviews, and decided to give a chance to this steamer. It is simple to operate - fill the steamer with water, plug it in, wait a couple of minutes. I waited for a while hoping to get the ""continuous steam through high-velocity jets..."". Nothing like that, though. Just a weak steam that WILL NOT take the wrinkles out of most shirts or trousers. So don't expect this piece of equipment to replace your iron or visit to the dry cleaners.However, I believe this could work fine with special care (maybe silk) pieces. But don't expect it to save you time, as you have to go slowly over your clothing - just as you will do with an iron.I give it 2 stars because of its price (saw it on CVS and Kmart for around 30 bucks) and how easy it is to use. And although it won't replace the iron or dry cleaners, it can become handy for some materials that shouldn't be ironed."
1,don't buy this,"I bought this because there were a lot of good reviews, so I expected to get a good outcome. What I got were wet clothes. It just makes your clothes wet, it doesn't remove wrinkles. Yes, the steam is hot, but with all the water droplets coming out of it it doesn't make a good steamer. I held it upright, I always make sure that the hose is straight, but the water just keeps on coming out which makes your clothes wet."
4,works for us,It does its job. Just remember to always throw out the unused water from the tank to prevent mold.
1,Not worth it,I got this product thinking that it would replace my iron and ironing board - I was wrong! It is not strong enough to take the wrinkles out of khaki pants or oxford shirts that are a cotton/polyester blend. The clothes do not hold their shape either. It took me longer to steam a pair of pants than it would have for me to just iron them because of how you have to tough at the pants to make the fabric straight for the steamer. I guess I was looking for an easy way out of ironing and this product was definitely not it!
4,Good for the price,"I bought this steamer to use on new silk curtains, which were creased. For the price, it works fine. It takes a little while to heat up but once it's hot, it produces plenty of steam.The hose collects quite a bit of water, and makes snapping sounds. It can also leave drips on the fabric and the floor. Be very carfeful, as water drops can leave marks on silk. Also the drips are very hot, and can burn you.I looked at other professional steamers, and they were just too expensive. This works for any small steam application such as curtains, tablecloth, formal dresses, etc."
3,Good gadget to home use,"It's easy to assemble, nice to use. Not much powerfull (you get to execise some patience), but do what it promisses."
1,Do not waste your money on this,"it's essentially a boiling pot of water that has a hose connected to it. It took me double the time to try and steam my clothes, and I ended up burning myself multiple times and having large blotches of water on my clothes. Purchase the Steamfast model. It's works great."
2,get something better,This little steamer spits out water and the hose gets SUPER hot! I am looking to sell this one at our garage sale and upgrade.
3,Works well but not powerful enough for my curtains,"I like this steamer fine but unfortunately it's not powerful enough for my curtains, they are too heavy. But the steamer works great for lighter fabrics and helped take off a wallpaper border."
1,Broke after only owning a few months,"I knew when I purchased this that it wasn't going to last me a life time but after only using it 4 times it broke. Problem? When you rest the hose head on the hook it has a hard time staying there, it slipped of course and fell to the floor to break into a handful of pieces. Not worth it, now I will be willing to spend a little more money for one that is better quality."
1,Not worth the time or money,"I ordered the steamer based on the mos recent good reviews. My primary use for it was to steam my work clothes, which mainly consists of business casual items. It worked very well the first day, then the days following it, it began to spit a significant amount of water. My pants were SOAKED and couldn't wear them AND it spilled a puddle of water on the floor. I tried giving it a chance by reading the pamphlet that came with it, and attempted to troubleshoot as per their instructions. Well, it didn't work! Did the same exact thing the following day, and decided to just return it. Too bad it didn't work because the price and compact size was exactly what I was looking for."
1,Have tried it for 2 years,"This system is just horrible, spits water all over clothing doesn't take out wrinkles, every time I try it I'm just praying it will work like it's supposed to and it never does.Just not a good product!"
2,hard to get the wrinkles out entirely,I've only used an expensive one while out of town at a friends and was so happy with it. This is smaller but very hard to work with and couldn't get all the wrinkles out. It's not that great. Burned my hands a couple times trying to meneuver it around.
1,Doesn't get the job done,"This steamer really does not get the job done. When it isn't sputter water all over, it is fine to touch up a suit jacket. But it does a terrible job on shirts and pants. I've found that when I use this for dress shirts or khakis, it does not come close to removing the wrinkles, and I still have to iron.Terrible product. I would avoid."
3,good,"ok it is light, small and easy to move around. my only problem is that it does not produce continuous steam. it start and then stops for a few seconds to build steam. however it is very handy. i use it on my bed, curtains and clothes and it does exactly what they say it does."
4,Inexpensive and easier than the iron!,"I use the steamer to freshen up oxford shirts and dress pants to save trips to the dry cleaner. It takes a little while to warm up, but it works well enough that I save more than it's purchase price in dry cleaning bills in less than a month.The cord is a bit short, and the tends to make a bit of gurgling noise, but overall it's pretty good."
1,Other steamers are soooooo much better,I've used a lot of good steamers--this is not one of them.1) Takes forever to heat up2) Spits water3) No place to put nozzle (get one with a vertical pole)4) Hose too short5) Calcifies after 1 use and no easy way to clean it.I'm returning mine and getting a better one. You get what you pay for.
4,Good with almost all clothing,"It is very efficient. it is excellent with kids clothing, shirts and jeans, no matter the size. but with executive clothing is not that good. in overall is excellent with 80% of the clothing. it saves a lot of time though."
1,BEWARE ... SLOW WARMUP TIME,I read all the rave reviews here and bought one of these with confidence .. BUT was most disappointed .. the warmup time is a full 8 min and then you only have limited steaming time. But worse than all that is that you have to remove the hose to fill the base with water and it's all made of plastic .. hard to open and easy to break. I'm returning mine and going to try the mid priced Conair Ionic one .. hoping for faster warm up time and a sturdier unit.
4,A fine starter steamer,"I've had this steamer for over a year. I initially bought it as a low-cost experiment to see if I could get away from ironing. At first I was very enthusiastic about the product, because I could steam dress shirts and pants much faster than I could iron them, and with acceptable results. I was also able to deodorize wool sweaters in about one minute. After a few months, however, I was frustrated with not being able to make creases, so I went back to ironing my shirts. But I found that it took such a long time for ironing to get a better result than steaming that it was only rarely worth it. So I'm sold on the concept of steaming, but I'm considering investing in a higher end steamer to handle dress shirts and pants. For my first steamer, it has been a fine product. I'd say that the experiment was worth it."
4,Awesome but be careful!,"I purchased this yesterday and I am happy that I did. I was looking for a quick way to take those dang wrinkles out of my husband's and my clothes. I really don't have the time to iron all our clothes so this was an investment for me. I took this little device for a test drive yesterday night and all was well except when it started spewing out water. I did not over fill it, rather it started spewing when it got to the ""refill"" line. I put a thin cloth over the steamer and tied it so it won't spew water on the clothes. Over all, the machine works fine and it is definitely worth the price."
1,Not worth the trouble..,"I gave the steamer a fair try. First time I used..worked okay, took awhile to get the wrinkles out of an average 80% cotton blouse..longer than I thought it would but for the price compared to the much more expensive steamers, that's what was expected. 2nd use and it sputtered, spewed water all over my shirt constantly and it was a complete mess. Had to steam even LONGER this time as it was producing more water spewage than steam and the shirt was completely wet with so much steam and all the sputtering of water. Checked settings, hose, water level, instructions..no use. Completely unwearable shirt and unusable product. Not happy and am returning."
3,"Okay, but not a lifesaver","I thought that getting this would cut my ironing time in half, but really, it didn't. Basically, it's kind of like ironing on a vertical axis, rather than the traditional horizontal. It takes a while, and you have less control over where the wrinkles come out. It's a great addition to your home for things that you can't iron at all, like silks, so I would definately recomment this inexpensive model. However, if you think this will remove all wrinkles and the need to bring out the ironing board, you'll be disappointed."
1,messy!,"This product is cheap comparing to the others, but it doesn't work, so I guess its expensive since my shower steam does a better job than this little guy... I recommend spending a little more on something better that you won't regret like I did. It didn't take the wrinkles off but left my clothes dump to the point that I couldn't use it anymore at the same day."
3,Missing pieces ??,"This isn't really a review - more like a comment:I didn't use the product right away, so did not notice, nor realize that a few pieces were missing - the lint attachment, rigid comb attachment, and the crease attachment. Aren't these all part of the package?I do however like the size and the fact that it doesn't weigh much - easy to lift and manuver."
2,Not what it seems,"When I received this item I had a death in my immediate family and was not able to open it to return it on time. The item had been used prior to me buying it even though it's advertised as new. There was a calcium build up in the inside of the container. Another thing is that beware that none of the attachments are included, which was my fault I guess I should've read but its a good heads up. I've never had a problem before with anything I got from Amazon but it really pissed me off that it was used before."
2,Disappointed,didnt work well. took too long to get hot and because the coil is so long it took forever for the steam to start
1,Very difficult to use,"I thought this would be simple to use. First of all, even if I hang my clothes up to steam, I like to have a hand free to hold the sleeve and move the item while I steam. With this Steamer, I had to use one hand to hold the steamer and the other to hold the steamer wand... that left no hands free. Not to mention that the hose was tight and short and wasn't easy to maneuver. I ended up just sticking it in the top of my closet and then selling it at a yard sale for $5 because it wasn't worth the time or effort..."
3,A little disappointed,After reading the reviews on this product I felt that it would be perfect for my application but after using it I was disappointed. I purchased it because I thought it was going to be a quick way to take out the wrinkles on my shirts for work. This works great on everything except for dress shirts for guys which is why I gave it 3 stars. I would not recommend this unit for guy's dress shirts.
2,not so good,"I read the same complaints and thought the same thing DUH, read instructions but the first three x it seemed ok, now it is spitting and very awkward, and takes a long time to get steam going.I am looking for a new one."
3,It is okay!,"This is the second steamer that I bought. This one was cheaper and it is not as good as the more expensive model but it is okay. It does the job but it takes longer than the other one because it does not give off the same amount of steam.It does everything it is supposed to do and if time is not an issue, I recommend it."
2,Don't Buy,"I purchased this product hoping to get a good deal. I thought since this was a Conair product it would be quality. I was wrong on both fronts. It takes 20 minutes before the steam starts, and then there is not enough power so while your steaming water drips on your clothes. I would have returned it, but my wife through away the box. I have used a garment steamer in the past, and I have friends that have one. We agree that the key to a good garment steamer is 1200+ watts."
2,Not impressed,#1 It does not put out enough steam and #2 it does not have a steam switch/button to release the steam or not release stem...instead it is continual steam...but it's paltry.I returned it--It did not do a better job than the pressure water spray bottle I have been using to finely mist my clothes (which works great)
1,I HATE THIS THING,"this product is not woth wasting your money on..... wen i first got it i was so excited to try it out so i quiclky within 30 sec assembled it, and filled it with water it took about 6 min for steam to come out and i didnt even fill it all the way up, and another reason i hate this product is beacause it clearly states in the description Safely removes wrinkles from curtains, linens, delicate clothing ""cool-touch hose and handle"" LIE after the steam starts to come out the hose and handle get hot also, and while i was trying to steam a shirt the stupid thing was making noises as if it were going to blow up, and it kept spitting out water..... NOT WORTH WAISTING YOUR MONEY."
1,Doesn't do the job,"If you are buying this to replace your iron, forget it. It doesn't do the job. I bought a new shirt and was hoping to iron out the creases in it before wearing it to work. It did a partial job of removing the creases but they were still visible after multiple passes.I bought a much cheaper portable steamer a while back and that does a much better job. As another reviewer stated, this one just spits out water and does not produce a good jet of steam. Just forget it and buy something else."
1,Just Plain Lousy,"When I ordered this book, I was hoping for more than a cursory look at some of the great scams and cons throughout history. It fell woefully short in many respects. It seems to me that Ms. Faron has learned all she knows from watching a Discovery Channel special or movies, such as The Sting, Traveller, or Paper Moon. It provides nothing in the way of original insight or research. The author's writing style is disjointed and confused. It jumps between subjects quickly without segues. I can see how non-writers can be interested in this book, but as it sells itself as a guide to help an author with character and plot development, I expect a little more than ""You might want your character to do this...""I do admit that the title is fully fitting. Ms. Faron has conned us buyers."
1,um maybe not,rick loveother books but u made a boo boo this book.srry. big fa though of percy carter sadie jason piper annabeth leo grover exc exc icould go on on and on. haahahhaaha
3,Nice watch but photo is misleading,No complaints except that photo on Amazon makes the watch look more like brass or a more muted gold -- when in fact the watch is actually a shiny bright gold.
5,very helpful,"very helpful book like all Dr n Walker's books they are all interesting. I would advise reading ""Fresh vegetable and fruit juices"" first then this book makes more sense."
5,A Classic,"I'm into the health food movement like a lot of people nowdays. Unfortunately most books and programs don't cover all of the many ways to get and stay healthy. Although the above book listed is an excellent resource. It's like most authors and programs are trying to be too pc (politically correct). To correct myself a little, most health advice, programs, books and supplements usually offer pretty good advice these days.You know:1. Don't alcohol2. Don't abuse drugs3. Don't smoke (cigaretts and the like)4. Eat move live fresh fruits and vegetables.5. Eat less process foods and meats.Now all of this is good advice, although there is a right way and wrong way to do anything. I saw an excellent book with a good 8 step plan. Search Amazon for: The Magic Of Mother Nature's Healing Foods. I liked it."
2,"repetitive, cult-like","Repetitive, cult-like...How many times can you repeat the phrase ""colonic irrigation"" in one book, supposed to treat about vegetables?Extra star for the vegatable reference list in the second half of the book."
5,Plunge router attachment is a worthy accessory,"Very easy to attach and adjust to the perfect height to router. Base is very stable and sturdy. As others have mentioned, the rotozip is not to be considered a replacement for a 1hp router. There simple is not enough power. However, this is absolutely perfect for the hobby shop. I rounded off 3/8"" walnut but made two passes to get through it. This attachment is an absolute requirement for flushing laminates with your rotozip as well. A good investment to get more out of your tool."
1,Only as good as the Rotozip itself,The Rotozip is good for starting fires........not cutting wood. Stick with a recipricating saw for cutting wood and a real router for routing work. You will be much happier.
3,Cute ornament,"Nice saying on card and card is nice holder for ornament, but actual ornament doesn't have the word 'godmother' on it."
4,Great,"I have a 4 year old PC and this runs perfectly. No problems with hardware or software. All the eye candy you can imagine, plus, i ordered this as an additional addon to my laptop, also perfect. don't listen to nay sayers. This will work, run the Vista Compatibility program from MS before buying to make sure your system will take any version of Vista."
2,The juice is not worth the squeeze,"Unless you buy a system that is all VISTA ready, then this could be an expensive nightmare. I have a very powerful current system, but VISTA didn't recognize many of my components and there aren't updated drivers for many of my components, such as my printer, graphics card, etc.Perhaps after I have made my computer entirely VISTA compatible, maybe it will have some utility."
2,Review,"I was disappointed by what the book had to offer. The photographs of wierd and bizarre runway styles did nothing to promote the furthing of men in skirts. Quite the opposite, the book did more to throw a negative connotation of skirts for men, making it seem like it could be nothing more than a fringe element that is not acceptable in mainstream society. Despite the inspiring title, the book doesn't deliver."
2,disappointing,"Having heard Ehrlich speak on NPR's Saavy Traveler about her time in Greenland, I had high hopes for THIS COLD HEAVEN. She spoke about the endless nights and endless days of the Artic, the cold and the snow and the ice. It promised to be a meditation on both the inner life of a writer living in relatively isolation and on her discovery of the riches that lay within that dark and cold world.Imagine my disappointment after handing over $... to find a book that was neither poetic nor particularly well done. Ehrlich's metaphors gush without precision. Her historical writing skills are dismall. I could barely get through her retelling of what by all accounts is a riviting history of human exploration of the Artic. The best parts of this book, which desperately needs an editor, were here own narratives. But they could not carry the three hundred plus pages saddled on them. Very disappointing."
2,What a surprise.,"Having previously read and enjoyed two of GE's books, I was excited about the gifting of this book. I first mired down when the author begins quoting other's works ad infinitum but kept slogging through as I enjoyed her descriptions of the area and the people in her own unique way. Again, more pages and pages of others' works. Then, even more and more pages of other's work. When does a work stop being the author's and, perhaps, when should the work be titled an anthology? As a writer, I do marvel at the author's descriptive prowess and recommend her early works."
5,Brilliant book,"I absolutely loved this book. It was amazingly dreamlike and informative at the same time. The inspiration to visit Greenland is so much stronger after reading this book. My own library of Greenland books is huge, but largely historical and/or archaeological. This book brings me ""real"" Greenland. Reading it every night until completed literally inspired many evenings of Greenlandic dreams."
3,"Great Steamer, Amazon has S L O W Shipping on This!","The first package I received was empty! Then I received an e-mail stating they would not be shipping it until February, but they would ship it UPS 2-day. It did get shipped sooner, but it took 4 days, and it was shipped to the wrong address. What a pain! Not really worth saving a few dollars....but when I finally received the steamer, I found it to be great for light/moderate wrinkling. This is perfect to steam button-down shirts and dress pants quickly before work. It's a lot easier using the steamer than taking out the ironing board and iron, and the results are pretty good. It doesn't work well with linen or on clothes that are badly wrinkled."
4,Decent steamer for the price,"I bought this steamer at a store for the same price Amazon was offering. Out of the box, assembly was a bit tricky as the poles were not labeled. Once I got it together and filled it with water, it was steaming like crazy! One downside is that the steamer head won't reach my valences without me putting the steamer on a raised platform (board placed on an ottoman), but for the most part, it does a decent job. For the price, it certainly creates good steam!"
4,Very effective steamer,"I bought this for steaming the wrinkles out of photography backdrops and it does a very nice job. It could use a longer hose, though, which is why it only gets four stars."
5,Steam Heater,"This was a great buy, it gets extremely hot, easy to put together, light weight for easy mobility, small so you can store it in your closet. I would recommend this item to anyone that is looking for these qualities."
3,Steamer,"It appears to be as represented. Though I have not used it a great deal, it seems fine to me."
1,Deceiving-This is labled wrong,"The title states that this is a 1600 watt device. If you click on the link and look at the details, it says its 1200 watt. What is it?"
2,"Cumbersome, not very effective, tiring","It will get out most of the wrinkles if not too deep, but only after repeated swipes. Also, the steam repeatedly slows and you have to let it build up again. I had seen some steamers used by clothing stores that knocked out wrinkles with one pass over or burst of steam. This unit doesn't do that. It will work but it will also make you work. Definitely NOT easier than ironing. Only plus this has over ironing, is there is no risk of getting iron too hot and ruining your fabric or putting a stain on it. And no need for board. But other than that, its a lot of work. I'm still looking for a more powerful hand steamer. No more of these floor models for me. I really don't have a good place to store this thing."
5,THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME ON PS2,"I dont actually own the game, but i played it at friends house. The campaigns not really that great, but the rest is. This is my favorite multiplayer game except for Age of EMpires II on PC. It has awesome 3d levels, several tanks, and differnt ways to play, its sort of like Battle Tanx for 64 but better."
3,Not a very good PS2 Game,"I have given WDL Thunder Tanks an adequate amount of gameplay, but I have not been overly impressed with it.The missions vary from level to level, and there are plenty of cool tanks to choose from. Some of the tanks, such as the one with the flamethrower needs to be seen. The heat effect was pretty impressive. Aside from this I didn't think the graphics were all that mindblowing.In addition, the gameplay is what falters on WDL. After playing through several levels, the gameplay becomes pretty repetitive, and some of the missions get to be a little confusing.Bottomline, if you like mindless games where you can blow stuff up, you may enjoy this. To me, the repetitive gameplay only made this game worthy of a rental and nothing more.Not Recommended!"
2,One More Dreamcast looking game on Ps2,WDL is a alright game with fair graphics. I keep hoping that one of these days I will be able to turn my ps2 on and say now that is some great graphics. I know that graphics are not everything but when your dealing with the legendary ps2 they just have to be there. Gameplay is ok. But I got tired of it after about an hour. Twisted metal 2 it is not. Tanks look nice and the explosions are cool also but the textures look like the first playstation. I think company`s are rushing these games out.
2,World Destruction League: Thunder Tanks,Rented it. Hated it. My six year old boy had fun though. No way this should be rated as high as SSX.
2,*yawn*,"Normally I'm all for explosive combat situations. I bought this game thinking to myself it would be an excellent addition to the PS2 (I was expecting Vigilante 8, just with tanks). Excitement? It's got to be hiding in there somewhere, but I haven't seen it yet. The graphics are ok, but nothing mind-numbing. The gameplay is anything but fast-paced. The areas are dull, the control is obnoxious. The only reason it earned two stars is that it *is* sorta fun in multiplayer mode (if you don't mind the flat-terrain and the dull weapons). Rent it, or better yet, just play V8 on the N64 and forget this even exists."
1,Not good,"This game has confusing graphics, the play-control is horrible, and the game is too repetitive."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GAME.,The game is dumb. Dont buy it. Its a waste of money.All of 3DO's other game's are grate thoe!
4,Crystal Stemware,"Although the authors have done a great job, I felt they could make it better by including a little bit more of the antique european crystal (such as Saint-Louis) and by trying to date the patterns by decades at least(1880-1890, 1920-1930, 1950-1960). Anyway, it is an invaluable source for collectors and crystal buyers."
2,Crystal Stemware Identification Guide Wish List,It was dissapointing that the contents of the book is in gray and white while the cover is in color. Very misleading. Although a multitude of patterns were covered many were sketched. All in all it would be difficult to recognise patterns using just this book.
2,Disappointing guide,"I thought this would be a great addition to my library as I enjoy stemware and was very disappointed that most of the ""images"" are just line drawings and there is no history of lines or anything. I couldn't even find my stemware in the listings and I have several old sets that I have bought over the years. Stick with Gene Florence if you want a really good book on identification. Very lackluster!"
2,Just a Picture Guide....,I purchased this book based on the reviews that were published. I thought they would also have ways to identify different crystal company signatures. I was just expecting more than a picture guidebook.
2,Boring in black & white with drawings,"There is nothing more unappetizing than to look at what should be beautiful, glistening, glorious photos of crystal, only to see sketches or grainy black & white photos."
2,wrong scope cover,this on fits but it is for a wideview scope not a round one as pictured has flat edge on bottom
4,great for a home video,This movie is much better than predicted. It looks more like an indie film rather than a home video gone wild! It also reflects Filipino culture in a way not normally expressed by mainstream media. Makes me want to go out for lumpia more often than I do.
2,eh..,"this bra is disappointing. I was so excited to get it after all of the great reviews. I think that it would be a great bra for smaller chested women. i have always been a 34D, and now after my first pregnancy-currently nursing a 6 month old, I'm a 34-36DD/E. This bra is just a thin piece of material in front, which is hard to tell from just online pictures. I have wanted to return mine, but am not sure if it's too late or not. I just hate spending so much money on a bra that I'm so unhappy with. I did also purchase the bella materna padded nursing bra, and it is fabulous! i wear it all the time, practically everyday, and it is so comfortable and has held up incredibly well. So, I hate to be a debbie downer, but the maternelle is just not the best for larger chested women. :-/"
3,Good and bad,"I loved this bra in the early nursing days when I was a 32DD and needed some ""overflow"" in my bra to accommodate engorgement in between feedings. But when I ordered a second bra in a smaller size after nursing for awhile, I couldn't find a size that worked - in every size the cups pucker, as another review noted. There was definitely not a ""smooth"" look! The straps on the smaller cup size bra were also thinner and cut into my shoulders. And at the same time, there is a tight and itchy feeling. Disappointing! Not sure what to get instead."
5,Love!,"I love this bra! It's comfortable, supportive, & pretty. I got it in pink & it's a lovely shade that can be worn under anything. Definitely my favorite nursing bra."
3,runs small,"buy 1 size up from yours. bra looks great and feels very supportive, very firm, pretty lace, keeps bosom from being too bouncy, quite a bit like a push up bra. very fast shipping. bra is a little too warm for my taste, some synthetic materials, but it looks very nice."
2,not so good,"i got the 36 and it left a horrible red welt under my boob. so it seems to run small. the clasp to unhook to breastfeed is hard to clip back on with one hand. i wish i would of sent it back but i already washed and wore it. oh and if you want a ""uni-boob"" get this bra."
2,Not the best maternity bra...,"After reading the glowing reviews I purchased this maternity bra, however for the price I was not impressed. There is NO lining over the middle of the cups so unless you are wearing nursing pads, the ""headlights"" will be noticeable! Also even though I could tell my bra was brand new, the cups wrinkled slightly toward the center which would be noticeable under clothes. I also didn't think the bra was soft at all. For the price, this bra should be much nicer. I returned mine."
5,"Great Product, Good Price",I was purchasing magnesium directly from my doctor. This was a better product and a better price even with the shipping costs. Highly recommend this product for anyone with a magnesium deficiency (which is far more people than you may think!).
4,Decent,"Decent supplement if you're not naturally eating enough greens, or if you want to soften stool. But, stacked with zinc for a sleep aid it's ineffectual. With or without vitamin B. Studies will also tell you as a sleep aid it's inconclusive. 4 stars because I still supplement with it - just not for sleep. (I use melatonin & L-theanine for sleep)"
1,Not the dosage as it was written,"When I was checking this product to buy it, above the enlarged picture of the product, it was written that the dosage is 400 mg of magnesium (I checked twice!). But, when the product arrived, I figured out that each pill has only 200mg of magnesium, so that I have to take 2 pills per day. If I had known this, I wouldn't have bought it."
5,Good seller,"I read that Magnesium Citrate is the better way to get Magnesium, so I was happy to find this product. Good price, and arrived on time. Will order again."
5,Solgar,Solgar is the best. whenever I can i buy solgar. I like the brown bottle that preserves the strength of the product.
4,Seems to work well.,I bought this to add to my vitamins for cramps. It seems to have helped but I do not take it every day.
3,Stomache ache,"I can't really see a benefit in health from taking magnesium. These pills give me an upset stomach. Maybe it's the type of magnesium, I don't know. Big stomach ache."
4,"Much improved, a few flaws","I had an edition of this atlas that was published in 1965, but was still on sale until recently. As an avid reader of history of all periods, I consulted this atlas quite frequently. The new 2005 edition is much welcome. Many of the maps are identical to those in the older edition, but much has been added. In general, the new edition is less Eurocentric, containing new maps of African, South American and Asian polities. A notable omission is any description of the breakup of the USSR. The map of WWII is not useful, and appears to have been put in as an afterthought. The map of the Vietnam War is good, but the Korean War map is very difficult to read. Very good new maps also include world distributions of languages, religions, income and literacy, as well as descriptions of political, military and econimic alliances. Overall, an excellent resource."
4,Historical Atlas of the World,"I am sure that it is wonderful, but our son got a better, bigger one, for his Christmas gift. Thanks."
5,There's nothing wrong.,I've had no problems with my deck. It still runs the same as when I bought it. I do pampere my equipment however. I've even recorded from my studio equipment to the deck and had minimal generation loss.
1,Poor engineering design,"I've had this model for a few years of satisfactory operation, then the plastic that holds a rubber wheel in place deteriorated and the darned thing's become a real nuisance. The wheel apparently what slows the tape to correct audible speed (with the wheel out, the tape advances at fast-forward and the sound is useless). Now it pops out virtually whenever I remove a cassette tape, and I have to replace it using tweezers. I'm looking for a new cassette deck because I enjoy listening to audiobooks, but I'll be looking for a brand other than Sony."
3,Sony Dual Cassette Deck,The machine is an incredible piece of work for a vanishing recording format. I still need to find a deck with dual mike jacks and the controlsfound on the old Radio Shack Realistic my son borrowed and never returned.
2,my tape deck,"Unfortunately, I have been unable to use the deck because I can't find speakers to fit it.until that happens, i can't render judgement.If anyone reviewing this knows of any I would appreciate hearing from them"
2,Good Product,"This is an excellent cassette deck. It works as it should, i.e., it plays and records music very well."
4,"Tough Headshots, but fun!","The only other Resident Evil game I played is 4 on PS2. I put the series in the top 5 of my list because of it. I bought the Wii version to play later on. I think it made me like this game alot more. Even though this was a game on rails, it was still hard,yet fun to play. You have to have pinpoint accuracy to pull off a headshot. When you finally learn what angle works best for you, it is very satisfying. Other than that I had no problems with the controls. Some of the bosses were really difficult. I actually thought the graphics were great for this type of game. It is alot of fun to play with two people. Pick it up for a bargain price."
4,Different from the original R.E. series and I liked what they did,"I have played a few of the Resident Evil games in the past. If you are looking for the traditional gaming style of fixed camera angles while moving your character around or being able to move your character with a fixed camera behind your character and move around the map in a 3rd person point of view, like in Resident Evil 4, you might be disappointed. This version of Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles is a similar zombie killing adventure with a point and click House of the Dead game play. For quality gaming, play with a gun adapter (Perfect shot, for example). The game was delivered sooner than expected, always preferred. Definitely worth a play if you enjoy zombie games or any of the House of the Dead series. This customer's experience from purchasing and receiving to playing of the game was everything he thought it would be and more."
3,"Fun, but I like the old style of the game better","I got this because it had good reviews and I just got the pistol for the Wii. The pistol makes the game 100 percent better, I cannot imagine playing without it now. The game isn't terrible, but I just don't like the new way that you have to be fixed in position in first person view. I like the third person view better, but it's fun for it's price."
4,"Very nice, but it could be better","Very good graphics and the stories are very nice, but if you play it too much you can end it very fast! And theres no world wide ranking... Personally that what makes better the Darkside Chronicles for me."
1,Just get RE4,"If you are a huge Resident Evil fan, like me this game is not worth it. I purchased this game thinking that it was all my RE games but like house of the dead. I was mistaken, I beat this game only for the added story, they left out major scenes from every game. If you are looking for a good game that is completely worth it, Resident Evil 4 is the way to go."
1,Second thoughts on purchasing RE Umbrella Chronicles...,"As a Resident Evil fan myself, I wondered if I should purchase this RE Umbrella Chronicles or not. But by going on [...] and looking at the gameplays, and by reading some of the comments some people have posted...I'm glad I made a wise choice of not buying this game. Before I even looked at the gameplay for this game, I thought the gameplay of this game would be like the rest of the other RE games I played...but I was wrong. Like what previous people have posted, this game is just like house of the dead on the arcade. When I buy a game, I want to experience the full story, levels, figure out puzzles and experience the whole game. Instead of buying this ""not so good"" game, I instead bought RE Archives and I'm glad I made a wise choice. So if your a RE fan like myself, you would know the difference between the two games =)."
3,"It's still fun, but wasn't quite what I was looking for","I thought a resident evil game would be a great use of the wii's controller. I was going to get resident evil 4, but decided to hold out when I heard they were coming out with a new one. The graphics are fine and it's still a fun game, but what I didn't like is that you don't control the character's movements. Instead, you only control where to shoot. It's particularly annoying when you miss picking up items that scroll by the screen in a second or two and when you know that corpse you just saw on your left is about to get up and attack you (and you can't do anything about it because you're looking the wrong way)."
3,decent game,"The game is pretty fun, just wasn't what I was expecting. It is fun and all but I don't think its worth the 50$ i payed for it."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this game because I was looking for a game my boyfriend and I could play co-op, and I was really disappointed by it. We both love the other RE games and I figured this one would be similar to the rest. I was WRONG. While it did allow us to play co-op, the game also moves you along on its own. You follow a set path and shoot, but you have little control over the speed of movement or the direction your characters will go. It makes it difficult to pick up items on the way, and there were several times when I'd be stuck in one direction while a zombie was chewing on my shoulder behind me - I'd have to wait for the game to turn me around before I could shoot the bugger. To me, having control over my characters' movements is a big plus. I am going to give this game another try after I get a zapper, hoping that the game will get at least a little better as we continue through."
2,Big Dissapointment,"After waiting for the game for some time, i am very dissapointed with what i have seen. The arcade style, where you don't have much control over you're character is very annoying. Compared to RE4 this is a very bad game. The only thing that would make me play it is that i love Resident Evil. Unless you are a big fan of resident evil or enjoy playing arcade games; don't consider this game."
3,Worth a look,"I've been playing the resident evil series for quite a while. while his game is definitely not one of the best in the series, it does provide passive entertainment for people who want to make use of the wii's basic shooter capabilities. the enemies can get pretty redundant, there are no camera controls at all, basically what you have here is an arcade-type shooter game, the type that you come across at the movie theater lobby while waiting for your movie to start. that doesnt mean it cant provide your basic shooter game entertainment. it's certainly no call of duty 4, but if youre just a resident evil fan or need a somewhat close to non-thinking shooter game this is it."
3,Good but not great.,"This is a good game for anyone who is a Resident Evil fan and wanted to revisit some old and new places from the series in a FPS perspective.The graphics are good and are right up there with Resident Evil 4.The control scheme is easy to get used to and the side missions, which reveal some backstory that was not present in other games, are refreshing to have.The difficulty however, will be a turnoff for some people, as this games gets tough really fast and only the most dedicated players will make it to the end and beat it.Either that or I just really suck at it!LOL!Anyways, I think this game is good but could have been better with the inclusion of levels from Resident Evil 4 but whats there is really good though.Being able to upgrade your weapons is a major plus."
3,Not bad,House of the dead meets resident evil.....it's not bad...it's not great the second one in the series is better if you have to get one get that one.
4,Fun,"This is a very fun rail-shooter. The graphics are pretty good and there are different paths you can take. Some parts were very easy, but others can be extremely difficult. I am a huge zombie fan and basically own a Wii to play the zombie shooters. This is one of my favorite zombie rail-shooters"
3,alright,alright this game looked so cool but theres a glitch that makes this game piss me off if u shake the wiimot and it gos out of the screen it freezes and u have to go back to the target and basicly reset the wiimot and when your trying to kill zombies thats no good ill add more latter when i beat the game if i can evin on easy the glitch maks it alot harder
5,Game,These games were gift and enjoyed to this day.Received in a timely manner and in condition stated. Thank you so much
3,Thanks. I've enjoyed it.,I was hoping that the game wasn't like a shooting arcade game but it was. But it was actually an ok game. Gotta love Resident Evil.
3,Poor Controls,"I had the same problems as some of the other reviewers about the controls not being responsive,especially when you have to dodge something.Specifically when I had to dodge the uncoming truck it tells me to press ""A"" and it doesn't do anything.I tried 6 times in a row.It was very frustrating!Anthor thing I don't like that if you die at a boss and stop playing and turn off the system it won't let you start of from there,instead you have to make your way back to it again.The game is supposed to be easier for beginners(like me) on the easy mode but it's not.It's like your playing on normal setting.Most of the bosses are really hard.A much better game,especially for beginners would be House Of The Dead:Overkill.It's a little short but at least the controls work.If I could I would give Resident Evil:Umbrella Chronicles 2 and a half stars."
4,Exciting,"I don't know why so many people dislike this game. I played all resident evils except the first one and loved them, then when I began playing this, I got addicted to the original storylines that they recreated of the old games(although extremely shortened) and on top of that it brought in new chapters covering Wesker, which was the best part of the game because of the new characters and creatures such as TALOS, sergei, and his two defending T-103s. But before you get excited, the game's gameplay IS VERY UNREAL because headshots dont count unless you hit the very top of a creatures head(most of the time it requires more than one shot). Also, just normal shots to the body of a zombie can sometimes take over 15 shots to kill and the games constant need of forcing you to kill every creature can seem a lot more unreal and farfeatched from the original Resident Evils. But besides that, you should buy this, dont listen to the negaive reviews."
1,Complete Deparature from Everything Good in Resident Evil series,We were so excited to buy this game we bought it the day it came out without reading any reviews. Big mistake! We had loved all the other Resident Evil games so much that we had faith this one would also be great. You cannot even control the characters in the game and it's basically just target practice for you and your Wii controller. None of the story line is new. It's all scenes from previous games. Our favorite aspect of previous Resident Evil games is the puzzle-like quality where you need to collect things and figure out how to use them later on in the game. This game required no thinking whatsoever. Very disappointing. $50 down the drain for 15 minutes of disappointment.
1,It was just dissapointing...,"I would be lying if I said that I was a RE fan, my first game was RE 4. I loved RE 4, was fascinated by it and understood why RE was so successful. Umbrella Chronicles was a MAJOR disappointment. The fact that I don't control the character is annoying; I save that when I go to the arcades and play House of the Dead, which is fun but it's an arcade game. I paid 50 dollars + tax to play a game that would make me think. This game is so mindless that I feel my brain cells dying. It was just a waste of my time. Since I first started that game I just didn't like it.I gave it a chance and lost hours of my lifetime that I'll never get back. Don't buy this game. I would only suggest it if you have absolutely nothing to do, and when I say nothing I mean NOTHING."
1,"Probably good, but not for me","A lot of people seem to like this game, so this is really just directed at the uninformed (i.e., nongamers like me whose first experience with the Resident Evil franchise was through its other Wii release, Resident Evil 4).Warning! Resident Evil 4 is nothing like the other games in the series to date, and if you loved playing it, there's no guarantee you'll like this one. I LOVED RE4, but personally hated this one; It felt more like ""Zombie Smash 2000"" than RE4."
1,Video Game,"Sorry not my cup of tea,I guess i'm old fashioned but i just want to point and click ,just too many buttons and options to this game for me."
1,crappy game,this is one terrible game. they took away the ability to walk around and explore your enviroment and replaced it with a arcade shooter. this is compleatly diffrent from all other resident evil games. i was so excited to get this now i just want to throw it away.
4,Amazing,"before I bought this game, i wasn't sure if it's a good idea to play an on rail shooter game. but It was great idea. this game is fun but not perfect. to do critical hits, maybe you need the zapper or reducing the sensitivity of the wii remote. I'm not sure yet but still I can make critical hits hardly. also you need to be fast shooter and collector because sometime you need to pick up something but you are busy killing. better to play with other person.the most things I like in this game are the unlockable stories. example, you can play a character you met but you don't know how did he reach the same place you reached.this game is worth to play. one of the best shooting game in Wii."
4,"Zombies, brains, gore ---- Mmmmmmm that's good!","Great game to play for Resident Evil fans. It's not easy, but not too hard to scare away newbies to the game."
4,Fun for fans of the series and light gun games,"If you're a fan of the series, you don't even have a choice to get this game, you just have to. It continues the series, incorporates stuff from the movies and comics into the game and lets you play through some ""behind the scenes"" stuff from RE 0 through Nemesis"
2,Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles,"This one is like Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles you need to be young to play it and keep up. Not free form like 4 resident evil, which is way, way better"
4,Pretty fun!,"not too bad, but definitely not as good as the real RE games on 360 or PS3, but still fun"
4,"Fans of Rail shooters, rejoice!","If you like lightgun games or the Resident Evil series, this game is for you. Although a bit rough around the edges at times, this game is tremendous fun either by yourself or with a friend (just make sure your partner can aim...)The game would be a great introduction to the RE world, recapping the stories of RE0, RE, RE2, and I assume RE3 although I am not yet there.All in all, a fun game; it is probably going to be a 'game to own' for fans of the Wii Zapper."
2,do yourself a favor,"before buying this game, test-drive it first. i ended up playing this game after playing Resident evil 4, and the only one before that was the original way back in the day, so compared to RE4, this was a sad disappointment. i luckily rented it just to test out the wii zapper on it, and was surprised as many others were at the fact that you can't control your person. i was hoping that this was going to be a step up from the Link's Crossbow Training game which was amazingly fun and easy to use and perfect for the zapper, including the portions of the game you actually control link. unfortunately, RE:UC didn't even match up with its gameplay or graphics."
4,Funner with friends,"This game follows hot on the heels of Resident Evil 4's success and tries to keep with the frantic pace that 4 introduced with its gameplay. Changing the series rather into a 'on-the-rails' shooter similar to House of the Dead series, but does it with more finesse. Its extremely satisfying to blast zombies and monsters with your shotgun in this game. The Wii zapper, although optional, does make it feel more real, despite reloading with it being a bit awkward. But after your first playthrough (on any skill level), it slowly starts to get boring. However, bring in a friend to help kill monsters with you and for some strange reason, it never ceases to be entertaining. So one major suggestion, keep it a nice party game with those who love to shoot stuff up. The story of the game is interesting but overall not the main focal point of the game, the focus is actually on the gameplay and about shooting things up. Never forget that when going in to play it."
3,"Fun, but limited for long-term playability","This game is a basic first-person shooter on rails, meaning you can't control where your character travels.It works very well with the Wii Zapper, which I highly recommend purchasing for this and similar games. But you can also use the regular Wii remote/nunchuck combination.Most players will breeze through the easy setting, but find that normal is quite difficult. Some of the bosses, through repetitive, are very tough and require multiple attempts to beat.If you're a fan of shooting zombies -- and who isn't really -- and own the Zapper, give this game a look."
5,Awesome Wii game.,"This is a great survival horror game and brings a whole new, fresh, Wii experience to Resident Evil. Best survival horror available right now."
3,Ok but not great,"The game itself was ok. The story line was enjoyable; however, the major drawback lays in the controls. I used the Wii Zapper when I played and it was too complicated. The Wii zapper wasn't hard to use, it was the control functions on the Wii remote that weren't too great. You had to press the ""A"" button to pick up things and to dodge things. Since your trigger finger is on the trigger ""B"" button it is hard to reach on top of the Wii controller to press ""A"". Instead of using ""A"", they should have programed the unused button on the Wii naunkaku for dodging, grabbing things, and doing other ""A"" function type stuff."
4,FUN@!,"My son really enjoyed this game. Came as described, would buy from this seller again. Thank you!"
3,I didnt like it as I do with RE4,"This is more a personal review, there isn't nothing wrong with the game itself, but I enjoy the RE4 much more thatn this, the interface of plain FPS is of course good but the type of RE4 is much more enjoyable."
3,Not what I expected,"I have played Resident Evil games on various platforms over the years. I found Umbrella Chronicles a disapointment. You follow a pre-formed attack plan and can't deviate. You just shoot whatever it throws at you. No tactics, no puzzle-solving, just shooting. I prefer being more in control of the game. I should have bought Resident Evil 4."
3,Pros/Cons,Pros:- Heaven for lightgun and Resident Evil fans- Does a good job at tying all the storylines together- Good boss battles- Decent unlockable content- Fun while it lastsCons:- Little replay value- The wii zapper does not really work well with this game- Adding RE2 and Code Veronica could have made this a great game
3,good but not best,"Overall, I enjoyed the book. In the beginning, the hero is totally crass and I did have to wonder where his redeeming graces were. The heroine was well drawn and feisty.But the people who REALLY intrigued me were the side characters of Selene and Kadar. I literally have dog-eared their pages and reread them. I would sit through this book if only to get to sequel with them.Setting was great, there was lots of action (and mulberry trees). Good knights. Bad knights. Knights that you think are bad but maybe are not so bad. Evil assasins. Silk.But Jo, if you ever read this...give us Kadar and Selene. Their ending left me unsatisfied. I wanted to follow them and then you stopped!!"
5,"Fun, Action Filled Adventure Game","I have never been a big fan of quest games for the playstation or nintendo. I typically prefer to play these types of games on a computer. Warriors of MM however is an alsome combination Hack-n-Slash and Quest game. I think the storyline is good (not great), but the controls and fighting are alsome. The monsters are cool (If you are a fan of D&D type fantasy), the graphics are beautiful, and the sound is good. I have been playing this for 4 days now and my wife wants to play when I'm done! This is highly unusual as she typicaly hates ever game I play (Except Spyo) :p So if you're a fan of Hack-n-Slash and/or Quest games, I highly recommend you check this game out."
3,An average game,This game had good graphics and a good plot but it is hard to really get into it. You need to play multiple levels before you can even care about what you are doing. Besides that it is a good game though. Some people prefer certain types of games more than others so it would probably be wise to rent the game before you buy it.
1,GLITCH-O-RAMA,"So there we were...thinking we were having fun...when really we were just being lured into a big bucket o'frustration. What could otherwise be an aweseome game is ruined by glitches...which, of course, always seem to happen after you are waaaaaaaaaayyy into the game and there is no turning back...no solution. PHOOEY!!!"
3,"A good game, but I wouldn't buy it","I rented this game last weekend and thought it was pretty fun. There was nothing overly impressive about the game's graphics or story line, it just has alot of killing. Although I thought this was a fun game I won't suggest buying it because I beat it in the 5 days that I had it. I also completed 95% of the quest and found 95% of the secrets and still beat the game before I had to return it. Overall I thought it was a good game but...I would expect more than five afternoons of play (actually it only took four). To those of you who are interested in this game I would suggest renting it first or finding a cheaper used game."
5,A Fun Game!,"I have never been a big fan of quest games for the playstation or nintendo. I typically prefer to play these types of games on a computer. Warriors of MM however is an alsome combination Hack-n-Slash and Quest game. I think the storyline is good (not great), but the controls and fighting are alsome. The monsters are cool (If you are a fan of D&D type fantasy), the graphics are beautiful, and the sound is good. I have been playing this for 3 days now and my wife now wants to play when I'm done. (This is highly unusual :) ) So if you're a fan of Hack-n-Slash and/or Quest/Adventure games, I highly recommend you check this game out."
3,A good game but I wouldn't buy it.,"I rented this game last weekend and thought it was pretty fun. The wasn't anything overly spectacular about graphics or game play, it was just fun to run around kill things. However I won't buy this game because I beat the entire game in the 5 days that I had it. I also solved 90% of the quest and found most of the secret places and still managed to beat the game before it I had to return it. Granted I did put alot of hours into it but I would expect more that five afternoons of play. Overall I thought it was a good game, it had a lot of action and was very addicting to play. I would just rather spend my money on something that gives me a little more playtime."
1,The worst!,This game was horrible...1. There were way to many useless controls.2. The worst graffics.3. Wierd story thats is hard to understand.4. Horrible sound! They place what people/creatures are saying at the bottom even!I played it for 5 mins. ato. hate!...
4,Whaling History at It`s Best,Short and Sweet...an excellent look back at New London Counties Storied Past.... the makings for a movie!
4,"Good, and different","I have used several different kinds of choral music folders. Some too heavy, some too small. This is a great size, and light weight. However, there are no straps inside to hold your music, just the slots to slip it in.I have added my own straps to it, making it the best overall. And great for the price"
1,Wrong product,"Like others who have reviewed this product, I didn't get the product specified. I instead got an alternate folder, with a clear plastic strip on the binder to put your hand in, and full pockets inside. You can see this in the images that Audrey posted for the product."
4,Tough - To find and in use!,"I had an old electric Wen and a 6"" aborvitae to cut and the old blade wouldn't make a dent. This was a hard-to-find replacement at a very good price and it made short work of the chore. Now if it would grind the stump for me...."
3,good information with some wading to do,"My yellow highlighter got a workout with this book! Well-thought-out arguments and factual information, with a heavily evangelical Christian viewpoint. I don't subscribe to all of the author's views but appreciated the depth of approach to the topic."
1,Pretentious dreck!,When will composers learn that the string quartet is not an effective medium for heroic themes? These composers have far to go.
4,VCR works great,I purchased the VCR for a friend and she says it's plugged in and working well. If you purchase one of these make sure to have the channel selector button on the back in the correct position. My friend had never had a VCR with this button and it took her a bit to figure out why it wasn't working. The remote doesn't appear to be functioning but that's not unusual on older used machines. The shipping was super quick.
1,are you serious?,"i don't know about the vcr slvn80 or dvd player that it matches but, these guys are selling new and even used sony home equipment for more than what i find in my local stores! don't think that because it's on amazon that whatever you are buying is a good deal-my advice is to double check prices elsewhere first."
4,awesome series,"Zed has always been a misunderstood trouble maker with no head for authority. He is continuously searching for something more than what his world will offer to him. Considering the fact that he has no father to speak of and a disabled mother this isn't unexpected, but when his rebellious nature gets to be too much to handle an entirely new world opens to him bringing along with it people driven by greed, power and selfish ambition. Now guided by the mysterios Amil Gaoul and pure determination Zed must uncover the truth of his past and his own power before everyone he cares for is taken by the same strength he fights to control."
3,Pro Feet Youth Nylon Pro Football Sock - 3 Pair Pack,"I don't know why these are classified as youth, because they are really adult-sized. Pro Feet really does stock TRUE youth sizes for rocket football or junior football players, but these are NOT those.Received items quickly. As far as value, they seem to be a good buy. I've gotten one pair of premium socks for the same price as these three (19.00). They appear to be made well and the material blend is good. Mid-weight, I'd say. The white bottom part seems to have the reinforced knitting that is mentioned in the product description."
2,"An interesting idea, but poorly executed","I was certainly not expecting anything equal to Jane Austen's, nor even Georgette Heyer's, writing; but I did hope not to have quite as many jarringly out of period words or phrases jump out at me as did. Nonetheless, I would have given this another star or two, because the setup of the mystery was interesting enough, if the author hadn't decided to make drivelous, nonsensical ""magic"" the cause of the mysterious behavior of various characters. That is most certainly not in keeping with the spirit of Austen's books and characters. It was an interesting idea for a book, but was so poorly executed that I won't be wasting any time or money on any other books in the series."
2,Yet another unnecessary sequel,"While the story is entertaining and readable, the use of P&P characters is quite unnecessary and somewhat distracting. The development of characters reads more like the inspiration came from the BBC mini series than from the novel. Furthermore, the sound of the dialogue is more often than not strictly modern. Who coiuld ever believe the Darcy's would get caught up in something like this!"
5,pride & prescience,"I really enjoyed this book, not so much for the mystery, but for the characters. I think the author has really stayed true to Elizabeth and Darcy, and Austen would approve. I agree with the other readers that a supernatural mystery might not be what Austen would have in mind, but the tie in with Radcliffe was interesting enough. I'd read this book for the characters, not the mystery. Being that Darcy and Elizabeth are so well known, their relationship ends up taking center stage anyway."
2,Barely Tolerable,"This is an okay book for a light read, but very hard to picture the Jane Austen's characters in that role. Elizabeth and Darcy were VERY bland. I missed the intensity Austen was able to create between them. They were very out of character in many ways. If it had been different characters I would have enjoyed it (a bit) more. Although, maybe I wouldn't have ever read it otherwise. If you are going to read this book, just imagine a different, very dull couple and don't expect the Elizabeth and Darcy from P&P."
4,Enjoyable and Easy Read!,I really liked this book and read it several times. The author remained true to the characters from the original P&P while introducing new and interesting characters of her own.
2,Disappointing!,"I picked this book up expecting a cozy mystery set in Jane Austen's world and that's how the book started. I was delighted with the opening chapter! Unfortunately, half way through it quickly turned plausible motives and intrigue into outright absurdity.Caroline Bingley's mind is controlled via a Lord-of-the-Rings-esqu way. Elizabeth and Darcy have their first married fight over the existance of magic. And Darcy, Bingley, and company are all placed under the influence of supernatural forces.I wanted the book to continue with Austen's story, but the story doesn't follow in her vein. Sorry, Elizabeth battling other worldly forces isn't my cup of tea."
3,Darcy and Elizabeth as Mulder and Scully,"I don't know who these people are, but the Mr. and Mrs. Darcy in this book have no more to do with Jane Austen's characters of the same name than they have to do with Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara. The idea of a Regency-era couple solving supernatural mysteries is interesting, but please, please, invent a new couple for the experiment. Leave Darcy and Elizabeth out of it!"
3,Not like the original but filled the time on an airplane,I loved the original P&P.; I bought the movie with Colin Firth and plan to buy Jane Austen's book. This one though I had a tough time believing it was the same Darcy and Elizabeth. The supernatural aspect of the book seemed a bit strange. Darcy and Elizabeth just seemed to conservative to be involved in this sort of thing.If you are looking to read just to fill some time then this is the book. If you are wanting to read to forget where you are and become all consumed by the characters then I suggest a different one. I just kept saying this is too cheesy to be believed.
4,Entertaining mystery story,"Entertaining mystery story based around the characters from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, with Elizabeth and Darcy being of course the main protagonists. This story, the first in a series of Mr. and Mrs. Darcy mysteries, blends Jane Austen's characters with a story of intrigue and a dash of supernatural mystery. I really enjoyed the book; it wasn't deep and philosophical, but it was entertaining with a surprising twist. As a Jane Austen fan, I think this was one of the better ""sequels"" that I've read that creates new stories around her characters. The characters acted in believable ways, and the story kept me interested at all turns. I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the series."
2,A Real Disappointment,"The ""Elizabeth and Darcy"" part of the novel isn't too bad - really it's not much worse than the other Austen adapters out there - and this could've been an enjoyable little diversion. But the ""whodunnit"" part of the book - meh.Perceptive readers will have strong suspicions of the who-will-do-it before page 20. Before page 100 you'll probably figure out most of the why-do-it and how-do-it. If this isn't bad enough, the plotting is so poor that the author has to rely on a really lame plot device to make the solution even remotely plausible.This book had real potential - I wanted to like it, so I oculd get all the books in the series - but fell sadly short. I'd maybe buy another by this author only if I were stuck in an airport with no other choices, and then only if the price were deeply discounted."
1,Just horrible . . .,"I picked up this paperback on a whim, thinking that it was a light mystery based on the characters in Pride and Prejudice. I should have read the reviews here instead of relying on the cover blurb.There is nothing wrong with writing a mystery with a supernatural twist, but it was totally unnecessary to attribute it to a Jane Austen character to whom this sort of activity would be totally foreign.Jane Austen went out of her way in ""Northanger Abbey"" to spoof horrid novels and make fun of impressionable girls who take that sort of thing seriously, rather than looking upon such stories as silly though thrilling diversions.To imagine that she would attribute serious interest in the occult to the generally practical Elizabeth Bennet was absurd and disappointing. Perhaps if the author attributed the interest to a Katherine Morland Tilney having a relapse, I might have bought it . . . ."
3,Not a sequel to P & P,"This book, although fun, was NOT a true sequel to P&P. Elizabeth and Darcy, the jacket says, play a ""Nick and Nora"" detective couple who solve the mysterious accidents and deaths that follow the marriage of Caroline Bingley to a charming plantation owner of supposed fortune from Louisiana. Truth be told, this could have just been a silly murder mystery (and nothing as compelling as an Agatha Christy), but the inclusion of the P&P cast makes it sort of cute. 5/10"
2,Plot was lame. Started OK but no other redeeming features.,"As other reviewers describe, the language is not period (or British) and the plot is horrid. Anachronisms all over the place, especially in the newly introduced characters. The American characters and the Black Magic themes do not work at all.I agree with the reviewers who found the beginning of the book mildly intriguing, with a nice relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth. The book goes downhill from the point when the Darcys discover the newly married Caroline (Bingley) walking in the gutter in the middle of the night.The characterizations of the original P&P; characters are good, the settings and wit are mostly acceptable, but none are excellent or inspiring enough to even begin to overcome the plot deficiencies.This one a loser. I edited my review and gave ""Pride and Prescience"" a second star after reading an even worse P&P; sequal, ""Desire and Duty"". At least ""Pride and Prescience"" had a mildly interesting beginning."
4,The Approaching End of the Age: Viewed in the Light of History,"Haven't read it yet. It is on my to do list, but am glad to have it in my future reading."
2,"Interesting, but full of errors","This is a great book if you want a very brief history of fire engine manufacturers from around the world. However, it is riddled with errors regarding U.S. manufacturers. For instance, it shows a photo of a Mount Horeb, Wisconsin fire truck and claims it's in Canada. The authors do not seem to know that Crown Firecoach went out of business in the '80s and Pirsch did so in the '90s. The coverage of Pierce is pathetically short given its prominence in the U.S. market. If I can find these errors about U.S. companies in just five minutes, one can only wonder how many more there for manufacturers from other countries that I have much less knowledge of. Overall, a disappointing book. Since mine was defective (cut off corner) I will be returning it and will not order a replacement."
1,Be aware,I ordered this item and got a child's video of he same name instead. Check with seller to ensure you are getting what you want.
3,great game until the save function started too play up,The games great but after only one week of owning it the save function started too play up. And while i was getting too a good point in the game and the out of no where i have too goo right back too the beggining of the game again. Im not disrespecting the game because it is a awsome game and the special edition package is awsome too. Its just Amazon sold me a bad copy. So while I could be getting further into grandtheft auto 4. Im getting further into Call of Duty 4 witch i bought from amazon also no problems on that one.
2,A Lot of Nothing--The Best Part is the Duffel,"This game is just like all the other Grand Theft Autos, and the graphics are not where they should be for a PS3 game. The story is simple, which would be fine if it wasn't so complicated to progress."
1,I never received the game,I never received the game and I dont know where to call they already charge to my account
5,WOW,"The product came before it was supposed to and the game was great! It was completely worth it with the art book, dvd and box:)."
5,go to hell glenn beck,"i'm not the best gamer in the world but i just have to say glenn beck is an idiot. surely there's better ways to learn how to run drugs, pimp hoes, and kill cops. after playing gta4, even after the months that will go by, i still don't think i'll last more then 10 minutes if i start killing cops in the real world. even as good as this game is. that said, the amazon pre-order was worth it. i got this before my reserve copy from gamestop so i ended up giving my reserve copy to a friend. the license plate was an awesome addition. nicely packaged. i also appreciated the fact i was able to order this for $90 the day before release and get it upon waking up on the official release date. i wonder how many pedestrians u.p.s. ran over to get it to me... i'm still laughing at the idiots on ebay or craigslist paying $100 or so when they could just get it from amazon. for $90. with the license plate. and new. thanks amazon. well done."
1,You to can conquer this game in 2 hours.,"Well where should I start with this game. I have to admit that I was very curious about this game since I have never played an Army Men game before. I thought to myself if everyone is buying this game then the game could not be bad at all. Well thanks a lot everyone for stearing me down the wrong path. To start out with, the graphics reminded me of the old Chip and Dale Chipmunk Rescuers game for the original Nintendo. This game dones not even come close to taking full advantage of the PS2's power. But you know, I could put that difference aside if the game turned out to be a challenge. Well, it took me about 2 and a half hours to finish the whole game which i guess for my own sake was good since it actually bored me so much that I went back to studying. The only good thing I can say about the game is very easy to learn how play and the short movie segments are somewhat funny. It is games like these that I wish to myself that I didn't sell my old Nintendo."
4,Best Army Man Game Yet,I have played many f the amry men games from the beginig and Air Attack 2 is the best. If you have a PS2 get it for that but if not The PS one is good. Controls are good and the missionsare easy then get harder. The story is easy to follow but still good. The only thing is that the Helicopters that you work so hard to get arent that good and/or realistic. The Osprey shoos unguided bullets and dont do much damage. The Apache wast its 20 bullets fast and the Chinnok ...[is just bad]. The king Cobra is the best. If you get one army man game get this one.
4,could be better,I like the challenges in the first Army Men Air Attack better but its still pretty cool for what it is.
4,Army Men: air attack,My 10 year old son Erik liked this game a lot. He has almost all of the Army Men games.
1,Horrible,"This game was not only horrible, but it was too easy. I beat the game in less than two hours, and never played it again. I do not intend on buying any other Army Men games anytime soon. It was a complete waste of money, and I hope I can stop you from buying it."
2,Poor quality,"I thought this might have great potential, but the quality of the recording is marginal -- a lot of background noise."
1,Good try - Poor performance,I've tried this product on a P4 1.8GHz machine and it was incredibly slow. The quality of the image was poor.
5,Best collection of nonfiction I ever read--inspiring.,"I could not put this book down. An aspiring writer, it filled me with fire to get back to writing in my journal--noting details of the day's people and events with new passion and belief in my own observations. So many of the pieces in the book are wondrous, but I especially liked INTO THE STORM by Jerry Ellis which is from his book, WALKING THE TRAIL, about his 900 mile walk along the Cherokee Trail of Tears."
2,"IF THIS IS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A GOOD CREATIVE WRITER, I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.","I purchased this book for a class on creative writing. Some, but not many, of the short stories are entertaining and were fun to read. Others were so far beyond my level of comprehension, I will never understand them. Perhaps the instructor will be able to point out the value of why someone wrote about the subject and why they made it so complicated to read. I prefer reading true stories, presented in easily understandable sentence structure, not a maze of long complicated words describing something so boring. Also, some of the words were so far out that I think it's probably been 100 years since anyone ever used them. Maybe I'm just not the scholarly type. I can't wait to get finished with this dumb book."
4,As Expected,I received the book quickly and the quality of the book was as described. Since it was a textbook receiving it on time is vital.
4,Good album,"This is a very good album, it's very pleasant. I was surprised how crisp and down-to-earth it sounds, production wise. It's actually folk music that's very spiritual and only slightly exsperimental, though often melodic. 'I only want to love you', which may not necessarily be a love song, is my favourite track. His vocals on the song are good and it has a great melody. There's some acoustic gospel tinges on this album and there's a jazzy number (track four). The last three songs (message/seed/promise) are more psycehdelic.The lyrics are all about Mike's spiritual journey, though some could be interpreted as love songs. None of the songs are bad."
2,From a true blue fan,"The Moody Blues lost a key part of their sound when Pinder split from the band, and although there have been some good songs since, in my opinion they haven't been as consistently good as on their first 8 albums. But this LP reminds me of every part of every Moody Blues record that I didn't like, and I'm a HUGE fan. The lyrics here are quite good, but good music this album is NOT. It's also not well produced and the background singers are dreadful. If Michael Pinder had been hoping for this to launch his solo career it certainly tanked. This album has only two things going for it: It's rare and it has nice cover art."
4,Good Wetsuit,"This wetsuit worked great and was easy to get on our 15 month old but slippery when wet. However it did provide a better grip than without it on. Overall, I would recommend."
5,best there is!!!,I own many instructional books on playing congas and this is simply the best book and dvd that you will find. The instructions and the demos make it very easy to learn even complex rhythms in a very short time. Absolutely outstanding. To anyone who is looking for books on playing congas I say forget all the other books. The Tomas Cruz method is the best there is.
4,ARMY MEN,"I used to play this on N64 all the time and saw a decent deal for a used one for 7.50 and it is sooooooo much more fun than I remembered...it is a tough enough game where you get anxious and just want to keep playing, but not tough enough that you get frustrated and want to not play it."
1,Don't believe the Amazon Reviews this game is no good,"First off let me start off by saying check reviews for this game on game spot you will see a rating of 6.2 out of 10 by 177 votes, there is 18 votes on amazon and somehow it is rated 8.5 out of 10. This is a game that is basically only playable if your a child who wants to play a shooter game that isn't quite as violent, challenging or story driven. Not the worse game in existence, but this definitely a middle of the pack title 3 or 5 stars is generous in my opinion."
4,Great Game,This game is really fun to play. With a friend it is limited to going after each other. Play mode against the computer is a lot of fun. It is very challenging and takes time to master. I recommend it because it is fun and is just like the ones for PS1 but with better graphics and more levels
1,Here is a tip #1: Skip this DVD,"Just how hard is it to produce a meaningful sailing instruction DVD? Apparently it is very hard because I have never seen a good one, they all range from bad to mediocre. This one is bad. Not bad for a single particular reason, but bad universally. The ""tips"" are trivial and borderline useless and one gets the feeling the whole thing was produced in a day of shooting on a digicam.After watching Captain Pete explaining intricate rituals of lowering ones anchor you may be tempted to ask yourself ""Why am I watching this""A short answer is ""Who knows"". Read a book instead."
2,Mediocre Book,"I bought this book based on reviews of others, and found it to be a disappointment. The coverage is mediocre at best, and a lot of the techniques that the author uses are outdated -- probably just carried forward from earlier editions of this book.The thing that bothers me most of all is that throughout this book, the author keeps referring the reader to Volume 2 for coverage of the more advanced topics. Unfortunately, Volume 2 has been delayed for over a year, and may not ever be released. Had I known Volume 2 wasn't coming out soon, I would have gone with a different author for learning servlets and JSP."
4,"Bird, Birds, And More Birds! I loved it!","I love birds and this DVD focuses mostly on various birds yet some other wildlife located in Norfolk (England). It's filmed beautifully, the narrator has a nice voice, and the background music is soothing and nice with a combination of classical symphony, guitar and piano. The scenes of the beaches filled with thousands of birds roosting is incredible!The film takes you through all of the seasons and the many different birds and plants that abound in the areas of Norfolk, most are water fowl. It was interesting to see the difference between young birds and the adults--their various markings, colors, etc.Many of the birds are endangered or quickly becoming so, but the film focuses on the fact that some of these feathered creatures are making a comeback due to the improvement in habitat. I had no idea there were so many types of birds in Norfolk! I don't think any were left out in this 90 minute video."
4,I bought it from curiousity...,I'm taking it because they say it's good. Nothing else to say... Well maybe after 20 years I'll be more healthy lol
